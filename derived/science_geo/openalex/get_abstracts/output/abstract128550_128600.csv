https://openalex.org/W2046563727,"HLA-DM is a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-like molecule that facilitates antigen processing by catalyzing the exchange of invariant chain-derived peptides (CLIP) from class II molecules for antigenic peptides. HLA-DO is a second class II-like molecule that physically associates with HLA-DM in B cells. HLA-DO was shown to block HLA-DM function. Purified HLA-DM-DO complexes could not promote peptide exchange in vitro. Expression of HLA-DO in a class II+ and DM+, DO- human T cell line caused the accumulation of class II-CLIP complexes, indicating that HLA-DO blocked DM function in vivo and suggesting that HLA-DO is an important modulator of class II-restricted antigen processing."
https://openalex.org/W2101622006,"In vascular smooth muscle cells, the induction of early growth response genes involves the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activators of transcription (STAT) and the Ras/Raf-1/mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades. In the present study, we found that electroporation of antibodies against MEK1 or ERK1 abolished vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to either platelet-derived growth factor or angiotensin II. However, anti-STAT1 or -STAT3 antibody electroporation abolished proliferative responses only to angiotensin II and not to platelet-derived growth factor. AG-490, a specific inhibitor of the JAK2 tyrosine kinase, prevented proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, complex formation between JAK2 and Raf-1, the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1, and the activation of ERK1 in response to either angiotensin II or platelet-derived growth factor. However, AG-490 had no effect on angiotensin II- or platelet-derived growth factor-induced Ras/Raf-1 complex formation. Our results indicate that: 1) STAT proteins play an essential role in angiotensin II-induced vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, 2) JAK2 plays an essential role in the tyrosine phosphorylation of Raf-1, and 3) convergent mitogenic signaling cascades involving the cytosolic kinases JAK2, MEK1, and ERK1 mediate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to both growth factor and G protein-coupled receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2076048646,"The small heat shock protein (smHSP) and α-crystallin genes encode a family of 12–43-kDa proteins which assemble into large multimeric structures, function as chaperones by preventing protein aggregation, and contain a conserved region termed the α-crystallin domain. Here we report on the structural and functional characterization of Caenorhabditis elegansHSP16-2, a 16-kDa smHSP produced only under stress conditions. A combination of sedimentation velocity, size exclusion chromatography, and cross-linking analyses on wild-type HSP16-2 and five derivatives demonstrate that the N-terminal domain but not most of the the C-terminal extension which follows the α-crystallin domain is essential for the oligomerization of the smHSP into high molecular weight complexes. The N terminus of HSP16-2 is found to be buried within complexes which can accommodate at least an additional 4-kDa of heterologous sequence per subunit. Studies on the interaction of HSP16-2 with fluorescently-labeled and radiolabeled actin and tubulin reveal that this smHSP possesses a high affinity for unfolded intermediates which form early on the aggregation pathway, but has no apparent substrate specificity. Furthermore, both wild-type and C-terminally-truncated HSP16-2 can function as molecular chaperones by suppressing the thermally-induced aggregation of citrate synthase. Taken together, our data on HSP16-2 and a unique 12.6-kDa smHSP we have recently characterized demonstrate that multimerization is a prerequisite for the interaction of smHSPs with unfolded protein as well as for chaperone activity.

Molecular chaperones belong to a class of proteins whose function is to interact with and stabilize proteins that are partially or totally unfolded, as is the case when proteins are in the process of being synthesized, translocated across a membrane, or damaged by conditions of cellular stress. Many chaperones are expressed at higher levels during biological stresses, and are members of heat shock protein (HSP) 1The abbreviations used are: HSP, heat shock protein; smHSP, small heat shock protein; HSP16-2, 16.2-kDa smHSP; HSP12.6, 12.6-kDa smHSP; CS, citrate synthase; BSA, bovine serum albumin; IgG, bovine immunoglobulin G; H6, pRSET polyhistidine-containing N-terminal tag; SEC, size exclusion chromatography; ANS, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; DTAF, 5-[(4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl)amino]-fluorescein; DTT, dithiothreitol; NBD, 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzene-2-oxa-1,3-diazole; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate. families (1Gething M.J.

The small HSPs (smHSPs) form a structurally divergent protein family with members present in Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya (16Caspers G.-J. Leunissen J.A.M. De Jong W.W. J. Mol.

This domain is preceded by an N-terminal domain, which is highly variable in size and sequence, and is followed by a short, poorly conserved C-terminal extension. Some smHSP genes contain an intron which delineates the N-terminal and α-crystallin domains (21King C.R. Piatigorski J.

Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). A common feature of smHSPs is their formation of large oligomeric complexes. The simplest and best characterized smHSP quaternary structure is the 150-kDa trimer of trimers formed byMycobacterium tuberculosis HSP16.3 (30Chang Z. Primm T.P. Jakana J. Lee I.H. Serysheva I.

Plant smHSPs assemble into complexes of 200–300 kDa (31Waters E.R. Lee G.J. Vierling E. J. Exp. Bot. 1996; 47: 325-338Crossref Scopus (582) Google Scholar), and the typical oligomeric size of α-crystallins and smHSPs from yeast and mammals is between 400 and 800 kDa (29Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar, 32Bentley N.J. Fitch I.T. Tuite M.F. Yeast. 1992; 8: 95-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Several contrasting models have been proposed to account for the arrangement of subunits within the smHSP aggregate. The review by Groenen et al. (29Groenen P.J.T.A. Merck K.B. de Jong W.W. Bloemendal H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) addresses this issue in detail, and suggests that although there is as yet no single consistent model for smHSP quaternary structure, it is likely that the smHSP N-terminal domain is buried in the aggregate whereas the C-terminal domain is exposed at the surface, and that all subunits are in equivalent positions within a roughly spherical aggregate. Numerous in vitro studies have documented the ability of smHSPs to prevent the aggregation of various test proteins at elevated temperatures (26Merck K.B. Groenen P.J.T.A.

In the cell, cytoskeletal elements, which are particularly sensitive to cellular stresses (36Welch W.J. Suhan J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1198-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), appear to be substrates for smHSPs. Specific binding of smHSPs to actin and the intermediate filaments desmin, vimentin, and glial fibrillary acidic protein have been demonstrated (37Chiesi M. Longoni S. Limbruno U. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 97: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Bennardini F. Wrzosek A. Chiesi M. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 39Gopalakrishnan S.

HSP27 has been implicated in regulating the dynamics of actin filaments (41Lavoie J.N. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24210-24214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Landry J. Huot J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1995; 73: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and α-crystallin participates in intermediate filament assembly (40Nicholl I.D. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 945-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Furthermore, HSP27 and α-crystallin can enhance the survival of cells subjected to heat shock or oxidative stresses by conferring increased stability to actin fibers (13Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol.

Biochem. 1996; 242: 55-66Crossref Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although many smHSPs are present during development under physiological conditions, smHSPs are among the most highly inducible HSPs during heat shock or other stresses (15Arrigo A.-P. Landry J. Morimoto R.I. Tissières A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1994: 335-373Google Scholar). Four of over 15 smHSP genes present in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (hsp16-1,hsp16-2, hsp16–41, and hsp16–48) have been shown to be expressed only under stress conditions, in a tissue general manner (46Dixon D.K. Jones D. Candido E.P.M. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 177-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 47Stringham E.G. Dixon D.K. Jones D. Candido E.P.M. Mol. Biol.

Genome. 1989; 31: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). More significantly, their expression correlates specifically with the presence of agents which induce protein damage (50Jones D. Stringham E.G. Babich S.L. Candido E.P.M. Toxicology. 1996; 109: 127-199Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the oligomeric assembly and chaperone activity of smHSPs in general, studies on the structure and function of the 16-kDa C. elegans HSP16-2 wild-type protein and various derivatives were undertaken. We show that binding to unfolded protein and chaperone activity is strictly correlated with the ability of the smHSP to form multimers. The nonconserved N-terminal region is buried within the smHSP complex and is required for subunit assembly, whereas most of the C-terminal extension is not required for multimerization or chaperone activity, but is possibly involved in maintaining the solubility of the complex. Investigations on the binding of wild-type HSP16-2 and derivatives to the cytoskeletal elements actin and tubulin show that smHSPs exhibit little or no substrate specificity and have a high affinity for unfolded, but not for aggregated or native polypeptides. The conclusions from our in vitro mutagenesis studies on HSP16-2 are supported by data from an unusually diminutive (12.6 kDa), naturally-occurring smHSP from C. elegans(51Leroux M.R. Ma B.J. Batelier G. Melki R. Candido E.P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12847-12853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Porcine heart citrate synthase (CS), bovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine IgG, PIPES, EGTA, and 5-[(4,6-dichlorotriazin-2-yl)amino]-fluorescein (DTAF) were from Sigma. ATP, ADP, GTP, and 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) were from Boehringer. MES was purchased from Calbiochem. Pyrene iodoacetamide and 7-chloro-4-nitrobenzene-2-oxa-1,3-diazole (NBD) came from Molecular Probes. Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) was purchased from Pierce. Urea and guanidine hydrochloride were obtained from Aldrich Biochemicals. l-[35S]Methionine was purchased from Amersham. All other chemicals used were analytical grade. Thehsp16-2 coding region had previously been subcloned into the pRSET A expression vector (Invitrogen) at theBamHI-EcoRI site (50Jones D. Stringham E.G. Babich S.L. Candido E.P.M. Toxicology. 1996; 109: 127-199Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar) for producing H6HSP16-2 (i.e. wild-type HSP16-2 fused to an N-terminal 4-kDa polyhistidine-containing tag). A construct designed to express wild-type HSP16-2 was prepared by excising theNdeI-BamHI fragment containing the polyhistidine tag from this plasmid, blunting the ends, and religating. To prepare the vector encoding H6Δ1–15 HSP16-2 (a tagged HSP16-2 lacking the first 15 amino acids), thehsp16-2-containing clone was amplified using polymerase chain reaction and primers 5′-GACTCGAGGTGATCTTATGAG and 5′-CGATGAATTCGTTATTCAGCAGATTTCTCTTCGAC (XhoI and EcoRI restriction sites underlined); the XhoI-EcoRI-restricted polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into pRSET B (XhoI-EcoRI). The vector encoding H6Δ130–145 HSP16-2 (like H6HSP16-2 but missing the last 16 amino acids) was generated by subcloning the polymerase chain reaction product amplified with primers 5′-GCTGAATTCTTATCCTTGAACCGCTTCTTTC and 5′-GCGTGGATCCATGTCACTTTACCACTATTTC into pRSET A (BamHI-EcoRI). The constructs designed to encode H6Δ1–32 and H6Δ1–44 HSP16-2 were prepared by subcloning the PstI-EcoRI fragment of the pH6HSP16-2 vector into pRSET B (PstI-EcoRI), and theHpaI-HindIII fragment of the same vector into pRSET B (PvuII-HindIII), respectively. Thehsp12.6 coding region was amplified from first-strand cDNA and subcloned into the BglII-HindIII site of a modified pRSET A lacking the polyhistidine-containingNdeI-BamHI fragment (51Leroux M.R.

The expression constructs were transformed into the BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli strain, grown to an OD600 of 0.8–1.0, induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and harvested 3 h later (52Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). All HSP16-2 proteins formed insoluble inclusion bodies which were solubilized in TEND buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5) supplemented with 8 m urea. HSP16-2 was first purified by size-exclusion chromatography over Sephacryl S-100 in TEND, 4 m urea. The peak fractions were then dialyzed against TEND buffer, and the native complex was purified by separation on Sephacryl S300-HR in TEND buffer. The polyhistidine-containing proteins were purified by Ni2+-chelate affinity chromatography in 8 murea as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen), and then dialyzed in TEND buffer. HSP12.6 was produced in E. coli as a soluble protein. Cells resuspended in TEND buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm EDTA) were broken in a French press, and the clarified supernatant was chromatographed on Sephacryl S200-HR in TEND buffer. Peak fractions containing HSP12.6 were further purified by chromatography on a hydroxylapatite support. Purification steps were carried out on ice or at 4 °C. All smHSPs were stored at −70 °C after purification (and dialysis) except for H6Δ130–145 HSP16-2 which was only dialyzed before use because of its insolubility following freeze-thawing. To estimate the size of the native smHSP complexes, approximately 5 mg of purified protein was subjected to SEC over Sephacryl S-300HR. The column was first calibrated with the following molecular mass standards: thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (440 kDa), catalase (232 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and RNase A (14 kDa). The proteins were chromatographed on the column in TEND buffer at room temperature. Samples were separated on SDS gels and the elution volume of each was used to estimate the molecular weight. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with an AN 60Ti four-hole rotor and cells with two-channel 12-mm path length centerpieces. Sample volumes of 400 μl were centrifuged at 60,000 rpm. Radial scans of absorbance at 278 nm were taken at 10-min intervals. Data were analyzed to provide the apparent distribution of sedimentation coefficients using the programs DCDT (53Stafford III, W.F. Anal.

Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Acquisition and Interpretation of Data for Biological and Synthetic Polymer Systems. Birkhauser, Boston1994: 156-170Crossref Google Scholar). The partial specific volumes, v̄, at 20 °C, were calculated from the amino acid compositions and the solvent density was 1.00 g/cm3. The degrees of hydration of the totally unfolded proteins was estimated based on the amino acid compositions by the method of Kuntz (55Kuntz I.D. J. Am. Chem.

The degrees of hydration used for all calculations, 0.316, 0.314, and 0.337 g of H2O per g of protein, for wild-type HSP16-2, H6Δ130–145 HSP16-2, and H6Δ1–44 HSP16-2, respectively, were the result of correcting the calculated degrees of hydration by a factor 0.7 obtained by comparing degrees of hydration for several proteins in their folded state to that based on their amino acid composition (57Lin T.-H.

Cross-linking reactions containing 1.5 μm smHSP monomers, 15 μm BSA, and 2 mm freshly prepared BS3 were carried out in cross-linking buffer (25 mm MES, pH 7.5, 25 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm DTT) for 30 min at room temperature and analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody against HSP16-2 (50Jones D. Stringham E.G. Babich S.L. Candido E.P.M. Toxicology. 1996; 109: 127-199Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). H6HSP16-2 was purified and dialyzed against NP buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0). Two samples containing 175 μg of H6HSP16-2 were prepared, one in NP buffer (sample N for “native”) and the other in NP buffer containing 6 murea (sample D for “denatured”). A small amount of Ni2+-chelate affinity resin (30 μl) was added to samples N and D. The samples were mixed for 15 min, then washed twice with NP buffer (without urea for sample N and with 6 m urea for sample D, both at pH 6.3), and any bound protein was eluted with 100 mm EDTA. Aliquots of the pH 6.3 and EDTA washes of sample N and the EDTA washes of sample D were analyzed on a 12% SDS gel. The thermally-induced aggregation of a 900-μl citrate synthase solution (150 nm monomers), with smHSPs or control proteins, was measured by light scattering at 320 nm in a Cary 210 Varian spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cell compartment preheated to 45 °C. The effect of HSP16-2 on the chemically-induced aggregation of CS was measured in an SPF-500C™ stirred-cell spectrofluorometer with excitation and emission wavelengths set to 500 nm and a band pass of 2 nm. CS was denatured in 6 m guanidinium chloride for at least 45 min and diluted 100-fold in a total volume of 2 ml to give a final monomeric concentration of 200 nm. All aggregation experiments were carried out in 50 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.5, and normalized to control experiments in which aggregation with CS alone was defined as being 100% of total CS aggregation. The kinetics of HSP16-2·actin and HSP16-2·tubulin binary complex formation were measured by diluting35S-labeled 7.5 m urea-denatured β-actin or β-tubulin (prepared as described in Ref. 58Melki R. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) 100-fold (final actin and tubulin concentrations were approximately 225 nm) into a solution containing 1.6 μm HSP16-2 complex and mixing quickly. Appropriate dilutions of HSP16-2 were prepared using “refolding buffer” (25 mm MES, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.5 mm DTT). At each time point, 20 μl of the reaction mixture was mixed with 5 μl of glycerol and frozen immediately in an ethanol/dry ice bath. Samples were then separated on 4.5% nondenaturing gels (58Melki R. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To measure the binding of HSP16-2 actin and tubulin intermediates formed along the aggregation pathway, 35S-labeled denatured actin or tubulin was first diluted into refolding buffer and incubated for various lengths of time. At each time point, an aliquot was added to a tube containing HSP16-2 such that the concentration of HSP16-2 oligomers was 1.6 μm and that of actin/tubulin approximately 225 nm. The binding was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature, and the reactions were analyzed on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. The yield of binary complex was quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Actin was purified from rabbit muscle acetone powder (59Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 60Eisenberg E. Kielley W.W. J. Biol.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 96: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar) at 4 °C equilibrated in 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.2 mm DTT, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.1 mmCaCl2, 0.01% NaN3. G-actin (50 μm) was stored on ice and used within 2 weeks. Pyrenyl-labeled actin and NBD-labeled actin were prepared according to Kouyama and Mihashi (62Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) and Detmers et al. (63Detmers P. Weber A. Elzinga M. Stephens R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 99-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Pure tubulin was prepared from fresh pig brain by three assembly-disassembly cycles (64Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1977) Google Scholar) followed by phosphocellulose (Whatman P11) chromatography (65Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). Tubulin (100–150 μm) in 0.1m PIPES, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmMgCl2 and 1 mm GTP was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. DTAF-labeled tubulin was prepared as described by Mejillano and Himes (66Mejillano M.R. Himes R.H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6518-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Native pyrenyl- or NBD-actin and DTAF-tubulin were denatured by addition of urea to a final concentration of 7.5 m. All measurements were made at 20 °C in a Spex fluorolog 2 spectrofluorometer. The excitation monochromator was set at 345, 468, and 492 nm and the emission recorded at 386, 535, and 517 nm for pyrenyl-actin, NBD-actin, and DTAF-tubulin, respectively. SmHSP protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit and bovine IgG as standard. The concentration of CS was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of 1.55 × 10−5m−1 cm−1 (67Singh M. Brooks G.C. Srere P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 4636-4640Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of HSP16-2 and H6Δ130–145 complexes were calculated according to the average of the two molecular masses obtained by sedimentation velocity measurements (317 and 421 kDa, respectively). All other smHSP concentrations were based on the calculated molecular weights. Actin and tubulin protein concentrations were determined by the Lowry method (68Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular weights of 42,000 and 100,000 were employed for actin (69Gordon D.G. Yang Y.Z. Korn E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 7474-7479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and tubulin (70Krauhs E. Little M. Kempf T. Hofer-Warbinek R. Ade W. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4156-4160Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), respectively. Although the sizes of smHSPs vary considerably, a detailed sequence comparison of known members suggests that the minimal functional unit consists of a core region of about 85 amino acids (the α-crystallin domain) which is flanked by an N-terminal region of at least 39 residues (in E. coli IbpA), and a C-terminal extension of at least 12 residues (in Neurospora crassaHSP30). Accordingly, the most compact smHSP characterized to date isE. coli IbpA, which has a very short C terminus of 14 residues and totals 137 amino acids (15.8 kDa). A novel family of 12.2–12.6 kDa smHSPs from C. elegans represents the only known exception to the apparent minimum size restriction of smHSPs; interestingly, one of"

Zimm G.G. The Genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). Clinical and experimental evidence has also identified TNF as a mediator of chronic autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (2Elliott M.J. Maini R.N. Feldmann M. Kalden J.R. Antoni C. Smolen J.S. Leeb B. Breedveld F.C. MacFarlane J.D. Bijl H. Woody J.N. Lancet. 1994; 344: 1105-1110Abstract PubMed Scopus (1667) Google Scholar) and Crohn's disease (3Van Dullemen H.M.

The Genome of Drosophila melanogaster. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1992Google Scholar). Accordingly, TNF has become a primary target for therapeutic intervention of several inflammatory diseases. TNF is initially synthesized as a 26-kDa membrane-bound protein (pro-TNF) that is subsequently cleaved to release soluble 17-kDa TNF with an NH2 terminus of Val77 (4Pennica D. Nedwin G.E.

The identity of the protease(s) responsible for TNF processing remains controversial. Robache-Gallea et al. (5Robache-Gallea S. Morand V. Bruneau J.M. Schoot B. Tagat E. Realo E. Chouaib S.

In 1994, the partial isolation and characterization of a membrane-bound activity capable of generating the 17-kDa form of TNF were reported (6Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P.

Nature. 1994; 370: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The TNF-processing enzyme was thought to be a non-matrix metalloprotease since it was not inhibited by TIMP-1,2 or phosphoramidon, and no calcium requirement was detected. More recently, two members of the ADAM family (TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE) and bovine ADAM 10 (BoAD10)) have been shown to possess pro-TNF processing activity (7Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J.

In this report we describe the isolation, cloning, and characterization of a TNF-processing enzyme from the human monocytic cell line THP-1. The purified recombinant enzyme, rHuAD10, specifically recognizes the authentic cleavage site in pro-TNF and is sensitive to metalloprotease inhibitors that block soluble TNF production (6Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Anderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S. Otten-Evans C. Greenstreet T. Weerawarna K. Kronheim S.R. Petersen M. Gerhart M. Kozlosky C.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Dinitrophenol-labeled polypeptides were synthesized by the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/t-butyl-based solid phase peptide chemistry method using an Applied Biosystems, Inc. 431A peptide synthesizer (10Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6751) Google Scholar). All peptides were purified by reversed phase HPLC, and molecular weights were verified by mass spectrometry. TNF processing activity was measured as the ability to cleave a 12-residue peptide spanning the Ala76-Val77 site in pro-TNF. The chromatophoric peptide substrate DNP-SPLAQAVRSSSR-CONH2 was dissolved to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 40 mmTris-HCl, 100 μm ZnCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% octylglucoside. Protein samples were diluted 1:1 with the peptide substrate and allowed to incubate for 1 h or longer at 37 °C, depending on the relative activity of the sample. The unhydrolyzed substrate and cleaved peptides were separated using a Beckman System Gold HPLC with a Vydac C18 reversed phase column (4 mm × 30 cm), and the eluate was monitored at 350 nm. The peptides were eluted using linear gradients of CH3CN/water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Mass spectrometry confirmed that the peptide fragments produced by the partially purified protein or rHuAD10 had the correct molecular weight. One milliunit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 mmol of peptide substrate cleaved/min/mg of protein at 37 °C. THP-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were grown in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1% glutamine penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. THP-1 membranes were prepared essentially by the method of Maeda et al. (11Maeda T. Balakrishnan K. Mehdi S.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 731: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) except that dithiothreitol was omitted, and 200 μm phosphoramidon was added to all of the buffers. Membranes were homogenized in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PefablocTM, 200 μmphosphoramidon, 1.3 μm aprotinin, 5 μmleupeptin, 30 mm NaCl. Octylthioglucoside and NaCl were next added to final concentrations of 2% and 0.5 m, respectively. The mixture was rocked at 4 °C for 3 h and then centrifuged at 180,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was recovered and assayed for TNF processing activity. Membrane extracts were diluted 25-fold with buffer A (20 mm NaOAc, 20 mm monobasic sodium phosphate, pH 5.0, 10% glycerol, 0.5% octylglucoside, 50 μm phosphoramidon) and brought to a NaCl concentration of 20 mm. The mixture was clarified by filtration before being loaded onto an S-Sepharose column previously equilibrated with buffer A. The proteins were eluted in 10 column volumes with a linear gradient to 100% of buffer B (20 mmNaOAc, 20 mm dibasic sodium phosphate, pH 10.0, 10% glycerol, 0.5% octylglucoside, 50 μm phosphoramidon). The pH of the collected fractions was adjusted immediately to 8.0 with 1 m Tris base. The active S-Sepharose fractions were pooled and diluted 1:1 with buffer C (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 150 mmNaCl). Additional protease inhibitors were added to final concentrations of 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mmPefablocTM, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 50 μmphosphoramidon. The protein pool was next applied to a wheat germ lectin-Sepharose column equilibrated in buffer C. The column was washed with additional buffer C and eluted with 500 mm N-acetylglucosamine. A majority of the original activity was present in the flow-through (69%) which was taken forward onto the next column. The wheat germ flow-through pool was concentrated, diluted 1:4 with buffer D (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.6, 10% glycerol, 0.5% octylglucoside, 50 μm phosphoramidon), loaded onto an HA-Ultragel column, and eluted with a linear gradient from 10 to 400 mm sodium phosphate in buffer D. A majority of the activity was detected in the flow-through, whereas many of the contaminating proteins bound to the HA resin. The HA flow-through was concentrated and the components separated by SDS-PAGE using a 10% Tris-glycine gel (NOVEXTM, San Diego) followed by transfer to polyvinyldifluoride membrane and Coomassie R-250 Brilliant Blue staining. NH2-terminal sequencing of the proteins was performed by automated Edman degradation on a ProciseTM 494 microsequencer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.). HuAD10 cDNA was amplified by PCR using an oligonucleotide primer (5′-ACT TAT TAA GAT CTC GGA AGA TGG TGT TGC (CT)GA (CG)AG TG) derived from the 5′-ends of bovine (12Howard L. Lu X. Mitchell S. Griffiths S. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and murine sequences 2Amgen cDNA data base, unpublished results. and a primer (5′-AAG CTA ATT GCG GCC GCC AAA AGC TGC AGT TAG CGT CTC ATG) derived from the 3′-end of the human sequence (12Howard L. Lu X. Mitchell S. Griffiths S. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The PCR was carried out using Advantage KlenTaqTM DNA polymerase as described by the manufacturer (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), with 2 × 107 plaque-forming units of a human macrophage cDNA library cloned in λZAPIITM (Stratagene, La Jolla) as template. A single band of the expected size, 2.2 kilobases, was generated using these conditions. The PCR was then repeated in the presence of radiolabeled nucleotide, and the32P-labeled product was used to probe the human macrophage cDNA library used in the PCR. Positive hybridizing clones were plaque-purified, and phagemid DNA (pHuAD10) was excised as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). A human immune system multiple tissue blot (Clontech) was probed with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled TNF cDNA probe using conditions described by the manufacturer. The blot was then stripped and probed with an [α-32P]dCTP-labeled HuAD10 cDNA probe. HuAD10 cDNA lacking the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail coding sequences was fused in-frame to a human IgGγ1 heavy chain hinge and CH2 and CH3 domains. The HuAD10 portion was prepared by PCR amplification of a 2,036-bp DNA fragment spanning the initiation codon to the codon corresponding to Glu672. The 5′-DNA oligonucleotide primer (5′-GTG GCA CCA AGC TTG CCA CCA TGG TGT TGC TGA GAG TGT TAA TTC) contained aHindIII restriction site and a Kozak sequence, whereas the 3′-oligonucleotide primer (5′-GAG CTG GAC CGC GGC CGC TTC AGC AAT GTT TTC ATA GAG CTC) contained a NotI restriction enzyme site. PCR was performed on pHuAD10 using Pfu polymerase as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene). The resulting PCR product was then digested with HindIII and NotI and then ligated into the human IgG vector, pFC-A3.3 TheHindIII-XhoI fragment containing HuAD10-Ig was then cloned into the mammalian expression vector, pCEP4 (Invitrogen, San Diego) to create pHuAD10-Ig. For mammalian expression, 2 × 106 293-EBNA cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with 10 μg of pHuAD10-Ig using LipofectAMINETM as described by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 24 h, the cells were split 1:5 into medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin. The drug-resistant cells were expanded and used to seed Nunc cell factories at a density of 1.4 × 105 cells/cm2. Factories were incubated at 37 °C with 10% CO2 in serum and hygromycin-supplemented medium for 6 days. After reaching confluence (approximately 106 cells/cm2), the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and then incubated in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1 × l-glutamine and 100 μg/ml hygromycin. The medium was conditioned for 7 d at 37 °C before harvesting. 6 liters of conditioned medium from THP-1 cells was concentrated 10 × using a Filtron 50-kDa filter and dialyzed extensively against 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol (buffer E). The protein mixture was applied to an HA-Ultragel column previously equilibrated in buffer E. rHuAD10 was eluted from the resin using a phosphate gradient from 10 to 400 mm phosphate in buffer E. The active HA fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate, 1.5m ammonium sulfate, pH 7.0 (buffer F) before being loaded onto a butyl-Sepharose HP column equilibrated in buffer F. rHuAD10 was recovered from the resin using an inverse salt gradient from 1.5m to 0.5 m ammonium sulfate in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0. Active fractions from the butyl-Sepharose column were concentrated, buffer exchanged in 150 mm ammonium bicarbonate, 0.3% CHAPS, pH 8.1, then applied to a Superdex 200 (HR 10/30) gel filtration column. A peptide (DANQPEGRKCKLKPGKQ) derived from amino acids 486–502 in rHuAD10 was synthesized and injected into rabbits to generate polyclonal antiserum AMG1961. For immunoblotting, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocelluose. Filters were incubated in blocking buffer (5% skim milk in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then treated with AMG1961 (1:1,000) in blocking buffer for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, filters were incubated with anti-rabbit IgG (Fc) AP conjugate (Promega, Madison, WI) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Immune complexes were visualized by incubating with Western Blue stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase (Promega) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The human pro-TNF coding sequence was inserted into the EcoRI site of pCRII (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA was transcribed and translated using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation kit (TNTTMSP6-coupled Reticulocyte Lysate System, Promega) with [35S]cysteine (Amersham Corp.), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The lysate was dialyzed against a 250-fold excess volume of buffer consisting of 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, and 10 mm NaCl for 3 h at 4 °C. After dialysis, pro-TNF was incubated with a partially purified protein preparation with TNF processing activity (S-Sepharose pool) or rHuAD10 + 50 μm ZnCl2 for 10 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixtures were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-human TNF polyclonal antibody (Amgen Inc.) before SDS-PAGE analysis. A purification scheme for the isolation of a TNF-processing enzyme from THP-1 membrane extracts was optimized using an assay based on the specific proteolysis of a peptide spanning the pro-TNF cleavage site. Purification recoveries after cation exchange, lectin affinity, and hydroxyapatite chromatographies are shown in Table I. During the final column step, we saw a decrease in specific activity which was indicative of protein instability, even in the presence of detergents and glycerol. A protein blot from a final preparation with TNF processing activity is shown in Fig.1. Although we were unable to purify the active component to homogeneity, the correct proteolytic activity consistently tracked with the presence of a 62-kDa protein having an NH2 terminus of SAEKNTXQLYIQTDHLFFKYYG. A search of this sequence against GenBank revealed a high homology with the NH2 terminus of BoAD10. This protease is the 10th member of a family of proteins known to contain both “a disintegrinand metalloprotease domain.” ADAM 10 was previously purified from bovine brain, but its physiological function was not known (12Howard L. Lu X. Mitchell S. Griffiths S. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Copurifying with HuAD10 were nonproteolytically active proteins including bovine serum albumin (from the growth medium), l-plastin (an actin-binding protein), and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase α-chain.Table IPurification recoveries for a TNF-processing enzymeSampleTotal proteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationmgunits × 10−3(milliunits)milliunits/mg total protein−foldMembrane extract1752731.561S-Sepharose pool0.83101.512781Wheat germ pool0.1472.4517331HA pool0.0629.4507325THP-1 cells were used as starting material for the isolation and identification of a protease responsible for the TNF processing activity present in the cell membranes.

A search of GenBank revealed that a partial HuAD10 cDNA lacking the 5′-end had been deposited by P. Glynn (12Howard L. Lu X. Mitchell S. Griffiths S. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). PCR and hybridization techniques were used to identify a full-length cDNA from a human macrophage library. The HuAD10 cDNA is 3,410 bp (Fig. 2) consisting of a 469-bp 5′-untranslated region, a 2,244-bp sequence encoding a protein of 748 amino acids, and a 697-bp 3′-untranslated region. Northern blot analysis (Fig.3 A) demonstrated that a single transcript of approximately 5.0 kilobases (also detected by Howardet al. (12Howard L. Lu X. Mitchell S. Griffiths S. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) in five human cell lines) was present in all tissues examined. When the same blot was hybridized with a TNF-specific probe, TNF mRNA was detected in three of the six tissues tested (Fig. 3 B). The deduced amino acid sequence of our clone is identical to the published partial sequence of HuAD10 except that we observed a glycine at amino acid 296 instead of a serine. Overall, HuAD10 is 96.7% identical to BoAD10 and 97.1% identical to a partial cDNA encoding rat ADAM 10 (12Howard L. Lu X. Mitchell S. Griffiths S. Glynn P. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Figure 3Northern blot analysis of HuAD10 and TNF in human tissues.

Akizuki S. Yamamoto S. Int. Immunol. 1990; 2: 585-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)). Analogous to other ADAM family members, HuAD10 possesses propeptide, metalloprotease, disintegrin, and transmembrane domains (Fig. 2) (14Wolfberg T.G. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The HuAD10 propeptide is predicted to end at amino acid 213 with a tetrabasic motif (RKKR) that might serve as a cleavage site for furin-like proteases in the Golgi (15Watanabe T. Nakagawa T. Ikemizu J. Nagahama M. Murakami K. Nakayama K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8270-8274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The propeptide of rHuAD10 contains a single cysteine at amino acid 173 which may be regulating the activity of the enzyme through a cysteine switch mechanism as with other metalloproteases (16Woessner J.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2145-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (3091) Google Scholar). Mature HuAD10 is predicted to have 535 amino acids with a calculated M r of 59,286. The difference between the calculated M r of HuAD10 and its apparent M r of 62,000 on SDS-PAGE is likely because of glycosylation, as HuAD10 has four potential sites forN-glycosylation (Fig. 2). To obtain rHuAD10, a soluble ADAM 10-Ig construct was generated and transfected into 293-EBNA cells. Immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific to HuAD10 demonstrated the expression of 98-, 72-, and 62-kDa proteins in the conditioned medium of transfected cells (Fig.4 A). Isolation and characterization of these proteins revealed that TNF processing activity tracked only with the 62-kDa protein. Since the 98-kDa band cross-reacts with an antibody against human Fc, but the 62- and 72-kDa proteins do not (data not shown), we suspect that the proteolytically sensitive Fc hinge region was cleaved from the 62- and 72-kDa proteins by proteases present in 293-EBNA cells or conditioned medium. A silver-stained gel demonstrating purification of the 62-kDa rHuAD10 to homogeneity is shown in Fig. 4 B. rHuAD10 has a specific activity of 1,000 milliunits/mg of protein and an NH2terminus that is identical to that of HuAD10 purified from THP-1 cells. To characterize the proteolytic activity of rHuAD10 versus a partially purified protein preparation (S-Sepharose pool), we assayed for TNF processing activity in the presence of a variety of protease inhibitors. Relative activities, shown in Table II, reveal that the S-Sepharose pool and rHuAD10 have comparable profiles. Results indicate that the serine protease inhibitors had little effect on proteolytic activity, and no significant inhibition was observed with the matrix metalloprotease inhibitors phosphoramidon and TIMP-1. In contrast, known metal chelators (EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline) inhibited the proteolytic activity in both protein preparations.Table IICharacterization of rHuAD10InhibitorsProtease classrHuAD10S-Sepharose pool% inhibition% inhibitionPhenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10 μm)Serine014.5Leupeptin (1 μm)Serine, thiol0.55.4Aprotinin (0.3 μm)Serine38.6Pepstatin (1 μm)Aspartic00EDTA (1 mm)Metallo88531,10-Phenanthroline (1 mm)Metallo10086Phosphoramidon (10 mm)Metallo00TIMP-1 (20 nm)Metallo012Protease inhibitors were added to each protein preparation at a concentration recommended by the manufacturer.

Maximum TNF processing activity for both protein preparations was between pH 9 and 10 (data not shown). The substrate specificity of rHuAD10 was examined by testing its ability to cleave a variety of peptides with substitutions surrounding the Ala-Val cleavage site. The influence of these substitutions on peptide cleavage is shown in TableIII. Alterations at Ala76except for A76Y and A76K resulted in a significant decrease in cleavage efficiency. rHuAD10 was better able to tolerate changes at Val77. Substitutions with Leu, Ile, Arg, Tyr, and Ser had no effect on the ability of rHuAD10 to catalyze peptide cleavage.Table IIIInfluence of substitutions at the pro-TNF cleavage siteWild type sequence7273747576777879808182ProLeuAlaGlnAlaValArgSerSerSerArgSubstitutionsSubstitution% cleavageSubstitution% cleavageWild type100V77G0A76D0V77E0A76L0V77P0A76G11V77W49A76T27V77L100A76S39V77I100A76P63V77R100A76Y95V77Y100A76K100V77S100R78K33S79E10R78T94S79T77R78Q100S79R100DNP-peptides were synthesized and assayed as described under “Materials and Methods.” rHuAD10 was used as the enzyme source.

We examined peptide sequences spanning the cleavage sites for other proteins known to be shed proteolytically from the cell surface (TableIV).

Open table in a new tab DNP-peptides spanning the proposed cleavage sites of a variety of membrane-bound proteins were assayed in the HPLC assay in place of the DNP-pro-TNF cleavage peptide as described under “Materials and Methods.” rHuAD10 was used as the enzyme source. Samples were incubated for 17 h at 37 °C and quenched with 2.5 mm EDTA before analysis. * represents a proposed proteolytic cleavage site. The purification of HuAD10 from THP-1 cells was based on pooling active fractions as determined by the HPLC peptide assay. To verify that HuAD10 is capable of processing full-length pro-TNF, in vitro translated 35S-labeled pro-TNF was treated with a partially purified HuAD10 (S-Sepharose pool) or rHuAD10. After immunoprecipitation, the reaction mixtures were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. Fig. 5 shows that both protein preparations cleaved a portion of the 26-kDa pro-TNF to a 17-kDa species corresponding to the molecular weight of soluble mature TNF. It is not known if the processing efficiency of HuAD10 is enhanced when colocalized with pro-TNF on cell membranes. Characterization of rHuAD10 suggests that it has many of the physical and biochemical properties required of a TNF-processing enzyme. Our data indicate that HuAD10 specifically recognizes pro-TNF and is not a general protease involved in the shedding of other cell surface proteins. rHuAD10 processed full-length pro-TNF to a 17-kDa form and cleaved the pro-TNF peptide sequence at a site that corresponds to the authentic NH2 terminus (Val77) of soluble TNF. We also show that substitutions surrounding the cleavage site adversely affect the ability of rHuAD10 to cleave the pro-TNF peptide. Furthermore, rHuAD10 failed to recognize and process peptides spanning the cleavage sites found in other membrane-associated proteins known to be shed proteolytically. These data are consistent with the expectation that a TNF-processing enzyme would have a preferred specificity for its substrate, pro-TNF. Our inhibitor studies demonstrate that HuAD10 is a functional metalloprotease since it is effectively inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline. Interestingly, two metalloprotease inhibitors, phosphoramidon and TIMP-1, had no effect on TNF processing activity. These results agree with previous experiments that showed an essentially identical inhibition profile for a partially purified TNF-processing enzyme (6Mohler K.M. Sleath P.R. Fitzner J.N. Cerretti D.P. Anderson M. Kerwar S.S. Torrance D.S. Otten-Evans C. Greenstreet T. Weerawarna K. Kronheim S.R. Petersen M. Gerhart M. Kozlosky C.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Nature. 1994; 370: 218-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). The protease responsible for TNF processing is likely to be membrane-bound and present on cells that secrete high levels of TNF. Accordingly, THP-1 cells were chosen for purification of the protease. HuAD10 appears to be an integral membrane protein since it fractionated with cell membranes rather than the cytosol. Additionally, it has a classical transmembrane domain. Attempts to verify its presence on the cell surface using fluorescence-activated cell sorting with AMG1961 have not been successful since this antibody does not recognize native HuAD10. We are generating monoclonal antibodies against rHuAD10 to address this question in the future. Northern analysis indicates that HuAD10 mRNA is found in tissues that have detectable TNF mRNA (e.g. spleen, lymph node, peripheral blood leukocytes). Thus, the expression and presumed localization of HuAD10 in cells are consistent with a potential role for this protein in TNF processing. It is not known if HuAD10 has additional functions in tissues that do not express TNF. Recently, Lunn et al. (9Lunn C.A. Fan X. Dalie B. Miller K. Zavodny P.J. Narula S.K. Lundell D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) have shown that a protein preparation enriched in BoAD10 cleaves pro-TNF or a peptide spanning the pro-TNF cleavage site. We have purified rHuAD10 to homogeneity and have shown that this protein possesses high intrinsic activity for cleaving similar substrates. Lunn et al. (9Lunn C.A. Fan X. Dalie B. Miller K. Zavodny P.J. Narula S.K. Lundell D. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 333-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) also reported that 293-EBNA cells processed pro-TNF only when cotransfected with BoAD10 cDNA. We observed that 293-EBNA cells produced substantial amounts of soluble TNF when transfected with pro-TNF. Cotransfection with HuAD10 did not significantly increase soluble TNF above the already high background. We did observe small increases in soluble TNF when insect cells were cotransfected with HuAD10 and pro-TNF, compared with insect cells singly transfected with pro-TNF (data not shown). Interestingly, other ADAM family members have been recently shown to process pro-TNF (7Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P.

Immunol. 1996; 26: 2000-2005Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Of this group, TACE is the only member that is membrane-bound and found in mammals. Significantly, mutant T-cells lacking TACE were found to be greatly impaired in secreting TNF when stimulated by anti-CD3e (7Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). However, it has not been shown if TACE is also an important regulator of soluble TNF production in human T-cells or monocytes that are activated with physiological stimuli. Also yet to be determined is what role, if any, TACE may play in the release of other membrane-bound proteins such as L-selectin, interleukin-6 receptor, or the TNF receptors. TACE and HuAD10 have significant sequence and structural homology and may represent two members of a family of TNF-processing enzymes. We have screened cDNA libraries for novel ADAM family members based on conserved sequences from known members including HuAD10 and have isolated unique ADAM family cDNAs including TACE (data not shown). Recombinant proteins expressed from these cDNAs are now being compared with respect to their relative abilities to process pro-TNF.

Galanin is a neuropeptide with a broad distribution in both central and peripheral nervous systems. Within the central nervous system, high levels of galanin are found in the hypothalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, basal forebrain, brainstem nuclei, and spinal cord (1Skofitsch G. Jacobowitz D.M.

In the periphery, galanin is found in the gastrointestinal tract, adrenal medulla, dorsal root ganglia, and sympathetic neurons (6Bauer F.E. Adrian T.E. Christofides N.D. Ferri G.L. Yanaihara N.

Palyha O.C. McKee K.K. Weinberg D.H. Feighner S.D. Cascierie M.A. Smith R.G. Van Der Ploeg L.H.T. Sullivan K.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) which was reported to have a pharmacological profile similar to the GALR1 receptor. We provide evidence here that GALR2 is distinct from GALR1 in both its pharmacological profile and its primary signal transduction pathway. A plasmid cDNA library was constructed as described previously (23Gerald C. Walker M.W. Vaysse P.J-J. He C. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26758-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) from 5 μg of rat hypothalamus poly(A)+ RNA. A total of 2.6 × 106 independent clones with a mean insert size of 2.2 kb 1The abbreviations used are: kb, kilobase(s);125I-pGAL, 125I-porcine galanin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; TM, transmembrane domain; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5'-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. were generated. The library was plated on agar plates (ampicillin selection) in 584 primary pools of ∼4,500 independent clones. Preparation and transfection of library pool DNA were carried out as described (23Gerald C. Walker M.W. Vaysse P.J-J. He C. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26758-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Forty-eight h after transfection, the galanin binding assay was carried out with 1 nm125I-porcine galanin (125I-pGAL; specific activity ∼2200 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) in 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, containing 1.26 mmCaCl2, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 5.4 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% bacitracin for 1 h at room temperature. Slides were examined for galanin binding as described previously (23Gerald C. Walker M.W. Vaysse P.J-J. He C. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26758-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Pools with positive cells were subdivided and rescreened until a single cDNA was isolated. Sequencing was carried out on both strands using Sequenase (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) according to the manufacturer protocols. Nucleotide and peptide sequence analyses were performed using the Wisconsin Package (GCG, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI). A Northern blot (Rat MTN Blot,CLONTECH) containing mRNA purified from various rat tissues was hybridized at high stringency according to the manufacturer specifications using a probe representing the full coding region of GALR2. The probe was labeled with 32P by random priming to a specific activity greater than 109 dpm/μg. The Northern blot was apposed to Kodak Biomax film with one Biomax intensifying screen for 4 days at −80 °C. The genomic Southern blot (Rat Genoblot, CLONTECH) was hybridized at high stringency using the same GALR2 probe and apposed to film for 6 days without intensifying screens. COS-7 cells were grown on 150-mm plates in DMEM supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum, 4 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Stock plates of COS-7 cells were trypsinized and split 1:6 every 3–4 days. Expression vectors containing GALR2 and GALR1 receptor cDNAs were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells by the DEAE-dextran method (24Warden D. Thorne H.V. J. Gen. Virol. 1968; 3: 371Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using 1 μg of DNA/106 cells. To create a cell line stably expressing the GALR2 receptor, an expression vector containing the GALR2 receptor cDNA was co-transfected with a G-418 resistance gene into CHO cells using the calcium phosphate transfection method (25Cullen B. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Transfected CHO cells were selected with G-418 and screened as membrane preparations for specific binding of 125I-pGAL. Membranes from transiently transfected COS-7 cells were prepared as described (26Wetzel J.M. Salon J.A. Tamm J.A. Forray C. Craig D. Nakanishi H. Cui W. Vaysse P.J.-J. Chiu G. Weinshank R.L. Hartig P.R. Branchek T.A. Gluchowski C. Recept. Chan. 1996; 4: 165-177PubMed Google Scholar) and suspended in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml phosphoramidon). In equilibrium saturation binding assays, membrane preparations were incubated with increasing concentrations (0.1–4 nm) of 125I-pGAL in a final volume of 0.25 ml. Nonspecific binding was determined with 10 μm unlabeled porcine galanin. The binding affinities of galanin analogs were determined in equilibrium competition binding assays using 0.3 nm125I-pGAL in the presence of 12 different concentrations of the displacing ligands. Binding reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 40 min, and the reaction was stopped by filtration through GF/B filters treated with 0.5% polyethyleneimine using a cell harvester. Radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting and data were analyzed using a computerized non-linear regression program (Prism, GraphPAD Software for Sci.). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar) with the Bio-Rad reagent using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Changes in phosphatidylinositol turnover were measured in intact cells as described previously (26Wetzel J.M. Salon J.A. Tamm J.A. Forray C. Craig D. Nakanishi H. Cui W. Vaysse P.J.-J. Chiu G. Weinshank R.L. Hartig P.R. Branchek T.A. Gluchowski C. Recept. Chan. 1996; 4: 165-177PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, intact CHO cells were incubated for 18 h in DMEM supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum and 5 μCi/ml [3H]d-myo-inositol (18.3 Ci/mmol). Prelabeled cells were incubated with porcine galanin or analogs in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm LiCl at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 60 min. The [3H]inositol phosphates produced by the cells were isolated by ion-exchange chromatography on Dowex 1-X8 (200–400 mesh). EC50 and maximum response values from concentration-response curves were estimated by fitting the data to a four-parameter logistic model using a computerized non-linear regression analysis program (Prism, GraphPAD Software for Sci.). To measure intracellular calcium levels, CHO cells stably expressing the GALR2 receptor were seeded into 35-mm plates with glass cover slip inserts. Intracellular free [Ca+2] was measured by microspectrofluorometry using Fura-2/AM as described previously (23Gerald C. Walker M.W. Vaysse P.J-J. He C. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26758-26761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were converted to [Ca+2] using a standard curve and reported as mean ± S.E. Female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus-1, Ann Arbor, MI) were anesthetized in 0.2% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester, and a portion of ovary was removed using aseptic technique (28Quick M.W. Lester H.A. Methods Neurosci. 1994; 19: 261-279Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Oocytes were defolliculated using 3 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) in a solution containing 87.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Oocytes were injected (Nanoject, Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) with 50 nl of rat GALR2 mRNA or other mRNA for use as a negative control. RNA was prepared by linearization of a plasmid containing the entire coding region of the GALR2 cDNA, followed byin vitro transcription using T7 polymerase (MessageMachine, Ambion, Austin, TX). Oocytes were incubated at 17 °C on a rotating platform for 3–8 days postinjection. Dual electrode voltage clamp (GeneClamp, Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) was performed using 3 m KCl-filled glass microelectrodes having resistances of 1–3 megohms. Unless otherwise specified, oocytes were clamped at a holding potential of −80 mV. During recordings, oocytes were bathed in continuously flowing (2–5 ml/min) medium containing 96 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.5 (ND96). Drugs were applied by switching from a series of gravity-fed perfusion lines. To clone additional members of the galanin receptor family, we used an expression cloning strategy based on the hypothesis that there were multiple galanin receptors present in hypothalamus (17Wynick D. Smith D.M. Ghatei M. Akinsanya K. Bhogal R. Purkiss P. Byfield P. Yanaihara N. Bloom S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4231-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 29Bartfai T. Langel Ü. Bedecs K. Andell S. Land T. Gregersen S. Ahren B. Girotti P. Consolo S. Corwin R. Crawley J. Xu X. Weisenfeld-Hallin Z. Hökfelt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 88: 11287-11291Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A randomly primed cDNA expression library was constructed from rat hypothalamus and screened in pools by radioligand binding/photoemulsion detection using 125I-pGAL. Slides were inspected for positive cells by direct microscopic examination. One positive pool, J126, was subdivided and rescreened until an individual cDNA clone was isolated (K985) that conferred galanin binding. The isolated GALR2 plasmid contained a 3.8-kb insert. Sequence analysis of this cDNA revealed a complete coding region for a receptor protein similar to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Searches of GenBankTM/EBI Data Banks indicated that the sequence was unique and that the most similar sequence was that of the galanin receptor GALR1. The nucleotide sequence of the coding region was 56% identical to rat GALR1 and encoded a 372 amino acid protein with 38% amino acid identity to rat GALR1. The deduced amino acid sequence of GALR2 compared with GALR1 is shown in Fig.1. Hydropathy plots of the predicted amino acid sequence reveal seven hydrophobic regions that may represent transmembrane domains (TMs; data not shown), typical of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. In the putative TM domains, GALR2 exhibits 48–49% amino acid identity with rat and human GALR1. Like most GPCRs, the GALR2 receptor contains consensus sequences forN-linked glycosylation in the N terminus (positions 2 and 11) and in the predicted extracellular loop between TMs IV and V. The GALR2 receptor also contains two highly conserved cysteine residues in the first two extracellular loops that are believed to form a disulfide bond stabilizing the functional protein structure (30Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The coding region of the GALR2 cDNA was interrupted by an intron of ∼1 kb; splicing of the intron recreated an open reading frame within a highly conserved region of the GPCR family, at the end of TMIII (LD(R/Y); see Fig. 1). The presence of an intron within the cDNA isolated from rat hypothalamus indicates that the mRNA from which the cDNA was reverse transcribed was incompletely spliced. It is of interest to note that several GPCRs have previously been reported to contain introns at this location, including the human dopamine D3, D4, and D5 receptors, the rat substance P receptor, and the human substance K receptor (30Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). In particular, the rat 5-HT7 receptor (31Shen Y. Monsma Jr., F.J. Metcalf M.A. Jose P.A. Hamblin M.W. Sibley D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18200-18204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,32Bard J.A. Zgombick J. Adham N. Vaysse P. Branchek T.A. Weinshank R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23422-23426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) contains an intron in the same location we now report for GALR2, within the A(G/G) codon for the highly conserved amino acid arginine at the end of TMIII. Recently, the cloning of a galanin receptor with the same predicted amino acid sequence was described by Howard et al. (22Howard A.D. Tan C. Shiao L.-L. Palyha O.C. McKee K.K. Weinberg D.H. Feighner S.D. Cascierie M.A. Smith R.G. Van Der Ploeg L.H.T. Sullivan K.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), who isolated both intron-containing and correctly spliced cDNAs. Interestingly, the nucleotide sequence of the 490-base pair intron reported by Howard et al. (22Howard A.D. Tan C. Shiao L.-L. Palyha O.C. McKee K.K. Weinberg D.H. Feighner S.D. Cascierie M.A. Smith R.G. Van Der Ploeg L.H.T. Sullivan K.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) is contained entirely within the ∼1-kb intron described here, suggesting that the intron itself can be alternatively or incompletely spliced. Northern blot analysis revealed a transcript of ∼1.8–2.0 kb after a 4-day exposure of the autoradiogram (Fig.2 A). The GALR2 transcript is widely but unevenly distributed: GALR2 mRNA was observed in brain, lung, heart, spleen, and kidney, with lighter bands in skeletal muscle, liver, and testis (Fig. 2 A). By reprobing the blot with 1B15 (Fig. 2 A) (33Danielson P.E. Forss-Petter S. Brow M.A. Calavetta L. Douglass J. Milner R.J. Sutcliffe J.G. DNA ( N. Y. ). 1988; 7: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) and β-actin (not shown), we confirmed that similar amounts of RNA were present in each sample. GALR2 transcripts containing the ∼1-kb intron in the coding region are undetectable by Northern blot but can be amplified by reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reaction (data not shown), suggesting that the proportion of unspliced mRNA in native tissues is low. Conversely, the intronless form of GALR2 is the predominant species amplified by reverse transcribed-polymerase chain reaction. The mismatch between the size of the GALR2 transcript (∼1.8–2.0 kb) and the isolated GALR2 cDNA (∼3.8 kb) suggests that the 5′-untranslated sequence in the cDNA may contain another intron. Hybridization of a rat genomic Southern blot at high stringency revealed band patterns consistent with the presence of a single copy of the GALR2 gene (Fig. 2 B). Multiple bands observed in BamHI and PstI lanes are predicted by the presence of these restriction enzyme sites within the ∼1-kb intron described above. The pharmacology of GALR2 was studied in COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the plasmid containing the GALR2 cDNA (K985). Membrane preparations of COS-7 cells transfected with K985 displayed specific and saturable binding to 125I-pGAL with aK d of 150 pm and aB max of 250 fmol/mg protein. Peptide analogs of galanin were used to generate a comparative pharmacological profile for GALR2 versus GALR1 receptors. As shown in TableI, both GALR1 and GALR2 receptors bound the full-length peptide porcine galanin-(1–29) with high affinity, as well as the truncated analogs galanin-(1–16) and galanin-(1–15). Both receptor subtypes also displayed high affinity for the putative galanin antagonists M15, M35, M40, and C7 (15Bartfai T. Bedecs K. Land T. Langel Ü. Bertorelli R. Girotti P. Consolo S. Yu Y.-J.

Lindskog S. Land T. Langel U. Bartfai T. Ahren B. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 232: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), all of which share a common galanin-(1–13) N terminus. Furthermore, binding affinity was lost for either receptor subtype when the first two N-terminal residues were deleted, as in the case of galanin-(3–29). A common feature of GALR1 and GALR2 therefore appears to be a preferential interaction with the N-terminal residues of the parent galanin peptide. While there were many similarities in the pharmacology profiles thus derived, GALR2 was readily distinguished from GALR1 by its high affinity for the modified peptide [d-Trp2]galanin-(1–29) (see TableI), demonstrating a greater tolerance of GALR2 for modifications in position two of galanin. [d-Trp2]galanin-(1–29) thus represents the first known peptide selective for GALR2 versus GALR1.Table IPharmacological profile of the cloned rat GALR2 receptor and comparison with the cloned rat GALR1 receptorPeptiderGALR1rGALR2K iK iEC50nmnmPorcine galanin-(1–29)0.5 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.118 ± 3Galanin-(1–15)3 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.0865 ± 9Galanin-(1–16)2 ± 0.052 ± 0.594 ± 12Porcine galanin-(3–29)>1,000>1,000>1,0001-an = 1.Galantide (M15)10 ± 22 ± 0.33001-an = 1.[D-Trp2]galanin-(1–29)>1,0007 ± 2150 ± 361-bn = 2.C-716 ± 0.419 ± 43 ± 2M320.6 ± 0.10.6 ± 0.0613 ± 4M350.3 ± 0.050.6 ± 0.129 ± 6M404 ± 0.70.7 ± 0.328 ± 8Binding data were determined from competitive displacement of125I-pGAL binding to membranes from COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the rat GALR2 or rat GALR1 receptor cDNA.

All the peptides tested elicited maximal responses within 10% of those measured for porcine galanin. Data are shown as EC50 mean ± S.E. (n ≥ 3 unless stated otherwise). To assess the functional coupling of GALR2, we examined the second-messenger pathways linked to receptor activation. In CHO cells stably transfected with the GALR2 receptor cDNA, porcine galanin-(1–29) stimulated the formation of [3H]inositol phosphates by 8-fold with an EC50 of 18 ± 3 nm (Table I). Galanin-(1–15), galanin-(1–16), and the putative antagonist peptides C7, M32, M35, and M40 were also found to be full agonists in the stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in CHO cells expressing the GALR2 receptor, as was [D-Trp2]galanin-(1–29); these chimeric peptides also behaved as agonists at the cloned rat GALR1 receptor (36Forray C. Smith K. Gerald C. Vaysse P. Weinshank R. Branchek T. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1996; 22: 1304Google Scholar). Comparison of K i and EC50 values for a given peptide (see Table I) suggests that 125I-pGAL binds selectively to a high affinity conformation of the GALR2 receptor in membrane preparations under these experimental conditions in which the concentration of 125I-pGAL concentration is low (0.3 nm). Consistent with this proposal, specific binding of125I-pGAL to the GALR2 receptor was significantly reduced by 100 μm Gpp(NH)p (data not shown). Conversely, the low affinity conformation of the GALR2 receptor expressed in intact cells may be the primary route by which galanin induces a functional response. Heterologous expression of GPCRs in Xenopus oocytes has been widely used to determine the identity of signaling pathways activated by receptor agonists (37Gundersen C.B. Miledi R. Parker I. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 219: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 38Takahashi T. Neher E. Sakmann B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5063-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We used the Xenopus oocyte system to further explore the functional coupling of GALR2 receptors. Application of porcine galanin (100–1000 nm) activated rapid inward currents in 36 of 46 oocytes injected with GALR2 mRNA (Fig. 3 A). Oocytes injected with buffer (ND96) alone did not exhibit detectable (<5 nA) responses to galanin (0 of 19 responded) nor did oocytes injected with GALR1 (0 of 20 responded). Current magnitudes in GALR2 mRNA-injected oocytes ranged from small fluctuations of less than 50 nA (excluded from analysis) to large, rapid currents (up to 3 μA) resembling those evoked by stimulation of other receptors (α1A receptors; data not shown) that are known to couple to IP3 release and activation of Cl− current from the resulting increase in intracellular free Ca2+ (38Takahashi T. Neher E. Sakmann B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5063-5067Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The currents stimulated by galanin in oocytes expressing GALR2 were most likely mediated by the endogenous calcium-activated Cl− channel (37Gundersen C.B. Miledi R. Parker I. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1983; 219: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) because they were blocked in oocytes injected with 50 nl of 10 mm EGTA (5 of 5 responded), and they displayed a current-voltage relation that exhibited outward rectification and a reversal potential of approximately −15 mV (data not shown). Consistent with these data, intracellular free [Ca+2] was also increased by 1 μm rat galanin in CHO cells stably transfected with GALR2 (Δ [Ca+2] = 310 ± 70 nm,n = 9) but not in untransfected cells (Fig.3 B). Increases in phosphatidylinositol release, chloride conductance, and calcium mobilization are all consistent with a primary signaling pathway for GALR2 receptors involving activation of phospholipase C via a Gq/G11-type mechanism. In this regard, the signal transduction pathway elucidated for the GALR2 receptor in this report differs from that described for the cloned GALR1 receptors, which couple to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase through members of the Gi family of G-proteins (19Habert-Ortoli E. Amiranoff B. Loquet I. Laburthe M. Mayaux J.-F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9780-9783Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 20Parker E.M. Izzarelli D. Nowak H. Mahle C. Iben L. Wang J. Goldstein M.E. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 34: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). To further evaluate this finding, we compared galanin-stimulated functional responses mediated by GALR1 and GALR2 in stably transfected CHO cells and the relative sensitivities of these responses to pertussis toxin (Fig.4). Galanin acting via GALR1 caused a reduction in cAMP levels in forskolin-treated cells but did not activate inositol phospholipid turnover. In contrast, galanin acting via GALR2 stimulated phosphatidylinositol turnover but did not decrease cAMP levels. Moreover, the phosphoinositide response in stably transfected CHO cells was insensitive to pertussis toxin under conditions in which the inhibition of adenylate cyclase was significantly reduced, supporting the conclusion that GALR2 is coupled to its effectors through a pathway independent of Gi/Go. Thus our functional data serve to distinguish GALR2 from GALR1 and also from the galanin receptors expressed in GH3 cells reported to couple to the inactivation of calcium channels (39Kalkbrenner F. Degtiar V.E. Schenker M. Brendel S. Zobel A. Heschler J. Wittig B. Schultz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4728-4737Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Our data are also in contrast with a preliminary report in which a galanin receptor with the same amino acid sequence was reported to mediate inhibition of adenylate cyclase in HEK-293 cells (40Ahmad S. Shen S.H. Walker P. Wahlestedt C. Abstracts 8th World Congress on Pain. IASP Press, Vancouver, BC, Canada1996: 134Google Scholar); we studied cAMP regulation in 293 cells stably transfected with rat GALR2 (estimatedB max ∼0.15 pmol/mg protein) and found no evidence for galanin-dependent inhibition of cAMP levels. Previous reports of galanin-stimulated phosphoinositide turnover were limited to studies in small cell lung carcinoma cell lines (41Sethi T. Rozengurt E. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1674-1679PubMed Google Scholar) and mudpuppy heart (42Hardwick J.C. Parsons R.L. J. Auton. Nerv. Syst. 1992; 40: 87-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar); recently, galanin-stimulated calcium mobilization was observed in RINm5F cells (43Ahren B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Within mammalian brain, however, galanin activation of phospholipase C has not been observed, while Gi/Go mechanisms are commonly reported (for review, see Ref. 5Kask K. Langel U. Bartfai T. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 15: 653-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Previous studies using [d-Trp2] analogues of galanin also failed to predict a [d-Trp2]-preferring receptor subtype within the brain. The existence of GALR2 was therefore not predicted by existing pharmacological tools. Within the family of neuropeptide receptors, the existence of two receptor subtypes (GALR1 and GALR2) with distinct primary signaling mechanisms is exceptional: the NPY, opioid, CCK, bradykinin, tachykinin, and somatostatin receptor families, as examples, all exhibit uniform coupling patterns among their respective subtypes. 2Trends in Pharmacological ScienceNomenclature Supplement (1996).In fact, GALR2 is the only receptor in the related opioid/somatostatin/galanin receptor group that does not readily signal through a Gi-type mechanism. In conclusion, we have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a galanin receptor from rat hypothalamus, termed GALR2, which exhibits pharmacological properties and a signaling pathway distinct from GALR1 receptors. The availability of the recombinant GALR2 receptor subtype should enable the design and development of selective agonists and antagonists that could be used as tools to study the physiological processes mediated by galanin receptors.

Ste5 also associates with Ste4, the β subunit of a heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide–binding protein, potentially linking receptor activation to stimulation of the MAPK cascade. A RING-H2 motif at the Ste5 amino terminus is apparently essential for function because Ste5(C177S) and Ste5(C177A C180A) mutants did not rescue the mating defect of a ste5Δ cell. In vitro Ste5(C177A C180A) bound each component of the MAPK cascade, but not Ste4. Unlike wild-type Ste5, the mutant did not appear to oligomerize; however, when fused to a heterologous dimerization domain (glutathione S-transferase), the chimeric protein restored mating in an ste5Δ cell and an ste4Δ ste5Δ double mutant. Thus, the RING-H2 domain mediates Ste4-Ste5 interaction, which is a prerequisite for Ste5-Ste5 self-association and signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2035450414,"We obtained two human cDNA clones encoding phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) isozymes named PAP-2a (M r = 32,158) and -2b (M r = 35, 119), both of which contained six putative transmembrane domains. Both enzymes were glycosylated and cleaved by N-glycanase and endo-β-galactosidase, thus suggesting their post-Golgi localization. PAP-2a and -2b shared 47% identical sequence and were judged to be the human counterparts of the previously sequenced mouse 35-kDa PAP(83% identity) and rat Dri42 protein (94% identity), respectively. Furthermore, the sequences of both PAPs were 34–39% identical to that of DrosophilaWunen protein. In view of the functions ascribed to Wunen and Dri42 in germ cell migration and epithelial differentiation, respectively, these findings unexpectedly suggest critical roles of PAP isoforms in cell growth and differentiation. Although the two PAPs hydrolyzed lysophosphatidate and ceramide-1-phosphate in addition to phosphatidate, the hydrolysis of sphingosine-1-phosphate was detected only for PAP-2b. PAP-2b was expressed almost ubiquitously in all human tissues examined, whereas the expression of PAP-2a was relatively variable, being extremely low in the placenta and thymus. In HeLa cells, the transcription of PAP-2a was not affected by different stimuli, whereas PAP-2b was induced (up to 3-fold) by epidermal growth factor. These findings indicate that despite structural similarities, the two PAP isozymes may play distinct functions through their different patterns of substrate utilization and transcriptional regulation.

Phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP) 1The abbreviations used are: PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphatase; DG, diacylglycerol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EGF, epidermal growth factor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: PAP, phosphatidic acid phosphatase; DG, diacylglycerol; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; EGF, epidermal growth factor; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; HA, influenza virus hemagglutinin; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bp, base pair(s). (EC 3.1.3.4) supplies diacylglycerol (DG) in glycerolipid biosynthesis by dephosphorylating phosphatidic acid (PA) (1Smith S.W. Weiss S.B. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 228: 915-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since both DG (2Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4207) Google Scholar) and PA (3Moolenaar W.H. Jalink K. Van Corven E.J. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 119: 47-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) are potent signaling molecules, PAP plays an important role in cellular signal transduction in addition to lipid biosynthesis (4Kanoh H. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In signaling systems mediated by phospholipase D (5Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), liberated PA is generally converted, albeit to different extents, to DG by the action of PAP (6Hii C.S.T. Edwards Y.S. Murray A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20238-20243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lavie Y. Piterman O. Liscovitch M. FEBS Lett. 1990; 277: 7-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Mullmann T.J. Siegel M.I. Egan R.W. Billah M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2013-2016Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thus suggesting that PAP contributes to the control of the relative balance of the two lipid second messengers. There exist two forms of mammalian PAP that can be distinguished with respect to subcellular localization and enzymologic properties (9Jamal Z. Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2988-2996Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). So far, distinct functions have been ascribed to the two forms of PAP. The type 1 PAP, a Mg2+-dependent andN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive enzyme, is considered to be primarily involved in lipid synthesis based on its translocation from the cytosol to microsomes upon stimulation of cellular triacylglycerol synthesis (10Gomez-Munoz A. Hamza E.H. Brindley D.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1127: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Aridor-Piterman O. Lavie Y. Liscovitch M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Gomez-Munoz A. Hatch G.M. Martin A. Jamal Z. Vance D.E. Brindley D.N. FEBS Lett. 1992; 301: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In this context, a recent work showed using a novel enzyme inhibitor that the type 1 PAP indeed participated in triacylglycerol synthesis in mouse macrophages (13Balsinde J. Dennis E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31937-31941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the type 2 PAP, a Mg2+-independent andN-ethylmaleimide-insensitive enzyme, has been postulated to participate in cellular signal transduction mediated by phospholipase D. The finding that the activities of the type 2 PAP and phospholipase D were decreased in a coordinate manner in transformed fibroblasts (14Martin A. Gomez-Munoz A. Waggoner D.W. Stone J.C. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23924-23932Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is consistent with the role of this isoform in signal transduction. However, such distinct functions ascribed to the PAP isoforms need to be further studied, since there are several reports describing the participation of the type 1 rather than the type 2 PAP in signal transduction occurring in, for example, polymorphonuclear leukocytes stimulated with inflammatory substances (15Truett A.P. Bocckino S.B. Murray J.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and EGF-stimulated A431 cells (16Jiang Y. Lu Z. Zang Q. Foster D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29529-29532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A novel aspect of the function of the type 2 PAP has recently been disclosed by its broad substrate specificity. The enzyme purified from rat liver could hydrolyze ceramide-1-phosphate and sphingosine-1-phosphate in addition to PA and lyso-PA (17Waggoner D.W. Gomez-Munoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Since ceramide, sphingosine, and their phosphorylated derivatives are known to serve as signaling molecules (18Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 20Spiegel S. Foster D. Kolesnick R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), the type 2 PAP can be involved in the metabolic processing of lipid mediators derived from both glycerolipids and sphingolipids. Furthermore, the type 2 PAP from rat liver has been described to be capable of hydrolyzing DG pyrophosphate (21Dillon D.A. Chen X. Zeimetz G.M. Wu W.-I. Waggoner D.W. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10361-10366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), a novel phospholipid with a potential signaling function at least in plants (22Munnik T. de Vrije T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15708-15715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Despite the apparent importance of PAP as noted above, relatively little has been known for the molecular structure of this enzyme. After several attempts of enzyme purification of the type 2 PAP (23Kanoh H. Imai S. Yamada K. Sakane F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25309-25314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fleming I.N. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Waggoner D.W.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), we have finally succeeded in the cDNA cloning of a mouse 35-kDa enzyme, which was confirmed to be the type 2 plasma membrane-bound PAP (27Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The cloned enzyme is a novel glycoprotein exhibiting a channel-like structure with six putative transmembrane domains. We soon noticed (28Kanoh, H., Kai, M., and Wada, I. (1997) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in pressGoogle Scholar) that the amino acid sequence of the mouse PAP is 34 and 48% identical to those of Drosophila Wunen protein (29Zhang N. Zhang J. Purcell K.J. Cheng Y. Howard K. Nature. 1997; 385: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and rat Dri42 protein (30Barila D. Plateroti M. Nobili F. Muda A.O. Xie Y. Morimoto T. Perozzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29928-29936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), respectively. The Wunen and Dri42 have been cloned as gene products involved in the regulation of germ cell migration (29Zhang N. Zhang J. Purcell K.J. Cheng Y. Howard K. Nature. 1997; 385: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and in epithelial differentiation (30Barila D. Plateroti M. Nobili F. Muda A.O. Xie Y. Morimoto T. Perozzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29928-29936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), respectively. However, it is not determined whether the Wunen and Dri42 possess the PAP catalytic activities. The rat Dri42 was described to reside in the endoplasmic reticulum (30Barila D. Plateroti M. Nobili F. Muda A.O. Xie Y. Morimoto T. Perozzi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29928-29936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), whereas the mouse 35-kDa PAP (with a closely related structure) was confirmed to localize in the plasma membranes (27Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the purification of the type 2 PAP yielded enzyme proteins with variable molecular sizes (24Fleming I.N. Yeaman S.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 983-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Waggoner D.W. Martin A. Dewald J. Gomez-Munoz A. Brindley D.N. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), thus suggesting the presence of multiple forms of the type 2 PAP. The systematic characterization of the type 2 PAP isozymes should help to understand the biological implications of this novel type of phosphatase. We thus attempted to clone the type 2 PAP isozymes. We have cloned two human PAP-2 isozymes designated 2a and 2b, which happened to be the human counterparts of the mouse 35-kDa PAP and rat Dri42, respectively. The two PAP isozymes showed distinct properties despite their structural similarities, suggesting their different functions. The sources of most of the materials have been described previously (23Kanoh H. Imai S. Yamada K. Sakane F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25309-25314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kai M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP and [α- 32P]dCTP were obtained from Amersham Corp., and [35S]methionine was from NEN Life Science Products. Sphingosine, long chain ceramide, sphingomyelin, dioleoylglycerol, monooleoylglycerol, and phospholipase D (type VI, fromStreptomyces chromofuscus) were obtained from Sigma. EGF was obtained from Collaborative Research. Escherichia coli DG kinase was obtained from Calbiochem, and the protein assay kit was from Pierce. N-Glycanase was obtained from New England Biolabs, and sialidase and endo-β-galactosidase were the products of Seikagaku (Tokyo, Japan). The rabbit anti-calnexin antibody has been described (32Wada I. Ou W.J. Liu M.C. Scheele G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7464-7472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., and anti-HA epitope tag antibody, 12CA5, was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Several cell lines, 293, HeLa, and HepG2, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (27Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 31Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radiolabeled PA, lyso-PA, and ceramide-1-phosphate were prepared by incubating dioleoylglycerol, monoolein, and ceramide, respectively, with [γ-32P]ATP and E. coli DG kinase (33Walsh J.P. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6239-6247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (23Kanoh H. Imai S. Yamada K. Sakane F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25309-25314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). [32P]Sphingosine-1-phosphate was prepared by acid hydrolysis of labeled ceramide-1-phosphate as described by Gomez-Munozet al.(34). The labeled lipids were purified by thin layer chromatography and quantitated by phosphate analysis and radioactivity determination. Nonlabeled ceramide-1-phosphate was prepared by phospholipase D treatment of sphingomyelin as described by Imamura and Horiuti (35Imamura S. Horiuti Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1979; 85: 79-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The specific radioactivities of the labeled substrates were 5,000–20,000 cpm/nmol, and the substrates were added as Triton X-100 mixed micelles. The phosphatase activities hydrolyzing different substrates were measured under the same conditions as described previously (23Kanoh H. Imai S. Yamada K. Sakane F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25309-25314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2 mm labeled lipids, 3.2 mm Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml), and enzyme. Except for incubation with sphingosine-1-phosphate, the reaction was continued for 5 min at 37 °C, and the liberation of water-soluble 32Pi was determined by liquid scintillation counting as described before (23Kanoh H. Imai S. Yamada K. Sakane F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25309-25314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The incubation with sphingosine-1-phosphate was continued for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped with 10 μl of concentrated formic acid as described by Waggoner et al.(17). In this case, the released32Pi was separated by thin layer chromatography (17Waggoner D.W. Gomez-Munoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). All reaction rates were proportional to the amounts of enzyme protein and incubation time and were usually done in triplicates, the results of which differed <5%. We initially searched GenBankTM data base for the human cDNA sequences encoding proteins homologous to the mouse PAP (27Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We found two representative cDNA fragments (accession numbers H68363 and N68923) encoding the partial C-terminal amino acid sequences, which were distinct from each other but similar to the corresponding regions of the mouse PAP. We presumed that these cDNAs represented the clones encoding PAP isozymes and tentatively designated the predicted proteins as PAP-2a and -2b. To obtain the cDNAs containing the complete coding regions for the putative PAP isozymes, we made use of the RACE-PCR method using Marathon cDNA amplification kit from CLONTECH. We first synthesized oligoprimers HPa0 and HPb0 based on the sequences unique to the PAP-2a (accession number H68363) and PAP-2b (accession numberN68923) cDNAs, respectively. Using these primers, the first-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA prepared from HepG2 cells as described previously (31Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first-strand cDNAs thus synthesized were subjected to the first round of RACE-PCR using other nested primers, each specific for PAP-2a and -2b (HPa1 and HPb1, respectively) following the manufacturer's protocol. The amplified fragments (922 bp for PAP-2a and 820 bp for PAP-2b) were gel-purified, subcloned into pBluescript IISK+ (Stratagene), and sequenced using ABI PRISM system (Perkin-Elmer). The next and final round of RACE-PCR amplification of the two cDNAs was then performed using specific primers (HPa2 and HPb2) synthesized on the basis of the determined nucleotide sequences. The RACE-PCR amplification described resulted in the sequencing of 937 and 1024 bp of cDNAs containing the complete coding regions for PAP-2a and PAP-2b, respectively. In the final experiments, we synthesized the sense-directed primers, HPa3 and HPb3, based on the 5′-most sequences of the cDNAs sequenced for PAP-2a and 2b as described above. The full-length cDNAs encoding PAP-2a and PAP-2b were then obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR from 2 μg of total HepG2 RNA using Superscript preamplification system (Life Technologies, Inc.). In this case amplification was done as described previously (31Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using the primer sets of HPa1-HPa3 and HPb1-HPb3 for PAP-2a and PAP-2b, respectively. The resultant PCR products were subcloned into pBluescript II SK at the EcoRV site, and the sequences of the two cDNAs were confirmed by sequencing five independent clones for each. DNA sequences were analyzed and aligned as described previously (27Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 36Sakane F. Imai S. Kai M. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol.

The PAP cDNAs were subcloned into pREP9 (Invitrogen) at theHindIII-BamHI site as described previously (27Kai M. Wada I. Imai S. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18931-18938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To express PAP isozymes as GFP-fusion proteins, two primers for each cDNA were synthesized for PCR amplification. In the case of PAP-2a, the sense primer, HPa-N, 5′-GGCAGCCCGGGCTAGCACCATGTTCGACAAGAC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 29–61) was designed to generate a NheI site (underlined). The antisense primer, HPa-C, 5′-GCACCCTGCTGCGTCGACAGGCTGGTGATTG-3′ (nucleotides 917- 887) was designed to introduce a SalI site and also to destroy the termination codon of PAP-2a (underlined). PCR amplification was performed as described previously (31Kai M. Sakane F. Imai S. Wada I. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18492-18498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the two primers and the PAP-2a cDNA in pBluescript as a template. The amplified fragment was digested with NheI andSalI and subcloned into the plasmid pEGFP-3N (CLONTECH) at the corresponding site. A similar strategy was adopted for the construction of the expression plasmid of PAP-2b-GFP fusion protein. In this case, the PCR mixture contained the sense primer, HPb-N (5′-CGATAAGCTTGCTAGCGCCATGCAAAAC-3′, corresponding to nucleotides 1–15 in the PAP-2b cDNA, restriction site and mutated nucleotides underlined), the antisense primer, HPb-C (5′-AGGAGGTGGGTGCTCGAGACATCATGTTGTG-3′, nucleotides 958–928), and the PAP-2b clone in pBluescript. The amplified fragment was digested with NheI and XhoI and subcloned into the corresponding site of the plasmid pEGFP-3N. The plasmids for expression of the two PAPs each with an HA epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) at the C terminus (PAP-HA) were prepared from the pEGFP-3N expression vectors constructed as described above. For this purpose, we prepared an adaptor coding for a HA tag as follows. The two oligonucleotides, 5′-TCGAGTATCCATATGATGTTCCAGATTATGCTCTCGACGCGCGGGCC-3′ and 5′-CGCGCGTCGAGAGCATAATCTGGAACATCATATGGATAC-3′ at 50 μm each were dissolved in the annealing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmMgCl2, and 100 mm NaCl. The mixture was heated at 90 °C for 2 min and cooled slowly to 50 °C at the rate of 1 °C/min. The annealed adaptor was inserted into the PAP-2a"

As part of an ongoing study of the molecular mechanisms of fibrosis, we have investigated the transcriptional regulation of the α2(I) collagen gene by OSM in human fibroblasts. An OSM response element was mapped by deletional analysis between base pairs (bp) −148 and −108 in the α2(I) collagen promoter. Further functional analysis of the α2(I) collagen promoter containing various substitution mutations revealed that both the basal activity and OSM stimulation of this promoter are mediated by a TCCTCC motif located between bp −128 and −123. Furthermore, three copies of the 12-bp synthetic α2(I) collagen promoter fragment containing the “TCC” motif conferred OSM inducibility to the otherwise unresponsive thymidine kinase promoter. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that the TCCTCC motif constitutes a novel binding site for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. No differences have been observed in in vitro gel shift binding assays between unstimulated and OSM-stimulated fibroblasts. However, subtle conformational changes were detected in the region of the promoter surrounding TCC repeats after OSM stimulation using in vivofootprint analysis. In conclusion, this study characterized a dual-function response element that mediates the basal activity and OSM stimulation of the human α2(I) collagen promoter.

Type I collagen, the most abundant mammalian collagen, consists of two α1(I) chains and one α2(I) chain that are coordinately expressed (1Ramirez F. Di Liberto M.

Excessive deposition of type I collagen, characteristic of many fibrotic disorders (4Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar), most likely results from transcriptional activation of collagen genes in response to cytokines and other factors present in prefibrotic/inflammatory lesions. The most widely studied cytokine involved in collagen deposition is TGF-β 1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; IL, interleukin; OSM, oncostatin M; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; bp, base pair(s); TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.1The abbreviations used are: TGF-β, transforming growth factor-β; IL, interleukin; OSM, oncostatin M; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; bp, base pair(s); TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α.; nonetheless, other cytokines such as IL-4, IL-1, or OSM share many biological effects of TGF-β including stimulation of collagen synthesis and may play important roles in extracellular matrix accumulation during fibrotic process, especially immune-mediated fibrosis (5Postlethwaite A.E.

Immunol. 1987; 139: 2977-2983PubMed Google Scholar) and monocytes (9Bruce A.G. Linsley P.S. Rose T.M. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 157-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and belongs to a subfamily of hematopoietic cytokines that also includes IL-6, IL-11, LIF (leukemia inhibitoryfactor), and CNTF (ciliaryneurotrophic factor). Members of this family bind receptor complexes containing a signal-transducing subunit termed gp130 (10Hirano T. Matsuda T. Nakajima K. Stem Cells. 1994; 12: 262-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11Rose T.M. Bruce A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1994; 179: 1337-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Interestingly, OSM utilizes a dual-receptor system (13Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). First, a heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of gp130 and LIF receptor-β can be used by both OSM and LIF. A second heterodimeric receptor complex consisting of gp130 and OSM receptor-β is activated by OSM only. As a result, some of the biological effects are shared by OSM and LIF, whereas others are OSM-specific. In fibroblasts, OSM stimulates both collagen and glycosaminoglycan production (7Duncan M.R. Hasan A. Berman B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 128-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Moreover, OSM has been reported to stimulate the synthesis of TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor ofmetalloproteinases) and plasminogen activator (14Richards C.D. Shoyab M. Brown T.J. Gauldie J. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5596-5603PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hamilton J.A. Leizer T. Piccoli D.S. Royston K.M. Butler D.M. Croatto M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 180: 652-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). OSM is a mitogen for murine NIH 3T3 cells and human foreskin and synovial fibroblasts (9Bruce A.G. Linsley P.S. Rose T.M. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 157-170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recent studies with transgenic mice overexpressing OSM in a tissue-specific manner demonstrated its pleiotropic nature in vivo and its association with visceral fibrosis (16Malik N. Haugen H.S. Modrell B. Shoyab M. Clegg C.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2349-2358Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Our laboratory is involved in studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of expression of the human α2(I) collagen gene in healthy and fibrotic human fibroblasts (17Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C.

Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The mechanism of modulation of type I collagen by OSM is of special interest because of a previous report that indicated a differential response of systemic sclerosis scleroderma and healthy skin fibroblasts to OSM. Unlike healthy skin fibroblasts, fibroblasts isolated from scleroderma lesions fail to respond to the stimulatory effect of OSM with regard to collagen and glycosaminoglycan synthesis (7Duncan M.R. Hasan A. Berman B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 128-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated the mechanism of the α2(I) collagen stimulation by OSM in healthy dermal fibroblasts. We show that OSM stimulates α2(I) collagen gene transcription through a constitutive positivecis-response element in the collagen promoter. We also characterize transcription factors interacting with this promoter element: two members of the Sp family of transcription factors, Sp1 and Sp3. Human dermal fibroblasts derived from a 2-month-old child (GMO5756A) were obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ) and propagated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Human foreskin fibroblasts were obtained from foreskins of healthy newborns (following institutional approval and informed consent). Primary explant cultures were established in 25-cm2 culture flasks in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 2 mml-glutamine, and 50 μg/ml amphotericin. Fibroblast cultures independently isolated from different individuals were maintained as monolayers at 37 °C in 10% CO2 in air and studied between the third and sixth subpassages. Both fibroblast types produced similar results in all assays. Fibroblasts were grown to confluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and then incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium (DMEM plus 0.1% BSA) before addition of cytokines and/or actinomycin D. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by Northern blotting as described previously (20Yamakage A. Kikuchi K. Smith E.A. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Filters were sequentially hybridized with radioactive probes for α2(I) procollagen and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The filters were scanned with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The deletion and substitution mutant plasmids (with the exception of the −148 end point deletion construct) have been previously described (17Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 18Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The −148 α2(I) collagen promoter deletion construct was generated using polymerase chain reaction technology. Plasmids used in transient transfection assays were twice purified on CsCl gradients. At least two different plasmid preparations were used for each experiment. Human fibroblasts were grown to 90% confluence in 100-mm dishes in DMEM with 10% FCS. Monolayers were washed, and cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate technique (17Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) with 20 μg of various deletion or mutant promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase constructs. pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega) was cotransfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. After incubation overnight, the medium was replaced with DMEM and 0.1% BSA containing 5 ng/ml OSM, and incubation was continued for 48 h. Cells were harvested in 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 8) and fractured by freeze-thawing. Extracts, normalized for protein content as measured by Bio-Rad reagents, were incubated with butyryl-CoA. [14C]Chloramphenicol was extracted using an organic solvent (2:1 mixture of tetramethylpentadecane and xylene) and quantified by scintillation counting. Each experiment was performed in duplicate. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine statistical significance. For the preparation of nuclear extracts from untreated and OSM-treated fibroblasts, cells were placed in DMEM and 0.1% BSA for 24 h prior to OSM treatment. After incubation with 5 ng/ml OSM for the indicated length of time, cells were harvested. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Andrews and Faller (21Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, confluent cells from five 150-mm dishes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of cold buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9) at 4 °C, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were allowed to swell on ice for 10 min and then vortexed for 10 s. The tube was centrifuged for 2 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 80 μl of cold buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and incubated on ice for 20 min for high-salt extraction. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation for 2 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was stored at −80 °C until use. The protein concentration of the extracts was determined using the Bio-Rad reagent. In some experiments (e.g. OSM stimulation; see Fig. 5), nuclear extracts contained 1 mm sodium orthovanadate to ensure the phosphorylated status of STAT proteins. Addition of sodium orthovanadate had no noticeable effect on protein binding to the α2(I) collagen promoter probe used in this study. Oligonucleotides used as probes, competitors, or polymerase chain reaction primers were synthesized using the Applied Biosystems nucleic acid synthesizer and were purchased from the Medical University of South Carolina Core Facility, except for the Oct-1 and NF1 consensus oligonucleotides, which were purchased from Promega. Radioactive probes for electrophoretic mobility shift assay were generated by [γ-32P]ATP end labeling. DNA mobility shift assay was performed as described previously (17Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, the binding reaction was performed on ice for 30 min in binding buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmMgCl2, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.7 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin) containing 50,000 cpm labeled probe, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and nuclear extracts containing 5 μg of protein. In some assays, double-stranded competitors (200-fold molar excess) or antibodies (2 μg) (purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added. Separation of free radiolabeled DNA from DNA-protein complexes was carried out on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out in 0.5 × Tris borate electrophoresis buffer at 200 V at 4 °C. Human fibroblasts were grown to confluence in DMEM and 10% FCS and then incubated in DMEM and 0.1% BSA for 24 h. OSM (5 ng/ml) was added, and the culture was incubated for periods ranging from 30 min to 4 h. The medium was then replaced with DMEM and 0.1% BSA containing 0.1% dimethyl sulfate (DMS) and incubated for 2 min. Cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C, lysed on the plates using 1.5 ml of lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 200 μg/ml proteinase K, and 0.2% SDS), and after scraping, incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. DNA was extracted twice with phenol, twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), once with a mixture of chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (24:1), and once with ether. DNA was precipitated once each with isopropyl alcohol and ethanol and resuspended in TE buffer (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA). DNA for thein vitro DMS treatment (naked) was prepared identically, with the omission of DMS treatment. For the in vitro DMS treatment, 25 μl of 1% DMS was added to 175 μl of DNA (100 μg), and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 2 min, followed by addition of 50 μl of ice-cold DMS stop buffer (1.5 msodium acetate (pH 7.0), 1 m β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA). Stop buffer was also added to 200 μl of DNA from the in vivo DMS treatment, and both DNA samples were precipitated with ethanol. The pellets were dissolved in 200 μl of 1m piperidine and incubated at 90 °C for 30 min. Piperidine was removed by lyophilization, and DNA samples were resuspended in TE buffer, precipitated with isopropyl alcohol and ethanol, and washed with 75% ethanol. The DNA was dissolved, and the concentration was adjusted to 0.4 μg/μl. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction was then used to detect DNA-protein interactions according to Mueller and Wold (22Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were purified using denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis. Two oligonucleotides for staggered linker have been described (22Mueller P.R. Wold B. Science. 1989; 246: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The following oligonucleotides were used to detect DNA-protein interactions on the coding strand of the human α2(I) collagen promoter: primer 1, GACTCCTTGTGTCGCAGAGC; primer 2, ACCTCCAACTTAGCCGAAACCT; and primer 3, ACCTCCAACTTAGCCGAAACCTCCTGC. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction annealing temperatures were 59 °C for primer 1, 58 °C for primer 2, and 60 °C for primer 3. To detect DNA-protein interactions on the noncoding strand, the oligonucleotides used were as follows: primer 4, CATGTCGGGGCTGCAGAGCACTCC; primer 5, TGCAGAGCACTCCGACGTGT; and primer 6, TGCAGAGCACTCCGACGTGTCCCA. Ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction annealing temperatures were 60 °C for primer 4, 63 °C for primer 5, and 66 °C for primer 6. The effect of OSM on α2(I) procollagen mRNA levels was investigated in confluent cultures of dermal fibroblasts. OSM induced dose-dependent (1–25 ng/ml) increases in α2(I) procollagen mRNA levels, with maximum stimulation observed at 5 ng/ml (Fig. 1,A and B). The potency of OSM was comparable to that of TGF-β under similar culture conditions (Fig. 1, Aand B). We next examined the time course of OSM effects on α2(I) procollagen mRNA expression levels. Stimulation by OSM could be detected after 6 h, and maximum induction occurred after 12 h (Fig. 1 C). Similar to the effect of TGF-β (23Ishikawa O. Yamakage A. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 169: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), OSM stimulation of collagen mRNA persisted for at least 48 h. To establish whether the increase in α2(I) mRNA levels after OSM treatment involves transcriptional activation, we tested the magnitude of OSM induction in fibroblasts treated with OSM for 12 h in the presence or absence of actinomycin D, which completely blocked the OSM-mediated increase in α2(I) procollagen mRNA levels (Fig.1 D), indicating that OSM stimulation of collagen mRNA is not mediated via increased transcript stability, but rather involves direct activation of transcription of the α2(I) procollagen gene and/or other genes involved in collagen gene regulation. To further analyze the transcriptional regulation of the collagen gene by OSM, we tested a series of 5′-deletions of the human α2(I) collagen promoter linked to the the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter gene in transient transfection assays (Fig. 2). OSM stimulation resulted in an ∼3-fold induction of promoter activity. Deletions to bp −148 did not significantly alter the level of inducibility, but further deletion to bp −108 abolished OSM stimulation. In agreement with previous data, deletion of the Sp1-binding sites (three GC boxes) between bp −353 and −264 significantly decreased basal promoter activity (17Tamaki T. Ohnishi K. Hartl C. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4299-4304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Subsequent deletion to bp −186 had no additional effect on basal promoter activity, whereas deletion to bp −148 increased basal promoter activity ∼2-fold compared with the deletion to −186. These data further corroborate the location of the previously mapped repressor site between bp −164 and −159 (18Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Subsequent deletion to bp −108 caused a decrease in promoter activity to ∼10% of the activity of the wild-type promoter. This dramatic effect on basal promoter activity most likely results from the removal of the previously identified positive constitutive cis-element containing a TCCTCC motif located between bp −128 and −123 in this promoter region (18Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Since deleting the −148 to −108 promoter fragment also abolished the OSM response, we tested whether the same response element mediates the basal activity and OSM stimulation of collagen promoter activity using previously generated substitution mutants in the TCCTCC motif. As shown in Fig. 3, collagen promoter constructs carrying substitution mutations in this cis-regulatory element were unresponsive to OSM stimulation. On the other hand, stimulation of collagen promoter activity by TGF-β was not affected by the mutations in the TCCTCC motif, consistent with previous observations that other response elements in the collagen promoter mediate TGF-β stimulation (25Truter S.

Furthermore, none of the substitution mutations in other response elements previously identified in this promoter affected OSM stimulation (Fig. 3).Figure 3TCCTCC motif mediates OSM stimulation of the human α2(I) collagen promoter.

Thetk promoter alone was not stimulated by OSM, whereas insertion of the “TCC” oligonucleotides consistently resulted in modest (2-fold) stimulation of the chimeric constructs independent of orientation (Table I). Interestingly, insertion of the TCC-containing oligonucleotide in the correct orientation did not affect tk promoter activity, but insertion in the opposite orientation decreased significantly the basal promoter activity of the construct. It is possible that, in reverse orientation, binding of the nuclear proteins to the TCC motif causes unfavorable conformational changes that negatively affect the activity of the tk promoter. A similar phenomenon has been observed with other heterologous promoter systems (24Rossi P. Karsenty G. Roberts A.B. Roche N.S. Sporn M.B. de Crombrugghe B.

Our previous analyses of the α2(I) collagen promoter indicated the presence of three specific DNA-protein complexes formed with the promoter fragment from bp −135 to −116 and nuclear extract from human dermal fibroblasts (18Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To further characterize the nature of the nuclear proteins interacting with this promoter region, we performed gel shift analyses with a series of competitor oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig.4 A (lane 2), six DNA-protein complexes were formed. Complexes 1–4 and 6 were competed off with an excess of either unlabeled probe (lane 3) or the Sp1 oligonucleotide (lane 4). This suggests that complexes 1–4 and 6 are specific and that proteins with binding specificities similar to that of Sp1 are involved in formation of these DNA-protein complexes. However, complex 4 was also competed off with an excess of NF1, Oct1, and SIE (a s is-inducibleelement present in the c-fos promoter known to bind STAT1 and STAT3 (26Ruff-Jamison S. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Chen K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21933-21935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Korzus E. Nagase H. Rydell R. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1188-1196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)) oligonucleotides (lanes 5–7). Moreover, this complex appeared variably with the nuclear extract preparations (e.g. compare Fig. 5 in Ref. 18), suggesting that this complex may represent nonspecific binding of the proteins to this promoter region. The nature of the protein(s) involved in formation of complex 6 is presently unknown. We have previously shown that DNA sequences involved in binding of the nuclear factors to this promoter region correspond to the TCCTCC motif located between bp −128 and −123 (see Fig. 5 in Ref. 18). To test directly whether the TCCTCC motif is involved in formation of the observed DNA-protein complexes, we performed gel shift analysis with an oligonucleotide probe containing a substitution mutation in the TCCTCC motif (18Ihn H. Ohnishi K. Tamaki T. LeRoy E.C. Trojanowska M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26717-26723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Complexes 1–3 were not formed with this mutant probe (lane 8). This result provides additional evidence that the TCCTCC motif is responsible for binding of the nuclear proteins to this promoter region. To further characterize the nature of the nuclear proteins interacting with this motif, we employed antibodies against four members of the Sp family (Sp1, Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4). As shown in Fig. 4 B, addition of the anti-Sp1 antibody caused a supershift of complex 1 (lane 3), whereas addition of the anti-Sp3 antibody abolished formation of complex 3, with the appearance of a weak supershifted band (lane 5). Simultaneous addition of the anti-Sp1 and anti-Sp3 antibodies abolished formation of complexes 1–3 (lane 7). Addition of the anti-Sp2 and anti-Sp4 antibodies did not affect formation of the DNA-protein complexes (lanes 4and 6), suggesting that Sp2 and Sp4 do not bind to this promoter region. Addition of the anti-STAT1 and anti-STAT3 antibodies did not affect formation of the DNA-protein complexes (lanes 8and 9). In conclusion, the data obtained by gel shift analyses are consistent with the notion that two members of the Sp family of proteins, Sp1 and Sp3, interact with the TCCTCC motif in the α2(I) collagen promoter. Thus, the TCCTCC motif represents a novel binding site for Sp1 and Sp3. To determine whether DNA-protein interactions in this region are regulated by OSM, we performed DNA mobility shift assays using the promoter fragment from bp −135 to −116 and nuclear extracts from human fibroblasts treated with OSM for different intervals (15 min to 8 h). As shown in Fig.5, no changes in the DNA-protein complexes were observed. Furthermore, OSM stimulation did not affect protein binding to the other regions of the collagen promoter: a −235 to −34 collagen"

The structure of the Na-K-Cl cotransporter transport protein is not known, but from analysis of the primary amino acid sequence and biochemical studies, it has been inferred that the protein has large cytoplasmic N and C termini and a hydrophobic central domain containing 12 transmembrane helices. Both the central domain and the C-terminal domain are highly conserved within the cation-chloride cotransporter family. This paper examines the role of these three domains in interacting with the transported ions and with the inhibitor bumetanide. We have used a chimera approach, exploiting the functional differences between the structurally similar shark and human secretory Na-K-Cl cotransporters (sNKCC1 and hNKCC1). These transporters are 74% identical to one another and have similar transport and regulatory behaviors; however, sNKCC1 differs markedly from hNKCC1 with regard to apparent affinities for the cotransported ions and for bumetanide. We prepared six sNKCC1-hNKCC1 chimeras in which N and C termini were interchanged between species. When transfected in HEK-293 cells, each chimera carried out bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb influx, demonstrating transporter synthesis and cell surface delivery. Monoclonal antibodies J3 and J7 were used to detect the chimeric proteins, and the epitopes for these antibodies were localized to residues 49–196 and 1050–1168, respectively, in the shark sequence. For each of two chimeras that were examined, the time course of activation in low Cl− medium was the same as for the parent proteins; activation was found to proceed through a change inV max rather than K m. For the six chimeras, the apparent affinities for Na+, K+, Cl−, and bumetanide segregated exactly according to whether the large hydrophobic central domain was derived from sNKCC1 or hNKCC1. Significantly, the well-conserved C terminus does not appear to contain residues involved in the shark-human affinity differences. These results demonstrate that residues involved with ion translocation and inhibitor binding are within the large central domain that contains the 12 predicted transmembrane helices.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16245-16252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). Translocation by the Na-K-Cl cotransporter requires the simultaneous binding of Na+, K+, and Cl−, and the apparent affinity for each ion depends on the concentration of the other cotransported ions (1Haas M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 443-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 11Hegde R.S. Palfrey H.C. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 126: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The binding of the specific inhibitor bumetanide is also dependent on the simultaneous presence of Na+, K+, and Cl− in the medium (1Haas M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 443-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made for binding of furosemide to K-Cl cotransporter (12Lauf P.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1984; 77: 57-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Hydropathy analysis of the NKCC sequence delineates three broad regions as follows: large N and C termini and a ∼500-residue central domain that is predicted to contain 12 transmembrane helices. Sites of regulatory phosphorylation have been identified in the N and C termini, demonstrating that at least parts of these domains are intracellular (2Xu J. Lytle C. Zhu T.T. Payne J.A. Benz Jr., E. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 13Lytle C. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25438-25443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the N terminus, only a small region encompassing the phosphorylation site is well conserved. In contrast, the C terminus is very well conserved among species and isoforms, with homology extending from cyanobacterium to man (14Gillen C.M. Stirewalt V.L. Bryant D.A. Forbush B. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 204Google Scholar, 15Payne J.A. Forbush III, B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 493-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Candidate sites forN-linked glycosylation are found in a large loop between the 7th and 8th predicted transmembrane helices, and mutagenesis experiments confirm the glycosylation of these sites, showing that the loop is extracellular (16Forbush III, B. Payne J.A. Xu J.C. Biemesderfer D. Isenring P. Abstracts of the International Society of Nephrology. American Physiological Society, Bethesda, MD1995Google Scholar). These features are summarized in the models shown in Fig. 1. Ion translocation must be mediated by amino acid residues within the plane of the lipid bilayer. In the simplistic model presented in Fig.1, such residues are depicted to lie within the 12 predicted transmembrane helices. However, several short hydrophobic regions in the large C-terminal domain (2Xu J. Lytle C. Zhu T.T. Payne J.A. Benz Jr., E. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) introduce the possibility that segments of the C terminus may be embedded in the bilayer as β strand (17Fischbarg J. Cheung M. Li J. Iserovich P. Czegledy F. Kuang K. Garner M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or as short peptide loops (18MacKinnon R. Neuron. 1995; 14: 889-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the extensive sequence conservation within the C terminus suggests an important functional role for this domain. Therefore, it is particularly important to test the model of Fig. 1 by determining experimentally which residues are involved in ion translocation. To date, there has been no structure-function analysis of any of the cation-chloride cotransporters beyond the identification of phosphorylated residues involved in transport activation. For other transporters, mutational analysis has generally supported the hypothesis that residues in predicted transmembrane helices mediate solute translocation, whereas hydrophilic domains may be important through allosteric interactions. For instance, Noël and Pouysségur (20Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showed that the Na+-H exchanger is able to carry out antiport activity without its N- or C-terminal hydrophilic domains (19Collins J.F. Honda T. Knobel S. Bulus N.M. Conary J. DuBois R. Ghishan F.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), but that the N-terminal domain is necessary for allosteric activation by intracellular acidification (20Noel J. Pouyssegur J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C283-C296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, mutants of the Na-Ca exchanger that lack the large cytosolic domain between helix 6 and 7 are no longer regulated by free Ca2+ but retain transport activity (21Matsuoka S. Nicoll D.A. Reilly R.F. Hilgemann D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3870-3874Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). However, in some cases, allosteric interactions may be manifested as changes in ion affinity, as illustrated by the finding that modification of the cytoplasmic domain of the Na pump (22Shainskaya A. Karlish S.J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10309-10316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) results in changes in affinity for translocated K+. Here we report the use of chimeras to explore the roles of the N terminus, C terminus, and transmembrane domain in ion and bumetanide binding by NKCC1. The analysis of chimeras between similar forms of a membrane protein is a powerful strategy to determine the role of the large structural domains. The exchange of regions between evolutionarily related carriers results in many conservative amino acid substitutions and is a rapid method to define important functional regions. As an alternative to selection of individual point mutations or deletion analysis, chimeras offer the advantage of determining the role of intact domains and limiting disruption in protein folding. In this study we have begun to localize regions of NKCC1 responsible for ion and bumetanide binding, taking advantage of the fact that although the shark and human transporters are 74% identical, theK m for Na+, K+, and Cl− and the K i for bumetanide are 4–6-fold higher in sNKCC1 compared with hNKCC1 (6Payne J.A. Xu J.C. Haas M. Lytle C.Y. Ward D. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17977-17985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Functional analysis of these chimeras demonstrates that it is the central segment containing the transmembrane helices that specifies the kinetic characteristics of the NKCC proteins and that the cytoplasmic N and C termini have little if any role in determining the species differences in ion and inhibitor binding. A preliminary report has been presented (23Isenring P. Forbush B. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7: 1282Google Scholar). The sNKCC1 and the hNKCC1 cDNAs, originally in the vector Bluescript SK-, were transferred to the mammalian expression vector pJB20 asKpnI-XhoI fragments. Subcloning in pJB20 required the addition of a second KpnI restriction site in the 5′ linker of sNKCC1/Bluescript SK- and hNKCC1/Bluescript SK- and of a newXhoI site in the 3′ linker of the vector pJB20; mutations in the linkers were created by inserting pairs of complementary synthetic oligonucleotides containing the appropriate restriction sites. The oligonucleotides containing the KpnI and XhoI sites were CTAGATATCGGTACCGCTAGCT and CGCGTCCTAGGATCGATCTCGAGA, respectively. pJB20 (24Beck P.J. Orlean P. Albright C. Robbins P.W. Gething M.J.

Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) and contains intronic sequences at the 3′ end of the linker to improve transcript stability; transcription of the insert is under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, and selection of transfectants is achieved through geneticin (G418) resistance. In our nomenclature, single letters (s, h) are used to designate segments from the shark and the human NKCC1 (Fig. 1), and a number (x.x) indicates the location of the chimeric junctions relative to the 12 putative transmembrane domains (0. indicates the N terminus, 1. to 12. indicate transmembrane regions, and 13. indicates the C terminus; each domain is roughly divided in 10 subdomains from 0 to 9). For example, sh0.9 represents a chimera with a shark N terminus and the remainder comprised of human sequence; the junction lies at the end of the N terminus near the transmembrane domain. The two junction points utilized in this study are at 0.9 (at His247/Val248 in sNKCC1 and Tyr275/Thr276 in hNKCC1) and 13.1 (at His756/Val757 in sNKCC1 and His783/Val784 in hNKCC1). sNKCC1/hNKCC1 chimeras were generated directly in pJB20 by fragment exchange at common restriction sites. For this purpose we used a uniqueKpnI site in the 5′ linker of both constructs and a uniquePmlI site in a conserved region of the C terminus, 25 amino acids after the last transmembrane domain (bp 2703 of sNKCC1 and 2511 of hNKCC1). In the N terminus, a convenient Bst1107I site is unique in hNKCC1/pJB20 (bp 986), at a position encoding the 15th amino acid before the first transmembrane domain. A correspondingBst1107I site was created silently at bp 1175 in sNKCC1, and a preexisting Bst1107I site at bp 4245 was removed using the Kunkel method (26Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar) as follows: sNKCC1 was subcloned in the phagemid pTZ18U (Bio-Rad) to generate uracil-containing single-stranded DNA. Two separate mutagenic synthetic oligonucleotides (+Bst1107I and −Bst1107I) overlapping base pairs 1175 and 4245 were hybridized to the template simultaneously and extended with T7 polymerase. The two mutations were reintroduced in sNKCC1/pJB20 by fragment exchange to generate a full-length construct sNKCC1bst/pJB20. Chimeras sh0.9 and hs0.9 were generated by ligating the appropriateKpnI-Bst1107I fragments from sNKCC1bst/pJB20 and hNKCC1/pJB20, and for hs13.1 and sh13.1, the KpnI-PmlI fragments of sNKCC1/pJB20 and hNKCC1/pJB20 were used. shs0.9/13.1 was generated by ligating the KpnI-PmlI fragments of sh0.9 and sNKCC1/pJB20; hsh0.9/13.1 was created by ligating theKpnI-PmlI fragments of hs0.9 and hNKCC1/pJB20. The deletion mutant sNKCC1del:50–216/pJB20 was generated by cutting sNKCC1/pJB20 at the unique restriction sitesBsteII and Bpu1102I that flank a region of sNKCC1 corresponding to residues 50–216 of the N terminus. After complete digestion, the 5′ recess ends were filled with the Klenow fragment in restriction digest buffer supplemented with 33 μm dNTPs. The larger fragment containing the vector, the UTRs, residues 1–49, and residues 217 to the stop codon was gel-purified and blunt-end ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The truncation mutant sNKCC1trunc:1004–1191/pJB20 was generated by cutting sNKCC1/Bluescript SK− at the unique restriction site aatII. The 3′ recess ends were removed using the Klenow fragment in restriction digest buffer supplemented with 33 μm dNTPs. The unique fragment was gel-purified and blunt-end ligated. The resulting construct contains 9 missense residues from 1004 to 1012 (AGGFSMTEV) before the new stop codon; aPml-XhoI fragment of this construct was moved into corresponding sites in sNKCC1/pJB20 for expression. All constructs were analyzed by automated sequencing or restriction analysis. The function of the proteins encoded by the wild-type cDNAs and the six chimeras were examined by isolating stable transfected HEK-293 cell lines. HEK-293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml) in a humidified incubator (5% CO2 at 37 °C). Nearly confluent cells were split 1:5 in a 10-cm dish the day before transfection. At 50–70% confluence, HEK-293 were transfected with 40 μg of cDNA by calcium phosphate precipitation (140 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 125 mmCaCl2, pH 7.1). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were selected for G418 resistance (950 μg/ml) over a 3-week period. Individual well-separated colonies (generally 12–16) were then isolated, amplified, and screened by 86Rb influx assays and Western blotting; among these, more than half usually had similar levels of expression as measured by 86Rb influx, and one of these was selected to be maintained for this study. All cell lines were found to maintain their flux characteristics when maintained in culture for periods up to 18 months and grew at about same rate. hs13.1-transfected cells exhibited a greater tendency than other cell lines to lift off of the plate during the flux assays. Experiments were performed as described previously (27Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Haas M. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25428-25437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK-293 cells were allowed to grow to near confluence and solubilized in 3% CHAPS with protease inhibitors. Whole cell lysates were assayed for protein content by the Micro BCA method (Pierce). Western blots (2–5-μg protein samples) were carried out using the sNKCC1 monoclonal antibodies J3 or J7 as described previously (27Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Haas M. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25428-25437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEK-293 cells were plated on poly-d-lysine pre-coated coverslips and grown to 50–60% confluence. They were then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100, and incubated 2 h at room temperature with J3 diluted to 5 μg/ml in blocking buffer. The coverslips were reincubated 1 h with goat anti-mouse IgG-conjugated with rhodamine at a 10 μg/ml dilution and mounted on glass slides with aquamount (Learner, Inc.). Micrographs were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope using Tmax-400 black and white film (Kodak). HEK-293 cells were sub-cultured onto 96-well plates pre-coated with poly-d-lysine and grown to confluence (6 to 8 days) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Ion transport rates were determined by 86Rb uptake measurements, and bumetanide binding was assayed by inhibition of86Rb uptake activity. All experiments were done at room temperature (∼22 °C), and the solutions were at pH 7.4. Before each flux assay, the cells were incubated in hypotonic low Cl− (163 mosm, 2 mm) medium for 1 h (67.5 mm Nagluconate, 2.5 mm Kgluconate, 0.5 mm CaCl2/MgCl2, 0.5 mmNa2HPO4/Na2SO4, and 7.5 mm NaHEPES) to activate the cotransporter (2Xu J. Lytle C. Zhu T.T. Payne J.A. Benz Jr., E. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The influxes were performed for 1 min in a flux medium containing 135 mmNaCl, 5 mm RbCl (2 μCi/ml 86RbCl), 1 mm CaCl2/MgCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4/Na2SO4, 15 mm NaHEPES, and 0.1 mm ouabain; when necessary, Na+ or Rb+ was replaced with equimolar amounts of N-methylglucamine and Cl− with gluconate. To determine bumetanide-insensitive influx, 250 μmbumetanide was added directly to the flux media; residual bumetanide-insensitive flux was largely Na+ and Cl− independent (data not shown) indicating that it was not due to incomplete inhibition of NKCC activity by bumetanide.86Rb uptake was terminated by addition of, and three rinses in, ice-cold stop solution (135 mm Kgluconate, 5 mm Nagluconate, 1 mmCaCl2/MgCl2, 1 mmNa2HPO4/Na2SO4, 15 mm NaHEPES, 250 μm bumetanide, and 0.1 mm ouabain). Cells were solubilized in 2% SDS and assayed for protein content and for 86Rb by counting Cerenkov radiation. Each concentration curve was carried out in a single row of the 96-well plate, and in a typical experiment there were 4 replicate rows. Data were handled on a per-row basis, and counts were normalized to the value at the highest concentration. Data are expressed as means ± S.E.M. among all rows in 3–7 experiments, as described in the figure legends, and non-linear least-squares curve fitting was carried out using the Simplex algorithm (program PLOT). 2B. Forbush, personal communication. We have not attempted to subtract the component of the bumetanide-sensitive background flux that may be contributed by HEK-cell cotransporters. We have noted that in cells expressinginactive NKCC mutants, the native HEK-cell cotransport rate is often greatly decreased, for reasons that are not yet understood. 3R. Behnke, P. Isenring, and B. Forbush, unpublished observations. If this phenomenon also occurs in NKCC1-transfected cells, then the component of the flux due to native cotransporters is actually substantially less than the 10–25% of the total that would be obtained on the basis of absolute flux rates in transfected and non-transfected cells (see Fig.4). In principal, the involvement of individual domains can be assessed by analyzing the behavior of deletion mutants. For example, both the Na-H exchanger (NHE-2) and band 3 (AE-1) are able to carry out antiport activity in the absence of their N-terminal domains (19Collins J.F. Honda T. Knobel S. Bulus N.M. Conary J. DuBois R. Ghishan F.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3938-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 28Lepke S. Becker A. Passow H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1106: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, our initial attempts to apply this approach have not succeeded. We prepared deletion mutants in both the N and C termini and expressed the constructs in HEK cells (deletions of residues 50–216 and alternatively 1004–1191). For neither construct were the 86Rb fluxes significantly above background, although Western blot analysis demonstrated that the mutant proteins were produced (data not shown). On examination of cells transfected with sNKCC1del:50–216 by immunofluorescence, it appeared that little if any of this construct was delivered to the cell surface. The chimeras described here provide a powerful means to test the hypotheses regarding the epitope localization of our anti-sNKCC1 antibodies. Largely through analysis of proteolytic fragmentation patterns, Lytle et al. (27Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Haas M. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25428-25437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the J7 epitope is located in the C-terminal 24 kDa of the sNKCC1 protein and that the J3 epitope is located within a central 20-kDa region that is now known to include the last three transmembrane helices. It was not possible, however, to accommodate all of the fragmentation data within the model. Fig.2 illustrates the results of Western blot analysis of the eight NKCC constructs expressed in HEK-293 cells, using J3 and J7 antibodies. These antibodies are specific for the shark protein, and neither the native HEK-cell transporter nor hNKCC1 was recognized. J7 was found to recognize only the chimeras that include the C terminus of sNKCC1 (Fig. 2, bottom), and it did not recognize the truncation mutant sNKCC1trunc:1004–1191 (data not shown). This demonstrates that the J7 epitope is within the region containing residues 1004–1191 of the C-terminal shark sequence. Since J7 does not recognize hNKCC1, the epitope must include residues that are different between sNKCC1 and hNKCC1; they include residues 1050–1168. This localization is consistent with our earlier hypothesis that the J7 epitope is in a 20-kDa C-terminal segment of the protein. In contrast, J3 labeled only chimeras that include the N terminus of sNKCC1 (Fig. 2, top), and the positive signal with sh0.9 demonstrates that the N terminus of the shark protein is indeed sufficient for antibody recognition. Thus our earlier assignment of the J3 epitope to a central domain based on proteolytic fragmentation patterns was incorrect. The localization to the N-terminal domain is further narrowed to residues 49–196 by the failure of J3 to bind to the deletion mutant sNKCC1del:50–216 (data not shown; J7 detected this truncated protein). Immunofluorescence studies using the J3 antibody (27Lytle C. Xu J.-C. Biemesderfer D. Haas M. Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25428-25437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) localized sNKCC1, sh0.9, sh13.1, and shs0.9/13.1 to the cell surface, as illustrated for shs0.9/13.1 in Fig.3. Some intracellular staining is also observed, a common finding with overexpression of membrane proteins. J3 recognizes the N terminus of sNKCC1, and constructs in which the N terminus was from human (hNKCC1, hs0.9, hs13.1, and hsh0.9/13.1) were negative with J3, as were HEK-293 cells (see hNKCC1 in Fig. 3). The intensity of the rhodamine signal was homogeneous for all the cells on a coverslip, suggesting that the technique used to select individual colonies allowed true clonal expansion. When stably expressed in HEK-293 cell lines, each of the chimeras in Fig. 1 exhibited robust levels of bumetanide-sensitive 86Rb influx, illustrated in Fig. 4. Although comparisons of absolute flux rates among individual clonal lines must be made with caution, it may be noted that NKCC1 constructs that contain the human transmembrane domain were found to mediate 86Rb influx at about the same rate as hNKCC1 (1st 4 pairs of bars), 7–9-fold above the endogenous cotransport activity of mock-transfected HEK-293 cells. Similarly, constructs containing the shark transmembrane domain exhibited transport rates similar to sNKCC1, 4–6-fold above the endogenous rate. It is likely that the difference in 86Rb influx rates between sNKCC1 and hNKCC1 is due in part to the fact that the ion binding sites of the shark cotransporter are not saturated with ions in our regular flux medium (see Ref. 2Xu J. Lytle C. Zhu T.T. Payne J.A. Benz Jr., E. Forbush III, B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2201-2205Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar and below). We have previously reported that NKCC1 is activated when intracellular [Cl−] is lowered and that this form of regulation appears to occur in HEK-293 cells as well as in the shark rectal gland (2Xu J.

Physiol. 1996; 39: C437-C448Crossref Google Scholar). For the shark cotransporter, we have identified threonine residues in N and C termini (Thr189and Thr1114) whose phosphorylation appears to be involved in cotransporter activation (2Xu J. Lytle C.

Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). After several purification steps by conventional column chromatography (47Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar), this yeast holoenzyme was found to contain RNA polymerase II, three GTFs (TFIIB, TFIIF, and TFIIH), the SRB proteins in which mutations suppress the deleterious effects on yeast cell growth of a truncated RNA polymerase II large subunit CTD (49Nonet M.L.

Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and many other polypeptides. This large complex, when complemented with TBP and TFIIE, was able to direct accurate transcriptional initiation in vitro and mediate a response to the activator protein GAL4-VP16 (47Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 48Kim Y.-J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D.

Recent studies with srb4 and srb6 mutants have provided evidence that this holoenzyme may be essential for transcription from most promotersin vivo (52Thompson C.M. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4587-4590Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). A multiprotein complex, known as a “mediator” of transcriptional activation by GAL4-VP16, was separated from the CTD in yeast holoenzyme by chromatography on columns containing anti-CTD antibody (48Kim Y.-J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 50Thompson C.M. Koleske A.J. Chao D.M. Young R.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 1361-1375Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). This complex seems to be associated with the CTD and contained TFIIF, many or all of the SRB proteins and GAL11, which has been implicated in transcriptional activation in S. cerevisiae (53Suzuki Y. Nogi Y. Abe A. Fukasawa T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4991-4999Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the presence of the remaining GTFs, this mediator stimulated basal transcription and enabled GAL4-VP16 to activate transcription (48Kim Y.-J. Bjorklund S. Li Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D. Cell. 1994; 77: 599-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar). Recently, a mammalian RNA polymerase II holoenzyme was isolated from a rat liver nuclear extract by co-immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal antibody against the MO15/CDK7 subunit of TFIIH (54Ossipow V. Tassan J.-P. Nigg E.A. Schibler U. Cell. 1995; 83: 137-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). This rat liver holoenzyme contained RNA polymerase II, TFIID, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH and was shown to be active for promoter-specific basal transcription. More recently, a human homologue of the yeastSRB7 gene was isolated and the mammalian SRB7 protein existed in a large RNA polymerase II holoenzyme from calf thymus (55Chao D. Gadbois E.L. Murray P.J. Anderson S.F. Sonu M.S. Parvin J.D. Young R.A. Nature. 1996; 380: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This holoenzyme contained only a substoichiometric amount of TFIIE and TFIIH and was capable of accurate initiation when supplemented with other missing GTFs. A modestly enhanced response to GAL4-VP16 was also observed in the presence of cofactors PC4 and HMG2. A similar preparation from human HeLa cells contained TFIIE, TFIIF, a sub-stoichiometric amount of TFIIH, and a number of proteins involved in DNA double-strand break repair or nucleotide excision repair (56Maldonado E.

Elongation by RNA polymerase II can be regulated by TFIIF (57Price D.H. Sluder A.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1465-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 58Bengal E.

Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Elongin is a heterotrimeric factor whose largest subunit, Elongin A, is the only subunit that is essential for its activity (63Aso T. Lane W. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1439-1443Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). TFIIF and Elongin accelerate the rate of elongation by RNA polymerase II, whereas TFIIS enables RNA polymerase II to transcribe through pause sites in the DNA. To accomplish this, TFIIS binds directly to RNA polymerase II (64Sopta M. Carthew R.W. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 65Agarwal K.

The catalytic center of RNA polymerase II then engages the new 3′ end and resumes RNA synthesis, thus allowing multiple attempts by transcribing polymerase II to overcome the pause sites (68Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 34: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). We have now used elongation factors TFIIS and Elongin as ligands for protein affinity chromatography and isolated a human RNA polymerase II holoenzyme from HeLa whole cell extract. This holoenzyme containing human RNA polymerase II and near-stoichiometric amounts of all the essential GTFs was capable of both promoter-specific basal transcription and activation by activator proteins. Frozen HeLa cells were purchased from Cellex Bioscience, Inc. The whole cell extract was prepared as described previously (41Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), except that the extract was dialyzed against affinity chromatography buffer (ACB) containing 0.05 m NaCl, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. A plasmid expressing a GST-TFIIS fusion protein was constructed by conventional procedures (69Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The plasmid pET11d (TFIIS), a gift from Dr. Z. Burton (Michigan State University), was linearized with the restriction enzymeNcoI, end-filled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase, and then cut with EcoRI. The plasmid pGEX2T (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was digested with SmaI and EcoRI. The fragment containing the TFIIS gene from pET11d(TFIIS) and the vector fragment from pGEX2T were purified from an agarose gel with a GENECLEAN II kit (Bio 101) and ligated to generate plasmid pGEX2T(TFIIS). To construct plasmids expressing GST fused to the carboxyl-terminal (amino acids 102–280) or the amino-terminal (amino acids 1–103) portion of TFIIS, the plasmid pGEX2T(TFIIS) was digested either with BamHI and XhoI or withXhoI and EcoRI and end-filled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. The resulting linear plasmid DNA fragments were then purified on an agarose gel and religated. To construct a GST-Elongin A amino-terminal fusion, a DNA fragment coding for amino acids 1–123 of Elongin A was made by polymerase chain reaction from plasmid pGEX4T-1-(elongin A) and ligated into the precut vector pGEX2T between its BamHI and SmaI sites. All plasmids were transformed into DH5α, and the GST and GST fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's protocol (Pharmacia). Affinity chromatography was carried out essentially as described previously (41Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The protein affinity columns were prepared by immobilizing GST or GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia) at a ligand concentration of 4 mg/ml. Affinity columns (40 μl) were pre-washed with 200 μl of ACB containing 1m NaCl and 400 μl of ACB containing 0.05 mNaCl. The columns were loaded with 400 μl of HeLa whole cell extract and washed with 400 μl of ACB containing 0.05 m NaCl. The bound proteins were then eluted with 160-μl aliquots of ACB containing 0.3 and 0.5 m NaCl. The eluates were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 7.5 or 10% gel and analyzed by Western blotting or silver staining. For a larger scale preparation of the holoenzyme, a 2-ml GST-TFIIS column was used and loaded with 20 ml of HeLa whole cell extract. The eluates from such large GST-TFIIS columns were dialyzed against ACB containing 0.05 m NaCl and concentrated about 10-fold by centrifugation onto Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon) before use in transcriptional assays. Polyclonal antibodies against CDK7, hMLH1, hMSH2, and PCNA and monoclonal antibodies against human TBP and TAFII130 were purchased from Santa Cruz. Monoclonal antibody against human TAFII70 was bought from Transduction Laboratories. Polyclonal antibody against TFIIA was bought from UBI. Recombinant GTF polypeptides produced in Escherichia coli were used as immunogens to prepare rabbit polyclonal antibodies against TFIIB and subunits of TFIIE and TFIIF. The enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Corp.) was used in all the Western blotting analyses. The yields of various GTF polypeptides were determined by electrophoresing various known amounts of the recombinant GTFs on the same gels. In vitrotranscription in reactions (50 μl) containing 100–400 ng of linear DNA templates was carried out as described previously (41Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Plasmid pML(C2AT)-50 containing a G-less cassette downstream of the adenovirus major late promoter (−50 to +10) was used for basal transcription assays (70Sawadogo M. Roeder R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Plasmid pML(C2AT)-50G5 containing five consensus GAL4-binding sites cloned upstream of the promoter in plasmid pML(C2AT)-50 (a gift from Dr. H. Xiao) was used for activated transcription assays. A GAL4-VP16 fusion protein containing amino acids 1–147 of GAL4 and amino acids 413–490 of herpes simplex virus VP16 and a GAL4-Sp1 fusion protein containing amino acids 1–147 of GAL4 and amino acids 1–62 of Sp1 were kindly provided by A. Emili and Dr. C. J. Ingles. Typically, 500 μl of the holoenzyme eluted from a GST-TFIIS column that had been extensively dialyzed against ACB containing 0.05 m NaCl and 30% glycerol was loaded onto a 15-ml Sepharose CL-2B column (Pharmacia). The gel filtration chromatography was carried out in ACB containing 0.05m NaCl and 20% glycerol, because we have observed that the use of lower glycerol concentrations during the gel filtration chromatography leads to partial dissociation of the complex into components with lower apparent molecular weight. 500-μl fractions were collected and concentrated about 5-fold on Centricon-10 concentrators (Amicon) before being analyzed by Western blotting. Forin vitro transcription assays, the fractions were concentrated about 10-fold. E. coli 70 S ribosomes were a generous gift from M. Kiel and Dr. M. C. Ganoza. Elongation factor TFIIS interacts with RNA polymerase II and promotes transcript cleavage in a stalled elongation complex, leading to increased read-through by the transcribing polymerase (68Gu W. Powell W. Mote Jr., J. Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 34: 25604-25616Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 71Izban M.G. Luze D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12874-12885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify factors that interact with TFIIS and regulate its activity, we fused TFIIS to glutathione S-transferase (GST) and used GST-TFIIS as a column ligand in affinity chromatography experiments. Whole cell extracts from human HeLa cells (41Xiao H. Pearson A. Coulombe B. Truant R. Zhang S. Regier J.L. Triezenberg S.J. Reinberg D. Flores O. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7013-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) were chromatographed on a GST-TFIIS affinity column and a GST control column. The columns were extensively washed with affinity chromatography buffer (ACB) containing 0.05m NaCl and eluted successively with buffers containing 0.3 and 0.5 m NaCl. The eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gels were stained with silver (Fig.1 A). Based on using a series of dilutions of the HeLa whole cell extract, we estimated that approximately 0.3–0.6% of the total protein in the soluble whole cell extract bound to the GST-TFIIS column in various experiments (comparelane 4 with lanes 6–8 in Fig. 1 A). Most of these bound proteins eluted in the 0.3 m NaCl fraction from the GST-TFIIS column (compare lanes 4 and5) and did not bind to the control GST column (comparelanes 3 and 4). The pattern of the proteins that bound specifically to the GST-TFIIS column (lane 4) was very complex, considering that RNA polymerase II, which we expected to bind to TFIIS, has only 12 subunits (72Archambault J. Friesen J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 703-724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the column eluates were Western blotted with a monoclonal antibody directed against the CTD in the largest subunit (RPB1) of RNA polymerase II (Fig. 1 B), RNA polymerase II was found in similar amounts in both the 0.3 and 0.5 m NaCl eluates from the GST-TFIIS column but was undetectable in the eluate from the GST column. Consistent with this, various subunits of purified calf thymus RNA polymerase II co-migrated in SDS-PAGE with polypeptides in both the 0.3 and 0.5 m NaCl eluates from the GST-TFIIS column (Fig.1 A, lanes 2, 4, and 5). More interestingly, when Western blotting was done with antibodies against subunits of the various GTFs, we found that TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH all co-eluted with the RNA polymerase II specifically in the 0.3m NaCl eluate from the GST-TFIIS column (Fig.1 B). Quantitative Western blotting (Fig. 1 D), using as standards a set of recombinant GTF polypeptides produced inE. coli, revealed that approximately equimolar amounts of the RNA polymerase II and the various GTFs were present in this fraction (see Table I), although the amount of TBP was about 50% lower than the amounts of the other GTFs. Since the volume (40 μl) of 0.3 m NaCl eluate used for Western blotting in Fig. 1 D (also see Table I) was derived from 3.3 × 107 HeLa cells, we calculate that the 0.3m NaCl eluate contained approximately 4000 molecules of TBP and 8000 molecules of RNA polymerase II and each other GTF per HeLa cell equivalent. The RNA polymerase II and the GTFs comprised about one-half to two-thirds of the total protein in this fraction. None of the GTFs were present with the RNA polymerase II in the 0.5m NaCl fraction (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, it appeared that RNA polymerase II exists in two different forms in HeLa whole cell extracts, one that is complexed and co-elutes with the GTFs in the 0.3 m NaCl fraction and one that is free of GTFs and elutes from a GST-TFIIS column in the 0.5 m NaCl fraction. Isolation of the complex was also possible when the affinity column was loaded and washed with buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl, rather than 0.05 m NaCl, but the yield of holoenzyme, in that case, was somewhat lower (data not shown). Together, the 0.3 and 0.5m NaCl fractions contained about 20% of the RNA polymerase II in the extract that was loaded onto the GST-TFIIS column, and the remaining RNA polymerase II in the extract flowed through the column (data not shown).Table IGeneral initiation factors in RNA polymerase II holoenzymeGTFsAmount in 40 μl holoenzymeMass[GTF]1-aMeasurements for the GTF polypeptides were determined by quantitative Western blotting and normalized to the amount of RNA polymerase II./[RNAPII]Total GTF in holoenzymengkDa%RNAPII2251-bAmount measured when highly purified calf thymus RNA polymerase II was used as a standard.5001.010TFIIB15351.010TBP (TFIID)8380.55TAFII130 (TFIID)ND1-cND, not determined.130ND45TAFII70 (TFIID)ND73ND45TFIIE56 (TFIIE)20500.86RAP74 (TFIIF)30581.240RAP30 (TFIIF)15281.312p62 (TFIIH)30621.110CDK7 (TFIIH)ND40ND61-a Measurement"
https://openalex.org/W2123148431,"Arachidonic acid (AA), through its myriad metabolites, is involved in inflammation in a number of ways. AA is produced and released by several cell types, including endothelial cells (EC), and acts on a variety of cells. EC activation plays a key role in inflammation presumably by modulating the immune response through up- or down-regulation of several genes. We have previously shown that AA and its nonmetabolizable analogue, 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), inhibit up-regulation of proinflammatory genes in EC. In the present study we identify a mechanism to explain the inhibitory effects: AA and ETYA both inhibit the translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to the nucleus by blocking the degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) and thus stabilizing the IκB/NF-κB complex. To investigate the mechanism whereby AA inhibits up-regulation of genes encoding proinflammatory mediators, we examined the ability of ETYA to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mediated phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. Western blot analysis revealed that preincubation of EC with ETYA for 40 min prior to stimulation with TNF-α inhibits the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα. These findings establish a mechanism by which AA inhibits nuclear translocation of NF-κB and thereby explaining its modulatory role in the induction of proinflammatory genes.

While AA metabolites can have potent proinflammatory effects, prostacyclin and certain AA metabolites have also been shown to have antiinflammatory actions. Little is reported on the effects mediated by AA itself. Endothelial cells (EC), which both release AA and serve as the possible targets of AA released by EC and other cells, play a prominent role in inflammation and hemostasis and organ rejection. The activation of EC results in the up-regulation in EC of genes encoding adhesion molecules, procoagulant factors, cytokines and other molecules, which can participate in the inflammatory-thrombotic responses characterizing a number of conditions including graft rejection. Stimulated by reports demonstrating a significant improvement in graft survival of animals treated with linoleic acid and other precursors of AA, we have previously demonstrated (1Stuhlmeier K.M. Tarn C. Csizmadia V. Bach F.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that AA itself can inhibit the up-regulation in EC of several key genes/molecules involved in inflammation and rejection, including E-selectin, ICAM-1, and IL-8. Furthermore, using E-selectin as a prototype gene, we showed that inhibition is at the transcriptional level. Transcriptional up-regulation of proinflammatory genes involved in EC activation is strongly dependent on activation of NF-κB, which involves phosphorylation and degradation of IκB leading to translocation of the NF-κB heterodimer to the nucleus. The NF-κB/IκBα system has been shown to exert transcriptional regulation on proinflammatory genes involved in EC activation (2Read M. Whitley M. Williams A. Collins T. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 503Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Most genes encoding adhesion molecules, cytokines, and other proinflammatory genes have functional NF-κB binding elements in their promoter regions. In the cytoplasm of quiescent EC, IκBα forms a complex with NF-κB and thereby prevents migration of NF-κB into the nucleus (3Brown K. Park S. Kanno T. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2532-2536Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which an agent can inhibit NF-κB activation is by preventing the phosphorylation and thus degradation of IκBα, referred to as “IκB stabilization.” We show in this paper that the inhibitory effect of AA on EC activation is due to interference at this level of transcriptional regulation. Porcine EC were isolated and passaged in our laboratory as described previously (4Stuhlmeier K.M. Csizmadia V. Cheng Q. Winkler H. Bach F.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2186-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, EC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 4.5 g/liter glucose and supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone), l-glutamine and 50 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Experiments were performed in DMEM under serum-free conditions. Before incubating EC with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), cells were washed three times with prewarmed serum-free DMEM. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF) was diluted in serum-free medium and added to the EC; in cases where lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used as a stimulus, fetal calf serum was added simultaneously with LPS to a final concentration of 5%.

Okadaic acid was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Costa Mesa, CA. Nuclear extracts from porcine and human EC were prepared as described (5Johnson D.R. Levanat S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). The double-stranded oligonucleotides used in all experiments were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. After labeling, 5 μg of nuclear extract was incubated with 100,000 cpm of labeled probe in the presence of 3 μg of poly(dI-dC) at room temperature for 30 min followed by separation of this mixture on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in Tris/glycine/EDTA buffer at pH 8.5. For specific competition, 7 pmol of unlabeled NF-κB oligonucleotides was included; and for nonspecific competition, 7 pmol of the double-stranded mutant κB oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTAGATTTTACTTTCCGGAGAGGA-3′ and 7 pmol of pig E-selectin CRE-like were used. For supershift assays, 1 μl of the monoclonal anti-NF-κB p56 subunit antibody (Boehringer Mannheim) was added to the nuclear extract simultaneously with the labeled probe. Cytosolic extracts were prepared as described (5Johnson D.R. Levanat S. Bale A.E. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar) except that further protease inhibitors, TPCK, TLCK, aprotinin, leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, benzamidine, chymostatin, and pepstatin, were added. Equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (12%), transferred to an Immobilon P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) and probed with the rabbit polyclonal antibody C21 (Santa Cruz, Biotechnology) directed against IκBα as described (23Wrighton C.J. Hofer-Warbinek R. Moll T. Eytner R. Bach F.H. de Martin R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and the enhanced chemiluminescence assay (Amersham Life Science Inc., Arlington Heights, IL) according to the manufacturer instructions. All assays were done at least three times, and representative experiments are shown. We reported earlier (1Stuhlmeier K.M. Tarn C. Csizmadia V. Bach F.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that AA and a nonmetabolizable AA analog, ETYA, inhibit the expression of several proinflammatory genes in EC. We studied E-selectin as an example of these genes and demonstrated by run-off analysis that the up-regulation of this gene is blocked at the transcriptional level. We now report that this inhibitory effect of AA and ETYA in EC is based on the stabilization of IκBα by these 20:4ω6 fatty acids, therefore blocking nuclear translocation of NF-κB, a transcription factor known to be essential for the up-regulation of several genes that characterize EC activation (6Collins T. Read M.A. Neish A.S. Whitley M.Z. Thanos D. Maniatis T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 represents an electrophoretic EMSA, showing a time course of TNF-induced NF-κB translocation. EC were stimulated with TNF for 0, 10, 30, 60 and 120 min (Fig. 1,lanes TNF 10′, TNF 30′, TNF 60′, and TNF 120′, respectively), after which the nuclear extract was isolated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The EMSA shows that after only 10 min of stimulation with TNF, there is an easily detectable translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, which increases further with time. However, when EC were pre-treated with 55 μm ETYA for 30 min followed by stimulation with 5 ng/ml of TNF for an additional 10, 30, 60, or 120 min (lanes E +TNF 10′, E+ TNF 30′, E+ TNF 60′,andE + TNF 120′, respectively), the TNF-induced translocation (activation) of NF-κB into the nucleus was completely blocked. Fig. 1also demonstrates that pre-incubation of EC with 55 μmETYA alone for 0, 15, 30, or 45 min (lanes E+ TNF 0, E 15 MIN, E 30 MIN, and E 45 MIN, respectively) prior to stimulation with TNF did not lead to activation of NF-κB. Exogenous AA also suppresses TNF-induced NF-κB translocation. Stimulation of EC with 5 ng/ml TNF for 60 min leads to strong activation of NF-κB (Fig. 2, lane TNF 5 ng). When these cells were incubated with 35 (lane AA 35+ TNF) or 65 μm AA (lane AA 65 +TNF) for 45 min prior to stimulation with 5 ng/ml of TNF, the TNF effect on NF-κB translocation was completely abolished. Incubation of EC with increasing amounts of AA, without blocking the enzymes involved in the metabolism of AA, leads to a weak but significant and dose-dependent augmentation of the levels of NF-κB found in the nucleus. Lanes AA 35 andAA 65 in Fig. 2 show the results of an experiment in which EC were incubated for 105 min with 35 or 65 μm AA before the nuclear proteins were extracted and an EMSA was carried out. Incubating EC with 35 μm exogenous AA (lane AA 35) results in weak activation of NF-κB; increasing the amount of AA to 65 μm (lane AA 65) results in a stronger translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus. These results are not surprising as several of the AA metabolites are known to be involved in cell activation (7Laniado-Schwartzman M. Lavovsky Y. Stoltz R.A. Conners M.S. Falck J.R. Chauhan K. Abraham N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24321-24327Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this and similar experiments on human umbilical vein cells (data not shown), 35 μm AA consistently demonstrated a stronger net inhibitory effect on NF-κB activation. Taken together, these data demonstrate that AA can inhibit the TNF-induced activation of NF-κB and might explain the phenomenon, seen in other experiments, that higher doses of AA do not lead to a correspondingly greater inhibition of TNF-induced gene up-regulation, as higher amounts of AA result in increasing amounts of AA metabolites that activate NF-κB. Thus the AA effect on NF-κB activation reflects the net effect of inhibition and activation. The hypothesis that some AA metabolites might be responsible for activation, but that AA itself inhibits NF-κB activation, is further supported by the fact that the stable and nonmetabolizable AA analog ETYA does not activate NF-κB. Also shown in Fig. 2 are the results of an experiment in which two doses of ETYA (35 and 65 μm) were added to EC 45 min before stimulating these EC with either 5 ng/ml TNF (lanes E 35 + TNF and E 65 + TNF) or medium alone (lanes E 35 and E 65) for 1 h. These experiments demonstrate that 35 μm of ETYA is sufficient to completely block the TNF-induced NF-κB activation and that neither 35 μm nor 65 μm of ETYA only leads to activation and translocation of NF-κB. We reported earlier (1Stuhlmeier K.M. Tarn C. Csizmadia V. Bach F.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) that the precursors of AA, linoleic acid and γ-linolenic acid inhibited the TNF, LPS, or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced up-regulation of several genes although, compared with AA or ETYA, higher doses of these unsaturated fatty acids had to be used to get comparable inhibition. We tested whether the inhibitory effect of the AA precursor, γ-linolenic acid, is due to the same mechanism as that seen with AA. Fig. 3shows the effect of γ-linolenic acid on TNF-induced activation of NF-κB. Compared with TNF-induced NF-κB activation (lane: TNF 5 ng), pre-incubation of EC with γ-linolenic acid (100 μm) for 45 min leads to significant inhibition of NF-κB translocation when these pre-treated cells are stimulated with 5 ng/ml TNF (lane γ-LIN+ TNF) for 1 h. Despite the inhibitory effect of γ-linolenic acid on TNF-induced activation of NF-κB, adding this polyunsaturated fatty acid alone to EC leads to a weak up-regulation of NF-κB (lane γ-LIN) compared with control cells (lane MED), which is consistent with the findings of others (8Hennig B. Toborek M. Joshibarve S. Barger S.W. Barve S. Mattson M.P. Mcclain C.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutrition. 1996; 63: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Whether further metabolism of linoleic acid and γ-linolenic acid to AA is necessary to exert the inhibitory effect, or whether these reagents are inhibitory by themselves, is not yet clear as specific inhibitors for desaturase and elongase are not available. Again, treatment of EC for up to 285 min with ETYA (60 μm) only does not lead to activation of NF-κB (lanes ETYA 15′-ETYA 285′). The main objective of this work has been to expand our insight into the surprising effect of AA on gene regulation in endothelial cells as reported earlier (1Stuhlmeier K.M. Tarn C. Csizmadia V. Bach F.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1417-1423Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to gain a better understanding of possible effects that polyunsaturated fatty acids might play in the regulation of inflammatory responses, we tested a panel of saturated, mono-, and polyunsaturated fatty acids for their effectiveness as inhibitors of NF-κB translocation. Preincubation of EC with 65 μm of γ-linoleic acid (6,9,12-octadecatrienoic acid), dihomo-γ-linoleic acid (8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid), oleic acid (9-octadecenoic acid), 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid, 4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid, Mead acid (5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid), 11,4-eicosadienoic acid, and the saturated fatty acids arachidic acid (C20:0) and stearic acid (octadecanoic acid, C18:0) for 45 min prior stimulation with TNF (5 ng/ml) did not influence the TNF-induced translocation of NF-κB (data not shown). Under our test conditions, none of these fatty acids lead to NF-κB activation per se, as incubation of EC with these fatty acids, for a total of 135 min and without adding TNF, did not lead to activation of NF-κB (data not shown). Originally, ETYA has been synthesized as an AA analog, only later has it become clear that ETYA blocks the enzymes involved in metabolism of AA. Like AA, ETYA binds to cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase. However, because of some structural differences, ETYA cannot be metabolized by these enzymes, and, therefore, bound ETYA blocks further binding of AA. Antioxidants have been shown to block NF-κB activation (9Brennan P. O'Neill L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1260: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 10Goebeler M. Roth J. Brocker E.B. Sorg C. Schulze O.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2459-2467PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ferran C. Millan M.T. Csizmadia V. Cooper J.T. Brostjan C. Bach F.H. Winkler H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). To what degree AA metabolites might be involved in the effect seen with AA has been addressed in our previous work where we tested several AA metabolites for their effectiveness in EC gene suppression, none of them had any significant impact on TNF-induced E-selectin up-regulation. Several known cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors are also known to possess antioxidative properties, which excludes these reagents from further testing the unlikely hypothesis that ETYA acts through inhibition of prostaglandins or lipoxygenase metabolites. Besides, EC do not produce leukotriene, the lipoxygenase products of AA, without leukocyte-derived substrates (12Claesson H.E. Haeggström J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 173: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Furthermore, with the exemption of a few, such as prostaglandin A (11Ferran C. Millan M.T. Csizmadia V. Cooper J.T. Brostjan C. Bach F.H. Winkler H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 214: 212-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), most AA metabolites are known to be proinflammatory and therefore most likely leading to activation of NF-κB (13Camandola S. Leonarduzzi G. Musso T. Varesio L. Carini R. Scavazza A. Chiarpotto E. Bauerle P.A. G. P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 643-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In the early events leading to NF-κB activation by TNF, prostaglandin or lipoxygenase metabolites play essentially no role. In accordance with our conclusions are the results of experiments (data not shown) where NS-398, a potent inhibitor of cyclooxygenase (14Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar) was used without any significant effect on TNF (5 ng/ml) induced NF-κB activation. Similarly, treating EC with indomethacin (10−4 and 10−5m, respectively) prior to stimulation with TNF has no influence on TNF (5 ng/ml) -induced NF-κB translocation. The polyunsaturated fatty acid, 8,11-eicosadiynoic acid is another nontoxic acetylenic fatty acid that has been shown to inhibit eicosanoid biosynthesis at several stages (15Laposata M. Kaiser S.L. Reich E.L. Prostaglandins. 1987; 33: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This unsaturated fatty acid failed to influence TNF-induced NF-κB up-regulation in our experiments on EC. Lastly, we tested 9,12-octadecadiynoic acid a polyunsaturated fatty acid and irreversible inhibitor of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, which is, compared on a mol to mol ratio, a stronger inhibitor of cyclooxygenase than ETYA (16Vanderhoek J.Y. Lands W.E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 296: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar,17Dowing D.T. Barve J.A. Gunstone F.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 280: 343-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that incubation of EC with 10, 25, and 50 μm of 9,12-octadecadiynoic acid prior to stimulation with TNF (5 ng/ml) for 1.5 h had significantly less suppressive effect on the TNF-induced NF-κB activation than treatment with similar amounts of the “weaker” cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitor ETYA (data not shown). These data support the concept that it is indeed the structural similarities between AA and ETYA that are responsible for the similarities seen on NF-κB inhibition and that AA metabolites are not involved in the events leading to AA/ETYA-induced suppression on TNF-activated NF-κB translocation. Our working concept is based on the hypothesis that upon cell activation free AA is released intra- or extracellularly to keep inflammatory events localized or as a feedback mechanism to control the extent of inflammatory responses. For these reasons, the amount of free AA has to be tightly controlled. One method commonly used in experiments involving AA and other fatty acids is the binding of these compounds to carrier proteins such as albumin, where such binding seems to render AA inactive, as experiments performed in the presence of albumin demonstrated little or no influence on TNF-induced E-selectin up-regulation, a gene which has been shown to be NF-κB dependent (data not shown). Due to their highly hydrophobic properties, fatty acids are difficult to keep evenly immersed in cell culture solutions. Binding of fatty acids to albumin facilitates the dispersion of AA in culture medium and therefore minimizes the loss due to binding of fatty acids to tubes as well as tissue culture material. For the above mentioned reason, this method was not appropriate in our experiments. To better understand the amount of AA being taken up by EC in our experiments performed under serum-free conditions, EC were incubated with 60 μm AA pulsed with 3H-AA for 45 min. Subsequently, the amount of 3H-AA associated with EC was compared with 3H-AA in culture medium. In these experiments, an equivalent of 9 μm (15 ± 4%) of the added 60 μm AA was bound to EC. An important mechanism in controlling NF-κB activation is provided by a protein-protein interaction involving members of the IκB family with NF-κB. As demonstrated by others (18Liou H.C. Baltimore D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar), IκB binds to and forms a complex with the subunits (p65 and p50) of NF-κB, thereby inhibiting transmigration of NF-κB into the nucleus. Upon stimulation of cells with a wide array of reagents including TNF, IκB is phosphorylated (19Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), ubiquitinated (20Scherer D. Brockman J. Chen Z. Maniatis T. Ballard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 259-263Crossref Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and subsequently degraded. We tested the hypothesis that AA might influence the activation/translocation of NF-κB by preventing the degradation of IκB, which would result in stabilization of the IκB-NF-κB complex. Fig. 4 shows the result of a Western blot, where cytoplasmic extracts of porcine EC were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with an anti-IκBα antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in this figure and demonstrated by others (21Miyamoto S. Maki M. Schmitt M.J. Hatanaka M. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12740-12744Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), stimulation of EC with 5 ng/ml TNF leads to rapid proteolysis of IκBα, as virtually all the IκBα present in the cytoplasm is degraded within 10 min. In contrast to the nearly nondetectable levels of IκBα in the cytoplasm of cells stimulated with TNF only for 10 and 30 min (Fig. 4 A,lanes TNF 10′ and TNF 30′) PAEC pre-treated with 55 μm ETYA for 30 min prior to addition of TNF for 10 or 30 min (Fig. 4 A, lanes E + TNF 10′ andE + TNF 30′), show no changes in the amount of IκBα present in the cytoplasm. We achieved identical results when we used human umbilical vein endothelial cell instead of porcine EC to study the effect of ETYA on IκBα stabilization (data not shown). The first step leading to IκBα degradation requires phosphorylation of IκBα at serines 32 and 36 (22Traenckner E. Pahl H. Henkel T. Schmidt K. Wilk S. Baeuerle P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The inducible phosphorylation of IκBα is readily detected in Western blots as a slight decrease in protein mobility as deomonstrated by us (23Wrighton C.J. Hofer-Warbinek R. Moll T. Eytner R. Bach F.H. de Martin R. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and others (24Pahl H.L. Kraus B. Schultze-Osthoff K. Decker T. Traencker E. Vogt M. Myers C. Parks T. Warring P. Muhlbacher A. Czernilofsky A.P. Bauerle A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 25Pierce J.W. Read M.A. Ding H. Luscinskas F.W. Collins T. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3961-3969PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, treatment of EC with ETYA (ETYA 30′) only, or with ETYA followed by TNF (E + TNF 10′), did not lead to changes in the mobility of IκBα. Gliotoxin has been shown to allow IκBα phosphorylation but prevents its degradation (24Pahl H.L. Kraus B. Schultze-Osthoff K. Decker T. Traencker E. Vogt M. Myers C. Parks T. Warring P. Muhlbacher A. Czernilofsky A.P. Bauerle A. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1829-1840Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). We performed identical control experiments using EC pretreated with gliotoxin (1 μg/ml) followed by okadaic acid (OA) (0.5 or 1 μm, respectively). The results of an experiment, shown in Fig. 4 B, are consistent with the hypothesis that ETYA prevents the phosphorylation of IκBα and therefore inhibits IκBα degradation leading to the inhibition of NF-κB translocation. The controls for the EMSA are shown in Fig.5. In the first lane (M), nuclear extracts of noninduced cells were separated and compared with nuclear extracts isolated from cells treated with 5 ng/ml TNF (lanes 2–5) for 1 h. The specificity of binding to the consensus NF-κB element is demonstrated by the ability of unlabeled NF-κB (cold) and the failure of a mutated NF-κB element (mut) and a consensus CRE-element (CRE) to bind competitively to NF-κB. The last line in this figure (p65) demonstrates the presence of p65 in the complex bound to the NF-κB element in induced EC. When a monoclonal anti-p65 antibody was incubated with the nuclear extract, it blocked the formation of the upper, slower migrating complex. In summary, we have demonstrated that AA, independent of its metabolites, can play a key role in EC gene regulation. AA stabilizes the IκBα/NF-κB complex and therefore suppresses NF-κB translocation; given the key role of NF-κB in the up-regulation of proinflammatory genes with EC activation, this results in inhibition of gene induction. Despite the large amount of data collected on AA and its metabolites, the relationship of AA uptake and AA release to the production of metabolic compounds and their subsequent biological impact still remains obscure (26Chilton F.H. Fonteh A.N. Surette M.E. Triggiani M. Winkler J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the past, AA was merely seen as a precursor for bioactive eicosanoids. More recently it has emerged that AA itself can influence cellular communication systems at several levels (8Hennig B. Toborek M. Joshibarve S. Barger S.W. Barve S. Mattson M.P. Mcclain C.J. Am. J. Clin. Nutrition. 1996; 63: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 27Khan W. Blobe G.C. Hannun Y.A. Cell.

Chem. 1996; 271: 2949-2954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Our findings strongly support and help to further establish the critical role of AA in intracellular signaling. Our results also bolster the development and use of AA analogs such as ETYA as antiinflammatory drugs. Whether our findings might provide further insight into the antiinflammatory mechanisms of actions of drugs such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and others, remains a matter of speculation. For a long time, aspirin, the most widely used nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug, has been thought to act solely through inhibition of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. Only recently has it become clear that aspirin can block the translocation of NF-κB, the key transcription factor in the activation of most proinflammatory genes (14Kopp E. Ghosh S. Science. 1994; 265: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (1621) Google Scholar). It seems likely, however, that these drugs, which block either cyclooxygenase, lipoxygenase, or both, may counteract inflammation by increasing intracellular levels of free AA, subsequently suppressing NF-κB. This hypothesis, supported by our data, would offer yet another appealing explanation for the beneficial effect and the “mode of action” of these compounds."

It has been suggested that, depending on its expression, GAIP can be a regulator of trimeric Gi protein signaling pathways. In the present study we show that the GAIP mRNA content declines during the enterocytic differentiation of two cell lines derived from human colon adenocarcinomas: HT-29 and Caco-2. In undifferentiated HT-29 cells, when the GDP/GTP cycle on the trimeric Gi3 protein is interrupted by either pertussis toxin treatment or by the transfection of a mutant of the Gαi3 protein with no GTPase activity (Q204L), we observed a decrease in the GAIP mRNA content. As these conditions are known to impair the Gi3-dependent lysosomal-autophagic pathway existing in undifferentiated HT-29 cells, we have investigated the role of GAIP in controling the lysosomal-autophagic pathway. Overexpression of GAIP stimulated protein degradation along the macroautophagic pathway. In contrast, overexpression of GAIP did not modify the low rate of macroautophagy in cells expressing the Q204L mutant of the Gαi3 protein.

This mode of regulation of G protein-coupled signaling systems seems to be universal as members of the RGS family exist in yeast (9Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and nematodes (10Koelle M.R. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 115-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). The function of several RGS proteins have also been reported to inhibit G protein-mediated MAP kinase activation in mammalian cells (11Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). GAIP, which was originally thought to specifically interact with the Gαi3 protein (4De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), is now known to be a GTPase-activating proteins for Gαq and blocks in vitro activation of phospholipase Cβ (12Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). But so far GAIP has not been shown to regulate a G protein signaling pathway in mammalian cells. Recently we have shown that the sequestration step of the lysosomal-autophagic pathway, in HT-29 cells, is controlled by a trimeric Gi3 protein (13Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When bound to GTP the Gi3 protein inhibits macroautophagic sequestration (14Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.-J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). From theses results we have hypothesized that GAIP is involved in the control of Gαi3-mediated macroautophagy in HT-29 cells. In the present work we show that (i) in cells having a low capacity for macroautophagy due either to a blockade in the GDP/GTP cycle on the Gi3 protein or to their state of enterocytic differentiation the expression of GAIP mRNA is reduced; (ii) overexpression of GAIP, by transfection, stimulates the lysosomal-autophagic pathway except in cells that express a mutant Gαi3 protein-deficient in GTPase activity.

Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schuell (Dassel, Germany). The bicinchoninic acid kit was from Pierce. Rat cDNA encoding the αi3-subunit was kindly provided by Dr. R. Reed (John Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD) and mRNA isolated from human duodenum, jejunum, and colon were provided by Dr. D. Darmoul (INSERM 410, Paris, France). Enzymes for cloning and sequencing, synthetic oligonucleotides, and Trizol™ for mRNA extraction were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Cergy Pontoise, France).

Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and calcium phosphate precipitation kits were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). Polyclonal antibodies to the αi3-subunit were from E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. (Les Ulis, France) and was raised against a decapeptide from the C-terminal of the protein (15Simonds W.F. Goldsmith P.K. Codina J. Unson C.G. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7809-7813Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The Rediprime random primer labeling kit, N+-hybond membranes, and the radioisotopes α-35S-dATP (1000 Ci/mmol), [3H]raffinose (5–15 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]GTP (>1000 Ci/mmol),l-[U-14C]valine (288.5 mCi/mmol), and125I-labeled sheep anti-rabbit antibodies were from Amersham Corp. (Les Ulis, France). cDNA were synthesized from mRNA isolated from HT-29 cells and were used to amplify a full-length cDNA encoding GAIP, using PCR. Incubations for PCR were described previously (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). The sense PCR primer began with a BamHI site: 5′-CGCGGATCCATGCCCACCCCGCATGAG-3′. The antisense PCR primer was: 5′-CGGAATTCGGGGTCTGTGCTGCTGGGGGCGGCCTA-3′. Before sequencing the PCR product was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of either the plasmid pcDNA3 (sense) or the plasmid pBK/CMV (antisense). cDNAs encoding the Gαi3 protein or GAIP were subcloned into the His-tag fusion vector pTrcHis. cDNA inserts were downstream and in frame with a sequence that encodes a N-terminal fusion peptide containing an ATG translation initiation codon, six histidine residues in series that function as a metal binding domain. Plasmids were transformed into the bacterial strain TOP 10 and induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. His-tagged proteins were purified by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads, dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and stored at −80 °C. For binding of His-tagged GAIP protein to the Gαi3protein in HT-29 cell homogenates, 1 mg of homogenate in buffer A (20 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.0, 380 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT, 6 mm MgCl2) containing GDP (10 μm) or GDP (10 μm) and AlF4− (30 μm), were incubated 30 min at 4 °C with 5 μg of His-tagged GAIP (7Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Binding of endogenous GAIP to His-tagged Gαi3 protein (5 μg) loaded with GDP (10 μm) or GDP (10 μm) and AlF4− (30 μm) was performed as described above, but an incubation for 30 min at 20 °C was required for nucleotide loading to His-tagged Gαi3protein before the assay. Homogenates were solubilized with 1% cholate and detergent-soluble extracts obtained after centrifugation at 100,000 × gwere added to Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads, washed five times with buffer A (supplemented with 20 mmimidazole, 0.1% polyoxyethylene-10-lauryl ether, 1 μmGDP, or 1 μm GDP and 30 μmAlF4−), and eluted with 300 mm imidazole (7Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Eluted proteins resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were detected by staining with Coomassie Blue. The identity of Gαi3 protein bound to GAIP was determined by immunoblotting with specific antibody (14Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.-J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Purified His-tagged Gαi3 protein was loaded with 5 μm [γ-32P]GTP in 60 μl of buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm ETDA, 1 mmDTT) containing 0.0125% Lubrol PX for 15 min at 30 °C. Magnesium was excluded from this loading reaction to slow hydrolysis. Free nucleotide was removed from the GTP-bound Gαi3 protein by centrifugation (200 × g for 3 min at 4 °C) through 1 ml of G50 Sephadex column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) that was equilibrated in buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1 mm ETDA, 1 mm DTT). The GTPase assay solution contained 10 μl of GTP-bound Gαi3 protein (200 nm) and His-tagged GAIP (2 μm) in 20 μl of buffer B supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2 and 500 μm GTP. GTP hydrolysis was determined by measuring the release of phosphate at 20 °C for the indicated times (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Buffer alone and boiled GAIP were included as controls. The rat Gαi3, the GAIP, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes were32P-labeled to a specific activity of 109cpm/μg by random priming. Hybridizations were performed at 45 °C in the presence of formamide and high-stringency washes were performed in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60 °C. When used, 500 ng/ml PTX were added to cells for 16 h before mRNA extraction. Caco-2 and HT-29 cells were cultured as described previously (16Ogier-Denis E. Blais A. Houri J.-J. Voisin T. Trugnan G. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4285-4290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wice B.M. Trugnan G. Pinto M. Rousset M. Chevalier G. Dussaulx E. Lacroix B. Zweibaum A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 139-146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Q204L-expressing cells were maintained in G418-containing medium as reported previously (14Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.-J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Plasmids (20 μg) were introduced into undifferentiated HT-29 cells and Q204L-expressing cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method. Cells were used 72 h after transfection. [3H]Raffinose sequestration was monitored as reported previously (18Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. De Stefanis D. Bauvy C. Baccino F.M. Isidoro C. Codogno P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 106/500 μl) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with 2 μCi of [3H]raffinose, subjected to electroinjection (at ambient temperature), and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min, followed by 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and dispersed in complete medium with 5 mm 3-MA, as indicated. When used PTX was added 18 h before the electroinjection and present during the incubation period. Subsequently, at different times, the cells were washed twice with 10% sucrose at 4 °C, resuspended in 0.5 ml of 10% sucrose, and homogenized by five strokes in a glass/Teflon homogenizer on ice. Immediately after homogenization, 0.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5) was added, and 1 ml of the cell homogenate was layered on the top of a 4-ml cushion of buffered metrizamide/sucrose (10% sucrose, 8% metrizamide, 1 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Tween 20, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 7000 ×g for 60 min. The radioactivity associated with the pellet and total homogenate was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Protein degradation was determined as reported previously (14Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.-J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). HT-29 cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C with 0.2 μCi/ml of l-[14C]valine. Unincorporated radioisotope was removed by three rinses with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Cells were then incubated in nutrient-free medium (without amino acids and in absence of fetal calf serum) supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm cold valine. When required 10 mm 3-MA was added throughout the chase period. After the first hour of incubation, at which time short-lived proteins were being degraded, the medium was replaced with the appropriate fresh medium and the incubation continued for an additional 4 h. Cells were scraped into 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and the radiolabeled proteins in the 4-h medium and cells precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid, 1% phosphotungstic acid (v/v) at 4 °C. The precipitated proteins were separated from the soluble radioactivity by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min and then dissolved in 1 ml of Soluene 350. The rate of protein degradation was calculated as acid-soluble radioactivity recovered from both cells and media. Recombinant hexahistidine-tagged GAIP and Gαi3 proteins were both produced by overexpression in Escherichia coli and purified by chromatography as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” The ability of recombinant GAIP to interact with the Gαi3protein was shown by in vitro experiments after its addition to HT-29 cell homogenates. The Gαi3 protein was identified by immunoblotting. As shown previously (7Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) the interaction between GAIP and the Gαi3 protein was observed in the presence of GDP + AlF4− (Fig.1 A), which induces a conformation of Gα proteins mimicking the transition state leading to GTP hydrolysis (19Sondek J. Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 372: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed by a mirror experiment using the recombinant Gαi3 protein and HT-29 cell homogenates. Again when AlF4− was added together with GDP, a band with similar electrophoretical mobility of GAIP was observed (Fig.1 A). The slight difference in mobility between recombinant GAIP and the endogenous GAIP could be due to the hexahistidine tag present at the amino terminus of the recombinant protein. This difference is hardly detectable with the recombinant and endogenous Gαi3 proteins, a fact probably due to their higher molecular mass. Next we examined the effect of GAIP on the catalytic rate of GTP hydrolysis by the Gαi3 protein. In agreement with previous reports (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 7Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), GAIP accelerates the intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis by the Gαi3 protein when the dissociation of GDP was not rate-limiting (Fig. 1 B). Results reported above clearly show that GAIP cloned from HT-29 cells has identical properties to that cloned from HeLa cells (4De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and lung (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). As HT-29 cells are derived from human intestine, we have investigated the expression of GAIP mRNA in this tissue. Whatever the segment considered (from duodenum to colon), a mRNA of ≈1.6 kilobases is equally distributed along the cephalo-caudal axis. These results show that the intestine belongs to the family of human tissues that express GAIP (4De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Beside cephalo-caudal differentiation, intestine is characterized by a differentiation along the crypt-to-villus axis. The human colon cancer cell line Caco-2 has been shown to mimic the crypt-to-villus differentiation in many instances. During the exponential phase of growth Caco-2 cells (days 5–10) are undifferentiated, whereas after late confluence these cells (days 20–30) express morphological and biochemical critera of enterocytic differentiation (16Ogier-Denis E. Blais A. Houri J.-J. Voisin T. Trugnan G. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4285-4290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pinto M. Robine-Léon S. Appay M.D. Kedinger M. Triadou N.

Trugnan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4824-4833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.2 A clearly shows that the content of the GAIP mRNA decreases during the differentiation of Caco-2 cells. Conversely the expression of the Gαi3protein does not change during this process (data not shown). The HT-29 cell line is another model with which to study enterocytic differentiation (22Pinto M. Appay M.D. Simon-Assmann P. Chevalier G. Dracopoli N. Fogh J. Zweibaum A. Biol. Cell. 1982; 44: 193-196Google Scholar, 23Zweibaum A. Pinto M. Chevalier G. Dussaulx E. Triadou N. Lacroix B. Haffen K. Brun J.L. Rousset M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1985; 122: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). When cultured in the absence of glucose and in the presence of inosine HT-29 cells express, after confluence, a typical enterocytic differentiation (17Wice B.M. Trugnan G. Pinto M. Rousset M.

Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 405-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), whereas the population grown in the presence of glucose mainly constitutes undifferentiated cells (25Lesuffleur T. Kornowski A. Luccioni C. Muleris M. Barbat A. Beaumatin J. Dussaulx E. Dutrillaux B. Zweibaum A. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 49: 721-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Here again GAIP mRNA was less abundant in differentiated cells than in undifferentiated cells, whereas the expression of the Gαi3 protein is not differentiation-dependent (13Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A major metabolic difference between differentiated and undifferentiated HT-29 cells is the rate of lysosomal-auptohagic degradation, which has been shown to be very active in undifferentiated cells (18Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. De Stefanis D. Bauvy C. Baccino F.M. Isidoro C. Codogno P. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition we have shown that the sequestration step, i.e. the first step of the lysosomal-autophagic pathway, is controlled by a Gi3protein (13Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As we have previously developed several HT-29 cell populations overexpressing either the wild type or mutants of the Gαi3 protein (13Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.-J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we have taken the opportunity to investigate the relationship between GAIP expression and Gαi3 expression and activity. No difference in the expression of GAIP mRNA was detected as a function of Gαi3 protein expression (Fig. 2 B, left panel, lane 1 versus lane 3). In contrast we observed a sharp decrease in GAIP mRNA content in cells expressing the Q204LGαi3protein (Fig. 2 B, left panel, lane 2), a mutant that is defective in GTPase activity. If this decrease in GAIP expression is related to the blockade in the GDP/GTP cycle on the Gαi3protein, we reasoned that modulation of the expression of GAIP would also be observed by freezing the GDP/GTP cycle by treating HT-29 cells by PTX, which ADP-ribosylates Gαi proteins. ADP-ribosylation of Gi proteins by PTX, which is most efficient when the αi-subunit is coupled to βγ (26Moss J. Vaughan M. Adv. Enzymol. 1988; 61: 303-379PubMed Google Scholar), blocks the interaction of the α-subunits of Gi proteins with their receptors and consequently prevents the receptor-mediated exchange of GDP for GTP (27Murayma T. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3319-3326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 18 h of PTX treatment we observed a decrease in the content of GAIP mRNA in HT-29 cells transfected with the cDNA encoding GAIP (Fig. 2 B, right panel, lanes 4 and 6) when compared with untransfected cells. As HT-29 cells contain two PTX-sensitive Gαi proteins (13Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Gαi2 and Gαi3), we analyzed the expression of GAIP in cells expressing the C351SGαi3 protein insensitive to PTX (14Ogier-Denis E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 29565-29570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 B the content of GAIP mRNA in C351SGαi3 protein-expressing cells was similar before and after PTX treatment (Fig. 2 B, right panel, lanes 1 and2). In some conditions we observed the presence of a higher molecular weight band (3.5–4.5 kilobases) as described previously (4De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Our previous studies have shown that the macroautophagic pathway is dependent upon the activity of the Gi3 protein in HT-29 cells (13Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.-J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To study the relationship between GAIP expression and the activity of macroautophagy we have measured the autophagic sequestration of [3H]raffinose and degradation of long-lived [14C]valine-labeled proteins in HT-29 cells transfected with an expression vector containing the cDNA encoding GAIP either in the sense or the antisense orientations. When HT-29 cells were transfected with the sense GAIP cDNA (Fig.3), we observed a stimulation of the 3-MA-sensitive degradation of radiolabeled proteins (3-MA: a potent inhibitor of macroautophagic sequestration (29Seglen P.O. Gordon P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1889-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1177) Google Scholar)) and a stimulation of [3H]raffinose sequestration (TableI). In cells transfected with the antisense GAIP cDNA, the expression of GAIP mRNA was reduced by ∼80% when compared with untransfected cells (Table I). Autophagic capacities (sequestration and degradation) were also greatly reduced in cells transfected with the antisense GAIP cDNA when compared with parental cells (Fig. 3 and Table I).Table IEffect of the modulation of GAIP expression on autophagic sequestration of [3H]raffinose in HT-29 cellsCell populationExpression vectorGAIP expression1-aAfter densitometry analysis the ratio GAIP mRNA/G3PDH mRNA was calculated in all of the cell populations considered.

Open table in a new tab In contrast to the results reported above, overexpression of GAIP did not increase either the low rate of autophagic proteolysis (Fig. 3) or sequestration (Table I) reported previously (14Ogier-Denis E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) in cells expressing a Gαi3 protein deficient in GTPase activity (Q204LGαi3). This last result suggests that GAIP is unable to restore the GTPase activity of the Q204LGαi3protein in a cellular environment. This observation is in line with the fact that in vitro GAIP did not restore the GTP hydrolysis by either the Q204LGαi1 protein (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) or Q204LGαi3protein. 2E. Ogier-Denis, A. Petiot, C. Bauvy, and P. Codogno, unpublished results. Using reverse transcription-PCR we have cloned from intestinal cells the cDNA encoding GAIP, a protein that was originally cloned from HeLa cells and shown to interact with the Gαi3protein (4De Vries L.

In our hands recombinant GAIP has identical properties to that described earlier: GAIP is a GTPase activating protein (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 7Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), and preferentially interacts with the GDP + AlF4− over the GDP-bound form of Gαi3 (7Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that GAIP is a regulator of the Gi3protein-dependent macroautophagic pathway (13Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The observation that overexpression of GAIP stimulates the macroautophagic pathway in HT-29 cells is consistent with the fact that GAIP, which acts as a GTPase-activating proteins, shortens the duration of the GTP bound state of the Gαi3 protein (5Berman D.M. Wilkie T.M. Gilman A.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 445-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 7Watson N. Linder M.E. Druey K.M. Kehrl J.H. Blumer K.J. Nature. 1996; 383: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) and is consistent with our previous data showing that the GTP-bound form of the Gαi3 protein inhibits autophagic sequestration (14Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.-J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In contrast when GAIP was down-expressed by antisense transfection, the macroautophagic pathway was greatly impaired. These results show unambiguously that GAIP is an essential element in the control of the Gi3-dependent macroautophagic pathway in HT-29 cells. Several properties associated either with the GAIP gene (early response gene) or the polypeptide (potential phosphorylation sites) suggest that GAIP could be a fine tuner of the lysosomal-autophagic pathway (4De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), which has to be rapidly modulated in response to extracellular stimuli (30Mortimore G.E. Kadowaki M. Ciechanover A.J. Schwartz A.L. Cellular Proteolytic Systems. Wiley-Liss, New York1994: 65-87Google Scholar). In fact the inhibition of the GDP/GTP cycle on the Gi3 protein influences the GAIP mRNA content of cells. A down-expression of GAIP mRNA is observed either when the Gαi3 protein is locked in its GTP bound form (the Q204L mutant) or restricted to its trimeric GDP-bound form (PTX treatment). This last effect is specifically associated with the nucleotide binding state of the Gi3 protein, as no modification of the content of GAIP mRNA is observed in cells expressing a mutant form of the Gαi3 protein insensitive to PTX. At the moment we cannot conclude whether or not the mRNA content is controlled at the transcriptional or at the post-transcriptional level. However we can exclude a contribution of the lysosomal-autophagic pathway in lowering the mRNA content of Q204L-expressing and PTX-treated cells, as the macroautophagic pathway is greatly reduced in these two cell populations (13Ogier-Denis E. Couvineau A. Maoret J.J. Houri J.J. Bauvy C. De Stefanis D. Isidoro C. Laburthe M. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 14Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.-J. Bauvy C. Codogno P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28593-28600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the GAIP mRNA level is lower in differentiated HT-29 cells (low autophagic capacity) than in undifferentiated cells (high autophagic capacity). In Caco-2 cells, where the autophagic capacity is lower than in HT-29 cells (data not shown), we have also observed that the level of GAIP mRNA decreases during cell differentiation. From these results it seems that the control of the expression of GAIP may depend upon Gi3 protein activation and cell differentiation. Whether or not these two parameters are directly related remains to be determined. However the GAIP mRNA content does not change when the expression of the Gαi3 protein is increased by transfection in HT-29 cells. This result is in line with data showing that the level of Gα protein expression in yeast does not modify the expression of Sst2 protein (9Dohlman H.G. Song J. Ma D. Courchesne W.E. Thorner J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5194-5209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is structurally and functionally related to GAIP (4De Vries L. Mousli M. Wurmser A. Farquhar M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11916-11920Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and RGS proteins (11Druey K.M. Blumer K.J. Kang V.H. Kehrl J.H. Nature. 1996; 379: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Similarly the decrease in GAIP mRNA content during the enterocytic differentiation of Caco-2 and HT-29 cells is not correlated with changes of the Gαi3 protein expression. Several studies have shown that protein phosphorylation is involved in the control of the macroautophagic pathway (for a review, see Ref. 31Codogno P. Ogier-Denis E. Houri J.J. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For example okadaic acid and other phosphatase inhibitors inhibit autophagic sequestration in liver cells (32Holen I. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 33Holen I. Gordon P.B. Seglen P.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have reported a similar effect of okadaic acid in HT-29 cells (34Houri J.J. Ogier-Denis E. Trugnan G. Codogno P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 197: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However the phosphorylated proteins, as well as the transduction pathways involved in the control of macroautophagic sequestration, remain largely unknown. Recently it has been suggested that the phosphorylation of the ribosomal S6 protein by the p70S6 kinase inhibits macroautophagic sequestration in liver cells (35Blommaart E.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 2320-2326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and HT-29 cells.2 It is conceivable that GAIP, which possesses several potential phosphorylation sites, could be the target of a transduction pathway emanating from the cell surface following hormonal or amino acid signaling (36Miotto G. Venerando R. Marin O. Siliprandi N. Mortimore G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25348-25353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies will be required to show whether or not changes in phosphorylation of GAIP can regulate the macroautophagic pathway. We thank Dr. R.

DNA sequences able to form G4-DNA have also been found at sites of spontaneous gene rearrangements, point mutations and, along with triplex DNA, have been implicated in causing DNA mutations (9Sen D.

The identification of a G4-DNA-specific nuclease from yeast as the SEP1/KEM1 protein, and the meiotic block at the 4N stage for KEM1-null cells, supports the hypothesis that G4-DNA is involved in meiosis (23Lui Z.

More recently, two yeast gene products with specific activity for G4-DNA were cloned and sequenced, G4p1 and G4p2 (19Frantz J.D. Gilbert W. J. Biol.

G4p1 is a homodimer of the gene encoding a novel protein with a domain homologous to the bacterial methionyl-tRNA synthetase dimerization domains, and G4p2 is encoded by a gene identical to genes that appear to function in protein kinase-controlled signal transduction, MPT4, and cell cycle progression, STO1 (19Frantz J.D.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13714-13718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The abundance of DNA sequences that have the ability to form G4-DNA and the possible link between G4-DNA, meiosis, transcription, and mutagenesis provide evidence not only for the formation of G4-DNA in vivo, but also for these high order DNA structures to play important roles in cellular metabolism. In this paper we describe a novel G4-DNA metabolizing activity identified in human placental tissue. This activity is able to resolve four-stranded G4-DNA to single-stranded DNA. The activity was identified using G4-DNA formed from PZ33 as a substrate. PZ33 is an oligonucleotide (5′-AAAGTGATGGTGGTGGGGGAAGGATTCGAACCT-3′) with a nucleotide sequence that was identified as a hot spot for H2O2/Fe-mediated mutations in thesupF gene of the reporter plasmid pZ189 (16Akman S.A.

Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and that has previously been shown to form G4-DNA in the presence of Na+ (16Akman S.A. Lingeman T.G. Doroshow J.H. Smith S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the strand orientation of PZ33 in the G4-DNA form is not known with certainty, similar sequences have been documented to form parallel-stranded G4-DNA in the presence of Na+ (9Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar)· We have purified this activity from any contaminating nuclease, helicase, or topoisomerase II activities and have shown its optimal conditions along with its dependence on dNTP hydrolysis. This activity provides further evidence for the biological importance of G4-DNA, along with a potential mechanism for cells to handle bulky G4-DNA complexes that could disrupt DNA metabolic processes such as replication and transcription. Radiolabeled ATP was from Amersham. T4 polynucleotide kinase was from Promega. The unlabeled dNTPs (ultrapure grade), DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, Sephacryl S-200, and the Superdex-200 HR column were from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.

Hydroxylapatite resin and chelex-100 were from Bio-Rad. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized in the Cancer Center of Wake Forest University. Placental tissue was obtained from Forsyth County Hospital in Winston-Salem, NC. Escherichia coli DNA helicase II was a generous gift from Dr. Steven Matson (University of North Carolina). Human topoisomerase II and the topoisomerase II assay kit were from TopoGEN (Columbus, Ohio). G4-DNA was prepared by a modified method ofAkman et al. 1991 (16Akman S.A. Lingeman T.G. Doroshow J.H. Smith S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The G4 complex was formed by incubating 180 pmol/μl PZ33 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl at 100 °C for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 0 °C, and then 55 °C for 16 h. The DNA was electrophoresed on a 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at 4 °C and visualized by UV shadowing. The band containing G4-DNA was cut from the gel, and the DNA was electroeluted into TBE buffer (89 mm Tris-base, 89 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. The gel purification was repeated a second time to give a solution of DNA containing greater than 90% of the total DNA in the G4 conformation. Marker DNAs were poly(dT) oligonucleotides of 36, 30, and 26 bases in length and a 5-mer (5′-AAAGT-3′). The M13/17-mer duplex helicase substrate was prepared by hybridizing 1 pmol of 5′-32P-labeled Stratagene −40 primer to ssM13mp9 in a 1:10 primer template ratio. The DNA was then passed through a Sephacryl S-200 spin column. The M13/37-mer tailed helicase substrate was prepared in the same manner with the 37-mer primer (5′-ATTGCGGTCCGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACCACTTTTG-3′) being hybridized to the ssM13mp9 DNA. The catenated kDNA used for topoisomerase II assays was purchased from TopoGEN. The oligonucleotides used for preparation of triplex DNA were kindly supplied by Michael M. Seidman (Oncorpharm, Gaithersburg, MD). Triplex DNA was prepared using 5′-32P- labeled Y37 hybridized in a 1:1.5 ratio to R37 as duplex DNA. The TC32 oligonucleotide was then bound to the 32P-Y37/R37 duplex by incubation overnight at 25 °C in triplex buffer (50 mmTris-acetate, 5 mm Mg-acetate, pH 7.5, see Fig. 7). Reactions were in 50 mmTris-acetate, pH 7.8, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm BME, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm ATP, and 5 mm MgCl2 unless otherwise indicated. The 5′-32P-labeled G4-DNA was incubated with the resolvase activity at 37 °C for 30 min unless otherwise indicated. Reactions containing crude extract were extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol prior to addition of stop buffer. Other reactions were stopped by addition of stop buffer to a final concentration of 0.01% SDS, 15% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and 0.01% xylene cyanol. 2–5 μl of each reaction was electrophoresed at 4 °C through a 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Images were obtained and quantified on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The percent G4-DNA resolved was calculated from (ssDNA)/(ssDNA + G4 DNA) × 100 with the background value from the negative control subtracted. All steps were at 4 °C. 260 g of placental tissue were cut into small pieces and homogenized in a Waring blender in 260 ml of 2 × buffer A (100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 20% glycerol, 0.4 mmEDTA, 40 mm BME, 0.02% Triton X-100, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml pepstatin). The homogenate was spun at 3000 ×g to pellet debris. The 350 ml of supernatant (crude extract) was subject to a 0–30% ammonium sulfate precipitation. The pelleted protein was resuspended in 80 ml of buffer A plus 10 mm KPi, pH 7.8, and dialyzed against the same buffer (fraction I). The 96 ml of fraction I were mixed with 100 ml of hydroxylapatite resin, equilibrated in buffer A plus 10 mmKPi, pH 7.8, and stirred for 30 min. The resin was pelleted by spinning at 5000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was removed, and the resin was washed with another 100 ml of buffer A plus 10 mm KPi, pH 7.8, in the same manner. Resolvase activity was eluted from the hydroxylapatite resin by stirring the resin in buffer A plus 0.5 m KPi, pH 7.8, and pelleting the resin as described above. The supernatant was kept and dialyzed into buffer A in the presence of Chelex-100, yielding 138 ml of fraction II. Fraction II was loaded onto a 20-ml DEAE-Sepharose column that was equilibrated in buffer A. The column was eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient from 0 to 0.5 m NaCl in buffer A and then washed with another 50 ml of 0.5 mNaCl in buffer A. Resolvase activity eluted from the DEAE column in 2 peaks, an early broad peak and a second sharp peak that eluted at 0.5m NaCl. Fractions in the second peak were pooled and dialyzed into buffer A plus 100 mm NaCl (fraction III). Fraction III was the first fraction that did not contain any detectable nuclease activity at the optimal MgCl2 concentration of 5 mm (see Fig. 1). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of activity that resolves 50% of 0.1 pmol G4-DNA to ssDNA in 30 min at 37 °C in a 30-μl resolvase reaction with 0.5 mmMgCl2. Since the crude extract, fraction I, and fraction II contain contaminating nuclease activity, the purification obtained can only be estimated at 100-fold. However, 6.5 ml of fraction III (1.2 units/μl, 1.17 mg/ml) were recovered and used for characterization of the resolvase activity. Resolvase reactions containing 1.2 units of activity, 0.1 pmol G4-DNA, 0.4 mm MgCl2, and increasing concentrations of ATP, GTP, and dATP were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The percent G4-DNA resolved was determined as described above and plotted verses the concentration of NTP. The data were fit to a Michaelis-Menten curve by nonlinear regression using Kaliedagraph (Abelbeck Software). The apparent V max andK m were determined for each nucleotide cofactor. Gel filtration was done at 4 °C using a Superdex-200 HR column equilibrated in buffer A containing 0.5 m NaCl. 100 μl of protein standards (0.1 mg/ml ferritin (440 kDa), 1 mg/ml catalase (232 kDa), 1 mg/ml aldolase (158 kDa), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), 1 mg/ml ovalbumin (43 kDa), and 0.1 mg/ml blue dextran) were injected onto the column and the positions of elution followed by A 280. 100 μl of protein extract (concentrated from fraction III) containing 480 units of resolvase activity were loaded onto the column, and 0.25-ml fractions were collected and assayed for resolvase activity. The ability of many chromosomal DNA sequences to form G4-DNA has led to the search for different cellular proteins that metabolize this high order DNA structure. We have identified a resolvase activity from human placenta tissue with the ability to resolve four-stranded G4-DNA to single-stranded DNA. The activity was identified by incubating protein extracts with G4-DNA in the presence of ATP and MgCl2. The resolvase activity was visualized on 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels by following the conversion of the slow migrating 32P-labeled four-stranded G4-DNA structure to a faster migrating form of DNA that is single-stranded DNA (ssPZ33). Titrating MgCl2 into resolvase assays with crude extracts shows that the four-stranded DNA (G4-DNA) becomes single-stranded (ssPZ33) as the MgCl2 concentration is increased from 0 to 0.2 mm (Fig.1, lanes 10–14), but with higher concentrations of MgCl2 contaminating nuclease activity exists, resulting in a small product migrating slightly faster than the 5-mer marker DNA (Fig. 1, lanes 15–18). Marker DNAs were run in Fig. 1, lane 20. Fraction III has been purified from any detectable nuclease activity (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) and has increasing resolvase activity with increasing concentrations of MgCl2 and maximal activity at 5 mm (Fig. 1,lanes 2–9). The resolvase activity is inhibited by EDTA and by proteinase K, indicating that it is dependent on the presence of protein and a divalent cation (results not shown). The resolvase activity has been partially purified using a 0–30% ammonium sulfate precipitation (fraction I), hydroxylapatite resin (fraction II), and DEAE chromatography (fraction III). To investigate whether the resolvase reaction may be a physiological catalytic reaction, the rate of the reaction was determined at five temperatures, 25, 30, 37, 42, and 55 °C (Fig. 2.). At each of these temperatures, the rate of the reaction was linear for 25 min. The rate of the reaction at 37 °C was 2.1% G4-DNA resolved/min. At 42 °C, the reaction had a very similar rate of 2.3% resolved/min. The rate of the reaction was one-half of the maximal rate at 30 °C, 1.1% G4-DNA resolved/min, and was considerably slower at both 25 °C and 55 °C. These data indicate that resolvase activity is sensitive to temperature and that the optimal reaction temperature is in the range of 37–42 °C. The ability of helicases to unwind duplex DNA requires NTP hydrolysis. We show that the resolvase reaction is dependent on the presence of a NTP (Fig. 3, lane 4), and incubation of fraction III with the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide analog, ATPγS, inhibits the resolvase reaction (Fig. 3,lane 3). With increased concentrations of ATPγS added to resolvase reactions with 5 mm ATP, a decrease in the amount of ssDNA product was seen (Fig. 3,lanes 6–10). With equal concentrations of ATP and ATPγS, a 50% inhibition of resolvase activity was seen (Fig.3, lane 10). This indicates that the resolvase activity is dependent on NTP hydrolysis. The apparent kinetics of the resolvase reaction with ATP, dATP, and GTP were examined to determine the cofactor preference of this activity (Table I). The apparentK m and V max values were determined by quantifying the reaction products at increasing concentrations of NTP. The percent G4-DNA resolved was plotted against the concentration of NTP, and the data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The apparent K m values for ATP and dATP were similar, 220 and 150 μm, but the value for GTP was higher, 1900 μm. The apparent V maxvalues were again similar for ATP and dATP, 12 and 3.4%/30 min, but the V max was higher for GTP, 28%/30 min. These values give rate constants (V max/K m) that are a measure of the efficiency of the reaction in the presence of each cofactor. The resolvase activity is most efficient with ATP, 0.055%/30 min/μm, followed by dATP and then GTP, with rate constants of 0.023 and 0.015%/30 min/μm, respectively. A low amount of resolvase activity was seen with dGTP, TTP, and UTP, whereas neither dCTP nor CTP could act as cofactors for the resolvase activity (data not shown).Table IKinetics of resolving G4-DNA to ssDNA in the presence of different deoxynucleotide triphosphate cofactorsdNTPK mV maxRate constantRelative frequencyμm%/30 min%/30 min/μmATP220 ± 6012 ± 10.0551dATP150 ± 403.4 ± 0.30.0231/2.4GTP1900 ± 80028 ± 50.0151/3.7Resolvase reactions were performed with 0.2 pmol of 5′32P-labeled G4-DNA and 0.3 units of fraction III.

Rate constants are fromV max/K m. Frequencies are relative to the resolvase reaction in the presence of ATP. There are at least two different ways by which the four-stranded G4 complexes can be separated into ssDNA. The resolvase activity may unwind the G4-DNA in an energy-dependent helicase-type mechanism or alternatively may act through a mechanism similar to DNA repair proteins altering the guanine base to release the Hoogsteen bonding. To further explore the mechanism of the resolvase reaction, products of the resolvase reactions were analyzed by chemical sequencing to determine if the DNA bases were modified during the reaction. The32P-labeled resolved G4-DNA, intact G4-DNA, and ssPZ33 DNA were isolated from a 12% polyacrylamide gel and used in Maxam and Gilbert chemical sequencing reactions (25Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). In the G4-DNA the run of five guanosine residues that are involved in the Hoogsteen bonding were protected from methylation at N7 and were therefore not cleaved in the G reactions (Fig. 4, lane 2and Ref. 16Akman S.A. Lingeman T.G. Doroshow J.H. Smith S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, the resolved G4-DNA sequenced identical to the ssPZ33 DNA, indicating that the N7 positions were no longer protected (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 3). The bands generated from the sequencing reactions for both the ssPZ33 DNA and the resolved G4-DNA migrated identically through the denaturing polyacrylamide gel, indicating that the resolved DNA does not seem to be modified. The resolved G4-DNA was not cleaved by piperidine alone, indicating that it does not contain any abasic sites (data not shown). Also, 1000-fold excess ssDNA did not inhibit the reaction, suggesting it is not simply a ssDNA binding protein shifting the equilibrium toward the single-stranded form of DNA (data not shown). These results imply that the resolvase activity is a helicase-like activity and does not use a repair type of mechanism involving modification of the DNA. A DNA unwinding reaction that is dependent on dNTP hydrolysis and a divalent cation has the potential to be a classical DNA helicase activity with a preferred substrate of duplex DNA. It has been shown that the dda protein of bacteriophage T4 can unwind triplex DNA (26Maine I.P. Kodadek T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and SV40 T-antigen can unwind triplex DNA at pH 8.7 but not at pH 6.9 (27Peleg M. Kopel V. Borowiec J.A. Manor H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1292-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although, triplex DNA is a Hoogsteen-bonded structure similar in some aspects to G4-DNA, there have been no reports of these helicases unwinding G4-DNA. We tested the ability of the resolvase activity to unwind two different helicase substrates, an M13/17-mer, which contains a 17-nucleotide length of duplex DNA on ssM13 phage DNA, and an M13/37-mer, which again has 17 bases of duplex DNA but has 10 bases on both the 3′ and 5′ ends that are noncomplementary to the ssM13 template creating both 5′ and 3′ single-stranded tails. Using 1.2 units of resolvase activity (an amount that is within the linear range of the resolvase reaction), neither of the helicase substrates were unwound (Fig.5, lanes 4, 7, and10). Whereas, 1 μg of E. coli helicase II unwound both the M13/17-mer and M13/37-mer but not the G4-DNA (Fig.5,lanes 5, 8, and 11). These data indicate resolvase is not a duplex DNA helicase activity but is an activity that prefers the G4-DNA structure. Topoisomerase II is necessary for cellular DNA replication and maintenance of chromosomal DNA structure (28Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., San Francisco1992: 379-401Google Scholar). Topoisomerase II acts in a sequence-specific manner and may be involved in chromosome segregation during meiosis (29Rose D. Thomas W. Holm C. Cell. 1990; 60: 1009-1017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It has been shown that eukaryotic topoisomerase II cleaves G4-DNA and not duplex DNA containing the same nucleotide sequence (30Chung I.K. Mehta V.B. Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1973-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We addressed the question of whether resolvase activity separated the G4-DNA to ssDNA in a topoisomerase II catalyzed reaction. Topoisomerase II activity can be followed by its unique ability to decantenate kDNA. Resolvase activity was not able to decantenate kDNA (Fig. 6,lanes 5 and 8), whereas human topoisomerase II does decantenate the kDNA (Fig. 6,lane 4). This indicates that resolvase activity is not the product of topoisomerase II cleavage and ligation of the G4-DNA. Because triplex DNA is also a form of Hoogsteen-bonded DNA that has been implicated in mutagenesis (14Wang G. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), the ability of the G4-DNA resolvase to unwind triplex DNA was tested (Fig.7). Triplex DNA was made by incubating increasing concentrations of TC32 with the 32P R37/Y37 duplex DNA for 16 h at 25 °C (Fig. 7 B, lanes 3–6). As an increasing concentration of the TC32 oligonucleotide is added to the binding reactions, an increase in the slowly migrating triplex form DNA is seen. The ability of the G4-DNA resolvase activity to unwind triplex DNA was tested by incubating 1.2 units of fraction III with triplex DNA at 37 °C for 30 min (Fig. 7 C, lane 5). There is no detectable double- or single-stranded DNA formed upon incubation of triplex DNA with fraction III indicating that the resolvase activity does not unwind triplex DNA. These reactions were carried out with 100 nm triplex DNA in triplex binding buffer plus 5 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm ATP. Triplex DNA is not stable at 37 °C under the reaction conditions that give maximal resolvase activity (see resolvase assays under “Experimental Procedures”); however, control reactions with G4-DNA as a substrate were done in both the triplex buffer and the G4-DNA resolvase buffer. Fraction III demonstrated low G4-DNA resolvase activity in the triplex buffer plus MgCl2 and ATP and typical activity in the G4-DNA resolvase buffer (data not shown). These data indicate that the resolvase activity does not merely recognize Hoogsteen-bonded DNA structure but is specific for the G4 structure. Several other proteins have been identified that bind G4-DNA, with some implicated in facilitating the formation of G4-DNA and others in stabilizing the G4-DNA (18Weisman-Shomer P. Fry M. J. Biol.

To date only topoisomerase II and the nuclease activity of KEM1/SEP1 have been shown to act on G4-DNA in a manner that may remove the stable G4 structures from DNA (17Lui Z. Frantz J.D. Gilbert W. Tye B.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3157-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 30Chung I.K. Mehta V.B. Spitzner J.R. Muller M.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1973-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that the resolvase activity is a novel activity that may remove the high order G4-DNA structure to allow for normal DNA metabolism to occur. Resolvase activity from Fraction III was subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 200-HR column to assess its native molecular mass (Fig.8). The column was run in the presence of 500 mm NaCl to disrupt nonspecific protein or nucleic acid associations with the activity. The apparent native molecular mass of the activity was determined using protein standards of ferritin, catalase, aldolase, bovine serum albumin, and ovalbumin, which were also run in the presence of 500 mm NaCl. The peak of resolvase activity eluted in fractions 48–50 (Fig. 8,lanes 7–9), indicating an apparent native molecular mass between 200 and 230 kDa. We have identified a novel G4-DNA resolvase activity that resolves G4-DNA into ssDNA and have begun to address the mechanism by which the protein-dependent activity proceeds. The presence of many DNA sequences with the ability to form G4-DNA and the identification of different proteins that specifically interact with G4-DNA are support for the presence of G4-DNA in vivo (1Blackburn E.H.

G4-DNA has been implicated in having effects on meiosis, recombination, telomere stability, and perhaps mutagenesis (6Sundquist W.I. Klug A.

A. 1994; 91: 7658-7662Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The formation of G4-DNA may be advantageous for some cellular processes, for example meiosis. But in other instances, such as DNA replication and transcription, it has the potential to be problematic to the cell. Chromosome separation may be a physiologic role of the G4-DNA resolvase. In both meiosis and telomere-telomere recombination, an interaction of four helices through quadruplex formation has been proposed to bring together guanine-rich DNA sequences (9Sen D. Gilbert W. Nature. 1988; 334: 364-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1425) Google Scholar). The SEP1/KEM1 protein cleaves the DNA on the 5′ side of the G4 structure and may be needed for the chromatids to separate and move to the opposite poles during anaphase (17Lui Z. Frantz J.D. Gilbert W. Tye B.-K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3157-3161Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The resolvase activity may also facilitate the separation of the guanine tetrad to allow for the cell cycle to proceed. Alternatively, telomeres keep their size by lengthening and shortening in small increments within upper and lower boundaries with the telomere length related to chromosome stability (34Shampay J. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 534-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, telomerase cannot bind to G4-DNA structures in vitro (35Fang G. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11646-11657Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A G4-DNA metabolizing activity may be necessary to remove G4-DNA from the linear ends of the chromosomes and provide ssDNA that is substrate for the telomerase, thus allowing the length of the telomeres to be kept in equilibrium. G4-DNA resolvase also may play a role in replication and/or transcription with the formation of G4-DNA under physiological conditions providing a potential block to the replication and/or transcription machinery. This is supported by both the stimulation of transcription-coupled repair by Hoogsteen-bonded triplex DNA and the identification of quadruplex DNA formation by a DNA sequence associated with a mutational hot spot (14Wang G. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 16Akman S.A. Lingeman T.G. Doroshow J.H. Smith S.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8648-8653Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There is an abundance of chromosomal DNA sequences with the ability to form G4-DNA that may need to be unwound by an activity like resolvase to allow the genome to maintain its integrity. G4-DNA resolvase does not unwind duplex DNA substrates at a protein concentration that G4-DNA structures are unwound (Figs. 4 and 5), and the resolvase activity is not inhibited by 1000-fold excess single-stranded DNA (data not shown). These data indicate the resolvase activity seems to specifically recognize the Hoogsteen-bonded G4-DNA and separate the four strands of DNA in an energy-dependent helicase type of mechanism. The activity is specific for the G4 structure as it does not unwind Hoogsteen-bonded triplex DNA. It may also resolve G4-RNA, a structure that is formed in the dimerization domain of HIV RNA (2Awang G. Sen G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11453-11457Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 3Sundquist W.I. Heaphy S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.A. 1993; 90: 3393-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The existence of a G4-DNA resolvase in human cells provides further evidence for G4-DNA having physiological importance and suggests that the resolvase activity may be important for cell survival.

These studies demonstrate the general utility of generating chimeric fusion proteins to examine receptor regulation of G protein function and that the lack of functional activation of acylation-negative G proteins by a co-expressed receptor is related to deficiencies in cellular targeting and location rather than an inherent incapacity to produce appropriate protein-protein interactions and signal transmission.

A major mechanism for signal transduction across the plasma membrane involves seven transmembrane element G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; G protein, guanine nucleotide binding protein; UK14304, 5-bromo-N-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine; ORF, open reading frame; bp, base pair(s).1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; G protein, guanine nucleotide binding protein; UK14304, 5-bromo-N-(4,5-dihydro-1H-imidazol-2-yl)-6-quinoxalinamine; ORF, open reading frame; bp, base pair(s). and their activation of members of the family of αβγ heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) (1Gilman A.G.

Unlike the GPCRs, none of the individual G protein subunits contain transmembrane-spanning elements although the proteins are membrane-associated. In the case of the βγ complex, post-translational prenylation by the C15 farnesyl or C20 geranylgeranyl groups at a cysteine residue close to the C-terminal tail of the γ subunit followed by protein trimming and carboxymethylation acts to anchor the complex to the membrane (3Casey P.J.

These acylations may also contribute to protein-protein interactions between the G protein α subunit and both receptors and the G protein βγ complex (12Wedegaertner P.B. Chu D.H. Wilson P.T.

Addition of myristate occurs only on the α subunits of the Gi-family of G proteins because they contain the consensus sequence (MGXXXS) for the enzyme N-myristoyl-CoA transferase. The glycine that is found at codon 2 acts as the acceptor when it is exposed following removal of the initiator methionine. Palmitoylation of either one or two cysteine residues within the first ten amino acids of the α subunits occurs on all of the widely expressed G proteins (4Wedegaertner P.B. Wilson P.T. Bourne H.R.

Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Although receptors can often be resolved from their cognate G proteins by detergent solubilization of membranes, in a number of examples such solubilization of membranes can result in the maintenance of receptor-G protein contacts (15Richardson A. Demoliou-Mason C. Barnard E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10198-10202Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 16Tian W.-N. Duzic E. Lanier S.M. Deth R.C. Mol.

The term “precoupled” is often used to describe such avid interactions between receptors and their cognate G protein. As a strategy to create physical precoupling of a receptor and its cognate G protein α subunit, Bertin et al. (18Bertin B. Friessmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) linked together the β2-adrenoreceptor and Gsα by generating a fusion protein between these open reading frames. This construct could be expressed, and addition of agonist for the receptor resulted in stimulation of adenylyl cyclase activity (18Bertin B. Friessmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). We have recently expanded this approach to the α2A-adrenoreceptor and the inhibitory G protein Gi1α and demonstrated that the addition of agonist to a fusion protein containing the wild-type sequences of both proteins results in activation of the G protein (19Wise A. Carr I.C. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although independent co-expression of the α2A-adrenoreceptor and Gi1α in COS cells allows functional interactions between the receptor and this G protein (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), no functional contacts can be measured following co-expression of the α2A-adrenoreceptor and acylation-deficient mutants of Gi1α (21Wise, A., Grassie, M. A., Parenti, M., Lee, M., Rees, S., and Milligan, G. (1997) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar) even though at least a C3S mutant can be localized to the membrane. We now demonstrate that agonist-induced signal transduction to the acylation-deficient mutants of Gi1α can be rescued by expressing these polypeptides as fusion constructs with the receptor and that effective agonist-induced signal transduction is unaffected by the palmitoylation potential of the receptor. All materials for tissue culture were supplied by Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, Strathclyde, Scotland). [3H]RS-79948–197 (90 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham International. [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol) was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Pertussis toxin (240 μg/ml) was purchased from Speywood. All other chemicals were from Sigma or Fisons plc and were of the highest purity available. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Millipore Expedite Nucleic Acids Synthesis System. A pertussis toxin-resistant C351G form of rat Gi1α was generated (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and linked to the porcine α2A-adrenoreceptor (22Guyer C.A. Horstman D.A. Wilson A.L. Clark J.D. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17307-17317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To do so, the ORF of the α2A-adrenoreceptor DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the oligonucleotides: sense, 5′-TTGGTACCATGTATCCTTACGACGTTC-3′, and antisense, 5′-AAGAATTCCATGGCGATCCGTTTCCTGTCCCCACGGC-3′ (restriction sites for KpnI, EcoRI, and NcoI are underlined). The polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment was digested with KpnI and EcoRI and ligated to pBluescript (Stratagene) through these restriction sites. Introduction of the NcoI site at the 3′-end of the ORF resulted in the C-terminal amino acid of the receptor being altered from Val to Ala and removal of the stop codon. The rat C351G Gi1α cDNA contains two NcoI sites, one straddling the ATG start codon and the other 268 bp downstream from this. This 268-bp fragment was removed from C351G Gi1α in pBluescript by digestion withNcoI, and the remaining C351G Gi1α pBluescript cDNA was religated. The shortened cDNA was excised from pBluescript with EcoRI and cloned into the EcoRI site of the α2A-adrenoreceptor in pBluescript, adjacent to the 3′-end of the receptor ORF. The 268-bp fragment was then inserted between the NcoI sites at the 3′-end of the α2A-adrenoreceptor ORF and at the 5′-end of the C351G Gi1α ORF. This resulted in production of an in-frame construct whereby the 3′-end of the α2A-adrenoreceptor ORF was exactly adjacent to the 5′-end of the C351G Gi1α ORF. The full fusion construct was then excised from pBluescript withKpnI and EcoRI and ligated into the eukaryotic expression vector pCDNA3. The same strategy was used to generate the various acylation-deficient chimeras. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes and grown to 60–80% confluency (18–24 h) prior to transfection with pcDNA3 containing the relevant cDNA species using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). For transfection, 2.5–2.8 μg of DNA were mixed with 10 μl of LipofectAMINE in 0.2 ml of Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at room temperature for 30 min prior to the addition of 1.8 ml of Opti-MEM. COS-7 cells were exposed to the DNA/LipofectAMINE mixture for 5 h. 2 ml of 20% (v/v) fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were then added to the cells. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. In all studies, the cells were treated with pertussis toxin (25 ng/ml) 24 h prior to cell harvest to eliminate possible interactions of the fusion proteins with endogenously expressed Gi-family G proteins (19Wise A. Carr I.C. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Plasma membrane-containing P2 particulate fractions were prepared from cell pastes that had been stored at −80 °C following harvest. Cell pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (buffer A), and rupture of the cells was achieved with 50 strokes of a hand-held Teflon on-glass homogenizer followed by passage (10 times) through a 25-gauge needle. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min in a Beckman TJ-6 centrifuge to pellet the nuclei, and unbroken cells and P2 particulate fractions were then recovered by centrifugation of the supernatant at 200,000 ×g for 30 min in a Beckman TL 100 bench-top ultra-centrifuge using a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor. P2 particulate fractions were resuspended in buffer A and stored at −80 °C until required. Binding assays were initiated by the addition of 2–4 μg of protein to an assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 50 mm sucrose, 20 mm MgCl2, pH 7.5) containing [3H]RS-79948–197 (23Gillard N.P. Linton C.J. Milligan G. Carr I.C. Patmore L. Brown C.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 298PGoogle Scholar) (1 nm).K d for this ligand at the fusion protein derived from the wild-type receptor and G protein = 0.35 nm(20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 μm idazoxan. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 45 min, and bound ligand was separated from free by vacuum filtration through GF/C filters. The filters were washed 3 times with 5 ml of assay buffer, and bound ligand was estimated by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Antiserum I1C (24Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was produced in a New Zealand White rabbit using a conjugate of a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 160–169 of the Gi1α subunit and keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Calbiochem) as antigen. The specificity of this antiserum for Gi1α has been demonstrated previously (24Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane samples were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10% (w/v) acrylamide gels containing 6m urea overnight at 100 V. Proteins were subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), probed with relevant antiserum, and visualized as described (25McKenzie F.R. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). High affinity GTPase assays were performed essentially as described previously (26Koski G. Klee W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4185-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) using [γ-32P]GTP (0.5 μm, 60,000 cpm) and varying concentrations of UK14304 (up to 10 μm). Nonspecific GTPase was assessed by parallel assays containing 100 μm GTP. Expression of the porcine α2A-adrenoreceptor (22Guyer C.A. Horstman D.A. Wilson A.L. Clark J.D. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17307-17317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in COS-7 cells allows agonist activation of endogenously expressed G proteins as measured by the capacity of the α2-adrenoreceptor agonist UK14304 to stimulate high affinity GTPase activity in membranes of these cells (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin treatment prior to cell harvest attenuates this effect, demonstrating it to reflect activation of Gi-family G proteins (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A C351G mutation was introduced into Gi1α to render this protein insensitive to pertussis toxin (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Co-expression of this modified G protein with the α2A-adrenoreceptor in COS-7 cells, followed by treatment of the cells with pertussis toxin, now resulted in a robust stimulation of high affinity GTPase activity upon addition of UK14304 (Fig.1). A C3S mutation of Gi1α prevents this polypeptide from acting as a substrate for post-translational palmitoylation (9Galbiati F. Guzzi F. Magee A.I. Milligan G. Parenti M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 10Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30898-30903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Co-expression of C3S/C351G Gi1α and the α2A-adrenoreceptor failed to allow UK14304 stimulation of the GTPase activity of this mutated G protein (Fig. 1) although high levels of the G protein can be expressed in the membrane preparation (21Wise, A., Grassie, M. A., Parenti, M., Lee, M., Rees, S., and Milligan, G. (1997) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). A G2A mutation of Gi1α prevents co-translational myristoylation of this protein (5Mumby S.M. Heuckeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6Jones T.L.Z. Simonds W.F. Merendino J.J. Brann M.R. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and the combination of G2A and C3S mutations totally eliminates acylation of the expressed polypeptide (9Galbiati F. Guzzi F. Magee A.I. Milligan G. Parenti M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and prevents membrane attachment. Co-expression of these forms of Gi1α, which also contained the C351G mutation with the α2A-adrenoreceptor, did not result in UK14304 stimulation of high affinity GTPase activity (21Wise, A., Grassie, M. A., Parenti, M., Lee, M., Rees, S., and Milligan, G. (1997) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar) as they were virtually entirely cytosolic (data not shown, but see Ref. 21Wise, A., Grassie, M. A., Parenti, M., Lee, M., Rees, S., and Milligan, G. (1997) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). The open reading frames of each of C351G Gi1α, C3S/C351G Gi1α, G2A/C351G Gi1α, and G2A/C3S/C351G Gi1α were fused in-frame to the wild-type α2A-adrenoreceptor cDNA to create chimeric fusion proteins that contained the entire G protein α subunit sequence downstream of the receptor. This process introduced a single substitution of the receptor C-terminal Val by Ala and the maintained presence in the fusion proteins of the initiator Met of Gi1α (Fig. 2). Expression of each of these α2A-adrenoreceptor-C351G Gi1α constructs in COS-7 cells resulted in high levels of membrane expression of the receptor binding site (some 15–25 pmol/mg protein in individual transfections) as measured by the specific binding of the highly selective and high affinity α2-antagonist [3H]RS-79948–197 (23Gillard N.P. Linton C.J. Milligan G. Carr I.C. Patmore L. Brown C.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 298PGoogle Scholar). There were no differences in levels of expression of the individual fusion proteins in concurrently performed transfections (data not shown, but see Fig. 5). Immunoblotting membranes and cytosolic fractions derived from these transfections with the Gi1α specific antiserum I1C (24Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) resulted in identification of low levels of the endogenously expressed Gi1α as a 41-kDa polypeptide in the membrane fraction of each of mock-transfected cells and all the specific transfects (Fig. 3). An ∼100-kDa I1C immunoreactive band of the expected size for the fusion proteins was detected only in positively transfected cells (Fig. 3).Figure 3Expression of α2A-adrenoreceptor-Gi1α fusion proteins, immunoblotting studies. Homogenates of mock-transfected cells (lanes 1 and 2) and those expressing wild-type (lanes 3–10) or C442A (lanes 11–18) α2A-adrenoreceptor fusion proteins containing C351G Gi1α (lanes 3, 4, 11, and 12), C3S/C351G Gi1α (lanes 5,6, 13, and 14), G2A/C351G Gi1α (lanes 7, 8, 15, and 16), or G2A/C3S/C351G Gi1α (lanes 9, 10, 17, and 18) were resolved into P2 particulate (even numbered lanes) and cytosolic (odd numbered lanes) preparations, resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted to detect the presence of Gi1α. In cells expressing each of the fusion proteins, a polypeptide of some 100 kDa was detected.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Membranes of cells expressing the α2A-adrenoreceptor-C351G Gi1α fusion protein were able to support concentration-dependent stimulation of pertussis toxin-insensitive high affinity GTPase activity upon addition of UK14304 (EC50 = 2.3 ± 0.3 × 10−7m) (Fig.4 A). In contrast to the lack of functional interactions between co-expressed but independent α2A-adrenoreceptor and C3S/C351G Gi1α (Fig.1), expression of the fusion protein containing the C3S mutation also resulted in agonist-mediated stimulation of high affinity GTPase activity (EC50 = 4.4 ± 1.1 × 10−7m) (Fig. 4 A). This was also true for the two fusion proteins containing the G2A mutation in the G protein (Fig.4 A) and again EC50 values for UK14304 (G2A/C351G Gi1α = 3.5 ± 0.8 × 10−7m, G2A/C3S/C351G Gi1α = 3.2 ± 0.9 × 10−7m) (mean ± S.E.,n = 3 in each case) were not different. The porcine α2A-adrenoreceptor has a cysteine residue 9 amino acids from the C terminus that has been shown to act as an acceptor for post-translational palmitoylation (27Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8003-8011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although a C442A mutation of the receptor has been reported not to interfere with G protein activation (27Kennedy M.E. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8003-8011Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we considered whether potential palmitoylation of this cysteine might alter agonist regulation of the fusion proteins as palmitoylation is believed to provide an extra site of membrane anchorage and generate a “fourth intracellular loop” in the receptor (11Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the C-terminal tail of the α2A-adrenoreceptor is only some 20 amino acids long, which is relatively short within the family of G protein-coupled receptors, and we wished to consider if the extra flexibility following removal of the site of palmitoylation might influence regulation of fusion protein activation by agonist. Fusion proteins containing the pertussis toxin-insensitive C351G Gi1α in concert with G2A, C3S, and G2A/C3S mutations were constructed with the C442A α2A-adrenoreceptor (Fig. 2) and expressed in COS-7 cells. Each of these constructs was expressed to a similar level as those containing the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3), and each was able to stimulate pertussis toxin-insensitive high affinity GTPase activity in response to UK14304 to similar extents and with similar EC50 values (2.2–2.8 × 10−7m in individual transfections) as the fusion proteins containing the wild-type receptor sequence (Fig. 4 B). Co-expression of the β1γ2 complex with the wild-type α2A-adrenoreceptor-C351G Gi1α fusion protein resulted in substantially greater maximal stimulation of GTPase activity by UK14304 than achieved without excess β1γ2 (Fig.5 A). This did not reflect increased levels of expression of the fusion protein (Fig.5 B) or alterations in the EC50 for UK14304 (data not shown but see (19Wise A. Carr I.C. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). Additional expression of β1γ2 also increased the maximal GTPase activity in response to UK14304 of each of the G2A/C351G, C3S/C351G, and G2A/C3S/C351G forms of Gi1α constrained in fusion proteins with the wild-type α2A-adrenoreceptor (Fig.5 A), consistent with interaction of the β1γ2 complex with all of the individual fusion proteins. This is despite the known role of the N-terminal region of the G protein α subunit, which is constrained in the fusion constructs, in βγ binding (28Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A.

Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar). Acylation of G protein α subunits plays a key role in the membrane targeting and association of these proteins (3Casey P.J.

Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Furthermore, prevention of myristoylation of the α subunit of Gi-like G proteins reduces their affinity of interaction with the βγ complex and can render them cytoplasmic (5Mumby S.M. Heuckeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 728-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 6Jones T.L.Z. Simonds W.F. Merendino J.J. Brann M.R. Spiegel A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Prevention of palmitoylation also limits membrane association and has been reported to limit or prevent interactions with receptors (7Parenti M. Vigano M.A. Newman C.M.H. Milligan G. Magee A.I. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 9Galbiati F. Guzzi F. Magee A.I. Milligan G. Parenti M. Biochem.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, it has been unclear whether poor activation of acylation-defective G protein α subunits by receptors is simply a problem associated with the lack of appropriate targeting and thus proximity to a receptor or is inherently due to the acylation status of the G protein. In the current study, we have taken a highly novel approach to address this question. This has involved the construction of chimeric fusion proteins between the α2A-adrenoreceptor and the α subunit of the G protein Gi1. To do so involved the apparently simplistic expedient of linking the N terminus of the G protein directly to the C terminus of the receptor. The strategy used resulted in a minimal alteration to the sequence of the protein in the region of fusion. Indeed, only the C-terminal amino acid of the receptor was altered (Val to Ala), and the initiator Met of the G protein, which would normally be removed, remained in the sequence of the new protein (see Fig. 2). Only a single previous example has examined the potential for signal transduction following expression of a GPCR fused to its cognate G protein α subunit. In the case of the β2-adrenoreceptor-Gsα chimera, addition of agonist was able to cause activation of adenylyl cyclase following expression of the fusion protein in a cell line that genetically lacks endogenous Gsα (18Bertin B. Friessmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As well as using the wild-type receptor and G protein, fusion chimeras were generated between the wild-type α2A-adrenoreceptor and mutant forms of Gi1α in which the sites that are normally palmitoylated and myristoylated in the G protein were modified. Expression of each of these constructs could be detected in the membrane fraction following transient transfection of each of these in COS-7 cells. This was achieved both in binding assays using the highly selective and high affinity α2-adrenoreceptor antagonist [3H]RS-79948–197 (23Gillard N.P. Linton C.J. Milligan G. Carr I.C. Patmore L. Brown C.M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 117: 298PGoogle Scholar) to detect the ligand binding site of the receptor (Fig. 5) and by immunoblotting cytosolic and membrane fractions of these cells with the specific Gi1α antiserum I1C (24Green A. Johnson J.L. Milligan G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5206-5210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Gi1α is expressed endogenously in COS-7 cells at low levels and could be detected as a 41-kDa polypeptide by this antiserum in membranes from both mock and positively transfected cells. In contrast, membranes of positively transfected but not mock-transfected cells displayed the presence of an I1C reactive polypeptide of some 100 kDa, which corresponds to the chimeric fusion proteins (Fig. 3). Similar levels of the fusion proteins were expressed whether the G protein element of the fusion protein was wild type at the N terminus or contained G2A, C3S, or both mutations (Fig. 3), and none of these immunoreactive proteins were detected in the cytosolic fractions. As with many GPCRs (11Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), the α2A-adrenoreceptor is also a target for post-translational palmitoylation, at Cys442 within the C-terminal tail. Because this acylation is proposed to create a “fourth intracellular loop” in the receptor structure and because this receptor has only a short C-terminal tail, we also created chimeric fusion proteins between a C442A mutant of the α2A-adrenoreceptor and the various forms of Gi1α detailed above. Although previous studies have indicated this mutation in the receptor not to interfere with agonist-mediated G protein activation, we wished to assess whether potential greater flexibility provided by a longer “linker” between the seventh transmembrane element of the receptor and the N terminus of the G protein α subunit would affect agonist activation of the G protein. All of the C442A-α2A-adrenoreceptor-Gi1α fusions were also expressed and to similar levels as the versions that included the wild-type receptor (Fig. 3). As an aid to subsequent analysis, we generated all of the fusion proteins using a form of Gi1α in which Cys-351, which is the normal target for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation, was substituted by Gly. We have previously demonstrated that C351G Gi1α is not a substrate for pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It can, however, be activated by the α2A-adrenoreceptor, with the only clear difference, compared with the wild-type G protein, being that some 10–15-fold higher concentrations of agonist are required to produce the same degree of stimulation (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This is presumably a reflection of the alteration in conformation of the C terminus of the G protein, an element known to be a key receptor contact site (30Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Such mutations, however, allow receptor regulation of the mutated G protein to be studied in isolation following pertussis toxin-treatment of cells to eliminate potential functional contacts between the receptor and the endogenously expressed Gi-family G proteins (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 31Senogles S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23120-23127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hunt T.W. Carroll R.C. Peralta E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29565-29570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As such, all of the functional experiments herein were performed following pertussis toxin treatment of the cells for times and with amounts of toxin that cause modification of all of the endogenous Gi-like G proteins (20Wise A. Watson-Koken M.-A. Rees S. Lee M. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 721-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). All of the expressed chimeric fusion proteins were able to stimulate high affinity pertussis toxin-insensitive GTPase activity in membranes of the transfected COS-7 cells upon addition of the α2-adrenoreceptor agonist UK14304. Agonist stimulation of high affinity GTPase activity is a classical assay to measure both GDP-GTP exchange and then subsequent GTP hydrolysis by a G protein α subunit (25McKenzie F.R. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1990; 267: 391-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 26Koski G. Klee W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4185-4189Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As such, these results demonstrate both that the G protein α subunit is folded appropriately to exchange guanine nucleotide and to act as an enzyme and that information, presumably mediated via conformational change, can be transmitted from the binding of agonist to the receptor on to the G protein. These data thus further demonstrate the general utility of generating chimeric fusion proteins to examine receptor regulation of G protein function (18Bertin B. Friessmuth M. Jockers R. Strosberg A.D. Marullo S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8827-8831Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 19Wise A. Carr I.C. Milligan G. Biochem. J. 1997; 325: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). G2A and G2A/C3S mutants of Gi1α are essentially completely cytosolic (9Galbiati F. Guzzi F. Magee A.I. Milligan G. Parenti M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and thus it is not surprising that they are not activated by receptor agonists (21Wise, A., Grassie, M. A., Parenti, M., Lee, M., Rees, S., and Milligan, G. (1997) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). Physical proximity, as guaranteed from the fusion protein approach, showed that the lack of functional activation of such acylation negative mutants of G proteins by a co-expressed receptor is related to deficiencies in cellular targeting and location rather than an inherent incapacity to produce appropriate protein-protein interactions for signal transmission. As the fusion chimeras containing the G2A and C3S mutants required similar concentrations of UK14304 to cause half-maximal effects, this also argues that acylation is not inherently required to produce effective protein-protein contacts between the receptor and G protein α subunit but rather is to position the G protein appropriately. It was noted, however, that the fusion constructs containing both the G2A and C3S mutations in Gi1α displayed somewhat lower GTPase activity in response to maximally effective concentrations of UK14304 rather than the other constructs (Fig. 4). The reason for this requires further investigation. The C3S mutation of Gi1α results in expression of a protein that is partially cytoplasmic but partially membrane-associated (9Galbiati F. Guzzi F. Magee A.I. Milligan G. Parenti M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). As such, by increasing levels of expression of C3S Gi1α, it is possible to obtain levels of this mutant at the membrane as high or higher than that following expression of wild-type Gi1α (21Wise, A., Grassie, M. A., Parenti, M., Lee, M., Rees, S., and Milligan, G. (1997) Biochemistry, in pressGoogle Scholar). Despite this, the independently expressed α2A-adrenoreceptor is unable to cause significant activation of C3S Gi1α (Fig. 1). The reason for this remains to be resolved as the fusion proteins containing C3S Gi1α were as effectively stimulated by UK14304 as any of the others (Fig. 4). Given the nature of the physical linkage between the receptor and G protein in the fusion proteins, the knowledge that the N terminus of the G protein α subunit plays a central role in interaction with the βγ complex (28Wall M.A. Coleman D.E. Lee E. Iniguez-Lluhi J.A. Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 29Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P.

Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar), the concept that the βγ complex may play a key role in receptor interactions with the α subunit (33Kisselev O. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25356-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 34Kisselev O. Pronin A. Ermolaeva M. Gautam N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 3336-3339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the understanding that G protein α subunit acylation is important in interactions with the βγ complex, it was of considerable interest to observe that co-expression of excess β1γ2 along with any of the α2A-adrenoreceptor-Gi1α fusion proteins resulted in greater maximal UK14304 stimulation of GTPase activity (Fig. 5). A trivial explanation for this observation based on higher steady-state levels of expression of the fusion protein in the presence of excess βγ was eliminated by performing 3H-antagonist binding studies (Fig. 5). These results imply interaction of the fusion protein with the βγ complex, but understanding the details of this will require further study. It is of interest in this regard to note, however, that Taylor et al. (36Taylor J.M. Jacob-Mosier G.G. Lawton R.G. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27618-27624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have previously indicated a role for βγ in receptor stimulation of the GTPase activity of the α2A-adrenoreceptor. Overall these studies demonstrate the receptor-G protein fusion approach to be a novel and useful means to study receptor-G protein interactions and indicate a key role for G protein acylation in cellular targeting but not intrinsically in transmission of information between receptors and G proteins.

In primary culture, connexin-43 is expressed by thyrocytes in monolayers or reorganized into follicles, whereas the expression of connexin-32 is dependent upon the reconstitution of follicles. To study the functional impact of connexin-32 gap junctions in thyroid cells, we transfected connexin-32 cDNA in two thyroid-derived communication-deficient cell lines, FRT and FRTL-5. The selected clones, which stably expressed connexin-32 at high levels and exhibited high gap junction-mediated dye-coupling, presented a reduced proliferation rate as compared with that of the corresponding wild-type FRT and FRTL-5 cells; the mean population doubling time was increased by ∼35%. The proliferation of connexin-32-transfected FRTL-5 cells remained thyrotropin-dependent; the range of thyrotropin concentrations that stimulated growth was the same in transfected and control cells. The expression of connexin-32 led to an increase of thyroglobulin gene expression in FRTL-5 cells. The expression of two other tissue-specific proteins, thyroid transcription factor-1 and Pax-8, was unchanged.

These findings provide evidence that connexin-32 gap junction-mediated cell-to-cell communication participates in the control of growth and differentiation of thyroid cells. Gap junctions (GJ) are ubiquitous intercellular junctions allowing the cell-to-cell exchange of small cytoplasmic molecules. These exchanges have long been thought to play a role in the regulation of cell growth and cell differentiation in a number of tissues (1Loewenstein W.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 560: 1-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 2Guthrie S.C. Gilula N.B. Trends Neurosci. 1989; 12: 12-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). GJ proteins, connexins (Cx), 1The abbreviations used are: GJ, gap junction(s); Cx, connexin(s); TSH, thyrotropin; kbp, kilobase pair(s); TTF-1, thyroid transcription factor-1.belong to a multigenic family, each member presenting its own tissue-specific distribution. Despite strong overall homologies between Cx, functional properties (including permeability properties) differ from one Cx to the other. In most tissues, the determination of the role of a given Cx is complicated by the coexpression of several other different Cx (for reviews, see Refs. 3Dermietzel R. Hwang T.K. Spray D.S. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 182: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 4Bennett M.V.L. Barrio L.C. Bargiello T.A. Spray D.C. Hertzberg E. Saez J.C.

Rev. 1990; 11: 302-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 9Munari-Silem Y. Rousset B. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1996; 135: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) including the thyroid. Previous work from our laboratory has established that polarized thyroid epithelial cells or thyrocytes present an unusual Cx expression pattern; they coexpress Cx32 and Cx43. Cx32 GJ are scattered along the lateral domain of the plasma membrane, and Cx43 GJ are precisely located within the tight junction network (10Guerrier A. Fonlupt P. Morand I. Rabilloud R. Audebet C. Krutovskikh V. Gros D. Rousset B. Munari-Silem Y. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar). Using pig thyrocytes in primary culture, which, under defined culture conditions, either spread in monolayers or reconstitute follicles, we have shown that the Cx43 gene is always expressed. By contrast, the Cx32 gene is expressed only in thyrocytes that reorganize into follicles (11Munari-Silem Y. Guerrier A. Fromaget C. Rabilloud R. Gros D. Rousset B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cx32 GJ and Cx43 GJ that reconstitute in thesein vitro systems are functional, and thyrotropin (TSH) controls both Cx synthesis and the level of junctional coupling between thyrocytes (11Munari-Silem Y. Guerrier A. Fromaget C. Rabilloud R. Gros D. Rousset B. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 724-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 12Munari-Silem Y. Audebet C. Rousset B. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3299-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The respective roles of Cx32 GJ and Cx43 GJ in thyroid gland functioning are not known. Cx32 GJ could play a prominent role since Cx32 expression correlates with the expression of thyroid histiotypic differentiation, i.e. follicle formation. To try to document the functional impact of cell-to-cell communication via Cx32 GJ, we have chosen to transfect two rat thyroid-derived cell lines (FRT and FRTL-5) that are communication-deficient with the rat Cx32 cDNA. Several clones that stably expressed high levels of Cx32 have been isolated from each cell line. All of them presented a high level of GJ-mediated cell-to-cell communication and exhibited a decreased growth rate as compared with the corresponding parental cells. Interestingly, stable expression of Cx32 by differentiated FRTL-5 cells led to up-regulation of the thyroglobulin gene. The 1.5-kb pCx32 cDNA (containing the entire coding region) was isolated from the pGEM-3 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. D. L. Paul) (13Paul D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) by EcoRI site digestion. Cx32 cDNA was inserted into the pSVK3 plasmid (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) after linearization and dephosphorylation at its uniqueEcoRI site, yielding pSVK3-Cx32. The proper orientation of the cDNA insert was controlled by electrophoretic analysis ofKpnI and PstI restriction enzyme digestion fragments and nucleotide sequencing of the appropriate region. FRT and FRTL-5 cells were kindly provided by Prof. L. Nitsch (Dipartimento di Biologia e Patologia Cellulare e Moleculare “L. Califano,” Universita Degli Studi di Napoli Federico II, (Naples, Italy). These two cell lines, derived from normal thyroids of Fischer rats, have been previously characterized (14Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Parks L.A.M. Coon H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3455-3459Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 15Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Picone R. Tramontano D. Cold Spring Harbor Conf. Cell Proliferation. 1982; 9: 483-492Google Scholar). FRTL-5 cells were grown in complete culture medium composed of Coon's modified Ham's F-12 medium (Seromed, Berlin, Germany) containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin and supplemented with 5% calf serum and a five-hormone mixture (10 μg/ml insulin, 10 nmhydrocortisone, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 10 ng/ml glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine acetate, and 1 milliunits/ml TSH) as described (15Ambesi-Impiombato F.S. Picone R. Tramontano D. Cold Spring Harbor Conf. Cell Proliferation. 1982; 9: 483-492Google Scholar). All hormones were from Sigma. FRT cells were cultured in the same medium as FRTL-5 cells, except that TSH was omitted and calf serum was replaced by fetal calf serum (Sigma). Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C under a 95% air and 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere and were routinely subcultured by trypsinization with a change of medium twice weekly. FRT and FRTL-5 cells (∼3–5 × 105 cells/100-mm Petri dish) were cotransfected with two plasmids (pSVK3-Cx32 and pCMV-neo) using the calcium phosphate precipitation procedure followed by a glycerol shock. The optimal conditions of transfection were slightly different for the two cell lines. FRT cells were incubated for 3–4 h with calcium phosphate in the presence of 20–30 μg of pSVK3-Cx32 and 2–3 μg of pCMV-neo and then subjected to a 1-min glycerol shock. For FRTL-5 cells, the incubation in the presence of calcium phosphate was reduced to 1 h, and then cells were subjected to a 3-min glycerol shock. For both cell types, 48 h after the outset of transfection, the neomycin analogue, G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), was added to the medium at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml. The medium containing G418 was changed every 3 days. After 3 weeks of selective pressure in the presence of G418, neomycin-resistant FRT colonies were picked by trypsinization in cloning cylinders and grown separately under selective conditions. In the case of FRTL-5 cells, only neomycin-resistant colonies judged to be well coupled by microinjection of lucifer yellow (see “Measurement of Intercellular Communication”) were picked up and grown for subsequent analyses. For controls, cells were cotransfected under the conditions described above, but with pCMV-neo and the pSVK3 vector lacking Cx32 cDNA. FRT and FRTL-5 transfectants were maintained in the appropriate media containing G418 at a concentration of 0.05 mg/ml. cDNAs encoding rat Cx26 (clone Cx26-1; 1.1 kbp), rat Cx32 (1.5 kbp), and rat Cx43 (clone G1; 2.5 kbp) originate from Drs. B. J. Nicholson (16Zhang J.-T. Nicholson B.J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3391-3401Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), D. L. Paul (13Paul D.L. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), and E. C. Beyer (17Beyer E.C. Paul D.L. Goodenough D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2621-2629Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar), respectively. cDNA clone G1 contains 92% of the coding region for Cx43; the other two cDNAs contain the complete coding regions of Cx26 and Cx32. G1 Cx43 cDNA was extracted from the Bluescript plasmid using EcoRI and then digested with StuI (Promega); thisEcoRI-StuI fragment (1.03 kbp; positions 293–1323) was used for hybridization experiments. Cx32 cDNA as well as Cx26 cDNA were extracted from the pGEM-3 plasmid byEcoRI site digestion. The thyroglobulin cDNA probe corresponds to the human thyroglobulin 0.7-kbp M1 fragment (18Malthiery Y. Lissitzky S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 165: 491-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The rat Pax-8 cDNA fragment (0.3 kbp), corresponding to the paired domain fragment (19Zannini M. Francis-Lang H. Plachov D. Di Lauro R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4230-4241Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), was extracted from the C27 B2xx22 plasmid byEcoRI and HindIII restriction site digestion. The rat TTF-1 cDNA fragment (0.6 kbp), corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region, was extracted from the Bluescript THA plasmid (20Guazzi S. Price M. De Felice M. Damante G. Mattei M.G. Di Lauro R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3631-3639Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). cDNA probes, prepared from DNA fragments isolated by electrophoresis and purified using the QIAEX gel extraction kit (QIAGEN Inc.), were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random hexanucleotide primed synthesis. Total RNA was isolated from wild-type FRT and FRTL-5 cells, stable transfected clones, and control rat tissues (liver, cervix, and heart) using the guanidinium isothiocyanate/acid phenol extraction method of Chomczynski and Sacchi (21Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63290) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of total RNA (20 μg/sample) was performed as described (22Fromaget C. El Aoumari A. Dupont E. Briand J.P. Gros D. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1990; 22: 1245-1258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Hybridized membranes were exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C with intensifying screens. The efficiency of transfer and the integrity of RNA were checked by hybridization with a β-actin probe. Cells attached to Petri dishes fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.25% Triton X-100 for 30 min at 20 °C were incubated with anti-Cx32 antibodies diluted 1:1000 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 20 °C. Anti-Cx32 antibodies were generated in rabbit against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the sequence of the cytoplasmic loop of rat Cx32 (residues 98–124) (10Guerrier A. Fonlupt P. Morand I. Rabilloud R. Audebet C. Krutovskikh V. Gros D. Rousset B. Munari-Silem Y. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar). A goat anti-rabbit Ig F(ab′)2fragment conjugated to fluorescein (Sigma) was used as secondary antibody. Immunofluorescent images were taken using a SIT camera (LHESA Electronique, Cercy Pontoise, France) installed on an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) coupled to an image-processing system (Sapphire, Quantel, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, France). Photomicrographs were prepared using a video printer (UP 5000 P, Sony, Tokyo). Cells at confluence in 100-mm culture dishes were collected in cold Earle's medium (pH 7.0) by scraping. After centrifugation, the cells were resuspended in 1 mmNaHCO3 supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin (buffer A) and lyzed by sonication. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resulting pellets were resuspended in buffer A containing 0.25%N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt (Sigma) and incubated for 20 min at 20 °C as described previously (10Guerrier A. Fonlupt P. Morand I. Rabilloud R. Audebet C. Krutovskikh V. Gros D. Rousset B. Munari-Silem Y. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2609-2617PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the final pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris, 0.01% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2% (w/v) SDS, and 10 mg/ml bromphenol blue (pH 6.7). Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on SDS-12% acrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The transfer membrane was saturated in Blotto solution (40 mm Tris, 5% (w/v) skim milk, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with rabbit anti-Cx32 antibodies (1:500 final dilution in Blotto) for 2 h at room temperature. After extensive washings in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20 (pH 8.0), immunocomplexes were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium substrates (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Western blot analyses of thyroglobulin were performed on total cell extracts. Cell-to-cell communication was analyzed using the low M rfluorescent probe lucifer yellow CH (Sigma), originally described by Stewart (23Stewart W.W. Cell. 1978; 14: 741-759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). The probe was microinjected into one cell, and after diffusion to adjacent cells, the number of lucifer yellow-labeled cells was counted as described previously (12Munari-Silem Y. Audebet C. Rousset B. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 3299-3309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at low density in multiwell culture dishes. After different culture times, cells were dissociated by mild trypsinization, and the number of cells/dish was counted under an inverted microscope equipped with phase-contrast optics using an hemocytometer. FRT and FRTL-5 cells do not express the Cx expressed in normal thyrocytes. No Cx32 transcript was detected in total RNA from FRT and FRTL-5 cells by Northern blotting (Fig.1 A, lanes 2and7, respectively); likewise, Cx43 and Cx26 transcripts could not be found (data not shown). The same negative results were also obtained at the protein level. Neither Cx32 (Fig. 1 B,lanes 2and 7) nor Cx43 (data not shown) was detected by Western blot analyses of FRT or FRTL-5 detergent-resistant membrane extracts. Immunofluorescence labeling with anti-Cx32 (Fig.2, A and E) or anti-Cx43 (data not shown) antibodies was also negative. The inability to detect any of the three Cx (Cx32, Cx43, and Cx26) was in keeping with the absence of or the very low level of junctional coupling analyzed by lucifer yellow microinjection. In FRTL-5 cells, lucifer yellow was never transmitted from the injected cells to surrounding cells as illustrated Fig. 3 B(panel b). In FRT cells, the dye was sometimes detected in some cells (two to five cells) adjacent to the injected cell several minutes after microinjection (Fig. 3 A, panel b). The low level of coupling observed in FRT cells could be either related to the presence of a low number of GJ channels composed of Cx32, Cx43, or Cx26 expressed in minute amounts or dependent on channels composed of another Cx than those normally expressed in thyroid cells.Figure 2Immunofluorescence detection of Cx32 in transfected FRT and FRTL-5 cells.

Among ∼70 clones, the three clones expressing the highest levels of Cx32 mRNA (clones A, B, and C) (Fig. 1 A) were selected and used for subsequent studies. The Cx32 mRNA content of clones A and C (Fig. 1 A,lanes 4and 6) was higher than that of clone B (lane 5). FRTL-5 cells expressing the Cx32 gene were identified by their high junctional coupling. Three clones (clones I, P, and Q) were selected; they expressed similar levels of Cx32 transcripts (Fig. 1 A, lanes 9–11). Cx32 mRNA was absent in FRT and FRTL-5 cells cotransfected with the neomycin gene and the empty pSVK3 vector (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3and8). The expression of the Cx32 gene in FRT and FRTL-5 cells was further analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence labeling. The Cx32 protein of the expected size (27–28 kDa) was immunodetected in all the Cx32 mRNA-positive clones (Fig.1 B, lanes 4–6 for FRT cell-derived clones andlanes 9–11 for FRTL-5 cell-derived clones). As expected from mRNA data, the amount of Cx32 protein in clone B of FRT cells was lower than that detected in both clones A and C (Fig.1 B, compare lane 5 with lanes 4and6). In transfected FRTL-5 cells, the amount of Cx32 protein was similar in the three clones (Fig. 1 B, lanes 9–11). Fig. 2 illustrates the cellular distribution of Cx32 in transfected FRT and FRTL-5 cells. The immunofluorescence labeling of Cx32-transfected FRT cells was qualitatively similar for the three clones (Fig. 2,B–D); it appeared as discontinuous lines and/or dots delineating the region of cell-cell contacts. Bright dots were also visible over the cells. In Cx32-transfected FRTL-5 cells, the labeling profile was different. In the three clones (Fig. 2, F–H), the labeling appeared as rather large and round spots more randomly distributed over the cells. As FRTL-5 cells did not spread very well on the Petri dish, but rather remained tightly grouped, the location of the labeled spots was more difficult to establish; fluorescent spots were found in the regions of cell-cell contacts, but also in other regions of the plasma membrane or possibly inside the cells. In both cell types, Cx32-transfected cells were intensely labeled. The level of Cx32 expression (assessed by mRNA and protein measurements) remained stable beyond 30 and 20 passages in transfected FRT and FRTL-5 cells, respectively. These results show that the Cx32- transfected cells we selected stably overexpressed the exogenous rat Cx32 gene, the major part of the protein being addressed to the plasma membrane. Cx32-transfected cells exhibited a high level of GJ-mediated intercellular communication. When microinjected into one cell, lucifer yellow was detected within seconds in numerous cells in the vicinity of the microinjected one; this is illustrated for FRT cell-derived and FRTL-5 cell-derived clones in Fig. 3 (A andB, respectively). The level of cell-to-cell communication or junctional coupling of each clone was quantified; the results are presented in the form of histograms of frequency (Fig.4) that allow the collection and comparison of data from multiple microinjection tests on the different clones. Among the Cx32-transfected FRT cells, clones A and C, which presented the highest level of Cx32 expression, showed the highest dye-coupling capacity. Indeed, >50% of the cells from clones A and B and only 15% from clone C communicated with >20 neighbor cells. The three clones of Cx32-transfected FRTL-5 cells exhibited similar junctional coupling levels. These data unequivocally establish that Cx32 protein synthesized by FRT and FRTL-5 cells from the exogenous Cx32 cDNA is competent to form functional gap junction channels. In this study, FRT and FRTL-5 cells that stably express Cx32 are designated Cx32-FRT and Cx32-FRTL-5, respectively. The proliferation rate of Cx32-transfected cells was compared with that of control cells (wild-type cells and cells expressing the neomycin resistance gene: FRT-neo or FRTL-5-neo). The results of Fig.5 A show that the proliferation rate of the three clones of Cx32-FRT cells was significantly lower than that of control cells. Interestingly, cells from clone B (the clone among the three that expressed the lowest level of Cx32 and intercellular communication) had an intermediate growth rate between that of control cells and that of cells from the two other clones (clones A and C). The growth rate of the three clones of Cx32-FRTL-5 cells was also markedly reduced as compared with that of control cells. After a 10-day culture period, the population of Cx32-FRTL-5 cells represented less than half of that of wild-type FRTL-5 cells. TableI gives the average population doubling time calculated for each clone in different experiments. One can observe that the mean doubling time was increased by ∼35% in two of the three clones of Cx32-FRT cells and in the three clones of Cx32-FRTL-5 cells (as compared with that of the corresponding parental wild-type cells).Table IPopulation doubling time of FRT and FRTL-5 cells transfected with the rat Cx32 geneClonesPopulation doubling timehFRT cells Wild-type23.2 ± 1.1 Neo23.7 ± 1.6 Cx32-A31.4 ± 1.61-aStatistically different from controls (p < 0.05).

Cold Spring Harbor Conf. Cell Proliferation. 1982; 9: 483-492Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.6 A, the proliferation of FRTL-5 cells is arrested upon TSH withdrawal. When TSH was omitted from the culture medium, the growth of Cx32-FRTL-5 cells was also totally blocked, indicating that the proliferation of the communication-competent cells remained TSH-dependent. To determine whether the reduction in the rate of proliferation of Cx32-FRTL-5 cells was related to a change in their TSH responsiveness, we compared the growth rate of Cx32-transfected and wild-type FRTL-5 cells in response to increasing concentrations of TSH. The concentration-response curves shown in Fig. 6 B indicate that the concentration of TSH required to obtain 50% of the maximum growth rate was very similar for transfected and nontransfected cells (∼50 microunits/ml). Proliferation of FRTL-5 cells is known to be activated by insulin. In this study, insulin (10 μg/ml) was systematically added to the FRTL-5 culture medium. The difference in growth between transfected and nontransfected cells was similar in the presence and absence of insulin (Fig. 6 C). By varying the serum concentration from 0.5 to 5%, the difference in proliferation between wild-type and Cx32-FRTL-5 cells was maintained (Fig. 6 D). FRTL-5 cells expressed several thyroid-specific genes, including the genes encoding thyroglobulin, the thyroid prohormone, and two transcription factors (TTF-1 and Pax-8), as shown in Fig.7 (lane 1in A–C, respectively). TTF-1 and Pax-8 mRNA levels were similar in Cx32-FRTL-5, wild-type FRTL-5, and control FRTL-5-neo cells; but a huge increase in the amount of thyroglobulin mRNA was reproducibly observed in the three clones of Cx32-FRTL-5 cells (Fig. 7 A, compare lanes 3–5 with lanes 1and2). The increase of thyroglobulin gene expression in Cx32-transfected cells was confirmed at the protein level. The Western blot analysis results reported in Fig. 7 E show that thyroglobulin was present in higher amounts in Cx32-FRTL-5 cells (lanes 3–5) than in control cells (lanes 1and2). FRT cells expressed Pax-8, but neither TTF-1 nor thyroglobulin. The level of Pax-8 mRNA was similar in Cx32-FRT and control cells (data not shown). This study clearly demonstrates that, as a consequence of transfection with and expression of the exogenous Cx32 gene that led to the restoration of cell-to-cell communication, the rate of proliferation of FRT and FRTL-5 cells was significantly reduced. In all the selected clones, the levels of Cx32 mRNA and Cx32 protein as well as the level of junctional coupling, on one hand, and the reduction of growth, on the other, remained stable beyond 20 or 30 passages (in Cx32-FRT and Cx32-FRTL-5 cells, respectively), indicating a stable insertion of the cDNA into the genome of host cells.

Degenerate oligonucleotide primers to the N-terminal sequence of the purified protein and the region containing the active site histidine were used in reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction to obtain a major portion of the coding sequence for the mature protein. The sequences of the C and N termini of the mature protein, and eight residues in the signal peptide, were obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA end procedures. The entire coding sequence of a cytosolic form of NDP kinase was also determined. Both isoforms, which share 53% sequence identity, possess the characteristically conserved regions of known NDP kinases. The mature mitochondrial NDP kinase protein migrates in molecular sieving columns with an apparent molecular mass of about 66 kDa. It shows very high thermal stability even though it lacks the proline residue in thekiller of prune loop, and the Tyr/Glu C termini that are important in stabilizing other NDP kinases. The affinity of the mitochondrial isoform for adenine and guanine nucleotides is much higher than for pyrimidine nucleotides, but the enzyme is especially susceptible to substrate inhibition by GDP. Semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed that the relative levels of expression of the mitochondrial isoform are liver > kidney ≫ heart = brain > breast muscle. The cytosolic isoform is strongly and approximately equally expressed in these same five tissues.

Interest in this enzyme increased sharply when it was discovered that the awd gene in Drosophila(1Biggs J. Hersperger E. Steeg P.S. Liotta L.A. Shearn A. Cell. 1990; 63: 933-940Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and nm23 genes in mammals (2Steeg P.S. Bevilacqua G. Kopper L. Thorgeirsson U.P. Talmadge J.E. Liotta L.A. Sobel M.E.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 445-449PubMed Google Scholar) encode proteins with NDP kinase activity. Considerable evidence suggests that the NDP kinase protein family has regulatory functions in addition to and perhaps independent of its catalytic activity (4DeLaRosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Four isoforms of NDP kinase/nm23 have been identified in human thus far.Nm23-H1 is a suppressor of metastasis in some tumor types (4DeLaRosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Nm23-H2 is equivalent to the PuF gene whose product binds to the promoter of the c-myc gene and activates transcription (5Ji L. Arcinas M. Boxer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13392-13398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 6Hildebrandt M. Lacombe M.L. Mesnildrey S. Veron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3858-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). DR-nm23 shares 70% identity with the first two genes. Its overexpression inhibits granulocyte differentiation and induces apoptosis (7Venturelli D. Martinez R. Melotti P. Casella I. Peschle C. Cucco C. Spampinato G. Darzynkiewicz Z. Calabretta B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7435-7439Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The fourth gene,nm23-H4, encodes an NDP kinase with an apparent presequence that has some characteristics consistent with import into mitochondria (8Milon L. Rousseau-Merck M.-F. Munier A. Erent A. Lascu I. Capeau J. Lacombe M.-L. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The products of nm23-H1 and nm23-H2, NDP kinase-A and NDP kinase-B, respectively, show 88% sequence identity with each other (9Gilles A.-M. Presecan E. Vonica A. Lascu I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8784-8789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and are highly homologous to awd, a gene in Drosophila that is associated with abnormal wing development (10Rosengard A.M. Krutzsch H.C. Shearn A. Biggs J.R. Barker E. Margulies I.M. King C.R. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Nature. 1989; 342: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar).Several residues that are important in the catalytic and/or regulatory activities of NDP kinase have been identified by site-directed mutagenesis and x-ray diffraction studies (11Williams R.L.

Structure. 1993; 1: 283-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Thus an understanding of structure-function relationships in NDP kinase is developing rapidly.The role of NDP kinase in metabolism has long been uncertain, especially with regard to compartmentation and channeling phenomena. The enzyme was discovered in the early 1950s when the roles of non-adenine nucleotides in metabolism were being elucidated (17Berg P. Joklik W.K. Nature. 1953; 172: 1008-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Krebs H.A. Hems R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1953; 12: 172-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the possibility that the enzyme might be a coupling factor in oxidative phosphorylation was being explored (19Wadkins C.L. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 2555-2563Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 20Glaze R.P. Wadkins C.L. J. Biol.

Discovery of the GTP specificity of succinate thiokinase in some mammalian tissues (beef heart and pig kidney) provided a ready explanation for the presence of NDP kinase in mitochondria, namely NDP kinase is needed to catalyze the reaction of GTP produced in the Krebs cycle with ADP to form ATP and regenerate GDP (22Sanadi D.R. Gibson D.M. Ayengar P. Jacob M. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 218: 505-520Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 23Sanadi D.R. Gibson D.M. Ayengar P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1954; 14: 434-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This explanation has been widely accepted, although considerable evidence suggests that mitochondria from some tissues and species have very low activity of NDP kinase in matrix space (24Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 25Heldt H.W. Schwalbach K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Tokumitsu Y. Ui M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 310-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), and/or possess succinate thiokinase that is specific for ATP rather than GTP (27Hansford R.G. FEBS Lett. 1973; 31: 317-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 28Hamilton M.L. Ottaway J.H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).Until recently, the only genetic information for a mitochondrially targeted isoform of NDP kinase was the sequence of guk inDictyostelium discoideum, which encodes a protein with a signaling sequence that directs it to the intermembrane space (29Troll H. Winckler T. Lascu I. Muller N. Saurin W. Veron M. Mutzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25469-25475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The genetic and functional relationships between mitochondrial isoforms and between mitochondrial isoforms and their cytosolic counterparts are not known. The possibility that isoforms directed to different cellular compartments may have different properties has received little attention.The amount of NDP kinase activity that can be found within and outside the inner membrane barrier of mitochondria is highly variable with species and tissue (30Muhonen W.W. Lambeth D.O. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 110: 211-223Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For example, both compartmental and functional studies strongly indicate that more than 95% of the NDP kinase activity associated with rat liver mitochondria is located outside the inner membrane barrier (24Schnaitman C. Greenawalt J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 38: 158-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar, 25Heldt H.W. Schwalbach K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 199-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 26Tokumitsu Y. Ui M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 310-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In contrast, Jacobus and Evans (31Jacobus W.E. Evans J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 4232-4241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found that although a lower amount of NDP kinase is associated with rat heart mitochondria, much of it is inside the inner membrane barrier.To date there have been no studies on NDP kinase that was clearly purified from the matrix space of mitochondria. The mitochondrial NDP kinase from bovine liver that has been extensively studied (20Glaze R.P. Wadkins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 2139-2150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Goffeau A. Pedersen P.L. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1845-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is released by aging mitochondria in isotonic media, a procedure that likely solubilizes the enzyme from the intermembrane space or the outer membrane (33Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).We earlier showed that pigeon, unlike rat, has an abundance of NDP kinase localized in the matrix compartment of liver mitochondria (30Muhonen W.W. Lambeth D.O. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1995; 110: 211-223Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here we report the purification and characterization of mitochondrial matrix NDP kinase, and the sequences of the cDNAs encoding this protein and an apparent cytosolic isoform that is highly homologous to NDP kinase-A and NDP kinase-B in human.DISCUSSIONHere we report the first characterization of an isoform of NDP kinase that is clearly targeted to the matrix space of mitochondria. Although this isoform is clearly homologous to other NDP kinases, it shows rather low sequence identity with the presently known isoforms, including nm23-H4, the only one of the four isoforms in human characterized thus far that may be targeted to mitochondria. A submitochondrial location for nm23-H4 has not been suggested (8Milon L. Rousseau-Merck M.-F. Munier A. Erent A. Lascu I. Capeau J. Lacombe M.-L. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Present genetic evidence suggests that there are at least two mitochondrial isoforms, one targeted to the matrix (this work) and the other to the intermembrane space (29Troll H. Winckler T. Lascu I. Muller N. Saurin W. Veron M. Mutzel R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25469-25475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To obtain the sequence of the mitochondrial matrix isoform, a degenerate oligonucleotide primer to a unique portion of the N terminus was used in combination with the primer to the region of the active site histidine to amplify a major portion of the coding region. The RACE procedure was then used to obtain the sequence of the 3′ end and to extend the 5′ end to include the N terminus of the mature protein and the last eight residues of the signal sequence. Those eight residues fit the characteristic octapeptide motif that is recognized by the intermediate peptidase in mitochondrial matrix (38Isaya G. Kalousek F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 556-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Because the sequence obtained correctly encodes the N terminus of the mature protein, which has features that set it apart from other NDP kinases, we have no doubt that we have obtained the sequence for an NDP kinase isoform targeted to mitochondrial matrix. The matrix isoform shares only 53% sequence identity with the cytosolic NDP kinase also reported here. However, both contain eight residues (Lys-12, Tyr-52, Phe-60, Arg-88, Thr-94, Arg-105, Asn-115, and Glu-129; numbering corresponds to NDP kinase-A) that are critical for binding of substrates and catalysis (12Cherfils J. Morera S. Lascu I. Veron M. Janin J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9062-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Morera S. Lascu I. Dumas C. LeBras G. Briozzo P. Veron M. Janin J.

Biol. 1994; 243: 873-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Two other NDP kinase sequences have been reported that may contain signals for routing the enzyme to mitochondria: the guk gene which codes for a protein in the intermembrane space of mitochondria inDictyostelium (29Troll H.

Munier A. Erent A. Lascu I. Capeau J. Lacombe M.-L. Hum. Genet. 1997; 99: 550-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The NDP kinase isoform in pigeon mitochondria shows only 41.3% identity with the product of guk, which is about the same (44.7%) as with cytosolic NDP kinase in Dictyostelium.When the more than 50 complete and unique NDP kinase sequences currently in the data banks are compared pairwise with pigeon mitochondrial matrix NDP kinase, the closest homologues arenm23-H4 (69%) and nurse shark (57%). The phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 8 indicates that the gene duplication event which gave rise to the matrix isoform (and nm23-H4) preceded the duplication events leading to DR-nm23, nm23-H1, and nm23-H2. An intriguing possibility is that the gene for the matrix isoform originated with the presymbiont that gave rise to mitochondria with the gene later being transferred to the nuclear genome. The sequence identity of the pigeon mitochondrial matrix NDP kinase with the nm23-H4 product seems too low (69%) to suggest that their respective genes are coding for the same isoform of NDP kinase in the two species. Moreover, whereas nm23-H4 is strongly expressed in liver, heart, kidney, and skeletal muscle of human, the matrix isoform in pigeon is barely detectable in heart and breast muscle.The sequence of the mitochondrial isoform has several features that are different from other NDP kinases, especially those found in cytosol of eukaryotic species. Some of these features are also true ofnm23-H4. These include the lack of cysteine residues, which are found at positions 110 and 146 in the pigeon cytosolic isoform and the equivalent positions in NDP kinase-A and NDP kinase-B. Cysteines are known from protein modification work to also be present in the rat liver NDP kinase located outside the inner membrane barrier (40Goffeau A. Pedersen P.L. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1685-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the matrix isoform and nm23-H4 lack the equivalent of serine residues 44 and 120, which have been identified as autophosphorylation sites in NDP kinase-A and NDP kinase-B (41MacDonald N.J.

Both NDP kinases substitute alanine for glycine in the HGSDS sequence at the phosphorylation site of NDP kinase. Finally, both the pigeon mitochondrial matrix NDP kinase and the nm23-H4 gene product lack the proline in the killer of prune loop and the Tyr/Glu sequence at the C terminus. These two features have been shown to be very important in stabilizing hexameric NDP kinases (35Karlsson A. Mesnildrey S. Xu Y. Morera S. Janin J. Veron M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 12775-12781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this regard, both NDP kinases resemble prokaryotic NDP kinases, several of which have been shown to be tetrameric (11Williams R.L. Oren D.A. Munoz-Dorado J. Inouye S. Inouye M. Arnold E. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1230-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 43Almaula N. Lu Q. Delgado J. Belkin S. Inouye M. J.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 394: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 46Hemmerich S. Pecht I. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4580-4587Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), even though x-ray diffraction indicates that it is hexameric (14Webb P.A. Perisic O. Mendola C.E. Backer J.M. Williams R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 251: 574-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Bacterial NDPKs investigated thus far are tetrameric. The purified NDP kinase from mitochondrial matrix of pigeon migrates through gel filtration columns with an apparent molecular weight that is consistent with a tetramer.Thermal denaturation studies have been used to establish that a representative tetrameric NDP kinase has a lower stability than hexameric isoforms (36Giartosio A. Erent M. Cervoni L. Morera S. Janin J. Konrad M. Lascu I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17845-17851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to convincingly show that both P100 (numbering forDictyostelium) and the C-terminal Tyr/Glu sequence contribute strongly to thermal stability of the hexameric NDP kinase from Dictyostelium (35Karlsson A. Mesnildrey S. Xu Y. Morera S. Janin J. Veron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19928-19934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since the mitochondrial matrix NDP kinase is likely a tetramer, and also lacks the these two structural features, it was most surprising to find that it shows considerably higher thermal stability than the hexameric NDP kinases fromDictyostelium. However, different residues are responsible for subunit contacts in tetrameric as compared with hexameric NDP kinases (39Morera S. LeBras G. Lascu I. Lacombe M.L. Veron M. Janin J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 243: 873-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).Because early studies (20Glaze R.P. Wadkins C.L. J. Biol.

Academic Press, New York1962: 151-160Google Scholar) showed that NDP kinase utilized a wide variety of nucleotide substrates about equally well, the enzyme has long been considered to be nonspecific. The NDP kinase found outside the inner membrane of rat liver mitochondria exhibits similar apparent K m values for purine and pyrimidine nucleotides (33Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, NDP kinase from Candida albicans (whose intracellular compartmentation is not known) shows similar V max values for pyrimidine and purine substrates, but the K m values differed considerably with those for purine nucleotides being lower than pyrimidine (50Biondi R.M. Veron M. Walz K. Passeron S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 323: 187-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Our data for the matrix enzyme in mitochondria (Fig. 3) indicate a strong preference for purine over pyrimidine nucleotides, and for ribose over 2′-deoxyribose sugars. Thus dCTP and dCDP are particularly poor substrates for the matrix isoform, reacting at about 0.1% of the rate of purine nucleotides. One assay for NDP kinase has used dCTP because of its negligible rate as a donor in the hexokinase reaction. It is noteworthy that the use of dCTP has led to reports of the absence of NDP kinase in pigeon liver mitochondria (28Hamilton M.L. Ottaway J.H. FEBS Lett. 1981; 123: 252-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 33Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and perhaps other mitochondrial preparations.Substrate inhibition is often observed with enzymes that follow ping-pong kinetics and arises when a substrate binds to the alternative enzyme form, thus competing with the normal substrate for that form. The results shown in Fig. 1 indicate that GDP more effectively competes with ATP for the nonphosphorylated form of the enzyme than does ADP with GTP. In the reaction between dCTP and ADP (Fig. 2), substrate inhibition by ADP is observed when its concentration is above 0.05 mm. This provides additional evidence that pyrimidine nucleotides are poor substrates because of their lower affinity for the enzyme. Substrate inhibition by ADP has been reported for other NDP kinases (32Goffeau A. Pedersen P.L. Lehninger A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1967; 242: 1845-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Colomb M.G. Cheruy A. Vignais P.V. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 3370-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 47Garces E. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 633-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The strong inhibition of matrix NDP kinase by GDP has also been observed for the NDP kinase in the outer compartment of rat liver mitochondria (33Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3956-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Although the preferential use of guanine and adenine nucleotides is consistent with the major metabolic role of the matrix isoform of NDP kinase, it raises the question of whether the matrix enzyme can effectively produce the nucleotides needed for mitochondrial nucleic acid synthesis. This question is especially cogent in view of the much higher K m values for the nucleotides other than guanine and adenine and their much lower concentrations in mitochondrial matrix. Whereas guanine and adenine ribonucleotides are near or above the millimolar range, the concentrations of deoxyribonucleotides are likely in the low micromolar range (51Traut T.W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 140: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1255) Google Scholar), which means they will not effectively compete with guanine and adenine nucleotides for binding to NDP kinase.The major role of matrix NDP kinase is presumed to be the transfer of phosphoryl groups between the adenine and guanine nucleotide pools. However, the direction of transfer is uncertain and may vary with the metabolic status of the tissue. Although it is generally assumed that the matrix enzyme phosphorylates ADP by using GTP produced at the succinyl-CoA synthetase step in the Krebs cycle, the levels of matrix NDP kinase in mitochondria of pigeon are highest in liver and kidney. Mitochondria in these two tissues fulfill major synthetic roles, and both have high levels of guanine-specific, succinyl-CoA synthetase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase is a key enzyme in glucogenesis. The source of GTP for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase could either be succinyl-CoA synthetase, or NDP kinase, which would use ATP generated by oxidative phosphorylation to phosphorylate GDP. Ericinska and Wilson (52Erecinska M. Wilson D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10904-10906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that isolated liver mitochondria from several species can use external ATP to synthesize phosphoenolpyruvate in the matrix space, thus demonstrating that matrix NDP kinase can operate in the direction of GTP synthesis. However, there are data indicating that the GTP:GDP ratio in mitochondrial matrix is much higher than ATP:ADP (53Ottaway J.H. McClellan J.A. Saunderson C.L. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This can occur only if the GTP:GDP ratio is driven to a high level by GTP:GDP specific succinyl-CoA synthetase, and the GTP/GDP pool is prevented from equilibrating with the ATP/ADP pool. The latter requires that NDP kinase activity be low or absent. The synthesis of a coherent view of the role of NDP kinase in integrating adenine and guanine pools in the matrix space of mitochondria will require more data than is presently available.In summary, we have characterized an isoform of NDP kinase that is directed to the matrix space of mitochondria where it is presumably important in integrating metabolism of the adenine and guanine nucleotide pools. A separate isoform, likely encoded by a different gene, is present in the intermembrane space of some mitochondria. Both mitochondrial isoforms are encoded by genes that are different from those for the cytosolic isoforms. The two mitochondrial isoforms have different kinetic properties, which may be anticipated since the intermembrane space form is probably adapted to providing UTP for glycogen synthesis. An emerging picture is that multiple isoforms of NDP kinase are targeted to different regions of the cell where they fulfill distinct metabolic and regulatory roles. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDP 1The abbreviations used are: NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends.1The abbreviations used are: NDP, nucleoside diphosphate; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. kinase) catalyzes the transfer of a phosphoryl group from nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside diphosphates. Interest in this enzyme increased sharply when it was discovered that the awd gene in Drosophila(1Biggs J. Hersperger E. Steeg P.S. Liotta L.A. Shearn A.

Considerable evidence suggests that the NDP kinase protein family has regulatory functions in addition to and perhaps independent of its catalytic activity (4DeLaRosa A. Williams R.L. Steeg P.S.

https://openalex.org/W2034890220,"Initiation of adenovirus DNA replication occurs by a jumping back mechanism in which the precursor terminal priming protein (pTP) forms a pTP·trinucleotide complex (pTP·CAT) catalyzed by the viral DNA polymerase (pol). This covalent complex subsequently jumps back 3 bases to permit the start of chain elongation. Before initiation, pTP and pol form a tight heterodimer. We investigated the fate of this pTP·pol complex during the various steps in replication. Employing <i>in vitro</i> initiation and elongation on both natural viral templates and synthetic oligonucleotides followed by glycerol gradient separation of the reaction products, we established that pTP and pol are separated during elongation. Whereas pTP·C and pTP·CA were still bound to the polymerase, after the formation of pTP·CAT 60% of the pTP·pol complex had dissociated. Dissociation coincides with a change in sensitivity to inhibitors and in<i>K</i> <sub>m</sub> for dNTPs, suggesting a conformational change in the polymerase, both in the active site and in the pTP interaction domain. In agreement with this, the polymerase becomes a more efficient enzyme after release of the pTP primer. We also investigated whether the synthesis of a pTP initiation intermediate is confined to three nucleotides. Employing synthetic oligonucleotide templates with a sequence repeat of two nucleotides (GAGAGAGA … instead of the natural GTAGTA … ) we show that G5 rather than G3 is used to start, leading to a pTP·tetranucleotide (CTCT) intermediate that subsequently jumps back. This indicates flexibility in the use of the start site with a preference for the synthesis of three or four nucleotides during initiation rather than two."
https://openalex.org/W2162580219,"Induced gene expression and subsequent cytokine production have been implicated in the normal tissue injury response to radiotherapy. However, studies of radiation-induced gene expression have used single radiation doses rather than the fractionated exposures typical of the clinical situation. To study the effects of multiple radiation doses on gene expression, we investigated nuclear factor κB (NFκB) DNA binding activity in primary astrocyte cultures after one and two exposures to x-rays. After a single dose of x-rays (3.8–15 gray (Gy)), NFκB binding activity in astrocytes increased in a dose-dependent manner, reaching a maximum by 2–4 h and returning to control levels by 8 h after irradiation. In split-dose experiments, when an interval of 24 h was used between two doses of 7.5 Gy, the second 7.5-Gy exposure failed to induce NFκB activation. The period of desensitization induced by the first radiation exposure was dose-dependent, persisting approximately 72 h after 7.5 Gy compared with 24 h after 1.5 Gy. No changes in IκBα protein levels were detected. However, the presence of a transcription inhibitor prevented the desensitizing effect of the initial irradiation. Irradiation also prevented NFκB activation in astrocytes by a subsequent exposure to H2O2, but it had no effect on the activation induced by tumor necrosis factor-α. These data indicate that an initial x-ray exposure can desensitize astrocytes to the NFκB-activating effects of a subsequent radiation exposure. Furthermore, they suggest that this desensitization depends on gene transcription and may have some specificity for NFκB activation mediated by reactive oxygen species.

It is now well established that ionizing radiation not only kills cells but also alters the expression of specific genes in surviving cells. Among the functional consequences of radiation-induced modulation in gene expression is the increased production of certain cytokines, which has been suggested to be of particular relevance to the normal tissue injury that can result from radiotherapy for cancer (1McBride W.H.

Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5066-5072PubMed Google Scholar). These cytokines have a wide variety of cell type-dependent biological effects, and increases in their production can be expected to influence cells both inside and outside the radiation field. Thus, radiation-induced gene expression and subsequent cytokine production may play a critical role in determining the response of normal tissue to radiotherapy. At present, it is unclear whether the induction of a given cytokine in irradiated cells contributes to a tissue-specific recovery process or is actually involved in the pathogenesis of radiation-induced normal tissue injury. Regardless, modulation of cytokine activity, whether through replacement therapy or the use of inhibitors, represents a potential strategy for the amelioration of the normal tissue injury that can result from radiotherapy.Investigations of radiation-induced gene expression in normal cells and tissues to date have focused primarily on the effects of single doses. In a clinical setting, however, radiotherapy is delivered in multiple fractions. With respect to clonogenic cell death and multiple doses, each dose of radiation can be expected to result in at least the same proportional reduction in cell survival (9Hall E. Radiobiology for the Radiologist. Ed. 4. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1994: 29-44Google Scholar). Regarding induced gene expression, whether the effect of a subsequent radiation dose is the same as that resulting from the first dose has not, to our knowledge, been determined. A reasonable subject for such a study is the transcription factor nuclear factor κ B (NFκB), which plays a major role in regulating genes coding for proteins involved in inflammation and immunity (10Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). In normal cells, ionizing radiation has been shown to activate NFκB in lymphoid cells (11Wilson R.E. Taylor S.L. Atherton G.T. Johnston D. Waters C.M. Norton J.D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3229-3237PubMed Google Scholar, 12Brach M.A. Hass R. Sherman M.L. Gunji H. Weichselbaum R.R. Kufe D. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), fibroblasts (7Brach M.A. Gruß H.-J. Kaisho T. Asano Y. Hirano T. Herrmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8466-8472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and, more recently, endothelial cells (13Hallahan D. Clark E.T. Kuchibhotla J. Gewertz B.L. Collins T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NFκB activation has been found to contribute to TNF-α and interleukin 6 gene transcription induced by ionizing radiation (7Brach M.A. Gruß H.-J. Kaisho T. Asano Y. Hirano T. Herrmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8466-8472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Collart M.A. Baeuerle P. Vassalli P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1498-1506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Considerable information is available concerning the biochemical regulation of NFκB activity (10Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, NFκB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by complexing with the inhibitory protein IκBα. Upon stimulation, IκBα is degraded and NFκB translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to κB sites and regulates the transcription of specific genes. One of the genes that has a κB site in its promoter is IκBα. Thus the activation of NFκB increases the production of IκBα, which then binds to and deactivates free NFκB. Because NFκB activity is subject to this type of negative feedback control, it might be expected that the activation of NFκB by an initial dose of radiation would prevent activation by a second dose.To test this hypothesis, we evaluated NFκB DNA binding in primary cultures of normal rat type 1 astrocytes after one and two doses of x-rays. Type 1 astrocytes are the most prevalent cell type within the central nervous system (CNS) and are a major source of cytokines, proteases, and other types of bioactive molecules (15Montgomery D.L. Vet. Pathol. 1994; 31: 145-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This in vitro model has been used extensively to investigate cytokine production by astrocytes under a variety of environmental and treatment conditions. Moreover, many of the signaling pathways regulating the synthesis of specific cytokines, neurotransmitters, and small molecular weight molecules such as nitric oxide defined in astrocyte cultures have been shown to be operative in vivo (16Muller H.W. Junghans U. Kappler J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1995; 65: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 17McMillian M.R. Thai L. Hong J.-S. O'Callaghan J.P. Pennypacker K.R. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 138-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Of particular relevance to radiation studies, astrocytes are evaluated as confluent cultures, thus eliminating the complicating variables of cell cycle delay and redistribution. The data presented here indicate that, although the first dose of radiation increases NFκB activity in astrocyte cultures, the initial exposure desensitizes astrocytes to the NFκB-inducing actions of a second dose.RESULTSTo characterize the effects of a single x-ray dose on NFκB activity in astrocytes, an EMSA was performed using an oligonucleotide containing a κB site and nuclear extracts from control and irradiated primary astrocyte cultures (Fig. 1). Using this oligonucleotide, three bands were detected (Fig.1 A). To determine which bands corresponded to NFκB binding, 50-fold unlabeled oligonucleotide was included into the reaction mixture (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). The two upper bands disappeared in the presence of the unlabeled oligonucleotide indicative of specific NFκB binding. The lowest band, however, was reduced only slightly under these conditions and was considered to reflect primarily nonspecific binding; the intensity of the nonspecific, lowest band was not altered by irradiation. After a 15-Gy exposure, NFκB binding activity in astrocytes increased in a time-dependent manner. An increase in binding was apparent in the upper two bands at 1 h, reaching a maximum of about a 4-fold induction at 2 h after irradiation and returning to the control level by 8 h. The dose dependence of x-ray-induced NFκB DNA binding activity was determined in astrocyte cultures 2 h after irradiation (Fig. 1 B). Although both the upper and lower bands representing NFκB binding activity increased after irradiation (Fig. 1 A), because of the variability in detecting the less intense lower band in unirradiated cultures, only the upper band was used to quantitate the relative increase in binding activity after radiation exposure. Irradiation with 1.5 Gy had no detectable effect on NFκB binding activity, but beginning at 3.8 Gy, a dose-dependent increase was induced that extended up to at least 15 Gy. These results illustrate that x-rays induce NFκB DNA binding activity in astrocytes in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It should be emphasized that the astrocyte cultures were confluent at the time of irradiation and thus were not subject to the complicating variables of cell cycle redistribution or the expression of clonogenic cell death. Furthermore, no significant cytotoxicity can be detected out to at least 48 h after 20 Gy (19Noel F. Ijichi A. Chen J.J. Gumin G.J. Tofilon P.J. Radiat. Res. 1997; 147: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the NFκB activation observed after astrocyte irradiation occurs in a biologically relevant dose range.Supershift analysis using antibodies to p65 and p50 indicated that the lower band representing NFκB binding activity was composed of p50 homodimers, whereas the upper band consisted of a mixture of p65 homodimers and p65/p50 heterodimers (Fig.2). The presence of p65 homodimers is consistent with a previous report identifying their induction in astrocyte cultures treated with TNF-α (20Diehl J.A. Tong W. Sun G. Hannink M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2703-2707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The c-Fos antibody was included in this analysis as a control for nonspecific interactions.Figure 2Supershift analysis of NFκB-DNA complexes. Astrocytes were exposed to a single dose of 15 Gy, and nuclear extracts were prepared 2 h after treatment. Supershift analysis was performed as described under “Materials and Methods” using the specified antibodies. Lanes 1–6, untreated cells, and lanes 7–12, irradiated cells.

Radiobiology for the Radiologist. Ed. 4. J. B. Lippincott, Philadelphia1994: 29-44Google Scholar). In the study shown in Fig. 3, 15 Gy were divided into two 7.5-Gy doses delivered at an interval of 24 h, a time at which the induced NFκB DNA binding resulting from a single radiation exposure has returned to control levels (see Figs.1 A and 3, lane 6). Nuclear protein extracts were prepared 2 h after the second irradiation and NFκB DNA binding activity was determined. Irradiation of astrocytes with single doses of 7.5 and 15 Gy analyzed at 2 h resulted in approximately 2.5- and 4-fold increases in NFκB binding activity, respectively. However, when 7.5 Gy were followed 24 h later with an additional 7.5 Gy, no significant NFκB activation was detected after the second dose. This loss of activation cannot be attributed to merely a delay in the time course, because the same lack of induced NFκB DNA binding was observed when analyzed out to 8 h after the second irradiation (data not shown). These data suggest that after irradiation there is a refractory period during which the susceptibility of NFκB to activation by a subsequent x-ray exposure is significantly reduced.Figure 3Effect of two x-ray exposures on NFκB DNA binding activity. Astrocytes were irradiated with 7.5 Gy followed 24 h later by a second dose of 7.5 Gy (a total dose of 15 Gy). NFκB DNA binding activity was determined 2 h after the second dose except for lane 6, which was analyzed at 24 h after irradiation. Nuclear protein extraction and EMSA were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lane 2, untreated cells; lanes 3, single dose of 7.5 Gy; lane 4, two doses of 7.5 Gy separated by an interval of 24 h;lane 5, single dose of 15 Gy; lane 6, single dose of 7.5 Gy assayed at 24 h. Brackets indicate specific DNA-protein complexes; the asterisk(*) indicates a nonspecific complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To investigate the dose requirements for inducing this refractory period, astrocytes were exposed to 1.5, 3.8, or 7.5 Gy followed at specified intervals by a second dose of 15 Gy. Nuclear protein extracts were prepared 2 h after the second irradiation, and NFκB DNA binding activity was determined. A representative EMSA obtained after irradiation of astrocytes with 1.5 Gy followed by a subsequent dose of 15 Gy after specified intervals is shown in Fig.4. As in previous experiments, a single dose of 15 Gy increased NFκB binding approximately 4-fold. However, when the 15 Gy were preceded 1–8 h beforehand with a 1.5-Gy exposure, the increase in NFκB activity was markedly reduced. This reduction was maximum when 15 Gy were delivered 2 h after the initial 1.5-Gy exposure, at which time no radiation-induced NFκB activity was detected. In contrast to the data shown in Fig. 3, indicating that after 7.5 Gy the refractory period lasted for at least 24 h, by 4 h after the initial dose of 1.5 Gy, the susceptibility of NFκB to activation by 15 Gy began to return to single exposure levels. The influence of radiation dose on the length of the refractory period is summarized in Fig. 5. After initial doses of 7.5, 3.8, or 1.5 Gy, the susceptibility of NFκB to activation by 15 Gy returned by approximately 72, 36, and 24 h, respectively. These data indicate that the ability of radiation to induce a refractory period or to desensitize astrocytes to NFκB activation by a subsequent irradiation is dose-dependent.Figure 4NFκB DNA binding activity when 1.5 Gy is followed by 15 Gy. Astrocytes were exposed to an initial dose of 1.5 Gy, and after 1–8 h, a second dose of 15 Gy was delivered.

In contrast to actinomycin D, DRB does not intercalate into nucleic acids, but inhibits RNA polymerase II (21Mosman T.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (45530) Google Scholar, 22Hensold J.O. Barth D. Stratton C.A. J. Cell.

This results in a reversible and relatively rapid inhibition of RNA synthesis. Treatment of astrocytes with DRB (100 μm) for 1 h inhibits the incorporation of [3H]uridine into RNA by 90% (data not shown). Astrocytes were exposed to DRB for 1 h before irradiation with 1.5 Gy; 2 h later, the cultures received 15 Gy, and 2 h after that, the nuclear extract was examined for NFκB activity. DRB was present during the entire treatment protocol. Three independent experiments were performed, and a representative EMSA is shown in Fig.6. DRB treatment of astrocytes alone (a total of 5 h) induced a slight increase in NFκB activity (2.3 ± 1.5-fold, mean ± S.E., n = 3), which is probably due to the inhibition of IκBα synthesis, as has been suggested in studies using cycloheximide (25Bertrand F. Philippe C. Antoine P.J. Baud L. Groyer Capeau A. Cherqui G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24435-24441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of astrocytes with DRB had no effect on NFκB activation induced by a single exposure to 15 Gy (4.4 ± 0.6 versus 4.5 ± 0.9 for 15 Gy without DRB). In the absence of DRB, 15 Gy failed to activate NFκB when administered after the initial radiation exposure to 1.5 Gy (lane 4), which is consistent with the data shown in Fig. 4. However, in the presence of DRB, the desensitization was eliminated, and the second radiation exposure induced NFκB activation (lane 5). The activation resulting from the combination of DRB and 1.5 Gy followed by 15 Gy is 9.4 ± 2.8-fold over untreated levels, which is greater than the activation induced by a single dose of 15 Gy (4.5 ± 0.9-fold). It is not possible at this time to determine whether the effect of the combined radiation protocol and DRB is additive or supra-additive. However, these data do indicate that induced gene expression resulting from the first x-ray exposure is required for the desensitization of NFκB activation to the subsequent irradiation.Figure 6The effects of the transcription inhibitor DRB on radiation-induced NFκB DNA binding activity. Astrocytes were exposed to DRB (100 μm) for 1 h before irradiation with 1.5 Gy; 2 h later the cultures were exposed to 15 Gy, and NFκB DNA binding activity was determined 2 h after 15 Gy. DRB was present during the entire treatment protocol (5 h). Lane 13, untreated culture; lane 2, DRB treatment for 5 h;lane 3, 15 Gy only; lanes 4 and 5, the combination of 1.5 and 15 Gy in the absence and presence of DRB, respectively; lane 6, 15 Gy only in the presence of DRB.Brackets indicate specific DNA-protein complexes; theasterisk(*) indicates a nonspecific complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The requirement for gene induction suggested that increases in IκBα levels may be involved in the refractory period after irradiation. It has recently been shown that, in HeLa and lymphoid cell cultures, glucocorticoids inhibit NFκB activity through the induction of IκBα synthesis (26Auphan N. DiDonato J.A. Rosette C. Helmberg A. Karin M. Science. 1995; 270: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (2142) Google Scholar, 27Scheinman R.I. Cogswell P.C. Lofquist A.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1995; 270: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). To determine whether such a scenario might account for the failure of a second radiation dose to increase NFκB activity, IκBα protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis 24 h after irradiation of astrocyte cultures with 1.5 or 7.5 Gy. At this time after the first 7.5 Gy, NFκB activation by a second radiation exposure is essentially eliminated (see Fig. 4). If IκBα was responsible for the ineffectiveness of the second radiation exposure, then the level of this protein would be expected to be elevated at this time. As shown in Fig.7, the IκBα protein level in cultures irradiated with 1.5 or 7.5 Gy was the same as in the unirradiated cultures. Northern blot analysis showed that the IκBα mRNA level was also not affected under these conditions (data not shown). These results suggest that the synthesis of IκBα is unlikely to be involved in the desensitizing actions of the initial irradiation.Figure 7IκBα protein levels in irradiated astrocytes. Astrocyte cultures were exposed to a single dose of 1.5 or 7.5 Gy, and IκBα protein levels were determined 24 h later. Whole-cell extract preparation and Western blotting analysis were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” Molecular mass markers are indicated on the left side.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)NFκB DNA binding is susceptible to induction by a wide variety of stimuli. To determine whether the desensitizing effect also occurs after other activators of NFκB, astrocyte cultures were treated with various combinations of x-rays, H2O2, and TNF-α. H2O2 (100 μm, 1 h) induced NFκB DNA binding with the maximum activation at 4 h post-treatment and returning to untreated levels by 24 h (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 8, exposure of astrocytes to 7.5 Gy 24 h before H2O2treatment eliminated the NFκB activation by H2O2. The same desensitization was induced when H2O2 was followed by x-rays or by a second dose of H2O2 (TableI). Thus, H2O2and ionizing radiation appear to have similar desensitizing effects. A different situation, however, existed for TNF-α. Treatment of astrocytes with TNF-α (1 nm, 1 h) induced NFκB activation by 7-fold, which returned to untreated levels by 24 h post-treatment (data not shown), consistent with previous results (19Noel F. Ijichi A. Chen J.J. Gumin G.J. Tofilon P.J. Radiat. Res. 1997; 147: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In contrast to H2O2, an initial exposure of astrocytes to 7.5 Gy 24 h before TNF-α treatment had no effect on the NFκB activating capability of TNF-α (Fig. 8). When cells were first treated with TNF-α and then exposed to 15 Gy 24 h later, a partial desensitization to radiation activated NFκB resulted (Table I). Interestingly, when TNF-α was followed 24 h later by a second TNF-α exposure, the NFκB activation was essentially the same as that induced by the first treatment. These data suggest that there is some specificity regarding the stimuli that are capable of inducing NFκB desensitization in astrocytes. On a technical note, the failure of radiation to alter NFκB activation by a subsequent TNF-α exposure indicates that the initial irradiation does not modify the solubility of the NFκB complex such that the efficiency of the extraction procedure used in these studies is significantly affected.Figure 8Effect of prior irradiation on NFκB activation induced by x-rays, H2O2 or TNF-α. Astrocytes received a single dose of 7.5 Gy and 24 h later were exposed to 15 Gy, H2O2 (100 μm, 1 h), or TNF-α (1 nm, 1 h). Two hours after 15 Gy, 4 h after H2O2, and immediately after TNF-α treatments, NFκB binding activity was determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Lane 1, untreated culture; lane 2, 15 Gy; lane 3, 7.5 Gy followed by 15 Gy; lane 4, H2O2; lane 5, 7.5 Gy followed by H2O2; lane 6, TNF-α; lane 7, 7.5 Gy followed by TNF-α.

ER HMG-CoA reductase is a 97-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein. A short non-conserved sequence links the multiple transmembrane domain to the highly conserved catalytic domain, which extends out into the cytosol. Because of its role in cholesterol biosynthesis, the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase has been intensely studied. The levels of the ER enzyme are regulated by transcription (5Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S.

Another critical role for this enzyme has emerged in recent years, due to the requirement of farnesyl diphosphate and geranyl-geranyl diphosphate in isoprenylation of proteins (12Maltese W.A. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3319-3328Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Keller et al. (1Keller G.A. Barton M.C. Shapiro D.J. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 770-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) were the first to demonstrate that in the liver HMG-CoA reductase is present not only in the ER but also within the peroxisomes. The function of the peroxisomal reductase in cholesterol/isoprenoid metabolism has yet to be defined. However, it is clear that the ER and peroxisomal HMG-CoA reductases can be regulated differently and, therefore, may play different functional roles (2Keller G.A. Pazirandeh M. Krisans S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,13Rusnak N. Krisans S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 890-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The ER reductase has a diurnal cycle distinct from that of the peroxisomal reductase (13Rusnak N. Krisans S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 890-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, the two reductases can also be regulated coordinately. Both reductase activities are induced by cholestyramine (a bile acid resin) (2Keller G.A. Pazirandeh M. Krisans S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). No information is available regarding the function of the peroxisomal reductase in cholesterol/isoprenoid metabolism, nor has the structure of the peroxisomal HMG-CoA reductase been determined. Accordingly, to facilitate our studies of the function, regulation, and structure of the peroxisomal HMG-CoA reductase, we have identified a mammalian cell line that expresses only one HMG-CoA reductase protein of 90 kDa and that is localized exclusively to peroxisomes. These cells provide a model system to study the peroxisomal HMG-CoA reductase independent of the ER reductase. A detailed characterization and analysis of this cell line is presented in this study. Biochemicals were purchased from Sigma. Electrophoresis supplies, AG1-X8-200–400-mesh formate resin, Zeta Probe GT membrane (used for Northern analysis) and Trans-Blot Transfer Medium (used for Western analysis) were purchased from Bio-Rad. All cell culture media and fetal calf serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Lipoprotein-deficient media were obtained from PerImmune. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A,dl-3[glutaryl-3-14C]- and (RS)-[5-3H]mevalonic acid was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. 125I-Protein A was obtained from Amersham Corp. Cholestyramine (Questran) was obtained from Bristol Laboratories, and mevinolin (Mevacor) was from Merck. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (100–180 g) were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle. Water was given ad libitum, and rats were treated for 7 days with a standard laboratory diet containing 5.0% cholestyramine. Rats were fasted overnight and killed by decapitation 2 h into their light cycle. UT2 cells were obtained from Dr. J. Goldstein. CHO cells were maintained in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media: F12, supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS), fungizone, and Pen/Strep, in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. UT2 cell cultures were maintained in the same media and supplemented with 0.2 mm mevalonate. We also maintained the UT2 cells in the presence of fetal calf serum (10% FCS) but in the absence of mevalonate. After 3 days in media lacking mevalonate more than 25% UT2 cells remained. The surviving UT2 cells were single cell cloned and designated UT2* and maintained in media lacking mevalonate. Cell suspensions were pelleted and washed twice with 20 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and once with homogenization buffer, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% EtOH. Cells were resuspended in homogenization buffer, gently dispersed with two strokes of a glass/Teflon homogenizer, and transferred to a nitrogen cavitation bomb. After a 10-min incubation at 4 °C and 62–63 p.s.i, cells were collected dropwise from the bomb. The suspension was gently homogenized until 80% cell rupture was observed, centrifuged at 750 relative centrifugal field for 5 min, and the pellet resuspended, rehomogenized, and recentrifuged. Supernatants were combined and applied to a linear 20–50% metrizamide gradient. The gradient was centrifuged at 19,000 rpm for 80–90 min in a Sorvall TV850 rotor. Fractions were collected dropwise with a two-way needle. Assays of marker enzymes were performed as described previously (14Biardi L. Sreedhar A. Zokaei A. Vartak N.B. Bozeat R.L. Shackelford J.E. Keller G.-A. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of each fraction were also precipitated with an equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid for immunoblot analysis. Cells were rinsed three times with PBS and scraped into 50 mm KPO4, pH 7.0, containing 200 mm NaCl, 30 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT (KEND) and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm in a Sorvall microcentrifuge for 5 min. Pellets were resuspended in KEND plus 0.2% Triton, 50 μm leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm EGTA and homogenized by hand with 20 strokes with an Eppendorf glass pestle. Extracts were centrifuged for 5 min and supernatants used for determination of protein levels and HMG-CoA reductase activity. Only freshly isolated fractions were assayed. The samples were preincubated for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of substrate, to ensure the inactivation of HMG-CoA lyase activity (2Keller G.A. Pazirandeh M. Krisans S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 875-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The preincubation mixture consisted of 150 μl of KEND buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100–200 μg of protein. After preincubation, the reaction mixture (150 μl), containing 208 μm HMG-CoA and 2 mm NADPH (final concentration) and 20,000 dpm of [3H]mevalonate, in KEND buffer, was added. The samples were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 30 μl of 10.5 n HCl. Control samples lacking either NADPH or enzyme were routinely included. After centrifugation, HMG-CoA was separated from the product (mevalonolactone) by AG 1-X8 formate resin ion exchange columns (15Edwards P.A. Lemongello D. Fogelman A.M. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 40-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also employed thin layer chromatagraphy to separate HMG-CoA and mevalonolactone (16Shapiro D.J. Nordstrom J.L. Mitschelen J.J. Rodwell V.W. Schmke R.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 370: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The results obtained were the same as obtained by use of the formate resin ion exchange columns. Successful separation of the 97-kDa ER reductase from the 90-kDa peroxisomal reductase is dependent upon both the length of the gel and percent of acrylamide. Standard length (12.5 cm) 10% acrylamide gels fail to adequately resolve the two proteins. 10% acrylamide gels that are 16.5 cm in length do provide the required resolution. Alternatively, 12.5-cm gels that are 7.5% acrylamide also give acceptable resolution in this molecular weight range. SDS-gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting was performed as described previously with the following modifications (17Tanaka R.D. Edwards P.A. Lan S.-F. Fogelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13331-13339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Trichloroacetic acid-precipitated proteins were first resuspended in 20 μl of 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 0.1 n NaOH, followed by addition of 130 μl of sample buffer containing 7m urea, 8% SDS, and 1.1 m2β-mercaptoethanol. Cell cultures were rinsed three times with methionine-free and cysteine-free Dulbecco's minimal Eagle's media and preincubated for 1 h in this media. Fresh media were added containing 87.5 μCi/ml [trans-35S]methionine (1227 Ci/mmol), and the cells were incubated for 3 h. Labeled proteins were extracted with buffer containing detergents and protease inhibitors as described (17Tanaka R.D. Edwards P.A. Lan S.-F. Fogelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13331-13339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the extracts were incubated with the indicated anti-HMG-CoA reductase antisera overnight, and immunoprecipitants were isolated on Protein A-Sepharose beads. For competition experiments the anti-peptide G and anti-peptide H antisera were preincubated with the corresponding peptide for 30 min prior to addition to aliquots of the cell extracts. Beads were washed and precipitating proteins were solubilized in the sample buffer as described above. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose, and 35S-labeled proteins were visualized with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager system. The C-terminal (last 15 amino acids) polyclonal HMG-CoA reductase antibody was obtained from Dr. S. Panini (18Straka M.S. Panini S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-peptide G (residues Arg224 through Leu242), anti-peptide H (residues Thr284 through Glu302), HMG-CoA reductase antisera, and the corresponding peptides were obtained from Dr. R. Simoni (19Roitelman J. Olender E.H. Bar-Nun S. Dunn Jr., W.A. Simoni R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 959-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells on coverslips were washed in PBS and fixed in 3.0%p-formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS (also used for subsequent washes). A mixture of mouse HMG-CoA reductase antibody (1:25) and rabbit anti-peroxisomal signal (SKL) IgG antibody (1:200) was used. The cells were washed, and a mixture of secondary reagents consisting of fluorescein conjugate of goat anti-rabbit IgG (heavy + light) antibody (at a final dilution of 1:100) and Texas Red conjugate of goat anti-mouse IgG (heavy + light) antibody (at a final dilution of 1:200) was applied to the coverslips for 60 min. The cells were washed extensively, and the coverslips were mounted on microscope slides for observation with a Nikon fluorescence microscope. UT2* cells were fixed in 3% formaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, and infused with London Resin white acrylic resin (London Resin Co., London). After dehydration with ethanol, thin sections were cut on a Reichert Ultra microtome. Immunolabeled sections were poststained in 2% ethanolic uranyl acetate and observed in a Philips CM12 transmission electron microscope (20McLean I.W. Nakane P.K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1077-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (3200) Google Scholar, 21Keller G.-A. Tokuyase K.T. Dutton A.H. Singer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5744-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The monoclonal HMG-CoA reductase antibody (clone A-9) was obtained from Drs. Brown and Goldsteins' laboratory (6Liscum L. Luskey K.L. Chin D.J. Ho Y.K. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8450-8455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and several polyclonal HMG-CoA reductase antibodies were obtained from Dr. P. Edwards (22Edwards P.A. Lan S.-F. Tanaka R.D. Fogelman A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7272-7275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liver homogenates were first fractionated by differential centrifugation to obtain a peroxisome-enriched fraction, (containing peroxisomes, smaller mitochondria, and microsomes), and a microsomal fraction (14Biardi L. Sreedhar A. Zokaei A. Vartak N.B. Bozeat R.L. Shackelford J.E. Keller G.-A. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homogenization buffer contained 0.25m sucrose, 5 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% EtOH, 1.28 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, 125 ng/ml pepstatin A, 250 ng/ml antipain, 125 ng/ml chymostatin, 50 μm leupeptin, 100 μm PMSF, 20 μm DTT, 2 mm methionine, 15 μg/ml calpain I, 15 μg/ml calpain II, pH 7.5. The peroxisome-enriched fraction was then further purified by equilibrium density centrifugation on a linear Nycodenz (20–45% (w/w)) gradient (14Biardi L. Sreedhar A. Zokaei A. Vartak N.B. Bozeat R.L. Shackelford J.E. Keller G.-A. Krisans S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1197-1205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The gradient contained all of the above protease inhibitors except PMSF, DTT, and methionine. Isolated peroxisomes were at least 94% pure as determined by marker enzyme distribution and contained <1% mitochondrial contamination and 3–6% microsomal protein. Total RNA was extracted from 80% confluent cultured cells as described (23Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63228) Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated using Collaborative Biochemical type 3 oligo(dT)-cellulose, and Northern blots were performed using standard molecular biology protocols. Gels were run at 65 V for 18 h. Blots were hybridized at 42 °C and washed at 55 °C with 0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS. Probes were labeled according to Boehringer Mannheim Nick Translation kit with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp.) and purified using Stratagene Nuctrap protocol. UT2 cells are a mutant clone of CHO cells that require cholesterol and low levels of mevalonate for growth due to a deficiency of the 97-kDa ER HMG-CoA reductase (24Mosley S.T. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13875-13881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line has been stable for over 12 years, and the calculated spontaneous reversion rate is less than 1.5 × 10−7 (24Mosley S.T. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13875-13881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the UT2 cells have some HMG-CoA reductase activity, which is “bona fide” because the activity is totally inhibited when a competitive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (compactin) is added to the assay mixture (24Mosley S.T. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13875-13881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes of the cholesterol synthesis pathway preceding and following HMG-CoA reductase are normal, thus the UT2 cells are only deficient in HMG-CoA reductase (24Mosley S.T. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13875-13881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified the mutation in the ER reductase gene responsible for this defect. 2W. H. Engfelt, K. Masuda, V. G. Paton, and S. K. Krisans, manuscript in preparation. The UT2 cells contain a mutation in the 5′ splice junction between exons 11 and 12. This results in exon 11 skipping and insertion of stop codons. Thus, this mutation prevents the production of the 97-kDa ER HMG-CoA reductase. We maintained the UT2 cells (3.5 × 106) in the presence of fetal calf serum (10% FCS) but in the absence of mevalonate. After 3 days in media lacking mevalonate, more than 25% of the UT2 cells remained. The surviving UT2 cells were single cell cloned and exhibited a marked increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity compared with that measured in UT2 cells cultured in the presence of mevalonate. The UT2 cells grown in the absence of mevalonate are designated UT2*. Fig. 1 compares the reductase activities of UT2, UT2*, and CHO cells maintained for 24 h in the presence of 5% FCS, 5% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) or in the presence of LPDS plus 0.5 μm lovastatin (I), a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase activity, which induces synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase in vivo. The HMG-CoA reductase activity of UT2 cells was 2.0 pmol/min/mg of whole cell extract, compared with 80 pmol/min/mg for UT2* cells, in the presence of LPDS, and 200 pmol/min/mg for UT2* cells in the presence of LPDS plus 0.5 μm lovastatin, reflecting a 40–100-fold increase over the levels observed in UT2 cells. As expected, the HMG-CoA reductase activity in CHO cells is down-regulated by the addition of FCS and up-regulated by the addition of LPDS, and further increased by the addition of LPDS and lovastatin (I). Very similar regulation is observed in the UT2* cells. When whole cell extracts of CHO cells (prepared in the presence of 50 μm leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 5 mm EGTA) were immunoblotted for HMG-CoA reductase, two proteins reacted with the reductase antibody, one of identical mobility to the 97-kDa ER reductase and a second protein at 90-kDa (Fig.2). However, in whole cell extracts from the UT2* cells (treated identically), we only observed the 90-kDa protein band, which was found at elevated levels compared with the 90-kDa band in CHO cells. UT2 whole cell extracts contained no visible protein band reacting with the reductase antibodies (data not shown), consistent with previous reports (24Mosley S.T. Brown M.S. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13875-13881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 3, the amount of the 97-kDa HMG-CoA reductase protein in CHO cells and the 90-kDa protein in UT2* cells was reduced by the addition of FCS and up-regulated by the addition of LPDS to the media. The protein levels were increased further by the addition of LPDS + lovastatin (I). The levels of the 90-kDa protein in CHO cells were also regulated. The levels of the 97-kDa protein in CHO and the 90-kDa protein in UT2* cells correlated with the reductase activity within each cell line, as illustrated in Fig. 1. We utilized density gradient centrifugation to determine whether the 90-kDa HMG-CoA reductase protein is localized to the ER or peroxisomes. UT2* cell organelles were isolated from a post-nuclear fraction on a metrizamide linear gradient. Fig.4 illustrates one of three typical gradients. The separation of endoplasmic reticulum (as determined by cytochrome c reductase), peroxisomes (as determined by catalase), and the distribution of HMG-CoA reductase activity is shown. As can be seen from the catalase distribution, the majority of the intact peroxisomes are found at the dense end (right) of the gradient, well separated from the peak ER fractions. A portion of the catalase activity is solubilized, as a result of rupture of the peroxisomes during the isolation procedure and migrates at the light end of the gradient. The distribution of HMG-CoA reductase activity parallels the distribution of the peroxisomal marker, catalase. The cytosolic fraction is located at the light end of the gradient, and the mitochondrial fraction is also well separated from the peroxisomal fractions (data not shown). In contrast to UT2* cells, CHO cell HMG-CoA reductase activity was localized to both the ER and peroxisomes. Fig.5 illustrates the separation of the organelles in CHO cells. One of three typical gradients is represented. There is a slight contamination of the peroxisomal fractions by the ER, as indicated by the distribution of cytochrome c reductase (panel A). HMG-CoA reductase activity is localized both in the peak ER fractions as well as the peak peroxisomal fractions (panel C). Fig. 6 shows the results of a typical study in which the density gradient fractions from UT2* and CHO cells were analyzed for both HMG-CoA reductase activity and protein (immunoblot). The results clearly demonstrate that UT2* cells (panel A) express an HMG-CoA reductase that is both localized to the peroxisomes and is smaller in size than that observed in the ER (fractions 5–8) of normal CHO cells (panel B). Immunoblots of the fractions from CHO cells (panel B) demonstrate that a 97-kDa HMG-CoA reductase is predominantly localized to ER fractions with some contamination in peroxisomal fractions. In contrast, the 90-kDa HMG-CoA reductase is localized exclusively to the peroxisomal fractions (fractions 13–15). To demonstrate localization of the organelles on the gradient, equal volumes of the fractions (instead of equal protein) were loaded on the gel. This resulted in a slight downward shift of the 97-kDa protein in the ER fractions 5–8, in panel B, due to the high levels of protein in these fractions. In addition, there is an excellent correlation with reductase activity and immunoblot density levels in both cell lines. The known 97-kDa ER HMG-CoA reductase protein was not observed in any fraction in the UT2* cells (panel A). To verify further the subcellular localization of HMG-CoA reductase in UT2* cells, we examined the immunofluorescence pattern obtained with an HMG-CoA reductase antibody. CHO cells and UT2* cells were simultaneously labeled for HMG-CoA reductase and for peroxisomal proteins. A rabbit polyclonal antibody made against the peroxisomal targeting signal (SKL, at the C terminus) was used to label peroxisomal proteins. The SKL antibody has been shown to be specific for peroxisomal proteins (26Gould S.J. Krisans S. Keller G.A. Subramani S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The immunofluorescence pattern obtained for HMG-CoA reductase in CHO cells (Fig.7, panel A) was consistent with ER labeling; however, the pattern obtained for HMG-CoA reductase in UT2* cells was consistent with peroxisomal labeling (Fig. 7,panel B). The majority of the immunofluorescence pattern of HMG-CoA reductase in UT2* cells was directly superimposable over that for the peroxisomal targeting signal antibody (arrowheads inpanels B and D). We also observe some co-localization of HMG-CoA reductase labeling with that of the peroxisomal marker in the CHO cells (arrowheadsin Fig. 7, panels A and C). These results indicate that, in CHO cells, HMG-CoA reductase is localized to both the ER and peroxisomes. In contrast, in UT2* cells, HMG-CoA reductase appears to be exclusively localized to peroxisomes. To further confirm the localization of HMG-CoA reductase to peroxisomes in UT2* cells, these cells were processed for immunoelectron microscopy. As expected, indirect gold immunolabeling for catalase showed specific immunolabeling of peroxisomes (Fig. 8,panel A). Panel B, demonstrates the localization of HMG-CoA reductase to a similar organelle, utilizing a polyclonal HMG-CoA reductase antibody. The immunolabeling is restricted to the matrix of organelles that morphologically resemble peroxisomes. To unambiguously determine that HMG-CoA reductase is contained in the peroxisomes, we also performed double labeling experiments using both rabbit anti-catalase and a monoclonal antibody against HMG-CoA reductase. Panel C shows that 5-nm gold particles representing antigenic sites for HMG-CoA reductase (arrowheads) are present in catalase-positive organelles (10-nm gold particles), demonstrating the co-localization of catalase and HMG-CoA reductase to the same organelle, and confirming the localization of HMG-CoA reductase to peroxisomes. The small peroxisome in panel C shows immunolabeling for catalase but not for HMG-CoA reductase. Taken together, all of the above data indicate that UT2* cells contain an HMG-CoA reductase localized only to the peroxisomes. When peroxisomal fractions are isolated from UT2 cells (suppressed conditions) and immunoblotted for HMG-CoA reductase, a 90-kDa protein band and HMG-CoA reductase activity can also be detected in the peak peroxisomal fractions (Fig. 9,fractions 13–15). However, since in the UT2 cells the reductase is not up-regulated, the levels of the reductase protein are very low. We tested the abilities of a number of HMG-CoA reductase antibodies to immunoprecipitate the 90-kDa protein from UT2* cells, as well as the 97- and 90-kDa proteins from CHO cells (Fig. 10 , panel A). The polyclonal, anti-C-terminal, anti-G peptide, and the anti-H peptide antibodies all immunoprecipitated the 97- and 90-kDa proteins from 35S-labeled CHO cell lysates and the 90-kDa protein from 35S-labeled UT2* cell lysates. These proteins were specifically precipitated as they were competed by an excess of the corresponding free peptides (Fig. 10, panels B andC). Clearly, the 90-kDa protein is antigenically similar to the ER HMG-CoA reductase and must contain multiple conserved antigenic sites. To determine if a precursor-product relationship existed between the 97- and 90-kDa bands in CHO cells, a pulse-chase experiment was performed in CHO cells (Fig. 11). The results indicate that there is no precursor-product relationship between the 97- and 90-kDa reductase proteins. The data are expressed as the percentage of HMG-CoA reductase remaining at each time point. The estimated half-life from the slope of the 97-kDa band agreed well with published reports (18Straka M.S. Panini S.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 317: 235-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and the estimated half-life of the 90-kDa band in CHO cells appears to be similar. Successful and reproducible separation of the 97- and 90-kDa reductase proteins requires specific conditions that include the presence of 7 m urea, 8% SDS, and 1.1m 2-mercaptoethanol in the sample buffer, and either 10% acrylamide gels that are 16.5 cm in length or 7.5% acrylamide gels that are 12.5 cm in length.

By analyzing the RanGAP activity of a series of recombinantly expressed rna1p mutant derivatives, we show that the highly acidic sequence in the C-terminal domain of both yeast proteins is indispensable for activating Ran-mediated GTP hydrolysis. Chemical cross-linking reveals that the same sequence in rna1p is required for rna1p·Ran complex formation indicating that the loss of GAP activity in the C-terminally truncated rna1p mutants results from an impaired interaction with Ran.

Two of these factors form a heterodimeric complex serving as the NLS receptor. The smaller 60-kDa subunit of this complex, also known as importin α, is responsible for NLS binding, whereas the larger 97-kDa subunit, importin β, most likely mediates a targeting of the substrate-NLS receptor complex to the NPC. After docking the entire substrate-receptor complex is thought to travel through the NPC and then to dissociate close to or at the nucleoplasmic side of the pore (for review see Ref. 11Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). The two other factors identified in the in vitro transport system as essential components of the nuclear import machinery are the GTP-binding protein Ran/TC4 (herein referred to as Ran (12Moore M.S. Blobel G. Nature. 1993; 365: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar, 13Melchior F. Paschal B. Evans J. Gerace L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1649-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar)) and a small protein of 10 kDa, p10/NTF2. The latter can interact with NPC proteins, Ran, and importin β and appears to be involved in the formation of a pentameric complex including p10, Ran in its GDP-bound form, the two NLS receptor subunits and a nuclear pore protein (14Paschal B.M.

Drivas G. D'Eustachio P. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The GTP/GDP cycle is regulated by two auxiliary proteins, a GTPase activating protein (GAP) which stimulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ran by several orders of magnitude and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor which markedly accelerates the GTP for GDP exchange rate on Ran. The only guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ran known to date is the nuclear protein RCC1, whereas the only RanGAP identified so far is a cytosolic protein (17Bischoff R. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10830-10834Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 18Dasso M. Trends Biochem.

The strictly compartmentalized organization of the two principle regulators, RanGAP and RCC1, indicates that Ran shuttles between the cytoplasm and the nucleus to interact with its regulator proteins and that a gradient of Ran·GTP exists across the nuclear envelope (for review see Refs. 10Panté N. Aebi U. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 21Sazer S.

Accordingly it has been suggested that Ran·GDP is the active form of the protein at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore and that GTP-bound Ran is required to terminate translocation at the nucleoplasmic side with the Ran·GDP/GTP cycle providing directionality of transport. Evidence for this model includes the findings that Ran·GDP can bind to the NPC via its interaction with p10/NTF2, that a Ran mutant locked in the GTP-bound state fails to support nuclear protein import and prevents docking of an import substrate at the NPC, and that Ran·GTP can bind to importin β thereby inducing the dissociation of importin α from importin β and most likely the termination of translocation (15Nehrbass U.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae andSchizosaccharomyces pombe, these genes encode the Ran homologues Gsp1p and spi1p (25Belhumeur P. Lee A. Tam R. DiPaolo T. Fortin N. Clark M.W. Mol. Cell.

Often, mutations in these genes cause a number of different defects including an inhibition of both nuclear protein import and RNA export. Such pleiotropism is particularly pronounced in S. cerevisiae cells carrying temperature-sensitive mutations in theRNA1 gene which were first described by Hartwell (30Hartwell L.H. J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1662-1670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) 3 decades ago. Only recently it was shown that Rna1p acts as a GAP for Gsp1p and participates in protein import into S. cerevisiaenuclei both in vitro and in vivo (20Bischoff F.R. Krebber H. Kempf T. Hermes I.

Chem. 1995; 270: 11860-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and in contrast to S. cerevisiaeRna1p also stimulates the GTP hydrolysis mediated by human Ran (23Görlich D.

In the yeast proteins, the acidic sequence is followed by a C-terminal stretch of 12 (S. pombe) or 15 (S. cerevisiae) residues capable of forming an amphipathic α-helix, whereas the C-terminal sequences in the mammalian proteins are much longer (189 and 191 residues in RanGAP and Fug1, respectively) and not related to Rna1p/rna1p (20Bischoff F.R.

Limited proteolysis revealed that in S. pombe rna1p the LRRs form a relatively stable domain, whereas the acidic region appears more flexible and susceptible to limited digestion (34Haberland J. Gerke V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). LRRs that are typically 22–29 amino acids in length have been identified in a number of functionally unrelated proteins and have been proposed to mediate protein-protein interactions (for review see Ref. 35Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar).To identify protein domains mediating RanGAP activity of the yeast rna1/Rna1 proteins, we generated a series of rna1p/Rna1p mutant derivatives. Biochemical analysis of these mutants reveals that the acidic C-terminal region is indispensible for full GAP activity of rna1p. Cross-linking experiments which for the first time enabled the visualization of rna1p-Ran·GTP complexes show that it is this C-terminal sequence which is required for rna1p·Ran complex formation and that the LRR domain by itself is not capable of Ran binding. This unexpected finding suggests that the LRR domain of rna1p could be available for additional protein interactions thereby possibly directing the RanGAP activity to the nuclear pore.RESULTSAlthough the actual sequence identity between the two yeast RanGAPs, S. pombe rna1p and S. cerevisiae Rna1p, is limited to 42%, expression of the S. pombe protein in the rna1-1 S. cerevisiae mutant strain complements the temperature-sensitive defect in the RNA1 gene (29Melchior F. Weber K. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This functional equivalence is reflected by the highly conserved domain structure of the two proteins as both comprise (from N- to C-terminal end) the LRR domain, the highly acidic region, and a short amphipathic α-helix. To probe this domain structure of the yeast rna1 proteins with respect to its importance for the function of the proteins as RanGAPs, we generated a series of rna1p mutant derivatives and analyzed their GAP activity and their mode of interaction with Ran. In this analysis we concentrated on features of the C-terminal domains of proteins by progressively truncating C-terminal sequences (Fig.1).Preparation of C-terminally Truncated rna1p/Rna1p DerivativesThe rna1/Rna1 mutant proteins were expressed and purified following a protocol developed for wild-type S. pombe rna1p (29Melchior F. Weber K. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 34Haberland J. Gerke V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Purification involved ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatography on DE52 and MonoQ (Fig.2). Due to progressive deletions of the acidic C-terminal domain in the shorter rna1p/Rna1p derivatives, the respective mutant proteins showed different chromatography properties and were eluted from the MonoQ resin at lower salt concentrations. Three of the mutant proteins, S. pombe rna1pΔ330, as well as S. cerevisiae Rna1pΔ378 and Rna1pΔ359 remained insoluble after expression in bacteria and were purified from inclusion bodies (see “Experimental Procedures”). This involved solubilization in 8.5 m urea and subsequent renaturation of the proteins. To ensure that this treatment did not lead to any major conformational alterations in the refolded molecule, the truncated rna1pΔ330 derivative was also generated by limited proteolysis of native S. pombe rna1p. 5 min digestion of the wild-type protein with α-chymotrypsin at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100 yielded a stable 36.5-kDa fragment that could be separated from the undigested protein by ion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2 C). The 36.5-kDa fragment was shown by N-terminal sequence analysis to contain the authentic rna1p N terminus. Moreover, mass spectroscopy revealed a molecular mass of 36,590 Da for the stable fragment. Collectively, these findings show that the chymotryptic fragment comprises the N-terminal 329 amino acids of the protein thus showing the same C-terminal end as the rna1pΔ330 mutant. Since generation of the 36.5-kDa chymotryptic fragment did not involve any urea treatment, the purified 36.5-kDa fragment served as a control in our studies with recombinantly expressed mutant proteins purified from inclusion bodies. In the analyses described below the chymotryptic 36.5-kDa fragment showed properties indistinguishable from those of the recombinantly expressed rna1pΔ330 mutant, thus indicating that the urea treatment and the subsequent renaturation of rna1pΔ330 does not result in significant conformational alterations. This was corroborated by CD spectroscopy of the different mutant derivatives that revealed no significant differences in the degree of α-helicity, e.g.between rna1pΔ375 purified from the soluble protein fraction and rna1pΔ330 mutant purified from inclusion bodies (not shown). Since the differences between these mutant proteins solely lie in the length of their acidic C-terminal extension, the CD analyses also indicate that the C-terminal extension does not contribute significantly to the α-helical content of the entire rna1p molecule.Figure 2Purification of wild-type and mutant rna1/Rna1 proteins expressed in E. coli. The purifications were carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and proteins present in the different fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. S. pombe rna1p (A) and the truncated S. cerevisiae Rna1pΔ393 derivative (D) were isolated as native polypeptides. E. colicells carrying the corresponding expression construct were lysed using a French press, and soluble proteins (A and D;lanes 2) were fractionated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. Proteins soluble in the presence of 60% ammonium sulfate (A and D; lanes 3) were chromatographed on a DE52 column. Fractions containing rna1p/Rna1p (A andD; lanes 4) were pooled and chromatographed on a MonoQ column to yield the pure proteins (A and D; lanes 5). B shows in comparison to wild-type rna1p (lane 2) the accordingly purified S. pombemutants rna1pΔ375, rna1pΔ361, and rna1pΔ341 (lanes 3–5, respectively) as well as the rna1pΔ330 mutant purified from bacterial inclusion bodies (lane 6, see “Experimental Procedures”). A truncated protein identical in length to the rna1pΔ330 mutant was also generated as a native polypeptide by chymotryptic cleavage of rna1p (C). Therefore, purifiedS. pombe rna1p (C; lane 2) was digested with α-chymotrypsin for 5 min to yield the products shown in lane 3. Subsequently, the 36.5-kDa fragment and the undigested wild-type protein were separated on a DE52 column, and the resulting peak fractions were pooled (C; lanes 4 and 5, respectively). Molecular mass markers are shown in lane 1(A–D) of the Coomassie Blue-stained gels.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Activation of Ran-mediated GTP Hydrolysis by Different rna1p MutantsThe effect of the different S. pombe rna1p derivatives on the GTPase activity of Ran was analyzed by comparing the GTP hydrolysis in mixtures containing 1 μm Ran and increasing amounts of the different rna1p mutants (Fig.3). In line with our previous observation (31Becker J. Melchior F. Gerke V. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11860-11865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), 0.1 nm wild-type rna1p increases the GTP hydrolysis by a factor of 40 over the intrinsic rate when initial rates are compared (Fig. 3 A). This value is not affected in the rna1pΔ375 mutant (Fig. 3 A), i.e. an rna1p derivative devoid of 12 residues at the C-terminal end which most likely form an amphipathic α-helix (29Melchior F. Weber K. Gerke V. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 569-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Likewise, Ran-mediated GTP hydrolysis is accelerated to the same extent in the presence of 0.1 nm rna1pΔ361 mutant protein indicating that the C-terminal 30% of the acidic extension and the C-terminal helix are dispensable for full GAP activity (Fig. 3 B). However, when additional portions of the highly acidic region are removed, the ability of rna1p to increase the intrinsic GTP hydrolysis of Ran is significantly impaired. In the case of rna1pΔ341 a 100-fold higher concentration of the mutant derivative as compared with wild-type rna1p (10 nm compared with 0.1 nm) is required to induce measurable GTP hydrolysis over a period of 60 min (Fig.3 C). This effect is even more pronounced in the shortest mutant, rna1pΔ330, whose remaining activity in this GTP hydrolysis assay is almost negligible and indistinguishable from that of the chymotryptic 36.5-kDa fragment (Fig. 3 D).Figure 3GAP activities of wild-type and C-terminally truncated S. pombe rna1 proteins. 1 μmRan complexed with [γ-32P]GTP was incubated at 30 °C with buffer (○; A–D), with 0.1 nm rna1p (•), or with 0.1 nm (▪), 1 nm (▴), or 10 nm (▵) of the respective mutant derivatives. The mutant proteins assayed are rna1pΔ375 (A), rna1pΔ361 (B), and rna1pΔ341 (C). D shows experiments with the rna1pΔ330 mutant (solid lines) and the chymotryptic 36.5-kDa fragment (dashed lines), respectively. GTPase activity was determined as the decrease of nitrocellulose-bound [γ-32P]GTP, and the results are presented as percentage of radioactivity bound to Ran 30 s after addition of the respective GAP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Similar C-terminal truncations were also analyzed using the S. cerevisiae Rna1p as a GAP. Fig. 4shows that the GTPase activity of Gsp1p, the S. cerevisiaehomologue of Ran, is also affected by C-terminal truncations inS. cerevisiae Rna1p. In line with the results obtained with the S. pombe protein the GAP activity of S. cerevisiae Rna1p remains unchanged when the C-terminal α-helix is removed in the Rna1pΔ393 mutant (Fig. 4 A). A truncation of increasing portions of the acidic region, however, results in moderately to greatly reduced GAP activities (in the Rna1pΔ378 and Rna1pΔ359 mutant proteins; Fig. 4, B and C). Taken together these results indicate that the activation of Ran-mediated GTP hydrolysis by rna1p/Rna1p requires the presence of a substantial portion of the highly acidic region in the unique C-terminal extension of the respective RanGAP.Figure 4GAP activities of wild-type and C-terminally truncated S. cerevisiae Rna1 proteins. 1 μm Gsp1p loaded with [γ-32P]GTP was incubated at 30 °C with buffer (○; A–C), with 0.2 nm Rna1p (•; A–C), or with 0.2 nm(□), 0.5 nm (▪), 1 nm (▵), 2 nm (▿), or 20 nm (▾) of the mutant derivatives Rna1pΔ393 (A), Rna1pΔ378 (B), or Rna1pΔ359 (C). GTPase activity was determined as the decrease of nitrocellulose-bound [γ-32P]GTP, and results are given as percentage of the radioactivity bound to Gsp1p 30 s after addition of the respective GAP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next analyzed whether the rna1p mutant derivatives displaying markedly reduced GAP activities had an inhibitory effect on wild-type rna1p in the Ran-GAP reaction. Due to the high molar excess of Ran over rna1p in the GTP hydrolysis assay such an inhibition would be indicative of a functionally important rna1p dimerization, a property suggested for the human RanGAP based on gel filtration analysis (19Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In a series of competition assays we added increasing amounts of the truncated rna1p mutants to mixtures containing 1 μm Ran and 0.1 nm wild-type rna1p and determined the rate of Ran-mediated GTP hydrolysis. Fig. 5 shows representative examples, in this case for competition assays with the rna1pΔ341 mutant. The GAP activity of wild-type rna1p remains unchanged even in the presence of a 200-fold molar excess of rna1pΔ341. This indicates that the truncated mutant protein does not interfere with wild-type rna1p or act on preformed rna1p·Ran complexes in a manner resulting in functional interference.Figure 5GAP activity of S. pombe rna1p in the presence of increasing concentrations of the C-terminally truncated mutant protein rna1Δp341. 1 μm Ran loaded with [γ-32P]GTP was incubated at 30 °C with buffer (○), 0.025 nm rna1p (▪), 0.05 nm rna1p (□), or 0.1 nm rna1p (•). In the latter case (1 μmRan, 0.1 nm rna1p) the reaction was carried out in the absence (•) or presence of 0.025 nm rna1pΔ341 (▵), 0.05 nm rna1pΔ341 (▴), 0.1 nm rna1pΔ341 (×), 0.2 nm rna1pΔ341 (▾), 0.5 nmrna1pΔ341 (⋄), 2 nm rna1pΔ341 (♦), or 20 nm rna1pΔ341 (▿). GTPase activity was determined as decrease of the nitrocellulose-bound [γ-32P]GTP, and results are given as the percentage of radioactivity bound to Ran 30 s after addition of the respective GAP. The individual experiments were carried out at least three times, and curves of a representative experiment are shown. Note that the addition of increasing amounts ot the rna1pΔ341 does not affect the GAP activity of 0.1 nm wild-type rna1p. All curves characterizing the reactions containing 1 μm Ran and 0.1 nmrna1p are nearly identical and partially mask one another.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Complex Formation between Ran and rna1p Is Inhibited in C-terminal rna1p Mutants with Impaired GAP ActivityTwo possible models could explain the findings that C-terminal truncations removing most of the highly acidic region of rna1p markedly impair the ability to active Ran-mediated GTP hydrolysis. First, complex formation between Ran and the rna1p mutant derivative could be impaired and second, complexes between Ran and rna1p mutants form but are functionally inhibited because the C-terminal truncations render the rna1p derivatives enzymatically inactive. To distinguish between these possibilities we analyzed the interaction between Ran and wild-type or mutant rna1p since this interaction should be affected in the case of the former but not the latter model.In a first approach we characterized hydrodynamic properties of rna1p, Ran, and rna1p/Ran mixtures. In this and all subsequent protein interaction analyses we used GMPPNP-loaded Ran, i.e. a Ran molecule fixed in its GTP-bound conformation, as we predicted that only GTP-bound Ran interacts with rna1p. Analytical gel filtration reveals that rna1p shows migration properties corresponding to those of a globular protein of approximately 90 kDa, whereas the migration position of Ran corresponds to that of a globular protein of approximately 20 kDa (not shown). When the two proteins are mixed at an equimolar ratio prior to the molecular sieving chromatography, the migration positions remain unchanged and no other species corresponding to rna1p·Ran complex is observed (Fig.6 A). Moreover, anti-rna1p and anti-Ran immunoblot analysis of the fractions obtained after the gel filtration reveals that Ran is absent from the rna1p peak and vice versa (Fig. 6 A). The migration properties of rna1p are some"

African trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that cause African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, in many tropical regions of Africa. Infective metacyclic stage trypanosomes are transmitted from the tsetse fly to the mammalian bloodstream, where they differentiate into bloodstream organisms that evade the immune response by periodically switching the major protein on their surface, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). 1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; MVAT, metacyclic variant antigen type; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); ESAG, expression site-associated gene; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ELC, expression-linked copy.1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; MVAT, metacyclic variant antigen type; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); ESAG, expression site-associated gene; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ELC, expression-linked copy.Hundreds of different VSGs can potentially be expressed by bloodstream trypanosomes, whereas only 10–15 different VSGs are expressed during the metacyclic stage (1Turner C.M. Barry J.D. Maudlin I. Vickerman K. Parasitology. 1988; 97: 269-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Crowe J.S. Barry J.D. Luckins A.G. Ross C.A. Vickerman K.

VSGs expressed by metacyclic organisms are used to define the metacyclic variant antigen types (MVATs). Many unexpressed bloodstream VSG genes are found in minichromosomes and at internal locations of large chromosomes, whereas the MVAT VSG genes appear to be located exclusively near the telomeres of large chromosomes, independent of their expression status (4Lenardo M.J. Rice-Ficht A.C. Kelly G. Esser K.M. Donelson J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After metacyclic parasites enter the mammalian bloodstream, they continue to express MVAT VSGs for 5–7 days and then change to the expression of a bloodstream VSG followed by periodic VSG switching. Late in the infection, MVAT VSGs are occasionally re-expressed as bloodstream VSGs. The re-expressed MVAT VSG genes are activated by either gene conversion or an unknown activation mechanism in situ (5Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Lu Y. Alarcon C.M. Hall T. Reddy L.V. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5945-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)Expressed VSG genes are invariably located near chromosomal telomeres. The telomere-linked expression sites for bloodstream VSG genes typically consume 45–60 kb and contain (in a 5′ to 3′ direction) a promoter, seven or more expression site-associated genes (ESAGs), a variable number of 70–76-bp repeats, and the VSG gene followed by subtelomeric and telomeric DNA repeats (see Refs. 8Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 9Borst P. Rudenko G. Taylor M.C. Blundell P.A. Van Leeuwen F. Bitter W. Cross M. McCulloch R. Arch. Med. Res. 1996; 27: 379-388PubMed Google Scholar for recent reviews). Thus, transcription of most bloodstream VSG gene expression sites yields polycistronic precursor RNAs containing eight or more protein-coding regions that are processed into mature monocistronic mRNAs. In contrast, the telomere-linked MVAT VSG expression sites do not have a full complement of ESAGs and can be devoid of ESAGs entirely. They also lack multiple copies of the 70–76-bp repeats and are transcribed into monocistronic precursor RNAs from a proximal promoter located within 2 kb of the VSG-coding region (5Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Graham S.V. Barry J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5945-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Recently, we characterized a promoter for the MVAT4 VSG gene ofTrypanosoma brucei rhodesiense utilizing a bloodstream trypanosome clone that re-expresses MVAT4 VSG (5Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In these bloodstream organisms, the telomere-linked MVAT4 VSG gene is activated in situ without a duplication event or other detectable DNA rearrangements. This finding suggests that either (i) the promoter that functions in metacyclic organisms was reactivated in the bloodstream parasites or (ii) two promoters exist in this expression locus, one for expression at the metacyclic stage and one for the bloodstream stage. The simplest of these two possibilities is that the same promoter is responsible for transcription in both metacyclic and bloodstream organisms. Another MVAT VSG gene, encoding MVAT5 VSG, was found to be activated via duplication to a conventional bloodstream expression site whose promoter is far upstream of the VSG gene (6Lu Y. Alarcon C.M. Hall T. Reddy L.V. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3971-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a promoter for the bloodstream expression of a third metacyclic VSG gene, the MVAT7 VSG gene. This gene and its promoter were found to be co-duplicated to a telomere-linked site, which is in contrast to both the in situ activation of the MVAT4 VSG gene and the duplication of the MVAT5 VSG gene to a conventional bloodstream expression site possessing its own promoter. Mutational studies demonstrated that at least two regions within the MVAT7 promoter are important for full promoter function. This promoter gives rise to a monocistronic VSG transcript, differing from the polycistronic transcripts of bloodstream VSG genes, but similar to the promoters for the MVAT4 VSG gene and another metacyclic VSG gene in a different trypanosome serodeme (7Graham S.V. Barry J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5945-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONPreviously, we have examined the bloodstream re-expression of two other single-copy MVAT VSG genes in the same trypanosome serodeme. The MVAT4 VSG gene was found to be activated in situ and transcribed into a monocistronic precursor RNA (5Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell.

The MVAT5 VSG gene was shown to be duplicated and transposed downstream of 70–76-bp repeats at a conventional bloodstream VSG gene expression site, where it is transcribed as part of a large polycistronic precursor RNA (6Lu Y. Alarcon C.M. Hall T. Reddy L.V. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3971-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe the bloodstream activation of the single-copy MVAT7 VSG gene, which is co-duplicated with its own promoter to another telomere-linked site, where it is transcribed into a monocistronic precursor RNA. These different bloodstream re-expression events for the three MVAT VSG genes are summarized in Fig.7. To our knowledge, only one other example of the cotransposition of a VSG gene and a promoter has been reported (31Shea C. Lee M.G.-S. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Cell. 1987; 50: 603-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In that case, the duplicative transposition of a 6.5-kb fragment containing VSG 118 to a telomere-linked expression site appeared to activate a cotransposed promoter on the same fragment that was located ∼3.5 kb upstream of the VSG gene. Subsequent studies, however, indicated that this cotransposed promoter was “subsidiary” to two tandem promoters already in the expression site at locations ∼45 kb upstream of the transposed VSG gene (27Gottesdiener K. Chung H.-M. Brown S.D. Lee M.G.-S. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2467-2480Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 32Johnson P.J. Kooter J.M. Borst P. Cell. 1987; 51: 273-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In the MVAT7 case described here, the nuclear run-on experiments (Fig. 5) demonstrate that no transcription occurs immediately upstream of the cotransposed promoter, indicating that only this promoter is active at this expression site.Although the telomere-linked MVAT4 and MVAT7 VSG genes both give rise to monocistronic precursor RNAs, there are differences in their expression sites. An ESAG I is located ∼5 kb upstream of the MVAT4 VSG gene, whereas a corresponding ESAG is not present in the 7 kb upstream of the basic copy MVAT7 VSG gene. The promoter for the MVAT4 VSG gene was already at its bloodstream expression site prior to its activation, whereas the promoter for the MVAT7 VSG gene arrived at its bloodstream expression site along with the gene. Computer analyses of the sequences of the two expression sites demonstrate that they do not share substantive sequence similarities other than those in the promoters (Fig. 6 A) and the 3′-ends of the VSG genes (data not shown). Despite considerable effort by a number of laboratories, the actual molecular mechanisms that activate the promoter in one telomere-linked expression site and silence all other telomere-linked expression sites remain a mystery. In bloodstream trypanosomes, these mechanisms are likely unrelated to whether the primary transcript of the expression site is polycistronic or monocistronic. Instead, DNA transfection/integration experiments suggest that a form of telomere silencing, similar to that studied in yeast and other organisms, may be a dominant factor regulating VSG gene expression (33Horn D. Cross G.A.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 34Rudenko G. Blundell P.A. Dirks-Mulder A. Kieft R. Borst P. Cell. 1995; 83: 547-553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, the main function of VSG gene rearrangements near telomeres may be to place a VSG gene in an “on deck” location downstream of a sequence that can serve as a promoter when the chromatin structure at that telomere is such that transcription is permitted.Sequence alignment of the six reported promoters for VSG genes led to the identification of a consensus “core” sequence (Fig.6 A). An earlier consensus sequence of bloodstream VSG gene promoters and the PARP promoter, derived by Van der Ploeg and co-workers (26Brown S.D. Huang J. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2644-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), consisted of two conserved regions located at positions −70 to −60 and positions −22 to −10 upstream of the transcription start site. The importance of these two segments was shown experimentally by linker scanning mutagenesis of the PARP promoter. Deletion of either of the two conserved regions had dramatic effects on promoter activity as measured by transient transfection analysis. Similarly, we found that two segments in the MVAT7 promoter, located at positions −49 to −47 and positions −18 to −16, are both necessary for full promoter function. These results are also consistent with experiments in which different segments of the PARP and rRNA promoters were exchanged, indicating that two regions are important for the functioning of the promoters used by the α-amanitin-resistant RNA polymerase(s) in trypanosomes (35Janz L. Clayton C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5804-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, the directed mutations in the MVAT7 promoter (Fig. 6 B) did not give the same results as those obtained when 10-bp linker scanning mutagenesis was conducted on the MVAT4 promoter (5Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In these earlier linker scanning studies, the replacement of each of several different 10-bp segments in the 73-bp MVAT4 promoter with a linker resulted in a loss of >95% of promoter activity. Although the reason for this difference in the outcomes of directed mutagenesis versus linker scanning of the MVAT promoters is not clear, replacing 10-bp segments may have altered additional important sequences in the MVAT4 promoter that were not affected in the directed mutagenesis experiments on the MVAT7 promoter. Thus, the precise introduction of mutations into the trypanosome promoters is likely to be the preferred approach in the future for identifying nucleotides crucial for VSG gene promoter activity.Finally, no nucleotide differences were observed when the MVAT7 VSG cDNA sequence was compared with the genomic sequence of the single-copy MVAT7 VSG gene in trypanosomes expressing other VSGs. Thus, the duplicated MVAT7 expression-linked copy (ELC) gene is a faithful copy of its basic copy donor gene. This scenario differs dramatically from the bloodstream re-expression of the MVAT5 VSG gene, in which each of three independently expressed ELC genes was found to have point mutations in the coding region compared with its donor gene (6Lu Y. Alarcon C.M. Hall T. Reddy L.V. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3971-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear why the duplicative transposition of one telomere-linked donor MVAT VSG gene would be accompanied by point mutations, whereas a similar duplication of another such gene would not, but several possible explanations exist. Perhaps the simplest alternative is that VSG genes can be duplicated by different mechanisms, some of which are more susceptible to point mutations than others. For example, the point mutations of the MVAT5 ELCs occur in the VSG-coding region, but not in the duplicated flanking regions, which might suggest that an RNA intermediate was involved in these duplications and not in duplications of other VSG genes. Recently, other workers specifically investigated whether point mutations occurred during the duplication of the ILTat 1.22 VSG gene in another trypanosome serodeme (36Graham V.S. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). They concluded that although a single-point mutation occurred in one of three independent ELCs of the donor gene, mutagenesis was not a common feature of the duplication of this gene, similar to the case reported here for the MVAT7 ELC. Other recent studies have revealed that, contrary to earlier views, the 70–76-bp repeats do not participate in some VSG conversions (20McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), also similar to what was observed here for the MVAT7 duplication. Thus, it is likely that duplicative transpositions of more VSG genes will need to be examined before the full range of mechanisms responsible for these gene duplications can be appreciated. African trypanosomes are protozoan parasites that cause African trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, in many tropical regions of Africa. Infective metacyclic stage trypanosomes are transmitted from the tsetse fly to the mammalian bloodstream, where they differentiate into bloodstream organisms that evade the immune response by periodically switching the major protein on their surface, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). 1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; MVAT, metacyclic variant antigen type; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); ESAG, expression site-associated gene; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ELC, expression-linked copy.1The abbreviations used are: VSG, variant surface glycoprotein; MVAT, metacyclic variant antigen type; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); ESAG, expression site-associated gene; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; ELC, expression-linked copy.Hundreds of different VSGs can potentially be expressed by bloodstream trypanosomes, whereas only 10–15 different VSGs are expressed during the metacyclic stage (1Turner C.M. Barry J.D. Maudlin I. Vickerman K. Parasitology. 1988; 97: 269-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Crowe J.S. Barry J.D. Luckins A.G. Ross C.A. Vickerman K. Nature. 1983; 306: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 3Esser K.M. Schoenbechler M.J. Gingrich J.B. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 1715-1718PubMed Google Scholar). VSGs expressed by metacyclic organisms are used to define the metacyclic variant antigen types (MVATs). Many unexpressed bloodstream VSG genes are found in minichromosomes and at internal locations of large chromosomes, whereas the MVAT VSG genes appear to be located exclusively near the telomeres of large chromosomes, independent of their expression status (4Lenardo M.J. Rice-Ficht A.C. Kelly G. Esser K.M. Donelson J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After metacyclic parasites enter the mammalian bloodstream, they continue to express MVAT VSGs for 5–7 days and then change to the expression of a bloodstream VSG followed by periodic VSG switching. Late in the infection, MVAT VSGs are occasionally re-expressed as bloodstream VSGs. The re-expressed MVAT VSG genes are activated by either gene conversion or an unknown activation mechanism in situ (5Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 6Lu Y. Alarcon C.M. Hall T. Reddy L.V. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3971-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Graham S.V. Barry J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5945-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) Expressed VSG genes are invariably located near chromosomal telomeres. The telomere-linked expression sites for bloodstream VSG genes typically consume 45–60 kb and contain (in a 5′ to 3′ direction) a promoter, seven or more expression site-associated genes (ESAGs), a variable number of 70–76-bp repeats, and the VSG gene followed by subtelomeric and telomeric DNA repeats (see Refs. 8Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 9Borst P. Rudenko G. Taylor M.C. Blundell P.A. Van Leeuwen F. Bitter W. Cross M. McCulloch R. Arch. Med. Res. 1996; 27: 379-388PubMed Google Scholar for recent reviews). Thus, transcription of most bloodstream VSG gene expression sites yields polycistronic precursor RNAs containing eight or more protein-coding regions that are processed into mature monocistronic mRNAs. In contrast, the telomere-linked MVAT VSG expression sites do not have a full complement of ESAGs and can be devoid of ESAGs entirely. They also lack multiple copies of the 70–76-bp repeats and are transcribed into monocistronic precursor RNAs from a proximal promoter located within 2 kb of the VSG-coding region (5Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Graham S.V. Barry J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5945-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, we characterized a promoter for the MVAT4 VSG gene ofTrypanosoma brucei rhodesiense utilizing a bloodstream trypanosome clone that re-expresses MVAT4 VSG (5Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In these bloodstream organisms, the telomere-linked MVAT4 VSG gene is activated in situ without a duplication event or other detectable DNA rearrangements. This finding suggests that either (i) the promoter that functions in metacyclic organisms was reactivated in the bloodstream parasites or (ii) two promoters exist in this expression locus, one for expression at the metacyclic stage and one for the bloodstream stage. The simplest of these two possibilities is that the same promoter is responsible for transcription in both metacyclic and bloodstream organisms. Another MVAT VSG gene, encoding MVAT5 VSG, was found to be activated via duplication to a conventional bloodstream expression site whose promoter is far upstream of the VSG gene (6Lu Y. Alarcon C.M. Hall T. Reddy L.V. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3971-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe the identification and characterization of a promoter for the bloodstream expression of a third metacyclic VSG gene, the MVAT7 VSG gene. This gene and its promoter were found to be co-duplicated to a telomere-linked site, which is in contrast to both the in situ activation of the MVAT4 VSG gene and the duplication of the MVAT5 VSG gene to a conventional bloodstream expression site possessing its own promoter. Mutational studies demonstrated that at least two regions within the MVAT7 promoter are important for full promoter function. This promoter gives rise to a monocistronic VSG transcript, differing from the polycistronic transcripts of bloodstream VSG genes, but similar to the promoters for the MVAT4 VSG gene and another metacyclic VSG gene in a different trypanosome serodeme (7Graham S.V. Barry J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5945-5956Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONPreviously, we have examined the bloodstream re-expression of two other single-copy MVAT VSG genes in the same trypanosome serodeme. The MVAT4 VSG gene was found to be activated in situ and transcribed into a monocistronic precursor RNA (5Alarcon C.M. Son H.J. Hall T. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5579-5591Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The MVAT5 VSG gene was shown to be duplicated and transposed downstream of 70–76-bp repeats at a conventional bloodstream VSG gene expression site, where it is transcribed as part of a large polycistronic precursor RNA (6Lu Y. Alarcon C.M. Hall T. Reddy L.V. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3971-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we describe the bloodstream activation of the single-copy MVAT7 VSG gene, which is co-duplicated with its own promoter to another telomere-linked site, where it is transcribed into a monocistronic precursor RNA. These different bloodstream re-expression events for the three MVAT VSG genes are summarized in Fig.7. To our knowledge, only one other example of the cotransposition of a VSG gene and a promoter has been reported (31Shea C. Lee M.G.-S. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Cell. 1987; 50: 603-612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In that case, the duplicative transposition of a 6.5-kb fragment containing VSG 118 to a telomere-linked expression site appeared to activate a cotransposed promoter on the same fragment that was located ∼3.5 kb upstream of the VSG gene. Subsequent studies, however, indicated that this cotransposed promoter was “subsidiary” to two tandem promoters already in the expression site at locations ∼45 kb upstream of the transposed VSG gene (27Gottesdiener K.

This scenario differs dramatically from the bloodstream re-expression of the MVAT5 VSG gene, in which each of three independently expressed ELC genes was found to have point mutations in the coding region compared with its donor gene (6Lu Y. Alarcon C.M. Hall T. Reddy L.V. Donelson J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3971-3980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is not clear why the duplicative transposition of one telomere-linked donor MVAT VSG gene would be accompanied by point mutations, whereas a similar duplication of another such gene would not, but several possible explanations exist. Perhaps the simplest alternative is that VSG genes can be duplicated by different mechanisms, some of which are more susceptible to point mutations than others. For example, the point mutations of the MVAT5 ELCs occur in the VSG-coding region, but not in the duplicated flanking regions, which might suggest that an RNA intermediate was involved in these duplications and not in duplications of other VSG genes. Recently, other workers specifically investigated whether point mutations occurred during the duplication of the ILTat 1.22 VSG gene in another trypanosome serodeme (36Graham V.S. Barry J.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 35-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). They concluded that although a single-point mutation occurred in one of three independent ELCs of the donor gene, mutagenesis was not a common feature of the duplication of this gene, similar to the case reported here for the MVAT7 ELC. Other recent studies have revealed that, contrary to earlier views, the 70–76-bp repeats do not participate in some VSG conversions (20McCulloch R. Rudenko G. Borst P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), also similar to what was observed here for the MVAT7 duplication. Thus, it is likely that duplicative transpositions of more VSG genes will need to be examined before the full range of mechanisms responsible for these gene duplications can be appreciated. We thank Ted Hall for providing the MVAT7 re-expressor clone, Etienne Pays for sharing the nuclear run-on protocol, Mike Lenardo for performing some of the early experiments, and Clara Alarcon for advice and help throughout the project."
https://openalex.org/W1992501051,"The receptor-binding factor (RBF) for the avian oviduct progesterone (Pg) receptor (PR) has previously been shown to be a unique 10-kDa nuclear matrix protein that generates high affinity PR-binding sites on avian DNA. This paper describes the use of Southwestern blot and DNA gel shift analyses with RBF protein to identify a minimal 54-base pair RBF-binding element in the matrix-associated region (MAR) of the Pg-regulated c-mycgene promoter. This element contains a 5′-GC-rich domain and a 3′-AT-rich domain, the latter of which has a homopurine/homopyrimidine structure. The gel shift assays required the generation of an RBF-maltose fusion protein (RBF-MBP), which specifically binds this element and is supershifted when the anti-RBF polyclonal antibody is added. Computer analysis of the full-length amino acid sequence for RBF predicts a DNA-binding motif involving a β-sheet structure at the N-terminal domain. Southern blot analyses using nuclear matrix DNA suggests that there are dual MAR sites in the c-mycpromoter, which flank an intervening domain containing the RBF element. The co-transfection of this MAR sequence, containing the RBF element and cloned into a luciferase reporter vector, together with an RBF expression vector construct, into steroid treated human MCF-7 cells, results in a decrease of the c-myc promoter activity relative to control transfections containing only the parent vector of the RBF expression construct. These data suggest that a unique chromatin/nuclear matrix structure, composed of the RBF-DNA element complex which is flanked by nuclear matrix attachment sites, serves to bind the PR and repress the c-myc promoter.

The classic model of steroid hormone action suggests that ligand-bound receptors dimerize and bind to specific sites (acceptor sites) on the chromatin/DNA to alter gene expression. In many genes, the steroid receptors (SR) 1The abbreviations used are: SR, steroid receptor; bp, base pair(s); CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)propanesulfonic acid; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; E2, 17β-estradiol; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ICI, ICI 182,780, a pure antiestrogen (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals); MAR, nuclear matrix-associated region; MBP, maltose-binding protein; pAb, polyclonal antibody; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; Pg, progesterone; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PR, progesterone receptor; RBF, receptor-binding factor; SAR, scaffold attachment region; Tricine,N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylglycine.bind to specific cis-acting DNA sequences, referred to as hormone response elements (for reviews, see Refs. 1Green S.

These elements function as enhancer-like DNA sequences and are required for the steroid hormone regulation of transcription. However, not all steroid-responsive genes contain these elements, and several other pathways and participating nuclear proteins have now been identified. The SR regulation of gene transcription has now been shown to involve 1) interactions of the SR with transcription factors, such as the AP-1 complex (for review, see Refs. 2Bagchi M.K. Tsai M.J.

In the latter, a class of high affinity binding sites (acceptor sites) for SRs in the nuclei, chromatin, and nuclear matrix DNA-binding proteins (e.g. acceptor proteins) has been reported by many laboratories for most of the steroid hormone receptor systems (for reviews, see Refs. 12Rories C.

Studies in many laboratories using a variety of steroid systems have localized the nuclear binding (acceptor) sites for SR to the nuclear matrix. These studies include estrogens and androgens (10Barrack E.R. J. Steroid Biochem. 1987; 27: 115-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 17Barrack E.R. Coffey D.S. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9516-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Previous studies in our laboratory revealed that chromatin acceptor sites for the avian oviduct progesterone receptor (PR) were associated with the nuclear matrix as was the receptor-binding factor (RBF) (23Schuchard M. Subramaniam M. Ruesink T. Spelsberg T.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9516-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 24Schuchard M. Landers J.P. Punkay-Sandhu N. Spelsberg T.C. Endocr.

In short, the chromatin and nuclear matrix acceptor sites appear to be one and the same. We have purified the nuclear matrix RBF (formerly termed a chromatin “acceptor” protein) based on its ability to generate specific, high affinity PR binding when renatured and bound to the avian genomic DNA (12Rories C. Spelsberg T.C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1989; 51: 653-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Schuchard M. Rejman J.J. McCormick D.J. Gosse B. Ruesink T. Spelsberg T.C.

Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 651-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Using immunohistochemical techniques with antibodies against the purified RBF, the RBF was localized to the nuclei of selected cell types in certain avian and rat tissues (27Zhuang Y.-H. Landers J.P. Schuchard M.D. Syvälä H. Gosse B. Ruesink T. Spelsberg T.C. Tuohimaa P. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 28Landers J.P. Subramaniam M. Gosse B. Weinshilboum R. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell Biochem. 1994; 55: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In similar studies, co-localizations of RBF and PR in the same cell types in the avian oviduct and rat reproductive organs were also shown. The full-length cDNA to RBF has been cloned and used to identify a 0.7-kilobase mRNA in specific avian tissues. The mRNA levels in these same tissues correlate with the RBF protein levels by Western blot analyses (28Landers J.P. Subramaniam M. Gosse B. Weinshilboum R. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell Biochem. 1994; 55: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). A homologous RBF-like mRNA species was identified in human tissues. 2T. J. Barrett, A. H. Lauber, M. Subramaniam, M. Schuchard, and T. C. Spelsberg, manuscript in preparation. Earlier studies had indicated that specific DNA sequences were important when generating RBF/PR-binding sites. The PR-binding sites could only be generated when the purified RBF was bound to mammalian genomic DNA, but not when the RBF was complexed to prokaryotic, or lower eukaryotic genomic DNAs (29Toyoda T. Seelke R. Littlefield B.A. Spelsberg T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4722-4726Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 30Spelsberg T.C. Goldberger A. Horton M. Hora J. J. Steroid Biochem. 1987; 27: 133-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The PR-binding sites could also be generated with the genomic sequences of the c-myc gene but not those of the ovalbumin gene (31Spelsberg T.C. Horton M. Fink K. Goldberger A. Rories C. Gosse B. Rasmussen K. Recent Advances in Steroid Hormone Action. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin1987: 31-48Google Scholar). Past studies in our laboratory demonstrated that the steady state levels of mRNA and the transcription rates of several nuclear proto-oncogenes, c-myc, c-fos, and c-jun, in the avian oviduct are rapidly regulated in vivo by Pg, glucocorticoids, and estrogen (24Schuchard M.

Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 2049-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These nuclear proto-oncogenes have also been shown to be regulated by steroids in many other animal systems (37Dubik D. Dembinski T.C. Shiu R.P.C. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 6517-6521PubMed Google Scholar, 38Murphy L.J. Murphy L.C. Friesen H.G.

Vig E. Vedeckis W.V. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9746-9753Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, Southern blot analyses revealed that the DNase-resistant nuclear matrix DNA had sequence homology with sequences in the 5′-ends of the steroid-regulated c-myc and the c-jun proto-oncogenes but not to genomic sequences of some other genes in the avian oviduct, suggesting that nuclear matrix is attached to 5′-flanking regions of those genes (23Schuchard M. Subramaniam M. Ruesink T. Spelsberg T.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9516-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, a model is emerging, whereby the RBF-containing nuclear matrix is associated with c-myc and other proto-oncogene promoters and generates PR-binding sites (acceptor sites) through which steroids might regulate the transcription of these genes. It should be noted here that other nuclear matrix proteins have been reported to bind to promoter domains and alter gene expression (44Bidwell J.P. van Wijnen A.J. Fey E.G. Dworetzky S. Penman S. Stein J.L. Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3162-3166Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 45Stein G.S. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L. Lian G.B. Bidwell J.P. Montecino M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 4-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To challenge this model, it was necessary to determine whether RBF binds to a specific element in or near the same nuclear matrix attachment site in the c-myc 5′-flanking domain. This paper demonstrates that the RBF does bind to a specific DNA element within this nuclear matrix attachment site in the 5′-flanking domain of the avian c-myc gene. Further, the nuclear matrix is shown to attach to each side of this RBF-binding element. Primary sequence analyses of the RBF reveals structural motifs resembling other DNA-binding proteins. Preliminary studies show that the overexpression of RBF in transiently transfected human breast cancer cells inhibits reporter gene activity when the reporter gene construct contains the 1021-bp region of the c-myc promoter. The treatment of these cells with steroids ensures this inhibition. Thus, the RBF and steroid hormones may regulate c-myc gene promoter activity via this 1021-bp region of the promoter that contains the RBF element and nuclear matrix attachment sites. Hen oviduct was excised and the chromatin isolated. Chromosomal proteins were size-fractionated by molecular sieve chromatography as described previously (46Goldberger A. Spelsberg T.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2103-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fractions containing proteins in the 4–20-kDa size range were pooled and separated by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a Tris-Tricine buffer as described previously (28Landers J.P. Subramaniam M. Gosse B. Weinshilboum R. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell Biochem. 1994; 55: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The gel was transferred to six sheets of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a CAPS buffer system (10 mm CAPS + 10% methanol, pH 11.0). The sixth sheet was immunostained for RBF utilizing a RBF-specific monoclonal antibody (22Schuchard M. Rejman J.J. McCormick D.J. Gosse B. Ruesink T. Spelsberg T.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4535-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,46Goldberger A. Spelsberg T.C. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 2103-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 47Goldberger A. Littlefield B.A. Katzmann J. Spelsberg T.C. Endocrinology. 1986; 118: 2235-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The five additional sheets were matched against the one with the visible immunoproduct. Bands encompassing RBF were excised, and the protein was eluted from the membrane in 70% (v/v) 2-propanol, 5% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) overnight; dialyzed against 5% (v/v) acetonitrile/H2O, 0.25 mm PMSF, and lyophilized. This protocol was tested and reported in detail (22Schuchard M. Rejman J.J. McCormick D.J. Gosse B. Ruesink T. Spelsberg T.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4535-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar,28Landers J.P. Subramaniam M. Gosse B. Weinshilboum R. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell Biochem. 1994; 55: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This method has been described in detail previously (22Schuchard M. Rejman J.J. McCormick D.J. Gosse B. Ruesink T. Spelsberg T.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4535-4542Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 26Rejman J. Landers J.P. Goldberger A. McCormick D. Gosse B. Spelsberg T.C. J.

Briefly, purified RBF was solubilized in 6 m guanidine-HCl in reconstitution buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm PMSF) to a concentration of 250 ng/ml. This concentration of the RBF was found to be important for optimal protein renaturation and reconstitution of PR-binding sites on the DNA (26Rejman J. Landers J.P. Goldberger A. McCormick D. Gosse B. Spelsberg T.C. J. Protein Chem. 1991; 10: 651-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 30Spelsberg T.C. Goldberger A. Horton M. Hora J. J.

Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5103-5113Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was also found in these current studies to be important for achieving the optimal DNA sequence-specific binding. The solution was loaded into 10-mm diameter dialysis tubing and dialyzed in a plastic cylinder filled with 200 ml of 6.0 mguanidine-HCl against 1 liter of reconstitution buffer at a replacement rate of 1 ml/min to a guanidine concentration of 0 molarity, while rocking at 4 °C. After 16 h, the protein solution was removed from the dialysis bags, homogenized, and used in the Southwestern blotting analysis. Synthetic DNA corresponding to regions of the 5′-c-myc gene were synthesized using PCR. However, the 1021-bp E fragment (see Fig. 1) was obtained by restriction digests of the c-myc plasmid with SmaI. The nuclear matrix DNA was isolated, with modifications, as described in Schuchard et al. (23Schuchard M. Subramaniam M. Ruesink T. Spelsberg T.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9516-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei, isolated from hen oviduct, were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, pH 7.5) and then centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended again in a buffer A and recentrifuged. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 2 m NaCl, pH 7.5) and centrifuged. After a second resuspension and centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in TM buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.25 m sucrose, pH 7.5). This solution was subjected to extensive DNase I and RNase digestion. SDS and proteinase K were then added to 0.5% (w/v) and 50 mg/ml, respectively. The fractions were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated. Matrix DNA was then gel-purified and fragments of 100–200 base pairs, representing the bulk of the residual/protected DNA, were excised. The DNA was dephosphorylated and the 5′-end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The avian c-mycgenomic clone was used as a template in standard PCR reactions. Primers were designed to yield DNA fragments representing different regions of the 5′-upstream flanking domain of the c-myc gene. DNA was gel-purified and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by standard T4 kinase reactions. For the Southwestern blot analyses, the purified, reconstituted RBF (31 or 62 ng/slot) was diluted in reconstitution buffer and then slot blotted onto nitrocellulose under vacuum, using a slot blot apparatus. The RBF-MBP fusion protein was also slotted in some cases. The membrane was incubated with end-labeled DNA probes representative of nuclear matrix DNA or c-mycfragments of the upstream regions of the c-myc gene. Colipase C (50 ng; Sigma), a 10-kDa protein with a pI of 7.0, was also slot blotted and used as a negative control. In some cases, histones (histone type II-AS calf thymus; Sigma H7755) were blotted and used as a nonspecific DNA-binding protein. The nitrocellulose was cut into strips to be incubated with different probes. Blots were blocked for 1.5 h in standard Bowens buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrollidine), then probed with 3–5 × 106cpm end-labeled DNA probes, including 50 mm KCl and 1 mm CaCl2 (23Schuchard M. Subramaniam M. Ruesink T. Spelsberg T.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9516-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The blots were washed with Bowens binding buffer and exposed to autoradiographic film. Southern blot analysis using DNA/nuclear matrix was conducted according to the procedure described previously with some modifications (23Schuchard M. Subramaniam M. Ruesink T. Spelsberg T.C. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9516-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts (10 pmol for 1021 and matrix; 20 pmol for I1, I2, H, J, K, I6, I8, and I10, corresponding to upstream regions of the avian c-myc gene, as described previously above), were diluted in SSC buffer (0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0) were heat- and alkali-denatured and slot blotted onto nitrocellulose. Blots were baked, prehybridized in Denhardt's medium, then hybridized with the end-labeled nuclear matrix DNA, and washed and exposed to x-ray film. The coding region of the RBF gene was cloned, in frame, into the pMAL-c2 vector and expressed as MBP as specified by the brochure “Protein Fusion and Purification System” accompanying the kit provided by New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA. After the sequence of the construct was verified, the vector was used to transform competent Escherichia coliwhereby large scale amounts of the fusion protein were produced and purified by affinity chromatography as described in the kit brochure. The fusion protein migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis as a 55-kDa protein. A new polyclonal antibody (pAb) was then prepared against the RBF-MBP fusion protein. Briefly, 1 mg od purified lyophilized protein was sent to Cocalico Biologicals, Inc. (Reamstown, PA), where two rabbits were inoculated and serums recovered. The pAb was then purified from the serum using the Affi-Gel Protein A MAPS II kit according to a brochure provided by Bio-Rad. Western blots showed that this polyclonal antibody (pAb 273) reacted against the RBF-MBP, as well as the purified reconstituted and factor Xa-cleaved RBF proteins. Electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays (EMSA) were conducted, with modification to the original procedure, reported by Fried and Crothers (49Fried M. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar, 50Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 241-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 51Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 172: 263-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, 200–500 ng of RBF-MBP in binding buffer (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol) was incubated with 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA probes were synthesized and labeled as above (500,000 cpm each) and added to the protein solution, which was incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The mixture was rocked with the RBF-MBP polyclonal antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by gel electrophoresis on 6% (w/v) native acrylamide gels (75:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at 26 V/cm in 0.5 × TBE buffer (0.05 m Tris borate, 0.001 mEDTA, pH 8.0) for 2.5 h at 4 °C. Gels were then dried and exposed to autoradiographic film. The N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of the RBF protein was determined by the Mayo Protein Core Facility (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Briefly, purified RBF protein (500 pmol) or its tryptic peptides were applied to a Polybrene-treated glass filter disk, and then microsequenced by the Edman degradation method on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 476A Protein Sequencer using programmed cycles provided by ABI (Foster City, CA). The phenylthiohydantoin amino acids from each cycle were identified on-line by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on an ABI 120A PTH Analyzer. The cDNA for RBF was obtained using polymerase chain reaction procedures, as described previously (28Landers J.P. Subramaniam M. Gosse B. Weinshilboum R. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell Biochem. 1994; 55: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Briefly, poly (A)+ mRNA from chicken oviduct was reverse transcribed using an oligo(dT) primer to obtain the first strand cDNA. The cDNA was used as a template in the PCR along with sense primer (oligonucleotides synthesized from the N-terminal sequence of RBF) and antisense primer (dT). One of the PCR primers also contained a T7 or SP6 phage promoter. The PCR-amplified DNA was transcribed and sequenced using RNA amplification with transcript sequencing (RAWTS) method described previously by Sarkar and Sommer (52Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 5197Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cDNA sequence correlated with the amino acid sequence. Preliminary analysis of the primary and secondary structure of the RBF protein was performed by computer analysis using peptide structure and helical wheel algorithms contained in the sequence analysis software package, produced by the Genetics Computer Group (GCG) of the University of Wisconsin, Biotechnology Center, Madison, WI. An RBF open reading frame was cloned into an expression vector (pSG5; Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which is regulated by SV40 enhancer element. In all experiments, the pSG5 expression vector itself was transfected as a control to determine the effects of the transfected plasmid alone. The reporter construct consisted of the c-myc gene E fragment (1021 bp) (see Fig. 1), cloned into the pGL2 basic (Promega) luciferase vector. The RBF construct was cotransfected along with the 1021 pGL2 reporter construct. A tk-CAT reporter construct was included in all transfections to access and normalize for variations in the transfection efficiency. The MCF-7 cells were cultured using Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 1 × antibiotic/antimycotic solution (100 μg of penicillin, 0.1 μg of streptomycin, and 0.25 μg of amphotericin B/ml (Sigma)), 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Sigma), and 10−8m17β-estradiol (E2) (Sigma). The E2 was included to maintain optimal cell proliferation and high PR levels. For the transfections, the MCF-7 cells were trypsinized, plated into 100-mm dishes, and grown for ∼48 h to approximately 50% confluence in the above described (DMEM) medium containing charcoal-stripped serum containing 10−8m E2. The charcoal stripping of the serum was performed to remove endogenous steroids. The cells were then co-transfected with the 1021 pGL2 reporter gene construct and either the pSG5-RBF expression construct or the pSG5 vector alone, using the LipofectAMINE reagent according to the procedure provided by Life Technologies, Inc. The assays contained experimentally optimized quantities of DNA (represented per plate as: 10 μg of pSG5 and/or RBF expression vectors along with 2 μg of the 1021 pGL2 reporter gene construct and 2.4 μg of tk-CAT). The various DNAs and LipofectAMINE were added individually to serum-free, antibiotic-free media, then mixed together and placed on"

Analysis of transformation-defective cell clones generated after mutagenesis of the ras-retroviral vector used to transduce the ras gene showed an inverse correlation between p18 expression and the degree of transformation. p18 expression was high in non-transformed clones, intermediate in a partially transformed clone, undetectable in fully transformed clones, and detectable only at the non-permissive temperature in a clone which was cold-sensitive for ras transformation. In non-transformed cells, p18 expression varied with the degree of confluence. It was almost undetectable in medium from sparse, proliferating cells, but increased as the cells approached confluence and peaked 2–4 days after confluence. Microsequencing of partially purified p18 identified it as the developmentally regulated neurotrophic factor pleiotrophin. In further experiments, pleiotrophin was undetectable or almost undetectable in medium from fully transformed cells expressing the oncogenes v-src, truncated c-raf, activated c-fms, or polyomavirus middle tumor antigen; it was low but easily detectable in medium from SV40 large tumor antigen-expressing cells, which form soft agar colonies but not foci. Thus, pleiotrophin expression in NIH 3T3 cells is associated with quiescence, and suppression of pleiotrophin is related to oncogenic transformation.

The process which causes a proliferating cell to stop dividing is arguably the most important prerequisite for the orderly development of multicellular organisms. During embryogenesis, precursor cells which will form each tissue or organ proliferate and migrate to their predetermined position. They then cease to divide and commence to differentiate into their mature functional form. They also await or actively promote the arrival of other tissues, including blood vessels and nerve fibers, by secreting additional factors. Similar events occur during wound repair as the appropriate cell types proliferate only until they reach the boundaries of the original tissue. In tissue culture, cells which display good growth control and contact-inhibition divide only until they form a confluent monolayer. One question which remains unanswered is whether the signal to cease dividing is merely a mechanical event caused by the physical interaction of crowded cells, or whether the cells release negative growth factors which function in an autocrine or paracrine fashion to suppress cell division in themselves and in neighboring cells. Conversely, the central question in cancer biology is why tumor cells are unresponsive to the signals which cause normal cells to stop dividing. This work addresses these questions by examining a factor thought to be involved in both development and tumor formation which appears to be a marker for normal contact-inhibition and quiescence.

This report describes a new isolation of pleiotrophin based on quite different characteristics. The work began as an investigation of the characteristics of cells transformed by the oncogene ras(for review, see Refs. 21Bollag G. McCormick F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 601-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 22Haubruck H. McCormick F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 215-229PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). The ras genes encode a family of 21-kDa membrane-associated GTPases. A single point mutation at any of several critical positions inhibits the GTPase function and activates the transforming potential of p21ras (24Grand R.J. Owen D. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 165-187Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 25Der C.J. Finkel T. Cooper G.M. Cell. 1986; 44: 167-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar).

In this report, pleiotrophin is identified as a confluence-specific protein secreted by normal cells which is not produced when the cells are transformed by ras or other oncogenes. NIH 3T3 cells or derivatives thereof were used in all experiments. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) 1The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; pyMT, polyomavirus middle tumor antigen; svLT, simian virus 40 large tumor antigen; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% donor calf serum and maintained in a 10% CO2 incubator. ras cells expressed a transforming c-Ha-ras cDNA activated by substitution of leucine at codon 61 (28Corbley M.J. Cherington V. Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Roberts T.M. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 1102-1109PubMed Google Scholar). The ras gene was expressed from an integrated retroviral vector which also carries a G418 resistance marker (29Korman A.J. Frantz J.D. Strominger J.L. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2150-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Ras N.6P cells were obtained by pooling more than 50 G418-resistant infected colonies; Ras N.62 cells were from a single colony (28Corbley M.J. Cherington V. Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Roberts T.M. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 1102-1109PubMed Google Scholar). Pleiotrophin was observed in both NIH 3T3 cells and in NIH 3T3 cells infected with the control pDOL retrovirus (29Korman A.J. Frantz J.D. Strominger J.L. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2150-2154Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) which carried no insert. To obtain the transformation-defective RM (rasmutant) cell lines in Fig. 1, the retroviral plasmid pRPD (28Corbley M.J. Cherington V. Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Roberts T.M. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 1102-1109PubMed Google Scholar) containing the ras Leu-61 insert was mutagenized with hydroxylamine or shortwave ultraviolet light prior to transfection into packaging cells. Viral supernatants were used to infect target cells and G418-resistant cell lines which were morphologically non-transformed or unusual were isolated for further study (30Corbley, M. J., Studies on the Mechanism of Cell Transformation by the Human ras Oncogene, 1988, Harvard University, doctoral dissertation, Ann Arbor, University Microfilms, Inc.Google Scholar). v-src transformed cells were made by infection with a recombinant retrovirus produced by the Ψ2 V5 cell line (31Piwnica-Worms H. Kaplan D.R. Whitman M. Roberts T.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), selection with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and pooling of resistant colonies. Cells transformed by a c-raf-1 gene activated by deletion of codons 3–333 were generated in similar fashion with a retrovirus produced by the Ψ2 LN42K cell line (32Wood K.W. Qi H. D'Arcangelo G. Armstrong R.C. Roberts T.M. Halegoua S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5016-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Cells transformed by the middle tumor antigen of polyomavirus (pyMT) were made with a retrovirus from the Ψ2 MT12 cell line (33Cherington V. Morgan B. Spiegelman B.M. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4307-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Cells transformed by c-fms expressed from an SV40-based expression plasmid (34Taylor G.R. Reedijk M. Rothwell V. Rohrschneider L. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2029-2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were obtained from Gareth R. Taylor, Mount Sinai Hospital Research Institute, Toronto. Cells transformed by the large tumor antigen of simian virus 40 (svLT) expressed from an integrated retroviral vector (35Brown M. McCormack M. Zinn K.G. Farrell M.P. Bikel I. Livingston D.M. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 290-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained from Myles Brown, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA. 2 × 104 cells were seeded into 2 ml of top agar (DMEM, 10% donor calf serum, 0.3% Difco bacto-agar) and layered onto 5 ml of pre-solidified 0.6% bottom agar in 60-mm dishes. Non-transformed cells were allowed to proliferate until they formed a flat, confluent monolayer and then were left for 2–3 days at confluence prior to labeling or analysis. Transformed cells were grown until very dense, such that the number of cells per plate was at least 4-fold higher than the number of non-transformed cells on a confluent plate. As noted in the figure legends, cells in 35-mm dishes were washed 3 times with methionine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and then were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (New England Nuclear) in 600–700 μl of methionine-free DMEM at 250 μCi/ml with or without 10% calf serum for 4 h or 8 h. After labeling, the conditioned medium was removed and the cells were washed twice with 2.5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2. The cells were then lysed in 500 μl of RIPA-1 buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.25, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.30 units/ml aprotinin, and 0.1 mm leupeptin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and frozen. 10 μl of each sample were always frozen separately for trichloroacetic acid precipitation analysis. The samples were normalized for equal amounts of 35S label incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material. Typically, 4–8 × 106 cpm of each lysate were used for further analysis. Conditioned labeling medium was removed after the labeling period and cleared by centrifugation. For immunoprecipitations, each sample was mixed with 600 μl of lysis buffer, frozen on dry ice, and stored at −80 °C. From then on, the samples were treated in the same manner as the cell lysates. For other analyses, the samples were frozen immediately without lysis buffer. 10-μl aliquots were frozen separately for trichloroacetic acid analysis. Samples of conditioned medium were normalized among themselves for equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts. Typically, 1–7 × 106 cpm were used. Immunoprecipitations of p21raswere carried out essentially as described (36Finkel T. Der C.J. Cooper G.M. Cell. 1984; 37: 151-158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) with rat anti-p21 monoclonal antibody YA6–172 (37Furth M.E. Davis L.J. Fleurdelys B. Scolnick E.M. J. Virol. 1982; 43: 294-304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or normal rat serum, and a secondary affinity-purified goat anti-rat IgG antibody (Cappel) pre-coated onto Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Sigma). The samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on 13 or 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Poly(A)-Sepharose 4B beads (Pharmacia 17-0860-01) were swelled in water, equilibrated overnight at 4 °C in RIPA-2 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium fluoride, and 0.02% sodium azide), rinsed three times with RIPA-2 and brought up to a final 33% slurry in RIPA-2. Poly(A)-Sepharose 4B from Sigma had significantly less capacity for binding p18. In a typical experiment, samples of labeled conditioned medium containing equal trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were brought to 500 μl with DMEM. An aliquot of the poly(A)-Sepharose 4B bead slurry was added and the total volume was brought to 1 ml with additional RIPA-2. (For quantitative experiments, the volume of beads necessary to completely precipitate p18 was determined in preliminary experiments. Generally, a bed volume of 33–120 μl was used.) The incubation also included 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.1 TIU/ml aprotinin. The samples were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h on a rocker and then spun briefly at low speed in a microcentrifuge. After removal of the supernatant, the beads were washed three times with RIPA-2 and once with Protein buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25, 0.005 mm EDTA). GSD electrophoresis loading buffer (6.6% SDS, 33% glycerol, 0.051 g/ml dithiothreitol) was added (1 volume to 2 bead bed volumes). The samples were boiled for 3 min, spun through Spin-X 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filters (Costar) for maximum recovery and separated on a 15% gel. Cells were washed 3 times with DMEM and then incubated in fresh DMEM for 8 h. Conditioned media were collected, cleared by centrifugation, and frozen. Samples of medium were assayed for total protein by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay and normalized to each other. SDS-PAGE was carried out on 15% gels. Transfer onto an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore) and analytical Western blots for pleiotrophin were performed according to standard protocols. Blots were probed with anti-pleiotrophin antiserum (R & D Systems AF-252-PB) as the primary antibody and mouse anti-goat IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce) as the secondary antibody. Detection was by Enhanced Chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham). NIH 3T3 cells were plated into 33 150-mm dishes and allowed to come to confluence over 3 days. At confluence, each plate of cells was fed with DMEM plus 10% calf serum, incubated overnight, rinsed 3 times with 5 ml of DMEM, and incubated in 10 ml of DMEM (without serum) for 8 h. The conditioned medium from all plates was pooled, cleared by centrifugation, frozen in dry ice/ethanol, and stored at −80 °C. An aliquot of the medium was assayed to determine the binding capacity of the poly(A)-Sepharose 4B beads for the p18 in this preparation. The bulk precipitation mixture consisted of 330 ml of conditioned medium, 350 ml of RIPA-2 buffer, 660 μl of 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 330 μl of 10 units/ml aprotinin, and 24 ml of a 50% suspension of poly(A)-Sepharose 4B beads (12-ml bed volume, approximately 3.2 g dry weight), distributed among three 200-ml disposable centrifuge bottles (Falcon). These were rocked at 4 °C for 6 h. They were then spun at 3000 rpm in a bench-top Beckman centrifuge at 4 °C for 15 min, the beads were allowed to settle for 10 min and most of the supernatant was removed. The beads were pooled, washed with RIPA-2, transferred to six 15-ml Falcon tubes, and washed twice more with RIPA-2. Each tube, now containing about 3 ml of bead suspension, was washed once with 3 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.25, 8 m urea, 16% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm EDTA, and once with 15 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.25, 400 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA. These two washes had previously been shown to strip other proteins from the beads without removing any p18. The beads were then washed twice with Protein buffer, pooled in two 15-ml tubes and washed once more with Protein buffer. The supernatant was aspirated off to the top of the beads. Approximately 11.5 ml of total bed volume of beads was recovered. 1.5 ml of GSD was added to each tube and the samples were boiled for 7 min. The samples were pooled, transferred to one Costar 50-ml Spin-X filter tube, and centrifuged to separate the liquid from the beads. Approximately 6.25 ml of liquid sample were recovered. The SDS-PAGE conditions were adapted from a method of Schägger and von Jagow (38Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10408) Google Scholar) to improve stacking of low molecular weight proteins. A 15% resolving gel (National Diagnostics, 30%:0.8% acrylamide:bis) and a long 4% stacking gel were employed. An additional problem encountered with slab gels was that the small proteins typically spread across the slab into wide bands. Consequently, to physically limit diffusion, the gel was cast in a 10-ml disposable polystyrene pipette (Falcon) from which the tip had been broken off. The resolving gel extended from the 9.2-ml mark up to the 5.5-ml mark. The stacking gel extended to the 1.5-ml mark. 5.8 ml of the recovered sample was loaded above the stack. The pipette was supported in a Bio-Rad Protean II xi electrophoresis chamber with the top raised to allow for the extra height of the pipette. Electrophoresis was at 20 mA for 16 h. The pipette was then cracked with pliers, and the tubular resolving gel was removed. The gel was laid on a sheet of polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and set up in a standard slab gel Western sandwich, allowing the proteins to migrate laterally out of the tube. Electrotransfer was overnight at 0.25 A in 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, 2% methanol, 0.1% SDS. After transfer, the membrane was stained with 0.1% Amido Black 10B. The correct band was identified by comparison to prestained protein standards run in parallel tubes and was excised for microsequencing. The preparative sample of p18 on the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was digested with trypsinin situ. The peptides were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and individual peptides were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems model 477A Protein Sequencer with a model 120A on-line phenylthiohydantoin-amino acid analyzer. Analysis was carried out by William S. Lane, John Nevey, Renee Robinson, and co-workers at the Harvard Microchemistry Lab, Cambridge, MA. Initial experiments identified a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 18 kDa (p18), which appeared during immunoprecipitation of p21ras as a prominent band in non-transformed control cells but not in ras-transformed cells. NIH 3T3 cells expressing an activated rasp21Leu-61 were generated by infection with a recombinant retroviral vector and were fully transformed (28Corbley M.J. Cherington V. Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Roberts T.M. Biotechniques. 1994; 17: 1102-1109PubMed Google Scholar). Control DOL retrovirus-infected NIH 3T3 cells were morphologically normal and formed a contact-arrested monolayer. As shown in Fig.1 A, theras-transformed cells displayed an easily distinguishableras p21Leu-61 band (lane 6), which ran with a faster mobility than the endogenous p21c-Ha-ras (39Yuasa Y. Srivastava S.K. Dunn C.Y. Rhim J.S. Reddy E.P. Aaronson S.A. Nature. 1983; 303: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and which was absent in DOL cells (lane 1). In the immunoprecipitates from contact-arrested DOL cells, however, there was a prominent band at 18 kDa (lane 1), which was entirely absent from immunoprecipitates from the ras cells (lane 6). When normal rat serum was substituted for anti-p21 antibody, the 18-kDa protein was brought down in the same manner from DOL but not fromras cells (data not shown). This indicated that p18 was not an alternative form of p21ras, was not bound to p21, and was not an antigenically related protein. Later experiments, in which the primary and secondary antibodies were omitted, showed that p18 was binding primarily to the Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads used to pull down the antibodies (data not shown). Further investigation also proved that p18 was not related to the retroviral vector, since the pattern of p18 expression was identical in uninfected NIH 3T3 cells and in DOL-infected cells (Fig. 2). This intriguing apparent correlation between ras transformation and the disappearance of p18 called for further study. A mutagenesis strategy, which was designed to generate transformation-defective mutants of the ras Leu-61 gene by mutagenizing the ras retroviral plasmid (30Corbley, M. J., Studies on the Mechanism of Cell Transformation by the Human ras Oncogene, 1988, Harvard University, doctoral dissertation, Ann Arbor, University Microfilms, Inc.Google Scholar), produced a variety of infected cell clones covering a range of phenotypes, including fully transformed, partially transformed, non-transformed, and cold-sensitive for transformation. These clones were examined to define the relationship between p18 expression and ras transformation. The results are summarized in Table I. As shown in the immunoprecipitations in Fig. 1 A, cells which produced no stable ras p21Leu-61 from the mutagenized integrated retrovirus, and which were morphologically normal (lanes 3 and4), had a p18 band identical to that in control DOL cells (lane 1), whereas cells which were transformed and which were still synthesizing p21Leu-61, did not have a p18 band (lanes 2and5). Cell clone RM.37 was cold-sensitive for transformation: the cells were morphologically transformed, overgrew the monolayer, and formed colonies in soft agar at 37 or 39 °C, but were morphologically normal, contact-inhibited, and incapable of growth in soft agar at 32 °C (data not shown). Fig. 1 Bdemonstrates that at 37 °C these cells made a significant amount ofras p21Leu-61 but very little p18; in contrast, at 32 °C the level of stable p21Leu-61 was low but the amount of p18 was significantly increased (lanes 8). In cells which were morphologically normal at both temperatures, the level of p18 was high at both temperatures (lanes 7). In cells which were transformed at both temperatures, the level ofras p21Leu-61 was the same at both temperatures and there was no sudden appearance of p18 at 32 °C (lanes 9). Finally, as shown in Fig. 1 C, there appeared to be a relationship between the level of p18 production and contact- or density-inhibition of growth. The cell clone RM.44 (lanes 12) produced p21Leu-61 at a level equivalent to that of the fully-transformed cells (lane 11). However, the phenotype of RM.44 was “partially transformed.” The cells grew to a high density but were incapable of piling on top of one another in typical ras-transformed fashion. They also formed somewhat smaller colonies in soft agar (data not shown). The p18 level in RM.44 cells was likewise intermediate between the level in fully transformed cells (lane 11) and the level in two cell clones which formed normal growth-arrested monolayers (lanes 10 and13). Thus, among all the cell clones tested, there was a strict inverse correlation between p18 expression and the degree of transformation, as summarized in Table I.Table IRelationship between p18/pleiotrophin (PTN) expression and transformation characteristics of ras mutant (RM) and oncogene-transformed cell clonesCell clonePhenotype1-aPhenotype: F = flat, morphologically normal; Tx = transformed; PT = partially transformed (the cells are rounded and grow to high density but do not overgrow the monolayer).Overgrow1-bOvergrow: the cells overgrow the monolayer and pile up, and/or form foci on a non-transformed monolayer.Soft agar1-cSoft agar: ability of cells to form colonies in 0.3% agar; nt = not tested.p18/PTN1-dp18/PTN: presence or absence as shown in Figs. 1 and 6; +/− = intermediate level of p18.DOLF−−+Ras N.62Tx++−RM.27F−nt+RM.28F−nt+RM.35F−−+RM.40F−−+RM.45F−nt+RM.26Tx+nt−RM.33Tx+nt−RM.34Tx++−RM.42Tx++−RM.37/32°F−−+RM.37/37°Tx++−RM.44PT−++/−rafTx++−srcTx++−fmsTx++−pyMTTx++−svLTPT−++/−1-a Phenotype: F = flat, morphologically normal; Tx = transformed; PT = partially transformed (the cells are rounded and grow to high density but do not overgrow the monolayer).1-b Overgrow: the cells overgrow the monolayer and pile up, and/or form foci on a non-transformed monolayer.1-c Soft agar: ability of cells to form colonies in 0.3% agar; nt = not tested.1-d p18/PTN: presence or absence as shown in Figs. 1 and 6; +/− = intermediate level of p18. Open table in a new tab To determine whether p18 might simply be degraded more rapidly in ras cells than in non-transformed cells, the cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h, and the label was then chased in the presence of cycloheximide to inhibit any further protein synthesis. In lysates from ras cells, p18 was not detectable at any time point (data not shown), indicating that p18 was not being produced at all. In lysates from DOL cells, p18 was detectable after the 1-h label, but the labeled band disappeared after a 1-h chase (data not shown). Further investigation revealed that this rapid disappearance of p18 from the DOL lysates was due to secretion of the protein into the medium, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

Here we examined whether there is an abnormality in TKP in cultured fibroblasts from 11 patients with hyperapobetalipoproteinemia (hyperapoB) that manifest two acylation-stimulatory defects, decreased stimulation of triglyceride synthesis by BP I but enhanced formation of cholesterol by BP II. Soluble and insoluble proteins in Triton X-100 extracts were isolated by immunoprecipitation with a monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (MAPA) bound to agarose beads and by ultracentrifugation, respectively, from confluent fibroblasts after incubation for 24 h in supplemented serum-free and lipid-free medium (DMEM/F12). Western blots of insoluble proteins showed that group (Gp) II (M r 36,000–55,000) and Gp III (M r 14,000–35,000) from hyperapoB cells, grown in DMEM/F12 medium without BP, had significantly decreased reactivity to MAPA. No significant differences in reactivity to MAPA were detected between normal and hyperapoB cells for Gp I (M r97–120,000). BP II, but not BP I or BP III, reversed the decreased reactivity of Gp II and Gp III to MAPA in hyperapoB cells. Sodium vanadate, an inhibitor of phosphotyrosine phosphatases, did not reverse the deficiency in TKP or the 50% deficiency in the stimulation of mass triglyceride by BP I in hyperapoB cells. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Erk-2, a mitogen-activated protein kinase, identified as one of the proteins in Gp II, was significantly decreased in hyperapoB cells. These results provide further evidence for abnormal protein TKP in hyperapoB cells and suggest a possible link between atherosclerotic changes in hyperapoB patients and growth factors upstream from mitogen-activated protein kinase.

HyperapoB is characterized by an increased number of small, dense low density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, a phenotype shared with familial combined hyperlipidemia, LDL subclass pattern B, familial dyslipidemic hypertension, and syndrome X (2Coresh J.

Lipidol. 1993; 4: 133-143Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two metabolic defects have been described in hyperapoB. First, there is overproduction of apolipoprotein B and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particles (3Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Curr. Opin.

Second, the clearance of postprandial triglyceride-rich particles is delayed, accompanied by an abnormal removal of free fatty acids (5Genest J. Sniderman A.D. Cianflone K. Teng B. Wacloher S.

We isolated three basic proteins (BP) from normal human serum that we called BP I, BP II, and BP III, based on their electrophoretic migration (8Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8980-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Their M r and isoelectric points, respectively, were as follows: BP I, 14,000 and 9.10; BP II, 27,500 and 8.48; BP III, 55,000 and 8.73 (8Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8980-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The amino acid compositions of each were distinct from each other (8Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8980-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). BP I appears to be a different protein from acylation-stimulatory protein, a basic protein that has similar metabolic effects; acylation-stimulatory protein has been reported to be the same protein as C3ades-Arg (M r 8,000), a proteolytic cleavage product of C3, the third component of complement (15Baldo A.

In normal cultured fibroblasts, the major effect of BP I is a marked (2–3-fold) stimulation of the mass of triglyceride (8Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8980-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Bachorik P.S. Kafonek S.D. Chatterjee S. Beaty T.H. Virgil D. Clin.

BP II and BP III have considerably less of an effect than BP I on triglyceride formation in normal cells.The effects of BP I, BP II, and BP III on triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism in hyperapoB fibroblasts are clearly different from each other (8Kwiterovich Jr., P.O.

First, there is a 50% deficiency in the stimulation of triglyceride production by BP I in hyperapoB fibroblasts. No abnormality in triglyceride metabolism was seen with BP II or BP III in hyperapoB cells (8Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8980-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Bachorik P.S. Kafonek S.D. Chatterjee S. Beaty T.H. Virgil D. Clin.

Second, BP II (but not BP I or BP III) abnormally stimulated (about 6-fold) the production of cholesterol and cholesteryl esters in hyperapoB fibroblasts. If such an effect of BP II occurs in the liver of hyperapoB patients, this may further accentuate hepatic apolipoprotein B and VLDL overproduction, leading to overproduction of LDL and increased atherosclerosis (3Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 133-143Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). There was no abnormality in triglyceride or cholesterol metabolism in hyperapoB fibroblasts with BP III.In cultured normal human monocyte-derived macrophages, BP III, but not BP I or BP II, significantly stimulated the formation of cell cholesteryl esters (9Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Bachorik P.S. Kafonek S.D. Chatterjee S. Beaty T.H. Virgil D. Clin. Chem. 1991; 37: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that the effects of the serum basic proteins may be tissue-specific and provides further evidence for structural and functional differences between BP I, BP II, and BP III.In normal cultured fibroblasts, the effects of BP I and BP II are time- and concentration-dependent (8Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8980-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Bachorik P.S. Kafonek S.D.

Circulation. 1995; 92 (abstr.): I-426Google Scholar), suggesting that a high affinity cell surface mechanism is involved. In hyperapoB cells, the defect in the response to the stimulation of triglyceride formation by BP I is also time- and concentration-dependent and appears related to a deficiency in a high affinity cell surface mechanism (19Bachorik, P. S., Virgil, D., Motevalli, M., and Kwiterovich, P. O. (1996) Circulation , 94, Suppl. I, 347Google Scholar). Conversely, the abnormality in the overresponse of hyperapoB cells to BP II by enhanced cholesterol formation is concentration-dependent and saturable (7Teng B. Forse A. Rodriquez M.A. Sniderman A.D.

S., Virgil, D., Motevalli, M., and Kwiterovich, P. O. (1996) Circulation , 94, Suppl. I, 347Google Scholar).These effects of BP I and BP II were blocked by genistein, a specific inhibitor of protein-tyrosine kinase phosphorylation (TKP) (20Levitski A. Gizit A. Science. 1995; 267: 1782-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar, 21Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The stimulatory effect of BP I on the production of triglyceride was inhibited by 50% by genistein in normal cells, to a level seen in hyperapoB cells (11Kwiterovich P.O. Motevalli M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In contrast, no inhibition of this effect of BP I was seen with genistein in hyperapoB cells, suggesting that the defect in the response of hyperapoB cells to the acylation-stimulatory activity of BP I may involve TKP. The abnormal stimulation by BP II of cholesterol mass and production in hyperapoB cells was also inhibited by genistein (12Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Coresh J. Circulation. 1995; 92 (abstr.): I-426Google Scholar). These observed biochemical effects of genistein may be due to a generalized effect on TKP, which might include transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors, membrane-associated tyrosine kinase molecules, or protein kinases at the postreceptor level (22Bolen J.B. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2025-2031PubMed Google Scholar, 23Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1992; 252: 668-674Crossref Scopus (1429) Google Scholar, 24Abler A. Smith J.A.

Since tyrosine kinases are involved in the control of cell growth, an abnormality in the tyrosine kinase-mediated second messenger pathways may contribute to increased cell proliferation in the arterial wall and premature atherosclerosis in patients with hyperapoB.Here we have taken a more direct immunologic approach to study the possibility that there is an abnormality in TKP in hyperapoB cells and the effect of BP I, BP II, and BP III on TKP. We also examined the immunoreactivity of tyrosine-phosphorylated extracellular signal regulatory kinase-2 (Erk-2), a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), known to be activated as a result of the effect of growth factors on cell surface transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptors (25Fantl W.J.

While the immunological reagents employed here are highly specific for phosphorylated tyrosines, the cellular proteins under study are derived from fibroblasts that have undergone a series of experimental manipulations followed by Western blotting and quantitation by densitometry. This complex process leads to intraindividual variability. Despite this variability, we were able to demonstrate a range of tyrosine phosphorylation in normal cells from multiple experiments over 2 years, and show that tyrosine phosphorylation in Gp II and Gp III proteins was deficient in hyperapoB fibroblasts. Given such variability, we are not proposing here that this assay be added as a genetic marker. However, these immunologic data confirm and extend our previous biochemical studies that support the tenet that TKP might be involved in the pathophysiology of hyperapoB.Cell culture conditions were selected that minimized the effect of growth factors and cytokines on cell TKP. The cells were first grown in fetal calf serum, which contains a full panoply of growth factors that may activate TKP. Under these conditions, the fibroblasts replicate until they reach confluence. At this point, the cells were switched to a serum-free, lipid-free medium (i.e. DMEM/F12) for 24 h, since a study of the effect of the BP in the presence of other serum proteins makes it difficult to separate out the unique effects of the BP on the cell. Such cell culture conditions had previously been shown to provide optimal activity of the BP (8Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8980-8984Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Bachorik P.S. Kafonek S.D. Chatterjee S. Beaty T.H. Virgil D. Clin.

Thromb. 1994; 14: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 11Kwiterovich P.O. Motevalli M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 12Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Coresh J. Circulation. 1995; 92 (abstr.): I-426Google Scholar).The abnormal pattern of reactivity of the phosphotyrosine proteins in hyperapoB cells to a monoclonal antibody was present in the basal condition. Further, the addition of BP II reversed the abnormally low immunochemical reactivity of the phosphorylated tyrosines in both Gp II and Gp III proteins in hyperapoB cells. In contrast, the addition of BP I and BP III did not change the pattern of phosphorylated tyrosines in normal cells nor reverse the abnormality in the hyperapoB cells. It is possible that BP I may be influencing a phosphorylated tyrosine protein that is present in too low a quantity to visualize by Western blots. Alternatively, the BP I could primarily have its cellular effect through another pathway that requires intact TKP to be fully functional.Preliminary experiments in our laboratory indicate a deficiency of high affinity binding of biotinylated BP I to hyperapoB cells, while biotinylated BP II has a greater affinity for hyperapoB than for normal cells (19Bachorik, P. S., Virgil, D., Motevalli, M., and Kwiterovich, P. O. (1996) Circulation , 94, Suppl. I, 347Google Scholar). It is not known if BP I and BP II are bound to different sites on the same receptor or whether they are bound to distinct receptors. It appears that BP II stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Gp II and Gp III proteins, suggesting that it may bind to transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor.Our studies also provide evidence for a significant relationship between the degree of tyrosine phosphorylation in Gp III proteins and the level of LDL apoB in plasma. We previously showed that LDL apoB levels in the six unrelated hyperapoB probands and the six normals were significantly related to the acylation-stimulatory activity in cultured fibroblasts for BP I on triglyceride production and for BP II on cholesterol production (9Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Bachorik P.S. Kafonek S.D. Chatterjee S. Beaty T.H. Virgil D. Clin. Chem. 1991; 37: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Taken together, such information suggests, but does not prove, that the cellular deficiency in hyperapoB cells in TKP and in the response to BP I (understimulation of triglyceride production) and to BP II (overstimulation of cholesterol production) are involved in mediating the increased plasma levels of LDL apoB seen in hyperapoB patients (BP II activity would have to be in the liver).One possibility is that there is a defect in a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor for the BP in hyperapoB. Under the conditions of cell culture used here, this defect may be associated with decreased activity (phosphorylation) of the molecules in the MAPK pathway. As well, there may be decreased phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ, which may lead to decreased production of diacylglycerol and IP3, and decreased protein kinase C activity. Inhibiting protein kinase C activity prevents the effects of BP I and BP II from being manifested in both normal and hyperapoB cells (10Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar); however, the stimulation of protein kinase C by an analogue of diacylglycerol appears normal in the hyperapoB cells (10Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Miller M. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1994; 14: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar).The experiment with sodium vanadate suggested that the inhibition of phosphotyrosine phosphatases in the normal cells promoted the production of triglyceride, an observation that might be expected if TKP promotes triglyceride formation. For example, inhibition of protein-tyrosine phosphatase by sodium vanadate has been shown to enhance the autophosphorylation of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor following treatment of Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells (34Tomaska L. Resnick R.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In hyperapoB cells, there was a defect in response to the stimulatory activity of BP I on cell triglyceride mass; however, the addition of sodium vanadate to BP I did not reverse this defect, as one might expect if the defective TKP observed in hyperapoB cells primarily was due to enhanced activity of phosphotyrosine phosphatases.Taken together, these data indicate that there is cellular abnormality in hyperapoB fibroblasts resulting in deficient protein TKP. This tenet is compatible with our previous data, where inhibition of TKP with genistein decreased the stimulation of triglyceride formation with BP I in normal cells to a level indistinguishable from hyperapoB cells (11Kwiterovich P.O. Motevalli M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1195-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We also found that the abnormal stimulation of the formation of cholesterol and cholesteryl ester by BP II in hyperapoB cells was inhibited completely by genistein (12Kwiterovich Jr., P.O. Motevalli M. Coresh J. Circulation. 1995; 92 (abstr.): I-426Google Scholar). The marked stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Gp II and Gp III by BP II in hyperapoB cells is consistent with the biochemical data; furthermore, genistein prevents the reversal of deficient protein TKP in hyperapoB cells by BP II (data not shown). Inhibition of TKP therefore clearly had divergent effects in normal and hyperapoB fibroblasts, suggesting that a significant component of the biochemical effects of BP I and BP II was mediated through pathways involving TKP.The molecular basis of this abnormality in TKP in hyperapoB fibroblasts remains to be determined. The observations here provide a framework within which to examine systematically relationships between cell surface binding of BP I and BP II, intracellular effects on protein phosphorylation and activation of signal transduction molecules, and abnormalities in cell lipid metabolism. It is not known how such an abnormality in protein TKP in hyperapoB cells may be manifestedin vivo. Alterations of proliferation or of apoptosis may accelerate the basic atherosclerotic process in hyperapoB, which is already acerbated by increased numbers of small, dense LDL particles.

In the guinea pig, four abundant proteins called seminal vesicle proteins 1–4 (SVP-1–4) are synthesized from only two transcripts (2Moore J.T. Hagstrom J. McCormick D.J. Harvey S. Madden B.

Although there is clear homology between the 5′-flanking regions and first exons of these genes, their protein coding regions have experienced rapid evolutionary change. Hence, this gene family is sometimes referred to as the REST gene family (rapidly evolving seminal vesicle transcribed) (12Lundwall A. Ulvsback M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although most members of the REST gene family have been reported to be expressed only in the seminal vesicle, transcripts for some of the REST proteins have been identified in other tissues. Semenogelin II is produced in the epididymis (14Lilja H. Abrahamsson P.-A. Lundwall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 1894-1900Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), rat SVS II transcripts are found in the prostate (15Dodd J.G. Kreis C. Sheppard P.C. Hamel A. Matusik R.J. Mol. Cell.

Zool. 1993; 265: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The finding that SVP-1 also has extensive homology to SKALP/elafin led to the discovery that SVP-1-related transcripts were expressed outside the seminal vesicle in tissues such as liver, lung, kidney, and testis (13Hagstrom J.E. Fautsch M.P. Perdok M. Vrabel A. Wieben E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21114-21119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Of particular interest was the finding that the testis produced longer SVP-related mRNAs that were not found in any of these other tissues. Here we report the characterization of three novel SVP cDNAs from guinea pig testis (TSM1–3). Each cDNA maintains the coding and 3′-untranslated region of the seminal vesicle transcript (called GP1) but varies in length and sequence of the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). In vitro translation results demonstrate that the TSMs are functional despite the presence of multiple upstream AUG codons in each of the mRNAs. In each case, multiple antibody-precipitable proteins are synthesized, suggesting that the 5′-UTR extensions found in TSM1, TSM2, and TSM3 may be responsible for translational regulation. A guinea pig testis cDNA library (custom made by Stratagene in Lambda-Zap II) was screened with either a32P-labeled random primed 1400-bp GP1 probe (3Hagstrom J.E. Harvey S. Madden B. McCormick D. Wieben E.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or a 175-bp 5′-end fragment from TSM1. Southern blot analysis of isolated clones revealed 13 positives. Four of the 13 clones represented TSM2 sequence. TSM1 and TSM3 were represented by individual clones. The remaining clones were shorter versions of the other cDNAs. TSM1–3 were sequenced in both directions with either an Applied Biosystems or a Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology A. L. F. DNA sequencer. Total RNA was isolated from guinea pig testis or seminal vesicle (17Cathala G.G. Savouret J. Mendez B. West B.L. Karin M. Martial J.A. Baxter J.D. DNA. 1983; 2: 329-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1229) Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated from total guinea pig testis RNA using mRNA isolation kit III (Promega; No. 5300). RNAs were separated on a 1% agarose, 2.2 mformaldehyde gel and transferred to MSI nylon by diffusion using 10 × SSC. The transferred RNA was probed with a [32P]dATP random primed 1400-bp GP1 cDNA. After washing in 0.1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 20 min, the blot was exposed to Kodak XAR film. Guinea pig testis was homogenized in 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 4.6% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.001% bromphenol blue, and boiled for 5 min. Total protein was separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane in 49.6 mm Tris, 384 mm glycine, 0.01% SDS. After blocking in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, 3% evaporated milk, rabbit polyclonal anti-SVP-4 (082294), mouse anti-SVP-1 (MCM2), or rabbit polyclonal anti-SVP-1 (081694), antisera were added. In some cases, antisera were incubated on ice in the presence of seminal vesicle proteins prior to addition. After incubation with antibodies, transfers were washed with 20 mm Tris, 150 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween three times. Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-mouse Ig (Amersham Corp., No. NA931) or anti-rabbit Ig (Amersham, No. NA934) were used as secondary antibodies. Antibody:antigen complex was detected using Amersham ECL Western blotting signal detection reagent (No. RPN2109). 5′-RACE was performed with a 5′-RACE kit (Life Technologies, Inc., No. 18374–025). Oligonucleotides specific for TSM1 (35299), TSM2 (35191), and TSM1–3 (35503) were used for reverse transcription (see sequence below). After dC-tailing with deoxynucleotidyl transferase, PCR was performed with deoxyinosine-containing anchor primer and nested oligonucleotides that would recognize TSM1–3 (35122 and 35479). Amplified DNA was cloned into pCR2.1 using TA cloning kit (Invitrogen; Cat. K2000–01) and sequenced: 35299, 5′-CAGCAGAGATCATAGAG-3′ (complementary to nts 284–300 shown on Fig. 2); 35191, 5′-ATCACAAAGTTTCCAGTG-3′ (complementary to nts 239–243, 397–409); 35503, 5′-ACCAATCTCTCTGGAAC-3′ (complementary to nts 488–504); 35122, 5′-GATCACTAGTCCTACGCAGTGCCTCTTC-3′; and 35479, 5′-GATCACTAGTAGGCATATGATGTCAGAGAC-3′. To make full-length TSM1–3 clones, a 1321-bp fragment containing the 3′ end of TSM1–3 was amplified using PCR and cloned into the BstXI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3 (pcDNA3/3′). Oligonucleotides A and B were synthesized and used to amplify the first 119 bp of RACE clone 1234.12 (product 1). Oligonucleotides C and D were synthesized and used to amplify the unique internal pieces of TSM1–3 (products 2–4). Using splicing by overlap extension (SOE), product 1 was connected to products 2–4 (18Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-533PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting fragments were cloned into pCR2.1 using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen; Cat. K2000–01). Fragments were excised from TA clones using EcoRI and BstXI and cloned into pcDNA3/3′. The resulting constructs contain full-length TSM1–3 cloned into EcoRI and XhoI sites in pcDNA3. GP1 was also cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.

TSM1–3 and GP1 cDNA clones in pcDNA3 were linearized with XhoI. In vitro transcription was performed at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence of cap analogue m7GpppG, ribonucleotides, RNasin, dithiothreitol, transcription buffer, and T7 RNA polymerase. The integrity of all transcripts was checked by denaturing electrophoresis of labeled transcripts that were synthesized in an aliquot of the transcription reaction supplemented with [32P]GTP. For in vitro translation, equimolar amounts of transcript were incubated with rabbit reticulocyte lysate (19Jackson R.J. Hunt T. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 96: 50-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) in the presence of 0.5 × translation mix (Novagen, No. 69351–1) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp., No. SJ1515) for 60 min at 30 °C. In vitro translation products were analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, the gel was fixed, dried, and analyzed using a Molecular Dynamics STORM 840 PhosphorImager. The guinea pig testis contains three different GP1G-related transcripts, none of which co-migrate with the abundant transcript produced in the seminal vesicle (GP1) (13Hagstrom J.E. Fautsch M.P. Perdok M. Vrabel A. Wieben E.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21114-21119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The smallest of the three testis transcripts is slightly larger than GP1 on denaturing gels while the two larger testis transcripts are at least 400 nts larger than the seminal vesicle mRNA (Fig. 1). To determine the structure of these testis-specific transcripts, a guinea pig testis cDNA library was screened with GP1 cDNA. Eleven positive clones were isolated and sequenced. Two of these clones, testis-specific message 1 (TSM1) and TSM2, were larger than GP1 (Fig.2). Both of these clones had 3′-UTRs and coding sequences identical to GP1, suggesting that they originated from the GP1G locus. The additional length of TSM1 and TSM2 was due to extensions of the 5′-UTRs on each clone. TSM1 contained an extra 640 bp while TSM2 was extended by 422 bp relative to GP1. The size difference between these two clones reflects both a truncated 5′ terminus on TSM2 and an internal deletion of 153 nts within the 5′-UTR of the TSM2 cDNA. The heterogeneity in the 5′-UTR sequence prompted us to rescreen the testis library in an attempt to isolate additional clones that might correspond to the third size class of testisGP1G-related mRNAs. Using the first 175 bp of TSM1 as a probe, an additional screening of the library yielded TSM3, which is identical to the other GP1G transcripts in the 3′-UTR and coding regions, but had an additional 77-bp internal deletion immediately upstream of the 153-bp deletion found in the 5′-UTR of TSM2 (Fig. 2). Since the TSM1, TSM2, and TSM3 clones have heterogeneous 5′ ends, 5′-RACE was performed to determine if these three cDNAs originated from mRNAs having a common 5′ terminus. Using three different oligonucleotides specific for TSM1, TSM2, and TSM3 to prime first strand synthesis (see “Experimental Procedures”), 16 different clones were identified and their 5′ ends mapped (Fig.3). Although there was substantial heterogeneity in the 5′ termini of the resulting RACE clones, all three TSM transcripts have larger 5′ ends compared with their cDNAs. This suggests that TSM1–3 transcripts originate from a common promoter. As noted above, the major ORF of the TSM clones can code for the same secretory proteins found in the seminal vesicle. However, the AUG codon that initiates translation of this ORF in the SV mRNA (AUG2) is preceded by an additional in-frame AUG codon in the testis mRNAs (Fig. 2, AUG1). Translation beginning at this first AUG would yield an SVP-1/-3/-4 precursor protein with an additional 15-amino acid extension to the signal peptide that is used to direct secretion of the seminal vesicle protein. Significantly, use of either of these two AUG codons would require the skipping of numerous upstream AUG codons (uAUG) present in the 5′-UTR of the testis clones. The shortest member of this group, TSM3, has 10 uAUGs before AUG1 while TSM1 has 17 AUG triplets spread throughout all 3 forward reading frames before AUG1 (Table I).Table ISummary of TSM transcriptscDNALength of mRNA (in bp)Length of 5′-UTR (in bp)Number of uAUG codonsTSM1207164617TSM2191849313TSM3184141610GP11403230 Open table in a new tab Sequence comparisons of the 5′ extensions on the TSM clones to the previously determined genomic sequence ofGP1G reveals that the proximal 237 nts of the extended 5′-UTR is derived by transcription of 5′-flanking sequences that lie immediately upstream of the first exon used in the seminal vesicle. Thus, this extended exon is 342 nts long as it is used in the testis compared with 105 nts as used in the SV (Fig.4; exon 1 and exon D). As a consequence of the extension of this exon, several conserved promoter elements that are likely to contribute to the expression of GP1G in the seminal vesicle (including a CCAAT box at −41, a TATA box at −27 and the −90 element found in most members of the REST gene family) become part of the 5′-UTR of the testis transcripts. Further analysis of the genomic sequence reveals that the internal sequence differences between TSM1–3 are due to the inclusion or exclusion of all or part of a 230 nt alternatively spliced exon located 1.5 kb upstream of the 5′ extended first coding exon (Fig. 4;exon C). TSM2 contains only the first 77 bp of exon C while TSM3 does not contain this exon at all. Two additional short exons are required to code for the 5′ termini of the TSM clones as defined by the RACE clones shown in Fig. 3 (Fig. 4, and data not shown). All of the intron-exon junctions shown in Fig. 4 conform to the GT-AG rule. From the sizes of the genomic clones containing the six exons required to code for TSM1 and TSM2, we estimate that the testis-specific promoter lies at least 30 kb upstream of the seminal vesicle promoter. The scanning hypothesis for translation initiation dictates that upstream AUG triplets should constitute a significant barrier to the translation of a downstream ORF (20Kozak M. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). As noted previously, each of the TSM clones has multiple uAUGs predicted to code for small peptide products upstream of the ORF that codes for SVP-1/-3/-4. To determine if the TSM transcripts were capable of directing the synthesis of SVP-1/-3/-4 precursors, full-length TSM constructs were used as templates for the synthesis of synthetic, capped mRNAs. Translation of each of these TSM mRNAs in vitro yielded three products that were immunoprecipitable with antisera directed against SVP-1 or SVP-4 (Fig.5). The middle translation product in each case migrates with SVP-1/-3/-4 precursor produced by in vitro translation of GP1. Although the identity of the products that migrate slower and faster than the GP1 precursor has not been established, the size of the longest product is compatible with the hypothesis that it results from the initiation of translation at AUG1. The smallest product may be a translation product from an internal AUG such as AUG3 or AUG4. We cannot rule out the possibility that the smaller translated product is a degradation product of one of the larger products. Mutational analysis of these AUGs will help delineate if multiple AUG initiation codons are used. However, these results clearly demonstrate that all three testis-specific mRNAs are capable of producing SVP-1/-3/-4 products in vitro despite the presence of multiple upstream AUGs. To determine if SVP-1 proteins are synthesized by the testis in vivo, we used both polyclonal mouse anti-SVP-1 (MCM2) or rabbit anti-SVP-1 (081694) antisera to probe Western blots of total testis proteins (Fig. 6). Both of these antisera reacted with proteins the size of SVP-1 on these blots (Fig. 6,lanes 3 and 5). In parallel experiments, proteins co-migrating with SVP-4 were specifically detected by a rabbit anti-SVP-4 antibody (Fig. 6, lane 1). Thus, antibody reactive secretory proteins co-migrating with the SV proteins are synthesized in the testis of mature guinea pigs. The data presented here demonstrate that the GP1G gene is expressed in the testis as well as the seminal vesicle, and highlight new regulatory mechanisms that are involved in the production of proteins from this locus. In particular, the structure of the novel testis cDNAs reported here reveals that the GP1G gene has a second promoter that is active in the testis. All three of the TSM cDNAs described here appear to originate from a common GC-rich region located at least 30 kb upstream of the promoter used in the seminal vesicle. The occurrence of multiple transcription start sites from this upstream promoter contrasts with the existence of a single, evolutionarily conserved start site for transcripts initiating from the downstream seminal vesicle promoter. The unique start site in the SV probably reflects the presence of a consensus TATA box located at position −27 in the downstream promoter. This TATA box, as well as a CCAAT box and a promoter element conserved in REST genes (the −90 element), are all included in the first coding exon (Fig. 4,exon D) of each of the TSM cDNAs. A similar incorporation of somatic promoter sequences into the 5′-UTR of a testis-specific mRNA has been described for the carbonic anhydrase gene in the chicken (21Mezquita J. Pau M. Mezquita C. Gene ( Amst. ). 1994; 147: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The testis-specific exon that lies to the 5′ side of the first coding exon is alternatively spliced in TSM1–3. At present, we do not know the functional consequences of these alternative splicing events. The absence of a long ORF upstream of the SVP reading frame suggests that the resulting sequence differences are restricted to 5′-UTR. Thus, there are apparently no direct consequences for the protein coding capacity of these mRNAs. It remains possible that the different 5′-UTRs could influence either the efficiency of translation and/or choice of translation start site from the TSM messages in vivo. The scanning model of translation suggests that the 43 S ribosome preinitiation complex will interact at or near the 5′ cap structure of an mRNA and migrate in the 3′ direction, sequentially evaluating the sequence until it reaches an AUG that is in an appropriate context (22Kozak M. Shatkin A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 6568-6577Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ninety percent of all mRNAs follow this dogma (23Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8147Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar). However, many proto-oncogenes and other potent regulatory proteins contain transcripts whose 5′-UTR contains multiple upstream AUGs (20Kozak M. J. Cell. Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). It has been postulated that these transcripts contain upstream AUGs as a way of regulating the expression of their protein product, and this seems likely in the case of the TSM RNAs. Translation of a synthetic mRNA corresponding to the GP1 mRNA expressed in the SV is efficient and produces a single protein (4Norvitch M.E. Harvey S. Moore J.T. Wieben E.D. Biol. Reprod. 1988; 38: 1155-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) as predicted by the scanning model. Although translation of the TSM RNAs is not as efficient as that of GP1, each of the TSM constructs directs the synthesis of at least three different products precipitable with antisera directed against SVP proteins (Fig. 5). Since GP1 yields only a single stable protein product, the accumulation of multiple products from the TSM RNAs is not easily explained by instability of a single primary translation product. An alternative trivial possibility is that the multiple translation products derive from partially degraded or truncated TSM transcripts. This hypothesis would also predict the accumulation of translation products initiated at a number of other internal AUGs within the SVP reading frame. However, no such products are detected. Thus, we favor the hypothesis that the extended 5′-UTRs of the TSM RNAs lead to a lack of precision in the initiation of translation from the SVP ORF. Specifically, it appears likely that translation of the TSM RNAs initiates at more than one of the four in-frame AUG codons near the start of the SVP ORF (marked AUG1-AUG4 in Fig. 2). The first AUG lies 15 codons upstream of the initiation codon used in the seminal vesicle while the third and fourth in-frame AUGs lie 13 and 44 codons downstream of the SV translation start site. In principle, the alternative initiation of translation could lead to alternative targeting of the translation products. Proteins initiated at the upstream AUG1 would have an extended signal sequence. Such amino-terminal extensions to functional signal sequences have been shown not to interfere with the secretion of β-thyrotropin or β-1,4-galactosyltransferase isoforms (24Russo R.N. Shaper N.L. Taatjes D.J. Shaper J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9241-9247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Januszeski M.M. Gabriel J.L. Shennan K.I. Docherty K. Gurr J.A. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). However, signal sequences have also been postulated to function as modulators of protein folding (26Pfanner N. Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 331-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Since stably folded precursor proteins are more likely to be translocation incompetent, the addition of 15 amino acids to the amino terminus may cause or reduce premature folding of SVP-1/-3/-4 protein and influence its ability to be secreted (27Eilers M. Schatz G. Nature. 1986; 322: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 28Pluckthun A. Knowles J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3951-3957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the effect of initiating translation at AUG1 is difficult to predict, it seems likely that proteins initiated at AUG3 or AUG4 would lack a cleavable signal peptide altogether and would be predicted to accumulate intracellularly. Alternative translation initiation as a mechanism for regulating protein targeting has been reported previously for probasin (29Spence A.M. Sheppard P.C. Davie J.R. Matuo Y. Nishi N. McKeehan W.L. Dodd J.G. Matusik R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7843-7847Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this case, translation initiation at a downstream AUG results in the synthesis of a probasin isoform that accumulates in the nuclei of prostatic epithelial cells. In the case of TSM1–3, it is tempting to speculate that intracellular forms of the SVPs could become cross-linked by transglutaminase to form part of the cytoskeleton or nuclear matrix. Of course, any use of internal AUG start codons implies a mechanism for the internal initiation of translation. Several possible mechanisms have been advanced to account for the translation of internal reading frames from cellular mRNAs (30Sonenberg N. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 31Geballe A.P. Morris D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 159-164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Several cellular mRNAs have been shown to contain internal ribosome entry sites that direct the translation of downstream reading frames without scanning the entire 5′-UTR (32Jackson R.J. Hershey J.W.B. Matthews M.B. Sonenberg N. Translational Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 71-112Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is translational initiation using a discontinuous scanning mechanism (ribosome shunting) such as that described for the initiation of translation from cauliflower mosaic virus and adenovirus mRNAs (33Futterer J. Kiss-Laszlo Z. Hohn T. Cell. 1993; 73: 789-802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 34Yueh A. Schneider R.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1557-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Further experiments will be required to determine how translation is initiated from the SVP reading frame of the TSM RNAs.

Secretory and membrane proteins in eukaryotic cells are synthesized on ribosomes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; SRP, signal recognition particle; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DSP, dithiobis succinimidylpropionate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein. membrane and targeted by means of the signal recognition particle (including 7S RNA, Srp19p, Srp54p, Srp68p, Srp72p, Srp9p, and Srp14p) to the translocation machinery (for recent review see Ref. 1Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 27-303Crossref Scopus (496) Google Scholar). At the ER, the SRP-signal sequence-ribosome complex interacts via the SRP with a heterodimeric integral membrane protein called SRP receptor or docking protein, which is a complex of two GTPases, SRα and SRβ (2Tajima S. Lauffer L. Rath V., L. Walter P. J. Cell. Biol. 1986; 03: 1167-1178Crossref Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 3Ogg S.C. Poritz M.A. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 895-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This interaction, followed by the hydrolysis of GTP by the SRP and the SRP receptor complex, leads to the release of the signal sequence from the SRP and its insertion into the translocation machinery and allows the dissociation of the SRP from the membrane (4Connoly T. Gilmore R. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 23: 799-807Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The overall rate and selectivity of protein translocation across the ER suggest the presence of many interactions with different components of the translocation system including Sec61p complex (5Deshaies R.J. Schekman R. J. Cell. Biol. 1987; 5: 633-645Crossref Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 6Striling C.J. Rothblatt J. Hosobuchi M. Deshaies R. Schekman R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 129-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and other proteins that interact either directly or are in close proximity to the newly synthesized secretory proteins, such as signal peptidase (7Evans E.A. Gilmore R. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), glycosyltransferase (8Kelleher D.J. Kreibich G. Gilmore R.

Other interactions with the ribosome seem to be required for the direct transfer of the nascent chain to the protein-conducting channel. The membrane anchoring of ribosomes engaged in protein translocation is mediated by the Sec61p complex (11Kalies K.U. Görlich D. Rapoport T.A. J. Cell. Biol. 1994; 26: 925-934Crossref Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In Yarrowia lipolytica, substitutions at the G128 and A130 positions of the stem loop 1 of 7SL RNA, which forms the presumed binding site of Srp19p (12He F. Beckerich J.-M. Gaillardin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1932-1937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), have permitted selection of a thermosensitive mutant scr2.II-13. Defects in this mutant include a decrease in the synthesis of secretory proteins, preferential cleavage of the 7SL RNA, and a substantial instability of the SRP. We have reported the isolation of a suppressor of the scr2.II-13 mutation (13Ben Mamoun C. Beckerich J.-M. Gaillardin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 27: 23895-23901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This suppressor, calledtsr1-1 (thermosensitiverescued), restores normal growth to scr2.II-13 mutants (tsr1-1(scr2.II-13)) at 34 °C but not to a wild type SCR2+ strain (tsr1-1(SCR2+)). Complementation of the tsr1-1 thermosensitive phenotype has made it possible to isolate the TSR1 gene that encodes a serine threonine-rich protein of 461 amino acids with an amino-terminal leader sequence and a transmembrane domain. The present report describes the stability of the SRP in thetsr1-1(scr2.II-13) context and addresses the features of the TSR1 gene product (Tsr1p) and its relation to the SRP and translocation apparatus. We find that Tsr1p is an ER membrane protein that interacts with the SRP in the cytosol and BiP in the ER lumen and thus could play a crucial role in the translocation pathway either as a component of the translocon or as a functional intermediate between the lumen and the cytosolic side of the ER.

The pML5 plasmid containing the GST-TSR1 fusion has been obtained by cloning theBclI-EcoRI fragment carrying the TSR1 gene downstream from the GST open reading frame of the pGEX 2T vector (Stratagene). The GST-Tsr1p fusion protein was overexpressed, purified on a GST-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and used to immunize rabbits. The sera were tested and used at 1:10000 dilution for immunoblots. In pML5 containing Escherichia coli cells, these antibodies recognized a single protein with the mobility expected for the GST-Tsr1p fusion. It has been reported using the human autoimmune anti-SRP antibody that the stability of the SRP was greatly reduced in the scr2.II-13 mutant (12He F. Beckerich J.-M. Gaillardin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1932-1937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assess whether the suppressive mutation tsr1-1 could repair this instability, cell lysates from scr2.II-13,tsr1-1(scr2.II-13), and wild type strains were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Sec65p antibody. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 6% polyacrylamide, 8.3 m urea denaturing gel and hybridized with an SCR2 probe (Fig.1 A). Contrary to thescr2.II-13 mutant where immunoprecipitated 7SL RNA represented only 2–3% of the wild type, the immunoprecipitability of the 7SL RNA was completely restored in thetsr1-1(scr2.II-13) strain. These results indicate clearly that the suppressive tsr1-1 mutation stabilizes the mutant SRP. The level of total cellular 7SL RNA was quantitated in the three strains analyzed (Fig. 1 A′). Nearly identical levels of 7SL RNA were observed in the revertant and wild type strains, whereas scr2.II-13 accumulated more RNA, probably to compensate for the decreased stability of the SRP in this mutant. Results shown in Fig. 1 A indicate that the 7SL RNA was still cleaved in the tsr1-1(scr2.II-13) strain. To examine whether tsr1-1-mediated stabilization of the SRP mutant may involve ribosomes, we analyzed by Northern hybridization the amount of 5.8S rRNA in the three immunoprecipitates. Results in Fig. 1(B and B′) show that whereas the level of SRP-associated 5.8S rRNA was quite similar in bothscr2.II-13 and wild type strains, this level was increased three to four times in the suppressed straintsr1-1(scr2.II-13). From these data we concluded that the suppressive effect of tsr1-1 may result in a tighter association of ribosomes with the mutated SRP. We generated polyclonal antibodies directed against a GST-Tsr1p fusion protein (see “Experimental Procedures”). On a Western blot of total cell extract treated with 4% Triton X-100, (Fig.2 A), the immune serum (lane 2) but not the preimmune serum (lane 1) recognized a 50-kDa protein. To determine the in vivolocalization of the Tsr1p, extracts obtained from wild type cells by gentle spheroplast lysis were fractionated by differential centrifugation: 10 min at 10,000 × g followed by 20 min at 30,000 × g. At each stage, the supernatants and the pellets were collected and prepared for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were tranferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and the immunoblot was decorated with Tsr1p antibodies. Fig. 2 A (lanes 3–6) demonstrates that most of Tsr1p fractionated in the 10,000 ×g pellet. The preferential association of Tsr1p with rapidly sedimenting material seems compatible with a mitochondrial or ER localization (18Walworth N.C. Urban-Grimal D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 31: 335-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The sequence analysis of Tsr1p highlighted a transmembrane domain (13Ben Mamoun C. Beckerich J.-M. Gaillardin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 27: 23895-23901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To confirm that Tsr1p was indeed a membrane-spanning protein, spheroplasts were gently lysed, and cellular membranes were sedimented by a 10,000 × gcentrifugation. The resuspended membrane pellet was subjected to a set of treatments followed by a centrifugation at high speed, and evaluation of the supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by immunoblot using the anti-GST-Tsr1p polyclonal antibodies. Agents that release peripheral proteins associated with membranes by weak electrostatic bonds (2.5 m urea, 0.5 m acetate, 0.1 m carbonate at pH 11.5) had no effect on the fractionation of Tsr1p (Fig. 2 B). Harsher treatments were more effective: 7.3 m urea or 2 m thiocyanate stripped 35–45% of Tsr1p from the membranes, whereas Triton X-100 and Triton X-114 stripped 85–90%. These results indicate that Tsr1p is a transmembrane protein. To examine the topology of Tsr1p in the membrane, the 10,000 × g membrane fraction was subjected to digestion by 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K in the presence or the absence of 4% Triton X-100. After quenching of the reaction with 25% trichloroacetic acid, samples were resolved by a 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted with the GST-Tsr1p polyclonal antibody. Results in Fig. 3show that in the absence of detergent, Tsr1p was digested to a 34-kDa resistant fragment, which is compatible with a removal of the Tsr1p carboxyl terminus and suggests that this domain is localized on the cytosolic side. In the presence of 4% Triton X-100, Tsr1p was completely proteolyzed. To address whether Tsr1p was an ER membrane protein, spheroplasts were gently lysed, and cellular membranes were subfractionated in a sucrose gradient into 22 fractions and analyzed using antibodies raised against Tsr1p and Kar2p. Whereas most cellular protein was found in the fractions F15 and F17 (Fig.4 A), results in Fig.4 B show that Tsr1p and Kar2p were both localized in the fractions F11 and F12. This colocalization between Tsr1p and Kar2p supports the conclusion that Tsr1p is an ER component. To address the interactions of Tsr1p with the SRP or components of the translocation apparatus, we examined the coimmunoprecipitation of the 7SL RNA, Sec65p, 5.8S rRNA, and Kar2p using the GST-Tsr1p polyclonal antibody. Cells from wild type strain were grown overnight to early-log phase and 1 A 600 × ml were collected. Cell lysates were treated or not with DSP and immunoprecipitated with the GST-Tsr1p polyclonal antibody. RNAs were recovered from the immunoprecipitates, analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide, 8.3 murea denaturing gel and hybridized with an SCR2 probe. Results in Fig. 5 A show that the anti-Tsr1p antibody precipitated a small fraction of SRP RNA that is compatible with an interaction between Tsr1p and the SRP. To confirm this interpretation, proteins recovered from the immunoprecipitates were analyzed on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose filter, and decorated with the Sec65p serum. Results in Fig.5 B show that a significant immunoprecipitation of Sec65p was obtained after treatment with 4% Triton X-100 followed by cross-linking using DSP. This treatment increases the accessibility of DSP to molecular complexes between Tsr1p and other proteins. Comparing the amount of Sec65p in the supernantant and in the immunoprecipitates, 65% of Sec65p has been estimated to interact with Tsr1p (data not shown). Both immunoprecipitation of 7SL RNA and Sec65p indicate clearly that Tsr1p interacts with the SRP. To understand whether this interaction is obtained with free SRP or within a SRP-ribosome complex, we have examined the coimmunoprecipitation of 5.8S rRNA with the Tsr1p. Results in Fig. 6 A show that a clear immunoprecipitation of 5.8S rRNA is obtained with the Tsr1p antibodies, suggesting that the Tsr1p interacts with the SRP while coupled to ribosomes. To test whether the Tsr1p could interact through its lumenal domain with components of the ER lumen, we have tested the coimmunoprecipitation of Kar2p with the Tsr1p. Results in Fig.6 B show that in the case of Kar2p, coimmunoprecipitation is detected even without DSP treatment.Figure 6Coimmunoprecipitation of rRNA 5.8S and Kar2p.

Its membrane localization suggests that it may involve its amino-terminal and its carboxyl-terminal domains, respectively, in each of these interactions. We have previously described the isolation of thetsr1-1 mutation as a suppressor of the thermosensitivity conferred by scr2.II-13, a mutation of the SRP RNA that results in defects in the translocation of secretory proteins and destabilizes the SRP in the yeast Y. lipolytica (13Ben Mamoun C. Beckerich J.-M. Gaillardin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 27: 23895-23901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (11) Google Scholar).tsr1-1 restored normal growth to scr2.II-13 mutants but resulted in a thermosensitive phenotype at 34 °C in a wild type SCR2 context associated with severe defects in the early steps of the translocation pathway. We further cloned and described the new and essential gene TSR1, whose expression restored thermoresistance and translocation to atsr1-1(SCR2+) strain. Based on these data, we concluded that the TSR1 gene product played an essential role in the SRP-dependent translocation apparatus. To get further insights into its function, we analyzed the product of TSR1 and its interactions with the components of the SRP and the translocation machinery. Tsr1p is a serine-threonine-rich protein of 461 amino acids that shows extensive homology with two putative proteins Yhc8p fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Ylu2p from Hansenula polymorpha (19Agaphonov M.O. Poznyakovsky A.I. Bogdanova A.I. Treavanessyan M.D. Yeast. 1994; 10: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The presence of an amino-terminal signal sequence and of a membrane spanning domain suggested that Tsr1p was an integral membrane protein of the ER membrane. Immunoblot experiments using a Tsr1p antiserum revealed a protein with a molecular mass of ± 50 kDa in close agreement with predictions derived from sequencing data. Using cell fractionation experiments we have demonstrated that Tsr1p was associated with a rapidly sedimenting fraction and required treatment with detergents to be solubilized. Proteinase K treatment in the absence of detergent showed that the Tsr1p molecular mass shifted from 50 to 34 kDa, which is compatible with the removal of its carboxyl-terminal domain. Fractionation experiments show a significant colocalization between Tsr1p and Kar2p. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that Tsr1p is a type I transmembrane protein of the ER, exposing its carboxyl-terminal to the cytoplasm and its amino-terminal to the ER lumen. Genetic and biochemical interactions indicated that Tsr1p interacts with components of the SRP and of the translocation apparatus. First, the tsr1-1 mutation was isolated as an allele-specific suppressor of a 7SL RNA mutation scr2.II-13. Second, immunoprecipitation analysis using anti-Sec65p antibodies showed that contrary to an scr2.II-13 mutant, where little 7SL RNA was coimmunoprecipitated with Sec65p, intsr1-1(scr2.II-13) suppressed cells, the SRP stability was completely restored. Third, the Tsr1p antiserum immunoprecipitated, in a wild type strain, the SRP-ribosome complex as judged by the coimmunoprecipitation of Sec65p, rRNA 5.8S, and 7SL RNA. Coimmunoprecipitation by the Tsr1p antiserum of Kar2p, an ER lumenal chaperone protein from the HSP70 class, was detected even without cross-linking and suggests a strong interaction between these two proteins. This interaction appears very important because recent results have shown that binding of secretory precursor polypeptides to a translocon subcomplex is regulated by BiP (20Lyman S.K. Schekman R. Cell. 1997; 88: 85-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and that Kar2p can act in cooperation with some components of the translocon to stimulate translocation by pulling the secretory protein precursors across the ER membrane (21Panzner S. Dreier L. Hartmann E. Kostka S. Rapoport T.A. Cell. 1995; 81: 561-570Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 22Sanders S., L. Schekman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13791-13794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together our results indicate clearly that Tsr1p participates in a complex involving these components, and because TSR1 is an essential gene, we have to conclude that it can play an important role in the SRP-dependent translocation events at least. How does the mutated Tsr1p suppress the scr2.II-13 defect? Our results show that it does not restore an almost wild type structure to an SRP containing a defective scr2.II-13 mutant RNA, because this RNA is still as susceptible to degradation as it was in the original TSR1+ background. This nucleolytic cleavage seems to reflect a secondary effect of the mutation, not directly responsible for the secretory defect. We observed that in atsr1-1(scr2.II-13) strain, a ribosomal component, the 5.8S RNA, was much more efficiently coimmunoprecipitated by antibodies directed against Sec65p, a SRP component, than it was in aTSR1+ strain, mutated or not for the 7SL RNA. This strongly suggests that tsr1-1 reinforces or stabilizes interactions between SRP and the ribosome at the docking or at the translocation site. Because the primary defect ofscr2.II-13-mutated SRP has been postulated to involve inefficient targeting of this SRP to the ER, it is tempting to speculate that tsr1-1 may suppress scr2.II-13 by increasing the half-life of the ribosome complex at the receptor or translocation site. Conversely, this would account for the deleterious effect of tsr1-1 in an SCR2+ context, where the clearance time would be unduly lengthened. What would then be the function of wild type Tsr1p? In the above scheme, Tsr1p would be required to accelerate dissociation of the SRP from the ribosome. Recent work from Bacher et al. (23Bacher G. Lütcke H. Jungnickel B. Rapoport T.A. Dobberstein B. Nature. 1996; 381: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) suggests that ribosomes play a crucial role in the GTPase cycle of the SRP, acting as GTP loading factors for SRP54 in the presence of a signal peptide and strengthening the SRP-ribosome complex. Dissociation of the complex is thought to occur at the SRP receptor, where a GTP-loaded SRP receptor α subunit activates the GTPase activity of SRP54. Activation of SRP receptor α by GTP requires an unknown partner, which may be the translocon or a translocon-associated protein. A likely place for Tsr1p in this puzzle would be at this level, where it could gauge through its lumenal domain, possibly through Kar2p interaction, the state of clearance of the translocon and control SRP-ribosome dissociation through its cytoplasmic domain. The recent identification of a TSR1 functional homologue inS. cerevisiae 2C. Ben Mamoun, J.-M. Beckerich, and C. Gaillardin, manuscript in preparation.should permit testing these possibilities.
