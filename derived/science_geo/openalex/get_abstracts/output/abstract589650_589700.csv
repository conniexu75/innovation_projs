https://openalex.org/W2725448720,"Oscillating materials that adapt their shapes in response to external stimuli are of interest for emerging applications in medicine and robotics. For example, liquid-crystal networks can be programmed to undergo stimulus-induced deformations in various geometries, including in response to light. Azobenzene molecules are often incorporated into liquid-crystal polymer films to make them photoresponsive; however, in most cases only the bending responses of these films have been studied, and relaxation after photo-isomerization is rather slow. Modifying the core or adding substituents to the azobenzene moiety can lead to marked changes in photophysical and photochemical properties, providing an opportunity to circumvent the use of a complex set-up that involves multiple light sources, lenses or mirrors. Here, by incorporating azobenzene derivatives with fast cis-to-trans thermal relaxation into liquid-crystal networks, we generate photoactive polymer films that exhibit continuous, directional, macroscopic mechanical waves under constant light illumination, with a feedback loop that is driven by self-shadowing. We explain the mechanism of wave generation using a theoretical model and numerical simulations, which show good qualitative agreement with our experiments. We also demonstrate the potential application of our photoactive films in light-driven locomotion and self-cleaning surfaces, and anticipate further applications in fields such as photomechanical energy harvesting and miniaturized transport."
https://openalex.org/W2729982732,"The on-chip generation of high-dimensional frequency-entangled states and their spectral-domain manipulation are demonstrated, introducing a powerful and practical platform for quantum information processing. Qubits, the quantum version of bits, are constructed from two-level quantum systems, but in principle a quantum information processor could exploit higher-dimensional quantum systems for operation. These systems with an arbitrary number of levels are often termed qudits and can be generated, for example, from photons. Using qudits instead of qubits can increase sensitivity in quantum imaging and can boost quantum communication schemes. Here, Michael Kues et al. generate two entangled qudits on an integrated photonic chip using a four-wave mixing process. Each qudit encodes a 10-dimensional state, enabling the realization of a quantum system with 100 dimensions. This technique could find application in fibre-based quantum communications. Optical quantum states based on entangled photons are essential for solving questions in fundamental physics and are at the heart of quantum information science1. Specifically, the realization of high-dimensional states (D-level quantum systems, that is, qudits, with D > 2) and their control are necessary for fundamental investigations of quantum mechanics2, for increasing the sensitivity of quantum imaging schemes3, for improving the robustness and key rate of quantum communication protocols4, for enabling a richer variety of quantum simulations5, and for achieving more efficient and error-tolerant quantum computation6. Integrated photonics has recently become a leading platform for the compact, cost-efficient, and stable generation and processing of non-classical optical states7. However, so far, integrated entangled quantum sources have been limited to qubits (D = 2)8,9,10,11. Here we demonstrate on-chip generation of entangled qudit states, where the photons are created in a coherent superposition of multiple high-purity frequency modes. In particular, we confirm the realization of a quantum system with at least one hundred dimensions, formed by two entangled qudits with D = 10. Furthermore, using state-of-the-art, yet off-the-shelf telecommunications components, we introduce a coherent manipulation platform with which to control frequency-entangled states, capable of performing deterministic high-dimensional gate operations. We validate this platform by measuring Bell inequality violations and performing quantum state tomography. Our work enables the generation and processing of high-dimensional quantum states in a single spatial mode."

Genome-wide association studies have identified 200 inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci, but few have been conclusively resolved to specific functional variants. Here we report fine-mapping of 94 inflammatory bowel disease loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals. We pinpoint 18 associations to a single causal variant with greater than 95% certainty, and an additional 27 associations to a single variant with greater than 50% certainty. These 45 variants are significantly enriched for protein-coding changes (n = 13), direct disruption of transcription-factor binding sites (n = 3), and tissue-specific epigenetic marks (n = 10), with the last category showing enrichment in specific immune cells among associations stronger in Crohn’s disease and in gut mucosa among associations stronger in ulcerative colitis. The results of this study suggest that high-resolution fine-mapping in large samples can convert many discoveries from genome-wide association studies into statistically convincing causal variants, providing a powerful substrate for experimental elucidation of disease mechanisms. Results of fine-mapping 94 inflammatory bowel disease loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals and several new fine-mapping methods. Genome-wide association studies for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have identified over 200 associated loci but the causal variants at only several of these individual loci have been resolved. Here, Hailiang Hang and colleagues report fine-mapping of 94 of these IBD susceptibility loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals. They apply several new fine-mapping methods and identify 139 independent associations, 18 of which are resolved to a single causal variant with >95% certainty. This provides an example of how fine-mapping with high-density genotyping in large sample sizes is able to resolve causal variants at GWAS loci, an approach that may be used for other complex traits.

https://openalex.org/W2724571272,"Genomic analysis of tumours has led to the identification of hundreds of cancer genes on the basis of the presence of mutations in protein-coding regions. By contrast, much less is known about cancer-causing mutations in non-coding regions. Here we perform deep sequencing in 360 primary breast cancers and develop computational methods to identify significantly mutated promoters. Clear signals are found in the promoters of three genes. FOXA1, a known driver of hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, harbours a mutational hotspot in its promoter leading to overexpression through increased E2F binding. RMRP and NEAT1, two non-coding RNA genes, carry mutations that affect protein binding to their promoters and alter expression levels. Our study shows that promoter regions harbour recurrent mutations in cancer with functional consequences and that the mutations occur at similar frequencies as in coding regions. Power analyses indicate that more such regions remain to be discovered through deep sequencing of adequately sized cohorts of patients. High-depth sequencing of targeted regions in primary breast cancer identifies mutated promoter elements with recurrent mutations at specific and/or nearby bases, suggesting selection of certain non-coding events. Many cancer genomic studies have characterized the landscape of driver mutations in protein-coding regions, but there has been limited exploration of non-coding regions. Gad Getz and colleagues searched for significantly mutated regulatory regions with high-depth sequencing of targeted regions in 360 primary breast cancers. They identified significantly mutated promoter elements associated with nine genes, and found recurrent mutations at specific and/or nearby bases, suggesting targeting of a specific element. For three of these genes, FOXA1, RMRP and NEAT1, they show that these recurrent promoter-proximal mutations influence gene expression and protein binding affinity. The authors suggest that further deep sequencing studies in larger cohorts could identify more as yet undiscovered promoter regions."
https://openalex.org/W2684441367,"Mechanosensory transduction for senses such as proprioception, touch, balance, acceleration, hearing and pain relies on mechanotransduction channels, which convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals in specialized sensory cells. How force gates mechanotransduction channels is a central question in the field, for which there are two major models. One is the membrane-tension model: force applied to the membrane generates a change in membrane tension that is sufficient to gate the channel, as in the bacterial MscL channel and certain eukaryotic potassium channels. The other is the tether model: force is transmitted via a tether to gate the channel. The transient receptor potential (TRP) channel NOMPC is important for mechanosensation-related behaviours such as locomotion, touch and sound sensation across different species including Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and zebrafish. NOMPC is the founding member of the TRPN subfamily, and is thought to be gated by tethering of its ankyrin repeat domain to microtubules of the cytoskeleton. Thus, a goal of studying NOMPC is to reveal the underlying mechanism of force-induced gating, which could serve as a paradigm of the tether model. NOMPC fulfils all the criteria that apply to mechanotransduction channels and has 29 ankyrin repeats, the largest number among TRP channels. A key question is how the long ankyrin repeat domain is organized as a tether that can trigger channel gating. Here we present a de novo atomic structure of Drosophila NOMPC determined by single-particle electron cryo-microscopy. Structural analysis suggests that the ankyrin repeat domain of NOMPC resembles a helical spring, suggesting its role of linking mechanical displacement of the cytoskeleton to the opening of the channel. The NOMPC architecture underscores the basis of translating mechanical force into an electrical signal within a cell."
https://openalex.org/W2733406733,"Activation of the PTEN-PI3K-mTORC1 pathway consolidates metabolic programs that sustain cancer cell growth and proliferation. Here we show that mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates polyamine dynamics, a metabolic route that is essential for oncogenicity. By using integrative metabolomics in a mouse model and human biopsies of prostate cancer, we identify alterations in tumours affecting the production of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine (dcSAM) and polyamine synthesis. Mechanistically, this metabolic rewiring stems from mTORC1-dependent regulation of S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase 1 (AMD1) stability. This novel molecular regulation is validated in mouse and human cancer specimens. AMD1 is upregulated in human prostate cancer with activated mTORC1. Conversely, samples from a clinical trial with the mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus exhibit a predominant decrease in AMD1 immunoreactivity that is associated with a decrease in proliferation, in line with the requirement of dcSAM production for oncogenicity. These findings provide fundamental information about the complex regulatory landscape controlled by mTORC1 to integrate and translate growth signals into an oncogenic metabolic program."
https://openalex.org/W2731078159,"Genetically engineered ‘lymphoreporter’ mouse strains are used to track melanoma dissemination in vivo, identifying midkine as a tumour-secreted factor that acts at a distance, preparing pre-metastatic niches and serving as an indicator of poor prognosis in patients. Lymph nodes are a common metastatic site of many tumour types, including melanomas. The contribution of lymphangiogenesis to metastatic progression is not well defined, as removing the sentinel lymph node does not always improve the survival chances of melanoma patients. Here the authors develop a 'lymphoreporter' mouse model that allows them to track lymphatic vessels with a VEGFR3 reporter, and use it to visualize metastatic routes during relapse. In addition, the authors identify a mediator of lymphangiogenesis, MIDKINE, that contributes to metastasis and indicates a poor prognosis for patients with melanoma. The authors suggest that VEGFR3 reporters could be useful in the search for further drivers and inhibitors of metastasis. Cutaneous melanoma is a type of cancer with an inherent potential for lymph node colonization, which is generally preceded by neolymphangiogenesis1,2,3. However, sentinel lymph node removal does not necessarily extend the overall survival of patients with melanoma4,5. Moreover, lymphatic vessels collapse and become dysfunctional as melanomas progress6,7. Therefore, it is unclear whether (and how) lymphangiogenesis contributes to visceral metastasis. Soluble and vesicle-associated proteins secreted by tumours and/or their stroma have been proposed to condition pre-metastatic sites in patients with melanoma8,9,10,11,12,13,14. Still, the identities and prognostic value of lymphangiogenic mediators remain unclear2,14. Moreover, our understanding of lymphangiogenesis (in melanomas and other tumour types) is limited by the paucity of mouse models for live imaging of distal pre-metastatic niches15. Injectable lymphatic tracers have been developed7, but their limited diffusion precludes whole-body imaging at visceral sites16. Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3 (VEGFR3) is an attractive ‘lymphoreporter’17 because its expression is strongly downregulated in normal adult lymphatic endothelial cells, but is activated in pathological situations such as inflammation and cancer17,18. Here, we exploit this inducibility of VEGFR3 to engineer mouse melanoma models for whole-body imaging of metastasis generated by human cells, clinical biopsies or endogenously deregulated oncogenic pathways. This strategy revealed early induction of distal pre-metastatic niches uncoupled from lymphangiogenesis at primary lesions. Analyses of the melanoma secretome and validation in clinical specimens showed that the heparin-binding factor midkine is a systemic inducer of neo-lymphangiogenesis that defines patient prognosis. This role of midkine was linked to a paracrine activation of the mTOR pathway in lymphatic endothelial cells. These data support the use of VEGFR3 reporter mice as a ‘MetAlert’ discovery platform for drivers and inhibitors of metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2731174375,"The function of most human long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) remains unclear. Our studies identified a highly up-regulated mammalian lncRNA, FOXD3-AS1, known as linc1623 in mice, in the setting of hyperoxia/reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced lung injury. We found that ROS induced a robust expression of FOXD3-AS1 in mouse lung tissue. Functionally, FOXD3-AS1 promoted oxidative stress-induced lung epithelial cell death. In human lung epithelial cells, the microRNA-150 (miR-150) was identified to interact with FOXD3-AS1; this finding was confirmed using the luciferase reporter assays. Consistently, mutation on the miR-150 pairing sequence in FOXD3-AS1 abolished the interactions between FOXD3-AS1 and miR-150. Additionally, miR-150 mimics suppressed the level of FOXD3-AS1. The antisense oligos of FOXD3-AS1 significantly augmented the intracellular level of miR-150, supporting the theory of sponging effects of FOXD3-AS1 on miR-150. We further investigated the cellular function of miR-150 in our lung injury models. MiR-150 conferred a cytoprotective role in lung epithelial cells after oxidative stress, whereas FOXD3-AS1 promoted cell death. Taken together, our studies indicated that FOXD3-AS1 serves as a sponge or as a competing endogenous noncoding RNA for miR-150, restricting its capability to promote cell growth and thereby exaggerating hyperoxia-induced lung epithelial cell death.-Zhang, D., Lee, H., Haspel, J. A., Jin, Y. Long noncoding RNA FOXD3-AS1 regulates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis via sponging microRNA-150."
https://openalex.org/W2733982302,"Sauropod dinosaurs include the largest terrestrial animals and are considered to have uninterrupted rapid rates of growth, which differs from their more basal relatives, which have a slower cyclical growth. Here we examine the bone microstructure of several sauropodomorph dinosaurs, including basal taxa, as well as the more derived sauropods. Although our results agree that the plesiomorphic condition for Sauropodomorpha is cyclical growth dynamics, we found that the hypothesized dichotomy between the growth patterns of basal and more derived sauropodomorphs is not supported. Here, we show that sauropod-like growth dynamics of uninterrupted rapid growth also occurred in some basal sauropodomorphs, and that some basal sauropods retained the plesiomorphic cyclical growth patterns. Among the sauropodomorpha it appears that the basal taxa exploited different growth strategies, but the more derived Eusauropoda successfully utilized rapid, uninterrupted growth strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2726015290,"RNase III from all three domains of life elicits RNA-targeting antiviral activity that is independent of, and possibly predates, other known eukaryotic antiviral systems. Benjamin tenOever and colleagues reveal a direct antiviral role for the mammalian RNase III protein Drosher that is unrelated to its role in miRNA metabolism. They propose that it acts as an antiviral clamp that recognizes RNA structures commonly found in positive-stranded RNA viruses and impedes the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. They also show that this activity can be observed in RNase III nucleases from diverse domains of life, suggesting that it may have represented an ancient antiviral system. In contrast to the DNA-based viruses in prokaryotes, the emergence of eukaryotes provided the necessary compartmentalization and membranous environment for RNA viruses to flourish, creating the need for an RNA-targeting antiviral system1,2. Present day eukaryotes employ at least two main defence strategies that emerged as a result of this viral shift, namely antiviral RNA interference and the interferon system2. Here we demonstrate that Drosha and related RNase III ribonucleases from all three domains of life also elicit a unique RNA-targeting antiviral activity. Systemic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment of this class of proteins illustrates the recognition of unbranched RNA stem loops. Biochemical analyses reveal that, in this context, Drosha functions as an antiviral clamp, conferring steric hindrance on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of diverse positive-stranded RNA viruses. We present evidence for cytoplasmic translocation of RNase III nucleases in response to virus in diverse eukaryotes including plants, arthropods, fish, and mammals. These data implicate RNase III recognition of viral RNA as an antiviral defence that is independent of, and possibly predates, other known eukaryotic antiviral systems."
https://openalex.org/W2729327121,"The solute carrier family 13 member 5 (SLC13A5), a sodium-coupled citrate transporter, plays a key role in importing citrate from the circulation into liver cells. Recent evidence has revealed that SLC13A5 deletion protects mice from high-fat diet–induced hepatic steatosis and that mutation of the SLC13A5 orthologues in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans promotes longevity. However, despite the emerging importance of SLC13A5 in energy homeostasis, whether perturbation of SLC13A5 affects the metabolism and malignancy of hepatocellular carcinoma is unknown. Here, we sought to determine whether SLC13A5 regulates hepatic energy homeostasis and proliferation of hepatoma cells. RNAi-mediated silencing of SLC13A5 expression in two human hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 and Huh7, profoundly suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation, and induced cell cycle arrest accompanied by increased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 and decreased expression of cyclin B1. Furthermore, such suppressive effects were also observed on the growth of HepG2 cell-derived xenografts expressing SLC13A5-shRNA in nude mice. Metabolically, knockdown of SLC13A5 in HepG2 and Huh7 cells was associated with a decrease in intracellular levels of citrate, the ratio of ATP/ADP, phospholipid content, and ATP citrate lyase expression. Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo assays demonstrated that SLC13A5 depletion promotes activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase, which was accompanied by deactivation of oncogenic mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling. Together, our findings expand the role of SLC13A5 from facilitating hepatic energy homeostasis to influencing hepatoma cell proliferation and suggest a potential role of SLC13A5 in the progression of human hepatocellular carcinoma."

https://openalex.org/W2728979721,"Sirtuin 7 (SIRT7), a member of the NAD+-dependent class III histone deacetylases, is involved in the regulation of various cellular processes and in resisting various stresses, such as hypoxia, low glucose levels, and DNA damage. Interestingly, SIRT7 is linked to the control of glycolysis, suggesting a role in glucose metabolism. Given the important roles of SIRT7, it is critical to clarify how SIRT7 activity is potentially regulated. It has been reported that some transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms are involved. However, little is known how SIRT7 is regulated by the post-translational modifications. Here, we identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7), a deubiquitinase, as a negative regulator of SIRT7. We showed that USP7 interacts with SIRT7 both in vitro and in vivo, and we further demonstrated that SIRT7 undergoes endogenous Lys-63-linked polyubiquitination, which is removed by USP7. Although the USP7-mediated deubiquitination of SIRT7 had no effect on its stability, the deubiquitination repressed its enzymatic activity. We also showed that USP7 coordinates with SIRT7 to regulate the expression of glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit (G6PC), a gluconeogenic gene. USP7 depletion by RNA interference increased both G6PC expression and SIRT7 enzymatic activity. Moreover, SIRT7 targeted the G6PC promoter through the transcription factor ELK4 but not through forkhead box O1 (FoxO1). In summary, SIRT7 is a USP7 substrate and has a novel role as a regulator of gluconeogenesis. Our study may provide the basis for new clinical approaches to treat metabolic disorders related to glucose metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2732355947,"Citizen science has become more popular in recent years, quickly taking on a variety of potentially conflicting characteristics: a way to collect massive data sets at relatively low cost, a way to break science out of the ivory tower and better engage the public, an approach to educate lay people in scientific methods. But the extent of current citizen science practice-the types of actors and scientific disciplines who take part-is still poorly understood. This article builds on recent surveys of citizen science in PLOS One by analyzing citizen science practice in Germany and Austria through the projects on two online platforms. We find evidence supporting previous findings that citizen science is a phenomenon strongest in biodiversity and environmental monitoring research, but at home in a number of scientific fields, such as history and geography. In addition, our survey method yields new insights into citizen science projects initiated by non-scientific actors. We close by discussing additional methodological considerations in attempting to present a cross-disciplinary overview of citizen science."

https://openalex.org/W2733075522,"Annexin A1 (AnxA1) is a glucocorticoid-regulated protein known for its anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving effects. We have shown previously that the cAMP-enhancing compounds rolipram (ROL; a PDE4 inhibitor) and Bt2cAMP (a cAMP mimetic) drive caspase-dependent resolution of neutrophilic inflammation. In this follow-up study, we investigated whether AnxA1 could be involved in the pro-resolving properties of these compounds using a model of LPS-induced inflammation in BALB/c mice. The treatment with ROL or Bt2cAMP at the peak of inflammation shortened resolution intervals, improved resolution indices, and increased AnxA1 expression. In vitro studies showed that ROL and Bt2cAMP induced AnxA1 expression and phosphorylation, and this effect was prevented by PKA inhibitors, suggesting the involvement of PKA in ROL-induced AnxA1 expression. Akin to these in vitro findings, H89 prevented ROL- and Bt2cAMP-induced resolution of inflammation, and it was associated with decreased levels of intact AnxA1.

We have shown previously that rolipram (ROL), a selective phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) inhibitor that increases intracellular levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), induces resolution of neutrophilic inflammation, and it was associated with increased accumulation of AnxA1 in inflammatory cells (20.Vago J.P.

However, the relevance and mechanisms underlying ROL-induced AnxA1 expression remain unknown. In addition to the known anti-inflammatory properties of cAMP-elevating agents (27.Teixeira M.M. al-Rashed S. Rossi A.G. Hellewell P.G.

Indeed, cAMP elevation promoted by treatment with ROL or by cAMP-mimetic drugs during established eosinophilic or neutrophilic inflammation induced resolution of inflammation via PKA, the best known cAMP effector (3.Sousa L.P.

Patel H.B. Seed M. Nielsen S. Jonassen T.E. Perretti M. The melanocortin agonist AP214 exerts anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties.Am. J.

Emerging roles for lysophosphatidylserine in resolution of inflammation.Prog. Lipid Res. 2012; 51: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the ability of ROL and Bt2cAMP to modulate AnxA1 expression and wondered whether AnxA1 was involved in the pro-resolving ability of these compounds. Our results demonstrate that AnxA1 is induced by cAMP-elevating agents and is indeed involved in the pro-resolving properties of these compounds, pointing to them as potential therapeutic tools to control inflammatory diseases and induce resolution of inflammation. Initially, we evaluated whether ROL (PDE4 inhibitor) and Bt2cAMP (cAMP mimetic) would improve resolution indices during acute pleurisy. In this self-resolving model of inflammation, the intrapleural injection of LPS induces a time-dependent influx of neutrophils into the pleural cavity of mice that is detectable at 2 h and reaches a maximum at 8–24 h, decreasing thereafter with resolution occurring after 48 h, as reported previously (20.Vago J.P.

Immunol. 2016; 196: 1922-1932Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we quantified the resolution interval (Ri) by defining profiles of acute inflammatory parameters (42.Bannenberg G.L. Chiang N. Ariel A. Arita M. Tjonahen E. Gotlinger K.H. Hong S. Serhan C.N. Molecular circuits of resolution: formation and actions of resolvins and protectins.J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 4345-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 43.Chiang N. Shinohara M. Dalli J. Mirakaj V. Kibi M. Choi A.M. Serhan C.N. Inhaled carbon monoxide accelerates resolution of inflammation via unique proresolving mediator-heme oxygenase-1 circuits.J. Immunol. 2013; 190: 6378-6388Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The treatment of mice with ROL or Bt2cAMP at the peak of LPS inflammation significantly reduced the number of PMNs recruited to the pleural cavity and shortened Ri in ∼12 h (Fig. 1, A and B). To investigate the potential relationship between cAMP and AnxA1, we carried out Western blot analysis in whole-cell extracts recovered from the pleural cavity of mice treated 4 h after LPS challenge (when inflammatory cell influx was already established). Western blotting was performed to quantify the overall AnxA1 content (i.e. the sum of intracellularly localized or cell surface-bound). As seen in Fig. 1 (C and D), treatment with ROL or Bt2cAMP decreased neutrophil numbers and increased levels of intact AnxA1 (Fig. 1, E and F). AnxA1 was constitutively expressed on resident cells from the pleural cavity (PBS-injected). LPS injection induced AnxA1 cleavage (as detected by the presence of the 33-kDa breakdown product), and treatment with ROL or Bt2cAMP increased levels of intact AnxA1 (37-kDa form) and reduced AnxA1 cleavage in whole inflammatory extracts when compared with LPS. Dexamethasone, used as an anti-inflammatory control drug, promoted resolution of neutrophilic inflammation and increased AnxA1 expression, as shown previously (20.Vago J.P. Nogueira C.R. Tavares L.P. Soriani F.M. Lopes F. Russo R.C. Pinho V. Teixeira M.M. Sousa L.P. Annexin A1 modulates natural and glucocorticoid-induced resolution of inflammation by enhancing neutrophil apoptosis.J. Leukocyte Biol. 2012; 92: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ROL was able to decrease neutrophil numbers and increase intact levels of AnxA1 as early as 1 h after treatment (supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). The N-terminal region of AnxA1 is the major effector portion responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of the protein, and its cleavage decreases the resolution-inducing effects of AnxA1 (10.Dalli J. Consalvo A.P. Ray V. Di Filippo C. D'Amico M. Mehta N. Perretti M. Proresolving and tissue-protective actions of annexin A1-based cleavage-resistant peptides are mediated by formyl peptide receptor 2/lipoxin A4 receptor.J.

Design and characterization of a cleavage-resistant Annexin A1 mutant to control inflammation in the microvasculature.Blood. 2010; 116: 4288-4296Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Here, we observed that ROL partially decreased LPS-induced AnxA1 cleavage, as evidenced by the lower levels of the 33-kDa fragment when compared with LPS alone (Fig. 1E). Because AnxA1 can be cleaved by elastase in vivo, we evaluated whether inhibition of elastase activity by ROL could account for the observed effect. We found that ROL decreased LPS-induced elastase activity and expression in whole-cell lysates recovered from pleural inflammatory cells (supplemental Fig. 1, C and D). The latter results suggest that ROL modulates AnxA1 levels at least by reducing its degradation. AnxA1 is present in many differentiated cell types (human and murine) but is particularly abundant in neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and mast cells (2.Perretti M. D'Acquisto F. Annexin A1 and glucocorticoids as effectors of the resolution of inflammation.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 9: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 6.Yazid S. Sinniah A. Solito E. Calder V. Flower R.J. Anti-allergic cromones inhibit histamine and eicosanoid release from activated human and murine mast cells by releasing Annexin A1.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e58963Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Protein expression can be modulated through several mechanisms, such as the mobilization of the intracellular pool of the protein to exportation and secretion, increased phosphorylation (45.Yazid S. Leoni G. Getting S.J. Cooper D. Solito E. Perretti M. Flower R.J. Antiallergic cromones inhibit neutrophil recruitment onto vascular endothelium via annexin-A1 mobilization.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2010; 30: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), or both. To explore the mechanisms underlying the effect of cAMP-elevating agents on AnxA1 expression and localization, in vitro experiments using differentiated THP-1 cells, bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs), and the murine macrophage cell line RAW264.7 were carried out. THP-1 was used in this work to evaluate the expression of AnxA1, because it has been shown to be a suitable cell line to study AnxA1 modulation (45.Yazid S. Leoni G. Getting S.J. Cooper D. Solito E.

In these experimental settings, dexamethasone (Dexa) treatment induced dose-dependent induction of AnxA1 expression (data not show). As shown in Fig. 2, treatment of THP-1 cells with ROL increased AnxA1 levels in a concentration-dependent (Fig. 2A) and time-dependent (Fig. 2C) fashion. This modulatory property was also observed in BMDM and RAW264.7 cells (supplemental Fig. 2, A–C). For more quantitative data, similar experiments were performed to quantify AnxA1 message by qPCR. Significant increases in AnxA1 mRNA were observed in THP-1 cells treated with ROL, with optimal settings at 10 μm and 6-h incubation (Fig. 2, B and D, respectively). Interestingly, ROL also increased the level of phosphorylated AnxA1 in THP-1 cells (Fig. 2E) and BMDMs (supplemental Fig. 2A). In line with the ability of ROL to inhibit degradation and increase intracellular levels of cAMP, there was strong phosphorylation of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE)-binding protein (CREB), which followed the same kinetics of AnxA1 expression (Fig. 2, A and C). In accordance with the requirement of cAMP levels to induce AnxA1 expression, a cell-permeable cAMP (Bt2cAMP) induced AnxA1 accumulation and phosphorylation (Fig. 3, A and B). Densitometry data for both AnxA1 and P-AnxA1 are represented graphically (Fig. 3C). We also measured the intracellular levels of cAMP in THP-1 cells after rolipram treatment (10 μm), and we found an increase of 20% over basal levels, which return to the baseline 2 h after. As expected for a cell-permeable cAMP, Bt2cAMP greatly increased levels of intracellular cAMP 1 h after cell treatment by 150% over basal level, decreasing thereafter but still remaining high until 2 h (85% increase over basal levels).Figure 3.Effect of Bt2cAMP and forskolin on AnxA1 expression and phosphorylation in THP-1 differentiated macrophages.

Previously, we have reported that adult rat hippocampal neural (HCN) stem cells undergo autophagic cell death (ACD) following insulin withdrawal. Because the apoptotic capability of the HCN cells was intact, our findings suggested activation of unique molecular mechanisms linking insulin withdrawal to ACD rather than apoptosis. Here, we report that phosphorylation of autophagy-associated protein p62 by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) drives ACD and mitophagy in HCN cells. Pharmacological inhibition of AMPK or genetic ablation of the AMPK α2 subunit by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 genome editing suppressed ACD, whereas AMPK activation promoted ACD in insulin-deprived HCN cells. We found that following insulin withdrawal AMPK phosphorylated p62 at a novel site, Ser-293/Ser-294 (in rat and human p62, respectively). Phosphorylated p62 translocated to mitochondria and induced mitophagy and ACD. Interestingly, p62 phosphorylation at Ser-293 was not required for staurosporine-induced apoptosis in HCN cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the direct phosphorylation of p62 by AMPK. Our data suggest that AMPK-mediated p62 phosphorylation is an ACD-specific signaling event and provide novel mechanistic insight into the molecular mechanisms in ACD.

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular degradation and recycling process characterized by an increased generation of autophagic vesicles (1.Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D.

Neurobiol. 2013; 105: 24-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Autophagosome biogenesis can be assessed by monitoring the autophagy markers microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) and p62. LC3 is a ubiquitin-like protein; pro-LC3 is cleaved by Atg4B, resulting in the cytosolic form LC3-I (5.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar). When autophagy is activated, LC3-I is enriched in autophagosomes and converted to LC3-II through conjugation with phosphatidylethanolamine (6.Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N. Tanida I. Kominami E. Ohsumi M. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. A ubiquitin-like system mediates protein lipidation.Nature. 2000; 408: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1504) Google Scholar). Therefore, LC3-II is a reliable biochemical marker of autophagosome formation (5.Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. LC3, a mammalian homologue of yeast Apg8p, is localized in autophagosome membranes after processing.EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5433) Google Scholar, 7.Suzuki K. Kirisako T. Kamada Y. Mizushima N. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. The pre-autophagosomal structure organized by concerted functions of APG genes is essential for autophagosome formation.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5971-5981Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 8.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Hatano M. Kobayashi Y. Kabeya Y. Suzuki K. Tokuhisa T. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. Dissection of autophagosome formation using Apg5-deficient mouse embryonic stem cells.J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 657-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). In a similar manner, a punctate pattern of fluorescently tagged LC3 can be indicative of autophagy induction (9.Mizushima N. Yamamoto A. Matsui M. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. In vivo analysis of autophagy in response to nutrient starvation using transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent autophagosome marker.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1101-1111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1923) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-binding protein p62 interacts with LC3-II and thereby delivers cargo molecules to autophagosomes. During this process, p62 is also degraded by autophagy (10.Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death.J.

Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 binds directly to Atg8/LC3 to facilitate degradation of ubiquitinated protein aggregates by autophagy.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24131-24145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3307) Google Scholar). Hence, a decrease in p62 is another measure of autophagic flux (12.Ichimura Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Komatsu M. Selective turnover of p62/A170/SQSTM1 by autophagy.Autophagy. 2008; 4: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). However, accumulation of autophagic vesicles at one static time point can reflect either an increase (on-rate) or decrease (off-rate) of autophagic flux with diametrically opposite implication for the role of autophagy in cell death. Therefore, description of autophagy morphology in dying cells without data to clarify the functional role of autophagy in the cell death process has led to confusion about the concept of ACD. In this regard, observation of ACD in apoptosis-defective cells or cells with suppressed apoptosis, the lack of the specific pharmacological reagents for modulation of autophagy, and other difficulties and technical concerns in addressing the exact role of autophagy in relation to cell death were well discussed by Kroemer and Levine (13.Kroemer G. Levine B. Autophagic cell death: the story of a misnomer.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). Despite the controversy, an increasing number of studies support a causative role of autophagy in cell death, especially in insects and other model organisms (14.Kourtis N. Tavernarakis N. Autophagy and cell death in model organisms.Cell Death Differ. 2009; 16: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Examples of ACD in mammals are much fewer (15.Kim N.-Y. Lee M. The pro-death role of autophagy and apoptosis in cell death induced by the BH3 mimetic gossypol.Animal Cells Syst. 2014; 18: 183-189Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). According to the criteria suggested by Shen and Codogno (16.Shen H.M. Codogno P. Autophagic cell death: Loch Ness monster or endangered species?.Autophagy. 2011; 7: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), ACD is distinguished from other modes of PCD by the lack of apoptotic features and ineffectiveness of caspase inhibition, increased autophagic flux, and dependence of cell death on autophagy-related genes (Atgs) or other key autophagy genes. We have previously demonstrated that insulin withdrawal induces ACD in adult hippocampal neural (HCN) stem cells despite their normal apoptotic capabilities. Insulin-deprived HCN cells show enhanced autophagic flux but do not display signs of apoptosis, such as caspase activation, chromosomal DNA fragmentation, and exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane (17.Yu S.W.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine/threonine protein kinase composed of a catalytic subunit (α1 or α2) and regulatory β and γ subunits (28.Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. Gao G. Widmer J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 611-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). AMPK regulates various cellular processes, including metabolic homeostasis, cell proliferation, and cell death (29.Mihaylova M.M. Shaw R.J.

Araki E. AMPK and cell proliferation—AMPK as a therapeutic target for atherosclerosis and cancer.J. Physiol. 2006; 574: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). AMPK can also induce autophagy (31.Han D. Yang B. Olson L.K. Greenstein A. Baek S.H. Claycombe K.J. Goudreau J.L. Yu S.W. Kim E.K.

Given the close connection of insulin signaling with AMPK in the regulation of cell metabolism, proliferation, survival, and autophagy, we postulated that AMPK might be intimately involved in ACD of HCN cells upon insulin withdrawal. In the present study, we found that AMPK was readily activated in insulin-deprived HCN cells and served as a critical trigger of ACD. Looking further into the molecular mechanism, we identified p62 as a new molecular target of AMPK. Although many substrates connecting AMPK to metabolism regulation are known, only a few AMPK targets relevant to autophagy have been identified so far (32.Liang J. Shao S.H. Xu Z.-X. Hennessy B.

We further report that AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of p62 is required for mitophagy and ACD following insulin withdrawal but not for apoptotic death in HCN cells. Our study suggests that novel AMPK-mediated p62 phosphorylation can be an ACD-specific signaling event and that this AMPK–p62 axis drives ACD and mitophagy in HCN cells. Our findings warrant further studies on the molecular mechanisms that link autophagy to cell death; understanding these mechanisms is required to distinguish the role of autophagy in facilitation of cell death from its general protective role. To address the role of AMPK in HCN cell death, we initially assessed the activation status of AMPK in insulin-deprived HCN cells. Hereafter, we will refer to HCN cells cultured in insulin-containing and insulin-deficient media as I(+) and I(−), respectively, as in our prior reports (19.Ha S. Ryu H.Y. Chung K.M. Baek S.-H. Kim E.-K. Yu S.-W. Regulation of autophagic cell death by glycogen synthase kinase-3β in adult hippocampal neural stem cells following insulin withdrawal.Mol. Brain. 2015; 8: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20.Chung K.M. Park H. Jung S. Ha S. Yoo S.-J. Woo H. Lee H.J. Kim S.W. Kim E.-K. Moon C. Yu S.-W. Calpain determines the propensity of adult hippocampal neural stem cells to autophagic cell death following insulin withdrawal.Stem Cells. 2015; 33: 3052-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We assessed Thr-172 phosphorylation of the AMPK α subunit because this post-translational modification in the kinase activation loop is associated with increased AMPK activity (38.Hawley S.A. Davison M. Woods A. Davies S.P. Beri R.K. Carling D. Hardie D.G. Characterization of the AMP-activated protein kinase kinase from rat liver and identification of threonine 172 as the major site at which it phosphorylates AMP-activated protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27879-27887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, 39.Stein S.C. Woods A. Jones N.A. Davison M.D. Carling D. The regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase by phosphorylation.Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Following insulin withdrawal, AMPK was rapidly activated, and the time course of its activation was well correlated with the up-regulation of autophagic flux as revealed by an increase in LC3-II and decrease in p62 (Fig. 1A). The AMPK inhibitor compound C (CC; 0.5 μm) efficiently blocked AMPK activation and substantially reduced the autophagy level and cell death in I(−) HCN cells (Fig. 1, B–D). CC also reduced the number of GFP-LC3 puncta in these cells (Fig. 1, E and F). To corroborate these results derived from the pharmacological inhibition of AMPK, we knocked out AMPK α1 or α2 subunit using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing approach. The relative levels of α1 and α2 mRNAs were similar and were not changed by insulin withdrawal (supplemental Fig. S1A). Single guide RNA sequences targeting each subunit efficiently ablated the AMPK α1 or α2 gene (supplemental Fig. S1B). Of note, the deletion of the α2 but not α1 gene markedly reduced cell death (Fig. 1, G and supplemental Fig. S1C) and autophagic flux in I(−) HCN cells (Fig. 1, H and I). These data indicated that pharmacological or genetic inactivation of AMPK substantially diminished ACD in I(−) HCN cells, suggesting a critical role of AMPK in HCN cell death following insulin withdrawal. With regard to the mechanism of AMPK activation, two upstream kinases, LKB1 and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ), are well documented to phosphorylate Thr-172 of the AMPK α subunit (40.Kim J. Yang G. Kim Y. Kim J. Ha J. AMPK activators: mechanisms of action and physiological activities.Exp. Mol. Med. 2016; 48: e224Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). AMPK is activated in response to metabolic stresses that deplete the cellular ATP level, and binding of AMP to the γ subunit allosterically activates the AMPK complex by enhancing LKB1-dependent Thr-172 phosphorylation. AMPK can also be directly phosphorylated by CaMKKβ in response to increases in intracellular Ca2+ without significant change in ATP/ADP/AMP levels (40.Kim J. Yang G. Kim Y. Kim J. Ha J. AMPK activators: mechanisms of action and physiological activities.Exp. Mol. Med. 2016; 48: e224Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). To elucidate how insulin withdrawal activated AMPK, we first examined the cellular ATP level. Interestingly, insulin withdrawal did not induce depletion of cellular ATP compared with the substantial depletion of cellular ATP by glucose deprivation for 5 h (supplemental Fig. S2A). In contrast, a specific CaMKK inhibitor, STO-609, decreased AMPK Thr-174 phosphorylation and attenuated cell death (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). Our previous report also demonstrated an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ level that was due to ryanodine receptor 3-mediated endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ efflux following insulin withdrawal (27.Chung K.M. Jeong E.J. Park H. An H.K. Yu S.W. Mediation of autophagic cell death by type 3 ryanodine receptor (RyR3) in adult hippocampal neural stem cells.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2016; 10: 116-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggest that insulin withdrawal activated AMPK through Ca2+–CaMKK pathway rather than ATP depletion in HCN cells. If AMPK is critical for ACD in I(−) HCN cells, its forced activation may enhance the effects of insulin withdrawal and boost ACD. To test this assumption, we generated an AMPK construct encoding the constitutively active (CA) mutant form of the α2 subunit by introducing a point mutation of Thr-172 to Asp in combination with the deletion of C-terminal amino acid residues 313–548 containing the autoinhibitory sequence and the binding sites to the regulatory β/γ subunits (41.Crute B.E. Seefeld K. Gamble J. Kemp B.E. Witters L.A. Functional domains of the α1 catalytic subunit of the AMP-activated protein kinase.J. Biol.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6704-6711Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Persistent activation of AMPK was confirmed by phosphorylation of its well known substrate, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) (supplemental Fig. S2D). As expected, constitutive activation of AMPK in I(−) HCN cells led to a more marked increase in LC3-II and decrease in p62 levels than insulin withdrawal alone but did not activate caspase-3 (Fig. 2, A and B). AMPK α2-CA also induced a higher level of cell death than insulin withdrawal (Fig. 2C). In line with the ineffectiveness of Z-VAD against insulin withdrawal-induced ACD (19.Ha S. Ryu H.Y. Chung K.M. Baek S.-H. Kim E.-K. Yu S.-W. Regulation of autophagic cell death by glycogen synthase kinase-3β in adult hippocampal neural stem cells following insulin withdrawal.Mol.

Autophagic flux, as assessed by Western blotting of LC3-II in combination with bafilomycin A1 (BafA1), was further increased by the expression of AMPK α2-CA in I(−) HCN cells (Fig. 2, D and E). Lentiviral transduction with tandem labeled monomeric mRFP-GFP-LC3 also indicated a higher level of autophagic flux in I(−) HCN cells co-expressing AMPK α2-CA than I(−) HCN cells alone (Fig. 2, F and G). The quenching of the GFP fluorescence but not mRFP fluorescence at the acidic pH yields red puncta upon fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes (43.Kimura S. Noda T. Yoshimori T.

https://openalex.org/W2725540830,"In eukaryotes, precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA) splicing removes non-coding intron sequences to produce mature mRNA. This removal is controlled in part by RNA-binding proteins that regulate alternative splicing decisions through interactions with the splicing machinery. RNA binding motif protein 25 (RBM25) is a putative splicing factor strongly conserved across eukaryotic lineages. However, the role of RBM25 in global splicing regulation and its cellular functions are unknown. Here we show that RBM25 is required for the viability of multiple human cell lines, suggesting that it could play a key role in pre-mRNA splicing. Indeed, transcriptome-wide analysis of splicing events demonstrated that RBM25 regulates a large fraction of alternatively spliced exons throughout the human genome. Moreover, proteomic analysis indicated that RBM25 interacts with components of the early spliceosome and regulators of alternative splicing. Previously, we identified an RBM25 species that is mono-methylated at lysine 77 (RBM25K77me1), and here we used quantitative mass spectrometry to show that RBM25K77me1 is abundant in multiple human cell lines. We also identified a region of RBM25 spanning Lys-77 that binds with high affinity to serine- and arginine-rich splicing factor 2 (SRSF2), a crucial protein in exon definition, but only when Lys-77 is unmethylated. Together, our findings uncover a pivotal role for RBM25 as an essential regulator of alternative splicing and reveal a new potential mechanism for regulation of pre-mRNA splicing by lysine methylation of a splicing factor."

Mean age was 69.2 years (age range from 18 to 101 years old), and 60.3% of patients were women. The mean LP measurements were 5.54±0.32 mm for white, 5.38±0.32 mm for Asian, 5.32±0.30 mm for Hispanic, and 5.40±0.28 mm for African-American participants. After adjusting for age, sex, and AL, significant differences were found when comparing LP in paired comparisons among White cohort with Asians (P<0.001), Hispanics (P<0.001) and African-Americans (P = 0.003). Additionally, when comparing RLP, similar significant results were found when comparing Whites with Asians (P<0.001), Hispanics (P<0.001) and African-Americans (P = 0.002). Lastly, pair-wise comparison of LT between ethnic groups showed significant differences while comparing Asians with Whites (P = 0.001) and Asians with African-Americans (P<0.001).The results of this study suggest that the LP of Hispanic, Asian, and African-American patients are significantly smaller than that of White patients, and among all ethnic groups, Hispanics and after Asians have the smallest LP (P<0.001) and RLP (P<0.001). These findings may have implications for the relative risk of angle closure and the potential IOP response after cataract surgery among different ethnic groups."

Our previous work demonstrated the ability of glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) to metabolize neurotoxic glutamate in the stroke-affected brain. Here, we seek to identify small-molecule inducers of GOT expression to mitigate ischemic stroke injury. From a panel of phytoestrogen isoflavones, biochanin A (BCA) was identified as the most potent inducer of GOT gene expression in neural cells. BCA significantly increased GOT mRNA and protein expression at 24 h and protected against glutamate-induced cell death. Of note, this protection was lost when GOT was knocked down. To validate outcomes in vivo, C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally injected with BCA (5 and 10 mg/kg) for 4 wk and subjected to ischemic stroke. BCA levels were significantly increased in plasma and brain of mice. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated increased GOT protein expression in the brain. BCA attenuated stroke lesion volume as measured by 9.4T MRI and improved sensorimotor function—this protection was lost with GOT knockdown. BCA increased luciferase activity in cells that were transfected with the pERRE3tk-LUC plasmid, which demonstrated transactivation of GOT. This increase was lost when estrogen-related receptor response element sites were mutated. Taken together, BCA represents a natural phytoestrogen that mitigates stroke-induced injury by inducing GOT expression.—Khanna, S., Stewart, R., Gnyawali, S., Harris, H., Balch, M., Spieldenner, J., Sen, C.

Production of active Wnt depends on attachment of palmitoleate, a monounsaturated fatty acid, to a conserved serine by the acyltransferase Porcupine (PORCN). Studies of PORCN activity relied on cell-based fatty acylation and signaling assays as no direct enzyme assay had yet been developed. Here, we present the first in vitro assay that accurately recapitulates PORCN-mediated fatty acylation of a Wnt substrate. The critical feature is the use of a double disulfide-bonded Wnt peptide that mimics the two-dimensional structure surrounding the Wnt acylation site. PORCN-mediated Wnt acylation was abolished when the Wnt peptide was treated with DTT, and did not occur with a linear (non-disulfide-bonded) peptide, or when the double disulfide-bonded Wnt peptide contained Ala substituted for the Ser acylation site. We exploited this in vitro Wnt acylation assay to provide direct evidence that the small molecule LGK974, which is in clinical trials for managing Wnt-driven tumors, is a bona fide PORCN inhibitor whose IC50 for inhibition of Wnt fatty acylation in vitro closely matches that for inhibition of Wnt signaling. Side-by-side comparison of PORCN and Hedgehog acyltransferase (HHAT), two enzymes that attach 16-carbon fatty acids to secreted proteins, revealed that neither enzyme will accept the other's fatty acyl-CoA or peptide substrates.

Studies of Wnt fatty acylation in cell-based labeling assays revealed that lipid modification of Wnt proteins occurs in two steps. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase first converts palmitoyl-CoA into palmitoleoyl-CoA, which is then utilized as a substrate by the Wnt acyltransferase Porcupine (PORCN) 2The abbreviations used are: PORCN, Porcupine; HHAT, Hedgehog acyltransferase; GOAT, ghrelin O-acyltransferase; MBOAT, membrane-bound O-acyl transferase; Shh, Sonic Hedgehog; IC15, iodo-pentadecenoic acid; IC16, iodo-hexadecanoate; FDH, focal dermal hypoplasia. 2The abbreviations used are: PORCN, Porcupine; HHAT, Hedgehog acyltransferase; GOAT, ghrelin O-acyltransferase; MBOAT, membrane-bound O-acyl transferase; Shh, Sonic Hedgehog; IC15, iodo-pentadecenoic acid; IC16, iodo-hexadecanoate; FDH, focal dermal hypoplasia.

To date, structural information on PORCN is lacking and Wnt acylation has not been reconstituted in an enzymatic assay in vitro. PORCN is a member of the membrane-bound O-acyl transferase (MBOAT) family of multipass membrane proteins that catalyze fatty acylation of lipid or protein substrates (8.Shindou H. Eto M. Morimoto R. Shimizu T. Identification of membrane O-acyltransferase family motifs.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 383: 320-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Three members of the MBOAT family transfer fatty acids to secreted proteins: HHAT, the palmitoyl acyltransferase for Hedgehog proteins; GOAT, which transfers octanoate to ghrelin; and PORCN (9.Resh M.D. Fatty acylation of proteins: the long and the short of it.Prog. Lipid Res. 2016; 63: 120-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Each of these fatty acylated proteins contributes to disease states in humans. Because fatty acylation is essential for disease-causing activity, HHAT, GOAT, and PORCN have gained attention as drug targets. Peptide-based fatty acylation assays have led to the development of enzyme inhibitors for HHAT and GOAT (10.Barnett B.P. Hwang Y. Taylor M.S. Kirchner H. Pfluger P.T. Bernard V. Lin Y.Y. Bowers E.M.

Using cell-based Wnt signaling assays, small molecule inhibitors of PORCN have been identified, one of which (LGK974) has progressed to a clinical trial for treatment of Wnt-driven solid tumors (12.Chen B. Dodge M.E. Tang W. Lu J. Ma Z. Fan C.W. Wei S. Hao W. Kilgore J. Williams N.S. Roth M.G. Amatruda J.F. Chen C. Lum L.

However, in the absence of an in vitro assay, the ability of LGK974 to directly inhibit PORCN-mediated Wnt acylation has never been demonstrated. Development of an enzymatic assay for PORCN would shed light on how this enzyme recognizes its substrates and therefore would considerably enhance our knowledge of PORCN-mediated catalysis. We first sought to develop an in vitro assay to directly monitor fatty acylation of Wnt by PORCN. The principle of the assay was based on conditions successfully established for Shh palmitoylation by HHAT (14.Buglino J.A. Resh M.D. Hhat is a palmitoyl acyltransferase with specificity for N-palmitoylation of sonic hedgehog.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 22076-22088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), with a reaction mix consisting of a biotinylated peptide containing residues surrounding the fatty acylation site, microsomal membranes from cells expressing the acyltransferase, and a fatty acyl-CoA substrate. A Wnt peptide was synthesized containing sequences surrounding the Ser209 acylation site of Wnt3a, appended with C-terminal PEG–biotin. This sequence includes the conserved residues required for PORCN-mediated Wnt3a acylation identified in a cell-based acylation assay using [125I]IC15:1 ([125I]iodo-pentadecenoic acid), a radioiodinated palmitoleate analog (15.Rios-Esteves J. Haugen B. Resh M.D. Identification of key residues and regions important for Porcupine-mediated Wnt acylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 17009-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The presence of the iodide, which is sterically similar to a methyl group, makes the 15-carbon analog behave as a 16-carbon fatty acid. We have previously shown that [125I]IC15:1 is an authentic substrate for PORCN that mimics incorporation of the 16:1 fatty acid into Wnt3a in cells (15.Rios-Esteves J. Haugen B. Resh M.D. Identification of key residues and regions important for Porcupine-mediated Wnt acylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 17009-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Membranes from PORCN-expressing cells were incubated with the Wnt peptide and [125I]IC15:1 CoA, and biotinylated Wnt peptide was captured on streptavidin–agarose beads. However, no increased radiolabel incorporation into the Wnt peptide incubated with membranes from cells expressing wild-type PORCN was detected when compared with membranes from cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that recognition of the serine acylation site, located internally within Wnt, might be different from Shh, where acylation occurs at the N-terminal cysteine. In the three-dimensional crystal structure of Xenopus Wnt8, the acylated serine is located at the base of a loop whose structure is constrained by two sets of disulfide-bonded cysteines (4.Janda C.Y. Waghray D. Levin A.M. Thomas C. Garcia K.C. Structural basis of Wnt recognition by Frizzled.Science. 2012; 337: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). We therefore designed a peptide containing amino acids 199–219 of Wnt3a with disulfide bonds between Cys203–Cys217 and Cys205–Cys212, and appended with a C-terminal PEG–biotin (WT Wnt (S-S)) (Fig. 1B). As a negative control, a second peptide was synthesized with Ala in place of Ser at the equivalent of position 209. Both peptides were >95% pure based on HPLC analysis. Given the presence of four cysteines, there are three possible arrangements of the two disulfide bonds: Cys203–Cys217 and Cys205–Cys212; Cys203–Cys205 and Cys212–Cys217; and Cys203–Cys212 and Cys205–Cys217 (Fig. 1B). To verify that the disulfide bonds were present in the correct positions, the peptides were digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC–MS on an Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometer. The measured monoisotopic mass of the intact peptide was within 10 ppm of the theoretical mass, and the measured monoisotopic mass of the tryptic peptides matches within 10 ppm of the theoretical monoisotopic mass (Fig. 1C). Thus, the correct disposition of the two sets of disulfide-bonded cysteines was experimentally verified. Incubation of the disulfide-bonded peptide WT Wnt (S-S) with [125I]IC15:1 CoA and membranes from cells expressing wild-type PORCN resulted in a 5-fold increase of radiolabel incorporation when compared with the signal obtained with membranes from cells transfected with empty vector (Fig. 1A). No radiolabel incorporation above background was obtained when the disulfide-bonded peptide lacking the acylation site (S209A WNT) was used as a substrate. Moreover, the acylation signal was vastly reduced with membranes containing H341A PORCN, a putative active site PORCN mutant. The WT Wnt (S-S) acylation reaction was time-dependent (Fig. 1D) and salt-sensitive (Fig. 1E). No radiolabel incorporation into WT WNT was observed when free fatty acid, [125I]IC15:1, was used instead of [125I]IC15:1 CoA (Fig. 1F). We next tested the importance of disulfide-bonded cysteines in the peptide substrate. Pretreatment of WT WNT (S-S) peptide with DTT, prior to the addition of the other reaction components, reduced the signal to background levels (Fig. 1G). This loss of activity was not due to an effect of DTT on PORCN, because pretreatment of PORCN-containing membranes with DTT, followed by membrane re-isolation, had no effect on Wnt peptide acylation (Fig. 1G). Taken together, these data strongly suggest that PORCN-mediated Wnt fatty acylation can be accurately recapitulated in vitro and that the reaction is dependent on the presence of disulfide-bonded cysteines surrounding the Wnt acylation site. Mutations in the PORCN gene cause focal dermal hypoplasia, an X-linked disorder characterized by multiple congenital abnormalities (16.Wang X. Reid Sutton V. Omar Peraza-Llanes J. Yu Z. Rosetta R. Kou Y.C. Eble T.N. Patel A. Thaller C. Fang P. Van den Veyver I.B. Mutations in X-linked PORCN, a putative regulator of Wnt signaling, cause focal dermal hypoplasia.Nat. Genet. 2007; 39: 836-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Several of the reported FDH-associated missense mutations in human PORCN have been analyzed using a cell-based Wnt acylation assay, and have been shown to exhibit decreased acylation activity as well as decreased protein stability (15.Rios-Esteves J. Haugen B. Resh M.D. Identification of key residues and regions important for Porcupine-mediated Wnt acylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 17009-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To test whether enzymatic activity of PORCN is directly affected by these FDH mutations, we analyzed Wnt peptide acylation in vitro using membranes from cells expressing wild-type or mutant PORCN. The effects on PORCN-mediated Wnt acylation activity in vitro mirrored those obtained with the cell-based Wnt acylation assay: R228C PORCN exhibited activity nearly identical to WT PORCN, whereas the other mutants were compromised (Fig. 2A). Wnt signaling plays a key role in multiple tumor types, especially breast and colon cancer (17.Zhan T. Rindtorff N. Boutros M. Wnt signaling in cancer.Oncogene. 2017; 36: 1461-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Given that Wnt acylation is essential for signaling activity, inhibitors of PORCN have the potential to serve as chemotherapeutics in Wnt-driven cancers. High-throughput screening was used to identify GNF-1331, a small molecule that inhibits Wnt secretion in cell-based assays of Wnt signaling and also binds to PORCN-containing membranes (13.Liu J. Pan S. Hsieh M.H. Ng N. Sun F. Wang T. Kasibhatla S. Schuller A.G. Li A.G. Cheng D. Li J. Tompkins C. Pferdekamper A. Steffy A. Cheng J. et al.Targeting Wnt-driven cancer through the inhibition of Porcupine by LGK974.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 20224-20229Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Pharmacologic optimization of GNF-1331 resulted in the generation of LGK974, which displaces radiolabeled GNF-1331 from PORCN-containing membranes (IC50 = 1 nm) and inhibits Wnt signaling in a co-culture assay (IC50 = 0.4 nm) (13.Liu J. Pan S. Hsieh M.H. Ng N. Sun F. Wang T. Kasibhatla S. Schuller A.G. Li A.G. Cheng D. Li J. Tompkins C. Pferdekamper A. Steffy A. Cheng J. et al.Targeting Wnt-driven cancer through the inhibition of Porcupine by LGK974.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 20224-20229Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). LGK974 has therefore been designated a PORCN inhibitor and is currently in Phase I clinical trials. To date, however, LGK974 has never been tested for its ability to directly inhibit the enzymatic activity of PORCN. Using our in vitro assay, dose-dependent inhibition of Wnt peptide acylation by LGK974 occurred with an IC50 = 12.9 nm, which closely mirrors the IC50 = 7.5 nm obtained for LGK974 in a luciferase-based reporter assay of Wnt signaling (Fig. 2, B and C). PORCN and HHAT both catalyze attachment of 16-carbon fatty acids (palmitoleate or palmitate, respectively) to secreted signaling proteins, and both enzymes are members of the MBOAT family. We previously showed that the small molecule HHAT inhibitor RU-SKI 43 had no effect on PORCN-mediated incorporation of [125I]IC15:1 into Wnt3a in a cell-based acylation assay (11.Petrova E. Rios-Esteves J. Ouerfelli O. Glickman J.F. Resh M.D. Inhibitors of Hedgehog acyltransferase block Sonic Hedgehog signaling.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A similar result was obtained using in vitro acylation assays: RU-SKI 43 inhibited [125I]IC16 ([125I]iodo-hexadecanoate) incorporation into Shh peptide, but had no effect on Wnt (S-S) peptide acylation with [125I]IC15:1 (Fig. 3A). To directly compare the substrate specificities of the two enzymes side by side, we analyzed the ability of each enzyme to recognize each other's fatty acid and protein substrates using in vitro peptide-based acylation reaction assays. PORCN selectively utilized [125I]IC15:1 CoA, but not [125I]IC16:0 CoA, as a substrate to acylate Wnt (S-S), and no reactivity toward a Shh peptide was detected (Fig. 3B). Conversely, HHAT selectively palmitoylated the Shh peptide with [125I]IC16:0 CoA, but not [125I]IC15:1 CoA, and no reactivity toward Wnt (S-S) was observed (Fig. 3B). In a competition assay, the addition of excess non-radioactive palmitoleoyl-CoA (16:1) inhibited PORCN-mediated incorporation of [125I]IC15:1 into Wnt (S-S) (Fig. 3C). Myristoyl-CoA (14:0), palmitoyl-CoA (16:0), and oleoyl-CoA (18:1) had no effect. These data clearly illustrate the selectivity of each enzyme with regard to fatty acid and protein substrates, and suggest that PORCN and HHAT are dedicated acyltransferases for Wnt and Shh (Hedgehog) proteins, respectively. One of the molecular hallmarks of Wnt proteins is the presence of 22–24 conserved cysteine residues within all Wnt family members. The four cysteines located immediately upstream and downstream of Wnt3a Ser209 (Cys203, Cys205, Cys212, and Cys217) had been previously been demonstrated to be required for fatty acylation and signaling by Wnt3a (15.Rios-Esteves J.

Chem. 2014; 289: 17009-17019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18.MacDonald B.T. Hien A. Zhang X. Iranloye O. Virshup D.M. Waterman M.L. He X. Disulfide bond requirements for active Wnt ligands.J. Biol. Chem. 2014; 289: 18122-18136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Moreover, GFP fusions containing 21- and 31-amino acid sequences from Wnt1 that include the four cysteines incorporate alkyne-labeled palmitate in cell-based acylation assays, whereas an 11-amino acid sequence that lacks the outer cysteine pair does not (19.Miranda M. Galli L.M. Enriquez M. Szabo L.A. Gao X. Hannoush R.N. Burrus L.W. Identification of the WNT1 residues required for palmitoylation by Porcupine.FEBS Lett. 2014; 588: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Using synthetic peptides that encompass the sequence surrounding the Ser acylation site, we show that the mere presence of Cys residues in a Wnt substrate is not sufficient, and that disulfide bonding of Cys residues is critical for PORCN-mediated acylation. It is likely that this unique two-dimensional structure places constraints on the orientation of Ser209 so that it can be correctly presented for binding to and acylation by PORCN. The double disulfide-bonded Wnt peptides were extremely technically challenging to synthesize, and as a result, production was time- and labor-intensive and costly. Nonetheless, the 21-residue WT Wnt (S-S) peptide represents a minimal length PORCN substrate for in vitro assays. Further refinement of the geometric requirements within the Wnt peptide substrate could be directed toward replacement of native disulfides with synthetic bridges or disulfide bond mimetics or the use of cyclized peptides. LGK974 is currently in clinical trials for safety and efficacy in treating Wnt-driven tumors. Although it is marketed as a PORCN inhibitor, the ability of LGK974 to directly inhibit PORCN-mediated Wnt acylation has never been tested. Thus, it remained formally possible that inhibition of Wnt secretion and signaling that occurred with LGK974 treatment in cells could be due to an effect on one or more of the multiple steps required to produce active Wnt ligand, e.g. inhibition of stearoyl-CoA desaturase or binding to Wntless. Here, we exploit the in vitro Wnt acylation assay to provide the first direct evidence that LGK974 is a bona fide PORCN inhibitor whose IC50 for inhibition of Wnt fatty acylation closely matches that for inhibition of Wnt signaling. Future mechanistic studies can now be carried out to determine how LGK974 inhibits PORCN-mediated catalysis. Understanding the molecular basis for enzyme–substrate recognition and selectivity remains one of the major challenges for MBOAT proteins in general, and PORCN and HHAT in particular (20.Tuladhar R. Lum L. Fatty acyl donor selectivity in membrane bound O-acyltransferases and communal cell fate decision-making.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2015; 43: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The development of an in vitro Wnt acylation assay now makes it possible to directly compare, side by side, two MBOAT enzymes that both catalyze attachment of 16-carbon fatty acids to secreted proteins. Neither enzyme will accept the other's fatty acyl-CoA or protein (peptide) substrates. These biochemical features explain why targeted disruption of PORCN is not genetically rescued by HHAT, and vice versa. A two-dimensional transmembrane topology map for HHAT reveals the presence of 10 transmembrane domains and 2 reentrant loops (21.Matevossian A. Resh M.D. Membrane topology of hedgehog acyltransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290: 2235-2243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22.Konitsiotis A.D. Jovanović B.

Chem. 2015; 290: 3293-3307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Although a similar topological analysis of PORCN is not yet available, it is likely to be equally complex. The next step toward understanding how these multipass membrane proteins function will likely require three-dimensional structural information.

Porcn point mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Super TOP/FOP and pRL-TK plasmids were a kind gift from Dr. Anthony M. C. Brown (Weill Cornell Medical College, New York, NY). HEK 293FT cells (Invitrogen) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 500 μg/ml Geneticin, 1 mm GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids. Cells were transfected with 6 μg of Porcn cDNA using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), split 1:2 the following day, and then grown for 24 h. P100 membranes were prepared from hypotonically lysed cells, following centrifugation at 100,000 × g (P100) as described (14.Buglino J.A.

Linear Wnt3a WT (CKCHGLSGSCEFKTCW; calculated mass 2168.979, observed mass 2169.043) and Wnt3a S209A (CKCHGLAGSCEVKTCW; calculated mass 2152.984, observed mass 2153.248) peptides with C-terminal PEG–biotin were synthesized by the Microchemistry Core Lab of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. C-terminal biotinylated (Biotin–PEG NovaTagTM), disulfide-bonded Wnt3a WT (MHL KC(S-)K C(S-)HG LSG SC(S-)E VKT C(S-)WW) (calculated monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 2860.3052, observed monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 2860.2943), and C-terminal biotinylated (Biotin–PEG NovaTagTM), disulfide-bonded Wnt3a S209A (MHL KC(S-)K C(S-)HG LAG SC(S-)E VKT C(S-)WW) (calculated monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 2844.3103, observed monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 2844.2959) peptides were synthesized by AnaSpec (Fremont, CA), and then analyzed by HPLC to assess purity to be greater than 95% pure. To confirm the identity and location of the disulfide bonds, a 1-μl aliquot was diluted in 25 μl of 100 mm ammonium bicarbonate and subsequently digested with trypsin at a 1:100 enzyme-to-substrate ratio at 37 °C for 4 h. The trypsin-digested peptides as well as undigested peptides were further diluted 1:50 with 0.1% formic acid. 2-μl aliquots were characterized by high-resolution LC–MS on an Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL) coupled with a Waters nanoACQUITY LC via a Proxeon2 nano-electrospray ionization source. Peptides were eluted from a nano-C18 reverse-phase column with a 1–50% binary gradient, 0.1% formic acid (Buffer A) and acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid (Buffer B), over 90 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. MS1 data from m/z 380–2000 were acquired in profile mode at 60,000 resolution. The C-terminal biotinylated (Biotin–PEG NovaTagTM), disulfide-bonded Wnt3a WT peptide mass spectra showed signals for the +3, +4, and +5 charge state with the +4 charge state and observed monoisotopic mass shown (Fig. 1C). As seen in Fig. 1B, there are three possible arrangements of the two disulfide bonds: Cys203–Cys217 and Cys205–Cys212; Cys203–Cys205 and Cys212–Cys217; and Cys203–Cys212 and Cys205–Cys217. We took advantage of the lysine residues within the peptide sequence and the location of the disulfide bonds to experimentally confirm the proper orientation of the disulfide bonds. After trypsin digestion, two distinct products will be generated for the desired Cys203–Cys217 (calculated monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 1117.4703) and Cys205–Cys212 (calculated monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 1270.5697) linked peptide. The alternate arrangements result in two peptides: one of 528.2936 and one of 2389.0634 (calculated monoisotopic mass). Upon 4 h of trypsin digestion, we observed the disappearance of the substrate and the generation of two peptides, (M+2H)2+ ions at m/z = 559.2391 and (M+2H)2+ ions at m/z = 635.7888 corresponding to the measured monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 1117.4763 and (M+H)+1 = 1270.5780, respectively (Fig. 1C), both within 10 ppm of the calculated monoisotopic mass. Identical data were acquired for the C-terminal biotinylated (Biotin–PEG NovaTagTM), disulfide-bonded Wnt3a S209A (intact peptide calculated monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 2844.3103, observed monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 2844.2959), trypsin-generated cleavage calculated monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 1101.4814, measured monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 1101.4737, and calculated monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 1270.5780, measured monoisotopic mass (M+H)+1 = 1270.5683. 10 μg of P100 membranes harvested from Porcupine-expressing HEK 293FT cells were incubated with 100 μm Wnt peptide and 30 μl of reaction buffer (167 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.083% Triton X-100, 167 μm [125I]IC15:1 CoA) for 1 h at 37 °C. For Shh assays, 10 μg of P100 membranes harvested from HHAT-expressing HEK 293FT cells were incubated with 100 μm Shh peptide, 167 μm [125I]IC16 CoA, and 30 μl of reaction buffer for 1 h at room temperature (14.Buglino J.A.

After incubation, 400 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer and 50 μl of streptavidin–agarose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with continuous mixing. Biotinylated peptides were pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min. Pellets were washed three times with 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. [125I]IC15:1 or [125I]IC16 incorporation was measured in a PerkinElmer γ counter. To measure paracrine Wnt signaling activity, HEK293FT cells were transfected with 3 μg of Super TopFlash or Super FOP and 0.3 μg of pRL-TK, and 24 h after transfection, cells were co-cultured in 12-well plates with L-Wnt3a cells transfected with 6 μg of Porcn at a 3:1 ratio (L-Wnt3a:293FT) in the presence of the indicated drugs for 24 h.

Corneal epithelial integrity was defective and the thickness was reduced in the early postnatal stage of Eda mutant Tabby mice. Corneal epithelial cell proliferation decreased and the epithelial wound healing was delayed in Tabby mice, whereas it was restored by exogenous Eda. Eda exposure promoted mouse corneal epithelial wound healing during organ culture, whereas scratch wound assay showed that it did not affect human corneal epithelial cell line migration. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphorylated EGFR (p-EGFR), and phosphorylated ERK1/2 (p-ERK) were down-regulated in Tabby mice corneal epithelium. Eda treatment up-regulated the expression of Ki67, EGFR, p-EGFR, and p-ERK in human corneal epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, Eda protein can be secreted from meibomian glands and promotes corneal epithelial cell proliferation through regulation of the EGFR signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2728540442,"Urinary mRNA analysis with three-gene set (18S rRNA, CD3ε, and IP-10) has been suggested as a non-invasive biomarker of acute rejection (AR) in kidney transplant recipients using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Application of droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), which has been suggested to provide higher sensitivity, accuracy, and absolute quantification without standard curves, could be a useful method for the quantifying low concentration of urinary mRNA. We investigated the urinary expression of these three genes in Korean patients with kidney transplantation and also evaluated the usefulness of ddPCR. 90 urine samples were collected at time of allograft biopsy in kidney recipients (n = 67) and from patients with stable renal function more than 10 years (n = 23). Absolute quantification with both PCR system showed significant higher mRNA levels of CD3ε and IP-10 in AR patients compared with stable transplants (STA), but there was no difference in 18S rRNA expression across the patient groups. To evaluate discrimination between AR and STA, ROC curve analyses of CTOT-4 formula yielded area under the curve values of 0.72 (95% CI 0.60–0.83) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.66–0.88) for qPCR and ddPCR, respectively. However, 18S normalization of absolute quantification and relative quantification with 18S showed better discrimination of AR from STA than those of the absolute method. Our data indicate that ddPCR system without standard curve would be useful to determine the absolute quantification of urinary mRNA from kidney transplant recipients. However, comparative method also could be useful and convenient in both qPCR and ddPCR analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2728374022,"The visual photo-transduction cascade is a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling system, in which light-activated rhodopsin (Rho*) is the GPCR catalyzing the exchange of GDP for GTP on the heterotrimeric G protein transducin (GT). This results in the dissociation of GT into its component αT-GTP and β1γ1 subunit complex. Structural information for the Rho*-GT complex will be essential for understanding the molecular mechanism of visual photo-transduction. Moreover, it will shed light on how GPCRs selectively couple to and activate their G protein signaling partners. Here, we report on the preparation of a stable detergent-solubilized complex between Rho* and a heterotrimer (GT*) comprising a GαT/Gαi1 chimera (αT*) and β1γ1 The complex was formed on native rod outer segment membranes upon light activation, solubilized in lauryl maltose neopentyl glycol, and purified with a combination of affinity and size-exclusion chromatography. We found that the complex is fully functional and that the stoichiometry of Rho* to GαT* is 1:1. The molecular weight of the complex was calculated from small-angle X-ray scattering data and was in good agreement with a model consisting of one Rho* and one GT*. The complex was visualized by negative-stain electron microscopy, which revealed an architecture similar to that of the β2-adrenergic receptor-GS complex, including a flexible αT* helical domain. The stability and high yield of the purified complex should allow for further efforts toward obtaining a high-resolution structure of this important signaling complex."
https://openalex.org/W2728448060,"Characterization of the second nucleotide-binding domain (NBD2) of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) has lagged behind research into the NBD1 domain, in part because NBD1 contains the F508del mutation, which is the dominant cause of cystic fibrosis. Research on NBD2 has also been hampered by the overall instability of the domain and the difficulty of producing reagents. Nonetheless, multiple disease-causing mutations reside in NBD2, and the domain is critical for CFTR function, because channel gating involves NBD1/NBD2 dimerization, and NBD2 contains the catalytically active ATPase site in CFTR. Recognizing the paucity of structural and biophysical data on NBD2, here we have defined a bioinformatics-based method for manually identifying stabilizing substitutions in NBD2, and we used an iterative process of screening single substitutions against thermal melting points to both produce minimally mutated stable constructs and individually characterize mutations. We present a range of stable constructs with minimal mutations to help inform further research on NBD2. We have used this stabilized background to study the effects of NBD2 mutations identified in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, demonstrating that mutants such as N1303K and G1349D are characterized by lower stability, as shown previously for some NBD1 mutations, suggesting a potential role for NBD2 instability in the pathology of CF.

https://openalex.org/W2728051474,"The interconnected PI3K and MAPK signaling pathways are commonly perturbed in cancer. Dual inhibition of these pathways by the small-molecule PI3K inhibitor pictilisib (GDC-0941) and the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib (GDC-0973) suppresses cell proliferation and induces cell death better than either single agent in several preclinical models. Using mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, we have identified the RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF157 as a target at the intersection of PI3K and MAPK signaling. We demonstrate that RNF157 phosphorylation downstream of the PI3K and MAPK pathways influences the ubiquitination and stability of RNF157 during the cell cycle in an anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome-CDH1-dependent manner. Deletion of these phosphorylation-targeted residues on RNF157 disrupts binding to CDH1 and protects RNF157 from ubiquitination and degradation. Expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), itself a downstream target of PI3K/MAPK signaling, leads to increased phosphorylation of RNF157 on the same residues modulated by PI3K and MAPK signaling. Inhibition of PI3K and MEK in combination or of CDK2 by their respective small-molecule inhibitors reduces RNF157 phosphorylation at these residues and attenuates RNF157 interaction with CDH1 and its subsequent degradation. Knockdown of endogenous RNF157 in melanoma cells leads to late S phase and G2/M arrest and induces apoptosis, the latter further potentiated by concurrent PI3K/MEK inhibition, consistent with a role for RNF157 in the cell cycle. We propose that RNF157 serves as a novel node integrating oncogenic signaling pathways with the cell cycle machinery and promoting optimal cell cycle progression in transformed cells."
https://openalex.org/W2732034476,"Brucellosis caused by Brucella abortus is an important zoonosis that constitutes a serious hazard to public health. Prevention of human brucellosis depends on the control of the disease in animals. Livestock movement data represent a valuable source of information to understand the pattern of contacts between holdings, which may determine the inter-herds and intra-herd spread of the disease. The manuscript addresses the use of computational epidemic models rooted in the knowledge of cattle trade network to assess the probabilities of brucellosis spread and to design control strategies. Three different spread network-based models were proposed: the DFC (Disease Flow Centrality) model based only on temporal cattle network structure and unrelated to the epidemiological disease parameters; a deterministic SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) model; a stochastic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model in which epidemiological and demographic within-farm aspects were also modelled. Containment strategies based on farms centrality in the cattle network were tested and discussed. All three models started from the identification of the entire sub-network originated from an infected farm, up to the fifth order of contacts. Their performances were based on data collected in Sicily in the framework of the national eradication plan of brucellosis in 2009. Results show that the proposed methods improves the efficacy and efficiency of the tracing activities in comparison to the procedure currently adopted by the veterinary services in the brucellosis control, in Italy. An overall assessment shows that the SIR model is the most suitable for the practical needs of the veterinary services, being the one with the highest sensitivity and the shortest computation time."
https://openalex.org/W2725377668,"Mitochondria translate the RNAs for 13 core polypeptides of respiratory chain and ATP synthase complexes that are essential for the assembly and function of these complexes. This process occurs in close proximity to the mitochondrial inner membrane. However, the mechanisms and molecular machinery involved in mitochondrial translation are not fully understood, and defects in this process can result in severe diseases. Stomatin-like protein (SLP)-2 is a mainly mitochondrial protein that forms cardiolipin- and prohibitin-enriched microdomains in the mitochondrial inner membrane that are important for the formation of respiratory supercomplexes and their function. Given this regulatory role of SLP-2 in processes closely associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane, we hypothesized that the function of SLP-2 would have an impact on mitochondrial translation. 35S-Methionine/cysteine pulse labeling of resting or activated T cells from T cell-specific Slp-2 knockout mice showed a significant impairment in the production of several mitochondrial DNA-encoded polypeptides following T cell activation, including Cytb, COXI, COXII, COXIII, and ATP6. Measurement of mitochondrial DNA stability and mitochondrial transcription revealed that this impairment was at the post-transcriptional level. Examination of mitochondrial ribosome assembly showed that SLP-2 migrated in sucrose-density gradients similarly to the large ribosomal subunit but that its deletion at the genetic level did not affect mitochondrial ribosome assembly. Functionally, the impairment in mitochondrial translation correlated with decreased interleukin-2 production in activated T cells. Altogether, these data show that SLP-2 acts as a general regulator of mitochondrial translation."

In the present study, neuropathic animal models were successfully constructed in rats by injecting 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg 2,5-HD intraperitoneally for 5 weeks. Rats exposed to 2,5-HD exhibited progressive gait abnormalities and slower motor neural response in a dose-dependent manner. TUNEL analysis and immunofluorescence dual labeling revealed that the spinal cord of the 2,5-HD treated rats underwent significantly more apoptosis in the cells of spinal cord than that of the control group. The neuron apoptosis index in spinal cord was 4.1%, 6.7%, 9.8% respectively in rats exposed to 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg 2,5-HD, compared with 1.1% in the control group (p < 0.05). Biochemical analysis showed that 2,5-HD exposure downregulated NGF expression in the spinal cord of the intoxicated rats; inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt and Bad, two key players in PI3K/Akt pathway downstream of NGF; increased the dimerization of Bad with Bcl-xL in the mitochondrial fraction, followed by the release of cytochrome c and activation of caspase-3 in the spinal cord of rats. In vitro study showed that the NGF expression decreased significantly in VSC4.1 cells dosed with 5.0, 10.0 mM 2,5-HD in comparison with the control group. It was also found that NGF supplement repressed the induced apoptosis, and increased p-Akt and p-Bad level in 2,5-HD treated VSC4.1 cells, which could be antagonized by PI3K kinase (the upstream member of Akt) inhibitor LY294002. Taken together, our experimental results indicate that 2,5-HD may induce apoptosis in the spinal cord of rats via downregulating NGF expression and subsequently repressing PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2732350501,"Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is responsible for maintaining systemic blood pressure, vascular remodeling and angiogenesis. Previous studies showed that bovine eNOS serine 1179 (Serine 1177 for human eNOS) phosphorylation enhanced NO synthesis. Meanwhile, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) plays a critical role in maintenance of eNOS structure and function. However, the regulatory difference and importance between Serine 1179 phosphorylation and Hsp90 on eNOS activity have not been evaluated. In current studies, S1179D eNOS was employed to mimic phospho-eNOS and exhibited markedly increased enzyme activity than wild type eNOS (WT eNOS). Hsp90 showed a dose-dependent increase for both WT eNOS and S1179D eNOS activity at the presence of all eNOS cofactors, such as Calcium/Calmodulin (Ca2+ /CaM), BH4, and NADPH etc. The enhancement effects were abolished by dominant-negative mutant Hsp 90 protein. ENOS-cofactors dynamic assay showed that Hsp90 enhanced WT eNOS affinity to NADPH, L-arginine, and CaM but not to Ca2+ and BH4. The impact of eNOS Serine 1179 phosphorylation and Hsp90 on eNOS affinity to cofactors has also been compared. Different from the effect of Hsp90 on eNOS affinity to specific cofactors, Serine 1179 phosphorylation significantly increased eNOS affinity to all cofactors. Moreover, VEGF-induced eNOS phosphorylation in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) and more NO generation from eNOS compared to control. Inhibition of Hsp90 by geldanamycin decreased eNOS activity and decreased endothelial viability. In conclusion, by changing eNOS structure, Hsp90 profoundly affected eNOS functions, including change of affinity of eNOS to cofactors like Ca2+, L-arginine, BH4 and further affecting NO generation capability. These specific cofactors regulated by Hsp 90 could become potential therapeutic targets of the eNOS-related diseases in future."
https://openalex.org/W2734123883,"Membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14) is a transmembrane collagenase highly expressed in metastatic ovarian cancer and correlates with poor survival. Accumulating evidence shows that the cytoplasmic tail of MT1-MMP is subjected to phosphorylation, and this post-translational modification regulates enzymatic activity at the cell surface. To investigate the potential role of MT1-MMP cytoplasmic residue Thr567 phosphorylation in regulation of metastasis-associated behaviors, ovarian cancer cells that express low endogenous levels of MT1-MMP were engineered to express wild-type MT1-MMP, a phosphomimetic mutant (T567E), or a phosphodeficient mutant (T567A). Results show that Thr567 modulation influences behavior of both individual cells and multicellular aggregates (MCAs). The acquisition of either wild-type or mutant MT1-MMP expression results in altered cohesion of epithelial sheets and the formation of more compact MCAs relative to parental cells. Cells expressing MT1-MMP-T567E phosphomimetic mutants exhibit enhanced cell migration. Furthermore, MCAs formed from MT1-MMP-T567E–expressing cells adhere avidly to both intact ex vivo peritoneal explants and three-dimensional collagen gels. Interaction of these MCAs with peritoneal mesothelium disrupts mesothelial integrity, exposing the submesothelial collagen matrix on which MT1-MMP-T567E MCAs rapidly disperse. Together, these findings suggest that post-translational regulation of the Thr567 in the MT1-MMP cytoplasmic tail may function as a regulatory mechanism to impact ovarian cancer metastatic success."

https://openalex.org/W2724599949,"The role for mechanical stimulation in the control of cell fate has been previously proposed, suggesting that there may be a role of mechanical conditioning in directing mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) towards specific lineage for tissue engineering applications. Although previous studies have reported that calcium signalling is involved in regulating many cellular processes in many cell types, its role in managing cellular responses to tensile loading (mechanotransduction) of MSCs has not been fully elucidated. In order to establish this, we disrupted calcium signalling by blocking stretch-activated calcium channel (SACC) in human MSCs (hMSCs) in vitro. Passaged-2 hMSCs were exposed to cyclic tensile loading (1 Hz + 8% for 6, 24, 48, and 72 hours) in the presence of the SACC blocker, gadolinium. Analyses include image observations of immunochemistry and immunofluorescence staining from extracellular matrix (ECM) production, and measuring related tenogenic and apoptosis gene marker expression. Uniaxial tensile loading increased the expression of tenogenic markers and ECM production. However, exposure to strain in the presence of 20 μM gadolinium reduced the induction of almost all tenogenic markers and ECM staining, suggesting that SACC acts as a mechanosensor in strain-induced hMSC tenogenic differentiation process. Although cell death was observed in prolonged stretching, it did not appear to be apoptosis mediated. In conclusion, the knowledge gained in this study by elucidating the role of calcium in MSC mechanotransduction processes, and that in prolonged stretching results in non-apoptosis mediated cell death may be potential useful for regenerative medicine applications."

https://openalex.org/W2726982482,"In 2015 the British government announced a number of major tax reforms for individual landlords. To give landlords time to adjust, some of these tax measures are being introduced gradually from April 2017, with full effect in tax year 2020/21. The changes in taxation have received much media attention since there has been widespread belief that the new measures were sufficiently skewed against landlords that they could signal the end of the Buy-To-Let (BTL) investment era in the UK. This paper assesses the prospective performance of BTL investments in London from the investor's perspective, and examines the impact of incoming tax reforms using a novel Temporal Bayesian Network model. The model captures uncertainties of interest by simulating the impact of changing circumstances and the interventions available to an investor at various time-steps of a BTL investment portfolio. The simulation results suggest that the new tax reforms are likely to have a detrimental effect on net profits from rental income, and this hits risk-seeking investors who favour leverage much harder than risk-averse investors who do not seek to expand their property portfolio. The impact on net profits also poses substantial risks for lossmaking returns excluding capital gains, especially in the case of rising interest rates. While this makes it less desirable or even non-viable for some to continue being a landlord, based on the current status of all factors taken into consideration for simulation, investment prospects are still likely to remain good within a reasonable range of interest rate and capital growth rate variations. The results also suggest that the recent trend of property prices in London increasing faster than rents will not continue for much longer; either capital growth rates will have to decrease, rental growth rates will have to increase, or we shall observe a combination of the two events."

This study investigated the effectiveness of a novel membrane utilizing surface water induction technology to prevent adhesions. Methods Eight beagles were divided into an experimental group (five males) and a control group (three females). The experimental group underwent thoracotomy on both the left and right sides of the chest. Both sides received the membrane, and the membrane on one side was glued to the pleura using tissue adhesive. The control group underwent thoracotomy only on the left side. Two weeks postoperatively, all dogs were sacrificed and adhesions were evaluated macroscopically and microscopically. Results Severe adhesion was seen between the parietal and visceral pleura in all control dogs, whereas the experimental group showed minor adhesion in only one dog on one side. Conclusions Our novel anti-adhesive membrane appeared highly effective in preventing postthoracotomy pleural adhesions."
