https://openalex.org/W2142526109,"We have isolated cDNA clones generated from the mRNA encoding the opsin apoprotein of bovine rhodopsin and used these cDNAs to isolate genomic DNA clones containing the complete opsin gene. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the cloned DNAs has yielded a complete amino acid sequence for bovine rhodopsin and provided an intron-exon map of its gene. The mRNA homologous sequences in the 6.4 kb gene consist of a 96 bp 5' untranslated region, a 1044 bp coding region, and a surprisingly long approximately 1400 bp 3' untranslated region, and are divided into five exons by four introns that interrupt the coding region. Secondary structure analysis predicts that the bovine rhodopsin chain, like that of bacteriorhodopsin, contains seven transmembrane segments. Interestingly, three of the four introns are immediately distal to the codons for three of these segments, and one of these introns marks the boundary between the C-terminal domain and a transmembrane domain."
https://openalex.org/W2007741978,"We have demonstrated, by DNA excess filter hybridizations to pulse-labeled cell RNA, that estrogen selectively stabilizes Xenopus liver vitellogenin mRNA against cytoplasmic degradation. The half-life of vitellogenin mRNA is approximately 3 weeks in the presence of estrogen and 16 hr after estrogen is withdrawn from the culture medium. Total poly(A) mRNA exhibits the same half-life (16 hr) in the presence or absence of estrogen. The rapid cytoplasmic degradation of vitellogenin mRNA in the absence of estrogen is fully reversible upon restimulation with estrogen, indicating that nuclear modification of vitellogenin RNA transcripts is not responsible for their stability. Intermediate levels of vitellogenin mRNA stability and changes in the relative rate of vitellogenin gene transcription are not observed late in estrogen induction, when vitellogenin mRNA levels plateau. Instead, Xenopus liver cells achieve fine control over the level of vitellogenin mRNA through down-regulation of the overall rate of total nuclear RNA synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1590925313,"The Ca2+-binding proteins, calsequestrin, calmodulin, troponin C, and S-100, have all been shown to stain dark blue or purple with the cationic carbocyanine dye Stains-all, while most proteins stain red or pink. Stains-all staining of these Ca2+-binding proteins was 50-100% more intense than Coomassie blue staining, and the blue stained calsequestrin and troponin C could be detected in muscle extracts. Densitometric scans of Stains-all-stained gels revealed that interaction of the dye with Ca2+-binding proteins changed the absorption spectrum of the dye. The dye-protein complex absorbed maximally at 615 nm, reflecting a state that results from the binding of individual dye molecules at anionic sites. Stains-all also interacted with undenatured Ca2+-binding proteins in aqueous solution forming a complex absorbing maximally at 600 nm. A simple assay for Ca2+-binding proteins has been developed using this property. These results suggest that the interaction of the dye with anionic sites within these Ca2+-binding proteins produces the dye-protein complex which absorbs at 600-615 nm. Stains-all staining of these Ca2+-binding proteins will be useful in their identification and purification from various tissues. It might also be a valuable tool in the identification of potential Ca2+-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1992045675,"A cDNA library was constructed from mRNA isolated from the brains of 18-day-old rats, the age at which myelin biosynthesis is maximal. A synthetic DNA probe synthesized based on reverse translation of the amino acid sequence of rat myelin basic protein (MBP) was used to select two cDNA clones encoding MBP. A 1.5 kb Eco RI fragment from one clone was completely sequenced. When translated, a portion of this sequence was identical at 126 of 127 positions with the reported amino acid sequence for small MBP from the rat. Brains from mice of the homozygous shiverer genotype contained neatly reduced amounts of MBP mRNA relative to wild type. A deletion of MBP sequences in the genome of shiverer mice was also demonstrated. cDNAs for MBP will allow molecular investigation of the role this gene plays in both dysmyelinating and demyelinating diseases, as well as questions of MBP biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2018255535,"Human mesothelial cells grew rapidly in culture when provided with serum, EGF, and hydrocortisone, adopting a fibroblastoid shape and forming parallel, multilayered arrays at saturation density. In the absence of EGF, the cells grew slowly to a flat, epithelioid monolayer similar to their normal pattern in vivo. Mesothelial cells normally have a high keratin and a low vimentin content in vivo. In culture, rapidly growing cells greatly reduced synthesis and content of their four major keratins to levels undetectable by immunofluorescence in most cells, but keratin synthesis and content returned to high levels whenever growth slowed. Vimentin synthesis and content was high during serial culture, but decreased several-fold in nondividing cells. The unique ability of the mesothelial cell to reversibly alter its morphology and intermediate filament composition is of unknown function and mechanism, but accounts for the morphological heterogeneity and the presence of keratin-negative cells in mesotheliomas."

https://openalex.org/W2045854985,"We have previously demonstrated that T lymphomas may express clonally specific epitopes that are carried by a T-cell-restricted, disulfide-bonded heterodimeric glycoprotein. We have used a monoclonal antibody, 124-40, to isolate the lymphoma-specific antigen and raise a xenoantiserum to the molecule. This antiserum immunoprecipitates a family of disulfide-bonded dimers from normal thymocytes and T cells, but is unreactive with B cells. Peptide maps prepared after limited proteolytic digestion indicate that the molecules from the different cell populations have homologous primary structures. Comparison of two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps indicate that, in addition to several common peptides, the molecules exhibit considerable structural heterogeneity. Taken together, these data indicate that the T-cell-specific heteroduplex has regions of constant and variable structure consistent with the properties expected for the T cell antigen receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1971537559,"Shark cartilage contains a substance that strongly inhibits the growth of new blood vessels toward solid tumors, thereby restricting tumor growth. The abundance of this factor in shark cartilage, in contrast to cartilage from mammalian sources, may make sharks an ideal source of the inhibitor and may help to explain the rarity of neoplasms in these animals."
https://openalex.org/W2055778129,"The Drosophila dopa decarboxylase gene, Ddc, functions normally when reintroduced into flies. DNA containing a cloned Ddc gene inserted into a P element transposon was injected into early embryos. Transformants were identified by suppression of the cuticular phenotype of a Ddc mutant allele. The reintegrated genes are expressed in the proper tissue and at the proper stages during development even though their positions within the genome are different from that of the wild-type Ddc gene. Absolute levels of DDC enzyme activity are within 35% of that found in wild-type Canton S flies, the source of the transforming DNA. The transformants' Ddc RNA is indistinguishable from that of wild type. One reintegrated Ddc gene, inserted on the X chromosome, is affected by the dosage compensation mechanism that leads to sex-specific differences in the expression of many X-chromosome genes."
https://openalex.org/W2115343151,"The Notch locus appears to correspond to a 37 kb transcription unit. Homologous poly(A)+ RNA is about 11.7 kb. Nine RNA coding regions have been detected and localized within the transcription unit by S1 nuclease analyses. These range in size from 130 to 7250 bp. Sequences within the 3' coding region are variably used. Twenty-four Notch locus ""point"" mutations have been examined. Seven are associated with DNA insertions. Four insertions are associated with dominant mutations and are located within or very near RNA coding sequences of the 37 kb transcription unit. Three insertions are associated with recessive mutations and fall within intervening sequences. The positions of all insertions agree with the genetic map. It is estimated that, in the Notch region, one map unit corresponds to approximately 275 kb. On this basis, most of the 17 mutations that were not associated with DNA insertions can be placed within coding sequences of the 37 kb transcription unit."
https://openalex.org/W2058486668,"Partially purified porcine PDGF or purified human PDGF in the presence of phosphodiesterase inhibitors caused marked accumulation of cAMP in Swiss 3T3 cells. The responses were time- and dosedependent; half-maximal effect was obtained at 0.6 nM PDGF. Indomethacin prevented the increase of cAMP levels in a dose-dependent manner; half-maximal effect was obtained at about 10 nM. Addition of PDGF increased (at least 25-fold) the production of E-type prostaglandins; PGE reached a concentration in the medium of 26 ng/ml 1 hr after treatment with human PDGF. This concentration of PGE produced a similar level of cAMP to that found with PDGF, suggesting that the PDGF-induced increase in cAMP is mediated by E-type prostaglandins released in the culture medium. Increased cAMP levels promoted by PDGF acting through stimulation of E-type prostaglandin synthesis may contribute to signal the initiation of cell proliferation in 3T3 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1556940478,"One of the monoclonal (AH-6) antibodies prepared by hybridoma technique against human gastric cancer cell line MKN74 was found to react with a series of glycolipids having the Y determinant (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 4[Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3]GlcNAc). The structure of one such glycolipid isolated from human colonic cancer and from dog intestine was identified as lactodifucohexaosyl-ceramide (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 4[Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3]GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1-ceramide; IV3,III3Fuc2nLc4Cer). The hapten glycolipid did not react with monoclonal antibodies directed to Lea, Leb, and X-hapten structures, and the AH-6 antibody did not react with the X-hapten ceramide pentasaccharide (Gal beta 1 leads to 4[Fuc alpha 1 leads to 3]GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1-ceramide), H1 glycolipid (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 4GlcNAc beta 1 leads to 3Gal beta 1 leads to 4Glc beta 1 leads to 1-ceramide), nor with glycolipids having the Leb (Fuc alpha 1 leads to 2Gal beta 1 leads to 3[Fuc alpha 1 leads 4]GlcNAc beta 1 leads to R) determinant. The antibody reacted with blood group O erythrocytes, but not with A erythrocytes. Immunostaining of thin layer chromatography with the monoclonal antibody AH-6 indicated that a series of glycolipids with the Y determinant is present in tumors and in O erythrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2087345258,"The role of various segments (gag or v-abl) of the Abelson murine leukemia virus (A-MuLV) genome in both lymphoid cell and fibroblast transformation was examined by deletion of areas from cloned, plasmid DNA representations of the genome. The deleted plasmids were tested by transfection into fibroblasts and by infection of bone marrow cells using virus stocks derived from the fibroblast transfectants. Deletion of gag coding sequence from the A-MuLV protein did not affect fibroblast transforming activity but abolished lymphoid transforming activity. The gag- A-MuLV genomes were very unstable in transformed fibroblasts leading to large secondary deletions in v-abl sequences. The gag- A-MuLV proteins also had lower autophosphorylation than their gag+ counterparts although cells transformed by gag- virus had a normal elevation of protein-linked phosphotyrosine. Systematic deletion of v-abl sequences showed that only 45,000 to the 130,000 molecular weight of v-abl sequence in the A-MuLV protein is needed for fibroblast transformation and, at most, slightly more is needed for lymphoid cell transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2016186706,"The hypothesis that the usual absence of neurofilaments in synaptic terminals is due to their degradation by the calcium-activated protease present in axoplasm was tested by injecting leupeptin, which inhibits the protease, into the optic tectum of goldfish kept at 15 degrees and at 25 degrees C. The resulting accumulation of neurofilaments in synaptic terminals provides in vivo evidence in support of the hypothesis. The significance of these results and the potential uses of this pharmacological tool are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1510604115,"Two recombinant phage clones bearing sequences corresponding to the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG beta) were isolated from a human genomic library. The beta sequences were mapped by blot hybridization of restriction digests of these phage DNAs and the nonoverlapping inserts were subcloned in pBR322 and sequenced. The nucleotide-sequencing data show that the hCG beta subunit is encoded by at least three nonallelic genes. Moreover, based on restriction analyses of human placental DNA, these genes may be linked in a single cluster with four other hCG beta-like genes. The sequenced genes all differ in their 5' flanking regions, and none of them is completely homologous in sequence to either of two hCG beta cDNA clones used here. In the translated region of one of these genes, three base substitutions result in two changes from the reported amino acid sequence. In the family of beta-containing glycoprotein hormones, the hCG beta subunit is unique in that it contains an extension of 29 amino acids at its COOH end. The DNA sequence corresponding to this region in the sequenced genes is part of a larger exon. These data show that the COOH-terminal extension does not result from splicing of the primary RNA transcript."
https://openalex.org/W1664376284,"Extracts of cultured 3T3 fibroblasts, obtained by homogenization and Triton X-100 solubilization, were fractionated on Sepharose columns covalently derivatized with asialofetuin. Three distinct carbohydrate-binding proteins (CBPs) were purified from the material bound to the affinity column: CBP35 (Mr = 35,000), CBP16 (Mr = 16,000), and CBP13.5 (Mr = 13,500). These CBPs were similar in several key properties. (a) They showed agglutination activity when assayed with rabbit erythrocytes; (b) they all appear to specifically recognize galactose-containing glycoconjugates; (c) they have low isoelectric points, pI 4.5-4.7; (d) their binding activities are rapidly lost in the absence of beta-mercaptoethanol; (e) the CBPs do not interact with each other, and the fractionated proteins can bind to asialofetuin independent of associated polypeptides; and (f) none of the proteins tend to self-associate to form oligomers of identical subunits. Comparisons of these and other properties of the CBPs suggest that CBP16 and CBP13.5 may be the murine counterparts of lactose-specific lectins previously identified in electric eel and in several bovine and avian tissues. In contrast, it appears that CBP35 represents a newly identified protein capable of binding to galactose-containing carbohydrates."

https://openalex.org/W2141944392,"Abstract Membranes derived from the Escherichia coli strain AN1460 which carries the multicopy plasmid pAN45 (unc+) (Downie, J. A., Langman, L., Cox, G. B., Yanofsky, C., and Gibson, (1980) J. Bacteriol. 143, 8-17) were enriched 5- to 10-fold in proton-ATPase activity. Incubation of F1-depleted AN1460 membranes with trypsin abolished F1-binding ability but did not inhibit proton transport through the membrane sector (F0). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis indicated that subunit (uncF protein) of F0 was cleaved by trypsin and prebound F1 protected against the trypsin effect. Subunits (uncB protein) and c (uncE protein) were unaffected by the trypsin treatment. A water-soluble fragment (Mr = 14,800) was liberated after trypsin treatment and appeared to arise from subunit b. Studies of enzyme hybridization and of F1 binding to membranes derived from strains containing mutations in uncB, F, and E genes supported the suggestion that subunit b is involved in F1 binding to the F0. Also, extraction of membranes with KSCN increased the relative proportion of subunit b in the membrane and this coincided with a parallel increase in trypsin-sensitive F1-binding ability. It is proposed that subunit b is involved in binding of F1 to the F0; this agrees with the presumed role of the protein as deduced from predictions of its secondary and tertiary structure (Walker, J. E., Saraste, M., and Gay, N. J. (1982) Nature (Lond.) 298, 867-869; Senior, A. E. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in press)."
https://openalex.org/W1990001255,"To study the function of pp60src, the transforming protein encoded for by Rous sarcoma virus, we have raised antibodies against synthetic oligopeptides corresponding to the primary structure of pp60src. All eight investigated peptides were immunogenic in rabbits, and four induced pp60src-specific antibodies. We screened tumor-bearing rabbit (TBR) sera for antibodies against the peptides; this revealed that five out of six of the peptides, chosen according to a high hydrophilicity plot, were related to epitopes of native pp60src, in contrast to two peptides of low hydrophilicity, which contained a cleavage site for protease. Antibodies against three of the peptides appeared to react with the kinase-active site of pp60src, as these antibodies were phosphorylated in their heavy chain upon immune precipitation. Antibodies against two of the peptides, in contrast to the others, did not precipitate pp60src when this molecule was complexed with two cellular proteins, pp50 and pp90. This observation allows speculation about the location of the pp60src site involved in the formation of this complex."

https://openalex.org/W1554077734,"A monoclonal antibody, tor70, recognizes an antigenic determinant on the inside surface of synaptic vesicles, purified from the electric organ of Narcine brasiliensis. The antigenic determinant appears to be unique to vesicles since it co-purifies with vesicle content and is blocked by an antiserum specific for synaptic vesicle antigens. Immunoblotting of vesicle proteins after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that the antigen has a low heterogeneous electrophoretic mobility and corresponds to a major protein component of pure synaptic vesicles. Synaptic vesicles contain a proteoglycan-like material since proteolytic digestion yields a ruthenium red-binding material that migrates during electrophoresis with a mammalian heparin standard. The only major vesicle component with which the proteoglycan-like material co-elutes during chromatography on Sepharose 6B is the material recognized by tor70. The antigen adsorbs specifically to beads coated with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin. Isolation of the tor70 antigen by velocity sedimentation in sodium dodecyl sulfate-sucrose gradients shows it to contain glucosamine (0.75 nmol/microgram of protein) and uronic acid but no galactosamine. Earlier work has shown that specific antiserum to pure synaptic vesicles could be used to identify nerve terminals, quantitate vesicle components, purify membranes, and monitor exocytosis. We now know that one of the components recognized by the antiserum is a molecule with properties of a proteoglycan, attached to the inside surface of vesicle membranes."
https://openalex.org/W2006686172,"We have analyzed the molecular nature of the Rise 56 mutation that occurs in barley. This mutation results in a depression of hordein accumulation in the grain and consequently in a higher overall lysine content. In particular, the amount of B hordein, which is encoded by the complex locus Hor-2, is decreased by about 75% because of the absence of the major components. The synthesis of certain minor polypeptides, with properties similar to the major B hordeins, remains unaffected. Analysis of endosperm RNA, by in vitro translation and hybridization to various cloned cDNAs derived from hordein mRNA, shows that mRNA for the major B hordeins is not present in the endosperm. Hybridization of a B hordein cDNA clone to gel-fractionated restriction digests of mutant and wild-type DNA indicates that at least 85 kb of DNA has been deleted from the Hor-2 locus in the high-lysine mutant."
https://openalex.org/W1551002057,"The molecular mechanisms regulating the induction of myosin heavy chain (MHC) gene expression during muscle cell differentiation were studied using a MHC cDNA recombinant plasmid. During in vitro L6E9 cell myogenesis, cytoplasmic MHC mRNA content/cell nucleus increases a minimum of 500-fold during the first 6 days of differentiation. Two independent parameters regulating MHC mRNA accumulation were directly measured. (i) Intrinsic (chemical) MHC mRNA stability (t1/2 = 55-60 h) is the same in both myotubes and when first detected in myoblasts. This suggests that the intrinsic stability of the MHC mRNA molecule does not change during myogenesis. (ii) The rate of MHC gene transcription and MHC mRNA synthesis increases approximately 100-fold during myogenesis but is insufficient to account for the entire MHC mRNA accumulation. An additional independent parameter was found to profoundly affect MHC mRNA accumulation. Withdrawal from the cell cycle, as occurs during terminal myogenic differentiation, increases the final accumulation of stable mRNAs, such as MHC, by increasing mRNA effective stability. During L6E9 myogenesis, the transition from mitotically active myoblasts (doubling time = 16 h) to postmitotic myotubes results in a 4-5-fold increase in the effective stability of cytoplasmic MHC mRNA. This cell cycle-mediated effect, combined with the induction of MHC mRNA synthesis, completely accounts for MHC mRNA accumulation. A parallel effect occurs in the total cytoplasmic poly(A)+ mRNA population. The rates of synthesis of each of the two major stability components (t1/2 = 5 and 50 h, respectively) are equally increased 2-3-fold during myogenesis. However, the composition of the cytoplasmic mRNA population changes due to the preferential accumulation of stable mRNAs. We conclude that both transcriptional and cell cycle-mediated regulation of MHC gene expression is necessary, but either alone is not sufficient to produce the differentiated muscle cell phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1664619999,"Fluorescence microphotolysis (photobleaching) has been widely used to measure translational diffusion coefficients of lipids and proteins in cell membranes. This communication shows that fluorescence microphotolysis can be also employed for measurement of membrane transport in single cells and organelles. The influx of fluorescently labeled dextrans of graded molecular size into leaky human erythrocyte ghosts and isolated rat liver cell nuclei has been measured. For the nuclear envelope, a functional pore radius of 56-59 A is derived."
https://openalex.org/W97961324,"Hepatic synthesis of alpha 2u-globulin in the male rat shows a gradual decline and ultimate loss during aging and senescence. Northern blot analysis with a cloned cDNA probe showed that the decrease in alpha 2u-globulin synthesis during aging is associated with a corresponding decrease in the concentration of its hepatic mRNA. By means of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, alpha 2u-globulin is resolved into a family of proteins. A monoclonal mouse antibody can identify at least five major isoelectric variants of alpha 2u-globulin within the total protein synthesized by rat hepatocytes. These isoelectric variants are also present in the in vitro translation products of hepatic mRNA. An examination of the hepatic synthesis of the isoelectric variants of alpha 2u-globulin during aging showed a differential regulation of the variant forms of this protein. Variant 2 (pI 6.1, the most prominent form) is the first to appear at puberty (40 days). The weakest member of the five major isoelectric forms (variant 4, pI 4.1) is the last to disappear at senescence. Although the overall decline in alpha 2u-globulin synthesis during aging seems to be due to an age-dependent decrease in the androgen responsiveness of hepatocytes, it is postulated that the differential regulation of the isoelectric variants may represent changes at the level of the genes coding for this protein."
https://openalex.org/W2088988268,"A protoplast fusion method was developed to stably transfect human cells with pSV2-derived plasmids at frequencies greater than 10(-3). This procedure made it possible to test the biological effect of a hepatitis B virus (HBV) gene independent of the viral structures required for infection. A pSV2gpt+ plasmid constructed to carry a subgenomic fragment of HBV that contained the core antigen gene (HBc gene) was transfected into human cells. A human epithelial cell line was stably transfected with the HBc+ gene by selecting recipient cells for expression of guanine phosphoribosyl transferase expression. With this gpt+/HBc+ cell line it was shown that growth in serum-free medium or treatment with 5'-azacytidine stimulates the production of the HBV core antigen. A hepatocellular carcinoma carrying the entire HBV genome was stimulated to produce the HBc gene product in response to the same factors that stimulated HBcAg production in the gpt+/HBc+ cell line constructed by transfection. The temporal relation between the cytopathologic response and HBc gene expression was similar for both cell types, indicating a primary role for HBc gene expression in the cytopathology of HBV-infected human liver."
https://openalex.org/W2009373941,"Peptidergic-noradrenergic interactions were examined in explants of rat sympathetic superior cervical ganglia and in cultures of dissociated cells. The putative peptide transmitters substance P and somatostatin each increased the activity of the catecholamine-synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase after 1 week of exposure in culture. Maximal increases occurred at 10(-7) molar for each peptide, and either increasing or decreasing the concentration reduced the effects. Similar increases in tyrosine hydroxylase were produced by a metabolically stable agonist of substance P, while a substance P antagonist prevented the effects of the agonist. The data suggest that the increased tyrosine hydroxylase activity was mediated by peptide interaction with specific substance P receptors and that peptides may modulate sympathetic catecholaminergic function."
https://openalex.org/W1519577579,"A hybridoma cell line producing a monoclonal antibody directed to N-acetylneuraminosyl-alpha 2 leads to 6-galactosyl residue has been established. The antibody is IgG2b and reacts only with lacto-series gangliosides as well as with glycoproteins having an N-acetylneuraminosyl-alpha 2 leads to 6-galactosyl residue, but does not react with gangliosides or glycoproteins having an N-acetylneuraminosyl-alpha 2 leads to 3- or -alpha 2 leads to 4-galactosyl residue. The antibody is useful for detecting the specific carbohydrate chain having this terminal structure by immunostaining of glycolipids separated on thin layer chromatography or glycoproteins separated on gel electrophoresis after blotting on nitrocellulose sheet. A remarkable accumulation of a few gangliosides having this terminal structure has been detected by this monoclonal antibody in some human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1496430412,"The La antigen recognized by certain lupus erythematosus autoantibodies was found to be predominantly associated with 7 S RNA in baby hamster kidney cells and human Raji cells, but not in HeLa cells where mainly the 7-2 RNA was associated with the La protein. In mouse myeloma cells (MPC-11) and mouse lymphoma cells (WEHI) that secrete immunoglobulins, equal amounts of 7 S and 7-2 RNAs were present in anti-La immunoprecipitates. The highly conserved 7 S RNA is a component of the signal recognition particle involved in protein secretion (Walter, P., and Blobel, G. (1982) Nature (Lond.) 299, 691-698), and its association with the La antigen appeared to be cell-type specific. Thus, it is possible that the La-7 S RNA association correlates with the abundance of 7 S RNA or with the secretory activity of the cell type."
https://openalex.org/W1984398513,"The transport of specific proteins in regenerating optic fibers of goldfish depends on the presence or absence of the optic tectum. When optic fibers were allowed to contact the tectum, amounts of rapidly transported proteins having molecular weights between 120,000 and 160,000 increased, and a species of molecular weight 26,000 reverted to normal levels. When nerves were prevented from contacting the tectum, the amount of the 26,000-molecular weight protein remained high for months. Amounts of other transported proteins, in particular a group of acidic components of molecular weight 44,000 to 49,000 that increase greatly at early stages of regeneration, proved to be independent of the tectum."
https://openalex.org/W1480414893,"During the embryonic development of the chicken, stimulation of production of collagen-enriched tissue such as bone matrix, cartilage matrix, and skin dermis occurs between day 7 and day 15. We have examined the levels of the RNAs encoding the interstitial collagens (types I, II, and III) to determine if this developmental progress is associated with increased accumulation of collagen RNA. Using cell-free translation and DNA:RNA hybridization techniques, we have detected a coordinate enhancement of approximately 10-fold in the steady state levels of whole embryo RNAs encoding the alpha 1(I), alpha 2(I), alpha 1(II), and alpha 1(III) collagens between 5 and 10 days of chick embryonic development. The developmental pattern of expression of these collagen genes in whole embryos is in marked contrast to that of two noncollagenous proteins, cellular fibronectin and beta-actin, whose RNA levels were not found to change dramatically during early chicken development. In addition, we have observed that at least 3 of the 4 collagen genes examined were expressed at low levels beginning between 1-2 days. Both 5'- and 3'-specific alpha 2(I) collagen gene DNA probes hybridized to early stage and late stage chick embryo RNAs of identical sizes. DNase I-hypersensitive sites have been detected near the 5' end of the alpha 2(I) collagen gene in chromatin isolated from both 2-day and 5-day embryos, representing developmental time points well before and at the threshold of the onset of enhanced collagen RNA synthesis, respectively. These results suggest that the same gene is expressed in early and late chick embryos to yield alpha 2(I) collagen RNAs of similar structure."

The molecule produced by Escherichia coli is slightly larger than the M protein isolated by solubilization of the streptococcal cell wall, but is similar in size to that secreted by streptococcal protoplast and L forms. Immunologically, the molecule synthesized by Escherichia coli has the same type-specific determinants as the streptococcal M protein."
https://openalex.org/W1519761239,"We have studied the regulation of the biosynthesis of thyrotropin (TSH) and its alpha and beta subunits by thyroid hormone in thyrotropic tumors carried in hypothyroid mice. Treatment with 3,5,3'-triiodo-L-thyronine (T3) (20 micrograms/100 g, body weight) daily for 4 or 10 days reduced serum TSH to 3 and 0.3% of control, respectively. Serum levels of free alpha subunit were reduced to 60 and 11% of control at 4 days and 10 days, respectively, and serum free TSH-beta was undetectable at both time points. There was no significant decrease in tumor TSH content after 4 days of treatment and, after 10 days, TSH content was reduced to 15% of control levels. There was no significant effect of T3 on tumor alpha subunit levels at either 4 or 10 days. In contrast, tumor TSH-beta content was markedly reduced after 4 days and 10 days of T3 treatment, to 29 and 10% of control levels, respectively. Translation of tumor poly(A) mRNA in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system showed that thyroid hormone decreased translatable TSH-beta mRNA to undetectable levels at both 4 and 10 days, whereas translatable alpha mRNA was reduced strikingly only at 10 days in one of two tumors. RNA blot hybridization with 32P-labeled plasmid probes containing alpha or TSH-beta cDNAs showed that TSH-beta mRNA was reduced to less than 10% of control after both 4 and 10 days of T3 treatment, whereas, again, alpha mRNA was only reduced in one of two tumors at 10 days. Our data thus show that thyroid hormone affects alpha and TSH-beta mRNA and protein levels discordantly and suggest that regulation of TSH biosynthesis may occur predominantly at the level of TSH-beta mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1492828414,"Electrophoresis of rat dorsal prostate mRNAs on agarose gels containing methyl mercury hydroxide indicates the presence of several highly abundant mRNAs. In vitro translation of the total mRNAs in a cell-free system, followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, yields protein products including two intense bands corresponding to 23,000 and 21,000 Da. Following castration of rats, these in vitro translation products of dorsal prostate mRNAs are absent. However, the dorsal prostate levels of these two proteins are returned to normal in castrated rats which have received testosterone. In order to investigate these abundant mRNAs of the dorsal prostate, we have constructed double-stranded cDNA clones using poly(A+) RNA extracted from that rat tissue. Clones containing sequences complementary to abundant mRNAs were selected kinetically by colony hybridization with 32P-labeled dorsal prostate cDNA. Further characterization of individual clones was accomplished by restriction mapping and Northern blot analysis. One clone, pM-40, was found to be near full length and was used for further studies. Interestingly, in hybrid-arrested cell-free translation, clone pM-40 completely arrests the translation of both the 23,000- and 21,000-Da protein products indicating close sequence homology between these two proteins. Furthermore, dot hybridization experiments demonstrate that, in the dorsal prostate, the pM-40-specific mRNAs decrease following castration and are restored by testosterone administration. However, the low levels of the same mRNAs in the ventral prostate are not altered by androgen manipulation. Thus, two closely related, androgen-dependent tissues maintain differential regulation of the pM-40 gene(s). This system provides an opportunity to study in two tissues the differential regulation of a gene that may be duplicated or that may code for two separate proteins."

Neuronal cell-glial cell adhesion was inhibited by prior incubation of the neurons with Fab' fragments of antibodies to neuronal membranes. In contrast, antibodies to the neural cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM) did not inhibit the binding. These results suggest that a specific adhesive mechanism between neurons and glial cells exists and that it is mediated by CAM's that differ from those so far identified."

https://openalex.org/W1576666300,"A fraction of the insulin specifically bound to adipocytes undergoes a disulfide interchange with its receptor (Clark, S., and Harrison, L. C. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 12239-12244). In order to test the hypothesis that this covalent modification is a relevant step in insulin action, we have examined the relationship between disulfide binding of insulin and several insulin bioeffects, using sulfhydryl group blocking reagents as probes. The half-time of disappearance of disulfide linked insulin-receptor complexes (I-(S-S)-R) was rapid (4.5 min), consistent with their hypothesized role. A cell-impermeable reagent 5,5'-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) had no effect on specific insulin binding but caused a dose-dependent decrease in both I-(S-S)-R and insulin-stimulated glucose transport. DTNB also inhibited the effect of insulin to stimulate glucose oxidation and to inhibit epinephrine-stimulated cyclic AMP production. In cultured IM-9 lymphocytes, insulin-induced down regulation of its receptor was decreased by 75% in the presence of 1 mM DTNB. Receptor antibodies stimulated adipocyte glucose transport maximally but their effect, unlike that of insulin, was not inhibited by DTNB. These findings suggest that receptor sulfhydryl groups are required for insulin action and support the notion that their interchange with insulin is a necessary step in activation of postreceptor pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1522934828,"Specific antibodies directed against each polypeptide component of yeast RNA polymerases A or B were prepared and their affinity spectrum determined by protein blot immunodetection. The majority of enzyme A or B subunits were specifically recognized by their respective antiserum. A direct correspondence was established between the polypeptides immunologically related in the three forms of RNA polymerases A, B, and C by reacting the different antibodies with enzymes subunits transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Subunit-specific antibodies and antibodies to native enzymes A and B were used to probe the activity of RNA polymerases A, B, and C. Based on DNA protection experiments, the largest subunit of enzymes A and B as well as the common subunit ABC23 appear to be involved in DNA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1542032127,"The activation of purine antimetabolites to their respective nucleotides is a step critical to their effectiveness as chemotherapeutic agents. Erythrocytes, with their relatively simple purine metabolism, are useful as a model for identifying mechanisms which enhance this 5-phosphoribosyl 1-pyrophosphate (P-Rib-PP)-dependent activation. We previously showed that pyrroline-5-carboxylate, a physiologic intermediate in the interconversions of proline, ornithine, and glutamate, markedly stimulated the pentose phosphate pathway, increased the formation of P-Rib-PP, and increased purine incorporation into nucleotides. We now report that the events initiated by pyrroline-5-carboxylate markedly increased the activation of 6-thiohypoxanthine, 6-thioguanine, and azathioprine to their respective nucleotides in intact human erythrocytes. The mechanism of this effect was directly demonstrated in studies using the conversion of hypoxanthine to inosine monophosphate as a model for pyrroline-5-carboxylate-mediated stimulation of P-Rib-PP-dependent nucleotide formation. Since the P-Rib-PP-dependent activation of these chemotherapeutic agents may be important to their clinical effectiveness, the events initiated by pyrroline-5-carboxylate may provide new insight into the nature of tumor sensitivity and resistance to these agents."

https://openalex.org/W1538660066,"The low temperature structural transition (low leads to high) of 5 S RNA from Escherichia coli is investigated by partial digestion with ribonuclease T1. In addition to a general masking of guanines from the nuclease, differential changes of accessibility are observed when Mg2+ and salt concentrations are increased to bring about the low leads to high transition. Residue G13 becomes more exposed in the high form while residues G54, G56, G61, G72, and G83-86 become less exposed. The observed cutting rate at other sites is unchanged. A possible conformational change is discussed which could explain the observed changes in RNase T1 digestion patterns as well as the physical chemical observations."
https://openalex.org/W1964460354,"Interferon-treated cells rapidly and efficiently transferred the antiproliferative activity of interferon to untreated cells. This phenomenon was not due to the carry-over of interferon by the interferon-treated cells. Thus, to evoke an antiproliferative state, interferon did not directly contact each cell in a population. The results suggest a novel mechanism by which interferon may indirectly regulate cell growth, and suggests that cells other than those of the immune system may play a role in controlling tumor growth in tissue where cell-to-cell contact occurs."
https://openalex.org/W1485574447,"Monoclonal antibodies were raised against a 5 S gene-specific transcription factor (TFIIIA) from Xenopus laevis oocytes. Seven stable hybridoma lines were established and shown to secrete antibodies directed against different antigenic structures present on distinct peptides of the factor (generated by cleavage of TFIIIA with cyanogen bromide). All antibodies react with denatured TFIIIA in nitrocellulose blots, but only five are able to bind to the native protein. These antibodies recognize the transcription factor not only in its purified (RNA-free) form, but also when it is complexed with 5 S RNA in 7 S ribonucleoprotein complexes. None of the monoclonal antibodies inhibits transcription of 5 S genes in vitro, although an interaction of the antibodies with the factor in a transcription reaction could be demonstrated by a depletion assay. Thus, binding of the antibodies to TFIIIA does not interfere with the function of the factor during transcription initiation. Additionally, it was found that transcriptionally active TFIIIA could be purified to greater than 95% homogeneity from ovarian extracts using an antibody coupled to Sepharose."
https://openalex.org/W1520781385,"The molecular basis for altered cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase activity was examined in three different mutant clones (Kin-1, Kin-7, and Kin-8) derived from the Y1 mouse adrenocortical cell line. Parental Y1 cells and the Kin mutants were labeled with L-[35S] methionine and the regulatory subunit of the type 1 cAMP-dependent protein kinase isozyme (RI) was immunoprecipitated from each clone with a specific guinea pig antiserum. When analyzed by electrophoresis on isoelectric focusing gels, the immunoprecipitates from mutant clones exhibited parental forms of RI plus an additional acidic variant form which likely accounted for altered cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from Y1 and Kin mutant cells and was translated in a cell-free, reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of L-[35S]methionine. The RI synthesized from poly(A+) RNA was immunoprecipitated from the translation mixture and analyzed on isoelectric focusing gels. The poly(A+) RNA from the Kin mutant clones directed the synthesis of parental and acidic variant forms of RI. These results suggest that the altered electrophoretic forms of RI arise from mutations in one of two RI genes rather than from post-translational modifications of the protein. The coexistence of parental and variant forms of RI in the Kin mutants indicate that the mutations are codominant."
https://openalex.org/W1570818559,"The specific stimulation of alpha-amanitin-sensitive RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei by methyl mercury (Frenkel, G. D., and Randles, K. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 6275-6279) has been further investigated. Using the method of alkaline hydrolysis/uridine analysis to determine the number of RNA chains growing in vitro, it was found that the stimulation could not be accounted for by an increase in the number of growing chains. The stimulatory effect of heparin (Coupar, B. E. H., and Chesterton, C. J. (1977) Eur. J. Biochem. 79, 525-533), was found to be additive with that of methyl mercury at saturating concentrations of the latter. Various detergents were found to affect RNA synthesis per se and to modify the stimulatory effect of methyl mercury, suggesting that the stimulation by methyl mercury requires a degree of structural integrity of some nuclear components. The ability of a number of other mercury compounds to stimulate RNA synthesis was investigated. None of the inorganic compounds examined, i.e. HgCl2, HgSO4, and Hg(ClO4)2, stimulated synthesis. Among the alkyl organic compounds tested in addition to methyl mercury, ethyl mercury also stimulated RNA synthesis, but dimethylmercury did not. Among the aryl compounds tested, phenylmercury did not stimulate synthesis whereas p-hydroxymercuribenzoate and p-hydroxymercuribenzenesulfonate did. N-Ethylmaleimide, a nonmercurous sulfhydryl reagent, was found to have only weak ability to stimulate RNA synthesis, compared to a comparable mercury-containing sulfhydryl reagent, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate. The stimulatory effect of the latter was, however, effectively competed out by the former, indicating that sulfhydryl binding is necessary for the stimulation but not sufficient. This conclusion was reinforced by experiments which utilized a model system to measure the ability of various mercury compounds to compete with N-ethylmaleimide in binding to cysteine. The results showed that even compounds such as phenylmercury and the inorganic mercurials, which are unable to stimulate RNA synthesis, are able to bind to a sulfhydryl group."
https://openalex.org/W1587325287,"Analogues of the microbial proteinase inhibitor chymostatin have been synthesized. The two most promising analogues were tested on protein turnover in isolated rat hepatocytes. Their effect is much similar to the effect of chymostatin, but the analogues are even more powerful inhibitors, probably due to an increased effect on lysosomal thiol proteinases. The analogues blocked most of the lysosomal (i.e. methylamine-sensitive) degradation of endogenous protein and caused a 50% inhibition of the non-lysosomal degradation; the effect occurred rapidly and was reversed upon washing the cells. One of the analogues, Z-Arg-Leu-Phe(H), is the most potent inhibitor of hepatic protein degradation so far found."
https://openalex.org/W1534653355,"The cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, a lower eukaryote, was shown to contain several species of small nuclear RNA (Takeishi, K., and Kaneda, S. (1981) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 90, 299-308; Wise, J. A., and Weiner, A. M. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 956-963). One of these RNAs, Dd9 or D2, was sequenced and found to be homologous to mammalian nucleolar U3 RNA. In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of another Dictyostelium small nuclear RNA Dd8 was determined by direct analysis. The sequence is: (formula; see text) Dd8 RNA contains high proportions of A (34%) and U (30%). No modified nucleotide could be detected in the internal region. Computer-assisted analysis of sequence homology indicated that Dd8 RNA is not homologous to any other small nuclear RNA species sequenced so far."
https://openalex.org/W1600739128,"A mutant murine T-cell line which overproduces purines and excretes massive quantities of inosine into the culture medium has served as a cell culture model for overproduction hyperuricemia (Ullman, B., Wormsted, M. A., Cohen, M. B., and Martin, D. W., Jr. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 79, 5127-5131). Incubation of these cells with micromolar concentrations of dipyridamole, a potent inhibitor of nucleoside transport, prevents the excretion of inosine and depresses the rate of purine biosynthesis to that of wild type cells. These concentrations of dipyridamole have no effect on cellular growth rate or on the intracellular nucleoside triphosphate or phosphoribosylpyrophosphate pools. We suggest that dipyridamole might also be useful in ameliorating purine overproduction associated with hyperuricemia and gout."
https://openalex.org/W1553740833,"Abstract The effect of the folded macromolecular structure of RNA on the action of a purified single strand specific nucleolar ribonuclease was studied by comparing the limited hydrolysis of defined RNA substrates. The nucleolar RNase was shown to attack only single-stranded regions of the native 5.8 S rRNA, consistent with a computer-derived model for the secondary structure (Nazar, R. N., Stitz, T. O., and Busch, H. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 8591-8597). The single strand specific nucleolar RNase, unlike S1 nuclease, does not release the end-labeled nucleotide and therefore provides a more useful probe for structural analysis at or near 3'- or 5'-terminal ends of an RNA molecule. Although attacking only single strand regions of the native 5.8 S rRNA, the selectivity of the nucleolar RNase, when compared to S1 nuclease, is distinct and supports the suggestion that other factors besides the proposed secondary structure must also influence nuclease attack. The selective and limited attack of the nucleolar RNase on native RNA was similarly observed using mouse 45 S preribosomal RNA as a substrate and possibly suggests a role for this nucleolar RNase in ribosomal RNA processing."
