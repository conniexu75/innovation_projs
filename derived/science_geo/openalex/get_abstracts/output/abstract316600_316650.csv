https://openalex.org/W1979219735,"Lunar Orbiter tracking data have been processed to supply a qualitatively consistent gravimetric map of the lunar nearside. While a simplified model was employed, the results indicate that there are large mass concentrations under the lunar ringed maria. These mass concentrations may have important implications for the various theories regarding lunar history."

https://openalex.org/W1979352082,"A year-long monitoring program within an elongated channel-fan system in Bute Inlet of British Columbia, Canada, detected active sand-transporting turbidity currents. Measurements of bottom velocities and sediment collected in traps, as well as damage to moorings and equipment, captured the signatures of frequent energetic events. Maximum calculated velocities achieved were 335 centimeters per second, with flow thicknesses of more than 30 meters. Coarse sand was transported at least 6 to 7.5 meters above the sea floor. Turbidity currents flowed a minimum distance of 25.9 kilometers, but possibly as far as 40 to 50 kilometers, over bottom slopes of generally less than 1Â°."
https://openalex.org/W2070542211,"Silicate aggregates, including large single crystals of potassium feldspar as long as 11 centimeters and sodium feldspar, are embeded in the surface of the medium octahedrite Colomera. Silicate nodules in the interior appear to be much smaller (about 0.3 centimeter). Glass nodules are abundant both on the external surface and in the interior. These observations are evidence that some iron meteorites formed as segregations within a silicate matrix and did not originate in a metallic core."
https://openalex.org/W1996394052,"Lignins and suberins are complex plant cell-wall macromolecules that are composed mainly of phenylpropanoid residues derived from L-phenylalanine. Lignins and suberins are considered to be covalently linked to carbohydrates and to lipids, respectively. The bonding of these important structural materials within cell walls has never been established. By feeding specifically labeled [(13)C] ferulic acid over extended durations to seedlings of Triticum aestivum L. and by using solid-state carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance techniques, the major resonances due to specific carbons in the propanoid side chains of these cell-wall polymers have been identified in situ. The signals were found to differ significantly from those of synthetic lignins, which have usually been considered to be good approximations of natural lignin structure."
https://openalex.org/W2068394337,"On 16 August 1983 the Infrared Astronomical Satellite made two separate pointed observations of Pluto and its moon Charon. Because of the small angular displacement of the system between the times of measurement, the Pluto-Charon system was identified as a source in the Serendipitous Survey (SSC 14029+0518). Detections were made at 60 and 100 micrometers with color-corrected flux densities of 581 +/- 58 and 721 +/- 123 millijanskys, respectively. Pluto is best described as having a dark equatorial band, and brighter polar caps of methane ice extending to +/-45 degrees latitude, at most. An upper limit of approximately 9 meter-amagats is placed on the column abundance of a methane atmosphere on Pluto, which is comparable to recent upper limits based on independent ground-based spectroscopy."
https://openalex.org/W2028923631,"The 3 March 1987 Charon occultation by Pluto was observed in the infrared at 1.5, 1.7, 2.0, and 2.35 micrometers. Subtraction of fluxes measured between second and third contacts from measurements made before and after the event has yielded individual spectral signatures for each body at these wavelengths. Charon's surface appears depleted in methane relative to Pluto. Constancy of flux at 2.0 micrometers throughout the event shows that Charon is effectively black at this wavelength, which is centered on a very strong water absorption band. Thus, the measurements suggest the existence of water ice on Pluto's moon."
https://openalex.org/W2076548647,"The power available from transistor-sized semiconductor diode lasers has increased rapidly in recent years, more than doubling every year. Continuous outputs of several watts and pulsed powers in the kilowatt range with 50 percent overall efficiency are now possible with these compact devices. These developments may signal the start of a technological advancement in optics comparable to the solid-state revolution in electronics 20 years ago."

https://openalex.org/W2085042430,"Swarms of seaquakes have been located hydroacoustically on Gorda Ridge near 41.5 degrees N, 127.6 degrees W, where detailed bathymetric charts indicate a slight dextral offset of the rift valley in the center of the ridge. It is suggested that a fracture zone may be nascent in the area."
