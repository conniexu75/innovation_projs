https://openalex.org/W2071177681,"The complement system is an important mediator of the acute inflammatory response, and an effective inhibitor would suppress tissue damage in many autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Such an inhibitor might be found among the endogenous regulatory proteins of complement that block the enzymes that activate C3 and C5. Of these proteins, complement receptor type 1 (CR1; CD35) has the most inhibitory potential, but its restriction to a few cell types limits its function in vivo. This limitation was overcome by the recombinant, soluble human CR1, sCR1, which lacks the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The sCR1 bivalently bound dimeric forms of its ligands, C3b and methylamine-treated C4 (C4-ma), and promoted their inactivation by factor I. In nanomolar concentrations, sCR1 blocked complement activation in human serum by the two pathways. The sCR1 had complement inhibitory and anti-inflammatory activities in a rat model of reperfusion injury of ischemic myocardium, reducing myocardial infarction size by 44 percent. These findings identify sCR1 as a potential agent for the suppression of complement-dependent tissue injury in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1987864496,"alpha-Bungarotoxin (alpha Bgt) is a potent, high-affinity antagonist for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) from muscle, but not for AChRs from neurons. Both muscle and neuronal AChRs are thought to be formed from multiple homologous subunits aligned around a central cation channel whose opening is regulated by ACh binding. In contrast, the exact structure and function of high-affinity alpha Bgt binding proteins (alpha BgtBPs) found in avian and mammalian neurons remain unknown. Here we show that cDNA clones encoding alpha BgtBP alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits define alpha BgtBPs as members of a gene family within the ligand-gated ion channel gene superfamily, but distinct from the gene families of AChRs from muscles and nerves. Subunit-specific monoclonal antibodies raised against bacterially expressed alpha BgtBP alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunit fragments reveal the existence of at least two different alpha BgtBP subtypes in embryonic day 18 chicken brains. More than 75% of all alpha BgtBPs have the alpha 1 subunit, but no alpha 2 subunit, and a minor alpha BgtBP subtype (approximately 15%) has both the alpha 1 and alpha 2 subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1588226764,"Macrophages express a cell surface receptor which mediates phagocytosis and pinocytosis of particles and solutes containing mannose (fucose and N-acetylglucosamine are also ligands for the receptor). An apparently identical protein has been isolated from human placenta. Proteolytic fragments of the placental receptor were sequenced so that oligonucleotide probes complementary to the receptor cDNA could be generated. These probes were used to isolate cDNA clones covering the entire coding portion of the mRNA for the receptor. Confirmation that these clones encode the mannose receptor was obtained by expression in rat fibroblasts. The expressed protein mediates uptake and degradation of mannose-conjugated serum albumin. The deduced amino acid sequence of the receptor reveals that it is most likely to be a type I transmembrane protein (COOH terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane) since the mature polypeptide is preceded by a signal sequence and a hydrophobic stop transfer sequence is located 45 amino acids from the COOH terminus. The extracellular portion of the receptor polypeptide consists of three types of domains. The first 139 amino acids constitute a cysteine-rich segment which does not resemble other known sequences. There follows a domain which closely resembles fibronectin type II repeats. The remainder of the extracellular portion of the receptor is composed of eight segments homologous with the C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains of the asialoglycoprotein receptor, mannose binding proteins, and other Ca2(+)-dependent animal lectins. This structure suggests that the receptor may contain multiple ligand-binding domains thus accounting for its tight binding to highly multivalent ligands."
https://openalex.org/W1976814021,"Neurogenesis in the adult avian brain is restricted to the telencephalon. New neurons originate in the ventricular zone (VZ) from cells that have not been identified. We mapped the position of [3H]thymidine-labeled cells in the walls of the ventricles of the adult canary brain. Labeled VZ cells were restricted to the telencephalon (lateral ventricles) and concentrated in “hot spots”. The coincidence of these hot spots with regions rich in radial cells suggested that radial cells may be the cells undergoing mitosis. We used smears prepared from fragments of the VZ containing the hot spots to show directly that radial cells accumulate [3H]thymidine. In addition, grain counts at different survival times demonstrated that these cells divide. Hot spots of VZ cell division also coincided with sites of neuronal origin. We suggest that radial cell division may give rise to new neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1512600725,"Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a potent mitogen for quiescent fibroblasts. Among the earliest detectable responses to LPA is GTP-dependent phosphoinositide hydrolysis (van Corven, E. J., Groenink, A., Jalink, K., Eichholtz, T., and Moolenaar, W. H. (1989) Cell 59, 45-54). Here we describe the Ca2(+)-mobilizing properties of LPA in human fibroblasts and present evidence suggesting that previously reported Ca2(+)-mobilizing effects of phosphatidic acid are attributable to contamination with LPA. Addition of LPA (1-oleoyl or 1-palmitoyl) to fibroblasts evokes the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate accompanied by an immediate but transient rise in [Ca2+]i which originates primarily from intracellular stores. The Ca2+ response is dose-dependent with a half-maximal effect at LPA concentrations as low as 10 ng/ml, far below the reported half-maximal effect for DNA synthesis (5-10 micrograms/ml). LPA-induced Ca2+ release is also observed in various other cell types, both normal and transformed, but not in Jurkat T cells and neutrophils. The Ca2(+)-mobilizing action of LPA is specific, in that 1,2-dioleoyl-phosphatidic acid (when prepared free of LPA contaminants), other lysophospholipids, monoacylglycerol, and free fatty acids have no effect. Furthermore, LPA, unlike lysophosphatidylcholine, does not cause detectable membrane leakiness, even when added at high concentrations (500 micrograms/ml). The LPA-induced Ca2+ signal is blocked completely by tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, but is not affected by prior stimulation of the cells with Ca2(+)-mobilizing agonists such as bradykinin or histamine. In contrast, pretreating the cells with a low dose of LPA desensitizes the Ca2+ response to subsequent addition of higher doses. This homologous desensitization is not inhibited by staurosporine, nor by down-regulating protein kinase C with tetradecanoylphorbol acetate, suggesting independence of functional protein kinase C activity. Addition of La3+ instantaneously blocks inositol phosphate production and Ca2+ mobilization in response to LPA, but not to bradykinin, most likely due to formation of inactive La3(+)-LPA complexes, suggesting that LPA acts at an extracellular site on the plasma membrane to trigger GTP-dependent phosphoinositide breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W1972417671,"Enzymatic synthesis of methyl halides through an S-adenosyl methionine transfer mechanism has been detected in cell extracts of Phellinus promaceus (a white rot fungus), Endocladia muricata (a marine red algae), and Mesembryanthemum crystallium (ice plant). This mechanism represents a novel pathway for the formation of halometabolites. The Michaelis constants for chloride and bromide ion and for S-adenosyl methionine in the reaction have been determined for the enzyme from E. muricata. A recent survey of marine algae indicates that there may be a broad distribution of this enzyme among marine algae."
https://openalex.org/W1568812849,"We investigated the effects of glucocorticoids on group II phospholipase A2 (PLA2) expression in rat cultured smooth muscle cells. Both forskolin-induced and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced PLA2 release responses were almost completely blocked by 10 and 100 nM dexamethasone, respectively, as assayed by protein blotting and PLA2 activity assays. Dexamethasone-mediated inhibition of PLA2 release appeared to be mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor. Dexamethasone at concentrations greater than 10 nM inhibited forskolin-induced elevation of the group II PLA2 mRNA level but not TNF-induced elevation. These data suggest that the mechanism mediating forskolin-induced mRNA accumulation is sensitive to glucocorticoids, but the mechanism mediating the TNF-induced accumulation is not. Inhibition of TNF-induced PLA2 release by glucocorticoids may be explained by the blocking of post-transcriptional synthesis of the group II PLA2."

https://openalex.org/W1969254666,"Human neutrophils can initiate the rapid degradation of extracellular matrix macromolecules by localizing the destructive process to sites of cell-substrate contact. Although plasma and its filtrates contain multiple proteinase inhibitors, these inhibitors did not prevent neutrophils from attacking either underlying fibronectin or elastin. However, subjacent substrates could be protected from neutrophils by recombinant secretory leukoprotease inhibitor, a structurally unique serine proteinase inhibitor whose natural counterpart is normally confined to human mucous secretions. The identification of this extravascular proteinase inhibitor as a potent regulator of subjacent proteolysis could lead to the development of a new class of anti-inflammatory therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1574193072,"The acetyl low density lipoprotein (LDL), or scavenger, receptor, which binds modified forms of LDL, was thought to be expressed only on macrophages and endothelial cells. We demonstrate that rabbit fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells bind, internalize, and degrade acetoacetylated LDL, a ligand for the acetyl LDL receptor. Degradation is specific in that unlabeled acetoacetylated LDL and fucoidin, a known competitor for binding to the acetyl LDL receptor, are effective competitors, while native LDL is not. The acetyl LDL receptor on these cells is readily regulated. Higher levels of degradation are observed in cells preincubated with serum than in cells preincubated with plasma. This up-regulation of the acetyl LDL receptor is most likely due to the presence of platelet secretory products in serum since secretion products derived from thrombin-stimulated platelets also cause an increase in degradation. In addition, preincubation of rabbit fibroblasts with phorbol esters results in a 16-20-fold increase in specific degradation. These results indicate that rabbit fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells express the acetyl LDL receptor and that increased receptor expression appears to be mediated through activation of the protein kinase C pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2022449252,"The role of ocular muscle proprioception in the localization of visual targets has been investigated in normal humans by deviating one eye to create an experimental strabismus. The passively deviated eye was covered and the other eye viewed the target. With a hand-pointing task, targets were systematically mislocalized in the direction of the deviated nonviewing eye. A 4- to 6-degree error resulted when the nonviewing eye was offset 30 degrees from straight ahead. When the eye was deviated, the perceived ""straight-ahead"" was also displaced, by a similar amount, in the same direction. Since the efferent motor commands to the displaced and to the nondisplaced eyes are presumably identical by the law of equal innervation, the mislocalization of visual objects must be attributed to the change in proprioceptive information issued from the nonviewing, deviated eye. Thus proprioception contributes to the localization of objects in space."
https://openalex.org/W2072218174,"The inviability of diploid androgenetic and parthenogenetic embryos suggests imprinting of paternal and maternal genes during germ cell development, and differential expression of loci depending on parental inheritance appears to be involved. To facilitate identification of imprinted genes, we have derived diploid androgenetic embryonic stem (ES) cell lines. In contrast to normal ES cells, they form tumors composed almost entirely of striated muscle when injected subcutaneously into adult mice. They also form chimeras following blastocyst injection, although many chimeras die at early postnatal stages. Surviving chimeras develop skeletal abnormalities, particularly in the rib cartilage. These results demonstrate that androgenetic ES cells are pluripotent and point to stage- and cell-specific expression of developmentally important imprinted genes."
https://openalex.org/W1598886839,"Two isoforms (A and B) of the human (hPR) and chicken (cPR) progesterone receptors originate from a single PR gene. cPR form A results from initiation of translation at a downstream ATG codon (ATG2) which in the cPR cDNA-deduced open reading frame is found 128 amino acids C-terminal to and in-frame with the first ATG codon (ATG1) that gives rise to form B. Our recent observation of an abundant cPR mRNA which encodes only form A suggested to us that the two isoforms are translated from different transcripts (Jeltsch, J. M., Turcotte, B., Garnier, J. M., Lerouge, T., Krozowski, Z., Gronemeyer, H., and Chambon, P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3961-3974). This view is, however, at variance with data obtained by transient transfection with expression vectors containing most of the cPR cDNA (downstream of nucleotide +53) since both isoforms were generated in transiently transfected COS cells (Conneely, O. M., Kettelberger, D. M., Tsai, J. J., Schrader, W. T., and O'Malley, B. W. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 14062-14064). To further support our above conclusion, vectors containing either hPR or cPR cDNAs were introduced into HeLa and COS-1 cells. Only hPR form B originated from a vector containing the entire cDNA (containing nucleotides 1 to approximately 4400), and form A was produced only from a vector expressing hPR transcripts (nucleotides 814 to approximately 4400) lacking ATG1. Vectors expressing the 5'-untranslated and coding region of the cPR mRNA (nucleotides 29-2921) generated only traces of form A in the two cell lines. Similar traces of form A were observed in COS-1 cells transfected with a vector lacking the 5'-untranslated region. Collectively, these results do not support the hypothesis that similar amounts of the two PR isoforms are generated by alternative initiation of translation on a single PR transcript. We discuss data indicating that for hPR and cPR, isoforms A and B are in fact translated from different mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2032046420,"T cell hybridomas that express zeta zeta, but not zeta eta, dimers in their T cell receptors (TCRs) produce interleukin-2 (IL-2) and undergo an inhibition of spontaneous growth when activated by antigen, antibodies to the receptor, or antibodies to Thy-1. Hybridomas without zeta and eta were reconstituted with mutated zeta chains. Cytoplasmic truncations of up to 40% of the zeta molecule reconstituted normal surface assembly of TCRs, but antigen-induced IL-2 secretion and growth inhibition were lost. In contrast, cross-linking antibodies to the TCR activated these cells. A point mutation conferred the same signaling phenotype as did the truncations and caused defective antigen-induced tyrosine kinase activation. Thus zeta allows the binding of antigen/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) to alpha beta to effect TCR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1650068461,"Glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa is the major fibrinogen receptor on platelets and participates in platelet aggregation at the site of a wound. Integrin alpha v beta 3, which contains an identical beta-subunit, is expressed on endothelial cells and also serves as a fibrinogen receptor. Here, we demonstrate by several criteria that purified GPIIb-IIIa and integrin alpha v beta 3 bind to distinct sites on fibrinogen. First, a plasmin-generated fragment of fibrinogen lacking the RGD sequence at residues 572-574 retained the ability to bind GPIIb-IIIa, but failed to bind integrin alpha v beta 3. Second, a monoclonal antibody which exclusively recognizes the RGD sequence at fibrinogen A alpha chain residues 572-574 abolished interaction between integrin alpha v beta 3 and fibrinogen, but had only a minimal effect on fibrinogen binding to GPIIb-IIIa. Finally, we show that the difference in recognition of sites on fibrinogen by these two integrins is probably a consequence of their remarkably different ligand binding properties. Peptides corresponding to fibrinogen gamma chain residues 400-411 effectively blocked RGD sequence and fibrinogen binding by GPIIb-IIIa, but had no effect on the ability of integrin alpha v beta 3 to bind these ligands. We also show that integrin alpha v beta 3 has a higher affinity than GPIIb-IIIa for a synthetic hexapeptide containing the RGD sequence. In fact, this RGD-containing peptide was 150-fold more effective at blocking fibrinogen binding to integrin alpha v beta 3 than to GPIIb-IIIa. Collectively, our results demonstrate that integrins alpha v beta 3 and GPIIb-IIIa display qualitative and quantitative differences in their ligand binding properties, as is evident by their ability to interact with synthetic peptides. The ultimate result of these differences is the recognition of distinct sites on fibrinogen by the two integrins. These observations may have relevance in the processes of hemostasis and wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1969258789,"The sweat glands, a target of cholinergic sympathetic neurons, were replaced with parotid gland, a target of noradrenergic sympathetic neurons, in neonatal rats. This transplantation paradigm allowed sympathetic neurons that would normally innervate the sweat glands and develop a cholinergic phenotype to innervate the parotid gland instead. The innervation of the transplanted parotid gland did not develop a cholinergic phenotype, as assessed by choline acetyltransferase activity and acetylcholinesterase immunoreactivity, but continued to express intense catecholamine fluorescence. In addition, immunoreactivity for vasoactive intestinal peptide, normally expressed by the sympathetic innervation of the sweat glands but not the parotid, was observed in only a small percentage of the parotid-associated fibers. These results suggest that cellular interactions between neurons and their targets play an important role in the differentiation of mature neurotransmitter and neuropeptide phenotypes in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1513042772,"Human erythropoietin contains three Asn-type and one mucin-type sugar chains. That the branching structure of the outer portion of Asn-type sugar chains is correlated to its biological activity in vivo has been reported recently (Takeuchi, M., Inoue, N., Strickland, T. W., Kubota, M., Wada, M., Shimizu, R., Hoshi, S., Kozutsumi, H., Takasaki, S., and Kobata, A. (1989) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 86, 7819-7822). In this study, the effect of trimming of sugar chains on the biological activity in vitro of this hormone was examined by using several glycosidases. Human erythropoietin produced by recombinant Chinese hamster ovary cells showed three times higher activity after desialylation. The activity was not changed significantly by further removal of the mucin-type sugar chain from the hormone, indicating no contribution of this type of sugar chain to the activity of erythropoietin in vitro. Sequential removal of galactose and N-acetylglucosamine from the outer chain moieties of the desialylated Asn-type sugar chains raised the activity of the hormone up to four and five times the intact erythropoietin, respectively. The activation effect was diminished slightly by further removing alpha-mannosyl residues and to a great extent by removing beta-mannosyl residues from the core portions of the Asn-type sugar chains. N-Glycanase digestion of intact erythropoietin resulted in almost complete loss of the activity in vitro. These results indicate that the core portion of the Asn-type sugar chains is necessary for erythropoietin to express its full biological activity in vitro and suggest that removal of the core portion of the sugar chains destroys the active conformation of erythropoietin."

https://openalex.org/W1576034245,"Apolipoprotein B (apoB) 48 mRNA is the product of a C----U conversion of the first base of the codon CAA for Gln-2153 in apoB-100 mRNA, changing it to an in-frame stop codon (UAA). Methods for measuring the ratio of apoB-48 to apoB-100 mRNA that have been authenticated with standard mixtures of the two apoB mRNA species have not been described. Using RNA mixtures consisting of known proportions of in vitro transcripts of apoB-100 and apoB-48, we directly compared four different assays. We found that a procedure based on the polymerase chain reaction, cDNA cloning, and oligonucleotide colony hybridization was the most sensitive and accurate assay. Total RNAs isolated from adult rat small intestine, adult liver, Day 15 and term placentas, and term fetal membranes were found to contain apoB mRNA in the following relative amounts: 100, 59.8, 0.9, 6.96, and 1087, respectively. They all contained both apoB-48 and apoB-100 mRNAs, with the former constituting 95.8, 59.2, 4.6, 1.3, and 0.8%, respectively, of the apoB mRNA. We examined the ontogeny of apoB-48 mRNA biogenesis in the liver and intestine in the rat prenatally on Days 17, 19, and 20 of gestation, and postnatally on Days 1, 3, 7, 13, 20, 24, and 37 after birth. Slot-blot hybridization demonstrated that apoB mRNA showed a peak at birth (Days 1-3 in the liver and Days 1-7 in the small intestine) and then decreased on Days 7 (in the liver) and 13 (in the intestine) before it increased again on Day 20 toward the adult level. Quantitation of the ratio of apoB-48 to apoB-100 mRNA at the different time points showed that RNA editing became highly competent prenatally on Day 19 of gestation in the small intestine, but postnatally on Day 24 after birth in the liver. The asynchronous nature for this developmentally regulated process in the liver and small intestine of the rat has implications for the mechanism of RNA editing and lipid homeostasis in this animal."
https://openalex.org/W1482717646,"The repA gene product of the promiscuous plasmid pLS1 is a 45-amino acid repressor protein. The plasmid initiator of replication protein, RepB, is encoded by the repB gene which is situated downstream of repA. The results presented here demonstrate that both genes constitute a transcriptional unit. We show that the repA gene product inhibits transcription from the repAB promoter both in vitro and in vivo. By hydroxyl radical footprinting on both DNA strands, we show that RepA binds specifically to a plasmid region in which a 13-base pair element, showing a 2-fold rotational symmetry, is located. Within this symmetric element lies the -35 region of the repAB promoter. RepA binds into successive major grooves along one face of the DNA helix. The general architecture of RepA and of its interactions with DNA resembles that of the Cro repressor proteins of bacteriophages lambda and 434. We propose that RepA regulates the plasmid copy number by binding to its own promoter, thus controlling the synthesis of the plasmid initiator of replication protein."
https://openalex.org/W1484234721,"The extent of protein N-glycosylation in Leishmania mexicana amazonensis has been proposed to be a factor in the virulence of the parasite. The N-linked oligosaccharides of gp63, the major surface glycoprotein of L. mexicana amazonensis, were characterized after their release by hydrazinolysis, re-N-acetylation, and reduction with NaB3H4. High voltage paper electrophoresis of the reduced oligosaccharides revealed only neutral species. Gel-permeation chromatography on Bio-Gel P-4 yielded four fractions, and the oligosaccharides present were structurally characterized by sequential exoglycosidase digestion, fragmentation by acetolysis, and methylation analysis. Four major structures were found and were biantennary oligomannose type with compositions of Glc1Man6GlcNAc2 (La), Man6GlcNAc2 (Lb), Man5GlcNAc2 (Lc), and Man4GlcNAc2 (Ld). The largest oligosaccharide (La) was shown to contain a terminal glucopyranosyl residue on the alpha (1----3) arm. The biantennary oligomannose structures (Lb and Lc) and the glucosylated structure Glc1Man6GlcNAc2 (La) have not previously been reported as a component of a mature glycoprotein from any source."
https://openalex.org/W1505504761,"We have used resonance Raman spectroscopy to study 11 distal pocket mutants and the wild type and native ferric sperm whale myoglobin. The characteristic Raman core-size markers v4, v3, v2, and v10 are utilized to assign the spin and coordination state of each sample. It is demonstrated that replacements of the distal and proximal histidines can discriminate against H2O as a sixth ligand and favor a pentacoordinate Fe3+ atom. Soret absorption band blueshifts are correlated with the pentacoordinate heme environment. One E7 replacement (Arg) leads to an iron spin state change and produces a low spin species. The Glu and Ala mutations at position E11 leave the protein's spin and coordination unaltered. A laser-induced photoreduction effect is observed in all pentacoordinate mutants and seems to be correlated with the loss of the heme-bound water molecule."
https://openalex.org/W2057525371,"In situ hybridization histochemistry reveals localized expression of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) α2 subunit mRNA restricted to the lateral spiriform nucleus cleus (SpL) of the chick diencephalon. The α2 nAChR transcripts are not detected in immature SpL neurons at 4.5-5 days of embryonic development. They begin to accumulate in the SpL at embryonic day 11 and increase until the newborn stage. Specific α2 cDNA amplification by the polymerase chain reaction shows that during this period, the absolute content of α2 mRNA increases about 20-fold. The expression of the α2 nAChR gene is thus developmentally regulated and appears concomitant with the entry of cholinergic fibers into the SpL, as demonstrated by choline acetyltransferase immunohistochemistry."
https://openalex.org/W1542200324,"The gene encoding human fast skeletal muscle troponin C (TnC) was cloned, mapped, and sequenced. The locations of intron positions in this gene were compared to those in the related genes for mouse slow skeletal TnC and vertebrate and nonvertebrate calmodulins. We detected strikingly similar purine-rich DNA sequences on the coding strand in the basal promoter of the genes for fast and slow troponin C and chicken calmodulin II which may represent conserved regulatory elements in genes of the vertebrate troponin C/calmodulin gene family. We mapped the transcriptional start site of the gene and analyzed the expression of TnC test genes in the myogenic cell lines C2, L8, and H9c2(2-1) and in the human fibroblast line HuT12. Constructs comprising 4.7 or 6.2 kilobase pairs of 5'-flanking sequence (including the genuine transcriptional start site) upstream of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene as reporter expressed the hybrid gene in C2 cells but not in nonmuscle cells. Surprisingly, no expression was found in cell lines L8 and H9c2(2-1) despite the fact that all three muscle cell lines vigorously express the endogenous TnC fast mRNA after differentiation. The discrepancy between the expression of endogenous genes and the test gene in these cell lines indicates different requirements for regulatory elements in different myogenic cells."
https://openalex.org/W1554236013,"Data are presented which document the first known effect of retinoic acid on progesterone receptor (PR) gene expression. Treatment of T-47D human breast cancer cells with retinoic acid for 48 h resulted in a marked concentration-dependent decrease in the level of PR mRNA and immunoreactive protein which was similar to the known effect of progestins on these parameters. Retinoic acid, however, did not bind to PR, nor did it cause the previously demonstrated increase in PR molecular weight observed after progestin exposure. When T-47D cells were treated with retinoic acid for 6 h rather than 48 h, no reduction in the level of PR protein was noted at any retinoic acid concentration whereas the effects of retinoic acid on PR mRNA at 6 and 48 h were the same. Examination of the time course of the effects of retinoic acid revealed a rapid decrease in PR mRNA levels detectable 1 h after and maximal 6 h after treatment of T-47D cells with retinoic acid. These effects of retinoic acid contrasted with previously demonstrated progestin effects on PR mRNA which were not apparent until 3 h after and were not maximal until 12 h after treatment. As expected, the PR protein concentration was unaffected for at least 6 h but was maximally decreased 24-48 h after retinoic acid treatment. In summary, retinoic acid treatment of T-47D cells caused a decrease in the cellular PR concentration by decreasing levels of receptor mRNA and protein, suggesting that retinoic acid is capable of modulating sensitivity to progestins in human breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1481050127,"Liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 readily N-dealkylates N,N-dimethylamides. N-Methyl-N-hydroxymethyl amides were isolated as intermediates and characterized by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as their trimethylsilyl ethers. Intramolecular kinetic deuterium isotope effects measured for the enzymic N-demethylation of a series of 12 aromatic and aliphatic N-methyl-N-trideuteriomethyl amides, RCON(CH3)CD3, varied from 3.6 to 6.9 but were independent of both amide bond rotation rate and substrate oxidation potential. These values, which represent a lower limit to the intrinsic isotope effect (Dkintrinsic), are significantly larger than those observed for anodic N-demethylation and are consistent with a mechanism involving hydrogen atom abstraction. On the other hand, with N,N-dimethylbenzamide the intermolecular kinetic deuterium isotope effects on Vmax and Vmax/Km were found to be much smaller (1.23 and 1.75, respectively) indicating substantial suppression of the intrinsic isotope effect. Such suppression indicates the occurrence of a rate-limiting step other than the isotopically sensitive step together with a strong commitment to catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2142342649,"Lysosomal membrane vesicles isolated from rat liver were exploited to analyze the mechanism of glucose transport across the lysosomal membrane. Uptake kinetics of [14C]D-glucose showed a concentration-dependent saturable process, typical of carrier-mediated facilitated transport, with a Kt of about 75 mM. Uptake was unaffected by Na+ and K+ ions, membrane potentials, and proton gradients but showed an acidic pH optimum. Lowering the pH from 7.4 to 5.5 had no effect on the affinity of the carrier for the substrate but increased the maximum rate of transport about 3-fold. As inferred from the linearity of Scatchard plots, a single transport mechanism could account for the uptake of glucose under all conditions tested. As indicated by the transstimulation properties of the carrier, other neutral monohexoses, including D-galactose, D-mannose, D- and L-fucose were transported by this carrier. The transport rates and affinities of these sugars, measured by the use of their radiolabeled counterparts, were in the same range as those for D-glucose. Pentoses, sialic acid, and other acidic monosaccharides including their lactones, aminosugars, N-acetyl-hexosamines, and most L-stereoisomers, particularly those not present in mammalian tissues, were not transported by this carrier. Glucose uptake and transstimulation were inhibited by cytochalasin B and phloretin. The biochemical properties of this transporter differentiate it from other well-characterized lysosomal sugar carriers, including those for sialic acid and N-acetylhexosamines. The acidic pH optimum of this glucose transporter is a unique feature not shared with any other known glucose carrier and is consistent with its lysosomal origin."

This matrix is primarily composed of collagen, along with noncollagenous proteins which include glycoproteins and proteoglycans. After various times in culture, human bone cells were labeled with [35S]sulfate, [3H] leucine/proline, or [3H]glucosamine and the metabolism of hyaluronan and four distinct species of proteoglycans (PGs) was assayed in the medium, cell layer, and intracellular pools. These cells produce hyaluronan (Mr approximately 1,400,000; a chondroitin sulfate PG (CSPG), Mr approximately 600,000; a heparan sulfate PG (HSPG), Mr approximately 400,000; and two dermatan sulfate PGs with Mr approximately 270,000 (biglycan, PG I) and Mr approximately 135,000 (decorin, PG II) that distribute between the medium and cell layer. Two days following subculture, 12 h [35S]sulfate steady-state labeling yielded a composition of 24, 27, 31, and 18% for total CSPG, HSPG, biglycan, and decorin, respectively. While HSPG and decorin levels and distribution between medium and cell layer remained relatively constant during steady-state labeling at different times in culture, CSPG and biglycan levels increased dramatically at late stages of growth, and their distribution changed throughout culture. These results were independent of cell density, media depletion, and labeling pool effects. In contrast, hyaluronan synthesis was uncoupled from PG synthesis and apparently density-dependent. Pulse chase labeling at different stages of culture showed that the CSPG and decorin behaved as secretory PGs. Both HSPG and biglycan underwent catabolism, with HSPG possessing a t1/2 of 8 h and biglycan a t1/2 of 4 h. While the rate of HSPG turnover did not appreciably change between early and late culture, that of biglycan decreased. The mRNA for decorin was constant, while that of biglycan changed during culture. These results suggest that each PG possesses a distinct pattern of cellular and temporal distribution that may reflect specific stages in matrix formation and maturation."
https://openalex.org/W1585957774,"A sulfatide-binding site on the globular end region of the long arm of laminin has been identified. Following proteolytic digestion with thermolysin, an intact fragment of the laminin A chain carboxyl-terminal domain exhibiting sulfatide-binding activity was isolated using gel filtration and heparin affinity chromatography. This fragment is composed of two peptides that are covalently linked by at least one disulfide bond and encompass the carboxyl-terminal 394 amino acids of the A chain. The clusters of charged residues in the primary structure of these fragments are sufficient for heparin-binding activity but not sulfatide binding since reduction and alkylation of the fragments abolished sulfatide binding under conditions in which heparin binding was retained. Thus, sulfatide binding requires an intact three-dimensional structure. The iodinated fragment bound to A2058 melanoma and T47D breast carcinoma cells and could be displaced by the unlabeled fragment. Based on incorporation of [35S] sulfate, both cell lines synthesize sulfated glycolipids that bind to laminin. In agreement with previous data that indicate a synergistic interaction of the sulfatide-binding domain with other laminin-binding sites on melanoma cells during attachment, the isolated sulfatide-binding fragment significantly inhibited interaction of labeled intact laminin with melanoma and breast carcinoma cells in direct binding assays."
https://openalex.org/W1675036791,"We have examined the influence of intracellular vitamin B6 concentration on glucocorticoid receptor function in HeLa S3 cells transfected with a glucocorticoid-responsive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid. CAT activity is induced from this plasmid specifically by glucocorticoid hormones in a glucocorticoid receptor-dependent manner. The intracellular concentration of pyridoxal phosphate, the physiologically active form of the vitamin, was elevated by supplementation of the culture medium with the synthesis precursor pyridoxine and lowered by exposure to the pyridoxal phosphate synthesis inhibitor 4-deoxypyridoxine. Analysis of glucocorticoid responsiveness revealed that elevated concentrations of intracellular pyridoxal phosphate suppressed the amount of glucocorticoid-induced CAT activity whereas moderate deficiency enhanced the level of glucocorticoid receptor-mediated gene expression. In contrast, modulation of the intracellular pyridoxal phosphate concentration had no effect on either basal CAT activity derived from cells not stimulated with dexamethasone or on CAT activity derived from two glucocorticoid-insensitive reporter plasmids. The modulatory effects of pyridoxal phosphate concentration occur without changes in glucocorticoid receptor mRNA levels, glucocorticoid receptor protein concentration, or the steroid binding capacity of the receptor. These observations demonstrate that vitamin B6 selectively influences glucocorticoid receptor-dependent gene expression through a novel mechanism that does not involve alterations in glucocorticoid receptor concentration or ligand binding capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1488796712,"A gamma-carboxylation recognition site on the propeptide of the vitamin K-dependent blood coagulation proteins directs the carboxylation of glutamic acid residues by binding to the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase. To determine residues that define this site, we evaluated the effect of mutation of certain residues in the prothrombin propeptide on the extent of carboxylation. The prothrombin cDNA modified by site-specific mutagenesis was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using a system that yields functional fully carboxylated prothrombin. The cell supernatants containing recombinant prothrombin were evaluated for the extent of gamma-carboxylation by immunoassay. Conformation-specific anti-prothrombin:Ca(II)-specific antibodies measure native completely carboxylated prothrombin; anti-prothrombin:total antibodies measure all forms of prothrombin, regardless of gamma-carboxyglutamic acid content. Mutation of His-18 to Gly, Val-17 to Ser, Leu-15 to Gly or Asp, or Ala-10 to Asp was associated with a partial (30-65%) inhibition of gamma-carboxylation. Mutation of Ala-14 to Ser or Ser-8 to Val did not inhibit gamma-carboxylation. From this and earlier work, residues whose mutation leads to a significant impairment of carboxylation include His-18, Val-17, Phe-16, Leu-15, and Ala-10. Residues whose mutation does not alter the carboxylation recognition site include Ala-14, Ser-8, Arg-4, and Arg-1. To determine the size of the recognition site, the in vitro carboxylation of propeptide-containing synthetic peptides was compared. A 28-residue peptide, based upon residues -18 to +10 of prothrombin, and a 54-residue peptide, based upon residues -18 to +36 of prothrombin, were carboxylated by partially purified bovine carboxylase with similar Km values of 2-5 microM. These results indicate that the gamma-carboxyglutamic acid-rich region of prothrombin makes a minimal contribution to carboxylase binding. A molecular surface of about five amino acids located within the propeptide appears to define the carboxylation recognition site on the precursor forms of the vitamin K-dependent proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1591376356,"Two types of linker subunits (linkers 1 and 2) of the extracellular hemoglobin of Tylorrhynchus heterochaetus have been isolated as disulfide-linked homodimers by C18 reverse-phase chromatography. These subunits constituted 6 and 13%, respectively, of total protein area on the chromatogram. The complete amino acid sequences of linkers 1 and 2 were determined by automated Edman sequencing of the peptides derived by digestions with lysyl endopeptidase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease, pepsin, and endoproteinase Asp-N. The linker 1 consisted of 253 amino acid residues (the calculated molecular mass, 28,200 Da), while the linker 2 consisted of 236 residues (26,316 Da). The two chains showed 27% sequence identity. The amino acid sequences of Tylorrhynchus linkers 1 and 2 also showed 23-27% homology with the recently determined sequence of a linker chain of Lamellibrachia hemoglobin (Suzuki, T., Takagi, T., and Ohta, S. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1551-1555). In the three linker chains, half-cystine residues were highly conserved; 8 out of 13 residues are identical, suggesting that such residues would contribute to the formation of intrachain disulfide bonds essential for the protein folding of the linker polypeptides. Based on the exact molecular masses of the linker and the heme-containing subunits, the molar ratios estimated for the subunits and the minimum molecular weights per 1 mol of heme, a model is proposed for the subunit structure of the Tylorrhynchus hemoglobin, consisting of 216 polypeptide chains, 192 heme-containing chains, and 24 linker chains."
https://openalex.org/W2063125299,"The structure of the complex formed between the intercalating agent proflavine and fibrous native DNA was studied by one- and two-dimensional high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Carbon-13-labeled proflavine was used to show that the drug is stacked with the aromatic ring plane perpendicular to the fiber axis and that it is essentially immobile. Natural abundance carbon-13 NMR of the DNA itself shows that proflavine binding does not change the puckering of the deoxyribose ring. However, phosphorus-31 NMR spectra show profound changes in the orientation of the phosphodiester grouping on proflavine binding, with some of the phosphodiesters tilting almost parallel to the helix axis, and a second set almost perpendicular. The first group to the phosphodiesters probably spans the intercalation sites, whereas the tilting of the second set likely compensates for the unwinding of the DNA by the intercalator."
https://openalex.org/W1533208788,"Protein N-methylation is a widespread modification whose functions are poorly understood. To overcome the inherent technical difficulties in identification of N-methylated proteins, we cultured PC12 cells with a methylation inhibitor, in expectation that proteins would accumulate in a hypomethylated state. Cell extracts were then incubated with [methyl-3H]S-adenosyl-L-methionine to label methyl-accepting sites via endogenous methyltransferases. Using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis we detected over 50 methyl acceptors, ranging from 18 to 120 kDa. Most had isoelectric points greater than 7.0. NG,NG-Dimethylarginine and NG-monomethylarginine accounted for about 90% of the methyl-3H-amino acids recovered after acid hydrolysis and thin-layer chromatography. The production of hypomethylated proteins should prove useful, not only in the identification of new methyl acceptors, but also in the isolation and characterization of new methyltransferases."
https://openalex.org/W1558402642,"Serine hydroxymethyltransferase and the trifunctional enzyme C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase have been purified to near homogeneity from L1210 cells. Kinetic constants (Km and kcat) have been determined for both folate and non-folate substrates. The effect of increasing glutamate chain length on affinity and catalytic efficiency were determined for the four activities. The studies show that the structural and catalytic properties of the two L1210 enzymes are very similar to the corresponding enzymes purified from rabbit liver. Antibodies to both rabbit serine hydroxymethyltransferase and C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase cross-react with the corresponding L1210 enzymes. The intracellular concentration of active sites of serine hydroxymethyltransferase and C1-tetrahydrofolate synthase in L1210 cells are both 9 microM. The combined concentration of these two enzymes exceeds the previously reported concentration of 10 microM for total intracellular folates. A network thermodynamic computer model of one carbon metabolism (Seither, R. L., Trent, D. F., Mikulecky, D. C., Rape, T. J., and Goldman, I. D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17016-17023) suggests that complete inhibition of cytosolic serine hydroxymethyltransferase would neither significantly decrease the rates of biosynthesis of purines and thymidylate nor significantly alter the rate of interconversion of tetrahydrofolate cofactors to dihydrofolate with subsequent inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase."
https://openalex.org/W1492241472,We report here the identification and nucleotide sequence of two transcription termination regions associated with the murine adenosine deaminase gene. One region is situated within or very near exon one and in mouse fibroblasts accounts for more than a 50-fold drop in the abundance of nascent transcripts. This termination region is believed to be involved in the regulation of adenosine deaminase gene transcription. The other termination region is located approximately 3.5 kilobases beyond the major polyadenylation site and defines the 3' boundary of the adenosine deaminase transcription unit.
https://openalex.org/W2121463009,"The effect of methanol on the folding of staphylococcal nuclease has been investigated. Equilibrium thermal unfolding transitions were monitored by fluorescence emission. The transition was very sensitive to the presence of methanol (at pH 7.0), the Tm decreased from above 50 degrees C for aqueous solution to below 0 degree C for 70% methanol. The transitions were fully reversible and conformed to two-state behavior. A linear relationship was observed between the hydrophobicity of the solvent and both the Tm and the change in delta G for unfolding. The effect of pH on the transition in 50% methanol at 0 degree C was essentially the same as for aqueous solution, with a cooperative transition in the vicinity of apparent pH (pH*) 4. The unfolding transition was determined as a function of guanidine thiocyanate in aqueous and 50% methanol solvents. The midpoints of the transitions were 0.30 and 0.20 M, respectively, at 2.1 degrees C. The kinetics of folding at 0 degree C were compared in aqueous, 50% methanol and 0.30 M guanidine thiocyanate solvents, by monitoring changes in the tryptophan fluorescence intensity. Triphasic kinetics for refolding in both aqueous and 50% methanol solutions were observed in stopped-flow experiments. In both solvent systems the slowest phase is ascribed to proline isomerization. The kinetics of refolding were monitored at subzero temperatures in 50% methanol at pH* 7.0 in manual mixing experiments. Biphasic kinetics were observed at temperatures between 0 and -35 degrees C. A third, faster phase, was inferred from the missing amplitude. The energies of activation were 20.0 and 17.2 kcal mol-1, respectively, for the two slower phases. At -33.8 degrees C, the observed pseudo first-order rate constants were 1.2 x 10(-3) and 2.1 x 10(-5) s-1. At temperatures above -35 degrees C, the sum of the observed amplitudes was essentially constant at 70-75% of the expected total amplitude. At lower temperatures the amplitude of the refolding reaction decreased, and the native state was not formed (unless the temperature was increased), due to the formation of a trapped intermediate state. This intermediate has circular dichroism and fluorescence properties consistent with a compact state with some molten globule characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W1504325643,"Two structurally distinct ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) occur in different developmental stages of malaria parasites. One point at which the transition from one type to the other is found shortly after sporozoites invade hepatocytes, the first stage of parasite development in the mammalian host. The invasion in itself appears necessary but insufficient to trigger the rRNA transition. The progression of events involved in the synthesis of a new type ribosome is tied to the fate of the invading parasite. Interestingly, the switch also occurs in irradiated sporozoites. The new rRNAs produced are processed to the mature size, indicating that rRNA transcription and processing remain normal in the attenuated parasites. These results have implications for monitoring antimalaria vaccine candidates and drug efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2012787015,"The Drosophila Shaker (Sh) gene encodes a family of voltage-gated K+ channels. Mutant alleles of Sh alter the currents expressed from these channels in a variety of ways. To identify the molecular basis of these alterations, Sh transcript sequences were amplified using the polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription of mutant RNA. Amplified products from each mutant were cloned and sequenced. Two alleles, Sh102 and Sh5, had single base substitutions in the central conserved region shared by all Sh channels. RNA synthesized in vitro from a cDNA construct carrying the Sh5 mutation was injected into Xenopus oocytes. Currents expressed by the mutant RNA were altered in their voltage dependence of activation and inactivation, similar to the alterations in Sh currents recorded from different preparations of Sh5 fly tissue. The changes in current properties and the location of the mutation are consistent with the participation of a novel region of the channel in voltage gating."
https://openalex.org/W1540833582,"The nuclear lamina of surf clam oocytes contains dimers of 67-kDa lamin which are stabilized by both noncovalent interactions and disulfide bonds. The latter can be reduced but re-form when the reducing agent is removed. The cysteine residues involved in these disulfide bonds are inaccessible to alkylating agents unless the protein is unfolded in urea. During nuclear envelope breakdown the lamin is released as a mixture of oligomers in which disulfide-stabilized dimers are associated noncovalently with lamin monomers. Concurrent with solubilization, both dimers and monomers are phosphorylated to a similar extent, indicating that the interactions which maintain these complexes are not destabilized by lamin phosphorylation. Our results suggest the existence of two types of interactions between the lamin molecules in the polymer, which react differently to phosphorylation during nuclear envelope breakdown."
https://openalex.org/W1542867289,"To further understand the packing of amphipathic alpha-helices of apolipoproteins in serum lipoproteins, we have investigated the interactions with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) of a 13C-labeled, 18-residue peptide (18A) which can form an amphipathic alpha-helix. This peptide whose amino acid sequence is DWLKAFYDKVAEKLKEAF has the positive-negative residue clustering typical of the apolipoprotein class of amphipathic helix. 13CH3-alanine was introduced as the 11th residue of 18A so that the 13CH3 group protrudes on the apolar side of the amphipathic helix. [13C]NMR spectra of [13C-Ala11]18A in discoidal complexes with DMPC show three resonances from the Ala-13CH3 group; one originates from 18A in aqueous solution, while those at chemical shifts (delta) of 15.2 and 16.4 ppm are assigned to 18A in the and faces, respectively, of the discoidal complex. The proportion of 18A in the faces of the discoidal complex increases as the size of the disk is increased by raising the lipid/peptide ratio. 18A covers the edge of the disk so that the 13CH3-Ala side chain from these molecules is in contact with DMPC acyl chains. [13C-Ala11]18A bound to the surface of an egg PC small unilamellar vesicle gives a single resonance from 18A at delta 16.3 ppm consistent with there being no edge location. Cooling 18A-DMPC disks to 15 degrees C crystallizes the DMPC bilayer and restricts the motion of the 13CH3-Ala group of the 18A molecules. The molecular motions of the side chains of the amphipathic helix are sensitive to their location in the disk and to PC molecular packing."
https://openalex.org/W1572845255,"Pseudomonas putida and Azotobacter vinelandii ferredoxins each contain one [4Fe-4S] cluster and one [3Fe-4S] cluster. Their polypeptide chains are nearly identical, differing by only 15 residues out of a total of 106. T1 measurements and temperature dependence studies of the 1H NMR spectrum of each ferredoxin demonstrate that all six resolved downfield resonances are near an iron-sulfur center. The five most downfield resonances are shown to arise from protons on cysteinyl beta-carbons by incorporation of cysteine deuterated at the beta-carbon into cell protein. The sixth peak (10.5 ppm) is shown to be a non-cysteinyl proton. This peak resolves into two resonances of approximately equal intensity at temperatures below 15 degrees or above 25 degrees C. A nuclear Overhauser effect observed between the two downfield-most resonances of A. vinelandii ferredoxin indicates that they originate from a geminal pair of beta-cysteinyl protons. An Overhauser effect observed between the resonances at 22.3 and 15.7 ppm, in conjunction with other results, implies that the resonance at 22.3 ppm arises from a beta-proton on the 3Fe-center-bound Cys16, while the resonance at 15.7 ppm arises from Cys45 beta-proton, which is bound to the 4Fe center. The five most downfield resonances are pH-dependent. The sixth peak (10.5 ppm in P. putida ferredoxin) is pH-independent. Possible origins for the observed pH dependencies are discussed."

All of these introns are inserted 3' to the anticodon position in these genes. We have designed polymerase chain reaction primers that can amplify all of the tRNA(Tyr) genes for cloning and sequencing by using the conserved portions of the gene coding for the structural part of the tRNA. Our preliminary results have revealed five tRNA(Tyr) genes, each of which contains a different intron. We used the same technique to amplify, clone, and sequence the human genes for tRNA(Leu)CAA. This has resulted in the discovery that this human tRNA gene family also has introns inserted 3' to the anticodon. This polymerase chain reaction technique is useful in detecting new families of intron-containing tRNA genes as well as identifying sequence variations in the introns of individual genes."
https://openalex.org/W1516277202,"In the process of lipoprotein lipolysis, masses of fatty acid are generated at the surface of the lipoprotein. The newly generated fatty acid may at least partly redistribute from the site of lipolysis to phospholipid-rich membranes and to albumin. We have studied the distribution of [1-13C]oleic acid in model systems consisting of chylomicron-like triacylglycerol-rich emulsions, unilamellar phosphatidylcholine vesicles, and bovine serum albumin. By using high resolution 13C NMR spectroscopy it was possible to distinguish fatty acid in each compartment (emulsion, vesicle, albumin) and quantitate the fatty acid distribution under various conditions of lipid compartment concentration and aqueous pH. When emulsions and vesicles were present in equivalent mass amounts, fatty acid exhibited a profound preference for the lipid bilayers. The release of oleic acid to phospholipid bilayers was presumably also a function of its high molar stoichiometry (5:1) with the albumin present. More equitable distributions of fatty acid between vesicles and emulsions were seen when higher concentrations of emulsion were used. The distribution of fatty acid between compartments was in good agreement with predictions made using the apparent ionization constant, expressed as pKapp, of 7.5 and the surface to core (phospholipid to triacylglycerol) distribution coefficient of 7.0, measured for unionized oleic acid in chylomicron particles (Spooner, P. J. R., Bennett Clark, S., Gantz, D. L., Hamilton, J. A., and Small, D. M. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 1444-1455). These results indicate that the affinities of fatty acid for phospholipid bilayer and chylomicron-like emulsion surfaces are equivalent. Redistribution of lipolytically generated fatty acid from chylomicron surface to cell membrane may simply be driven by the predominant quantity of the cell membrane surfaces."
