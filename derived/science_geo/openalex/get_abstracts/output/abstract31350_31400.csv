https://openalex.org/W1986232581,"Virusoids are circular single-stranded RNAs dependent on plant viruses for replication and encapsidation. Virusoid replication appears to involve longer-than-unit-length plus and minus RNAs, indicating that unit-length plus RNA is generated by specific cleavage reactions. Here, we synthesize plus and minus partial-length RNAs of the 324-nucleotide virusoid from lucerne transient streak virus in vitro. Both RNAs self-cleave at a unique site in the presence of magnesium ions to give 5' hydroxyl and 2',3' cyclic phosphodiester termini. Conformations other than the native structures are necessary for cleavage. Similar secondary structures with considerable sequence homology are proposed for the active sites of these and other plant pathogenic RNAs. Our results are consistent with certain rolling-circle replication models."

https://openalex.org/W1992785510,"GAP-43 is one of a small subset of cellular proteins selectively transported by a neuron to its terminals. Its enrichment in growth cones and its increased levels in developing or regenerating neurons suggest that it has an important role in neurite growth. A complementary DNA (cDNA) that encodes rat GAP-43 has been isolated to study its structural characteristics and regulation. The predicted molecular size is 24 kilodaltons, although its migration in SDS-polyacrylamide gels is anomalously retarded. Expression of GAP-43 is limited to the nervous system, where its levels are highest during periods of neurite outgrowth. Nerve growth factor or adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate induction of neurites from PC12 cells is accompanied by increased GAP-43 expression. GAP-43 RNA is easily detectable, although at diminished levels, in the adult rat nervous system. This regulation of GAP-43 is concordant with a role in growth-related processes of the neuron, processes that may continue in the mature animal."
https://openalex.org/W2010491659,"Guanine nucleotide binding (G) proteins (subunit composition alpha beta gamma) dissociate on activation with guanosine triphosphate (GTP) analogs and magnesium to give alpha-guanine nucleotide complexes and free beta gamma subunits. Whether the opening of potassium channels by the recently described Gk in isolated membrane patches from mammalian atrial myocytes was mediated by the alpha k subunit or beta gamma dimer was tested. The alpha k subunit was found to be active, while the beta gamma dimer was inactive in stimulating potassium channel activity. Thus, Gk resembles Gs, the stimulatory regulatory component of adenylyl cyclase, and transducin, the regulatory component of the visual system, in that it regulates its effector function--the activity of the ligand-gated potassium channel--through its guanine nucleotide binding subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1560226916,"The high affinity ryanodine receptor of the Ca2+ release channel from junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum of rabbit skeletal muscle has been identified and characterized using monoclonal antibodies. Anti-ryanodine receptor monoclonal antibody XA7 specifically immunoprecipitated [3H]ryanodine-labeled receptor from digitonin-solubilized triads in a dose-dependent manner. [3H]Ryanodine binding to the immunoprecipitated receptor from unlabeled digitonin-solubilized triads was specific, Ca2+-dependent, stimulated by millimolar ATP, and inhibited by micromolar ruthenium red. Indirect immunoperoxidase staining of nitrocellulose blots of various skeletal muscle membrane fractions has demonstrated that anti-ryanodine receptor monoclonal antibody XA7 recognizes a high molecular weight protein (approximately 350,000 Da) which is enriched in isolated triads but absent from light sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles and transverse tubular membrane vesicles. Thus, our results demonstrate that monoclonal antibodies to the approximately 350,000-Da junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum protein immunoprecipitated the ryanodine receptor with properties identical to those expected for the ryanodine receptor of the Ca2+ release channel."

https://openalex.org/W2027583210,"The ability to express the genes of pathogenic human viruses, such as the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) virus (also called human immunodeficiency virus) in bacterial cells affords the opportunity to study proteins that are ordinarily difficult or inconvenient to obtain in amounts sufficient for detailed analysis. A segment of the AIDS virus pol gene was expressed in Escherichia coli. Expression resulted in the appearance of reverse transcriptase activity in the bacterial cell extracts. The extracts contained two virus-related polypeptides that have the same apparent molecular weights as the two processed forms of virion-derived reverse transcriptase (p66 and p51). The formation of these two polypeptides depended on the coexpression of sequences located near the 5' end of the pol gene, a region that is thought to encode a viral protease. This bacterial system appears to generate mature forms of the AIDS virus reverse transcriptase by a proteolytic pathway equivalent to that which occurs during virus infection of human cells."
https://openalex.org/W1551929310,"KB cells respond to insulin and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in a closely similar way (induction of membrane ruffling, stimulation of pinocytosis, and amino acid transport) but respond to epidermal growth factors (EGF) in a similar but distinct way. In the KB cells, using phosphotyrosine-specific antibody we have found that: the receptors for insulin (beta subunit), IGF-I (beta subunit), and EGF undergo tyrosine phosphorylation as early as 10 s after addition of their respective ligands; a 185-kDa protein is rapidly (less than 10 s) tyrosine phosphorylated by insulin and IGF-I through their respective receptor kinases but not EGF; tyrosine phosphorylation of a 190-kDa glycoprotein is rapidly (less than 10 s) induced by EGF through EGF receptor kinase; and tyrosine phosphorylation of a 240-kDa protein is stimulated within 30 s by all three growth factors. These patterns of tyrosine phosphorylation could be causally related to biological responses induced by the three growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1495232868,"The effects of glucose, diazoxide, K+, and tolbutamide on the activity of K+ channels, membrane potential, and cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration were investigated in beta-cells from the Uppsala colony of obese hyperglycemic mice. With [K+]e = [K+]i = 146 mM, it was demonstrated that the dominating channel at the resting potential is a K+ channel with a single-channel conductance of about 65 picosiemens and a reversal potential of about +70 mV (pipette potential). This channel is characterized by complex kinetics with openings grouped in bursts. The channel was completely inhibited by 20 mM glucose in intact cells or by intracellularly applied Mg-ATP (1 mM). The number of active channels was markedly reduced already by 5 mM glucose. However, the single channel current of the channels remaining active was unaffected, indicating no major depolarization. To evoke a substantial depolarization of the membrane and thereby action potentials, a total block in channel activity was necessary. This could be achieved either by increasing the concentration of glucose to 20 mM or by combining 5 mM glucose with 100 microM tolbutamide. In both cases, the effect was counteracted by the hyperglycemic sulfonamide diazoxide. The effects on single channel activity were paralleled by changes in membrane potential and cytoplasmic free Ca2+ concentration, also when the latter measurements were performed at room temperature. The transient increase in the number of active channels and the resulting hyperpolarization observed after raising the glucose concentration to 20 mM probably reflected a drop in cytoplasmic ATP concentration. It is suggested that ATP works as a key regulator of the beta-cell membrane potential and thereby the opening of voltage-activated Ca2+ channels."
https://openalex.org/W1974846950,"Whole-cell and single-channel voltage-clamp techniques were used to identify and characterize the channels underlying the fast transient potassium current (A current) in cultured myotubes and neurons of Drosophila. The myotube (A1) and neuronal (A2) channels are distinct, differing in conductance, voltage dependence, and gating kinetics. The myotube currents have a faster and more voltage-dependent macroscopic inactivation rate, a larger steady-state component, and a less negative steady-state inactivation curve than the neuronal currents. The myotube channels have a conductance of 12 to 16 picosiemens, whereas the neuronal channels have a conductance of 5 to 8 picosiemens. In addition, the myotube channel is affected by Shaker mutations, whereas the neuronal channel is not. Together, these data suggest that the two channels are separate molecular structures, the expression of which is controlled, at least in part, by different genes."
https://openalex.org/W1974556710,"Retinal ganglion cells are the projection neurons that link the retina to the brain. Peptide immunoreactive cells in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) of the mammalian retina have been noted but their identity has not been determined1–3. We now report that, in the rabbit, 25–35% of all retinal ganglion cells contain substance P-like (SP) immunoreactivity. They were identified by either retrograde transport of fluorescent tracers injected into the superior colliculus, or by retrograde degeneration after optic nerve section. SP immunoreactive cells are present in all parts of the retina and have medium to large cell bodies with dendrites that ramify extensively in the proximal inner plexiform layer. Their axons terminate in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, superior colliculus and accessory optic nuclei, and these terminals disappear completely after contralateral optic nerve section and/or eye enucleation. In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus large, beaded, immunoreactive axons and varicosities make up a narrow plexus just below the optic tract, where they define a new geniculate lamina. The varicosities make multiple synaptic contacts with dendrites of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus projection neurons and presumptive interneurons in complex glomerular neuropil. This is direct evidence that some mammalian retinal ganglion cells contain substance P-like peptides and strongly suggests that, in the rabbit, substance P (or related tachykinins) may be a transmitter or modulator in a specific population or populations of retinal ganglion cells."
https://openalex.org/W1515103707,"Calcium ions that have been preloaded into isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum subfractions in the presence of ATP and pyrophosphate may be released upon addition of a large number of diverse pharmacologic substances. We report here that not only caffeine, but also Ca2+ ions, thymol, quercetin, menthol, halothane, chloroform, 1-ethyl-2-methylbenzimidazole, ryanodine, tetraphenylboron, ketoconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, W-7, doxorubicin, 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid), p-chloromercuribenzoic acid, and low concentrations of Ag+ induce Ca2+ release from such triadic sarcoplasmic reticulum. All these drugs induce increased undirectional Ca2+ efflux. We believe all these drug-induced Ca2+ releases are mediated by Ca2+ efflux through the same ion channel since these releases are all greatly attenuated when light sarcoplasmic reticulum is substituted for triads and are even more pronounced when transverse tubule-free terminal cisternae are substituted for triads, and all these forms of drug-induced Ca2+ release are inhibited by submicromolar concentrations of ruthenium red, and by submillimolar concentrations of tetracaine, 9-aminoacridine, and Ba2+, yet they are not affected by nifedipine even at a concentration of 50 microM."
https://openalex.org/W1520040443,"Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels of the aortic cell line A7r5 were studied using 45Ca2+ flux experiments. Ca2+ channels which have been studied belong to the L-type and are very sensitive to inhibitors and activators in the 1,4-dihydropyridine series as well as to (-)desmethoxyverapamil and d-cis-diltiazem. L-type Ca2+ channels in these smooth muscle cells are not affected by cyclic 8-bromo-AMP and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. However, the activity of these channels is strongly depressed after treatment with diacylglycerols (1-oleyl 2-acetylglycerol and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol). Phorbol esters, which like diacylglycerols are well-known activators of protein kinase C (the Ca2+- and phospholipid-dependent enzyme), inhibit 70% of Ca2+ channel activity (K0.5 = 25 nM for phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and K0.5 = 200 nM for phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate). Phorbol esters that are inactive on kinase C are without effect on Ca2+ channel activity. [Arg8]Vasopressin and bombesin, two peptides that are well known for their action on polyphosphoinositide metabolism, inhibit Ca2+ channel activity to the same extent as active phorbol esters (65-70%). Oxytocin has the same type of effect presumably by acting at the V1-receptor. Both effects of [Arg8]vasopressin and oxytocin are suppressed by [1-(beta-mercapto-beta,beta-diethylpropionic acid)4-valine]arginine vasopressin, a specific vasopressin antagonist at the V1-receptor."
https://openalex.org/W71582486,"A demonstration is made of pyrophosphate's use as a precipitating anion in studies of Ca2+ release from isolated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). Not only does pyrophosphate speed up the rate at which Ca2+ can be preloaded into SR, but it also allows the accumulated Ca2+ to be released in response to agents such as caffeine. Because so much Ca2+ can be preloaded into SR with pyrophosphate present, more experiments can be performed with a given amount of SR material, and even rapid Ca2+ release rates (greater than 1 mumol/mg X min) are maintained for many seconds. These rates can easily be quantified using conventional spectrophotometric and isotopic methods, without the need for expensive rapid mixing equipment. Caffeine-induced Ca2+ release is exhibited by triadic and terminal cisterna SR subfractions but not by light SR. Caffeine specifically increases the rate of unidirectional 45Ca2+ efflux. This increased efflux is blocked by ruthenium red at submicromolar concentrations and by tetracaine, 9-aminoacridine, or Ba2+ at submillimolar concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2048888553,"The effects of calcium removal on the voltage-dependent potassium channels of isolated squid neurons were studied with whole cell patch-clamp techniques. When the calcium ion concentration was lowered from 10 to 0 millimolar (that is, no added calcium), potassium channel activity, identified from its characteristic time course, disappeared within a few seconds and there was a parallel increase in resting membrane conductance and in the holding current. The close temporal correlation of the changes in the three parameters suggests that potassium channels lose their ability to close in the absence of calcium and simultaneously lose their selectivity. If potassium channels were blocked by barium ion before calcium ion was removed, the increases in membrane conductance and holding current were delayed or prevented. Thus calcium is an essential cofactor in the gating of potassium channels in squid neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1504494544,"The P0 protein is a major structural glycoprotein of molecular weight 28,000 in peripheral nerve myelin. The complete amino acid sequence of bovine P0 protein was determined. The polypeptide chain consists of 219 amino acid residues and includes a highly hydrophobic domain (residues 125-150) in the middle, which probably represents a transmembrane segment. The amino terminal domain (residues 1-124) is relatively hydrophobic, but contains a negatively charged carbohydrate chain at Asn93. This domain is most likely located on the extracellular side of the membrane and may contribute to formation of the myelin intraperiod line by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. On the other hand, the basic carboxyl-terminal domain (residues 151-219) may protrude from the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is probably involved together with basic proteins in the formation of the major myelin dense line through electrostatic interaction with acidic lipids in the membrane. The few interspecies amino acid variations between the bovine P0 and the rat P0 sequences, deduced from the cDNA (Lemke, G., and Axel, R. (1985) Cell 40, 501-508), indicate that the P0 protein is conserved across species."
https://openalex.org/W1981941073,"The mechanisms underlying the ontogeny of voltage-gated ion channels in muscle are unknown. Whether expression of voltage-gated channels is dependent on mitogen withdrawal and growth arrest, as is generally true for the induction of muscle-specific gene products, was investigated in the BC3H1 muscle cell line by patch-clamp techniques. Differentiated BC3H1 myocytes expressed functional Ca2+ and Na+ channels that correspond to those found in T tubules of skeletal muscle. However, Ca2+ and Na+ channels were first detected after about 5 days of mitogen withdrawal. In order to test whether cellular oncogenes, as surrogates for exogenous growth factors, could prevent the expression of ion channels whose induction was contingent on mitogen withdrawal, BC3H1 cells were modified by stable transfection with oncogene expression vectors. Expression vectors containing v-erbB, or c-myc under the control of the SV40 promoter, delayed but did not prevent the appearance of functional Ca2+ and Na+ channels. In contrast, transfection with a Val12 c-H-ras vector, or cotransfection of c-myc together with v-erbB, suppressed the formation of functional Ca2+ and Na+ channels for greater than or equal to 4 weeks. Potassium channels were affected neither by mitogenic medium nor by transfected oncogenes. Thus, the selective effects of certain oncogenes on ion channel induction corresponded to the suppressive effects of mitogenic medium."
https://openalex.org/W1552044089,"Three major functional characteristics of the insulin receptor are negative cooperativity, down-regulation, and beta-subunit tyrosine kinase activity. To investigate the inter-relationships among these functions we studied four antibodies to the insulin receptor alpha-subunit. These monoclonal antibodies competitively inhibited 125I-insulin binding to the insulin receptor of human IM-9 and HEP-G2 cells. When the antibodies were radiolabeled, insulin competed strongly with two antibodies (MA-10 and MA-51) for binding to the insulin receptor, but competed weakly with the two others (MA-5 and MA-20). Antibodies MA-10 and MA-51, like insulin, accelerated the dissociation of bound 125I-insulin from receptors; in contrast, MA-5 and MA-20 strongly inhibited 125I-insulin dissociation. Antibodies MA-10 and MA-51 induced down-regulation of insulin receptors with a potency similar to that of insulin. In contrast, MA-5 and MA-20 were more potent than insulin. None of the antibodies either alone or in combination influenced autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor beta-subunit. These data indicate, therefore, that two major epitopes can be identified on the alpha-subunit of the insulin receptor by the use of monoclonal antibodies. One epitope, recognized by antibodies MA-10 and MA-51, is close to or near the insulin-binding site and mimics insulin-induced negative cooperatively and down-regulation. The other epitope, recognized by antibodies MA-5 and MA-20, is at some distance from the insulin-binding site, and only mimics down-regulation. These data suggest, therefore, that: negative cooperativity and down-regulation may not be inter-related and both processes are independent of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity."
https://openalex.org/W1602516989,"Abstract Exposure of HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells to calcitriol results in a decrease in steady-state levels of c-myc mRNA and induces cellular differentiation. We have asked whether calcitriol has a direct effect on the transcription of the c-myc gene. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) decreased RNA elongation in a nuclear run-off transcription assay by 4 h after treatment. In the continuous presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3, HL-60 cell transcription of c-myc was decreased by 38% at 4 h and was abolished by 48 h. In contrast, the transcription of beta-actin was not affected by 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. The rate of transcription of c-myc and beta-actin was proportional to the number of nuclei and to time. Furthermore, specific hybridization of c-myc and beta-actin RNA was a linear function of RNA input. After a 48-h treatment, the c-myc/beta-actin ratio was decreased by 80-100% at [32P]RNA inputs ranging from 2 to 20 X 10(6) cpm/ml. These data temporally correlate inhibition of c-myc transcription with decreases in the steady-state levels of c-myc mRNA as assessed by Northern blot analysis. We conclude that the effect of 1,25-(OH)2D3 on c-myc expression occurs at the transcriptional level."

https://openalex.org/W1498493338,"Calcium ions that have been preloaded into isolated SR subfractions in the presence of ATP and pyrophosphate may be released upon addition of a large number of diverse pharmacologic substances in a manner that is effectively blocked by ruthenium red and other organic polyamines. Effective blocking substances include certain antibiotics (neomycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, clindamycin, kanamycin, and tobramycin), naturally occurring polyamines (spermine and spermidine), and a number of basic polypeptides and proteins (polylysine, polyarginine, certain histones, and protamine). These agents have only one feature in common: the presence of several amino groups. Ruthenium red, neomycin, spermine, and protamine all appear to act by blocking SR Ca2+ channels since unidirectional 45Ca2+ efflux from the vesicles is strongly inhibited by these agents. Functions ascribable to the SR Ca2+ pump are largely unaffected by these agents. Since inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is ineffective at inducing Ca2+ release under these conditions, we conclude that these polyamines may directly block SR Ca2+ channels at very low concentrations by a mechanism unrelated to effects on inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production."
https://openalex.org/W1535953073,"The diastereoisomers of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphorothioate, (Sp)-cAMPS and (Rp)-cAMPS, have been previously shown to act as agonists and antagonists, respectively, in the activation of several mammalian cAMP-dependent protein kinases. In an effort to characterize further the involvement of cAMP in the activation of Leydig cell steroidogenesis by lutropin/choriogonadotropin (LH/CG), we examined the effects of these cyclic nucleotide analogues on a clonal strain of cultured murine Leydig tumor cells (designated MA-10). Our results show that (i) (Sp)-cAMPS activates and (Rp)-cAMPS inhibits the isolated cAMP-dependent protein kinase of the MA-10 cells; (ii) both analogues inhibit the isolated cAMP phosphodiesterase(s); (iii) (Sp)-cAMPS activates steroid biosynthesis in intact cells, but (Rp)-cAMPS does not; and (iv) (Rp)-cAMPS is a competitive inhibitor of the activation of steroidogenesis by (Sp)-cAMPS, 8-bromo-cAMP, human CG, cholera toxin, and forskolin. However, (Rp)-cAMPS is a more effective inhibitor when steroidogenesis is activated by (Sp)-cAMPS or 8-bromo-cAMP than when it is activated by human CG, cholera toxin, or forskolin. This difference appears to be related to the combined effects of (Rp)-cAMPS on the cAMP-dependent protein kinases and cAMP phosphodiesterase(s). We conclude that cAMP is a quantitatively important mediator of the activation of steroidogenesis by LH/CG even at low concentrations of hormone where an increase in steroid biosynthesis cannot be easily correlated with increased cAMP accumulation. Thus, our data indicate that if other second messengers are involved in the activation of steroidogenesis by LH/CG, they must do so by acting together with, rather than independently of, cAMP."
https://openalex.org/W2072401575,"Voltage-sensitive calcium channels in different tissues have diverse functional properties. Polyclonal antibodies (PAC-2) against the alpha subunits of purified rabbit skeletal muscle calcium channels immunoprecipitated calcium channels labeled with the dihydropyridine PN200-110 from both skeletal muscle and brain. The immunoreactivity of PAC-2 with the skeletal muscle channel was greater than that with the brain calcium channel and was absorbed only partially by prior treatment with the brain channel. PAC-2 specifically recognized a large peptide in synaptic plasma membranes of rabbit brain with an apparent molecular size of 169,000 daltons. This protein resembles an alpha subunit of the skeletal muscle calcium channel in apparent molecular weight, antigenic properties, and electrophoretic behavior after reduction of disulfide bonds. Thus, the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel of rabbit brain has an alpha subunit that is homologous, but not identical, to those of the skeletal muscle calcium channel. The different functional properties of these two calcium channels may result from minor variations in structurally similar components."
https://openalex.org/W1978752252,"A general strategy is described for the isolation of suppressors of essential genes whose functions are unknown. This strategy was used to analyze the role of 4.5S RNA, an essential RNA of E. coli. In this strategy, the structural gene for 4.5S RNA is fused to the Ptac promoter in such a way that the strain becomes dependent upon inducers of lac for growth. Mutants mapping to fus, the structural gene for protein synthesis elongation factor G, appear as spontaneous, inducer-independent revertants. These mutants alter the intracellular distribution of 4.5S RNA such that it sediments at 70S or greater. Furthermore, the increased sedimentation velocity is sensitive to the antibiotic puromycin. These results show that 4.5S RNA physically associates with the ribosome in performing its essential function, and that this association is mediated by elongation factor G."
https://openalex.org/W2079204352,"In primates, certain areas of the frontal cortex play a role in guiding movements toward visual or auditory objects in space. The projections from auditory centers to the frontal cortex of the bat Pteronotus parnellii were examined because echolocating bats utilize auditory cues to guide their movements in space. An area in the frontal cortex receives a direct projection from a division of the auditory thalamus, the suprageniculate nucleus, which in turn receives input from the anterolateral peri-olivary nucleus, an auditory center in the medulla. This pathway to the frontal cortex bypasses the main auditory centers in the midbrain and cortex and could involve as few as four neurons between the cochlea and the frontal cortex. The auditory cortex is also a major source of input to the frontal cortex. This area of the frontal cortex may link the auditory and motor systems by its projections to the superior colliculus."

https://openalex.org/W1504501988,"The involvement of Na+ and Ca2+ channels in the stimulatory effect of nicotine and cAMP upon proenkephalin A mRNA (mRNA ENK) levels in primary cultures of bovine adrenal chromaffin cells was analyzed. Nicotine (10 microM) caused about a 2-3-fold increase in mRNA ENK which was abolished by the nicotinic receptor antagonist tubocurarine (4 X 10(-7) M), inhibited by the Ca2+ channel antagonist nifedipine (100 nM) abolished by the Ca2+ channel blocker D600 (10 microM), and augmented by the Ca2+ channel agonist BayK 8644 (100 nM). In contrast, blockade of the Na+ channel by tetrodotoxin (1 microM) did not modulate the nicotine-induced increase in mRNA ENK. Incubation of the cells with forskolin (25 microM) and 8-bromo-cAMP (1 mM) also resulted in an increase in mRNA ENK levels that was inhibited by the Ca2+ channel blocker verapamil (50 microM) and nifedipine (100 nM), whereas it was enhanced by BayK 8644 (100 nM). In addition, the effect of forskolin and 8-bromo-cAMP was decreased by the Na+ channel blocker tetrodotoxin (1 microM). These results suggest that the induction of proenkephalin A gene expression by cAMP and nicotine involves the modulation of ion channels. It appears that changes in Ca2+ flux are involved in mediating this induction. The dihydropyridines nifedipine and BayK 8644 and the Ca2+ channel blockers verapamil and D600 all modulate 45Ca uptake. In addition, we show that incubation of the cells with A23187 (10(-7) M), a Ca2+ ionophore, resulted in an increase in mRNA ENK, indicating that changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels may indeed modulate proenkephalin A gene expression. Although it appears that an elevation of mRNA ENK upon nicotinic receptor activation occurs rapidly (an increase could be detected after 2 h incubation), the findings that the rise in mRNA ENK could be abolished by the Ca2+ channel blocker D600 but not affected by tetrodotoxin (1 microM), and that agents such as KCl (20 mM) and veratridine (5 microM) that increase mRNA ENK by activation of voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels do not result in an increase in intracellular cAMP, provide no evidence for a major role of the adenylate cyclase system in the inducing effect of nicotine upon proenkephalin A gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1560160498,"Abstract Human alpha 2-antiplasmin rapidly forms a stable, equimolar complex with either its target enzyme, plasmin, or with trypsin. Perturbation of the inhibitor-trypsin complex results in peptide bond cleavage at the reactive site of the inhibitor with the concomitant release of a small peptide fragment which apparently represents the carboxyl-terminal segment of the inhibitor. Sequence analysis of this fragment, together with that of an overlapping peptide obtained by treatment of native inhibitor with either Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteinase or human neutrophil elastase, yields data which indicate that the reactive site of alpha 2-antiplasmin encompasses a P1-P'1 Arg-Met sequence. However, unlike alpha 1-1-proteinase inhibitor which has a Met residue in the P1-position, oxidation of alpha 2-antiplasmin has no effect on its inhibitory activity toward either plasmin, trypsin, or chymotrypsin, indicating the lesser mechanistic importance of the P'1-residue during enzyme inactivation by this inhibitor."
https://openalex.org/W2076628226,"The mitochondrial DNA of trypanosomes is organized as a network of catenated circular DNA molecules called the kinetoplast. The minicircles of the kinetoplast are 1 kb circular DNA molecules present at 5,000-10,000 copies per network. The maxicircles are 20 kb circular molecules present at 50-100 copies per network. Maxicircles are transcribed and are thus analogous to mitochondrial DNAs. Here we show that, contrary to previous reports, the minicircles of T. brucei are also transcribed. A minicircle transcript of approximately 240 nucleotides is present in bloodstream and insect developmental stages of the parasite, is enriched in purified mitochondrial preparations, and is efficiently synthesized in vitro. The minicircle cDNA overlaps the conserved region of the T. brucei minicircle and is juxtaposed to a 12 base sequence common to all minicircles. These findings indicate that minicircles, in addition to their previously proposed structural role, are transcribed."
https://openalex.org/W1491477100,"The splicing of messenger RNA precursors (pre-mRNA) of eukaryotic cells involves the formation of a branched RNA intermediate known as a RNA lariat. This structure is formed in the first step of the reaction when a cleavage at the 5' splice site generates the 5' exon and a RNA species containing the intron and 3' exon in which the phosphate moiety at the 5' end of the intron is forming a 2'-5' phosphodiester bond with the 2'-hydroxyl moiety of a specific adenine residue near the 3' end of the intron forming a RNA branch with the following structure: -pA2'-pX-3'-pZ-. We have purified a debranching activity approximately 700-fold from the cytosolic fraction of HeLa cells. This activity catalyzes the hydrolysis of the 2'-5' phosphodiester bond of branched RNA structures yielding a 5'-phosphate end and a 2'-hydroxyl group at the branch attachment site. The activity possessed a sedimentation coefficient of 3.5 S. The reaction catalyzed by the purified fraction requires a divalent cation and is optimal at pH 7.0. The purified activity can efficiently hydrolyze triester trinucleotide structures (pY2'-pX-3'-pZ-) prepared by digestion of RNA lariats with nuclease P1. In contrast, a 2' phosphate monoester product (-pG2'-p 3'-pC-), formed by the wheat germ RNA ligase, was not attacked."
https://openalex.org/W1514072291,"Using a radioimmunoassay toward the COOH-terminal region of neurotensin, an immunoreactive and biologically active neurotensin-related peptide (NRP) has been isolated from pepsin-treated fractions of bovine, canine, human, and rat plasma. Bovine NRP was identified as H-Ile-Ala-Arg-Arg-His-Pro-Tyr-Phe-Leu-OH, which is similar in structure to both neurotensin and angiotensin I. Canine and human NRP also had the above amino acid composition, whereas that obtained from rat plasma had valine substituted for isoleucine. At their concentrations in pepsin-treated plasmas (2-6 microM) rat, human and canine NRP were shown to increase vascular permeability when injected intradermally into rats and to release histamine from rat mast cells in vitro. The pure peptides also cross-reacted very effectively at nanomolar concentrations in a radioreceptor assay for neurotensin. The protein(s) which liberated NRP upon pepsin treatment were purified about 7-fold and shown to behave like albumin during sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and high pressure liquid chromatography on muBondapak C4. In addition, the purified preparations were found to react with anti-albumin antisera during immunodiffusion. Although the amino acid sequence of NRP was not found in albumin, a partial sequence homology was noted for NRP and various segments of bovine albumin. Using V8 protease, glutamyl residues were shown to lie within 3-4 amino acids of each end of NRP, as also occurs for the related segments in albumin. These results suggest that a subset of albumin-related protein(s) could serve as precursor(s) to biologically active neurotensin-related peptide(s)."
https://openalex.org/W1576209843,"Manoalide is a marine natural product that has anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative activities and is an irreversible inhibitor of phospholipase A2 and phospholipase C. It is now shown that the compound is a potent inhibitor of Ca2+ mobilization in several cell types. In A431 cells the increase in epidermal growth factor receptor-mediated Ca2+ entry and release from intracellular Ca2+ stores were blocked by manoalide in a time-dependent manner with an IC50 of 0.4 microM. The effect of manoalide on phosphoinositide metabolism, namely the production of inositol monophosphate, did not coincide with its effect on the epidermal growth factor response. In GH# cells, manoalide blocked the thyrotropin-releasing hormone-dependent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores without inhibition of the formation of inositol phosphates from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Manoalide also blocked the K+ depolarization-activated Ca2+ channel in these cells as well as the activation of the channel by Bay K8644 with an IC50 of 1 microM. In addition, manoalide also inhibited the Ca2+ influx induced by concanavalin A in mouse spleen cells in a time- and temperature-sensitive manner with an IC50 of 0.07 microM. However, neither forskolin-activated adenylate cyclase in A431 cells nor the distribution of the potential sensitive dye, 3,3'-dipropylthiodicarbocyanide iodide in GH3 cells was affected by manoalide. Thus, manoalide acts as a Ca2+ channel inhibitor in all cells examined. This action may account for its effects on inflammation and proliferation and may be independent of its effect on phospholipases."
https://openalex.org/W1608580109,"A polyamide-based solid-phase support containing an acid-stable p-(oxymethyl)benzoic acid handle to anchor the COOH-terminal amino acid was utilized in the production of synthetic peptides analogous to amino acid sequences 503-532 from the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope glycoprotein. The resin-bound peptide was used to induce an antibody response to the native form of glycoprotein 120 in both rabbits and mice. This epitope was detected on the surface of HIV-infected cells and was capable of inducing an in vitro neutralizing HIV antibody response. In addition, sera from some individuals exposed to HIV react with this peptide bound to the resin in a solid-phase immunoassay. These data indicate that we have identified a neutralizing antigenic determinant present on the amino-terminal glycoprotein 120 subunits of HIV by utilizing resin-bound synthetic peptides."
https://openalex.org/W2083054572,"Neoplasms produce substances that induce blood vessel formation (angiogenesis). Fractions from ethanol extracts of the Walker 256 carcinoma were isolated by silica column chromatography and C18 reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Two of the isolated fractions induced neovascularization when tested in the rabbit corneal micropocket assay. One of the fractions was identified as nicotinamide by desorption-electron impact mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The second active fraction contained nicotinamide as part of a more complex, as yet unidentified, molecular arrangement. Microgram quantities of commercial nicotinamide induced neovascularization in the corneal micropocket assay and in the chick chorioallantoic membrane assay."
https://openalex.org/W1515244403,"The regulation of cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) by intracellular organelles was studied in permeabilized bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells. Two compartments, with distinct characteristics, were able to pump Ca2+. A first pool, sensitive to ruthenium red and presumably mitochondrial, required respiratory chain substrates to maintain [Ca2+]c around 700 nM. Ca2+ efflux from this compartment was activated by Na+ (ED50 = 5 mM). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) had no effect on this pool. A second nonmitochondrial pool required ATP to lower [Ca2+]c to about 200 nM and released Ca2+ transiently upon addition of IP3. When the two systems were allowed to work simultaneously, the nonmitochondrial pool regulated [Ca2+]c and IP3 released Ca2+ in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50 = 0.6 microM). Under these conditions the mitochondria seemed Ca2+ depleted. Upon repeated stimulations with IP3, a marked attenuation of the response was observed. This phenomenon was due to Ca2+ sequestration by a nonmitochondrial IP3-insensitive pool. Neither dantrolene (200 microM) nor 8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (10 microM) were able to abolish IP3-induced Ca2+ release, though both compounds efficiently inhibited aldosterone production in intact cells stimulated with angiotensin II (10 nM) or K+ (12 mM). These results suggest that in permeabilized adrenal glomerulosa cells: the nonmitochondrial pool is responsible for buffering [Ca2+]c and for releasing Ca2+ in response to IP3; at resting [Ca2+]c levels, the mitochondria appear Ca2+ depleted; when [Ca2+]c rises above their set point, the mitochondria accumulate Ca2+ as a function of [Na+]c; 4) the mitochondria are not involved in the desensitization mechanism of the response to IP3."
https://openalex.org/W1546585642,"Abstract So far, there are no known peptidic effective receptor antagonists of both peripheral and central effects of cholecystokinin (CCK). Here, we describe a synthetic peptide derivative of CCK, t-butyloxycarbonyl-Tyr(SO3-)-Met-Gly-D-Trp-Nle-Asp 2-phenylethyl ester 1 (where Nle is norleucine), which is a potent CCK receptor antagonist. In rat and guinea pig dispersed pancreatic acini, this peptide derivative did not alter amylase secretion, but was able to antagonize the stimulation caused by cholecystokinin-related agonists. It caused a parallel rightward shift in the dose-response curve for the stimulation of amylase secretion with half-maximal inhibition of CCK-8-stimulated amylase release at a concentration of about 0.1 microM. Compound 1 was able to inhibit the binding of labeled CCK-9 (the C-terminal nonapeptide of CCK) to rat and guinea pig pancreatic acini (IC50 = 5 X 10(-8) M) as well as to guinea pig cerebral cortical membranes (IC50 = 5 X 10(-7) M). These results indicate that Compound 1 is a potent competitive CCK receptor antagonist."
https://openalex.org/W1563304549,"Abstract Feeder-cell-independent serially propagating keratinocytes from rat oral mucosa (tongue) dissolved reconstituted type I [3H]collagen fibrils, although rather slowly. Analysis of the conditioned medium from such cultures revealed secretion of a Mr = 65,000 collagenase which remained almost entirely latent in the absence of exogenous protease activity. Addition of trypsin (0.1-1.0 microgram/ml) or plasmin (1.0-4.0 micrograms/ml) resulted in substantial acceleration of the collagenolytic process in stimulated secretion of latent collagenase and, at higher concentrations, in conversion of the latent enzyme to the catalytic form. The keratinocyte collagenase was indistinguishable from interstitial, fibroblast-type collagenases by several criteria including: cleavage of native type I collagen in solution at the characteristic collagenase-sensitive locus at 22 degrees C and dissolution of reconstituted type I collagen fibrils at 35 degrees C; activation by trypsin and by organomercurials and inhibition by Zn2+ and Ca2+ chelators; and cross-reaction with antibody to fibroblast-type procollagenase. Expression of collagenolytic activity in keratinocyte cultures was effectively regulated by cell density. The activity (on a per cell basis) was maximal at 10-20% confluence and was more than 95% contact-inhibited at subconfluent and early confluent densities (2-4 X 10(5)/cm2). Our findings show that mucosal keratinocytes possess a potent enzymatic apparatus for degradation of interstitial collagen fibrils which includes a classical vertebrate collagenase."
https://openalex.org/W1538205738,"A putative Ca2+ channel protein was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle transverse tubules with the combined use of lectin affinity chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography, followed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The major component of the purified preparation detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis was a protein of 150 kDa when reduced with 20 mM dithiothreitol and a 191-kDa protein when treated with 20 mM N-ethylmaleimide. Therefore, this protein appears to be identical with the alpha subunit previously described (Curtis, B. M., and Catterall, W. A. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 2113-2118). This protein was purified by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis, followed by electroelution and/or electroblotting, and its amino acid composition and NH2-terminal sequence were determined. The NH2-terminal sequence is: NH2-Glu-Pro-Phe-Pro-Ser-Ala-Val-X-Ile-Lys-Ser-X-Val-X-Lys-Met-Gln-."
https://openalex.org/W2061474195,"Mammalian X-chromosome inactivation involves a coordinate shutting down of physically linked genes. Several proposed models require the presence of specific sequences near genes to permit the spread of inactivation into these regions. If such models are correct, one might predict that heterologous genes transferred onto the X chromosome might lack the appropriate signal sequences and therefore escape inactivation. To determine whether a foreign gene inserted into the X chromosome is subject to inactivation, transgenic mice harboring 11 copies of the complete, 17-kilobase chicken transferrin gene on the X chromosome were used. Male mice hemizygous for this insert were bred with females bearing Searle's translocation, an X-chromosome rearrangement that is always active in heterozygous females (the unrearranged X chromosome is inactive). Female offspring bearing the Searle's translocation and the chicken transferrin gene had the same amount of chicken transferrin messenger RNA in liver as did transgenic male mice or transgenic female mice lacking the Searle's chromosome. This result shows that the inserted gene is not subject to X-chromosome inactivation and suggests that the inactivation process cannot spread over 187 kilobases of DNA in the absence of specific signal sequences required for inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W1505196920,"We have examined the effects of base changes at the lariat branch site of a modified adenovirus major late precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA). Replacement of the A residue at the lariat attachment site with a G residue was studied. Incubation of this altered pre-mRNA with nuclear extracts of HeLa cells yielded less spliced mRNA (10-fold) than similar reactions with the wild type pre-mRNA. The intron lariat formed during the reaction with the mutant transcript contained the predominant branch (2'-5' phosphodiester linkage) to an upstream A residue. In contrast, the intron/exon 2 lariat contained the predominant branch to the substituted G residue. These results indicated that detectable spliced RNA was formed when the lariat was attached at the A residue but not when the lariat was attached to the substituted G residue. A second mutation was introduced into the transcript by substituting an additional G residue at the alternative A branch site. When transcript derived from this plasmid was incubated with nuclear extract, cleavage occurred at the 5' splice site, and an intron/exon 2 lariat was produced, but spliced RNA was not detected. T1 RNase digestion and primer extension analyses of this intron/exon 2 lariat revealed that all of the lariat formed on the G residue at the normal attachment site."
https://openalex.org/W1535604760,"Recent findings in purified systems demonstrate the universality of DNA polymerase-primase complexes which may function in the priming and continuation of eucaryotic DNA replication. In this report we characterize an in vitro, nuclear matrix-associated, priming and continuation system that can utilize either endogenous matrix-bound DNA or exogenous single-stranded DNA as template. 30-40% of total nuclear DNA primase activity was recovered in association with the isolated nuclear matrix fraction from regenerating rat liver. Matrix-bound primase catalyzed the alpha-amanitin, actinomycin D-resistant synthesis of oligonucleotide chains of 8-50 nucleotides on the endogenous template. At least a portion of the RNA primers were continued by DNA polymerase alpha with deoxynucleoside triphosphate incorporation up to 300-600 nucleotides. Nearest neighbor analysis revealed ribodeoxynucleotide covalent linkages in these RNA-DNA chains. The matrix-bound primase preferred single-stranded fd DNA as exogenous template over synthetic homopolymers and was strictly dependent on the presence of ribonucleoside triphosphates. Appropriate subfractionation revealed that the matrix-bound primase activity is exclusively localized in the nuclear matrix interior. The ability of primase and DNA polymerase to synthesize covalently linked RNA-DNA products demonstrates the potentially useful role of the nuclear matrix in vitro system for elucidating the organizational and functional properties of the eucaryotic replication apparatus in the cell nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W1510480157,"Five aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases found in the high molecular weight core complex were phosphorylated in rabbit reticulocytes following labeling with 32P. The synthetases were isolated by affinity chromatography on tRNA-Sepharose followed by immunoprecipitation. The five synthetases phosphorylated were the glutamyl-, glutaminyl-, lysyl-, and aspartyl-tRNA synthetases and, to a lesser extent, the methionyl-tRNA synthetase. In addition, a 37,000-dalton protein, associated with the synthetase complex and tentatively identified as casein kinase I, was also phosphorylated in intact cells. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the proteins indicated all of the phosphate was on seryl residues. Incubation of reticulocytes with 32P in the presence of 8-bromo-cAMP and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine resulted in a 6-fold increase in phosphorylation of the glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase and a 2-fold increase in phosphorylation of the aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. When the high molecular weight core complex was isolated by gel filtration/affinity chromatography, the profile of phosphorylation was similar to that observed by immunoprecipitation with a 9- and 3-fold stimulation of the glutaminyl- and aspartyl tRNA-synthetase, respectively. From this data it was concluded that the increased phosphorylation of the glutaminyl- and aspartyl-tRNA synthetases obtained with 8-bromo-cAMP did not appear to be involved in dissociation of the high molecular weight core complex."
https://openalex.org/W1602294968,"Recent work directed toward the development of a malarial vaccine has focused on the identification and production of the immunodominant repeating peptide of the circumsporozoite protein of the human malaria parasites as an antigen. An important factor which relates to the usefulness of this antigen in a vaccine is the rate at which the molecule changes in sequence. We have determined the sequence and arrangement of the repeating epitope of the circumsporozoite protein gene from a Plasmodium vivax isolate from La Paz, El Salvador (Sal-I). This is compared with a portion of the previously published sequence of the circumsporozoite protein gene from a P. vivax isolate from Belem, Brazil. The genes appear to be very similar in the repeat region. There are 20 similar repeating units in the El Salvador strain and only 19 units are conserved in the Brazilian strain. Following this there are degenerate repeats in both strains. Even the pattern of silent mutations in the repeat area are similar; however, they are not necessarily in the identical location and appear to have shifted. The data suggest that the repeat region of these genes may be evolving by an accelerated mechanism(s). Such a phenomenon could severely decrease the long-term efficacy of a repeat-based anti-sporozoite vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W1499325684,"The inhibition of Fe(II)-bleomycin activation, by a large excess of DNA, is overcome by rat liver microsomes in the presence of NADPH. This release of inhibition, as indicated by increased yields of base propenal from DNA scission, is enhanced by menadione, is inhibited by superoxide dismutase, and is therefore dependent on superoxide anion. Microsomal activation of Fe(II)-bleomycin doubles the stoichiometry of base propenal yield compared to that obtained upon self-activation of the drug; 0.5 mol of base propenal is formed and 0.5 mol of NADPH is oxidized per mol of Fe(II)-bleomycin. In the presence of a large excess of DNA, Cu(II)-bleomycin is not reduced and Fe(III)-bleomycin is neither reduced nor activated by microsomes in cases where activation of Fe(II)-bleomycin is maximal. We suggest that in vivo, electron transport enzymes at or near the nucleus can stimulate the activation of Fe(II)-bleomycin under conditions where self-activation does not readily occur."
https://openalex.org/W1982872282,"Genetic analysis provides an approach for identifying regulatory loci that govern the expression of specific genes within the context of the entire organism. Such analyses have defined two unlinked regulatory loci, termed raf and Rif, that modulate the levels of alpha-fetoprotein in liver. Of primary importance for the isolation and characterization of the raf product is to determine whether it is produced by the hepatocyte or whether it is produced by a different cell type. By means of analysis of alpha-fetoprotein expression in livers of embryo aggregation chimeras derived from mice of different raf genotypes it was possible to conclude that the product of the raf locus is expressed as a hepatocyte autonomous function that acts in trans to regulate the level of alpha-fetoprotein messenger RNA."
https://openalex.org/W2127226858,"A cyclic AMP and calcium-independent protein kinase has been identified and purified from pig brain to near homogeneity. This independent protein kinase was isolated in an inactive form, and activation required ATP and Mg2+. On sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the purified enzyme contains 1 subunit with a molecular mass of about 36 kDa. Although there was no significant phosphorylation of phosphorylase, phosphorylase b kinase, casein, phosvitin, and protamine, this kinase was found to be very active toward myelin basic protein and histones H1, 2A, and 2B. Trypsinolysis completely destroyed the kinase activity, indicating that this is not a protease-activated protein kinase. More interesting, this cAMP and calcium-independent protein kinase can be regulated by its state of phosphorylation. In its non-phosphorylated state, the kinase was essentially inactive but could be fully activated when the enzyme was phosphorylated up to a 1:1 molar ratio. Conversely, partial dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated enzyme was associated with a time-dependent decrease in the kinase activity and a loss of 32P. All the results taken together point out that this kinase is distinguished from all the reported protein kinases and may represent a previously undiscovered protein kinase. The results also provide initial evidence that a cascade activation mechanism may possibly be involved in the regulation of a protein kinase activity which is independent of cAMP and calcium."
https://openalex.org/W1513105997,"Functional compatibility between the F1 and F0 parts of ATP synthases from Escherichia coli (EF1F0) and the thermophilic bacterium PS3 (TF1F0) was analyzed. F1-stripped everted membrane vesicles from both organisms bound the homologous or heterologous F1 part to the same extent. Titration of the reconstituted membrane vesicles with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide revealed a similar sensitivity of the homologous and hybrid F1F0 complexes towards the inhibitor. Furthermore, the heterologous enzymes exhibited ATP-dependent H+ translocation comparable to that of homologous F1F0. Antisera raised against EF1 or subunits a, b, and c of EF0 were analyzed for cross-reactivity with TF1 and TF0. Common antigenic sites have been detected with immunoblot analysis for subunit beta and subunit c of EF1F0 and the corresponding subunits from TF1F0. A weak binding of the anti-a and anti-b antisera with the TF0 part has been observed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Based on these findings the structural and functional relationship between the mesophilic and thermophilic ATP synthase complexes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1898122322,"A monoclonal antibody directed against the beta-subunit of dog kidney Na+,K+-ATPase was generated. Immunoblots demonstrate that monoclonal antibody III 18A binds exclusively to the denaturated beta-subunit. Binding experiments with membranes and whole cells reveal that III 18A binds to membranes but not to whole cells, indicating that the antibody binds to a cytoplasmic domain on the native beta-subunit. To localize the antibody-binding epitope, purified membrane-bound enzyme was fragmented by protease treatment. Tryptic digestion yields a 30-kDa fragment of the beta-subunit, which still retains the binding capacity for the antibody. Thus III 18A probably does not bind to the NH2-terminal segment of the protein. On the other hand, fragmentation of the beta-subunit with low concentrations of papain, which is known to yield a 40-kDa NH2-terminal and a 16-kDa COOH-terminal fragment, results in a complete loss of III 18A binding. These results suggest that the antibody-binding epitope is localized at or near a papain cleavage site on the COOH-terminal part of the beta-subunit. This is inconsistent with a structure model of the beta-subunit containing only a single transmembrane hydrophobic segment with a cytoplasmic NH2-terminal portion, but agrees quite well with a hypothetical structure with four intramembrane segments."
