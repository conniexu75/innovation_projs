https://openalex.org/W2056811697,"Cationic substances, including some drugs, can activate mast cells in an IgE-independent manner, leading to histamine release, inflammation and airway contraction; here, the G-protein-coupled receptor MrgprB2, the orthologue of human MRGPRX2, is shown to be the sole mast cell receptor for these substances in mice. Mast cells, innate immune cells found in most tissues of the body and are active in allergic reactions. Mast cells can be activated in an immunoglobulin-E-independent manner by cationic substances such as pro-inflammatory signalling peptides, therapeutic drugs and components of animal toxins, leading to histamine release, inflammation and airway contraction. Xinzhong Dong and colleagues now show that a single G-protein-coupled receptor called Mrgprb2, the orthologue of human MRGPRX2, is the sole mast cell receptor for these substances in mice. This work identifies MRGPRX2 as a potential therapeutic target to counter a range of drug-induced adverse effects, and Mrgprb2 knockouts and other mice used in the study will provide a model in which to address the role of antibody-independent activation of mast cells in diseases with an allergic component. Mast cells are primary effectors in allergic reactions, and may have important roles in disease by secreting histamine and various inflammatory and immunomodulatory substances1,2. Although they are classically activated by immunoglobulin (Ig)E antibodies, a unique property of mast cells is their antibody-independent responsiveness to a range of cationic substances, collectively called basic secretagogues, including inflammatory peptides and drugs associated with allergic-type reactions1,3. The pathogenic roles of these substances have prompted a decades-long search for their receptor(s). Here we report that basic secretagogues activate mouse mast cells in vitro and in vivo through a single receptor, Mrgprb2, the orthologue of the human G-protein-coupled receptor MRGPRX2. Secretagogue-induced histamine release, inflammation and airway contraction are abolished in Mrgprb2-null mutant mice. Furthermore, we show that most classes of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved peptidergic drugs associated with allergic-type injection-site reactions also activate Mrgprb2 and MRGPRX2, and that injection-site inflammation is absent in mutant mice. Finally, we determine that Mrgprb2 and MRGPRX2 are targets of many small-molecule drugs associated with systemic pseudo-allergic, or anaphylactoid, reactions; we show that drug-induced symptoms of anaphylactoid responses are significantly reduced in knockout mice; and we identify a common chemical motif in several of these molecules that may help predict side effects of other compounds. These discoveries introduce a mouse model to study mast cell activation by basic secretagogues and identify MRGPRX2 as a potential therapeutic target to reduce a subset of drug-induced adverse effects."

A recent segmented dyke intrusion (a sheet of magma tracing its way through and across the surrounding rocks) is reshaping the landscape in the Bárðarbunga volcanic system in Iceland. Freysteinn Sigmundsson and co-authors have used seismicity and ground deformation mapped by global positioning system (GPS) and satellite radar images to show that the dyke grew laterally for 45 km during a 14-day period in August 2014. Dyke opening and seismicity were focused at the most distal segment, where lateral dyke growth with segment barrier breaking by pressure build-up occurred. Dyke growth was slowed by an effusive fissure eruption near the end of the dyke. Crust at many divergent plate boundaries forms primarily by the injection of vertical sheet-like dykes, some tens of kilometres long1. Previous models of rifting events indicate either lateral dyke growth away from a feeding source, with propagation rates decreasing as the dyke lengthens2,3,4, or magma flowing vertically into dykes from an underlying source5,6, with the role of topography on the evolution of lateral dykes not clear. Here we show how a recent segmented dyke intrusion in the Bárðarbunga volcanic system grew laterally for more than 45 kilometres at a variable rate, with topography influencing the direction of propagation. Barriers at the ends of each segment were overcome by the build-up of pressure in the dyke end; then a new segment formed and dyke lengthening temporarily peaked. The dyke evolution, which occurred primarily over 14 days, was revealed by propagating seismicity, ground deformation mapped by Global Positioning System (GPS), interferometric analysis of satellite radar images (InSAR), and graben formation. The strike of the dyke segments varies from an initially radial direction away from the Bárðarbunga caldera, towards alignment with that expected from regional stress at the distal end. A model minimizing the combined strain and gravitational potential energy explains the propagation path. Dyke opening and seismicity focused at the most distal segment at any given time, and were simultaneous with magma source deflation and slow collapse at the Bárðarbunga caldera, accompanied by a series of magnitude M > 5 earthquakes. Dyke growth was slowed down by an effusive fissure eruption near the end of the dyke. Lateral dyke growth with segment barrier breaking by pressure build-up in the dyke distal end explains how focused upwelling of magma under central volcanoes is effectively redistributed over long distances to create new upper crust at divergent plate boundaries."
https://openalex.org/W2029492292,"Gene transcription in animals involves the assembly of RNA polymerase II at core promoters and its cell-type-specific activation by enhancers that can be located more distally. However, how ubiquitous expression of housekeeping genes is achieved has been less clear. In particular, it is unknown whether ubiquitously active enhancers exist and how developmental and housekeeping gene regulation is separated. An attractive hypothesis is that different core promoters might exhibit an intrinsic specificity to certain enhancers. This is conceivable, as various core promoter sequence elements are differentially distributed between genes of different functions, including elements that are predominantly found at either developmentally regulated or at housekeeping genes. Here we show that thousands of enhancers in Drosophila melanogaster S2 and ovarian somatic cells (OSCs) exhibit a marked specificity to one of two core promoters--one derived from a ubiquitously expressed ribosomal protein gene and another from a developmentally regulated transcription factor--and confirm the existence of these two classes for five additional core promoters from genes with diverse functions. Housekeeping enhancers are active across the two cell types, while developmental enhancers exhibit strong cell-type specificity. Both enhancer classes differ in their genomic distribution, the functions of neighbouring genes, and the core promoter elements of these neighbouring genes. In addition, we identify two transcription factors--Dref and Trl--that bind and activate housekeeping versus developmental enhancers, respectively. Our results provide evidence for a sequence-encoded enhancer-core-promoter specificity that separates developmental and housekeeping gene regulatory programs for thousands of enhancers and their target genes across the entire genome."
https://openalex.org/W1972772651,"The ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are high-conductance intracellular Ca2+ channels that play a pivotal role in the excitation–contraction coupling of skeletal and cardiac muscles. RyRs are the largest known ion channels, with a homotetrameric organization and approximately 5,000 residues in each protomer. Here we report the structure of the rabbit RyR1 in complex with its modulator FKBP12 at an overall resolution of 3.8 Å, determined by single-particle electron cryomicroscopy. Three previously uncharacterized domains, named central, handle and helical domains, display the armadillo repeat fold. These domains, together with the amino-terminal domain, constitute a network of superhelical scaffold for binding and propagation of conformational changes. The channel domain exhibits the voltage-gated ion channel superfamily fold with distinct features. A negative-charge-enriched hairpin loop connecting S5 and the pore helix is positioned above the entrance to the selectivity-filter vestibule. The four elongated S6 segments form a right-handed helical bundle that closes the pore at the cytoplasmic border of the membrane. Allosteric regulation of the pore by the cytoplasmic domains is mediated through extensive interactions between the central domains and the channel domain. These structural features explain high ion conductance by RyRs and the long-range allosteric regulation of channel activities. Using electron cryomicroscopy, the structure of the closed-state rabbit ryanodine receptor RyR1 in complex with its modulator FKBP12 is solved at 3.8 Å; in addition to determining structural details of the ion-conducting channel domain, three previously uncharacterized domains help to reveal a molecular scaffold that allows long-range allosteric regulation of channel activities. Muscle contraction is regulated by the concentration of calcium ions in the cytoplasm of muscle cells. Ryanodine receptors (RyR) release Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum to induce muscle contraction. Dysfunction of these channels contributes to the pathophysiology of important human diseases including muscular dystrophy. Three papers in this issue of Nature report high-resolution electron cryomicroscopy structures of the 2.2 MDa ryanodine receptor RyR1. Efremov et al. report the structure of rabbit RyR1 at 8.5 Å resolution the presence of Ca2+ in a 'partly open' state, and at 6.1 Å resolution in the absence of Ca2+ in a closed state. Zalk et al. report the rabbit RyR1 structure at 4.8 Å in the absence of Ca2+ in a closed state. And third, Yan et al. report the structure of rabbit RyR1 bound to its modulator FKBP12 at a near-atomic resolution of 3.8 Å. These papers reveal how calcium binding to the EF-hand domain of RyR1 regulates channel opening and facilitates calcium-induced calcium release. The authors also note that disease-causing mutations are clustered in regions of the channel that appear to be critical for normal channel function."
https://openalex.org/W1977251152,"Reports of plumes or patches of methane in the martian atmosphere that vary over monthly time scales have defied explanation to date. From in situ measurements made over a 20-month period by the tunable laser spectrometer of the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite on Curiosity at Gale crater, we report detection of background levels of atmospheric methane of mean value 0.69 ± 0.25 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) at the 95% confidence interval (CI). This abundance is lower than model estimates of ultraviolet degradation of accreted interplanetary dust particles or carbonaceous chondrite material. Additionally, in four sequential measurements spanning a 60-sol period (where 1 sol is a martian day), we observed elevated levels of methane of 7.2 ± 2.1 ppbv (95% CI), implying that Mars is episodically producing methane from an additional unknown source."
https://openalex.org/W2063116040,"During endocytosis, energy is invested to narrow the necks of cargo-containing plasma membrane invaginations to radii at which the opposing segments spontaneously coalesce, thereby leading to the detachment by scission of endocytic uptake carriers. In the clathrin pathway, dynamin uses mechanical energy from GTP hydrolysis to this effect, assisted by the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain-containing protein endophilin. Clathrin-independent endocytic events are often less reliant on dynamin, and whether in these cases BAR domain proteins such as endophilin contribute to scission has remained unexplored. Here we show, in human and other mammalian cell lines, that endophilin-A2 (endoA2) specifically and functionally associates with very early uptake structures that are induced by the bacterial Shiga and cholera toxins, which are both clathrin-independent endocytic cargoes. In controlled in vitro systems, endoA2 reshapes membranes before scission. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endoA2, dynamin and actin contribute in parallel to the scission of Shiga-toxin-induced tubules. Our results establish a novel function of endoA2 in clathrin-independent endocytosis. They document that distinct scission factors operate in an additive manner, and predict that specificity within a given uptake process arises from defined combinations of universal modules. Our findings highlight a previously unnoticed link between membrane scaffolding by endoA2 and pulling-force-driven dynamic scission."
https://openalex.org/W2144875446,"In Caenorhabditis elegans, reduced insulin/IGF-1 signalling can promote longevity through a program that is genetically distinct from the dauer developmental pathway, and requires SKN-1-dependent collagen remodelling that is a broadly essential feature of longevity assurance pathways. In the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans, reduced insulin/IGF-I signalling can promote longevity by inducing the dauer larva stage, a state of suspended animation enabling survival in harsh conditions. Collin Ewald et al. now describe a mechanism by which reduced insulin/IGF-1 signalling promotes longevity through a program genetically distinct from the dauer developmental pathway. This process, which requires the longevity factor SKN-1/Nrf for lifespan extension when insulin/IGF-I signalling is low, induces the expression of collagens and other extracellular matrix genes. Importantly, overexpression of collagens alone can extend the lifespan of C. elegans. Interventions that delay ageing mobilize mechanisms that protect and repair cellular components1,2,3, but it is unknown how these interventions might slow the functional decline of extracellular matrices4,5, which are also damaged during ageing6,7. Reduced insulin/IGF-1 signalling (rIIS) extends lifespan across the evolutionary spectrum, and in juvenile Caenorhabditis elegans also allows the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO to induce development into dauer, a diapause that withstands harsh conditions1,2. It has been suggested that rIIS delays C. elegans ageing through activation of dauer-related processes during adulthood2,8,9, but some rIIS conditions confer robust lifespan extension unaccompanied by any dauer-like traits1,10,11. Here we show that rIIS can promote C. elegans longevity through a program that is genetically distinct from the dauer pathway, and requires the Nrf (NF-E2-related factor) orthologue SKN-1 acting in parallel to DAF-16. SKN-1 is inhibited by IIS and has been broadly implicated in longevity12,13,14, but is rendered dispensable for rIIS lifespan extension by even mild activity of dauer-related processes. When IIS is decreased under conditions that do not induce dauer traits, SKN-1 most prominently increases expression of collagens and other extracellular matrix genes. Diverse genetic, nutritional, and pharmacological pro-longevity interventions delay an age-related decline in collagen expression. These collagens mediate adulthood extracellular matrix remodelling, and are needed for ageing to be delayed by interventions that do not involve dauer traits. By genetically delineating a dauer-independent rIIS ageing pathway, our results show that IIS controls a broad set of protective mechanisms during C. elegans adulthood, and may facilitate elucidation of processes of general importance for longevity. The importance of collagen production in diverse anti-ageing interventions implies that extracellular matrix remodelling is a generally essential signature of longevity assurance, and that agents promoting extracellular matrix youthfulness may have systemic benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2085641953,"The study of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data has greatly benefitted from the development of sophisticated and efficient algorithms aimed at automating and optimizing the analysis of brain data. We address, in the context of the segmentation of brain from non-brain tissue (i.e., brain extraction, also known as skull-stripping), the tension between the increased theoretical and clinical interest in patient data, and the difficulty of conventional algorithms to function optimally in the presence of gross brain pathology. Indeed, because of the reliance of many algorithms on priors derived from healthy volunteers, images with gross pathology can severely affect their ability to correctly trace the boundaries between brain and non-brain tissue, potentially biasing subsequent analysis. We describe and make available an optimized brain extraction script for the pathological brain (optiBET) robust to the presence of pathology. Rather than attempting to trace the boundary between tissues, optiBET performs brain extraction by (i) calculating an initial approximate brain extraction; (ii) employing linear and non-linear registration to project the approximate extraction into the MNI template space; (iii) back-projecting a standard brain-only mask from template space to the subject's original space; and (iv) employing the back-projected brain-only mask to mask-out non-brain tissue. The script results in up to 94% improvement of the quality of extractions over those obtained with conventional software across a large set of severely pathological brains. Since optiBET makes use of freely available algorithms included in FSL, it should be readily employable by anyone having access to such tools."

Our results identify molecular determinants of cancer progression of potential utility in the prognosis and therapy of breast cancer. Cancer cells within breast carcinomas coexist with a heterogeneous milieu of stromal cells that collectively constitute the tumor-associated microenvironment. Numerous studies have provided substantial evidence that the interactions between cancer cells and components of the tumor stroma are pivotal in breast cancer pathogenesis (Barcellos-Hoff et al., 2013Barcellos-Hoff M.H. Lyden D. Wang T.C. The evolution of the cancer niche during multistage carcinogenesis.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2013; 13: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In particular, such interactions—which co-opt mechanisms of wound healing, tissue maintenance, or development—appear to induce changes in cancer cells that are sufficient to actuate metastatic progression (Quail and Joyce, 2013Quail D.F. Joyce J.A. Microenvironmental regulation of tumor progression and metastasis.Nat. Med. 2013; 19: 1423-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (4440) Google Scholar). On this front, our group and others have shown that contextual mechanisms instigated in the cancer cells by the tumor microenvironment can cause dramatic increases in cancer malignancy via ostensibly reversible processes, such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions (EMTs) (e.g., El-Haibi et al., 2012El-Haibi C.P. Bell G.W. Zhang J. Collmann A.Y. Wood D. Scherber C.M. Csizmadia E. Mariani O. Zhu C. Campagne A. et al.Critical role for lysyl oxidase in mesenchymal stem cell-driven breast cancer malignancy.Proc.

Transitions between epithelial and mesenchymal states: acquisition of malignant and stem cell traits.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2009; 9: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar). Indeed, cancer cells appear to be highly responsive to promalignant signals originating from the tumor microenvironment, providing attractive new avenues for the development of therapeutic approaches based on the inhibition of tumor-stroma crosstalk. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs; also known as mesenchymal stromal cells) are a heterogeneous class of stromal progenitor cells that participate in tissue maintenance under normal homeostasis and are likewise closely associated with pathologic stromal responses to tissue injury and neoplasia (Cuiffo and Karnoub, 2012Cuiffo B.G.

In the context of developing breast carcinomas, tumor-proximal MSCs have been shown to serve as active catalysts of cancer progression, robustly promoting breast cancer cell (BCC) invasion and metastasis (Karnoub et al., 2007Karnoub A.E.

Sun R. Origuchi M. Kanehira M. Takahata T. Itoh J. Umezawa A. Kijima H. Fukuda S. Saijo Y. Mesenchymal stromal cells promote tumor growth through the enhancement of neovascularization.Mol.

Indeed, MSCs recovered from human breast, prostate, or ovarian tumors display promalignant phenotypes indicative of their crucial supportive functions in the progression of these tumors (McLean et al., 2011McLean K.

However, at present, the molecular mechanisms underlying MSC contributions to tumor pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, or miRs) are short noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression via hybridization to complementary sequences of mRNAs, resulting in either translational inhibition or degradation of the target sequences (Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15858) Google Scholar). miRNAs may affect the expression of hundreds of targets, thereby serving to define cellular identity and differentiation state through large-scale regulation of gene expression programs (Miyoshi et al., 2011Miyoshi N. Ishii H. Nagano H. Haraguchi N. Dewi D.L. Kano Y. Nishikawa S. Tanemura M. Mimori K. Tanaka F. et al.Reprogramming of mouse and human cells to pluripotency using mature microRNAs.Cell Stem Cell. 2011; 8: 633-638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Importantly, miRNAs play critical functions in cancer pathogenesis and an expanding body of evidence has cataloged their deregulation in multiple aspects of tumor development, including invasion and metastasis (Ma et al., 2007Ma L. Teruya-Feldstein J. Weinberg R.A. Tumour invasion and metastasis initiated by microRNA-10b in breast cancer.Nature. 2007; 449: 682-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (2221) Google Scholar, Tavazoie et al., 2008Tavazoie S.F. Alarcón C.

Endogenous human microRNAs that suppress breast cancer metastasis.Nature. 2008; 451: 147-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1625) Google Scholar). To date, however, promalignant alterations to the cancer cell miRNA landscape as derived from their interactions with stromal cells have not been comprehensively characterized. In the present work, we sought to identify potential miRNA deregulations associated with breast cancer malignancy instigated by prometastatic MSCs. We found that MSCs trigger a select set of miRNAs in BCCs, which, spearheaded by miR-199a, converge on and repress the expression of the transcription factor forkhead-box P2 (FOXP2). FOXP2 is a transcriptional repressor that has been primarily implicated in regulating speech and language development, as well as developmental neurogenesis, in humans (Fisher and Scharff, 2009Fisher S.E. Scharff C. FOXP2 as a molecular window into speech and language.Trends Genet. 2009; 25: 166-177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, Tsui et al., 2013Tsui D.

Aside from serving functions in the differentiation of tissues such as lung and esophagus (Shu et al., 2007Shu W. Lu M.M. Zhang Y. Tucker P.W. Zhou D. Morrisey E.E. Foxp2 and Foxp1 cooperatively regulate lung and esophagus development.Development. 2007; 134: 1991-2000Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), little is known regarding the roles of FOXP2 in nonneuronal contexts. We report here that miR-199a overexpression, or FOXP2 silencing, endows BCCs with cancer-stem-cell (CSC)-like traits, enhances their tumor-initiating capabilities, and fosters their metastatic propensities. We describe miR-199a upregulation and FOXP2 repression as prominent features of aggressive clinical breast cancers, and we found that they represent independent prognostic parameters for overall patient survival, indicative of their critical roles in breast tumor pathogenesis. Our work implicates a causal role for the speech gene FOXP2 in breast cancer metastasis and elucidates elements of its tumor-stroma-initiated miRNA regulatory network. To characterize the miRNA alterations exhibited by MSC-primed BCCs, we cultured GFP-labeled MDA-MB-231 BCCs together with human bone-marrow-derived MSCs (BCC:MSC ratio of 1:3) for 3 days. GFP-BCCs were then isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; MDA-MB-231MSC), and their mature miRNAs were profiled by subtractive miRNA arrays (Agilent) using RNA derived from resting GFP-BCCs cultured alone as control (Figure 1A). These analyses revealed that only six miRNAs were significantly enriched (≥2-fold; adjusted p < 0.05) in MDA-MB-231MSC when compared to control BCCs (Figure 1A): miR-199a-3p, miR-34a, miR-762, miR-214, miR-let-7b, and miR-1915. Semiquantitative real-time PCR (rtPCR-ΔΔct) was used to validate the microarray findings, and it confirmed a multifold induction of these miRNAs in MSC-activated BCCs (Figure 1B). Among this set, miR-199a-3p particularly attracted our attention. Noticeably, miR-199a-3p levels exhibited the highest levels of enrichment in MDA-MB-231MSC compared to the other MSC-triggered miRs, rising more than ∼65-fold over those of controls (Figure 1B). Interestingly, miR-199a-3p upregulation, while not previously functionally correlated with human breast carcinoma development, has been observed in other cancer contexts, such as esophageal (Feber et al., 2011Feber A.

We observed that the MDA-MB-231MSC population continued to produce high levels of miR-199a-3p even after separation from MSCs (Figure S1A available online), suggesting that its induction was sustained and intrinsic to BCCMSC. In this regard, miR-199a-3p derives from two separate genomic regions in humans: one located on chromosome 19 and the other on chromosome 1, comprising the miR-199a1 (A1) and miR-199a2 (A2) loci, respectively. We proceeded to determine the relative contributions of A1 or A2 to the levels of mature miR-199a-3p present in MDA-MB-231MSC by assessing the levels of the distinct locus-specific miRNA precursor stem-loops (pri-miRs) using rtPCR-ΔΔct. These experiments revealed that both pri-miR-199a1 and pri-miR-199a2 were significantly increased in MDA-MB-231MSC, with a slightly elevated contribution of A1 (∼60%) compared to A2 (∼40%) (Figure 1C). Interestingly, miR-199a2 is transcribed from an intronic sequence of the DNM3OS gene, which also encodes for miR-214. miR-214 was similarly identified in our profiling arrays as induced by ∼15-fold in MDA-MB-231MSC (Figure 1B) and likewise maintained elevated levels 3 days after separation from MSCs (Figure S1A). These observations suggest that miR-199a-3p (produced from the A1 and A2 loci) and miR-214 (produced form the A2 locus) are functionally coregulated in MDA-MB-231MSC. To probe whether the ability of MSCs to trigger miR-199a-3p and miR-214 upregulation in BCCs is idiosyncratic to the MDA-MB-231 model, we tested the response of other BCCs to MSCs. Indeed, admixture of MSCs to MCF7/Ras, T47D, and MDA-MB-435 cells caused significant upregulation of both miR-199a-3p and miR-214, albeit to different extents with differing ratios of miR-199a-3p/miR-214 (Figure 1D), likely a consequence of the relative contributions of A1 versus A2 loci in these systems. Of note is that robust induction of miR-199a-3p and miR-214 by bone-marrow-derived MSCs required cell-cell contact between BCCs and MSCs (Figure S1B) and did not occur upon the contact of BCCs with phenotypically similar fibroblastic cells, such as WI-38 cells or panniculus-derived MSCs (ad-MSCs; Figure S1C). Interestingly, the contact of BCCs with human-breast-derived MSCs (Br-MSCs; derived from reduction mammoplasty) or activated fibroblasts (CAFs; derived from human breast tumors) resulted in only miR-199a-3p upregulation, and not that of miR-214 (Figure S1C). Together, these observations suggest that bone-marrow-derived MSCs may be uniquely capable of activating both A1 and A2 loci, while highlighting miR-199a-3p activation as a potential common element of the BCC response to activated stroma in multiple settings. Because our miRNA profiling studies were conducted on whole BCCMSC populations, we could not rule out the possibility that certain BCCs within the total population express both miR-199a-3p and miR-214 (i.e., where both loci, or the A2 locus alone, is active), while others express only miR-199a-3p (i.e., when A1 locus alone is active). Accordingly, we proceeded to model both possibilities, stably expressing exogenous miR-199a, or both miR-199a and miR-214, in MDA-MB-231 cells (BCC199a and BCC199a/214, respectively). The expression levels of the respective miRNAs in BCC199a and BCC199a/214, verified by rtPCR-ΔΔct and compared to control counterparts harboring an empty vector (BCCnull), showed >40-fold and >3-fold upregulation in miR-199a-3p and miR-214 levels, respectively (Figure S2A). We first explored the malignant potential of BCC199a and BCC199a/214 by examining their tumorigenic and metastatic abilities compared to BCCnull. For this purpose, equal numbers of cells of each group were implanted subcutaneously into athymic Nude mice and allowed to form tumors for 10–14 weeks. While BCC199a and BCC199a/214 tumors did not differ from BCCnull tumors in average weight at the time of tissue harvest (∼0.5–0.65 g; Figure 2A), enumeration of the GFP-positive BCC colonies in the lungs of the respective animals using fluorescence microscopy revealed that mice implanted with either BCC199a or BCC199a/214 had ∼3-fold the average of lung metastases per gram of tumor when compared with BCCnull controls (Figures 2B and 2C). These experiments demonstrated an enhanced malignancy of BCC199a and BCC199a/214 in vivo and prompted us to further characterize their metastasis-associated phenotypic attributes in vitro. In these regards, BCC199a and BCC199a/214 exhibited no proliferative advantage over their control counterparts in 2D culture conditions (Figure S2B). Furthermore, these cells did not display increased expression of mesenchymal markers, such as vimentin, N-cadherin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), or lysyl oxidase (LOX) at the mRNA and/or protein levels, and they exhibited some resurgence in E-cadherin mRNA expression (Figures S2C and S2D). In addition, BCC199a and BCC199a/214 manifested an ∼50% reduced intrinsic motility compared to BCCnull in Boyden chamber motility assays (Figure S2E). These observations suggested that the increased metastasis observed in BCC199a and BCC199a/214 is manifested through pathways distinct from those governing proliferation, invasion, and motility. Our group and others have previously demonstrated that MSC activation of BCCs increases the population of putative CSCs as demonstrated by multifold upregulation in ALDH1 positivity and mammosphere-forming capacities (El-Haibi et al., 2012El-Haibi C.P. Bell G.W. Zhang J. Collmann A.Y. Wood D. Scherber C.M. Csizmadia E. Mariani O. Zhu C. Campagne A. et al.Critical role for lysyl oxidase in mesenchymal stem cell-driven breast cancer malignancy.Proc.

Dutcher J. Kleer C.G. et al.Breast cancer stem cells are regulated by mesenchymal stem cells through cytokine networks.Cancer Res. 2011; 71: 614-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). CSCs are characterized by their distinctive capacity for tumor initiation, a trait that is thought to be integral to metastatic colonization because disseminated cancer cells engender new growths at distant sites (Malanchi et al., 2012Malanchi I. Santamaria-Martínez A. Susanto E. Peng H. Lehr H.A. Delaloye J.F. Huelsken J. Interactions between cancer stem cells and their niche govern metastatic colonization.Nature. 2012; 481: 85-89Crossref Scopus (984) Google Scholar). Supporting this notion, we observed that highly metastatic BCCMSC exhibited increased tumorigenic properties in limiting dilution tumor-initiation analyses, forming subcutaneous tumors in Nude mice ∼2.5 times more frequently than in controls, with as little as 100 cells per injection (Figure S2F). With this information, we proceeded to determine whether the increased metastasis of BCC199a and BCC199a/214 correlated with their acquisition of CSC characteristics. Interestingly, BCC199a and BCC199a/214 displayed enhanced resistance to suspension-induced cell death in a minimal serum tumbling assay, exhibiting >50% survival rates after 24 hr of suspension, and a corresponding >50% reduction in their apoptosis rates as measured by 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD; Figure 2D). In addition, BCC199a and BCC199a/214 displayed increased abilities to grow in low-attachment mammosphere growth conditions after serial passages (Figure 2E), and they showed multifold increases in the expression levels of the CSC-associated marker ALDH1 (Ginestier et al., 2007Ginestier C. Hur M.H. Charafe-Jauffret E. Monville F. Dutcher J. Brown M. Jacquemier J. Viens P. Kleer C.G. Liu S. et al.ALDH1 is a marker of normal and malignant human mammary stem cells and a predictor of poor clinical outcome.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 555-567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar), as determined by rtPCR (Figure S2G) and by ALDEFLUOR-based FACS assays (Figures 2F). Most importantly, however, BCC199a and BCC199a/214 possessed markedly enhanced tumor-initiating capabilities in limiting-dilution tumor assays in Nude mice, forming tumors at 100 cells per injection at ∼2–3 times the rate of their BCCnull controls (Figure 2G). These observations suggested that the enhanced metastasis of BCC199a and BCC199a/214 correlated with their acquisition of CSC-like traits. We found that the enhanced metastasis-related phenotypes of BCC199a were largely similar or identical to those of BCC199a/214, suggesting that the promalignant activities of BCC199a/214 rested largely on the actions of miR-199a. To distinguish between the effects of mature miR-199a-3p and miR-199a-5p, both of which are produced by stable expression of pre-miR-199a from our vector, we transfected individual RNA duplexes—offset to allow generation of only a specific single mature miRNA—coding for either 199a-3p or 199a-5p into MDA-MB-231 cells. While transient expression of 199a-3p led to a significant ∼2.5-fold increase in ALDH1 positivity, 199a-5p expression did not (Figure S2H), despite substantial expression levels of 199a-5p in these cells (Figure S2I). This suggested that miR-199a-3p is the critical miRNA produced from miR-199a in enhancing the observed population of putative CSCs. In these regards, BCC199a exhibited marked increases in the expression levels of additional breast CSC-associated markers, such as MYC (Figure S2J), GD2S, and POSTN (Figure S2K; (Liu et al., 2009Liu M.

Furthermore, stable overexpression of miR-199a in other BCC lines, such as MCF7/Ras, T47D, or MDA-MB-435 cells, led to ∼10-, ∼6-, and ∼4-fold increases, respectively, in their ALDH1 positivity (Figure S2L). Similarly, such expression caused upregulation of POSTN (Figure S2M) and the CD44high/CD24low population (Figure S2N) in T47D cells and increased MYC expression in MCF7/Ras cells (Figure S2J), suggesting that the ability of miR-199a-3p to regulate CSC phenotypes is not idiosyncratic of MDA-MB-231 cells. Notably, >65% of mice tail-vein-injected with BCC199a exhibited lung metastases at limiting conditions where BCCnull controls exhibited none (Figure S2O), suggesting that the induction of CSC traits by miR-199a contributes to secondary tissue colonization. We next aimed to elucidate the mechanistic details underlying the malignancy of BCC199a and BCC199a/214. For this purpose, we probed BCC199a and BCC199a/214 for the expression levels of >20 published targets for miR-199a-3p (or miR-214), but we did not find consistent downregulation of such targets in both BCC199a and BCC199a/214 as compared to BCCnull (Figures S3A and S3B; see Supplemental Information), underscoring the importance of cellular context in determining miRNA functions. To identify potential miRNA effectors in BCC199a and BCC199a/214, we proceeded to utilize array-based approaches, focusing upon those that have been correlated with the acquisition or maintenance of stem-like properties. In these regards, we carried out a targeted rtPCR-ΔΔct array screen of 84 genes associated with stem cell maintenance or differentiation (QIAGEN), evaluating their relative mRNA levels in BCC199a and BCC199a/214 as compared to BCCnull. These analyses indeed identified a number of stem-cell-associated genes that were significantly upregulated in BCC199a and/or BCC199a/214, including GATA-binding protein-6/GATA6 (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang Y.

We used publicly available metagenomic datasets from the Human Microbiome Project and the MetaHIT consortium, and determined the abundance of bile salt hydrolase gene (bsh), 7 alpha-dehydroxylase gene (adh) and 7-alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene (hsdh) in fecal bacteria in diseased populations of Crohn's disease (CD), Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Phylum level abundance analysis showed a significant reduction in Firmicute-derived bsh in UC and T2DM patients but not in CD patients, relative to healthy controls. Reduction of adh and hsdh genes was also seen in UC and T2DM patients, while an increase was observed in the CD population as compared to healthy controls. A further analysis of the bsh genes showed significant differences in the correlations of certain Firmicutes families with disease or healthy populations. From this observation we proceeded to analyse BSH protein sequences and identified BSH proteins clusters representing the most abundant strains in our analysis of Firmicute bsh genes. The abundance of the bsh genes corresponding to one of these protein clusters was significantly reduced in all disease states relative to healthy controls. This cluster includes bsh genes derived from Lachospiraceae, Clostridiaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and Ruminococcaceae families. This metagenomic analysis provides evidence of the importance of bile acid modifying enzymes in health and disease. It further highlights the importance of identifying gene and protein clusters, as the same gene may be associated with health or disease, depending on the strains expressing the enzyme, and differences in the enzymes themselves."
https://openalex.org/W2011654556,"Of water and methane on Mars The Curiosity rover has been collecting data for the past 2 years, since its delivery to Mars (see the Perspective by Zahnle). Many studies now suggest that many millions of years ago, Mars was warmer and wetter than it is today. But those conditions required an atmosphere that seems to have vanished. Using the Curiosity rover, Mahaffy et al. measured the ratio of deuterium to hydrogen in clays that were formed 3.0 to 3.7 billion years ago. Hydrogen escapes more readily than deuterium, so this ratio offers a snapshot measure of the ancient atmosphere that can help constrain when and how it disappeared. Most methane on Earth has a biological origin, so planetary scientists have keenly pursued its detection in the martian atmosphere as well. Now, Webster et al. have precisely confirmed the presence of methane in the martian atmosphere with the instruments aboard the Curiosity rover at Gale crater.

Using the luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) as a model GPCR, we have employed intermolecular cooperation to demonstrate the physiological relevance of class A GPCR homo-di/oligomerization. Transgenic expression of either ligand binding-deficient (LHRB−) or signaling-deficient (LHRS−) receptors was nonfunctional and had no effect on the hypogonadal phenotype of male LHR knock-out mice. However, co-expression of these two mutant receptors could rescue LHR-dependent signaling and infertility of these knock-out animals (10.Rivero-Müller A. Chou Y.Y. Ji I. Lajic S. Hanyaloglu A.C.

To dissect how GPCR di/oligomerization impacts receptor function and to investigate the role of individual receptor protomers within an oligomer, we have determined the spatial and structural organization of GPCR dimers and oligomers employing LHRB− and LHRS− as tools to create functionally asymmetric complexes. By using dual-color photoactivation localization microscopy with photoactivatable dyes (PD-PALM), we achieve a resolution of ∼8 nm to directly visualize individual GPCR molecules participating in dimers and oligomers at the plasma membrane. PD-PALM demonstrates that LHR is organized in preformed dimeric but primarily diverse oligomeric structures with distinct spatial geometries. Furthermore, altering the functional asymmetry of receptors within an oligomer regulates signal sensitivity and strength. Structural modeling highly aligned with the spatial organizations imaged via PD-PALM and further revealed distinct and complex helix interfaces involved in oligomer formation. The combination of super-resolution imaging with structural modeling provides an unprecedented molecular insight into the complexity and spatial and structural assemblies mediating GPCR oligomerization. Recombinant hCG and LH were purchased from National Peptides and Hormones Program (c/o A. F. Parlow, Harbor-UCLA Medical Center).

Miyawaki (RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Japan). cAMP-response element-luciferase (cre-luc) was used for cAMP reporter gene assays, and pRL-CMV transfection control plasmid was purchased from Promega. HEK 293 cells were maintained and cultured as described previously (20.Jonas K.C. Rivero-Müller A. Huhtaniemi I.T. Hanyaloglu A.C. G protein-coupled receptor transactivation: from molecules to mice.Methods Cell Biol. 2013; 117: 433-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). All functional studies were conducted using cell lines stably expressing either HA-WT LHR, HA-LHRB−, FLAG-LHRS−, or co-expressing HA-LHRB− and FLAG-LHRS−. These stable cell lines were generated through Lipofectamine 2000® (Invitrogen)-mediated transfection of the relevant plasmid DNAs, G418 selection, and assessment of cell surface receptor expression by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). All transient transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000® as per the manufacturer's instructions and assayed 48 h post-transfection. BRET-Constitutive and ligand-induced receptor-G protein interactions were assessed by BRET1, as described previously (12.Urizar E. Yano H. Kolster R. Galés C. Lambert N. Javitch J.A. CODA-RET reveals functional selectivity as a result of GPCR heteromerization.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2011; 7: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed and harvested in PBS and seeded at a density of ∼200,000 cells/well into 96-well plates. To measure constitutive G protein receptor association, coelentrazine h (5 μm) was added, and BRET luminescence and fluorescence ratios were recorded at 475/535 nm for a total of 10 cycles using a FLUOstar (BMG). In parallel cells, fluorescence of the mVenus-tagged Gαs or Gαq protein constructs was determined. For ligand-induced BRET changes, coelentrazine h substrate was added, and the BRET ratio at 475 nm/535 nm was recorded for 1 min. Following this, ligand was added, and the BRET ratio was immediately recorded for a further 1 min. BRET signals were calculated by the dividing the values at 535 nm over that omitted at 475 nm. For constitutive receptor-G protein associations, net BRET values were obtained by subtracting the basal BRET ratio of receptor-tagged Rluc8 alone from all readings. The ligand-induced net BRET changes were calculated by subtracting basal readings from stimulated conditions and further subtracting any changes observed with PBS control. For constitutive receptor-G protein association, duplicate readings were taken, and at least three independent experiments were carried out. For ligand-induced BRET changes, triplicate readings were taken, and 6–11 independent experiments were conducted. cre-luc assays were conducted as described previously (10.Rivero-Müller A. Chou Y.Y. Ji I. Lajic S. Hanyaloglu A.C. Jonas K. Rahman N. Ji T.H. Huhtaniemi I. Rescue of defective G protein-coupled receptor function in vivo by intermolecular cooperation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

IP1 accumulation was determined using an IP-One HTRF assay kit (CisBio) and measured using a BMG PHERAstar plate reader with HTRF filters. To monitor Ca2+ mobilization, Fluo-4 Direct (Invitrogen) labeling was employed as per the manufacturer's instructions, and time-resolved Ca2+ mobilization was measured using confocal microscopy. Briefly, cells were loaded with calcium dye for 30 min at 37 °C followed by incubation at room temperature for a further 30 min. Cells were imaged using a TCS-SP5 confocal microscope (Leica) with a ×20 dry objective. Cells were imaged for ∼1 min before agonist treatment, 10 min after agonist addition, and capturing every 1.2 s. Time-lapse movies were analyzed with the Leica LASAF software. HA.11 and FLAG primary antibodies were labeled with CAGE 552 and CAGE 500 photoswitchable dyes as per manufacturer's instructions (Abberior). Using a derivation of Beer-Lambert Law (A = ϵ C.D.), the degree of labeling efficiency was determined for FLAG-CAGE 500 to be 1.0 ± 0.2 dye molecules per antibody and for HA.11-CAGE 552 to be 1.3 ± 0.1 dye molecules per antibody, as per manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated onto 8-chamber well 1.5 borosilicate coverglass (Labtek) slides. For assessment of basal cell surface receptor molecules, cells were incubated with caged fluorophore-labeled HA.11-CAGE 552/FLAG-CAGE 500 antibodies for direct labeling of receptors in 10% FCS in PBS, at 37 °C, with antibody for 30 min. Cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 30 min. The addition of 0.2% glutaraldehyde has been previously shown to dramatically reduce lateral diffusion of transmembrane receptors within the cell membrane, minimizing antibody-induced clustering artifacts that other fixatives can produce (21.Annibale P.

Kusumi A. Membrane molecules mobile even after chemical fixation.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 865-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Additionally, this fixative method has been previously shown to yield the same minimal clustering artifacts (∼4%) when compared with a nonclustering control (23.Scarselli M. Annibale P. Radenovic A. Cell type-specific β2-adrenergic receptor clusters identified using photoactivated localization microscopy are not lipid raft related, but depend on actin cytoskeleton integrity.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 16768-16780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Following fixation, cells were washed in PBS and maintained in PBS for imaging. All labeling of receptors was carried out in the dark to ensure minimal photo-switching of labels. Images were acquired using an inverted Axiovert 200 manual inverted wide-field fluorescent microscope (Zeiss, Germany) fitted with a commercial TIRF condenser kit (TILL Photonics GmbH, Germany), with a 1.45 numerical aperture ×100 oil immersion objective. Photo-conversion of CAGE 500 and 552 dyes was achieved with a polychrome light source at 390 nm (Polychrome IV, TILL Photonics GmbH, Uckfield, UK) and was simultaneously imaged and photo-bleached by 491 and 561 nm laser lines, respectively. As the two laser lines have the same optical path through achromatic lenses, chromatic aberrations were negligible. Simultaneous dual channel imaging of CAGE 500 and 552 dyes was achieved using a beam splitter (Optisplit II, Andor) fitted with a T585lp dichroic and ET520-40 and ET632-60 emission filters (all Chroma). The microscope was contained in a plastic draft-proof enclosure maintained at a constant temperature of 25 °C and mounted on a vibration isolation table (Speirs Robertson Corp.). Laser lines were switched on at least 1 h prior to imaging to allow acclimatization and stabilization of the system. These measures served to ensure minimal sample drift throughout the experiments. Each PD-PALM time series was acquired using a cooled electron multiplying charged coupled device camera (EM-CCD; C9100-13, Hamamatsu) and Simple PCI software, with an exposure time of 30 ms. The use of an EM-CCD camera provided a homogeneous image in both imaged channels, also ensuring the integrity of images obtained. Bleed through between the 491- and 561-nm imaged channels was assessed using singly expressing FLAG-LHRS− and HA-LHRB−, labeled with CAGE 500 and CAGE 552, and determined to be 3.5 ± 1.0 and 4.3 ± 1.1, respectively. Bright field images of each series were acquired at 108.5-ms exposure and grid images used for post-acquisition alignment of the simultaneously imaged CAGE 500 and 552 channels using Fiji software. Localization of receptors detected in 491- and 561-nm channels was individually determined using QuickPALM Fiji plugin (24.Henriques R. Lelek M. Fornasiero E.F. Valtorta F. Zimmer C. Mhlanga M.M. QuickPALM: 3D real-time photoactivation nanoscopy image processing in ImageJ.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 339-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Fluorescent intensity images of cropped nonoverlapping areas of 7 × 7 μm within cell borders from corresponding 491- and 561-nm imaged channels were analyzed using the following parameters: a pixel size of 155 nm, a full-width half-maximum value of 3, and signal to noise ratio of 8. Particles were detected if the signal to noise ratio exceeded 8 and full-width half-maximum was 3 pixels or less. Analyzed areas did not span cell membranes to exclude any potential biasing resulting from edge effects. Data tables containing x-y particle localization coordinates were generated, and two-dimensional coordinates were determined. To analyze the number of associated receptor molecules from the x-y particle localization coordinates, a custom Java application was designed (PD-Interpreter). The individual files generated using QuickPALM containing localization coordinates of each identified molecule observed in the 491 and 561 nm fields were plotted as an image. A second order Getis Franklin neighborhood analysis was conducted, using a search radius of 50 nm, to determine the degree of both homomeric associations (i.e. homo-associating WT LHR, LHRB−, or LHRS− protomers) within an individual channel and asymmetric heteromeric associations (i.e. LHRB− associating with LHRS−) across channels. The analysis worked upon the principle of quantitating the number of molecule(s) within a 50-nm radius of a single identified molecule. To identify dimers and oligomers, the program recursively searched at a 50-nm radius from each associating molecule until no further associating molecules were identified within the allotted search radius (Fig. 1, a and c). Once an associating group of molecules was assigned, the composition of the di/oligomer was identified and omitted from further searches, so that molecules were not double counted. Data were represented in the form of co-localization plots using differential colors to distinguish 491 and 561 channels and heat maps, with individual colors depicting different numbers of associating molecules. Because of the irreversible photoactivating nature of the CAGE PDs, minimal re-activation or photoblinking of the PDs was observed. However, to discount any potential overestimation of di/oligomers, events within the same channel within a radius of 10 nm of a “parent” activated fluorophore (accounting for a localization precision of 20 nm) were discounted from the analysis. This typically resulted in discounting approximately <1% of activated molecules. Flow cytometry was carried out to quantitate receptor cell surface expression in stable cell lines and transient transfections for BRET analysis, using antibody labeling methods to detect receptor epitope tags as described previously (25.Hanyaloglu A.C. McCullagh E. von Zastrow M. Essential role of Hrs in a recycling mechanism mediating functional resensitization of cell signaling.EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The fluorescence intensity of 10,000 cells was collected for each sample, and treatments were performed in triplicate using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). 50 PD-PALM-derived images of trimers and tetramers were randomly selected from 30-s hCG-treated data sets for comparison with computationally derived structural models of LHRB−/LHRS− trimers and tetramers. PD-PALM-imaged and structural model-derived spatial arrangements were compared using inter-sphere distances and geometries, and PD-PALM images and structural models containing the same inter-molecule spatial geometries were grouped. The structural model of the mouse LHR was achieved by comparative modeling (using MODELLER software) (26.Sali A. Blundell T.L. Comparative protein modelling by satisfaction of spatial restraints.J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10548) Google Scholar). The structural template consisted of a chimera between the crystal structure of the ECD of the follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (Protein Data Bank code 4AY9) (27.Jiang X. Liu H. Chen X. Chen P.H. Fischer D. Sriraman V. Yu H.N. Arkinstall S. He X. Structure of follicle-stimulating hormone in complex with the entire ectodomain of its receptor.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 12491-12496Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) and the structure of constitutively active opsin (Protein Data Bank code 3CAP), with ECD deleted, functioning as an endodomain (28.Park J.H. Scheerer P. Hofmann K.P. Choe H.W. Ernst O.P. Crystal structure of the ligand-free G-protein-coupled receptor opsin.Nature. 2008; 454: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Specifically, before deleting the opsin-based N terminus (i.e. 323–356 sequence), the last four amino acids of the FSHR ECD (i.e. the “CEDI” sequence), in particular isoleucine, were fitted onto the corresponding portion of the opsin-based model. Following this, the N terminus was deleted from the endodomain, and the last two amino acids (“DI” sequence) were deleted from the fitted ECD to allow inter-domain junction by comparative modeling. Given the absence of high resolution information on the reciprocal arrangement of the two domains, we think this is a meaningful strategy to adopt. The comparative modeling procedure was carried out as described previously (29.Angelova K. Felline A. Lee M. Patel M. Puett D. Fanelli F. Conserved amino acids participate in the structure networks deputed to intramolecular communication in the lutropin receptor.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2011; 68: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The following disulfide bridges were allowed to form while modeling: Cys-109–Cys-134, Cys-257– Cys-321, Cys-258–Cys-331, Cys-282-Cys-314, and Cys-417–Cys-492. External α-helical restraints were assigned to the 253–273 amino acid stretch belonging to the ill-defined portion of the hinge region. The seventh best model (according to restraint violation) out of 100 was finally selected as also holding one of the best main chain stereochemistry. This model was subjected to refinement of the first extracellular and second intracellular loops (EL1 and IL2, respectively). The best model from such refinement was finally subjected to side chain adjustment when in nonallowed conformations. Because of low resolution, the amino acid segment 283–313 of the hinge region was deleted. The resulting model was used to produce surrogates of the LHRB− and LHRS− forms. The former was indeed a truncation of the LHRB− form (i.e. the sequence 1–614) lacking the C-tail, which had no homologous structural template. The LHRS− form consisted of the 1–530 sequence ending at the cytosolic extension of helix 5. Although this may be an oversimplified way to produce the truncated LHRS− form, as it is based on the assumption that it retains the same structure as in the full-length protein, our functional evidence that the LHRS− is able to bind hCG with the same affinity as WT LHR (10.Rivero-Müller A. Chou Y.Y. Ji I. Lajic S. Hanyaloglu A.C. Jonas K. Rahman N. Ji T.H. Huhtaniemi I. Rescue of defective G protein-coupled receptor function in vivo by intermolecular cooperation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2319-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) in part supports this assumption. Prediction of likely architectures of LHR dimers/oligomers followed a computational approach developed for quaternary structure predictions of transmembrane α-helical proteins (30.Casciari D. Seeber M. Fanelli F. Quaternary structure predictions of transmembrane proteins starting from the monomer: a docking-based approach.BMC Bioinformatics. 2006; 7: 340Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The approach consisted of rigid-body docking using a version of the ZDOCK p"

https://openalex.org/W1991760073,"Introduction & Objective Microvesicles (MVs) derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been shown to promote angiogenesis. This study was aimed to shed a light on the mechanisms by analyzing the angiogenesis-promoting compositions of MSC-MVs. Also we try to figure out the impact of hypoxia on angiogenesis. Methods MVs were isolated from the culture supernatants of MSCs under hypoxia/normoxia and serum-deprivation condition. The morphological features of MVs were revealed by an electron microscope and the origin of the MVs was identified by a bead-bound assay. An antibody array was used to analyze the expression of angiogenic cytokines from MVs and the parent MSCs as well. The major candidate factors were screened and the results were validated by immune blotting. Results MSC-MVs were around 80 nm in diameter. They expressed CD29, CD44, and CD73, but not CD31 and CD45. Antibody array showed that both MSCs and MVs expressed many angiogenesis-promoting biomolecules, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGF), and recptor of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (UPAR). MSC-MVs contained angiogenin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and the receptor-2 for vascular endothelial growth factor at higher levels than the parent MSCs. Under hypoxic condition most cytokines were expressed in greater quantity than normoxic in MSCs while in MVs there was no significant difference between hypoxic and normoxic conditions except UPAR, Angiogenin, VEGF, IGF, Tie-2/TEK, and IL-6 which were higher in MVs under hypoxic conditions than those in normoxic condition. Conclusion Upon serum-deprivation condition, MSCs could secrete MVs that contain a variety of factors contributing to their angiogenesis-promoting function. And among them, Angiogenin, VEGF, MCP-1, VEGF R2 might be of greater importance than the other cytokines. Also UPAR, Angiogenin, VEGF, IGF, Tie-2/TEK, IL-6 might be responsible for hypoxia-augmented proangiogenic effects of MVs."
https://openalex.org/W1990617849,"Incubation temperature has significant developmental effects on oviparous animals, including affecting sexual differentiation for several species. Incubation temperature also affects traits that can influence survival, a theory that is verified in this study for the Northwest Atlantic loggerhead sea turtle (Caretta caretta). We conducted controlled laboratory incubations and experiments to test for an effect of incubation temperature on performance of loggerhead hatchlings. Sixty-eight hatchlings were tested in 2011, and 31 in 2012, produced from eggs incubated at 11 different constant temperatures ranging from 27°C to 33°C. Following their emergence from the eggs, we tested righting response, crawling speed, and conducted a 24-hour long swim test. The results support previous studies on sea turtle hatchlings, with an effect of incubation temperature seen on survivorship, righting response time, crawling speed, change in crawl speed, and overall swim activity, and with hatchlings incubated at 27°C showing decreased locomotor abilities. No hatchlings survived to be tested in both years when incubated at 32°C and above. Differences in survivorship of hatchlings incubated at high temperatures are important in light of projected higher sand temperatures due to climate change, and could indicate increased mortality from incubation temperature effects."
https://openalex.org/W2058703287,"Activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) is associated with the binding of agonists such as acetylcholine to an extracellular site that is located at the interface between two adjacent receptor subunits. More recently, there has been considerable interest in compounds, such as positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs), that are able to modulate nAChR function by binding to distinct allosteric sites. Here we examined a series of compounds differing only in methyl substitution of a single aromatic ring. This series of compounds includes a previously described α7-selective allosteric agonist, cis-cis-4-p-tolyl-3a,4,5,9b-tetrahydro-3H-cyclopenta[c]quinoline-8-sulfonamide (4MP-TQS), together with all other possible combinations of methyl substitution at a phenyl ring (18 additional compounds). Studies conducted with this series of compounds have revealed five distinct pharmacological effects on α7 nAChRs. These five effects can be summarized as: 1) nondesensitizing activation (allosteric agonists), 2) potentiation associated with minimal effects on receptor desensitization (type I PAMs), 3) potentiation associated with reduced desensitization (type II PAMs), 4) noncompetitive antagonism (NAMs), and 5) compounds that have no effect on orthosteric agonist responses but block allosteric modulation (silent allosteric modulators (SAMs)). Several lines of experimental evidence are consistent with all of these compounds acting at a common, transmembrane allosteric site. Notably, all of these chemically similar compounds that have been classified as nondesensitizing allosteric agonists or as nondesensitizing (type II) PAMs are cis-cis-diastereoisomers, whereas all of the NAMs, SAMs, and type I PAMs are cis-trans-diastereoisomers. Our data illustrate the remarkable pharmacological diversity of allosteric modulators acting on nAChRs.Background: Nicotinic receptors are activated by acetylcholine and have been implicated in several neurological disorders.Results: Allosteric modulators, sharing close chemical similarity, exhibit five distinct pharmacological effects on α7 nicotinic receptors.Conclusion: Small changes in chemical structure have profound effects on the pharmacological properties of allosteric modulators.Significance: These findings may provide opportunities for novel approaches to therapeutic drug discovery.

In common with other Cys loop receptors, nAChRs are pentameric complexes in which five transmembrane subunits co-assemble to form a central ion channel (2Nys M. Kesters D. Ulens C.

Although all nAChRs share a similar three-dimensional structure (4Unwin N. Refined structure of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at 4 Å resolution.J. Mol.

Mammalian nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: from structure to function.Physiol. Rev. 2009; 89: 73-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar), there is considerable diversity in their subunit composition. For example, in mammalian species, there are 16 nAChR subunits (α1–α7, α9, α10, β1–β4, γ, δ, and ϵ) that can co-assemble to generate a diverse family of nAChR subtypes (6Gotti C. Clementi F.

In addition, some nAChR subunits (such as α7) form functional homomeric nAChRs, containing five copies of the same subunit (8Couturier S. Bertrand D. Matter J.M. Hernandez M.C. Bertrand S. Millar N.

The human α7 nAChR has been identified as a potential target for therapeutic drug discovery and has been implicated in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders (9Leonard S. Freedman R.

The α7 nAChR is somewhat atypical of this receptor family, in that it undergoes very rapid desensitization in response to activation by its endogenous neurotransmitter acetylcholine (8Couturier S.

However, allosteric modulation can facilitate activation of α7 nAChRs with only low levels of desensitization (14Hurst R.S. Hajós M. Raggenbass M. Wall T.M. Higdon N.R. Lawson J.A.

Activation of nAChRs and the opening of the cation-selective pore is associated with the binding of agonists such as acetylcholine to an orthosteric binding site located in the extracellular domain of the receptor at the interface between two adjacent subunits (18Arias H.R. Localization of agonist and competitive antagonist binding sites on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.Neurochem. Int. 2000; 36: 595-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 19Lynagh T. Pless S.A. Principles of agonist recognition in Cys-loop receptors.Front. Physiol. 2014; 5: 160Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In addition, a range of compounds have been identified that can modulate nAChR activation by binding to distinct allosteric sites (20Bertrand D. Gopalakrishnan M. Allosteric modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and may have potential as novel approaches to therapeutic drug discovery (21Pandya A.A. Yakel J.L. Effects of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor allosteric modulators in animal behavior studies.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2013; 86: 1054-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An area that has attracted considerable interest concerns compounds that lack intrinsic agonist activity on nAChRs but are able to potentiate agonist-evoked responses by binding to a distinct allosteric site. Such compounds have been described as positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) and include compounds such as TQS, a PAM that displays selectivity for α7 nAChRs (15Grønlien J.H. Håkerud M. Ween H. Thorin-Hagene K. Briggs C.A. Gopalakrishnan M. Malysz J. Distinct profiles of α7 nAChR positive allosteric modulation revealed by structurally diverse chemotypes.Mol. Pharmacol. 2007; 72: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In the case of rapidly desensitizing nAChRs such as α7, PAMs have been classified as being either type I or type II, depending on whether they cause little or no effect on the rate of agonist-induced desensitization (type I PAMs) or cause a reduction in desensitization (type II PAMs) (20Bertrand D. Gopalakrishnan M. Allosteric modulation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 74: 1155-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22Arias H.R.

Positive allosteric modulators as an approach to nicotinic acetylcholine receptor-targeted therapeutics: advantages and limitations.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2011; 82: 915-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, there is evidence that the binding of ligands to allosteric sites on nAChRs can result in efficient activation of nAChRs in the absence of orthosteric agonists (17Gill J.K. Savolainen M. Young G.T. Zwart R. Sher E. Millar N.S. Agonist activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors via an allosteric transmembrane site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Pharmacol. 2012; 81: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In the case of α7 nAChRs, there is evidence for PAMs and allosteric agonists binding to an intrasubunit cavity located within the transmembrane domain (17Gill J.K. Savolainen M. Young G.T. Zwart R. Sher E. Millar N.S. Agonist activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors via an allosteric transmembrane site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We have shown previously that minor changes in the chemical structure of nAChR allosteric modulators can result in dramatic differences in pharmacological properties (17Gill J.K. Savolainen M. Young G.T. Zwart R. Sher E. Millar N.S. Agonist activation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors via an allosteric transmembrane site.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 5867-5872Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24Gill J.K. Dhankher P. Sheppard T.D. Sher E. Millar N.S. A series of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor allosteric modulators with close chemical similarity but diverse pharmacological properties.Mol. Pharmacol. 2012; 81: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For example, replacing a fluorine atom with a chlorine atom converts an α7-selective PAM into an allosteric agonist (24Gill J.K. Dhankher P. Sheppard T.D. Sher E. Millar N.S. A series of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor allosteric modulators with close chemical similarity but diverse pharmacological properties.Mol. Pharmacol. 2012; 81: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The present study extends these findings, with the aim of identifying the influence of changes in chemical structure on the pharmacological properties of nAChR allosteric modulators. A series of compounds, differing only in methyl substitution of a single aromatic ring, have been examined (see Fig. 1). This series includes an α7-selective allosteric agonist, 4MP-TQS, a compound that has been examined previously (24Gill J.K. Dhankher P. Sheppard T.D. Sher E. Millar N.S. A series of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor allosteric modulators with close chemical similarity but diverse pharmacological properties.Mol. Pharmacol. 2012; 81: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), together with all other possible combinations of methyl substitutions at a single phenyl ring (18 additional compounds). The influence of changes in chemical structure has been examined on α7 nAChRs by means of two-electrode voltage-clamp recording and radioligand binding. Whereas previous studies of compounds with close chemical similarity to TQS have identified only allosteric agonists or type II PAMs (15Grønlien J.H. Håkerud M. Ween H. Thorin-Hagene K. Briggs C.A.

Pharmacol. 2012; 81: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), studies conducted with this series of 19 methyl-substituted compounds have revealed five distinct pharmacological effects on α7 nAChRs. In summary, the 19 methyl-substituted compounds examined in this study can be classified in one of five categories: allosteric agonists, type I PAMs, type II PAMs, negative allosteric modulators (NAMs), or silent allosteric modulators (SAMs). Nineteen compounds were synthesized that differed only in the pattern of methyl substitution of an aromatic substituent located at position 2 of a tetrahydroisoquinoline ring (see Fig. 1). Compounds were prepared by InCl3-catalyzed reaction of sulfanilamide, cyclopentadiene, and the corresponding substituted benzaldehyde, according to methods described previously (27Becker C. Comstock J. Michne W.F. Murphy M. Phillips E. Rosamond J.D. Simpson T.R. Positive modulators of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.2004Google Scholar). The substituted benzaldehydes were either purchased commercially or prepared according to literature procedures (28Dhankher P. Sheppard T.D. A convenient synthesis of tri- and tretramethylbenzaldehydes from readily available phenols.Synlett. 2014; 25: 381-384Google Scholar). In most cases (13 of the 19 compounds), the cis-cis-diastereoisomer was obtained as the major product from the InCl3-catalyzed multicomponent reaction (see Fig. 1). However, in some cases (6 of the 19 compounds), the cis-trans-diastereoisomer was obtained as the major product (see Fig. 1). For all cis-trans-isomers and for two of the cis-cis-isomers, only a single diastereoisomer was detected by 1H NMR. Further details concerning the synthesis of these compounds and the major diastereoisomer obtained for each compound, together with the ratio of isomers present in the purified sample, are provided in the supplemental materials. Several plasmid constructs used in this study have been described previously. These constructs include plasmids containing human wild-type and mutant (M253L) nAChR α7 subunit cDNA constructs in plasmid pSP64GL (17Gill J.K. Savolainen M. Young G.T. Zwart R. Sher E. Millar N.S.

Heterologous expression was achieved by injection of either cRNA (6–12 ng) into oocyte cytoplasm in the case of wild-type and mutated α7 or plasmid cDNA constructs (10–30 ng) into oocyte nuclei in the case of 5-HT3A. In vitro transcription of cRNA was carried out using mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 transcription kit (Ambion, Huntington, UK). Oocytes were injected in a volume of 32.2 nl using a Drummond variable volume microinjector. Two electrode voltage-clamp recordings were performed (with the oocyte membrane potential held at −60 mV), as described previously (33Young G.T. Broad L.M. Zwart R. Astles P.C. Bodkin M. Sher E.

Methyl-TQS compounds were dissolved in DMSO to generate 100 mm stock solutions. Compounds were applied to oocytes using a BPS-8 solenoid valve solution exchange system (ALA Scientific Inc., Westbury, NY), controlled by Chart software. For multiple comparisons of agonist activation rates, statistical significance was determined with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Statistical significance of desensitization rates was determined by paired Student's t tests. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. The activation and desensitization phases of current responses were best fitted by a single exponential function. Human kidney tsA201 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma-Aldrich), penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) (Invitrogen). Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Cells were co-transfected with human α7 nAChR cDNA and C. elegans RIC-3 cDNA using Effectene reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After overnight incubation in Effectene, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h before being assayed for radioligand binding.

Here we investigated 57 Greek-Cypriot families presenting glomerular microscopic hematuria (GMH), with or without proteinuria or chronic kidney function decline, but excluded classical AS. We specifically searched the COL4A3/A4 genes and identified 8 heterozygous mutations in 16 families (28,1%). Eight non-related families featured the founder mutation COL4A3-p.(G1334E). Renal biopsies from 8 patients showed TBMN and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Ten patients (11.5%) reached end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) at ages ranging from 37-69-yo (mean 50,1-yo). Next generation sequencing of the patients who progressed to ESKD failed to reveal a second mutation in any of the COL4A3/A4/A5 genes, supporting that true heterozygosity for COL4A3/A4 mutations predisposes to CRF/ESKD. Although this could be viewed as a milder and late-onset form of autosomal dominant AS, we had no evidence of ultrastructural features or extrarenal manifestations that would justify this diagnosis. Functional studies in cultured podocytes transfected with wild type or mutant COL4A3 chains showed retention of mutant collagens and differential activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) cascade. This signifies the potential role of the UPR cascade in modulating the final phenotype in patients with collagen IV nephropathies."
https://openalex.org/W1991291732,"Tyro3, Axl and Mertk (TAM) receptor tyrosine kinases play multiple functional roles by either providing intrinsic trophic support for cell growth or regulating the expression of target genes that are important in the homeostatic regulation of immune responses. TAM receptors have been shown to regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis by negatively regulation of glial cell activation in central nervous system (CNS). In the present study, we further demonstrated that all three TAM receptors were expressed by cultured primary neural stem cells (NSCs) and played a direct growth trophic role in NSCs proliferation, neuronal differentiation and survival. The cultured primary NSCs lacking TAM receptors exhibited slower growth, reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis as shown by decreased BrdU incorporation and increased TUNEL labeling, than those from the WT NSCs. In addition, the neuronal differentiation and maturation of the mutant NSCs were impeded, as characterized by less neuronal differentiation (β-tubulin III+) and neurite outgrowth than their WT counterparts. To elucidate the underlying mechanism that the TAM receptors play on the differentiating NSCs, we examined the expression profile of neurotrophins and their receptors by real-time qPCR on the total RNAs from hippocampus and primary NSCs; and found that the TKO NSC showed a significant reduction in the expression of both nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but accompanied by compensational increases in the expression of the TrkA, TrkB, TrkC and p75 receptors. These results suggest that TAM receptors support NSCs survival, proliferation and differentiation by regulating expression of neurotrophins, especially the NGF."

L. monocytogenes is considered to be a potential public health risk by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as this bacterium can easily contaminate ready-to-eat (RTE) foods and cause an invasive, life-threatening disease (listeriosis). Bacteria can adhere and grow on multiple surfaces and persist within biofilms in food processing plants, providing resistance to sanitizers and other antimicrobial agents. While whole genome sequencing has led to the identification of biofilm synthesis gene clusters in many bacterial species, bioinformatics has not identified the biofilm synthesis genes within the L. monocytogenes genome. To identify genes necessary for L. monocytogenes biofilm formation, we performed a transposon mutagenesis library screen using a recently constructed Himar1 mariner transposon. Approximately 10,000 transposon mutants within L. monocytogenes strain 10403S were screened for biofilm formation in 96-well polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microtiter plates with 70 Himar1 insertion mutants identified that produced significantly less biofilms. DNA sequencing of the transposon insertion sites within the isolated mutants revealed transposon insertions within 38 distinct genetic loci. The identification of mutants bearing insertions within several flagellar motility genes previously known to be required for the initial stages of biofilm formation validated the ability of the mutagenesis screen to identify L. monocytogenes biofilm-defective mutants. Two newly identified genetic loci, dltABCD and phoPR, were selected for deletion analysis and both ΔdltABCD and ΔphoPR bacterial strains displayed biofilm formation defects in the PVC microtiter plate assay, confirming these loci contribute to biofilm formation by L. monocytogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2042706587,"In moths, which include many agricultural pest species, males are attracted by female-emitted sex pheromones. Although integrated pest management strategies are increasingly developed, most insect pest treatments rely on widespread use of neurotoxic chemicals, including neonicotinoid insecticides. Residual accumulation of low concentrations of these insecticides in the environment is known to be harmful to beneficial insects such as honey bees. This environmental stress probably acts as an “info-disruptor” by modifying the chemical communication system, and therefore decreases chances of reproduction in target insects that largely rely on olfactory communication. However, low doses of pollutants could on the contrary induce adaptive processes in the olfactory pathway, thus enhancing reproduction. Here we tested the effects of acute oral treatments with different low doses of the neonicotinoid clothianidin on the behavioral responses to sex pheromone in the moth Agrotis ipsilon using wind tunnel experiments. We show that low doses of clothianidin induce a biphasic effect on pheromone-guided behavior. Surprisingly, we found a hormetic-like effect, improving orientation behavior at the LD20 dose corresponding to 10 ng clothianidin. On the contrary, a negative effect, disturbing orientation behavior, was elicited by a treatment with a dose below the LD0 dose corresponding to 0.25 ng clothianidin. No clothianidin effect was observed on behavioral responses to plant odor. Our results indicate that risk assessment has to include unexpected effects of residues on the life history traits of pest insects, which could then lead to their adaptation to environmental stress."
https://openalex.org/W2063728336,"Developing a vaccine that overcomes the diversity of HIV-1 is likely to require a strategy that directs antibody (Ab) responses toward conserved regions of the viral Envelope (Env). However, the generation of neutralizing Abs (NAbs) targeting these regions through vaccination has proven to be difficult. One conserved region of particular interest is the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of Env located within the gp41 ectodomain. In order to direct the immune response to this region, the MPER and gp41 ectodomain were expressed separately as N-terminal fusions to the E2 protein of Geobacillus stearothermophilus. The E2 protein acts as a scaffold by self-assembling into 60-mer particles, displaying up to 60 copies of the fused target on the surface. Rabbits were immunized with E2 particles displaying MPER and/or the gp41 ectodomain in conjunction with DNA encoding full-length gp160. Only vaccines including E2 particles displaying MPER elicited MPER-specific Ab responses. NAbs were elicited after two immunizations that largely targeted the V3 loop. To overcome V3 immunodominance in the DNA component, E2 particles displaying MPER were used in conjunction with gp160 DNA lacking hypervariable regions V2, V3, or combined V1V2V3. All rabbits had HIV binding Ab responses and NAbs following the second vaccination. Using HIV-2/HIV-1 MPER chimeric viruses as targets, NAbs were detected in 12/16 rabbits after three immunizations. Low levels of NAbs specific for Tier 1 and 2 viruses were observed in all groups. This study provides evidence that co-immunizing E2 particles displaying MPER and gp160 DNA can focus Ab responses toward conserved regions of Env."
https://openalex.org/W1990318883,"Skeletal muscle atrophy is a severe condition of muscle mass loss. Muscle atrophy is caused by a down-regulation of protein synthesis and by an increase of protein breakdown due to the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy activation. Up-regulation of specific genes, such as the muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase MAFbx, by FoxO transcription factors is essential to initiate muscle protein ubiquitination and degradation during atrophy. HDAC6 is a particular HDAC, which is functionally related to the ubiquitin proteasome system via its ubiquitin binding domain. We show that HDAC6 is up-regulated during muscle atrophy. HDAC6 activation is dependent on the transcription factor FoxO3a, and the inactivation of HDAC6 in mice protects against muscle wasting. HDAC6 is able to interact with MAFbx, a key ubiquitin ligase involved in muscle atrophy. Our findings demonstrate the implication of HDAC6 in skeletal muscle wasting and identify HDAC6 as a new downstream target of FoxO3a in stress response. This work provides new insights in skeletal muscle atrophy development and opens interesting perspectives on HDAC6 as a valuable marker of muscle atrophy and a potential target for pharmacological treatments."
https://openalex.org/W2093155447,"Formyl peptide receptors (FPR) belong to a family of sensors of the immune system that detect microbe-associated molecules and inform various cellular and sensorial mechanisms to the presence of pathogens in the host. Here we demonstrate that Fpr2/3-deficient mice show a distinct profile of behaviour characterised by reduced anxiety in the marble burying and light-dark box paradigms, increased exploratory behaviour in an open-field, together with superior performance on a novel object recognition test. Pharmacological blockade with a formyl peptide receptor antagonist, Boc2, in wild type mice reproduced most of the behavioural changes observed in the Fpr2/3-/- mice, including a significant improvement in novel object discrimination and reduced anxiety in a light/dark shuttle test. These effects were associated with reduced FPR signalling in the gut as shown by the significant reduction in the levels of p-p38. Collectively, these findings suggest that homeostatic FPR signalling exerts a modulatory effect on anxiety-like behaviours. These findings thus suggest that therapies targeting FPRs may be a novel approach to ameliorate behavioural abnormalities present in neuropsychiatric disorders at the cognitive-emotional interface."

Surfactant-derived proteins (SPs) and plasma receptor for advanced-glycation-end-products (RAGE) have been proposed as lung damage markers. Methods Eighty-nine chronic HF and 17 healthy subjects were evaluated by echocardiography, blood parameters, carbon monoxide lung diffusion (DLCO) and cardiopulmonary exercise test. We measured immature SP-B, mature SP-B, SP-A, SP-D and RAGE plasma levels. Results Immature SP-B (arbitrary units), mature SP-A (ng/ml) and SP-D (ng/ml), but not mature SP-B (ng/ml) and RAGE (pg/ml) levels, were higher in HF than in controls [immature SP-B: 15.6 (13.1, 75th–25th interquartile range) Vs. 11.1 (6.4), p<0.01; SP-A, 29.6 (20.1) Vs. 18.3 (13.5), p = 0.01; SP-D: 125 (90) Vs. 78 (58), p<0.01]. Immature SP-B, SP-A, SP-D and RAGE values were related to DLCO, peak oxygen consumption, ventilatory efficiency, and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), whereas plasma mature SP-B was not. The DLCO Vs. immature SP-B correlation was the strongest one. At multivariate analysis, RAGE was associated to age and creatinine, SP-A to DLCO and BNP, SP-D to BNP, mature SP-B to DLCO and creatinine, and immature SP-B only but strongly to DLCO. Conclusions Immature SP-B is the most reliable biological marker of alveolar-capillary membrane function in HF."
https://openalex.org/W1991673162,"Currently available rodent models exhibit characteristics of early diabetic nephropathy (DN) such as hyperfiltration, mesangial expansion, and albuminuria yet features of late DN (hypertension, GFR decline, tubulointerstitial fibrosis) are absent or require a significant time investment for full phenotype development. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to develop a mouse model of advanced DN with hypertension superimposed (HD mice). Mice transgenic for human renin cDNA under the control of the transthyretin promoter (TTRhRen) were employed as a model of angiotensin-dependent hypertension. Diabetes was induced in TTRhRen mice through low dose streptozotocin (HD-STZ mice) or by intercrossing with OVE26 diabetic mice (HD-OVE mice). Both HD-STZ and HD-OVE mice displayed more pronounced increases in urinary albumin levels as compared with their diabetic littermates. Additionally, HD mice displayed renal hypertrophy, advanced glomerular scarring and evidence of tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Both HD-OVE and HD-STZ mice showed evidence of GFR decline as FITC-inulin clearance was decreased compared to hyperfiltering STZ and OVE mice. Taken together our results suggest that HD mice represent a robust model of type I DN that recapitulates key features of human disease which may be significant in studying the pathogenesis of DN and in the assessment of putative therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1993712149,"To examine the effect of ontogeny on metabolic depression in the cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), and to understand how ontogeny and the ability to metabolically depress influence this species' upper thermal tolerance: 1) the metabolic rate of 9°C-acclimated cunner of three size classes [0.2-0.5 g, young of the year (YOY); 3-6 g, small; and 80-120 g, large (adult)] was measured during a 2°C per day decrease in temperature; and 2) the metabolic response of the same three size classes of cunner to an acute thermal challenge [2°C h(-1) from 10°C until Critical Thermal Maximum, CTMax] was examined, and compared to that of the Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua). The onset-temperature for metabolic depression in cunner increased with body size, i.e. from 5°C in YOY cunner to 7°C in adults. In contrast, the extent of metabolic depression was ∼80% (Q10 = ∼15) for YOY fish, ∼65% (Q10 = ∼8) for small fish and ∼55% (Q10 = ∼5) for adults, and this resulted in the metabolic scaling exponent (b) gradually increasing from 0.84 to 0.92 between 9°C to 1°C. All size classes of cunner had significantly (approximately 60%) lower routine metabolic rates at 10°C than Atlantic cod. However, there was no species' difference in the temperature-induced maximum metabolic rate, and this resulted in factorial metabolic scope values that were more than two-fold greater for cunner, and CTMax values that were 6-9°C higher (∼21 vs. 28°C). These results: 1) show that ontogeny influences the temperature of initiation and the extent of metabolic depression in cunner, but not O2 consumption when in a hypometabolic state; and 2) suggest that the evolution of cold-induced metabolic depression in this northern wrasse species has not resulted in a trade-off with upper thermal tolerance, but instead, an enhancement of this species' metabolic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W1967738433,"A full-sine (biphasic) pulse waveform is most commonly used for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), but little is known about how variations in duration or amplitude of distinct pulse segments influence the effectiveness of a single TMS pulse to elicit a corticomotor response. Using a novel TMS device, we systematically varied the configuration of full-sine pulses to assess the impact of configuration changes on resting motor threshold (RMT) as measure of stimulation effectiveness with single-pulse TMS of the non-dominant motor hand area (M1). In young healthy volunteers, we (i) compared monophasic, half-sine, and full-sine pulses, (ii) applied two-segment pulses consisting of two identical half-sines, and (iii) manipulated amplitude, duration, and current direction of the first or second full-sine pulse half-segments. RMT was significantly higher using half-sine or monophasic pulses compared with full-sine. Pulses combining two half-sines of identical polarity and duration were also characterized by higher RMT than full-sine stimuli resulting. For full-sine stimuli, decreasing the amplitude of the half-segment inducing posterior-anterior oriented current in M1 resulted in considerably higher RMT, whereas varying the amplitude of the half-segment inducing anterior-posterior current had a smaller effect. These findings provide direct experimental evidence that the pulse segment inducing a posterior-anterior directed current in M1 contributes most to corticospinal pathway excitation. Preferential excitation of neuronal target cells in the posterior-anterior segment or targeting of different neuronal structures by the two half-segments can explain this result. Thus, our findings help understanding the mechanisms of neural stimulation by full-sine TMS."
https://openalex.org/W1977988678,"Psychosocial stress is well known to be positively associated with subsequent depressive symptoms. Cortisol response to stress may be one of a number of biological mechanisms that links psychological stress to depressive symptoms, although the precise causal pathway remains unclear. Activity of the x-linked serotonin 5-HTR2C receptor has also been shown to be associated with depression and with clinical response to antidepressant medications. We recently demonstrated that variation in a single nucleotide polymorphism on the HTR2C gene, rs6318 (Ser23Cys), is associated with different cortisol release and short-term changes in affect in response to a series of stress tasks in the laboratory. Based on this observation, we decided to examine whether rs6318 might moderate the association between psychosocial stress and subsequent depressive symptoms. In the present study we use cross-sectional data from a large population-based sample of young adult White men (N = 2,366) and White women (N = 2,712) in the United States to test this moderation hypothesis. Specifically, we hypothesized that the association between self-reported stressful life events and depressive symptoms would be stronger among homozygous Ser23 C females and hemizygous Ser23 C males than among Cys23 G carriers. In separate within-sex analyses a genotype-by-life stress interaction was observed for women (p = .022) but not for men (p = .471). Homozygous Ser23 C women who reported high levels of life stress had depressive symptom scores that were about 0.3 standard deviations higher than female Cys23 G carriers with similarly high stress levels. In contrast, no appreciable difference in depressive symptoms was observed between genotypes at lower levels of stress. Our findings support prior work that suggests a functional SNP on the HTR2C gene may confer an increased risk for depressive symptoms in White women with a history of significant life stress."
https://openalex.org/W1985654240,"Hupehsuchia is a group of enigmatic Triassic marine reptiles that is known exclusively from two counties in Hubei Province, China. One of the common features of the group was a modestly long neck with nine to ten cervical vertebrae. We report a new species of Hupehsuchia, Eohupehsuchus brevicollis gen. et sp. nov., which for the first time shows a short neck in this group, with six cervicals. The configuration of the skull roof in Eohupehsuchus is also unique among Hupehsuchia, with narrow frontals and posteriorly shifted parietals, warranting recognition of a new species. The taxon superficially resembles Nanchangosaurus in retaining hupehsuchian plesiomorphies, such as low neural spines and small body size. However, its limbs are well-developed, unlike in Nanchangosaurus, although the latter genus is marginally larger in body length. Thus, the individual is unlikely to be immature. Also, Eohupehsuchus shares a suite of synapomorphies with Hupehsuchus, including the second and third layers of dermal ossicles above the dorsal neural spines. A phylogenetic analysis suggests that the new species is not the most basal hupehsuchian despite its short neck, and instead forms the sister taxon of Hupehsuchidae. Until recently, Hupehsuchia contained only two monotypic genera. Now there are at least four genera among Hupehsuchia, and the undescribed diversity is even higher. The left forelimb of the only specimen is incomplete, ending with broken phalanges distally. The breakage could only have occurred pre-burial. The individual may have been attacked by a predator and escaped, given that scavenging is unlikely."
https://openalex.org/W2062611278,"In contrast to the deep subseafloor biosphere, a volumetrically vast and stable habitat for microbial life in the terrestrial crust remains poorly explored. For the long-term sustainability of a crustal biome, high-energy fluxes derived from hydrothermal circulation and water radiolysis in uranium-enriched rocks are seemingly essential. However, the crustal habitability depending on a low supply of energy is unknown. We present multi-isotopic evidence of microbially mediated sulfate reduction in a granitic aquifer, a representative of the terrestrial crust habitat. Deep meteoric groundwater was collected from underground boreholes drilled into Cretaceous Toki granite (central Japan). A large sulfur isotopic fractionation of 20–60‰ diagnostic to microbial sulfate reduction is associated with the investigated groundwater containing sulfate below 0.2 mM. In contrast, a small carbon isotopic fractionation (<30‰) is not indicative of methanogenesis. Except for 2011, the concentrations of H2 ranged mostly from 1 to 5 nM, which is also consistent with an aquifer where a terminal electron accepting process is dominantly controlled by ongoing sulfate reduction. High isotopic ratios of mantle-derived 3He relative to radiogenic 4He in groundwater and the flux of H2 along adjacent faults suggest that, in addition to low concentrations of organic matter (<70 µM), H2 from deeper sources might partly fuel metabolic activities. Our results demonstrate that the deep biosphere in the terrestrial crust is metabolically active and playing a crucial role in the formation of reducing groundwater even under low-energy fluxes."
https://openalex.org/W2072011282,"Using inadequate management tools often threatens the natural environment. This study focuses on the example of Swiss recreational fishermen (hereafter called ""anglers"") as recreational fisheries management stakeholders. In recreational fisheries, fish stocking conducted by anglers has been identified as one important factor associated with declining fish catches. We therefore aimed to a) gain insights into why anglers want to maintain fish stocking and b) identify entry points for interventions to promote more pro-ecological management practices. Results (N = 349) showed that the majority of anglers think very uncritically about stocking and that they frequently engage in it. We conclude that outcome expectancies and beliefs about risks, in combination with a lack of stocking success controls are the main reasons that anglers retain stocking measures. We suggest that providing anglers with direct experience and feedback about stocking success is suitable to change their intentions regarding stocking and their actual stocking behavior, and thus, to promote more pro-ecological management methods. From a more general perspective, the results of this study are likely to help improve pro-ecological ecosystem management in other domains where problems similar to those in recreational fisheries management might exist."

In this study, we investigated the effects of rTp0965 on the endothelial barrier. Treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with rTp0965 resulted in increased levels of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and MCP-1 mRNA and protein expression. These increases contributed to the adhesion and chemataxis of monocytes (THP-1 cells) to HUVECs preincubated with rTp0965. In addition, rTp0965 induced reorganization of F-actin and decreased expression of claudin-1 in HUVECs. Interestingly, inhibition of the RhoA/ROCK signal pathway protected against rTp0965-induced higher endothelial permeability as well as transendothelial migration of monocytes. These data indicate that Tp0965 protein may play an important role in the immunopathogenesis of syphilis."

However, little is known about the hierarchy of cells and the unique molecular properties of stem- and progenitor cells of the nervous system. Stem cells from the adult human brain can be propagated and expanded in vitro as free floating neurospheres that are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into all three cell types of the central nervous system. Here we report the first global gene expression study of adult human neural stem-like cells originating from five human subventricular zone biopsies (mean age 42, range 33–60). Compared to adult human brain tissue, we identified 1,189 genes that were significantly up- and down-regulated in adult human neural stem-like cells (1% false discovery rate). We found that adult human neural stem-like cells express stem cell markers and have reduced levels of markers that are typical of the mature cells in the nervous system. We report that the genes being highly expressed in adult human neural stem-like cells are associated with developmental processes and the extracellular region of the cell. The calcium signaling pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions are enriched among the most differentially regulated genes between adult human neural stem-like cells and adult human brain tissue. We confirmed the expression of 10 of the most up-regulated genes in adult human neural stem-like cells in an additional sample set that included adult human neural stem-like cells (n = 6), foetal human neural stem cells (n = 1) and human brain tissues (n = 12). The NGFR, SLITRK6 and KCNS3 receptors were further investigated by immunofluorescence and shown to be heterogeneously expressed in spheres.

We tested whether bill morphology of free-living birds has changed since large-scale releases of farmed mallards started. Three groups of mallards from Sweden, Norway and Finland were compared: historical wild (before large-scale releases started), present-day wild, and present-day farmed. Higher density of bill lamellae was observed in historical wild mallards (only males). Farmed mallards had wider bills than present-day and historical wild ones. Present-day wild and farmed mallards also had higher and shorter bills than historical wild mallards. Present-day mallards thus tend to have more “goose-like” bills (wider, higher, and shorter) than their ancestors. Our study suggests that surviving released mallards affect morphological traits in wild population by introgression. We discuss how such anthropogenic impact may lead to a maladapted and genetically compromised wild mallard population. Our study system has bearing on other taxa where large-scale releases of conspecifics with ‘alien genes’ may cause a cryptic invasive process that nevertheless has fitness consequences for individual birds."

This exploratory study investigated the association among urinary perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate concentrations and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in the general U.S. population.We analyzed data on 4265 adults (aged 20 years and older) from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey in 2005 through 2006 to evaluate the relationship among urinary perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate concentration and PTH levels and the presence of hyperparathyroidism cross-sectionally.The geometric means and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) concentrations of urinary perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate were 3.38 (3.15-3.62), 40363 (37512-43431), and 1129 (1029-1239) ng/mL, respectively. After adjusting for confounding variables and sample weights, creatinine-corrected urinary perchlorate was negatively associated with serum PTH levels in women (P = 0.001), and creatinine-corrected urinary nitrate and thiocyanate were negatively associated with serum PTH levels in both sex groups (P = 0.001 and P<0.001 for men, P = 0.018 and P<0.001 for women, respectively). Similar results were obtained from sensitivity analyses performed for exposure variables unadjusted for creatinine with urinary creatinine added as a separate covariate. There was a negative relationship between hyperparathyroidism and urinary nitrate and thiocyanate [odds ratio (95% CI) = 0.77 (0.60-0.98) and 0.69 (0.61-0.79), respectively].A higher urinary concentration of perchlorate, nitrate, and thiocyanate is associated with lower serum PTH levels.

High-throughput techniques, such as transcriptome analysis, are becoming important tools for genetic biomarker discovery in highly complex biological samples, which is critical for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of disease. In the present study, we reported one type of transcriptome analysis method: digital gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 10 RA patients, 10 CAD patients and 10 healthy people. In all, 213 and 152 differently expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in RA patients compared with normal controls (RA vs. normal) and CAD patients compared with normal controls (CAD vs. normal), respectively, with 73 shared DEGs between them. Using this technique in combination with Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software, the effects on inflammation of four shared canonical pathways, three shared activated predicted upstream regulators and three shared molecular interaction networks were identified and explored. These shared molecular mechanisms may provide the genetic basis and potential targets for optimizing the application of current drugs to more effectively treat these diseases simultaneously and for preventing one when the other is diagnosed."
https://openalex.org/W2084198777,"LOX-1, lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-1, is a single transmembrane receptor mainly expressed on endothelial cells. LOX-1 mediates the uptake of oxidized LDL, an early step in atherosclerosis; however, little is known about whether LOX-1 is involved in angiogenesis during tissue ischemia. Therefore, we examined the role of LOX-1 in ischemia-induced angiogenesis in the hindlimbs of LOX-1 knockout (KO) mice. Angiogenesis was evaluated in a surgically induced hindlimb ischemia model using laser Doppler blood flowmetry (LDBF) and histological capillary density (CD) and arteriole density (AD). After right hindlimb ischemia, the ischemic/nonischemic hindlimb blood flow ratio was persistently lower in LOX-1 KO mice than in wild-type (WT) mice. CD and AD were significantly smaller in LOX-1 KO mice than in WT mice on postoperative day 14. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the number of macrophages infiltrating ischemic tissues was significantly smaller in LOX-1 KO mice than in WT mice. The number of infiltrated macrophages expressing VEGF was also significantly smaller in LOX-1 KO mice than in WT mice. Western blot analysis and ROS production assay revealed that LOX- KO mice show significant decrease in Nox2 expression, ROS production and HIF-1α expression, the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and NF-κB p65 subunit as well as expression of redox-sensitive vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and LOX-1 itself in ischemic muscles, which is supposed to be required for macrophage infiltration expressing angiogenic factor VEGF. Reduction of VEGF expression successively suppressed the phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS, which accelerated angiogenesis, in the ischemic leg of LOX-1 KO mice. Our findings indicate that LOX-1 plays an important role in ischemia-induced angiogenesis by 1) Nox2-ROS-NF-κB activation, 2) upregulated expression of adhesion molecules: VCAM-1 and LOX-1 and 3) promoting macrophage infiltration, which expresses angiogenic factor VEGF."

Numerous environmental exposures during 3 age intervals; 0-5, 6-10 and 11-18 years were extracted using an investigator administered questionnaire. An agreement analysis was performed to determine the reliability of questionnaire data for all the relevant variables.This study included 194 CD patients and 213 controls. On multiple logistic regression analysis, a number of childhood environmental exposures during the 3 age interval were significantly associated with the risk of developing CD. During the age interval 6-10 years, never having had consumed unpasteurized milk (OR = 5.84; 95% CI, 2.73-13.53) and never having a donkey, horse, sheep or cow on the property (OR = 2.48; 95% CI, 1.09-5.98) significantly increased the risk of developing future CD. During the age interval 11-18 years, an independent risk-association was identified for; never having consumed unpasteurized milk (OR = 2.60; 95% CI, 1.17-6.10) and second-hand cigarette smoke exposure (OR = 1.93; 95% CI, 1.13-3.35).This study demonstrates that both limited microbial exposures and exposure to second-hand cigarette smoke during childhood is associated with future development of CD."
https://openalex.org/W2080960522,"Surface expression of voltage-gated Ca2+ (Cav) channels is important for their function in calcium homeostasis in the physiology of excitable cells, but whether or not and how the α1 pore-forming subunits of Cav channels are trafficked to plasma membrane in the absence of the known Cav auxiliary subunits, β and α2δ, remains mysterious. Here we showed that 14-3-3 proteins promoted functional surface expression of the Cav2.2 α1B channel in transfected tsA-201 cells in the absence of any known Cav auxiliary subunit. Both the surface to total ratio of the expressed α1B protein and the current density of voltage step-evoked Ba2+ current were markedly suppressed by the coexpression of a 14-3-3 antagonist construct, pSCM138, but not its inactive control, pSCM174, as determined by immunofluorescence assay and whole cell voltage clamp recording, respectively. By contrast, coexpression with 14-3-3τ significantly enhanced the surface expression and current density of the Cav2.2 α1B channel. Importantly, we found that between the two previously identified 14-3-3 binding regions at the α1B C terminus, only the proximal region (amino acids 1706–1940), closer to the end of the last transmembrane domain, was retained by the endoplasmic reticulum and facilitated by 14-3-3 to traffic to plasma membrane. Additionally, we showed that the 14-3-3/Cav β subunit coregulated the surface expression of Cav2.2 channels in transfected tsA-201 cells and neurons. Altogether, our findings reveal a previously unidentified regulatory function of 14-3-3 proteins in promoting the surface expression of Cav2.2 α1B channels.Background: The mechanism and dynamics of Cav channels trafficking remains mysterious.Results: 14-3-3τ promotes Cav2.2 trafficking independent of Cav auxiliary subunits.Conclusion: 14-3-3τ enhances Cav2.2 trafficking by masking the ER retention signal at its proximal C-terminal region.Significance: Uncovering the regulation of Cav2.2 trafficking may contribute to understanding the Cav2.2 surface expression and functional control under physiological and pathophysiological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2154666237,"The G-protein coupled chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor CXCR4 is linked to cancer, HIV, and WHIM (Warts, Hypogammaglobulinemia, Infections, and Myelokathexis) syndrome. While CXCR4 is reported to be overexpressed in multiple human cancer types and many hematological cancer cell lines, we have observed poor in vitro cell surface expression of CXCR4 in many solid tumor cell lines. We explore further the possible factors and pathways involved in regulating CXCR4 expression. Here, we showed that MEK-ERK signaling pathway and NFAT3 transcriptional factor plays a novel role in regulating CXCR4 expression. When cultured as 3D spheroids, HeyA8 ovarian tumor cells showed a dramatic increase in surface CXCR4 protein levels as well as mRNA transcripts. Furthermore, HeyA8 3D spheroids showed a decrease in phospho-ERK levels when compared to adherent cells. The treatment of adherent HeyA8 cells with an inhibitor of the MEK-ERK pathway, U0126, resulted in a significant increase in surface CXCR4 expression. Additional investigation using the PCR array assay comparing adherent to 3D spheroid showed a wide range of transcription factors being up-regulated, most notably a > 20 fold increase in NFAT3 transcription factor mRNA. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that direct binding of NFAT3 on the CXCR4 promoter corresponds to increased CXCR4 expression in HeyA8 ovarian cell line. Taken together, our results suggest that high phospho-ERK levels and NFAT3 expression plays a novel role in regulating CXCR4 expression."

https://openalex.org/W2032818594,"The Shoc2 protein has been implicated in the positive regulation of the Ras-ERK pathway by increasing the functional binding interaction between Ras and Raf, leading to increased ERK activity. Here we found that Shoc2 overexpression induced sustained ERK phosphorylation, notably in the case of EGF stimulation, and Shoc2 knockdown inhibited ERK activation. We demonstrate that ectopic overexpression of human Shoc2 in PC12 cells significantly promotes neurite extension in the presence of EGF, a stimulus that induces proliferation rather than differentiation in these cells. Finally, Shoc2 depletion reduces both NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and ERK activation in PC12 cells. Our data indicate that Shoc2 is essential to modulate the Ras-ERK signaling outcome in cell differentiation processes involved in neurite outgrowth."

https://openalex.org/W1995788872,"Small-interfering RNAs and microRNAs are small ∼21–22 nucleotide long RNAs capable of posttranscriptional suppression of gene expression. The synthetic siRNAs are especially designed to target pre-specified genes and are common molecular biology tools. The miRNAs are endogenous regulators of gene expression found in a wide variety of eukaryotes. miRNAs are currently utilized for diagnostics applications. Therapeutically, various miRNA-antagonizing tools are being explored and miRNAs are also utilized for cell-specific inhibition of the expression of gene therapy vectors harboring target sites for specific miRNAs. Here we show, for the first time, that siRNAs and miRNAs can be harnessed to induce gene expression. We designed special expression vectors in which target sites for artificial siRNAs or endogenous miRNAs are located between the transgene and an Upstream Inhibitory Region (UIR). We hypothesized that cleavage of the mRNA by siRNAs or miRNAs will separate the transgene from the UIR and the resulting uncapped mRNA will be capable of being translated. A UIR composed of seven open reading frames was found to be the most efficient inhibitor of the translation of the downstream transgene. We show that under such a configuration both artificial siRNAs and endogenous miRNAs were capable of inducing transgene expression. We show that using the diphtheria toxin A-chain gene, in combination with target sites for highly expressed miRNAs, specific induction of cell-death can be achieved, setting the stage for application to cancer therapy."
