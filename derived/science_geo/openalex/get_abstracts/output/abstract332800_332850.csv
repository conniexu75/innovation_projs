https://openalex.org/W2027273811,"Western scientists and students of history have long explaind th iron bloomery process by evidence available from European archeology. Ethnographic, technological, and archeological research into the technological life of the Haya of northwestern Tanzania show that these people and their forebears 1500 to 2000 years ago practiced a highly advanced iron smelting technology based on preheating principles and, as a result, produced carbon steel. This sophisticated technology may have evolved as an adaptation to overexploited forest resources. These discoveries are significant for the history of Africa and the history of metallurgy."
https://openalex.org/W1993929272,Silicate spherules produced by atmospheric melting of meteoric bodies are probably the most common form of extraterrestrial material on the earth. It has never been possible to positively identify such particles although it has been known for more than a century that silicate spherules of suspected extraterrestrial origin are present in deep-sea sediments. One such spherule has been identified as definitely extraterrestrial since its abundances of nonvolatile trace elements closely match those of primitive solar system material.
https://openalex.org/W2094708092,"Transformations involving a change from tetrahedrally coordinated to octahedrally coordinated silicon (IVSi → VISi) are observed to occur at high pressure when the mean IVSi-O bond compresses to approximately 1.59 angstroms based on known room-pressure crystal structures, Si-O bond compressibilities, and pressures of IVSi → VISi transformations. The lower two-thirds of the mantle transition zone of high-density gradient (500 to 900 kilometers) corresponds to the predicted range of IVSi → VISi transformations. The 10 percent density increase of this zone at zero pressure is attributed primarily to the density increase associated with the change in silicon coordination. Below 900 kilometers all silicon is predicted to be in octahedral or greater coordination. The concept of cation polyhedral stability fields is defined."

https://openalex.org/W2079994323,A plan for the genetic improvement of commercially exploited wild animals is presented. It consists of crossing wild with domesticated breeds to produce heterotic hybrids and to upgrade the wild stocks. Empirical evidence is presented from experiments with the carp. Procedures for monitoring the manipulated populations are outlined. The suggested plan is ecologically reasonable and would counteract the negative genetic changes caused by excessive commercial exploitation of many species.
https://openalex.org/W2035471273,"In three articles, Science will discuss how the creep of technology affects the arms race. The first two articles will deal with the most important current example: first, how ICBM modernization is giving both sides a destabilizing, first-strike capability, and second, how arms control seems to be dealing inadequately with this pressing problem. The third article will describe other cases of incremental technical improvements affecting arms control, such as antisatellite research and ballistic missile defense research, which are bringing both sides closer to the antiballistic missile capability they forswore in a 1972 treaty."
