Wang et al. (p. 614 ) encapsulated graphene with hexagonal boron nitride sheets and made metal contacts along its edge, where bonding orbitals are exposed. The resulting heterostructures had high electronic performance, with room-temperature carrier mobilities near the theoretical phonon-scattering limit."
https://openalex.org/W2118970626,"Short sequencing reads are scaffolded into chromosome-scale sequences with the help of chromatin-interaction data. Genomes assembled de novo from short reads are highly fragmented relative to the finished chromosomes of Homo sapiens and key model organisms generated by the Human Genome Project. To address this problem, we need scalable, cost-effective methods to obtain assemblies with chromosome-scale contiguity. Here we show that genome-wide chromatin interaction data sets, such as those generated by Hi-C, are a rich source of long-range information for assigning, ordering and orienting genomic sequences to chromosomes, including across centromeres. To exploit this finding, we developed an algorithm that uses Hi-C data for ultra-long-range scaffolding of de novo genome assemblies. We demonstrate the approach by combining shotgun fragment and short jump mate-pair sequences with Hi-C data to generate chromosome-scale de novo assemblies of the human, mouse and Drosophila genomes, achieving—for the human genome—98% accuracy in assigning scaffolds to chromosome groups and 99% accuracy in ordering and orienting scaffolds within chromosome groups. Hi-C data can also be used to validate chromosomal translocations in cancer genomes."
https://openalex.org/W2000885937,"HIV-1 entry into CD4(+) target cells is mediated by cleaved envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimers that have been challenging to characterize structurally. Here, we describe the crystal structure at 4.7 angstroms of a soluble, cleaved Env trimer that is stabilized and antigenically near-native (termed the BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140 trimer) in complex with a potent broadly neutralizing antibody, PGT122. The structure shows a prefusion state of gp41, the interaction between the component gp120 and gp41 subunits, and how a close association between the gp120 V1/V2/V3 loops stabilizes the trimer apex around the threefold axis. The complete epitope of PGT122 on the trimer involves gp120 V1, V3, and several surrounding glycans. This trimer structure advances our understanding of how Env functions and is presented to the immune system, and provides a blueprint for structure-based vaccine design."

Using a structure-based approach, McLellan et al. (p. 592 ) designed over 150 fusion glycoprotein variants, assessed their antibody reactivity, determined crystal structures of stabilized variants, and measured their ability to elicit protective responses. This approach yielded an immunogen that elicits higher protective responses than the postfusion form of the fusion glycoprotein, which is one of the current leading RSV vaccine candidates entering clinical trials. Importantly, highly protective responses were elicited in both mice and macaques."
https://openalex.org/W1987908519,"Aneuploidy has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer for more than 100 years, yet no general theory to explain the recurring patterns of aneuploidy in cancer has emerged. Here, we develop Tumor Suppressor and Oncogene (TUSON) Explorer, a computational method that analyzes the patterns of mutational signatures in tumors and predicts the likelihood that any individual gene functions as a tumor suppressor (TSG) or oncogene (OG). By analyzing >8,200 tumor-normal pairs, we provide statistical evidence suggesting that many more genes possess cancer driver properties than anticipated, forming a continuum of oncogenic potential. Integrating our driver predictions with information on somatic copy number alterations, we find that the distribution and potency of TSGs (STOP genes), OGs, and essential genes (GO genes) on chromosomes can predict the complex patterns of aneuploidy and copy number variation characteristic of cancer genomes. We propose that the cancer genome is shaped through a process of cumulative haploinsufficiency and triplosensitivity."

As the only target for broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs), Env is a focus for rational vaccine design. We present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction and structural model of a cleaved, soluble Env trimer (termed BG505 SOSIP.664 gp140) in complex with a CD4 binding site (CD4bs) bnAb, PGV04, at 5.8 angstrom resolution. The structure reveals the spatial arrangement of Env components, including the V1/V2, V3, HR1, and HR2 domains, as well as shielding glycans. The structure also provides insights into trimer assembly, gp120-gp41 interactions, and the CD4bs epitope cluster for bnAbs, which covers a more extensive area and defines a more complex site of vulnerability than previously described."

https://openalex.org/W2159220884,"Malignant melanomas harbouring point mutations (Val600Glu) in the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) depend on RAF-MEK-ERK signalling for tumour cell growth. RAF and MEK inhibitors show remarkable clinical efficacy in BRAF(V600E) melanoma; however, resistance to these agents remains a formidable challenge. Global characterization of resistance mechanisms may inform the development of more effective therapeutic combinations. Here we carried out systematic gain-of-function resistance studies by expressing more than 15,500 genes individually in a BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell line treated with RAF, MEK, ERK or combined RAF-MEK inhibitors. These studies revealed a cyclic-AMP-dependent melanocytic signalling network not previously associated with drug resistance, including G-protein-coupled receptors, adenyl cyclase, protein kinase A and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Preliminary analysis of biopsies from BRAF(V600E) melanoma patients revealed that phosphorylated (active) CREB was suppressed by RAF-MEK inhibition but restored in relapsing tumours. Expression of transcription factors activated downstream of MAP kinase and cAMP pathways also conferred resistance, including c-FOS, NR4A1, NR4A2 and MITF. Combined treatment with MAPK-pathway and histone-deacetylase inhibitors suppressed MITF expression and cAMP-mediated resistance. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic dysregulation of a melanocyte lineage dependency can cause resistance to RAF-MEK-ERK inhibition, which may be overcome by combining signalling- and chromatin-directed therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W1995794660,"Genetic variants are grouped into chromosome-spanning haplotypes with the help of chromatin-interaction data. Rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing facilitate variant discovery and genotyping, but linking variants into a single haplotype remains challenging. Here we demonstrate HaploSeq, an approach for assembling chromosome-scale haplotypes by exploiting the existence of 'chromosome territories'. We use proximity ligation and sequencing to show that alleles on homologous chromosomes occupy distinct territories, and therefore this experimental protocol preferentially recovers physically linked DNA variants on a homolog. Computational analysis of such data sets allows for accurate (∼99.5%) reconstruction of chromosome-spanning haplotypes for ∼95% of alleles in hybrid mouse cells with 30× sequencing coverage. To resolve haplotypes for a human genome, which has a low density of variants, we coupled HaploSeq with local conditional phasing to obtain haplotypes for ∼81% of alleles with ∼98% accuracy from just 17× sequencing. Whereas methods based on proximity ligation were originally designed to investigate spatial organization of genomes, our results lend support for their use as a general tool for haplotyping."
https://openalex.org/W2069647329,"The microscopically complicated real world exhibits behavior that often yields to simple yet quantitatively accurate descriptions. Predictions are possible despite large uncertainties in microscopic parameters, both in physics and in multiparameter models in other areas of science. We connect the two by analyzing parameter sensitivities in a prototypical continuum theory (diffusion) and at a self-similar critical point (the Ising model). We trace the emergence of an effective theory for long-scale observables to a compression of the parameter space quantified by the eigenvalues of the Fisher Information Matrix. A similar compression appears ubiquitously in models taken from diverse areas of science, suggesting that the parameter space structure underlying effective continuum and universal theories in physics also permits predictive modeling more generally."

(p. 637 ) prevented resident stem cells from proliferating after spinal cord injury. Without the astrocytes generated by the neural stem cells, recovery from spinal cord lesions was poorer than normal. Thus, somewhat counterintuitively, glial scarring appears to limit spinal cord damage and support the remaining cells."
https://openalex.org/W2006588622,"This work identifies a role for intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-intrinsic expression of histone deacetylase 3 in regulating commensal-bacteria-dependent gene expression and intestinal homeostasis; IEC-specific HDAC3 deficiency gives rise to Paneth cell abnormalities, impaired intestinal barrier function, and increased DSS-induced intestinal inflammation in commensal-bacteria-containing, but not germ-free, mice. Epigenetic mechanisms alter the transcriptional response to environmental cues and thus represent a mechanism that can link host genetic predisposition and environmental triggers in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This study identifies a previously unrecognized role for intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-intrinsic expression of the epigenome-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) in regulating intestinal barrier function and susceptibility to commensal-driven inflammation. IEC-specific HDAC3 deficiency in mice is shown to give rise to Paneth-cell abnormalities, rectal prolapse, increased susceptibility to dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis and increased barrier permeability in commensal-containing but not germ-free animals. The development and severity of inflammatory bowel diseases and other chronic inflammatory conditions can be influenced by host genetic and environmental factors, including signals derived from commensal bacteria1,2,3,4,5,6. However, the mechanisms that integrate these diverse cues remain undefined. Here we demonstrate that mice with an intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-specific deletion of the epigenome-modifying enzyme histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3ΔIEC mice) exhibited extensive dysregulation of IEC-intrinsic gene expression, including decreased basal expression of genes associated with antimicrobial defence. Critically, conventionally housed HDAC3ΔIEC mice demonstrated loss of Paneth cells, impaired IEC function and alterations in the composition of intestinal commensal bacteria. In addition, HDAC3ΔIEC mice showed significantly increased susceptibility to intestinal damage and inflammation, indicating that epithelial expression of HDAC3 has a central role in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Re-derivation of HDAC3ΔIEC mice into germ-free conditions revealed that dysregulated IEC gene expression, Paneth cell homeostasis and intestinal barrier function were largely restored in the absence of commensal bacteria. Although the specific mechanisms through which IEC-intrinsic HDAC3 expression regulates these complex phenotypes remain to be determined, these data indicate that HDAC3 is a critical factor that integrates commensal-bacteria-derived signals to calibrate epithelial cell responses required to establish normal host–commensal relationships and maintain intestinal homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1982804748,"The performance of optimized graphene devices is ultimately determined by the quality of the graphene itself. Graphene grown on copper foils is often wrinkled, and the orientation of the graphene cannot be controlled. Graphene grown on SiC(0001) via the decomposition of the surface has a single orientation, but its thickness cannot be easily limited to one layer. We describe a method in which a graphene film of one or two monolayers grown on SiC is exfoliated via the stress induced with a Ni film and transferred to another substrate. The excess graphene is selectively removed with a second exfoliation process with a Au film, resulting in a monolayer graphene film that is continuous and single-oriented."
https://openalex.org/W1970395554,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) and classical swine fever virus (CSFV) messenger RNAs contain related (HCV-like) internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) that promote 5'-end independent initiation of translation, requiring only a subset of the eukaryotic initiation factors (eIFs) needed for canonical initiation on cellular mRNAs. Initiation on HCV-like IRESs relies on their specific interaction with the 40S subunit, which places the initiation codon into the P site, where it directly base-pairs with eIF2-bound initiator methionyl transfer RNA to form a 48S initiation complex. However, all HCV-like IRESs also specifically interact with eIF3 (refs 2, 5-7, 9-12), but the role of this interaction in IRES-mediated initiation has remained unknown. During canonical initiation, eIF3 binds to the 40S subunit as a component of the 43S pre-initiation complex, and comparison of the ribosomal positions of eIF3 and the HCV IRES revealed that they overlap, so that their rearrangement would be required for formation of ribosomal complexes containing both components. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction of a 40S ribosomal complex containing eIF3 and the CSFV IRES. Remarkably, although the position and interactions of the CSFV IRES with the 40S subunit in this complex are similar to those of the HCV IRES in the 40S-IRES binary complex, eIF3 is completely displaced from its ribosomal position in the 43S complex, and instead interacts through its ribosome-binding surface exclusively with the apical region of domain III of the IRES. Our results suggest a role for the specific interaction of HCV-like IRESs with eIF3 in preventing ribosomal association of eIF3, which could serve two purposes: relieving the competition between the IRES and eIF3 for a common binding site on the 40S subunit, and reducing formation of 43S complexes, thereby favouring translation of viral mRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2024105361,"Autophagy can be activated via MTORC1 down-regulation by amino acid deprivation and by certain chemicals such as rapamycin, torin, and niclosamide. Lysosome is the degrading machine for autophagy but has also been linked to MTORC1 activation through the Rag/RRAG GTPase pathway. This association raises the question of whether lysosome can be involved in the initiation of autophagy. Toward this end, we found that niclosamide, an MTORC1 inhibitor, was able to inhibit lysosome degradation and increase lysosomal permeability. Niclosamide was ineffective in inhibiting MTORC1 in cells expressing constitutively activated Rag proteins, suggesting that its inhibitory effects were targeted to the Rag-MTORC1 signaling system. This places niclosamide in the same category of bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin A, inhibitors of the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase, for its dependence on Rag GTPase in suppression of MTORC1. Surprisingly, classical lysosome inhibitors such as chloroquine, E64D, and pepstatin A were also able to inhibit MTORC1 in a Rag-dependent manner. These lysosome inhibitors were able to activate early autophagy events represented by ATG16L1 and ATG12 puncta formation. Our work established a link between the functional status of the lysosome in general to the Rag-MTORC1 signaling axis and autophagy activation. Thus, the lysosome is not only required for autophagic degradation but also affects autophagy activation. Lysosome inhibitors can have a dual effect in suppressing autophagy degradation and in initiating autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2073818303,"A more complete understanding of how fear extinction alters neuronal activity and connectivity within fear circuits may aid in the development of strategies to treat human fear disorders. Using a c-fos-based transgenic mouse, we found that contextual fear extinction silenced basal amygdala (BA) excitatory neurons that had been previously activated during fear conditioning. We hypothesized that the silencing of BA fear neurons was caused by an action of extinction on BA inhibitory synapses. In support of this hypothesis, we found extinction-induced target-specific remodeling of BA perisomatic inhibitory synapses originating from parvalbumin and cholecystokinin-positive interneurons. Interestingly, the predicted changes in the balance of perisomatic inhibition matched the silent and active states of the target BA fear neurons. These observations suggest that target-specific changes in perisomatic inhibitory synapses represent a mechanism through which experience can sculpt the activation patterns within a neural circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2048165620,"Treatment of cells with brefeldin A (BFA) blocks secretory vesicle transport and causes a collapse of the Golgi apparatus. To gain more insight into the cellular mechanisms mediating BFA toxicity, we conducted a genome-wide haploid genetic screen that led to the identification of the small G protein ADP-ribosylation factor 4 (ARF4). ARF4 depletion preserves viability, Golgi integrity and cargo trafficking in the presence of BFA, and these effects depend on the guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 and other ARF isoforms including ARF1 and ARF5. ARF4 knockdown cells show increased resistance to several human pathogens including Chlamydia trachomatis and Shigella flexneri. Furthermore, ARF4 expression is induced when cells are exposed to several Golgi-disturbing agents and requires the CREB3 (also known as Luman or LZIP) transcription factor, whose downregulation mimics ARF4 loss. Thus, we have uncovered a CREB3-ARF4 signalling cascade that may be part of a Golgi stress response set in motion by stimuli compromising Golgi capacity."

Here, we show that the transmembrane protein semaphorin 6A and its receptor plexin A2 are critical for achieving radially symmetric arborization of On starburst amacrine cell (SAC) dendrites and normal SAC stratification in the mouse retina. Plexin A2 is expressed in both On and Off SACs; however, semaphorin 6A is expressed in On SACs. Specific On-Off bistratified direction-selective ganglion cells in semaphorin 6A(-/-) mutants exhibit decreased tuning of On directional motion responses. These results correlate the elaboration of symmetric SAC dendritic morphology and asymmetric responses to motion, shedding light on the development of visual pathways that use the same cell types for divergent outputs."

https://openalex.org/W1990165776,"DNA replication initiates at defined sites called origins, which serve as binding sites for initiator proteins that recruit the replicative machinery. Origins differ in number and structure across the three domains of life and their properties determine the dynamics of chromosome replication. Bacteria and some archaea replicate from single origins, whereas most archaea and all eukaryotes replicate using multiple origins. Initiation mechanisms that rely on homologous recombination operate in some viruses. Here we show that such mechanisms also operate in archaea. We use deep sequencing to study replication in Haloferax volcanii and identify four chromosomal origins of differing activity. Deletion of individual origins results in perturbed replication dynamics and reduced growth. However, a strain lacking all origins has no apparent defects and grows significantly faster than wild type. Origin-less cells initiate replication at dispersed sites rather than at discrete origins and have an absolute requirement for the recombinase RadA, unlike strains lacking individual origins. Our results demonstrate that homologous recombination alone can efficiently initiate the replication of an entire cellular genome. This raises the question of what purpose replication origins serve and why they have evolved."
https://openalex.org/W2006086532,"Resveratrol (RSV) has been shown to be involved in the regulation of energetic metabolism, generating increasing interest in therapeutic use. SIRT1 has been described as the main target of RSV. However, recent reports have challenged the hypothesis of its direct activation by RSV, and the signaling pathways remain elusive. Here, the effects of RSV on mitochondrial metabolism are detailed both in vivo and in vitro using murine and cellular models and isolated enzymes. We demonstrate that low RSV doses (1-5 μM) directly stimulate NADH dehydrogenases and, more specifically, mitochondrial complex I activity (EC50 ∼1 μM). In HepG2 cells, this complex I activation increases the mitochondrial NAD(+)/NADH ratio. This higher NAD(+) level initiates a SIRT3-dependent increase in the mitochondrial substrate supply pathways (i.e. the tricarboxylic acid cycle and fatty acid oxidation). This effect is also seen in liver mitochondria of RSV-fed animals (50 mg/kg/day). We conclude that the increase in NADH oxidation by complex I is a crucial event for SIRT3 activation by RSV. Our results open up new perspectives in the understanding of the RSV signaling pathway and highlight the critical importance of RSV doses used for future clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W1997167669,"Drug-evoked synaptic plasticity in the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system reorganizes neural circuits that may lead to addictive behavior. The first cocaine exposure potentiates AMPAR excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) onto DA neurons of the VTA but reduces the amplitude of NMDAR-EPSCs. While plasticity of AMPAR transmission is expressed by insertion of calcium (Ca2+)-permeable GluA2-lacking receptors, little is known about the expression mechanism for altered NMDAR transmission. Combining ex vivo patch-clamp recordings, mouse genetics, and subcellular Ca2+ imaging, we observe that cocaine drives the insertion of NMDARs that are quasi-Ca2+-impermeable and contain GluN3A and GluN2B subunits. These GluN3A-containing NMDARs appear necessary for the expression of cocaine-evoked plasticity of AMPARs. We identify an mGluR1-dependent mechanism to remove these noncanonical NMDARs that requires Homer/Shank interaction and protein synthesis. Our data provide insight into the early cocaine-driven reorganization of glutamatergic transmission onto DA neurons and offer GluN3A-containing NMDARs as new targets in drug addiction."

https://openalex.org/W2038516994,"Recent studies have documented the ability of prothrombin to spontaneously convert to the mature protease thrombin when Arg-320 becomes exposed to solvent for proteolytic attack upon mutation of residues in the activation domain. Whether prothrombin autoactivation occurs in the wild-type under conditions relevant to physiology remains unknown. Here, we report that binding of histone H4 to prothrombin under physiological conditions generates thrombin by autoactivation. The effect is abrogated by mutation of the catalytic Ser-525 and requires the presence of the Gla domain. Fluorescence titrations document direct binding of histone H4 to prothrombin with an affinity in the low nm range. Stopped flow data and luminescence resonance energy transfer measurements indicate that the binding mechanism obeys conformational selection. Among the two conformations of prothrombin, collapsed and fully extended, histone H4 binds selectively to the collapsed form and induces a transition toward a new conformation where the distance between Ser-101 in kringle-1 and Ser-210 in kringle-2 increases by 13 Å. These findings confirm the molecular plasticity of prothrombin emerged from recent structural studies and suggest that different conformations of the inter-kringle linker domain determine the functional behavior of prothrombin. The results also broaden our mechanistic understanding of the prothrombotic phenotype observed during cellular damage due to the release of histones in the blood stream. Prothrombin autoactivation induced by histone H4 emerges as a mechanism of pathophysiological relevance through which thrombin is generated independently of activation of the coagulation cascade."

https://openalex.org/W2004998163,"As part of the innate immune system, Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) recognizes bacterial cell surface lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by forming a complex with a lipid-binding co-receptor, MD-2. In the presence of agonist, TLR4·MD-2 dimerizes to form an active receptor complex, leading to initiation of intracellular inflammatory signals. TLR4 is of great biomedical interest, but its pharmacological manipulation is complicated because even subtle variations in the structure of LPS can profoundly impact the resultant immunological response. Here, we use atomically detailed molecular simulations to gain insights into the nature of the molecular signaling mechanism. We first demonstrate that MD-2 is extraordinarily flexible. The ""clamshell-like"" motions of its β-cup fold enable it to sensitively match the volume of its hydrophobic cavity to the size and shape of the bound lipid moiety. We show that MD-2 allosterically transmits this conformational plasticity, in a ligand-dependent manner, to a phenylalanine residue (Phe-126) at the cavity mouth previously implicated in TLR4 activation. Remarkably, within the receptor complex, we observe spontaneous transitions between active and inactive signaling states of Phe-126, and we confirm that Phe-126 is indeed the ""molecular switch"" in endotoxic signaling."

We used a TaqMan quantitative RT-PCR-based low density array to determine the GPCR expression profiles of ex vivo isolated intestinal mouse lymphatic (LECs) and blood vascular endothelial cells (BECs). GPR97, an orphan adhesion GPCR of unknown function, was the most highly and specifically expressed GPCR in mouse lymphatic endothelium. Using siRNA silencing, we found that GPR97-deficient primary human LECs displayed increased adhesion and collective cell migration, whereas single cell migration was decreased as compared with nontargeting siRNA-transfected control LECs. Loss of GPR97 shifted the ratio of active Cdc42 and RhoA and initiated cytoskeletal rearrangements, including F-actin redistribution, paxillin and PAK4 phosphorylation, and β1-integrin activation. Our data suggest a possible role of GPR97 in lymphatic remodeling and furthermore provide the first insights into the biological functions of GPR97."

In addition to contributing to the structural properties of the phospholipid bilayer, cholesterol is necessary to maintain plasma membrane (PM) 3The abbreviations used are: PMplasma membranesnoRNAsmall nucleolar RNAsnoRNPsmall nucleolar ribonucleoproteinERendoplasmic reticulumSREBPsterol regulatory element-binding proteinCEcholesteryl ester(s)ACATacyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferaseLPDSlipoprotein-deficient serumPCphosphatidylcholineLPClysophosphatidylcholineDMSOdimethyl sulfoxideRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsqPCRquantitative PCRASEantisense element. lipid raft structures that house a multitude of integral and membrane-associated proteins and complexes that are critical for cellular function. Cellular cholesterol originates from two sources: low density lipoprotein (LDL)-associated cholesterol and de novo synthesis, although uptake of cholesterol through the LDL-receptor pathway is the most quantitatively important of these in mammalian cells under physiological conditions. plasma membrane small nucleolar RNA small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein endoplasmic reticulum sterol regulatory element-binding protein cholesteryl ester(s) acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase lipoprotein-deficient serum phosphatidylcholine lysophosphatidylcholine dimethyl sulfoxide rapid amplification of cDNA ends quantitative PCR antisense element. The itinerary of LDL-derived cholesterol is well established. Following internalization via the LDL receptor, LDL particles are trafficked to a late endocytic compartment where esters are hydrolyzed by acid lipase to free cholesterol and subsequently released from endolysosomes via the concerted actions of the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)/Niemann-Pick C2 (NPC2) proteins. Most of this cholesterol is then transported to the PM with a minor amount transported directly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi, and mitochondria (1Kennedy B.E. Charman M. Karten B.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 16513-16518Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the PM is estimated to contain 60–90% of total cellular cholesterol, whereas the ER contains as little as 0.1–2% (4Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T.L. Regulation of endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol by plasma membrane cholesterol.J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2264-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This steep gradient is maintained despite a brisk flow of cholesterol between these compartments (5Chang T.Y. Chang C.C. Ohgami N. Yamauchi Y. Cholesterol sensing, trafficking, and esterification.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2006; 22: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that this pathway provides for “sampling” of cellular cholesterol levels in the ER, where the sterol-sensing SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) senses ER cholesterol levels that govern maturation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, master regulators of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis and uptake. A number of stimuli influence PM to ER retrograde cholesterol transport, including alteration of PM phospholipid content, insertion of membrane-disordering oxysterols, disruption of lipid rafts, and increasing bulk PM cholesterol content (6Lange Y.

Although the mechanism by which cholesterol is transported between the PM and ER membranes is not yet established, it is thought to be nonvesicular in nature (9Baumann N.A. Sullivan D.P. Ohvo-Rekilä H. Simonot C. Pottekat A. Klaassen Z. Beh C.T. Menon A.K. Transport of newly synthesized sterol to the sterol-enriched plasma membrane occurs via nonvesicular equilibration.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5816-5826Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Consistent with a protein-mediated mechanism, knockdown of ORP1/2, members of the oxysterol binding protein family known to participate in intermembrane trafficking of sterols, reduced PM to ER cholesterol trafficking in HeLa cells (10Jansen M. Ohsaki Y. Rita Rega L. Bittman R. Olkkonen V.M. Ikonen E. Role of ORPs in sterol transport from plasma membrane to ER and lipid droplets in mammalian cells.Traffic. 2011; 12: 218-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Likewise, the STARD4 protein has been implicated in intermembrane transfer of cholesterol between the endocytic recycling compartment and ER (11Mesmin B. Pipalia N.H. Lund F.W. Ramlall T.F. Sokolov A. Eliezer D. Maxfield F.R. STARD4 abundance regulates sterol transport and sensing.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 4004-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cholesterol transfer has been shown to occur between closely apposed PM and ER membrane contact sites (12Schulz T.A. Choi M.G. Raychaudhuri S. Mears J.A. Ghirlando R. Hinshaw J.E. Prinz W.A. Lipid-regulated sterol transfer between closely apposed membranes by oxysterol-binding protein homologues.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 889-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Although both types of mechanisms may contribute to total retrograde cholesterol transport, their respective contributions under physiologic conditions is uncertain. In a previous genetic screen, cells selected for resistance to amphotericin B, a cholesterol-dependent pore-forming toxin, isolated mutants from two complementation groups: those harboring defects in transport of cholesterol from the lysosome to the PM and those with defective PM to ER trafficking (13Dahl N.K.

Together with molecular simulations and model membrane studies that suggest the availability of cholesterol to trafficking mechanisms may first be determined by its local membrane lipid environment (6Lange Y.

To further delineate the genes involved in the internalization of PM cholesterol, we performed a loss-of-function screen in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells mutagenized with the ROSAβGEO promoter trap virus to isolate mutants resistant to the amphotericin B cholesterol binding toxin (19Borradaile N.M. Han X. Harp J.D. Gale S.E. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Disruption of endoplasmic reticulum structure and integrity in lipotoxic cell death.J.

Promoter traps in embryonic stem cells: a genetic screen to identify and mutate developmental genes in mice.Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Herein, we describe a CHO cell mutant in which a genetic disruption of the U60 small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) host gene impairs PM to ER retrograde cholesterol transport. For expression of the genomic mouse U60snhg locus, the genomic sequence, including 2 kb of upstream promoter sequence and 1 kb of downstream sequence, was cloned into the pSilencer 4.1-CMV Hygro vector, with CMV and other vector expression sequences removed. A QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to create mutD and mutASE snoRNA mutant constructs. FLAG epitope-labeled Nop56 (FLAG-Nop56) and FLAG-fibrillarin genes were cloned into the pSilencer 4.1-CMV Hygro vector, with expression driven by the CMV promoter. Chinese hamster ovary-K1 (CHO-K1) cells (CRL-9618) were obtained from ATCC. CHO-K1 Cells were maintained in monolayer culture at 37 °C with 5% CO2. All CHO-derived cell lines were maintained in normal medium consisting of 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin. NIH 3T3 cells (ATCC CRL 1658) were grown in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) calf serum (Sigma) and 50 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin. A stable pool of ROSAβGEO-transduced CHO cell mutants was generated as described previously (19Borradaile N.M. Han X. Harp J.D. Gale S.E. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Disruption of endoplasmic reticulum structure and integrity in lipotoxic cell death.J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 2726-2737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). This pool of mutants was grown for 24 h in cholesterol starvation medium consisting of 1:1 DMEM:Ham's F-12 with 1% (v/v) lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS), 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 20 μm lovastatin, and 50 μm mevalonate. Final concentration of DMSO during selection was <1%. Cells were re-fed with 9 μg/ml LDL in 5% LPDS for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 175 μg/ml amphotericin B in DMSO for 6 h and then replaced with normal medium. After recovery, the starvation, LDL treatment, and amphotericin selection were repeated. The surviving mutant CHO cell population was plated at a limiting dilution to select stable amphotericin B-resistant clones. [3H]Cholesterol (1 mCi/ml) was obtained from PerkinElmer (NET 139). [3H]Cholesteryl ester formation was assessed as described previously (2Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. Evidence for a cholesterol transport pathway from lysosomes to endoplasmic reticulum that is independent of the plasma membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells were split from confluency by one-third and grown for 24 h. These cells were then seeded at 2.5 × 104 per well in a 6-well dish for 24 h. Medium was changed to 5% LPDS for 24 h. Cells were then pulsed for a given time with 1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol in 1 ml of 5% LPDS media and were treated with either 1 μm 25-hydroxycholesterol in ethanol (final ethanol concentration, 0.01%) or 50 μm 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin-cholesterol where indicated. Cyclodextrin:cholesterol complexes were prepared as described in Lange et al. (21Lange Y. Ory D.S. Ye J. Lanier M.H. Hsu F.F. Steck T.L. Effectors of rapid homeostatic responses of endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1445-1455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with cold Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 10 min at 4 °C. Lipids were extracted from each well in 3 ml of 3:2 hexane:isopropyl alcohol and dried under nitrogen. [14C]Cholesteryl oleate was added to lipid extracts as a recovery standard. Cholesteryl esters (CE) were separated from cholesterol by thin layer chromatography (TLC) in a 130:30:2 heptane/ethyl ether/acetic acid solvent using 100 μg of cholesterol and 30 μg of CE as carriers, respectively, and visualized by iodine. The percentage of recovery of [3H]CE was assessed by recovery of [14C]cholesteryl oleate. [3H]Cholesterol esterification was measured as a ratio of recovery-normalized [3H]CE to total [3H]cholesterol. Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity was carried out as described previously (4Lange Y. Ye J. Rigney M. Steck T.L. Regulation of endoplasmic reticulum cholesterol by plasma membrane cholesterol.J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 2264-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 5 × 105 in 10-cm plates overnight. Medium was changed to 5% LPDS for 24 h. Isolated microsomes were resuspended in 60 μl of 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 7.4)/1 mm DTT and supplemented with 1 mg of fatty acid-free BSA in 0.1 m K-phosphate/DTT buffer. For the ACAT activity assay, 100 μl of cholesterol/Triton WR-1339 solution (20 μg of cholesterol, 60 μg of Triton-WR) was added to provide excess cholesterol. 20 μl of 250 μm [14C]oleoyl-CoA in 0.01 m K-phosphate was added to label CE formed by ACAT. ACAT inhibitor, CI-976 (gift from Warner-Lambert), dissolved in ethanol, was added to a 2 μm final concentration where described. Esterification was carried out at 37 °C for 15 min for ACAT activity and quenched with 4 ml of 2:1 chloroform/methanol. 800 μl of PBS was added to extract lipids, and organic phase was removed and dried down under nitrogen. CE were separated by TLC in the same manner as described above and counted by scintillation. Deep etch electron microscopy to assess plasma membrane-ER contact sites was performed in the Heuser laboratory (Washington University) as described (22Hanson P.I. Roth R. Lin Y. Heuser J.E. Plasma membrane deformation by circular arrays of ESCRT-III protein filaments.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Cells were grown on coverslips and unroofed using a brief ultrasound pulse in an intracellular buffer (30 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 70 mm KCL, 5 mm MgCl2, and 3 mm EGTA). Samples were immediately fixed in buffer containing 4% paraformaldehyde or 2% glutaraldehyde. Coverslips were frozen, replicated, and imaged as described (22Hanson P.I. Roth R. Lin Y. Heuser J.E. Plasma membrane deformation by circular arrays of ESCRT-III protein filaments.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 180: 389-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Isolation of PM was carried out using the plasma membrane protein extraction kit per the manufacturer's protocol (Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 per 10-cm plate and grown for 24 h in normal medium and then changed to medium containing 5% LPDS for 24 h. 50 plates were used for each fractionation. Cells were homogenized with 75 stokes in a Dounce homogenizer, and the postnuclear supernatant was spun at 10,000 × g to obtain total cellular membrane proteins. Membranes were then resuspended in the upper phase solution and extracted using the lower phase solution followed by centrifugation to pellet the PM. ER membranes were isolated as described previously (23Sokolov A. Radhakrishnan A. Accessibility of cholesterol in endoplasmic reticulum membranes and activation of SREBP-2 switch abruptly at a common cholesterol threshold.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 29480-29490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Equal protein amounts of each fraction were run by SDS-PAGE and assessed for purity by Western blotting with Na/K+ ATPase (sodium pump), protein disulfide isomerase, and prohibitin organelle markers for the PM, ER, and mitochondria, respectively. To membrane fractions, internal standards (either deuterated or incorporating odd chain fatty acyl species) were added, and lipid extraction was performed by the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. A rapid method of total lipid extraction and purification.Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for lipid species quantification (25Fan M. Sidhu R. Fujiwara H. Tortelli B. Zhang J. Davidson C. Walkley S.U. Bagel J.H. Vite C. Yanjanin N.M. Porter F.D. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. Identification of Niemann-Pick C1 disease biomarkers through sphingolipid profiling.J. Lipid Res. 2013; 54: 2800-2814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The exon sequence fused upstream of the ROSAβGEO cassette was identified by 5′ RACE (SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit, Clontech) of total RNA extracted from the CHO A1 cell line, utilizing the known sequences of a 5′-ligated oligonucleotide and the ROSAβGEO transcript (see supplemental Table 1). The resulting sequenced 5′ RACE product was then used to conduct 3′ RACE using wild type (WT) CHO RNA to identify the remaining 3′ exons in the disrupted locus. PCR was carried out using WT CHO or A1 genomic DNA as a template, with a forward primer specific to the 5′ end of the RACE product and a reverse primer either specific to the 3′ end of the RACE product to amplify the WT locus or specific to the middle of the ROSAβGEO provirus to amplify the disrupted locus. Genomic DNA from WT CHO and A1 cells were digested with XbaI, NotI, and BglII, run on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to GeneScreen nylon membrane. A 32P end-labeled probe antisense to the ROSAβGEO sequence was used to probe for ROSAβGEO proviral integration. The full-length U60snhg mouse locus was amplified from genomic DNA. It contains 2 kb of upstream promoter sequence and 1 kb of sequence downstream of U60snhg exon 2. The PCR product was amplified with primers containing NotI and Kpn1 sequences for cloning into the pSilencer 4.1 vector lacking CMV. To generate stable knockdown clones, an shRNA oligonucleotide (see supplemental Table 1) directed against the murine U60snoRNA was cloned into a pSilencer 4.1-CMV Hygro vector (Ambion). The shRNA vector was transfected into NIH 3T3 cells. Cells were plated at limiting dilution and selected with hygromycin, and clonal cell lines (KD1 and KD2) were isolated. TRIzol-extracted RNA was reverse-transcribed with the SuperScript III kit (Invitrogen). U60 snoRNA was reverse-transcribed with a stem-loop primer with oligo(dT) reversed transcribed poly(A) RNAs. cDNAs were detected and amplified using SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosciences) (see primer list in supplemental Table 1). U60 snoRNA was in vitro transcribed from a short DNA oligonucleotide containing a 5′ T7 sequence and the mouse SNORD60 gene (MEGAshortscript T7 kit, Invitrogen). The in vitro transcription reaction was run on an 8 m urea 10% polyacrylamide gel. RNA products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining and excised for overnight elution. Eluted U60 was precipitated and end-labeled with 3′-biotin (RNA 3′ end biotinylation kit, Pierce). The efficiency of labeling was determined by dot blot. 3T3 mouse fibroblasts were seeded and cultured overnight at 5 × 105 cells/10-cm plate. Cells were transfected with 5 pmol of Bio-U60 plus 8 μg of FLAG-protein DNA construct per plate using Lipofectamine Plus. Cells were lysed in TNEN (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1× Complete protease inhibitor cocktail, 1 mm PMSF) buffer plus Superasin 24 h after transfection, and postnuclear supernatant was used for FLAG immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG beads (anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel, Sigma) (26Lewis S.E. Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Membrane topology of the murine fatty acid transport protein 1.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37042-37050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from FLAG beads using TRIzol, and RNA was run on 4% native polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and blotted for presence of biotin (chemiluminescent nucleic acid detection module, Pierce). Detection of rRNA methylation was adapted from Belin et al. (27Belin S. Beghin A. Solano-Gonzàlez E. Bezin L. Brunet-Manquat S. Textoris J. Prats A.C. Mertani H.C. Dumontet C. Diaz J.J. Dysregulation of ribosome biogenesis and translational capacity is associated with tumor progression of human breast cancer cells.PLoS One. 2009; 4: e7147Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from yeast cells using the RiboPure-yeast kit (Ambion) or from CHO cell lines using TRIzol. 28 S and 18 S RNAs were separated from total RNA by agarose-gel electrophoresis, visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and isolated by gel extraction. One ng of rRNA was used for reverse transcription (RT) by SuperScript III in the presence of either 1 μm or 1 mm dNTPs using reverse primer directed downstream of the methylation site. qPCR was carried out using SYBR Green master mix to detect RT extended primers using the primer set flanking methylation site (supplemental Table 1). To generate a pool of mutagenized CHO cells, we performed insertional mutagenesis using the ROSAβGEO retrovirus (19Borradaile N.M. Han X. Harp J.D. Gale S.E. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E.

Promoter traps in embryonic stem cells: a genetic screen to identify and mutate developmental genes in mice.Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Transduction was optimized to achieve an average of one insertion per 20 genomes. The integrated provirus contains a β-galactosidase gene, a neomycin resistance gene, and a poly(A) signal with no upstream promoter sequence, thus only conferring antibiotic resistance and genetic disruption if integrated downstream of an active promoter and splice donor. G418 selection of transduced cells was used to generate a pool of stably mutagenized CHO cells. This pool of cells was subjected to amphotericin B/LDL selection twice, after which individual cell lines were isolated (Fig. 1A). At the amphotericin B and LDL concentrations used in the screen, nonmutagenized WT cells failed to survive the two rounds of selection, thus minimizing background. To select amphotericin B-resistant mutants that did not simply harbor defects in the egress of endolysosomal cholesterol (e.g. NPC1 mutants), only clones that displayed normal filipin staining patterns (28Millard E.E. Srivastava K. Traub L.M. Schaffer J.E. Ory D.S. Niemann-pick type C1 (NPC1) overexpression alters cellular cholesterol homeostasis.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38445-38451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were selected for further analysis. To screen CHO mutants for altered rates of cholesterol transfer from the PM to internal membranes, we measured the availability of PM cholesterol for trafficking to the ER by determining the rate of esterification of cell surface cholesterol by ACAT. For these experiments, cells were grown in lipoprotein-deficient medium, pulsed with ethanolic [3H]cholesterol, which readily incorporates into the PM, and subsequently assayed for detection of [3H]CE. One of the cell lines, A1, consistently displayed a 50–60% decrease in basal [3H]CE formation over a 24-h time course when compared with WT cells (Fig. 1B). This was not"
https://openalex.org/W2062299478,"Paramyxovirus fusion (F) proteins promote membrane fusion between the viral envelope and host cell membranes, a critical early step in viral infection. Although mutational analyses have indicated that transmembrane (TM) domain residues can affect folding or function of viral fusion proteins, direct analysis of TM-TM interactions has proved challenging. To directly assess TM interactions, the oligomeric state of purified chimeric proteins containing the Staphylococcal nuclease (SN) protein linked to the TM segments from three paramyxovirus F proteins was analyzed by sedimentation equilibrium analysis in detergent and buffer conditions that allowed density matching. A monomer-trimer equilibrium best fit was found for all three SN-TM constructs tested, and similar fits were obtained with peptides corresponding to just the TM region of two different paramyxovirus F proteins. These findings demonstrate for the first time that class I viral fusion protein TM domains can self-associate as trimeric complexes in the absence of the rest of the protein. Glycine residues have been implicated in TM helix interactions, so the effect of mutations at Hendra F Gly-508 was assessed in the context of the whole F protein. Mutations G508I or G508L resulted in decreased cell surface expression of the fusogenic form, consistent with decreased stability of the prefusion form of the protein. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis of TM domains containing these mutations gave higher relative association constants, suggesting altered TM-TM interactions. Overall, these results suggest that trimeric TM interactions are important driving forces for protein folding, stability and membrane fusion promotion."
https://openalex.org/W2035754161,"Cancer/testis antigen cancer-associated gene (CAGE) is known to be involved in various cellular processes, such as proliferation, cell motility, and anti-cancer drug resistance. However, the mechanism of the expression regulation of CAGE remains unknown. Target scan analysis predicted the binding of microRNA-200b (miR-200b) to CAGE promoter sequences. The expression of CAGE showed an inverse relationship with miR-200b in various cancer cell lines. miR-200b was shown to bind to the 3'-UTR of CAGE and to regulate the expression of CAGE at the transcriptional level. miR-200b also enhanced the sensitivities to microtubule-targeting drugs in vitro. miR-200b and CAGE showed opposite regulations on invasion potential and responses to microtubule-targeting drugs. Xenograft experiments showed that miR-200b had negative effects on the tumorigenic and metastatic potential of cancer cells. The effect of miR-200b on metastatic potential involved the expression regulation of CAGE by miR-200b. miR-200b decreased the tumorigenic potential of a cancer cell line resistant to microtubule-targeting drugs in a manner associated with the down-regulation of CAGE. ChIP assays showed the direct regulation of miR-200b by CAGE. CAGE enhanced the invasion potential of a cancer cell line stably expressing miR-200b. miR-200b exerted a negative regulation on tumor-induced angiogenesis. The down-regulation of CAGE led to the decreased expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, a TGFβ-responsive protein involved in angiogenesis, and VEGF. CAGE mediated tumor-induced angiogenesis and was necessary for VEGF-promoted angiogenesis. Human recombinant CAGE protein displayed angiogenic potential. Thus, miR-200b and CAGE form a feedback regulatory loop and regulate the response to microtubule-targeting drugs, as well as the invasion, tumorigenic potential, and angiogenic potential."

In this study, we show that deficiency of either autophagy or sequestosome 1 (p62 or SQSTM) led to inflammasome hyperactivation in response to LPS and ATP in primary macrophages and in mice in vivo. Importantly, induction of protein misfolding by puromycin, thapsigargin, or geldanamycin resulted in inflammasome activation that was more pronounced in autophagy- or p62-deficient macrophages. Accumulation of misfolded proteins caused inflammasome activation by inducing generation of nonmitochondrial reactive oxygen species and lysosomal damage, leading to release of cathepsin B. Our results suggest that altered proteostasis results in inflammasome activation and thus provide mechanisms for the association of altered proteostasis with inflammatory disorders.

Our results suggest that altered proteostasis results in inflammasome activation and thus provide mechanisms for the association of altered proteostasis with inflammatory disorders. The inflammatory response must be actively controlled to prevent “bystander” damage to tissues. Yet the mechanisms controlling excessive inflammatory responses are poorly understood (1Medzhitov R. Origin and physiological roles of inflammation.Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3887) Google Scholar). Acute inflammation resulting in septic shock, acute lung injury, and multiorgan dysfunction is a common cause of death in critically ill patients (2Cohen J. The immunopathogenesis of sepsis.Nature. 2002; 420: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chronic inflammation is a major underlying pathology in many systemic disorders, including lung diseases, metabolic disorders, and cancer (1Medzhitov R. Origin and physiological roles of inflammation.Nature. 2008; 454: 428-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (3887) Google Scholar). Macrophages are critical for pathogen recognition, initiation, and amplification of the inflammatory cascade mainly through regulation of key inflammatory mediators, such as TNF-α and IL-1β (3Dostert C. Pétrilli V. Van Bruggen R. Steele C. Mossman B.T. Tschopp J. Innate immune activation through Nalp3 inflammasome sensing of asbestos and silica.Science. 2008; 320: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). The strong pro-inflammatory activity of IL-1β, its processing, and secretion are tightly regulated by the inflammasome (4Schroder K. Tschopp J. The inflammasomes.Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). The inflammasomes are molecular platforms activated upon cellular infection or stress, which trigger the activation of caspase 1 that carries out processing of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 (4Schroder K. Tschopp J. The inflammasomes.Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). Dysregulated inflammasome activation is associated with certain human heritable and acquired inflammatory diseases (4Schroder K. Tschopp J. The inflammasomes.Cell. 2010; 140: 821-832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4114) Google Scholar). Recent studies have identified multiple pathways for inflammasome activation (5Atianand M.K. Rathinam V.A. Fitzgerald K.A. SnapShot: Inflammasomes. Cell. 2013; 153: 272-272.e1Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, physiological mechanisms for suppression of inflammasome activity remain to be elucidated. There is emerging evidence that autophagy deficiency is associated with hyperactivation of the inflammasome (6Nakahira K. Haspel J.A. Rathinam V.A. Lee S.J. Dolinay T. Lam H.C. Englert J.A.

However, the mechanisms by which autophagy regulates inflammasome activity are not fully understood. Protein biogenesis is an error-prone process, and newly synthesized proteins are constantly subjected to misfolding. Cells have developed a network of pathways aimed at maintaining protein homeostasis (proteostasis) (9Mu T.W. Ong D.S. Wang Y.J. Balch W.E. Yates 3rd, J.R. Segatori L. Kelly J.W. Chemical and biological approaches synergize to ameliorate protein-folding diseases.Cell. 2008; 134: 769-781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). These include protein refolding systems, degradation pathways, and sequestration strategies. Because of the critical role of autophagy in maintaining proteostasis, it is conceivable that altered proteostasis in autophagy-deficient cells leads to hyperactivation of the inflammasome. In this study, we show that altered proteostasis triggers NALP3 inflammasome activation that is dependent on generation of ROS 2The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesERendoplasmic reticulumNACN-acetylcysteineZbenzyloxycarbonylBMDMbone marrow-derived macrophageAPDC(2R,4R)-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylic acid. and cathepsin B release.

All animal experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Bone marrow cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with mouse macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) or 10% conditioned media from L929 cell culture for 7 days to differentiate into macrophages. Primary human macrophages were differentiated from peripheral blood monocytes isolated from human blood via a double density technique using Ficoll Isopaque and 46% iso-osmotic Percoll centrifugation and were cultured with human M-CSF for 7 days.

Raw 264.7 cells were transduced with nontargeting control shRNA lentiviral transduction particles (SHC002V; Sigma) and Atg7 (SHCLNV, NM_019584; Sigma) or Beclin1 (SHCLNV, NM_028835; Sigma) mission shRNA lentiviral transduction particles, followed by selection using media containing puromycin (2 μg/ml). Primary BMDM were transfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and siRNAs smart pools against nontargeting (control) and mouse NALP3 (Dharmacon; M-053455-01-0005). To detect total or mitochondrial ROS, cells were incubated at 37 °C with CM-H2DCFDA (10 μm; Invitrogen) for 30 min or MitoSOX (5 μm; Invitrogen) for 15 min in PBS, respectively, washed three times with PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. To measure mitochondrial membrane potential, cells were incubated with MitoTracker Deep Red (200 nm; Invitrogen) in culture media for 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. For evaluation of lysosomal damage, cells were incubated with DQ-BSA (10 μg/ml; Invitrogen) for 30 or 60 min at 37 °C or incubated with Lysotracker Red (75 nm; Invitrogen) for 2 h at 37 °C, washed three times with PBS, and analyzed by flow cytometry. All flow cytometry experiments were performed using LSRFortessaTM Cell Analyzer (BD Biosciences). Cells were plated on type I collagen-coated glass coverslips in a 6-well plate. After treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4 °C, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, blocked with 10% normal goat serum, incubated first with Lamp1 antibody (Pharmingen, 553792) and then with goat anti-rat IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488, and mounted using the Prolong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M microscope. Atg7f/f and Atg7Δ mice (male, 8–10 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with PBS or 10 mg/kg of LPS from Escherichia coli serotype (0111:B4; Sigma). Two hours following injection, blood was collected from the inferior vena cava. p62+/+ and p62−/− mice (male, 8–10 weeks old) were injected intraperitoneally with 1 mg/kg of LPS, followed 2 h later by intraperitoneal injection of 100 μl of PBS or ATP (100 mm), and blood was collected from inferior vena cava 15 min after the second injection (n = 3–6 mice/group). Statistical significance was evaluated by Student's t test for two groups. All data are representative of at least three independent experiments. Recently, it has been reported that deficiency in autophagy proteins is linked to inflammasome activation (6Nakahira K. Haspel J.A. Rathinam V.A. Lee S.J. Dolinay T. Lam H.C. Englert J.A.

Ichijo H. Mori K. Tschopp J. ER stress activates the NLRP3 inflammasome via an UPR-independent pathway.Cell Death Dis. 2012; 3: e261Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed, but the underlying direct mechanisms are not well understood. We investigated the mechanisms of how deficiency of autophagy regulates inflammasome activation. Inflammasome activation was evaluated by measuring IL-1β production in culture media and by immunodetecting cleaved caspase 1 in cell lysates. In macrophage cell line Raw 264.7, LPS treatment was sufficient to induce robust inflammasome activation that could be inhibited by specific caspase 1 inhibitor Z-YVAD. In these cells, knockdown of autophagy-related gene 7 (Atg7) or Beclin1 or inhibition of autophagy with 3-methyladenine enhanced inflammasome activation in response to LPS (Fig. 1, A–C). In contrast, production of IL-6 or TNF-α was not affected by Beclin1 knockdown (data not shown). We extended our observations to primary macrophages and generated myeloid-specific Atg7-deficient mice (10Liu X.D. Ko S. Xu Y. Fattah E.A. Xiang Q. Jagannath C. Ishii T. Komatsu M. Eissa N.T. Transient aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins is a cytosolic unfolded protein response to inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19687-19698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We crossed mice bearing Atg7flox/flox alleles with LysM-Cre transgenic mice, which express Cre recombinase in a myeloid specific manner, including macrophages and neutrophils. We then compared Atg7flox/flox LysM-Cre-positive mice, henceforth referred to as Atg7Δ, to Atg7flox/flox littermates, i.e. Atg7f/f. To induce inflammasome activation, macrophages were treated with LPS or primed with LPS and then stimulated with ATP, a potent activator of NALP3 inflammasome (12Mariathasan S. Weiss D.S. Newton K. McBride J. O'Rourke K. Roose-Girma M. Lee W.P. Weinrauch Y. Monack D.M. Dixit V.M. Cryopyrin activates the inflammasome in response to toxins and ATP.Nature. 2006; 440: 228-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (2332) Google Scholar). We observed stronger caspase 1 activation and more IL-1β production in BMDM of Atg7Δ mice than in Atg7f/f (Fig. 1D). Importantly, deficiency of autophagy did not affect pro-IL-1β expression in BMDM or in Raw 264.7 cells (data not shown), supporting the conclusion that increased IL-1β production is not simply caused by transcriptional increase of pro-IL-1β but rather by increased inflammasome activity. Finally, Atg7Δ mice had increased serum levels of IL-1β after intraperitoneal injection of LPS (Fig. 1E). These results are consistent with recent reports that autophagy deficiency can induce hyperactivation of inflammasome in vitro and in vivo (6Nakahira K. Haspel J.A. Rathinam V.A. Lee S.J. Dolinay T. Lam H.C. Englert J.A. Rabinovitch M. Cernadas M. Kim H.P. Fitzgerald K.A. Ryter S.W. Choi A.M.

A role for mitochondria in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Nature. 2011; 469: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). Autophagy is a major pathway for degradation of intracellular contents such as damaged organelles, protein aggregates, and misfolded proteins (14Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5540) Google Scholar, 15Kraft C. Peter M. Hofmann K. Selective autophagy: ubiquitin-mediated recognition and beyond.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 836-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Thus, we hypothesized that altered proteostasis results in inflammasome activation that will be exaggerated in autophagy-deficient cells because of reduced capacity to handle misfolded proteins. To test this hypothesis, we investigated if induction of misfolded proteins in wild type cells could enhance inflammasome activation. We treated LPS-primed BMDM with various stimuli of protein misfolding-inducing agents, including puromycin, thapsigargin, or geldanamycin. Macrophages were primed with LPS to induce expression of pro-IL-1β. Cells were then incubated for 4 h with reagents that induce ER stress and/or misfolded proteins. Puromycin prematurely stops protein translation and thus leads to generation of truncated peptides (16Bjørkøy G. Lamark T. Brech A. Outzen H. Perander M. Overvatn A. Stenmark H. Johansen T. p62/SQSTM1 forms protein aggregates degraded by autophagy and has a protective effect on huntingtin-induced cell death.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2505) Google Scholar). ER stress was induced by treatment with thapsigargin, which inhibits ER calcium pump (17Hotamisligil G.S. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and the inflammatory basis of metabolic disease.Cell. 2010; 140: 900-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). Geldanamycin is an inhibitor of the chaperone HSP90 and thus reduces protein folding (18Tsai B. Ye Y. Rapoport T.A. Retro-translocation of proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). Induction of altered proteostasis, by all of the above agents, caused a significant increase in aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 2A), which is an early event in the cytosol in response to altered proteostasis (10Liu X.D. Ko S. Xu Y. Fattah E.A. Xiang Q. Jagannath C. Ishii T. Komatsu M. Eissa N.T. Transient aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins is a cytosolic unfolded protein response to inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19687-19698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and resulted in inflammasome activation in mouse BMDM (Fig. 2A) and in primary monocyte-derived human macrophages (Fig. 2B). In support of inflammasome-specific effect, production of IL-6 was not induced in response to protein misfolding-inducing agents (data not shown). siRNA knockdown of NALP3 markedly attenuated caspase 1 activation and IL-1β production in response to puromycin or the classic NALP3 activator ATP in LPS-primed BMDM (Fig. 2C). NALP3 inflammasome activation is dependent on K+ efflux (19Kanneganti T.D. Lamkanfi M. Kim Y.G. Chen G. Park J.H. Franchi L. Vandenabeele P. Núñez G. Pannexin-1-mediated recognition of bacterial molecules activates the cryopyrin inflammasome independent of Toll-like receptor signaling.Immunity. 2007; 26: 433-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 20Pétrilli V. Papin S. Dostert C. Mayor A. Martinon F. Tschopp J. Activation of the NALP3 inflammasome is triggered by low intracellular potassium concentration.Cell Death Differ. 2007; 14: 1583-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). High concentrations of K+ significantly abrogated puromycin- or ATP-induced IL-1β production (Fig. 2D). These results suggested that NALP3 has a critical role in inflammasome activation by altered proteostasis. We then investigated if inflammasome activation induced by altered proteostasis was exaggerated in autophagy-deficient cells because of their reduced capacity to handle misfolded proteins. Compared with wild type, LPS-primed BMDM from Atg7Δ mice exhibited increased IL-1β production in a dose-dependent response to puromycin (Fig. 3A). Consistent with inflammasome activation, puromycin-induced IL-1β production was significantly reduced by treatment of Z-YVAD, a caspase 1 inhibitor, in both Atg7f/f and Atg7Δ macrophages (Fig. 3B). Enhanced inflammasome activation in Atg7Δ macrophages was also observed when misfolded proteins were generated by geldanamycin treatment (Fig. 3C). Because these data suggested that altered proteostasis enhanced inflammasome activation in autophagy-deficient cells, we reasoned that the deficiency of another important proteostatic mechanism might also lead to inflammasome activation. p62 is an important adaptor protein in cellular proteostasis (21Seibenhener M.L. Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wong H.C. Krishna N.R. Wooten M.W. Sequestosome 1/p62 is a polyubiquitin chain binding protein involved in ubiquitin proteasome degradation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8055-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We found that, in p62−/− mice, BMDM had exaggerated response to inflammasome activators, including ATP and valinomycin (Fig. 4, A and B). We noticed a slight but significant increase in pro-IL-1β expression in the p62−/− BMDM in response to LPS (Fig. 4A, right panel). This increase, however, could not account for the marked increase of IL-1β noted in p62−/− BMDM, which is more likely due to increased inflammasome activity. Importantly, caspase 1 inhibitor Z-YVAD prevented IL-1β production caused by p62 deficiency, confirming that the increase in IL-1β in p62−/− BMDM was primarily caused by increased caspase 1 activation. Furthermore, following in vivo injection of LPS and ATP, p62−/− mice had higher levels of serum IL-1β compared with wild type mice (Fig. 4C). These results suggested that p62 deficiency, similar to autophagy deficiency, led to exaggerated inflammasome activation. We then tested the response of p62−/− macrophages to agents that induced misfolded proteins. Induction of inflammasome activation with puromycin was significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner, as evidenced by increased IL-1β production and caspase 1-cleaved product (Fig. 4, D and E). Similar results were obtained using thapsigargin or geldanamycin (Fig. 4, F and G). To confirm the specificity of inflammasome activation by these agents, IL-1β was significantly reduced by treatment of Z-YVAD, a caspase 1 inhibitor (Fig. 4, E–G). These results suggested that inflammasome was hyperactivated in p62-deficient macrophages in vitro and in vivo.FIGURE 4Inflammasome hyperactivation in p62-deficient macrophages. LPS-primed BMDM from p62+/+ or p62−/− mice were incubated with ATP (5 mm) for 30 min in the presence or absence of caspase 1 inhibitor Z-YVAD (20 μm) (A) or incubated for 2 h with valinomycin (10 μm) (B). p62+/+ or p62−/− mice were injected intraperitoneally with LPS (1 mg/kg) followed 2 h later by intraperitoneal injection of PBS or ATP (100 mm), and blood was collected after 15 min from the inferior vena cava. n = 3–6 mice/group (C). LPS-primed BMDM from p62+/+ or p62−/− mice were treated for 4 h with increasing concentrations of puromycin (D) or incubated for 4 h in the presence or absence of puromycin (15 μg/ml) and Z-YVAD (E), thapsigargin (5 μm) (F), or geldanamycin (10 μm) (G). IL-1β was measured in culture media or serum using ELISA, and cell lysates were analyzed by immunoblotting.

In LPS-primed BMDM, levels of ROS were increased after treatment with puromycin, thapsigargin, or geldanamycin, similar to that observed with ATP (Fig. 5A). Importantly, ROS levels were higher in LPS-primed p62−/− BMDM than in p62+/+ BMDM, following their incubation with puromycin or thapsigargin, but not with ATP (Fig. 5B). ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibited inflammasome activation by ATP, puromycin, or thapsigargin (Fig. 5, C and D). Similar results were obtained using other ROS scavengers, including glutathione monoethyl ester (Fig. 5C). These results suggested that increased ROS by protein misfolding-inducing agents contribute to inflammasome activation. Recent studies suggest a role for mitochondrial ROS in inflammasome activation in autophagy-deficient cells (6Nakahira K. Haspel J.A. Rathinam V.A. Lee S.J. Dolinay T. Lam H.C. Englert J.A. Rabinovitch M. Cernadas M. Kim H.P. Fitzgerald K.A. Ryter S.W. Choi A.M.

A role for mitochondria in NLRP3 inflammasome activation.Nature. 2011; 469: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (3447) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated a potential role for mitochondrial ROS in induced inflammasome activation by midfolded proteins. These studies were done in LPS-primed BMDM from p62−/− or Atg7Δ mice and their wild type controls in response to ATP or puromycin. Surprisingly, treatment of LPS-primed BMDM with ATP but not with puromycin increased the percentages with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, detected with MitoTracker Red staining (Fig. 6, A and B). In addition, treatment of LPS-primed BMDM with ATP, but not with puromycin or thapsigargin, resulted in an increase in mitochondrial ROS (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, mitochondrion-specific ROS scavenger mTempo suppressed ATP- but not puromycin-induced inflammasome activation (Fig. 6, D and E). These results suggested that inflammasome activation by altered proteostasis was not caused by mitochondrial damage; it was triggered by nonmitochondrial ROS.FIGURE 6Inflammasome activation by altered proteostasis is dependent on nonmitochondrial ROS. A and B, LPS-primed wild type, p62−/−, or Atg7Δ BMDM were treated for 4 h with puromycin (15 μg/ml) or for 15 min with ATP (5 mm) and analyzed by flow cytometry using MitoTracker Deep Red.

Lysosomes play a key role in degradation of misfolded proteins (10Liu X.D. Ko S. Xu Y. Fattah E.A. Xiang Q. Jagannath C. Ishii T. Komatsu M. Eissa N.T. Transient aggregation of ubiquitinated proteins is a cytosolic unfolded protein response to inflammation and endoplasmic reticulum stress.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 19687-19698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). To investigate if accumulation of misfolded protein induced lysosomal damage, we evaluated lysosomal morphology in response to those agents using immunofluorescence with lysosome-associated membrane glycoprotein 1 (LAMP1) antibody. Chloroquine is a lysosomotropic agent that accumulates within lysosomes and inhibits lysosomal acidification (24Steinman R.M. Mellman I.S. Muller W.A. Cohn Z.A. Endocytosis and the recycling of plasma membrane.J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used chloroquine as a positive control for lysosomal damage. We observed that LAMP1-positive compartments became enlarged after stimulation with puromycin, thapsigargin, geldanamycin or chloroquine in LPS-primed BMDM (Fig. 7A). We quantified levels of lysosome by flow cytometry analysis using LysoTracker-Red. In LPS-primed BMDM, the fluorescence of LysoTracker Red was increased in response to puromycin or thapsigargin (data not shown). We measured the degradative activity of lysosomes by flow cytometry using DQ-BSA, a fluorogenic substrate for proteases. In LPS-primed BMDM, we observed a significant decrease in lysosomal activity following treatment with puromycin, thapsigargin, or chloroquine (Fig. 7B). These results suggested that protein misfolding-inducing agents activate the inflammasome by triggering lysosomal destabilization. Chloroquine is a strong inducer of lysosomal damage (25Shintani T. Klionsky D.J. Autophagy in health and disease: a double-edged sword.Science. 2004; 306: 990-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar, 26Yoon Y.H. Cho K.S. Hwang J.J. Lee S.J. Choi J.A.

Keap1 facilitates p62-mediated ubiquitin aggregate clearance via autophagy.Autophagy. 2010; 6: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that chloroquine, similar to protein misfolding-inducing agents, may cause inflammasome activation. Indeed, we observed strong caspase 1 activation and IL-1β production in response to chloroquine in LPS-primed BMDM (Fig. 7C). Furthermore, puromycin- or thapsigargin-induced inflammasome activation was significantly enhanced by addition of chloroquine (Fig. 7D). Taken together, these results suggest that accumulation of misfolded proteins causes lysosomal destabilization and that impairment of lysosomal function contributes to inflammasome activation by altered proteostasis. Enlarged and destabilized lysosomes are more prone to rupture and to leak hydrolytic enzymes (28Ono K. Kim S.O. Han J. Susceptibility of lysosomes to rupture is a determinant for plasma membrane disruption in tumor necrosis factor α-induced cell death.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Release of lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B has been shown to trigger inflammasome activation (23Hornung V. Bauernfeind F. Halle A. Samstad E.O. Kono H. Rock K.L. Fitzgerald K.A. Latz E. Silica crystals and aluminum salts activate the NALP3 inflammasome through phagosomal destabilization.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (2159) Google Scholar). We found increased cathepsin B in culture supernatants of cells treated with chloroquine or protein misfolding-inducing agents (Figs. 7C and 8A). Consistent with altered proteostasis as the underlying mechanism, cathepsin B release by puromycin was significantly increased in Atg7Δ or p62−/− BMDM, compared with wild type (Fig. 8B). To confirm the role of cathepsin B in inflammasome activation by altered proteostasis, we used the cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074-Me. Inflammasome activation in response to protein misfolding-inducing agents was attenuated by concomitant inhibition of cathepsin B in wild type, Atg7Δ, or p62−/− BMDM (Fig. 8C and data not shown). However, the treatment did not abolish the difference between the control and the knock out, suggesting that cathepsin B release might not be the only mechanism involved. ROS may lead to destabilization of the lysosomal membrane permeabilization, thereby causing the release of cathepsins and other hydrolases (29Boya P. Kroemer G. Lysosomal membrane permeabilization in cell death.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 6434-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 30Johansson A.C. Appelqvist H. Nilsson C. Kågedal K. Roberg K. Ollinger K. Regulation of apoptosis-associated lysosomal membrane permeabilization.Apoptosis. 2010; 15: 527-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). We reasoned that increased ROS due to altered proteostasis might lead to enhanced lysosomal cathepsin B release. In support of this notion, cathepsin B release, caused by protein misfolding-inducing agents, was attenuated by ROS scavengers NAC and GSH (Fig. 8, D and E, and data not shown). Taken together, these results suggest that inflammasome activation by altered proteostasis is mediated by an increase in nonmitochondrial ROS, leading to lysosomal damage and cathepsin B release. Autophagy is a housekeeping mechanism that controls the cellular homeostasis by clearing damaged organelles and preventing accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins (14Levine B. Kroemer G. Autophagy in the pathogenesis of disease.Cell. 2008; 132: 27-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5540) Google Scholar). Altered proteostasis can occur due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins arising from disruption in the protein homeostatic machinery such as that of autophagy or ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Polyubiquitin-binding protein p62 is involved in autophagy and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Therefore, we reasoned that the p62-deficient model would be informative for studying the consequences of altered protein homeostatic machinery. In this study, we have shown that accumulation of misfolded proteins triggers inflammasome activation that is enhanced by deficiency of either autophagy or p62 (Fig. 9). Therefore, these findings link the roles of autophagy and p62 in proteostasis to inflammation and the innate immune response. Several studies have shown that NALP3 inflammasome activation is triggered by increased generation of ROS and suppressed by ROS scavengers. However, the role of ROS in inflammasome activation in general and the source of ROS implicated in such a role are more controversial (31Bauernfeind F. Bartok E. Rieger A. Franchi L. Núñez G. Hornung V. Cutting edge: reactive oxygen species inhibitors block priming, but not activation, of the NLRP3 inflammasome.J. Immunol. 2011; 187: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 32van de Veerdonk F.L. Smeekens S.P. Joosten L.A. Kullberg B.J. Dinarello C.A. van der Meer J.W. Netea M.G.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Altered proteostasis leads to increased ROS. This increase is because the unfolded protein response is associated with up-regulation of chaperones involved in disulfide bond formation in the ER (Ero1p and Erv2p). These enzymes use oxidation/reduction reactions, with molecular oxygen as the final electron recipient leading to increased ROS formation (17Hotamisligil G.S. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and the inflammatory basis of metabolic disease.Cell. 2010; 140: 900-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar, 33Malhotra J.D. Miao H. Zhang K. Wolfson A. Pennathur S. Pipe S.W. Kaufman R.J. Antioxidants reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress and improve protein secretion.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 18525-18530Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that altered proteostasis enhanced the production of ROS in LPS-primed BMDM. Mitochondrial ROS were increased in response to ATP but not to altered proteostasis. In addition, inflammasome activation, by altered proteostasis, was suppressed by ROS scavengers but not by mTEMPO, a scavenger specific for mitochondrial ROS. These results suggest that activation of inflammasome by altered proteostasis is mediated by ROS, but in contrast to ATP activation, the source of ROS is not from mitochondria. Another cellular source of ROS is an NADPH-oxidative system. It has been reported that particles such as silica, asbestos, and monosodium orate activate the inflammasome activation by ROS, which are generated by NADPH oxidase during their phagocytosis (3Dostert C. Pétrilli V. Van Bruggen R. Steele C. Mossman B.T. Tschopp J. Innate immune activation through Nalp3 inflammasome sensing of asbestos and silica.Science. 2008; 320: 674-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). We found that APDC, an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase, had no effect on caspase 1 activation or cathepsin B release induced by altered proteostasis. Taken together, these findings suggest that inflammasome activation by altered proteostasis is triggered by nonmitochondrial ROS. Lysosomes play an important role in protein homeostasis. Here, we have shown that altered proteostasis-induced inflammasome activation was significantly enhanced by inhibition of the lysosomal degradation pathway by chloroquine. Importantly, protein misfolding-inducing agents led to lysosomal destabilization and cathepsin B release. However, it is unclear whether or not accumulation of misfolded proteins induces the lysosomal destabilization directly or indirectly. One possible mechanism is that misfolded proteins, by overwhelming the capacity of the degradation within the lysosome, directly damage them. Another possibility is that increased ROS due to accumulation of misfolded proteins led to lysosomal damage. We found a strong correlation between caspase 1 activation and cathepsin B release in response to various stimuli, which induce altered proteostasis, including puromycin, thapsigargin, geldanamycin, or chloroquine. Importantly, inhibition of caspase 1 did not affect the cathepsin B release (Fig. 8E), suggesting that cathepsin B release is upstream event of caspase 1 activation. Furthermore, cathepsin B inhibition attenuated NALP3 inflammasome activation, suggesting a causal relationship. In summary, we have shown that altered proteostasis induced NALP3 inflammasome activation through mechanisms involving ROS generation and lysosome destabilization. Altered proteostasis enhanced inflammasome activation in autophagy or p62-deficient cells. Our study provides an important mechanistic explanation for association between altered proteostasis and inflammation. Atg7f/f and p62−/− mice were obtained from Drs. M. Komatsu and T. Ishii, respectively. We thank Joel M. Sederstrom for expert assistance."

In this study, we investigated the interaction between ZMIZ2 and β-catenin, a key regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. We demonstrated that the expression of exogenous ZMIZ2 augments TCF (T cell factor) and β-catenin-mediated transcription. In contrast, shRNA knockdown of ZMIZ2 expression specifically represses the enhancement of TCF/β-catenin-mediated transcription by ZMIZ2. Using Wnt3a-conditioned medium, we demonstrated that ZMIZ2 can enhance Wnt ligand-induced TCF/β-catenin-mediated transcription. We also showed a promotional role of ZMIZ2 in enhancing β-catenin downstream target gene expression in human cells and in Zmiz2 null (Zmiz2(-/-)) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). The regulatory role of Zmiz2 in Wnt-induced TCF/β-catenin-mediated transcription can be restored in Zmiz2(-/-) MEFs that were infected with adenoviral expression vectors for Zmiz2. Moreover, enhancement of Zmiz2 on TCF/β-catenin-mediated transcription was further demonstrated in Zmiz2 knockout and Axin2 reporter compound mice. Furthermore, the protein-protein interaction between ZMIZ2 and β-catenin was identified by co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro protein pulldown assays. We also observed recruitment of endogenous ZMIZ2 onto the promoter region of the Axin 2 gene, a β-catenin downstream target promoter, in a Wnt ligand-inducible manner. Finally, a promotional role of ZMIZ2 on cell growth was demonstrated in human cell lines and Zmiz2 knockout MEFs. Our findings demonstrate a novel interaction between ZMIZ2 and β-catenin and elucidate a novel mechanism for PIAS-like proteins in regulating Wnt signaling pathways."

Although other PCSK enzymes are known to be essential for biological processes ranging from cholesterol metabolism to host defense, the in vivo importance of the evolutionarily ancient PCSK7 has remained enigmatic. Here, we quantified the expressions of all pcsk genes during the 1st week of fish development and in several tissues. pcsk7 expression was ubiquitous and evident already during the early development. To compare mammalian and zebrafish PCSK7, we prepared homology models, which demonstrated remarkable structural conservation. When the PCSK7 function in developing larvae was inhibited, we found that PCSK7-deficient fish have defects in various organs, including the brain, eye, and otic vesicle, and these result in mortality within 7 days postfertilization. A genome-wide analysis of PCSK7-dependent gene expression showed that, in addition to developmental processes, several immune system-related pathways are also regulated by PCSK7. Specifically, the PCSK7 contributed to the mRNA expression and proteolytic cleavage of the cytokine TGFβ1a. Consequently, tgfβ1a morphant fish displayed phenotypical similarities with pcsk7 morphants, underscoring the importance of this cytokine in the zebrafish development. Targeting PCSK activity has emerged as a strategy for treating human diseases. Our results suggest that inhibiting PCSK7 might interfere with normal vertebrate development."

It is noteworthy that we and others have demonstrated that the binding site for fXa located on the heavy chain of the cofactor is composed of a majority of acidic amino acids (17Singh L.S.

Proteolysis of fV and removal of this basic amino acid region may allow for the release of electrostatic restraints and the ability for unactivated fV to show procoagulant activity (i.e. interact with fXa on a procoagulant membrane surface and activate prothrombin). Thus, this mechanism that controls the pro-cofactor would be comparable with certain aspartic and cysteine proteases (23Khan A.R. Khazanovich-Bernstein N. Bergmann E.M. James M.N.

This work was undertaken to explore the significance of the basic amino acid sequence that is almost identical among a wide range of species (Fig. 2) and to understand its role in maintaining fV in a quiescent state. The aim of our study was to verify the hypothesis that amino acid region 1000–1008 provides a specific regulatory sequence that controls the binding of fVa to fXa and thus controls cofactor activity. For this purpose, we constructed several recombinant fV molecules to be assessed for their cofactor and clotting activities as well as for the direct binding to fXa. The results presented herein solidify the notion that only a short and discrete region from the B domain of fV is crucial and is required to keep the pro-cofactor in a quiescent state.

Recombinant fV molecules with mutations, fVRQQ, fVQ3, fVΔB9, and fVΔB9/Q3, were constructed using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. We generated all cleavage activation mutants by changing arginine to glutamine. fVQ3 was constructed using the following mutagenic primers: 5′-GCA TTA GGA ATC CAG TCA TTC CGA AAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTT TCG GAA TGA CTG GAT TCC TAA TGC-3′ (antisense) (corresponding to the R709Q mutation); 5′-CCT TTA TCT CCG CAG ACC TTT CAC CCT C-3′ (sense) and 5′-G AGG GTG AAA GGT CTG CGG AGA TAA AGG-3′ (antisense) (corresponding to R1018Q mutation); and 5′-GCA TGG TAC CTC CAA AGC AAC AAT GG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CC ATT GTT GCT TTG GAG GTA CCA TGC-3′ (antisense) (corresponding to R1545Q mutation). fVΔB9 was constructed using the mutagenic primers 5′-CTG AAG AAA AGC CAG TTT CTC ATT CAC ACA CAC CAT GCT CCT TTA TCT CCG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGG AGA TAA AGG AGC ATG GTG TGT GTG AAT GAG AAA CTG GCT TTT CTT CAG-3′ (antisense) (corresponding to the 1000KTRKKKKEK1008 deletion). To construct fVΔB9/Q3, the same primers were used, and fVQ3 was used as the template in the PCR.

To avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, small aliquots of the purified proteins were stored at −80 °C. Clotting assays using fV-deficient plasma and Western blotting with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies were used to determine the activity and integrity of the recombinant fV molecules as described previously (25Nesheim M.E.

Thrombin was used for the activation of fV and was inhibited by the addition of PMSF. Any residual thrombin used in activation that could potentially contribute to our experimental data were eliminated in the reaction mixtures by the addition of DAPA. All experimental procedures were thoroughly and extensively described previously (17Singh L.S. Bukys M.A. Beck D.O. Kalafatis M.

The absorbance at 490 nm was monitored using an Amersham Biosciences THERMOMAX microplate reader. Because of slight differences in time of incubation with the substrate, in every experiment a plasma fV standard (serial dilutions of purified plasma fV) was run, and all values obtained with the recombinant molecules were compared with the plasma fV standard values within the same 96-well plate. No comparison in concentration was made between recombinant molecules from one plate to another. The determination of the concentration of the recombinant molecules was performed by averaging the value found for each sample run in triplicate. SDS-PAGE analyses were carried out using 4–12% gradient gels or 9.5% gels following reduction with 2% β-mercaptoethanol, according to the method of Laemmli, and the protein was visualized by being stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, followed by destaining in a solution of methanol, acetic acid, and water (30Laemmli U.K. Cleavage of structural proteins during the assembly of the head of bacteriophage T4.Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar). In several experiments, the protein was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes following a modification of the method described by Towbin et al. (31Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Electrophoretic transfer of proteins from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose sheets: procedure and some applications.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar). The membrane transferred proteins were incubated with monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies specific to fV heavy/light chains, and the protein was visualized by immunoreactive chemiluminescence using ECL Plus reagents (GE Healthcare). A discontinuous assay was used to assess the ability of the recombinant fV molecules to assemble in the prothrombinase complex and bind to the enzyme (18Bukys M.A. Blum M.A. Kim P.Y. Brufatto N. Nesheim M.E. Kalafatis M. Incorporation of factor Va into prothrombinase is required for coordinated cleavage of prothrombin by factor Xa.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27393-27401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, fV variants were assayed after (fVa) and before (fV) the activation with thrombin. To determine the dissociation constant (KD(app)) between the fV/fVa molecules and fXa, we prepared separate reaction mixtures that contained PCPS vesicles (where PCPS indicates small unilamellar phospholipids vesicles composed of 75% l-α-phosphatidylcholine and 25% l-α-phosphatidylserine (w/w)) (20 μm), DAPA (3 μm), a limiting fXa concentration (15 pm) and varying concentrations of the recombinant fVa species (30, 60, 125, 250, and 500 pm and 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 nm). The reaction was initiated with a constant and saturating amount of prothrombin (1.4 μm). At selected time intervals into each reaction (20, 40, and 60 s), aliquots were added separately to 80 μl of quench buffer in a 96-well microtiter plate, and the primary thrombin plots (the rate of thrombin generation as a function of time) were measured using Spectrozyme-TH (0.4 mm). The KD(app) of each recombinant fVa species for fXa was then calculated by plotting the data as thrombin activity (nm IIa/min) as a function of the fV/fVa concentration to the equation representing a one binding site model using the software Prism® (GraphPad, San Diego). All experiments were performed at least in duplicate, and the goodness of fit (R2) for the model (equation) tested is provided in each table. In addition, and to avoid any artifacts or inter-experimental variation, all recombinant mutant fV/fVa molecules were assayed at the same time and with the same reagents as the wild type or plasma cofactor molecule, on the same 96-well microtiter plate. The KD(app) obtained directly from the graphs was used to ca"

And, for something so critical to our well-being, it's remarkable that we don't understand why we need to sleep. We may feel our conscious mind shutting off for much of the night and think that our brain is resting, but our brain actually remains very active. And what our brain is doing when we sleep provides a hint about what many neuroscientists believe to be a fundamental role of sleep."
