https://openalex.org/W2306856007,"Skeletal stem cells (SSCs) that are the major source of osteoblasts and adipocytes in adult bone marrow express leptin receptor (LepR). To test whether LepR regulates SSC function, we conditionally deleted Lepr from limb bone marrow stromal cells, but not from the axial skeleton or hypothalamic neurons, using Prx1-Cre. Prx1-Cre;Lepr(fl/fl) mice exhibited normal body mass and normal hematopoiesis. However, limb bones from Prx1-Cre;Lepr(fl/fl) mice exhibited increased osteogenesis, decreased adipogenesis, and accelerated fracture healing. Leptin increased adipogenesis and reduced osteogenesis by activating Jak2/Stat3 signaling in bone marrow stromal cells. A high-fat diet increased adipogenesis and reduced osteogenesis in limb bones from wild-type mice, but not from Prx1-Cre;Lepr(fl/fl) mice. This reflected local effects of LepR on osteogenesis and adipogenesis by bone marrow stromal cells and systemic effects on bone resorption. Leptin/LepR signaling regulates adipogenesis and osteogenesis by mesenchymal stromal cells in the bone marrow in response to diet and adiposity."

However, defining the Nav1.7 contribution to nociceptive signalling has been hampered by a lack of selective inhibitors. Here we report two potent and selective arylsulfonamide Nav1.7 inhibitors; PF-05198007 and PF-05089771, which we have used to directly interrogate Nav1.7's role in nociceptor physiology. We report that Nav1.7 is the predominant functional TTX-sensitive Nav in mouse and human nociceptors and contributes to the initiation and the upstroke phase of the nociceptor action potential. Moreover, we confirm a role for Nav1.7 in influencing synaptic transmission in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord as well as peripheral neuropeptide release in the skin. These findings demonstrate multiple contributions of Nav1.7 to nociceptor signalling and shed new light on the relative functional contribution of this channel to peripheral and central noxious signal transmission."

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) replenish the blood system throughout the lifespan of an organism and maintain homeostasis. Consequently, depletion or impairment of the HSC reservoir leads to hematopoietic failure or hematologic malignancies. Accumulation of DNA damage and genomic instability, due to physiological stress or exposure to genotoxic agents, is one of the mechanisms of loss of the HSC reserve (Garaycoechea et al., 2012Garaycoechea J.I.

Protective cellular DNA repair mechanisms exist in HSCs to combat the accumulation of DNA damage. Accordingly, the genetic ablation of proteins (e.g., Atm, Lig4, and ATR) involved in DNA repair pathways in mice results in severe HSC defects (Ito et al., 2006Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Takubo K.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is the most commonly inherited bone marrow failure (BMF) syndrome. FA patients develop progressive bone marrow failure during childhood. In addition, FA patients also develop other hematologic manifestations, including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), due to clonal evolution (Shimamura and Alter, 2010Shimamura A. Alter B.P. Pathophysiology and management of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.Blood Rev. 2010; 24: 101-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Current therapies for hematologic manifestations in FA include HSC transplant and treatment with growth factors and androgens. While an allogenic bone marrow transplant from a histocompatible sibling donor remains the optimal long-term therapy, many FA patients do not have a suitable donor. Moreover, transplant may contribute to the increased incidence of later non-hematologic consequence, such as secondary solid tumors and endocrine failure (Shimamura and Alter, 2010Shimamura A. Alter B.P. Pathophysiology and management of inherited bone marrow failure syndromes.Blood Rev. 2010; 24: 101-122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Therefore, novel alternative treatment options to treat marrow failure in FA patients are needed. FA is caused by biallelic mutation in 1 of 18 FANC genes (FANC-A, B, C, D1, D2, E, F, G, I, J, L, M, N, O, P, Q, S, and T), the products of which cooperate in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway and regulate cellular resistance to DNA cross-linking agents (Kottemann and Smogorzewska, 2013Kottemann M.C.

Because of the underlying DNA repair defect, FA cells are hypersensitive to genotoxic DNA crosslinking agents. Although the precise biochemical functions of the FA/BRCA pathway in DNA repair remain unclear, the pathway promotes homologous recombination (HR) repair (Deans and West, 2011Deans A.J. West S.C. DNA interstrand crosslink repair and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The FA/BRCA pathway also regulates cytokinesis, and pathway disruption results in increased binucleate bone marrow cells and apoptosis (Chan et al., 2009Chan K.L. Palmai-Pallag T. Ying S.

Cytokinesis failure occurs in Fanconi anemia pathway-deficient murine and human bone marrow hematopoietic cells.J. Clin. Invest. 2010; 120: 3834-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). FA cells are also uniquely hypersensitive to oxidative stress and apoptotic cytokines, such as IFNγ and TNFα (Pang and Andreassen, 2009Pang Q. Andreassen P.R. Fanconi anemia proteins and endogenous stresses.Mutat. Res. 2009; 668: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). All blood lineages are deficient in FA patients (Butturini et al., 1994Butturini A. Gale R.P. Verlander P.C. Adler-Brecher B. Gillio A.P. Auerbach A.D. Hematologic abnormalities in Fanconi anemia: an international Fanconi anemia registry study.Blood. 1994; 84: 1650-1655Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the FA pathway regulates the function of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). Accordingly, recent studies indicate that BMF in FA is attributable to an impaired HSPC pool. HSPCs in FA patients and FA mice exhibit reduced cell number and compromised stem cell function (Ceccaldi et al., 2012Ceccaldi R. Parmar K. Mouly E. Delord M. Kim J.M. Regairaz M. Pla M. Vasquez N.

Fancd2-/- mice have hematopoietic defects that can be partially corrected by resveratrol.Blood. 2010; 116: 5140-5148Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The primary mechanism of the impairment of HSPCs leading to BMF in FA, however, remains elusive. Because of the well-defined role of the FA/BRCA pathway in repairing DNA damage (Deans and West, 2011Deans A.J. West S.C. DNA interstrand crosslink repair and cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, Kottemann and Smogorzewska, 2013Kottemann M.C. Smogorzewska A. Fanconi anaemia and the repair of Watson and Crick DNA crosslinks.Nature. 2013; 493: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), DNA damage accumulation in HSPCs may be one of the major causes of BMF in FA. Indeed, recent studies suggest that BMF in FA and impaired HSPC function are the result of genotoxicity of endogenous crosslinking agents or physiological stress (Garaycoechea et al., 2012Garaycoechea J.I. Crossan G.P. Langevin F. Daly M. Arends M.J. Patel K.J.

Kaschutnig P. et al.Exit from dormancy provokes DNA-damage-induced attrition in haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2015; 520: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Bone marrow failure in FA may also be the result, directly or indirectly, of hyperactivation of cell-autonomous or microenvironmental growth-suppressive pathways, induced in part by genotoxic stress. We have recently shown that one suppressive mechanism is the result of a hyperactive p53 response in HSPCs from FA patients (Ceccaldi et al., 2012Ceccaldi R. Parmar K. Mouly E. Delord M. Kim J.M. Regairaz M. Pla M. Vasquez N. Zhang Q.S. Pondarre C. et al.Bone marrow failure in Fanconi anemia is triggered by an exacerbated p53/p21 DNA damage response that impairs hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 11: 36-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Here, we performed an unbiased small hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen to identify additional growth-suppressive pathways, which may account for the impairment/attrition of the FA bone marrow HSPCs. We identified hyperactive transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling in HSPCs as a mechanism of bone marrow suppression in FA. Disruption of TGF-β signaling significantly protected HSCs in FA from genotoxic stress by increasing HR activity and decreasing NHEJ activity. We initially performed a genome-wide shRNA screen in a patient-derived FANCA−/− fibroblast line in order to identify genes whose knockdown can rescue the FA phenotype in the presence of a genotoxic agent, mitomycin C (MMC) (Figures S1A and S1B). Multiple TGF-β pathway genes (e.g., SMAD3, BMP2, and PDCD4) were among the top hits (Figure 1A). shRNAs targeted against NQO1 and NFE2L2 genes involved in MMC metabolism (Siegel et al., 2012Siegel D. Yan C. Ross D. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in the sensitivity and resistance to antitumor quinones.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2012; 83: 1033-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) also scored positive (Figure 1A), validating our screen for MMC resistance. The TGF-β pathway is known to contribute to hematopoietic suppression in other human diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Suragani et al., 2014Suragani R.N. Cadena S.M. Cawley S.M.

Martelli F. Ciaffoni F. Masiello F. Ghinassi B. D’Amore E. Massa M. Barosi G. Sancillo L. Li X. et al.Characterization of the TGF-β1 signaling abnormalities in the Gata1low mouse model of myelofibrosis.Blood. 2013; 121: 3345-3363Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), suggesting a more general mechanism in BMF. Next, we validated our primary screening data in a number of FA cell lines. The respective cell lines, which were corrected by reconstitution with FANCA or FANCG cDNAs, were used as positive controls as they were more resistant to MMC compared to the uncorrected FA cells (Figures 1B–1D). Both knockdown of SMAD3 and pharmacologic inhibition of the TGF-β pathway with small molecules SD208 and SIS3 significantly enhanced the survival of FA cells in the presence of MMC (Figures 1B–1D and S1C). DNA damage caused by the endogenous genotoxic agent acetaldehyde requires the FA pathway for repair (Garaycoechea et al., 2012Garaycoechea J.I. Crossan G.P. Langevin F. Daly M. Arends M.J. Patel K.J. Genotoxic consequences of endogenous aldehydes on mouse haematopoietic stem cell function.Nature. 2012; 489: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we identified an FA patient-derived FANCG-deficient lymphoblast line, EUFA316, which is hypersensitive to acetaldehyde (Figure S1D). Both pharmacologic inhibition by SD208 and genetic depletion by shRNA of the TGF-β pathway promoted cellular survival in the presence of acetaldehyde (Figures 1E and 1F). Additionally, disruption of the TGF-β pathway by shRNA or SD208 resulted in reduced p53 and p21 protein levels (Figure S1E). Together, these data demonstrate that targeting the TGF-β pathway can reduce the genotoxic stress-mediated growth inhibition of human FA cells. As FA mice exhibit HSPC defects, the possible suppressive function of the TGF-β pathway in bone marrow HSPCs of FA mice was next examined. Elevated expression levels of both Tgfb1 and Smad3 were observed in Fancd2−/− HSPCs (Lin−Sca-1+c-Kit+ [LSK] population) (Figure 2A). Elevated pSmad2/3 protein levels were also observed in Fancd2−/− HSPCs (Figures S2A and S2B). Moreover, enhanced mRNA expression of TGF-β pathway target genes, including Cdkn1a, Cdkn1c, Foxp3, and Atg5, was also observed in Fancd2−/− HSPCs (Figure 2A), implying that the TGF-β pathway is upregulated in FA HSPCs. Fancd2−/− bone marrow HSPCs were more sensitive to TGF-β1 than were wild-type HSPCs (Figure S2C). Therefore, we hypothesized that inhibition of this pathway might rescue the defect of FA HSPCs. Colony-forming assays showed that the clonogenic ability of Fancd2−/− HSPCs was inhibited by TGF-β1; blockade of the TGF-β signaling by 1D11 (a neutralizing antibody against mouse TGF-β) (Brenet et al., 2013Brenet F. Kermani P. Spektor R. Rafii S. Scandura J.M. TGFβ restores hematopoietic homeostasis after myelosuppressive chemotherapy.J. Exp. Med. 2013; 210: 623-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) or SD208 markedly enhanced the clonogenic ability (Figures S2D–S2F). Further, genetic knockdown of Smad3 promoted the in vitro expansion of HSPCs and in vivo engraftment of Lin− cells from bone marrow of Fancd2−/− mice (Figures 2B, 2C, and S2G–S2J). Taken together, inhibition of the TGF-β pathway can rescue the functional defects of Fancd2−/− HSPCs. Hyperactive TGF-β pathway signaling in Fancd2−/− HSPCs prompted us to assess whether the FA pathway components directly transcriptionally regulate the expression of TGF-β pathway genes. We first confirmed that mutation in FA genes results in hyperactive TGF-β activity. We transfected a TGF-β luciferase reporter vector containing SMAD binding element into FA cells or corrected FA cells. Interestingly, increased TGF-β luciferase activity was observed in FA-A cells compared to FANCA-corrected cells (Figure S2K). Conversely, overexpression of FANCD2 in 293T cells significantly reduced the TGF-β luciferase reporter activity (Figure 2D). Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays, we previously showed that activated FANCD2 increases the transcriptional activity of the TAp63 gene (Park et al., 2013Park E. Kim H. Kim J.M. Primack B. Vidal-Cardenas S. Xu Y. Price B.D. Mills A.A. D’Andrea A.D. FANCD2 activates transcription of TAp63 and suppresses tumorigenesis.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 908-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A genome-wide ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq) analysis, using FANCD2 antibody, demonstrated that FANCD2 also binds to SMAD gene promoters (Park et al., 2013Park E. Kim H. Kim J.M. Primack B. Vidal-Cardenas S. Xu Y. Price B.D. Mills A.A. D’Andrea A.D. FANCD2 activates transcription of TAp63 and suppresses tumorigenesis.Mol. Cell. 2013; 50: 908-918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). ChIP confirmed that FANCD2 can directly bind to the promoter region of a SMAD gene, suggesting that FANCD2 decreases the transcriptional activity of SMAD genes. Interestingly, FANCD2 bound to the promoter of SMAD1 in 293T cells (Figure 2E). The binding of FANCD2 to the promoter of SMAD1 was observed in corrected FA cells, but not in the parental FA cells (EUFA316 and GM6914), suggesting that a functional FA pathway is required for the FANCD2-mediated transcriptional decrease of the TGFβ pathway gene (Figures 2F and S2L). Collectively, these results demonstrate that disruption of the FA pathway causes transcriptional changes, resulting in hyperactive TGF-β signaling. DNA damage induced by the endogenous genotoxic agents, such as acetaldehyde, causes the attrition of HSCs, leading to spontaneous bone marrow failure in murine FA models (Garaycoechea et al., 2012Garaycoechea J.I. Crossan G.P. Langevin F. Daly M. Arends M.J. Patel K.J. Genotoxic consequences of endogenous aldehydes on mouse haematopoietic stem cell function.Nature. 2012; 489: 571-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, Langevin et al., 2011Langevin F. Crossan G.P. Rosado I.V. Arends M.J. Patel K.J. Fancd2 counteracts the toxic effects of naturally produced aldehydes in mice.Nature. 2011; 475: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). We reasoned that blockade of the TGF-β pathway may contribute to the repair of acetaldehyde-induced DNA damage in FA HSCs. As expected, bone marrow cells from Fancd2−/− mice were sensitive to acetaldehyde exposure. The neutralizing anti-TGF-β antibody 1D11 treatment counteracted the genotoxic effects of acetaldehyde and rescued the growth and clonogenic capacity of Fancd2−/− HSCs or Lin− cells from bone marrow (Figures 3A and S3A). To directly measure the protective effect of 1D11 on the survival of HSPCs after acetaldehyde exposure, a stem cell transplant was performed. The percentage of donor-derived cells at 4 and 16 weeks post-transplantation was higher in recipients of 1D11-treated Fancd2−/− group than those in the isotype control group (Figures 3B and S3B), and 1D11 did not significantly affect the lineage differentiation of HSPCs (Figure S3C). Furthermore, γH2AX foci, a marker for DNA damage, resolved more rapidly in 1D11-treated Fancd2−/− cells, suggesting an improvement of DNA repair (Figures 3C, 3D, and S3D). Repair of DNA damage was further confirmed by comet assay (Figures 3E, 3F, and S3E). 1D11-treated Fancd2−/− cells also showed improvement in DNA repair when DNA damage was directly assessed by alkaline comet assay and confirmed that acetaldehyde-induced γH2AX foci indeed correspond to unrepaired double strand breaks (Figures 3E, 3F, and S3E). Taken together, pharmacologic inhibition of the TGF-β pathway by 1D11 promotes resistance of FA cells to endogenous genotoxic agents and partially corrects the impaired stem cell function by promoting DNA repair. Physiological stress-induced DNA damage is a source of DNA damage in HSCs in FA. The accumulation of physiological stress-induced DNA damage results in a collapse of the hematopoietic system in a murine FA model (Walter et al., 2015Walter D. Lier A. Geiselhart A. Thalheimer F.B. Huntscha S. Sobotta M.C. Moehrle B. Brocks D. Bayindir I. Kaschutnig P. et al.Exit from dormancy provokes DNA-damage-induced attrition in haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2015; 520: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Interestingly, polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (pI:pC) exposure caused activation of TGF-β pathway in HSPCs (Figure S4A). To determine whether inhibition of the TGF-β pathway also counteracts the genomic instability of HSCs caused by physiological stress, we simultaneously treated WT and Fancd2−/− mice for 48 hr with pI:pC (to induce stress) and 1D11 (to block the TGF-β pathway). As previously described (Walter et al., 2015Walter D. Lier A. Geiselhart A. Thalheimer F.B. Huntscha S. Sobotta M.C. Moehrle B. Brocks D. Bayindir I. Kaschutnig P. et al.Exit from dormancy provokes DNA-damage-induced attrition in haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2015; 520: 549-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), administration of pI:pC induced DNA damage in HSCs and caused increased levels of γH2AX and 53BP1 foci (Figures 4A–4D and S4B); inhibition of the TGF-β pathway by 1D11 markedly reduced the pI:pC-induced DNA damage (Figures 4A–4D, S4B, and S4C). Importantly, inhibition of the TGF-β pathway rescued the viability of Fancd2−/− total bone marrow cells following pI:pC treatment (Figure S4D). Consistent with the previous study (Walter et al., 2015Walter D. Lier A. Geiselhart A. Thalheimer F.B. Huntscha S. Sobotta M.C. Moehrle B. Brocks D. Bayindir I.

As expected, pI:pC exposure induced proliferation of HSPCs, resulting in a concomitant reduction in the frequencies of quiescent cells. Interestingly, 1D11 treatment reduced pI:pC-induced cell cycling and increased the percentage of quiescent HSPCs, perhaps accounting for the improved DNA repair (Figure S4F). Thus, TGF-β pathway inhibition counteracts physiological stress-induced DNA damage in HSCs. To determine whether TGF-β pathway inhibition rescues pI:pC-induced bone marrow failure, we treated WT and Fancd2−/− mice with pI:pC and 1D11 (Figure 4E). Interestingly, 4 weeks of pI:pC treatment caused peripheral blood pancytopenia in isotype control antibody-treated Fancd2−/− mice with reduction in red blood cells (RBC), white blood cells (WBC), and hemoglobin levels (Figure 4F). However, administration of 1D11 significantly prevented these peripheral blood abnormalities (Figure 4F). To examine the bone marrow HSC function, we next transplanted bone marrow cells from these pI:pC-treated (plus or minus 1D11) donor mice into lethally irradiated recipients and evaluated colony-forming units spleen (CFU-S), thus allowing the quantification of the surviving multipotent short-term HSCs. As expected, pI:pC treatment caused a marked reduction in the CFU-S content of Fancd2−/− bone marrow, and 1D11 improved this defect (Figure 4G). Consistent with these results, in a competitive repopulation experiment, recipient mice transplanted with bone marrow from 1D11-treated Fancd2−/− mice showed improved short-term donor cell engraftment compared to the recipients transplanted with isotype control (Figure 4H). Bone marrow HSPCs from Fancd2−/− mice treated with 1D11 also exhibited less DNA damage upon pI:pC exposure (Figures 4I, 4J, and S4G). Together, these data suggest that TGF-β pathway inhibition rescues pI:pC-induced bone marrow failure in FA mice and may be effective in preventing the bone marrow collapse of FA patients observed after viral infections. Next, we extended our studies in HSPCs derived from patients with FA. Primary human FA bone marrow cells demonstrated increased mRNA expression of multiple TGF-β pathway components (Figures 5A and S5A). TGF-β pathway inhibition, by knockdown of SMAD3 or by exposure to anti-human TGF-β neutralizing antibody GC1008, rescued the clonogenic defects of primary HSPCs from bone marrow of FA patients, although to a lesser extent than the rescue observed following p53 knockdown (Figures 5B–5F and S5B). Variable response to TGF-β pathway inhibition in primary human FA patient HSPCs may be the result of differences in the age, gender, intrinsic genetic differences, the levels of SMAD3/p53 in HSPCs, or the severity of the pre-existing bone marrow failure. Depletion of SMAD3 in FA-like primary HSPCs established by FANCD2 knockdown in human cord blood CD34+ cells also rescued their clonogenicity and partially restored MMC resistance (Figures 5G–5I and S5C). Inhibition of TGF-β signaling by GC1008 also recapitulated this phenotype by markedly rescuing the clonogenic capacity of FA-like HSPCs (Figures 5J and S5D). Further, since the very low CD34+ cell numbers in FA patients did not allow efficient xenograft assays for analysis of clonogenicity in vivo, we performed a surrogate in vivo xenograft assay using FA-like CD34+ cells. Strikingly, GC1008 treatment in vivo enhanced the engraftment of primary FA-like CD34+ cells (Figures 5K and S5E). In addition, we observed a higher frequency of FA-like HSPCs with γH2AX and 53BP1 foci upon MMC exposure, compared to the control HSPCs (Figures 5L, 5M, S5F, and S5G). Exposure to GC1008 significantly reduced the number of FA-like HSPCs with γH2AX and 53BP1 foci (Figures 5L, 5M, S5F, and S5G), suggesting that TGF-β pathway inhibition improves DNA repair in these primary human FA-like HSPCs. Together, our data indicate that the TGF-β signaling is increased in human FA HSPCs and that blockade of this pathway partially restores their function. To determine the molecular mechanism by which the TGF-β pathway regulates DNA repair and rescues genotoxicity in HSCs, we next analyzed the expression of DNA repair genes in HSCs. Genes associated with NHEJ, HR, nucleotide excision repair (NER), base excision repair (BER), mismatch repair (MMR), and the DNA damage response and checkpoint (DDRC) were evaluated. Interestingly, over 70% of DNA repair genes examined were significantly upregulated in HSCs fro"

Here we present simple 3D printed microfluidic devices using an inexpensive and readily accessible printer with commercially available printer materials. We demonstrate that previously reported limitations of transparency and fidelity have been overcome, whilst devices capable of operating at pressures in excess of 2000 kPa illustrate that leakage issues have also been resolved. The utility of the 3D printed microfluidic devices is illustrated by encapsulating dental pulp stem cells within alginate droplets; cell viability assays show the vast majority of cells remain live, and device transparency is sufficient for single cell imaging. The accessibility of these devices is further enhanced through fabrication of integrated ports and by the introduction of a Lego®-like modular system facilitating rapid prototyping whilst offering the potential for novices to build microfluidic systems from a database of microfluidic components."
https://openalex.org/W2271425582,"Elastic energy returned from passive-elastic structures of the lower limb is fundamental in lowering the mechanical demand on muscles during running. The purpose of this study was to investigate the two length-modulating mechanisms of the plantar fascia, namely medial longitudinal arch compression and metatarsophalangeal joint (MPJ) excursion, and to determine how these mechanisms modulate strain, and thus elastic energy storage/return of the plantar fascia during running. Eighteen runners (9 forefoot and 9 rearfoot strike) performed three treadmill running trials; unrestricted shod, shod with restricted arch compression (via an orthotic-style insert), and barefoot. Three-dimensional motion capture and ground reaction force data were used to calculate lower limb kinematics and kinetics including MPJ angles, moments, powers and work. Estimates of plantar fascia strain due to arch compression and MPJ excursion were derived using a geometric model of the arch and a subject-specific musculoskeletal model of the plantar fascia, respectively. The plantar fascia exhibited a typical elastic stretch-shortening cycle with the majority of strain generated via arch compression. This strategy was similar in fore- and rear-foot strike runners. Restricting arch compression, and hence the elastic-spring function of the arch, was not compensated for by an increase in MPJ-derived strain. In the second half of stance the plantar fascia was found to transfer energy between the MPJ (energy absorption) and the arch (energy production during recoil). This previously unreported energy transfer mechanism reduces the strain required by the plantar fascia in generating useful positive mechanical work at the arch during running."
https://openalex.org/W2398317311,"The BH3-only protein Bid is known as a critical mediator of the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis following death receptor activation. However, since full-length Bid possesses potent apoptotic activity, the role of a caspase-mediated Bid cleavage is not established in vivo. In addition, due to the fact that multiple caspases cleave Bid at the same site in vitro, the identity of the Bid-cleaving caspase during death receptor signaling remains uncertain. Moreover, as Bid maintains its overall structure following its cleavage by caspase 8, it remains unclear how Bid is activated upon cleavage. Here, Bid-deficient (Bid KO) colon cancer cells were generated by gene editing, and were reconstituted with wild-type or mutants of Bid. While the loss of Bid blocked apoptosis following treatment by TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL), this blockade was relieved by re-introduction of the wild-type Bid. In contrast, the caspase-resistant mutant BidD60E and a BH3 defective mutant BidG94E failed to restore TRAIL-induced apoptosis. By generating Bid/Bax/Bak-deficient (TKO) cells, we demonstrated that Bid is primarily cleaved by caspase 8, not by effector caspases, to give rise to truncated Bid (tBid) upon TRAIL treatment. Importantly, despite the presence of an intact BH3 domain, a tBid mutant lacking the mitochondrial targeting helices (α6 and α7) showed diminished apoptotic activity.

Together, these results for the first time establish that cleavage by caspase 8 and the subsequent association with the outer mitochondrial membrane are two critical events that activate Bid during death receptor-mediated apoptosis. Apoptosis, an efficient cell death program, is primarily mediated through the intrinsic or the extrinsic pathway in response to different stimuli in various cell types. Both pathways lead to the activation of a common set of effector caspases, caspase 3, 6, or 7 (1Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell death: critical control points.Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4037) Google Scholar). In the intrinsic pathway, stress signals, e.g. UV irradiation, serum starvation, DNA damage, etc., elicit discrete intracellular pathways that converge on the mitochondria, causing the release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic proteins. Once in the cytoplasm, cytochrome c triggers formation of the apoptosome, consisting of cytochrome c, Apaf-1, and pro-caspase 9, and leads to the auto-activation of caspase 9 (2Jiang X. Wang X. Cytochrome C-mediated apoptosis.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 87-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). In the extrinsic pathway, the death ligands, Fas/Apo1/CD95 ligand (FasL) 3The abbreviations used are: FasLFas/Apo1/CD95 ligandTRAILTNF-related apoptosis inducing ligandtBidtruncated BidTALENtranscription activator-like effector nucleaseDISCdeath-induced signaling complexMOMPmitochondrial outer membrane permeabilizationDoxdoxycycline. or Apo2L/TRAIL, bind to their cell surface death receptors Fas/Apo-1/CD95 receptor or death receptors 4/5 (DR4/5), respectively, and trigger their trimerization (3Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Death receptors: signaling and modulation.Science. 1998; 281: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (5151) Google Scholar). The trimerized receptors then recruit pro-caspase 8 through the adaptor molecule FADD, and form a death-induced signaling complex (DISC), in which caspase 8 becomes auto-activated (4Ashkenazi A. Dixit V.M. Apoptosis control by death and decoy receptors.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Once activated, either caspase 8 or 9, in turn, cleaves and activates the more abundant downstream effector caspases 3, 6, and 7, initiating the execution stage of apoptosis (5Strasser A. Cory S. Adams J.M. Deciphering the rules of programmed cell death to improve therapy of cancer and other diseases.EMBO J. 2011; 30: 3667-3683Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Fas/Apo1/CD95 ligand TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand truncated Bid transcription activator-like effector nuclease death-induced signaling complex mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization doxycycline. The mitochondrial event responsible for the release of apoptogenic factors in the intrinsic pathway, which is termed mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) is primarily controlled by the Bcl-2 family proteins (6Chipuk J.E. Green D.R. How do BCL-2 proteins induce mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization?.Trends Cell Biol. 2008; 18: 157-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Consisting of both anti- and pro-apoptotic members, the Bcl-2 family is characterized by the presence of at least one of the four Bcl-2 homology domains. The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, Mcl-1, and A1 contain all four BH domains, BH1–4. The pro-apoptotic family members are further divided into the multi-BH domain proteins, i.e. Bax and Bak, and the BH3-only proteins, i.e. Bad, Bim, Bid, Bik, Puma, Hrk, Bmf, and Noxa (7Youle R.J. Strasser A. The BCL-2 protein family: opposing activities that mediate cell death. Nature reviews.Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 47-59Google Scholar). Bax and Bak are recognized as the requisite effectors of MOMP, as their simultaneous loss renders cells highly resistant to most apoptotic stimuli (8Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proapoptotic BAX and BAK: a requisite gateway to mitochondrial dysfunction and death.Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3352) Google Scholar). While the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins negatively regulate the activation and activities of Bax/Bak, the BH3-only proteins are known to either directly or indirectly activate Bax/Bak. In response to different apoptotic stimuli, different subsets of the BH3-only proteins are transcriptionally or post-translationally activated, and in turn trigger Bax/Bak activation (9Huang D.C. Strasser A. BH3-Only proteins-essential initiators of apoptotic cell death.Cell. 2000; 103: 839-842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 10Lomonosova E. Chinnadurai G. BH3-only proteins in apoptosis and beyond: an overview.Oncogene. 2008; 27: S2-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The activated Bax/Bak are responsible for the formation of putative mitochondrial pores, which allow the release of cytochrome c and other apoptogenic factors (11Chipuk J.E. Moldoveanu T. Llambi F. Parsons M.J. Green D.R. The BCL-2 family reunion.Mol. Cell. 2010; 37: 299-310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1173) Google Scholar). In select cell types, e.g. hepatocytes and numerous cancer cell lines, the extrinsic pathway needs to crosstalk with the intrinsic pathway to achieve apoptosis (12Ashkenazi A. Directing cancer cells to self-destruct with pro-apoptotic receptor agonists. Nature reviews.Drug Discovery. 2008; 7: 1001-1012Crossref Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In response to extracellular death ligands, the engaged death receptors instruct formation of the DISC and the activation of caspase 8 in most cells with functional death receptors (13Gonzalvez F. Ashkenazi A. New insights into apoptosis signaling by Apo2L/TRAIL.Oncogene. 2010; 29: 4752-4765Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). These death ligand-responsive cells, however, are classified into Type I and Type II, depending on the requirement of the mitochondria for apoptosis (14Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Two CD95 (APO-1/Fas) signaling pathways.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). In type I cells, the classical extrinsic pathway is in operation, with active caspase 8 directly cleaving and activating the effector caspases (14Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Two CD95 (APO-1/Fas) signaling pathways.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). In type II cells, caspase 8 is unable to efficiently cleave and activate caspase 3, 6, or 7, primarily due to the presence of XIAP, a potent inhibitor of active effector caspases, rendering a halt to the classical extrinsic pathway (15Jost P.J. Grabow S. Gray D. McKenzie M.D. Nachbur U. Huang D.C. Bouillet P. Thomas H.E. Borner C. Silke J. Strasser A. Kaufmann T. XIAP discriminates between type I and type II FAS-induced apoptosis.Nature. 2009; 460: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Yet, this blockade can be efficiently bypassed in these cells by invoking the help from the intrinsic pathway. Instead of cleaving and activating caspase 3 in these cells, active caspase 8 is able to cleave the cytosolic BH3-only protein Bid (16Gross A. Yin X.M. Wang K. Wei M.C. Jockel J. Milliman C.

Active Bax/Bak then mediates the release of cytochrome c and Second Mitochondria-derived Activator of Caspases (SMAC), a highly potent inhibitor of the XIAP protein, and trigger the formation of the apoptosome (19Du C.

The engagement of the mitochondrial pathway through Bid then allows these type II cells to be efficiently killed following the addition of the death ligands (21Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y.

Importantly, most cancer cells are type II cells in which this hybrid pathway, involving the death receptors, caspase 8, Bid, Bax/Bak, and caspase 3, is operational in response to the death ligands (22Kaufmann T. Strasser A. Jost P.J. Fas death receptor signalling: roles of Bid and XIAP.Cell Death Differ. 2012; 19: 42-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Bid is a cytosolic, globular shaped protein primarily composed of eight α-helices, with two central hydrophobic helices cloaked by the remaining six amphipathic helices (23Chou J.J. Li H.

Med. 2000; 192: 1403-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that during death receptor-mediated apoptosis, caspase 8 cleaves Bid at residue Asp-60, the C-terminal fragment of Bid then rapidly associates with the mitochondrial outer membrane, where it triggers Bax/Bak activation (17Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Shamas-Din A. Andrews D.W. Bid: a Bax-like BH3 protein.Oncogene. 2008; 27: S93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, the cleavage of Bid at Asp-60 surprisingly did not alter the overall structure of Bid, suggesting that other event(s), in addition to proteolytic cleavage, is needed to activate Bid. Despite the well-known requirement of both caspase 8 and Bid in cell surface death receptor-mediated apoptosis in mouse liver or in most human cancer cells, the requirement for cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 in death receptor-mediated mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis has remained unclear. This is because an uncleavable full-length Bid mutant was found to possess strong apoptotic and cytochrome c releasing activity in vivo and in vitro (36Sarig R. Zaltsman Y. Marcellus R.C. Flavell R. Mak T.W. Gross A. BID-D59A is a potent inducer of apoptosis in primary embryonic fibroblasts.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10707-10715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, Bid can also be cleaved by the effector caspases, caspase 3/6/7, at Asp-60 during apoptosis (32Slee E.A. Keogh S.A. Martin S.J.

Thus, whether cleavage of Bid at Asp-60 by caspase 8 is responsible for the engagement of the mitochondrial pathway following death receptor activation in type II cells has remained unclear. Moreover, as caspase cleavage failed to elicit a conformational change of Bid (23Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Solution structure of BID, an intracellular amplifier of apoptotic signaling.Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar), how Bid becomes activated remains unknown. In the current study, we generated human colon cancer cells with loss of Bid or combined loss of Bid, Bax, and Bak, and addressed these critical issues by putback experiments. HCT116 cells (ATCC) were cultured in McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). 293GP cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS.

Harvested cells were lysed in EBC buffer (50 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.1 mm PMSF and protease inhibitors (5 mg/ml pepstatin A, 10 mg/ml leupeptin) with a constant rotation for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Following centrifugation at 22,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, supernatant was collected. Approximately 50 μg of total protein from whole cell lysate was resolved by SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane for Western blot. TALEN expression vector for Bid was designed and constructed by Seoul National University, TALEN Library Resource, order H156033. Human Bid cDNA was PCR amplified and ligated into Xho1- and EcoR1-digested pEGFP-C3 (Clontech, 6082-1) vector to generate GFC3-Bid. Standard site-directed mutagenesis was performed on GFC3-Bid plasmid to generate BidD60E and BidG94E mutants. The wild-type and mutants of Bid were then cut out of the EGFP-C3 vector by Xho1 and EcoR1, and ligated into the Xho1/EcoR1 cut retroviral expression vector plasmid pMSCV-PIG (Addgene, plasmid 21654). To construct the CRISPR expression plasmids against Bax and Bak, two pairs of DNA oligos designed for sgRNA targeting the specific site of Bax and Bak were annealed and then ligated into Bbs1 digested px330 vector (Addgene #42230). The wild-type and BidD60E mutant of Bid were cut out of the EGFP-C3 vector by XhoI and EcoRI, and ligated into the XhoI/EcoRI cut EGFP-N2 vector to generate GFN2-Bid and GFN2-BidD60E. Bid-GFP and BidD60E-GFP were then PCR amplified and ligated into XhoI and HindIII digested retroviral MSCV-IRES-GFP vector. The tBid-ΔH6&7 was generated using the PCR “gene SOEing” method (47Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. Gene splicing by overlap extension: tailor-made genes using the polymerase chain reaction.BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant tBid-GFP was PCR amplified from the GFN2 constructs and ligated into NotI and BamHI cut inducible retroviral expression vector plasmid pRetroX-Tight-Pur. The GFP, wt Bid and the BidD60E and BidG94E mutants were PCR amplified and ligated into Not1 and Ecor1 digested inducible retroviral expression vector plasmid pRetroX-Tight-Pur. FugeneHD reagent (Promega, E2311) was used for transfection in HCT116 cells according to manufacturer’s instructions. For human Bid TALEN transfection, 1.5 μg of TALEN construct was used along with 400 ng of mRFP-TS-2A-HYG-EGFP reporter. PcDNA3.1 was added to reach a total DNA concentration of 2 μg per transfection. The transfected cells were split equally into two plates 24 h later, and selected by Hygromycin (1 mg/ml) for 2–3 days. For Bax and Bak CRISPR transfection, 500 ng of Bax CRISPR construct or 500 ng of Bak CRISPR construct was used along with 400 ng mRFP-TS-2A-HYG-EGFP reporter. pcDNA3.1 was added to reach a total DNA of 1.8 μg per transfection. The transfected cells were split equally into two plates 24 h later, and selected by Hygromycin B (1 mg/ml) for 2–3 days. Retroviruses from the pMSCV-PIG vector were produced in 293GP packaging cells as previously described (37Lopez H. Zhang L. George N.M. Liu X. Pang X. Evans J.J. Targy N.M. Luo X.

Virus infection was performed in the Bid KO HCT116 cells in the presence of 10 μg/ml polybrene (American Bioanalytical, AB01643). Puromycin (1 μm) was added to the cells for 3 days before being removed from the medium. The Puromycin-resistant pools were cultured and examined for expression of Bid and its mutants. Inducible cell line in Bid KO HCT116 cells (Bid KO advanced) was made by infecting of pRetro-X-Tet-On Advanced virus as described earlier (38Zhang L. Lopez H. George N.M. Liu X. Pang X. Luo X. Selective involvement of BH3-only proteins and differential targets of Noxa in diverse apoptotic pathways.Cell Death Diff. 2011; 18: 864-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cells were split equally into 2 plates 48 h later and selected by 1 mg/ml G418 for 6 days. The Bid KO advanced cells were then infected with pRetroX-Tight-Pur viruses containing GFP, tBid-GFP, tBidG94E-GFP and tBidΔH6&7-GFP, Bid, BidD60E and BidG94E cDNAs. The infected cells were then selected by 0.5 μg/ml puromycin for 2 days. Genomic DNA was isolated from HCT cells using DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen, 69504), and subjected to polymerase chain reaction to amplify genomic target regions of interest using Phusion or Taq polymerase (New England Biolabs, E0553S and M0273L). PCR was performed according to manufacturer's instructions for each polymerase, and thermocycler settings were adjusted according to product size and optimal primer annealing temperatures. PCR products were cloned into the pGEM T-easy vector (Promega, A1360) using T4 ligase. Following transformation, blue/white selection (Fisher Scientific, BP4200-10) was used to enrich for colonies containing PCR inserts. Miniprep DNAs (Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System, Promega, A1460) from the selected colonies were digested by EcoR1 to determine the sizes of inserts. Plasmids with inserts were then sent for Sanger sequencing using T7 or SP6 primers (UNMC High-Throughput DNA Sequencing and Genotyping Core Facility). 4–5 × 105 cells were seeded in 35-mm plates 16–20 h prior to TRAIL treatment. Human recombinant TRAIL (50 ng/ml) was added to the cells for 4 h before being harvested. Whole cell lysates were prepared as described above and subjected to Western blot with PARP antibody. Quantification of apoptotic cells according to nuclear morphology was performed as previously described (39George N.M. Evans J.J. Luo X. A three-helix homo-oligomerization domain containing BH3 and BH1 is responsible for the apoptotic activity of Bax.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1937-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, following apoptotic treatment, cells were stained with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, H-3570) for 10 min at 37 °C. Pictures of three random viewing areas containing 300–600 cells were taken for each plate. The percentage of cells undergoing nuclear condensation was determined for each viewing area. Immunostaining was essentially performed as described (40Luo X. Sawadogo M. Functional domains of the transcription factor USF2: atypical nuclear localization signals and context-dependent transcriptional activation domains.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1367-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Tom 20 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the paraformaldehyde-fixed cells at 1:200 dilution. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) at 1:500. Pictures of GFP-positive and immunostained cells were taken under a Nikon Eclipse 50i Fluorescence microscope. For mitotracker staining, 2–3 × 105 cells were plated in 35-mm plates with a coverslip at the bottom 24 h prior to staining. Mitotracker (Life Technologies, Inc., M7512) was added at 20 nm. After an incubation of 15 min, the medium was replaced with PBS. The coverslips were then placed on slides and sealed. Pictures of GFP-positive and mitotracker-stained cells were taken under a Nikon Eclipse 50i Fluorescence microscope. To investigate the role of Bid and its processing by caspase-8 in death receptor-mediated apoptosis in type II cells, we employed genome editing to eliminate the Bid protein from HCT116 cells. A TALEN expressing plasmid targeting the central region of Bid (exon 4) was transfected into HCT116 cells together with a reporter plasmid expressing a hygromycin resistance gene. After hygromycin selection, single clones were isolated and screened for the loss of Bid protein by Western blot analysis. Two clones, Bid KO clones 1 and 2, with a loss of the Bid protein (Fig. 1A), were chosen for further analysis by genomic PCR and sequencing. As shown in Fig. 1B, both clones have heterozygous frameshift mutations within the"

Microvascular complications were assessed from 2000-14: early retinopathy (seven-field fundal photography), peripheral nerve function (thermal and vibration threshold testing), autonomic nerve abnormality (heart rate variability analysis of electrocardiogram recordings) and albuminuria (albumin creatinine ratio/timed overnight albumin excretion). Generalized estimating equations (GEE) were used to examine the relationship between treatment and complications rates, adjusting for socio-economic status (SES) and known risk factors including HbA1c and diabetes duration.Comparing CSII with MDI: HbA1C was 8.6% [70mmol/mol] vs. 8.7% [72 mmol/mol]) (p = 0.7), retinopathy 17% vs. 22% (p = 0.06); microalbuminuria 1% vs. 4% (p = 0.07), peripheral nerve abnormality 27% vs. 33% (p = 0.108) and autonomic nerve abnormality 24% vs. 28% (p = 0.401). In multivariable GEE, CSII use was associated with lower rates of retinopathy (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45-0.95, p = 0.029) and peripheral nerve abnormality (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42-0.95, p = 0.026), but not albuminuria (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.10-2.17, p = 0.33). SES was not associated with any of the complication outcomes.In adolescents, CSII use is associated with lower rates of retinopathy and peripheral nerve abnormality, suggesting an apparent benefit of CSII over MDI independent of glycemic control or SES."
https://openalex.org/W2335098396,"Brazilian native fruits are unmatched in their variety, but a poorly explored resource for the development of food and pharmaceutical products. The aim of this study was to evaluate the phenolic composition as well as the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts of leaves, seeds, and pulp of four Brazilian native fruits (Eugenia leitonii, Eugenia involucrata, Eugenia brasiliensis, and Eugenia myrcianthes). GC—MS analyses of the ethanolic extracts showed the presence of epicatechin and gallic acid as the major compounds in these fruits. Antioxidant activity was measured using synthetic DPPH free-radical scavenging, β-carotene bleaching assay, and reactive oxygen species (ROO·, O2·−, and HOCl). The fruit extracts also exhibited antioxidant effect against biologically relevant radicals such as peroxyl, superoxide, and hypochlorous acid. In general, the pulps were the fruit fractions that exhibited the lowest antioxidant activities, whereas the leaves showed the highest ones. The anti-inflammatory activity was assessed in an in vivo model using the carrageenan-induced neutrophil migration assay, which evaluates the inflammatory response in the acute phase. The pulp, seeds, and leaves of these fruits reduced the neutrophil influx by 40% to 64%. Based on these results, we suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of these native fruits is related to the modulation of neutrophil migration, through the inhibition of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, as well as to the antioxidant action of their ethanolic extracts in scavenging the free-radicals released by neutrophils. Therefore, these native fruits can be useful to produce food additives and functional foods."
https://openalex.org/W2325821608,"Density estimates for large carnivores derived from camera surveys often have wide confidence intervals due to low detection rates. Such estimates are of limited value to authorities, which require precise population estimates to inform conservation strategies. Using lures can potentially increase detection, improving the precision of estimates. However, by altering the spatio-temporal patterning of individuals across the camera array, lures may violate closure, a fundamental assumption of capture-recapture. Here, we test the effect of scent lures on the precision and veracity of density estimates derived from camera-trap surveys of a protected African leopard population. We undertook two surveys (a ‘control’ and ‘treatment’ survey) on Phinda Game Reserve, South Africa. Survey design remained consistent except a scent lure was applied at camera-trap stations during the treatment survey. Lures did not affect the maximum movement distances (p = 0.96) or temporal activity of female (p = 0.12) or male leopards (p = 0.79), and the assumption of geographic closure was met for both surveys (p >0.05). The numbers of photographic captures were also similar for control and treatment surveys (p = 0.90). Accordingly, density estimates were comparable between surveys (although estimates derived using non-spatial methods (7.28–9.28 leopards/100km2) were considerably higher than estimates from spatially-explicit methods (3.40–3.65 leopards/100km2). The precision of estimates from the control and treatment surveys, were also comparable and this applied to both non-spatial and spatial methods of estimation. Our findings suggest that at least in the context of leopard research in productive habitats, the use of lures is not warranted."

For 12 weeks, subjects consumed either green tea (>0.56 g/d epigallocatechin-gallate + 0.28 ∼ 0.45 g/d caffeine) or placebo capsules. Fecal samples were collected twice (baseline, vs. week 12) for analyses of total bacterial profiles by means of IS-profiling, a 16S-23S interspacer region-based profiling method.No significant changes between baseline and week 12 in subjects receiving green tea or placebo capsules, and no significant interactions between treatment (green tea or placebo) and time (baseline and week 12) were observed for body composition. Analysis of the fecal samples in subjects receiving green tea and placebo showed similar bacterial diversity and community structures, indicating there were no significant changes in bacterial diversity between baseline and week 12 in subjects receiving green tea capsules or in subjects receiving placebo capsules. No significant interactions were observed between treatment (green tea or placebo) and time (baseline and week 12) for the gut microbial diversity. Although, there were no significant differences between normal weight and overweight subjects in response to green tea, we did observe a reduced bacterial alpha diversity in overweight as compared to normal weight subjects (p = 0.002).Green tea supplementation for 12 weeks did not have a significant effect on composition of the gut microbiota.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01556321."
https://openalex.org/W2322919275,"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) has been associated with improved survival in cancer patients. Within the tumor microenvironment, regulatory cells and expression of co-inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules can lead to the inactivation of TIL. Hence, there is a need to develop strategies that disrupt these negative regulators to achieve robust anti-tumor immune responses. We evaluated the blockade of immune checkpoints and their effect on T cell infiltration and function. We examined the ability of TIL to induce tumor-specific immune responses in vitro and in vivo. TIL isolated from tumor bearing mice were tumor-specific and expressed co-inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules. Administration of monoclonal antibodies against immune checkpoints led to a significant delay in tumor growth. However, anti-PD-L1 antibody treated mice had a significant increase in T cell infiltration and IFN-γ production compared to other groups. Adoptive transfer of in vitro expanded TIL from tumors of anti-PD-L1 antibody treated mice led to a significant delay in tumor growth. Blockade of co-inhibitory immune checkpoints could be an effective strategy to improve TIL infiltration and function."
https://openalex.org/W2319610440,"Bok is a member of the Bcl-2 protein family that governs the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, although the role that Bok plays in this pathway is unclear. We have shown previously in cultured cell lines that Bok interacts strongly with inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP3Rs), suggesting that it may contribute to the structural integrity or stability of IP3R tetramers. Here we report that Bok is similarly IP3R-assocated in mouse tissues, that essentially all cellular Bok is IP3R bound, that it is the helical nature of the Bok BH4 domain, rather than specific amino acids, that mediates binding to IP3Rs, that Bok is dramatically stabilized by binding to IP3Rs, that unbound Bok is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, and that binding to IP3Rs limits the pro-apoptotic effect of overexpressed Bok. Agents that stimulate IP3R activity, apoptosis, phosphorylation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress did not trigger the dissociation of mature Bok from IP3Rs or Bok degradation, indicating that the role of proteasome-mediated Bok degradation is to destroy newly synthesized Bok that is not IP3R associated. The existence of this unexpected proteolytic mechanism that is geared toward restricting Bok to that which is bound to IP3Rs, implies that unbound Bok is deleterious to cell viability and helps explain the current uncertainty regarding the cellular role of Bok."
https://openalex.org/W2327709978,"We hypothesized that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can predispose individuals to lower airway infections and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to upper airway microaspiration. This study evaluated the association between OSA and CAP.We performed a case-control study that included 82 patients with CAP and 41 patients with other infections (control group). The controls were matched according to age, sex and body mass index (BMI). A respiratory polygraph (RP) was performed upon admission for patients in both groups. The severity of pneumonia was assessed according to the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI). The associations between CAP and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), OSA, OSA severity and other sleep-related variables were evaluated using logistic regression models. The associations between OSA, OSA severity with CAP severity were evaluated with linear regression models and non-parametric tests.No significant differences were found between CAP and control patients regarding anthropometric variables, toxic habits and risk factors for CAP. Patients with OSA, defined as individuals with an Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) ≥10, showed an increased risk of CAP (OR = 2·86, 95%CI 1·29-6·44, p = 0·01). Patients with severe OSA (AHI≥30) also had a higher risk of CAP (OR = 3·18, 95%CI 1·11-11·56, p = 0·047). In addition, OSA severity, defined according to the AHI quartile, was also significantly associated with CAP (p = 0·007). Furthermore, OSA was significantly associated with CAP severity (p = 0·0002), and OSA severity was also associated with CAP severity (p = 0·0006).OSA and OSA severity are associated with CAP when compared to patients admitted to the hospital for non-respiratory infections. In addition, OSA and OSA severity are associated with CAP severity. These results support the potential role of OSA in the pathogenesis of CAP and could have clinical implications. This link between OSA and infection risk should be explored to investigate the relationships among gastroesophageal reflux, silent aspiration, laryngeal sensory dysfunction and CAP.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01071421."

For the first time, we show the geospatial distribution of roaster-derived emissions of several chemical species beyond the mine property on otherwise undisturbed taiga shield lakes within a 25 km radius of the mine, 11 years after its closing. Additionally, we demonstrate that underlying bedrock is not a significant source for the elevated concentrations in overlying surface waters. Aquatic arsenic (As) concentrations are well above guidelines for drinking water (10 μg/L) and protection for aquatic life (5 μg/L), ranging up to 136 μg/L in lakes within 4 km from the mine, to 2.0 μg/L in lakes 24 km away. High conversion ratios of methyl mercury were shown in lakes near the roaster stack as well, with MeHg concentrations reaching 44% of total mercury. The risk of elevated exposures by these metals is significant, as many lakes used for recreation and fishing near the City of Yellowknife are within this radius of elevated As and methyl Hg concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2318205901,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are associated with functional inhibition of epithelial Na+/H+ exchange. In mice, a selective disruption of NHE3 (Slc9a3), a major apical Na+/H+ exchanger, also promotes IBD-like symptoms and gut microbial dysbiosis. We hypothesized that disruption of Na+/H+ exchange is necessary for the development of dysbiosis, which promotes an exacerbated mucosal inflammatory response. Therefore, we performed a temporal analysis of gut microbiota composition, and mucosal immune response to adoptive T cell transfer was evaluated in Rag2-/- and NHE3-/-/Rag2-/- (DKO) mice with and without broad-spectrum antibiotics. Microbiome (16S profiling), colonic histology, T cell and neutrophil infiltration, mucosal inflammatory tone, and epithelial permeability were analyzed. In adoptive T cell transfer colitis model, Slc9a3 status was the most significant determinant of gut microbial community. In DKO mice, NHE3-deficiency and dysbiosis were associated with dramatically accelerated and exacerbated disease, with rapid body weight loss, increased mucosal T cell and neutrophil influx, increased mucosal cytokine expression, increased permeability, and expansion of CD25-FoxP3+ Tregs; this enhanced susceptibility was alleviated by oral broad-spectrum antibiotics. Based on these results and our previous work, we postulate that epithelial electrolyte homeostasis is an important modulator in the progression of colitis, acting through remodeling of the gut microbial community."

However, metastasis has not been effectively prevented in clinical therapy and the mechanisms underlying metastasis have not been fully characterized. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα) is a transcriptional regulator with an essential role in tumor metastasis. We used short-activating RNAs (saRNA) to enhance expression of C/EBPα. Intravenous injection of C/EBPα-saRNA in a nude mouse liver orthotopic xenograft tumor model inhibited intrahepatic and distant metastasis. C/EBPα-saRNA-treated mice showed increased serum levels of albumin and decreased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), glutamic-oxalacetic transaminase (AST), indicating a role of C/EBPα in improving liver function. Migration and invasion were inhibited in hepatoma cell lines transfected with C/EBPα-saRNA. We also observed an inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and suppression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), EGFR phosphorylation, and β-catenin in C/EBPa-saRNA-transfected cells. Our results suggested that C/EBPα-saRNA successfully inhibited HCC metastasis by inhibiting EGFR/β-catenin signaling pathway mediated EMT in vitro and in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2316417303,"A quality control system in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) efficiently discriminates polypeptides that are in the process of productive folding from conformers that are trapped in an aberrant state. Only the latter are transported into the cytoplasm and degraded in a process termed ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD). In the ER, an enzymatic cascade generates a specific N-glycan structure of seven mannosyl and two N-acetylglucosamine residues (Man7GlcNAc2) on misfolded glycoproteins to facilitate their disposal. We show that a complex encompassing the yeast lectin-like protein Htm1 and the oxidoreductase Pdi1 converts Man8GlcNAc2 on glycoproteins into the Man7GlcNAc2 signal. In vitro the Htm1-Pdi1 complex processes both unfolded and native proteins albeit with a preference for the former. In vivo, elevated expression of HTM1 causes glycan trimming on misfolded and folded proteins, but only degradation of the non-native species is accelerated. Thus, modification with a Man7GlcNAc2 structure does not inevitably commit a protein for ER-associated protein degradation. The function of Htm1 in ERAD relies on its association with Pdi1, which appears to regulate the access to substrates. Our data support a model in which the balanced activities of Pdi1 and Htm1 are crucial determinants for the efficient removal of misfolded secretory glycoproteins."

As a result, Aldh3a2−/− mice were indistinguishable from wild-type mice in terms of their whole epidermis FALDH activity, and their skin barrier function was uncompromised under normal conditions. However, perturbation of the stratum corneum caused increased transepidermal water loss and delayed barrier recovery in Aldh3a2−/− mice. In conclusion, Aldh3a2−/− mice replicated some aspects of SLS symptoms, especially at the basal layer of the epidermis.

https://openalex.org/W2321199840,"Rewetted, previously drained fens often remain sources rather than sinks for carbon and nutrients. To date, it is poorly understood which soil characteristics stimulate carbon and nutrient mobilization upon rewetting. Here, we assess the hypothesis that a large pool of iron in the soil negatively affects fen restoration success, as flooding-induced iron reduction (Fe3+ to Fe2+) causes a disproportionate breakdown of organic matter that is coupled with a release of inorganic compounds. We collected intact soil cores in two iron-poor and two iron-rich drained fens, half of which were subjected to a rewetting treatment while the other half was kept drained. Prolonged drainage led to the mobilization of nitrate (NO3-, > 1 mmol L-1) in all cores, regardless of soil iron content. In the rewetted iron-rich cores, a sharp increase in pore water iron (Fe) concentrations correlated with concentrations of inorganic carbon (TIC, > 13 mmol L-1) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC, > 16 mmol L-1). Additionally, ammonium (NH4+) accumulated up to phytotoxic concentrations of 1 mmol L-1 in the pore water of the rewetted iron-rich cores. Disproportionate mobilization of Fe, TIC, DOC and NH4+ was absent in the rewetted iron-poor cores, indicating a strong interaction between waterlogging and iron-mediated breakdown of organic matter. Concentrations of dissolved phosphorus (P) rose slightly in all cores upon rewetting, but remained low throughout the experiment. Our results suggest that large pools of iron in the top soil of drained fens can hamper the restoration of the fen's sink-service for ammonium and carbon upon rewetting. We argue that negative effects of iron should be most apparent in fens with fluctuating water levels, as temporary oxygenation allows frequent regeneration of Fe3+. We conclude that rewetting of iron-poor fens may be more feasible for restoration."
https://openalex.org/W2324084999,"IL6 is a multifunctional cytokine that drives terminal B cell differentiation and secretion of immunoglobulins. IL6 also cooperates with IL21 to promote differentiation of CD4+ T follicular helper cells (TFH). Elevated serum levels of IL6 correlate with disease flares in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We previously reported that IL21 produced by TFH plays a critical role in the development of the SLE-like disease of BXSB.Yaa mice. To examine the possible contributions of IL6 to disease, we compared disease parameters in IL6-deficient and IL6-competent BXSB.Yaa mice. We report that survival of IL6-deficient BXSB.Yaa mice was significantly prolonged in association with significant reductions in a variety of autoimmune manifestations. Moreover, B cells stimulated by co-engagement of TLR7 and B cell receptor (BCR) produced high levels of IL6 that was further augmented by stimulation with Type I interferon (IFN1). Importantly, the frequencies of TFH and serum levels of IL21 were significantly reduced in IL6-deficient mice. These findings suggest that high-level production of IL6 by B cells induced by integrated signaling from the IFN1 receptor, TLR7 and BCR promotes the differentiation of IL21-secreting TFH in a signaling sequence that drives the lethal autoimmune disease of BXSB.Yaa mice."
https://openalex.org/W2341016059,"Cryptocercus punctulatus and Parasphaeria boleiriana are two distantly related xylophagous and subsocial cockroaches. Cryptocercus is related to termites. Xylophagous cockroaches and termites are excellent model organisms for studying the symbiotic relationship between the insect and their microbiota. In this study, high-throughput 454 pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA was used to investigate the diversity of metagenomic gut communities of C. punctulatus and P. boleiriana, and thereby to identify possible shifts in symbiont allegiances during cockroaches evolution. Our results revealed that the hindgut prokaryotic communities of both xylophagous cockroaches are dominated by members of four Bacteria phyla: Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. Other identified phyla were Spirochaetes, Planctomycetes, candidatus Saccharibacteria (formerly TM7), and Acidobacteria, each of which represented 1-2% of the total population detected. Community similarity based on phylogenetic relatedness by unweighted UniFrac analyses indicated that the composition of the bacterial community in the two species was significantly different (P < 0.05). Phylogenetic analysis based on the characterized clusters of Bacteroidetes, Spirochaetes, and Deltaproteobacteria showed that many OTUs present in both cockroach species clustered with sequences previously described in termites and other cockroaches, but not with those from other animals or environments. These results suggest that, during their evolution, those cockroaches conserved several bacterial communities from the microbiota of a common ancestor. The ecological stability of those microbial communities may imply the important functional role for the survival of the host of providing nutrients in appropriate quantities and balance."
https://openalex.org/W2326321118,"Herring, Clupea harengus, is one of the ecologically and commercially most important species in European northern seas, where two distinct ecotypes have been described based on spawning time; spring and autumn. To date, it is unknown if these spring and autumn spawning herring constitute genetically distinct units. We assessed levels of genetic divergence between spring and autumn spawning herring in the Baltic Sea using two types of DNA markers, microsatellites and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, and compared the results with data for autumn spawning North Sea herring. Temporally replicated analyses reveal clear genetic differences between ecotypes and hence support reproductive isolation. Loci showing non-neutral behaviour, so-called outlier loci, show convergence between autumn spawning herring from demographically disjoint populations, potentially reflecting selective processes associated with autumn spawning ecotypes. The abundance and exploitation of the two ecotypes have varied strongly over space and time in the Baltic Sea, where autumn spawners have faced strong depression for decades. The results therefore have practical implications by highlighting the need for specific management of these co-occurring ecotypes to meet requirements for sustainable exploitation and ensure optimal livelihood for coastal communities."
https://openalex.org/W2334033731,"Aims Baseline HbA1c is a major predictor of response to glucose lowering therapy and therefore a potential confounder in studies aiming to identify other predictors. However, baseline adjustment may introduce error if the association between baseline HbA1c and response is substantially due to measurement error and regression to the mean. We aimed to determine whether studies of predictors of response should adjust for baseline HbA1c. Methods We assessed the relationship between baseline HbA1c and glycaemic response in 257 participants treated with GLP-1R agonists and assessed whether it reflected measurement error and regression to the mean using duplicate ‘pre-baseline’ HbA1c measurements not included in the response variable. In this cohort and an additional 2659 participants treated with sulfonylureas we assessed the relationship between covariates associated with baseline HbA1c and treatment response with and without baseline adjustment, and with a bias correction using pre-baseline HbA1c to adjust for the effects of error in baseline HbA1c. Results Baseline HbA1c was a major predictor of response (R2 = 0.19,β = -0.44,p<0.001).The association between pre-baseline and response was similar suggesting the greater response at higher baseline HbA1cs is not mainly due to measurement error and subsequent regression to the mean. In unadjusted analysis in both cohorts, factors associated with baseline HbA1c were associated with response, however these associations were weak or absent after adjustment for baseline HbA1c. Bias correction did not substantially alter associations. Conclusions Adjustment for the baseline HbA1c measurement is a simple and effective way to reduce bias in studies of predictors of response to glucose lowering therapy."

Methods Participants were drawn from the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort (n = 3,414), a randomly selected Mexican-American cohort in Texas on the US-Mexico border. Moderate and vigorous physical activity was assessed using reliable and validated instruments. The metabolic syndrome was defined as having 3 or more metabolic abnormalities. Results One thousand five hundred and twenty-four participants of the cohort (45.02%) were found to have the metabolic syndrome. Compared to participants who did not meet US physical activity guidelines, participants who met physical activity guidelines of 150 moderate and vigorous minutes per week (≥ 600 MET adjusted minutes) had 36% lower risk for the metabolic syndrome (OR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.42–0.98), and participants with total minutes per week of moderate and vigorous/strenuous activity greater than 743 MET adjusted minutes had 37% lower risk for the metabolic syndrome (OR = 0.63; 95% CI: 0.42–0.94) compared with their counterparts, after adjusting for age, gender, annual household income, body mass index, smoking and alcohol drinking status, total portions of fruit and vegetable intake, census tracts and blocks, and survey version for physical activity. Conclusions Meeting or exceeding physical activity guidelines significantly was inversely associated with the risk for the metabolic syndrome in Mexican-Americans. Improving levels of physical activity appears to be an effective target for the metabolic syndrome prevention and control among Mexican-Americans independent of other factors."
https://openalex.org/W2335490685,"The contribution of circulating antibody to the protection of naïve piglets against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was evaluated using a passive antibody transfer model. Piglets (n = 62) derived from 6 sows were assigned to one of 6 different treatments using a randomized block design which provided for allocation of all treatments to all sows' litters. Each treatment was designed to achieve a different level of circulating anti-PEDV antibody via intraperitoneally administration of concentrated serum antibody. Piglets were orally inoculated with PEDV (USA/IN/2013/19338E, 1 x 103 TCID50 per piglet) 24 hours later and then monitored for 14 days. Piglets remained with their dam throughout the experiment. Sow milk samples, piglet fecal samples, and data on piglet clinical signs, body weight, and body temperature were collected daily. Fecal samples were tested by PEDV real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. Serum, colostrum, and milk were tested for PEDV IgG, IgA, and virus-neutralizing antibody. The data were evaluated for the effects of systemic PEDV antibody levels on growth, body temperature, fecal shedding, survival, and antibody response. The analysis showed that circulating antibody partially ameliorated the effect of PEDV infection. Specifically, antibody-positive groups returned to normal body temperature faster and demonstrated a higher rate of survivability than piglets without PEDV antibody. When combined with previous literature on PEDV, it can be concluded that both systemic antibodies and maternal secretory IgA in milk contribute to the protection of the neonatal pig against PEDV infections. Overall, the results of this experiment suggested that passively administered circulating antibodies contributed to the protection of neonatal piglets against PEDV infection."
https://openalex.org/W2315721171,"Introduction Chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis is an inflammatory disease that, although not directly linked to allergy, often displays a Th2-skewed inflammation characterized by elevated local IgE and IL-5 levels. The nasal cavity is constantly exposed to bacteria and viruses that may trigger epithelial inflammatory responses. To gain more insight into mechanisms by which such a biased inflammation might arise, we have investigated the epithelial expression of the Th2 skewing mediators (TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33) in relationship to disease and microbial triggers. Methods Epithelial cells were obtained from polyp tissues of nasal polyposis patients and from inferior turbinates of non-diseased controls. Cells were exposed to various TLR-specific triggers to study the effect on mRNA and protein expression level of TSLP, IL-25, and IL-33 and the potential regulatory mechanisms through the expression profile the transcription factors ATF-3, DUSP-1, EGR-1, and NFKB-1. Results The TLR3 agonist and viral analogue poly(I:C) induced TSLP mRNA 13.0 ± 3.1 fold (p < 0.05) and protein expression by 12.1 ± 2.3-fold (p < 0.05) higher in epithelium isolated from nasal polyposis patients than in epithelium form healthy controls. This enhanced induction of TSLP may be a consequence of a down-regulated expression of DUSP-1 in polyp epithelium. Conclusion The TLR3 induced expression of TSLP introduces a mechanism by which the Th2-skewed tissue environment might arise in nasal polyps and invites a further evaluation of the potential contribution of current or past viral infections to polyposis pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2324566364,"Introduction The burden of HPV-related Head and Neck Cancers (HNC) has been rising in the U.S. and other developed countries but this trend has not been reported in Africa. Objective of study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPV infection in HNC cancer cases seen between 1990 and 2011 at the tertiary health care institutions in Nigeria. Methods We retrieved 149 head and neck cancer formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor specimens diagnosed between 1990 and 2011 from four teaching hospitals in Nigeria. One hundred and twenty-three blocks (83%) contained appropriate HNC for analysis while DNA extraction was successful in 60% (90/149). PCR amplification was successful in 33% (49/149) and Linear Array genotyping for HPV was successful in 11% (17/149) of these cases. These were in tumors from the larynx (6), cervical lymph nodes (3), nasal cavity (2), parotid (1), palate (1), maxillary sinus (1) and mandible (1). Two cases were non-specific and none were from the oropharynx. Histologically, 41% (7/17) of the successfully genotyped blocks were squamous cell carcinomas (larynx 6, maxillary sinus 1). Results and Conclusion We were unable to detect HPV in any of the HNC samples in our study. Our result may suggest that there is a low prevalence of HPV-related HNC among the adult population in Nigeria. Our results provide a benchmark to compare future incidence of HPV -related HNC in this community in future. We had significant analytical challenges from possible poor tissue processing and urge that future studies should prospectively collect samples and ensure high quality sample processing."
https://openalex.org/W2324594830,"The immutans (im) variegation mutation of Arabidopsis has green- and white- sectored leaves due to action of a nuclear recessive gene. IM codes for PTOX, a plastoquinol oxidase in plastid membranes. Previous studies have revealed that the green and white sectors develop into sources (green tissues) and sinks (white tissues) early in leaf development. In this report we focus on white sectors, and show that their transformation into effective sinks involves a sharp reduction in plastid number and size. Despite these reductions, cells in the white sectors have near-normal amounts of plastid RNA and protein, and surprisingly, a marked amplification of chloroplast DNA. The maintenance of protein synthesis capacity in the white sectors might poise plastids for their development into other plastid types. The green and white im sectors have different cell wall compositions: whereas cell walls in the green sectors resemble those in wild type, cell walls in the white sectors have reduced lignin and cellulose microfibrils, as well as alterations in galactomannans and the decoration of xyloglucan. These changes promote susceptibility to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Enhanced susceptibility can also be explained by repressed expression of some, but not all, defense genes. We suggest that differences in morphology, physiology and biochemistry between the green and white sectors is caused by a reprogramming of leaf development that is coordinated, in part, by mechanisms of retrograde (plastid-to-nucleus) signaling, perhaps mediated by ROS. We conclude that variegation mutants offer a novel system to study leaf developmental programming, cell wall metabolism and host-pathogen interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2318862053,"Many species of animals deliver vocalizations in sequences presumed to be governed by internal rules, though the nature and complexity of these syntactical rules have been investigated in relatively few species. Here I present an investigation into the song syntax of fourteen male Cassin’s Vireos (Vireo cassinii), a species whose song sequences are highly temporally structured. I compare their song sequences to three candidate models of varying levels of complexity–zero-order, first-order and second-order Markov models–and employ novel methods to interpolate between these three models. A variety of analyses, including sequence simulations, Fisher’s exact tests, and model likelihood analyses, showed that the songs of this species are too complex to be described by a zero-order or first-order Markov model. The model that best fit the data was intermediate in complexity between a first- and second-order model, though I also present evidence that some transition probabilities are conditioned on up to three preceding phrases. In addition, sequences were shown to be predictable with more than 54% accuracy overall, and predictability was positively correlated with the rate of song delivery. An assessment of the time homogeneity of syntax showed that transition probabilities between phrase types are largely stable over time, but that there was some evidence for modest changes in syntax within and between breeding seasons, a finding that I interpret to represent changes in breeding stage and social context rather than irreversible, secular shifts in syntax over time. These findings constitute a valuable addition to our understanding of bird song syntax in free-living birds, and will contribute to future attempts to understand the evolutionary importance of bird song syntax in avian communication."
https://openalex.org/W2326880940,"Response to treatment of rheumatoid arthritis shows large inter-individual variability. This heterogeneity is observed with all the anti-rheumatic drugs, including the commonly used TNF inhibitors. It seems that drug-specific and target-specific factors lead individual patients to respond or not to a given drug, although this point has been challenged. The search of biomarkers distinguishing responders from non-responders has included shotgun proteomics of serum, as a previous study of response to infliximab, an anti-TNF antibody. Here, we have used the same study design and technology to search biomarkers of response to a different anti-TNF antibody, adalimumab, and we have compared the results obtained for the two anti-TNF drugs. Search of biomarkers of response to adalimumab included depletion of the most abundant serum proteins, 8-plex isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling, two-dimensional liquid chromatography fractionation and relative quantification with a hybrid Orbitrap mass spectrometer. With this approach, 264 proteins were identified in all the samples with at least 2 peptides and 95% confidence. Nine proteins showed differences between non-responders and responders (P < 0.05), representing putative biomarkers of response to adalimumab. These results were compared with the previous study of infliximab. Surprisingly, the non-responder/responder differences in the two studies were not correlated (rs = 0.07; P = 0.40). This overall independence with all the proteins showed two identifiable components. On one side, the putative biomarkers of response to either adalimumab or infliximab, which were not shared and showed an inverse correlation (rs = -0.69; P = 0.0023). On the other, eight proteins showing significant non-responder/responder differences in the analysis combining data of response to the two drugs. These results identify new putative biomarkers of response to treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and indicate that they are notably drug-specific."

Here, we report unexpected anticancerogenic effects of hydroethanolic Iberis amara extract (IAE), which is known as a widely used phytomedical product for treating gastrointestinal complaints. IAE significantly inhibited the proliferation of HT-29 and T84 colon carcinoma cells with an inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 6 and 9 μg/ml, respectively, and further generated inhibitory effects in PC-3 prostate and MCF7 breast cancer cells. Inhibition of proliferation in HT-29 cells was associated with a G2/M phase cell cycle arrest including reduced expression of various regulatory marker proteins. Notably, in HT-29 cells IAE further induced apoptosis by intracellular formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Consistent with predictions derived from our in vitro experiments, bidaily oral gavage of 50 mg/kg of IAE over 4 weeks resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth in a mouse HT-29 tumor xenograft model. Taken together, Iberis amara extracts could become useful alternatives for preventing and treating the progression of colon cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2325656490,"Aims Patients with heart failure often display a distinct pattern of walking characterized by short step-length and frequent short pauses. In the current study we sought to explore if qualitative aspects of movement have any additive value to established factors to predict all-cause mortality in patients with advanced heart failure. Methods and results 60 patients with advanced heart failure (NYHA III, peak VO2 <20 ml/kg and LVEF <35%) underwent symptom-limited CPX, echocardiography and routine chemistry. Physical activity was assessed using an accelerometer worn attached to the waist during waking hours for 7 consecutive days. The heart-failure survival score (HFSS) was calculated for each patient. All accelerometer-derived variables were analyzed with regard to all-cause mortality and added to a baseline model utilizing HFSS scores. HFSS score was significantly associated with the incidence of death (P<0.001; c-index 0.71; CI, 0.67–0.73). The addition of peak skewness to the HFSS model significantly improved the predictive ability with an increase in c-index to 0.74 (CI, 0.69–0.78), likelihood ratio P<0.02, establishing skewness as a predictor of increased event rates when accounting for baseline risk. Conclusion The feature skewness, a measure of asymmetry in the intensity level of periods of high physical activity, was identified to be predictive of all-cause mortality independent of the established prognostic model–HFSS and peak VO2. The findings from the present study emphasize the use of accelerometer analysis in clinical practice to make more accurate prognoses in addition to extract features of physical activity relevant to functional classification."

We aimed to estimate the incidence of SBI and their risk factors in a large prospective cohort of PLHIV patients over a 13-year period in France. Patients followed up in the ANRS CO3 Aquitaine cohort between 2000 and 2012 were eligible; SBI was defined as a clinical diagnosis associated with hospitalization of ≥48 hours or death. Survival analysis was conducted to identify risk factors for SBI.Total follow-up duration was 39,256 person-years [PY] (31,370 PY on antiretroviral treatment [ART]). The incidence of SBI decreased from 26.7/1000 PY [95% CI: 22.9–30.5] over the period 2000–2002 to 11.9/1000 PY [10.1–13.8] in 2009–2012 (p <0.0001). Factors independently associated to increased risk of SBI were: plasma HIVRNA>50 copies/mL (Hazard Ratio [HR] = 5.1, 95% Confidence Interval: 4.2–6.2), CD4 count <500 cells/mm3 and CD4/CD8 ratio <0.8 (with a dose-response relationship for both markers), history of cancer (HR = 1.4 [1.0–1.9]), AIDS stage (HR = 1.7 [1.3–2.1]) and HCV coinfection (HR = 1.4, [1.1–1.6]). HIV-positive patients with diabetes were more prone to SBI (HR = 1.6 [0.9–2.6]). Incidence of SBI decreased over a 13-year period due to the improvement in the virological and immune status of PLHIV on ART. Risk factors for SBI include low CD4 count and detectable HIV RNA, but also CD4/CD8 ratio, HCV coinfection, history of cancer and diabetes, comorbid conditions that have been frequent among PLHIV in recent years."

QS contributes to the development of acute infections by coordinating the production of multiple virulence factors, including elastase and pyocyanin, and the formation of biofilms (5Schuster M.

QS in P. aeruginosa is largely mediated by N-acyl l-homoserine lactone autoinducer molecules, biosynthesized by LuxI-type synthases, and detected by LuxR-type regulator proteins (8Fuqua C.

Like other LuxR-type proteins, this transcription factor is composed of two domains (11Churchill M.E. Chen L. Structural basis of acyl-homoserine lactone-dependent signaling.Chem.

The amino-terminal ligand binding domain (LBD) specifically recognizes its autoinducer, N-(3-oxo-dodecanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3O-C12-HSL), promoting protein folding and dimerization, whereas the DNA binding domain (DBD) recognizes target sites to activate downstream gene expression. There has been significant interest in understanding LasR, as its inhibition represents a promising antivirulence strategy for the treatment of P. aeruginosa. One prevalent mode of inhibition is the development of non-native small molecules shown to disrupt LasR function through the reduction of virulence factors produced (12Galloway W.R.J.D. Hodgkinson J.T. Bowden S.D. Welch M. Spring D.R. Quorum sensing in Gram-negative bacteria: small-molecule modulation of AHL and AI-2 quorum sensing pathways.Chem.

A number of these analogs appear to inhibit LasR through competition with the native 3O-C12-HSL because they are often structurally similar. Recent work has also revealed a somewhat unexpected role for LasR in oxidative sensing (15Deng X. Weerapana E. Ulanovskaya O. Sun F. Liang H. Ji Q. Ye Y. Fu Y. Zhou L. Li J. Zhang H. Wang C.

A proteome-wide screen of P. aeruginosa to detect H2O2-sensitive cysteines identified Cys79 of LasR. Subsequent experiments in P. aeruginosa indicated that a LasR-C79A mutant strain showed decreased motility and proteolysis, highlighting Cys79 as important for LasR QS function. The link between LasR and oxidative stress response was supported by Northern hybridization analysis that revealed that the RNA level of lasI, under LasR control, was reduced after cells were treated with H2O2. Complementation studies with a LasR deletion strain showed that LasR function was restored when complemented with wild-type plasmid p-lasR but diminished by about half when cells were treated with 5 mm H2O2. Interestingly, complementation with mutant plasmid p-lasR-C79S was only partially successful but did not change significantly in the presence of oxidant. Complementation with p-lasR-C79A resulted in negligible LasR activity even in the absence of oxidant. Taken together, these findings suggest that LasR responds to both its autoinducer and oxidative stress. Numerous bacterial proteins have been shown to respond to oxidative stress through redox-sensitive thiols, including the OxyR, HypT, and MgrA transcription factors (16Chen P.R. Brugarolas P. He C. Redox signaling in human pathogens.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2011; 14: 1107-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 17Zheng M. Aslund F. Storz G.

Role of cysteines in the stability and DNA-binding activity of the hypochlorite-specific transcription factor HypT.PLoS ONE. 2013; 8e75683 Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although these proteins are important for regulating pathogen response to potentially damaging oxidants, they are not known to be associated with QS. In addition to the recent finding that LasR may be governed by both oxidants and QS autoinducers, several other bacterial regulators have been linked to a similar dual function. Staphylococcus aureus AgrA has been shown to form an intramolecular disulfide bond within its DBD when oxidized, leading to a reduction in DNA binding affinity (19Sun F. Liang H. Kong X. Xie S. Cho H. Deng X. Ji Q. Zhang H. Alvarez S. Hicks L.M. Bae T. Luo C. Jiang H. He C. Quorum-sensing agr mediates bacterial oxidation response via an intramolecular disulfide redox switch in the response regulator AgrA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2012; 109: 9095-9100Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Additionally, Escherichia coli SdiA, a LuxR homolog like LasR, forms an intermolecular disulfide bond within its DBD, covalently linking two monomers and altering promoter binding affinity when oxidized with the addition of 2 mm H2O2 in EMSAs (20Kim T. Duong T. Wu C.A. Choi J. Lan N. Kang S.W. Lokanath N.K. Shin D. Hwang H.Y. Kim K.K. Structural insights into the molecular mechanism of Escherichia coli SdiA, a quorum-sensing receptor.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2014; 70: 694-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These studies provide additional evidence for a possible intersection between QS and oxidative sensing in bacterial regulator proteins. In this work, we probed the mechanism for the reported LasR sensitivity to oxidative stress to further characterize this important transcriptional regulator at the biochemical level. Our exploration of Cys79 revealed that this residue is important for ligand recognition and protein folding, but it does not seem to be sensitive to oxidative stress when LasR is autoinducer-bound and folded. Instead, we have identified two cysteines in the DBD of LasR, Cys201 and Cys203, which appear to modulate DNA binding affinity through the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond in the presence of H2O2. Additionally, mutagenesis of either of these residues leads to poor protein overexpression and loss of DNA binding, underscoring their critical role in functional LasR. Results from these in vitro assays with purified protein were further supported by parallel studies using E. coli transformed with a plasmid containing both the lasR gene and a lasB-lacZ detection system (21Pearson J.P. Gray K.M. Passador L. Tucker K.D. Eberhard A. Iglewski B.H. Greenberg E.P. Structure of the autoinducer required for expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Experiments with this reporter gene system also demonstrated the critical importance of Cys201 and Cys203 for LasR function in a cell-based assay and indicated the down-regulation of LasR activity in the presence of H2O2. Taken together, our results add to the growing collective understanding of LasR, supporting a possible additional role for this protein as an oxidative sensor and suggesting new ways in which this pathogenic regulator may be handicapped. The P. aeruginosa PA01 lasR gene was amplified by PCR from a lasR-containing pDONR201 vector obtained from the Harvard Medical School PlasmID Repository. Using incorporated NotI and NcoI restriction sites, the lasR insert was ligated into the pET28b (Novagen) expression vector to yield plasR. Similarly, the lasR fragment (nucleotides 1–519) corresponding to the LasR LBD (amino acid residues 1–173) (22Bottomley M.J. Muraglia E. Bazzo R. Carfì A. Molecular insights into quorum sensing in the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa from the structure of the virulence regulator LasR bound to its autoinducer.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13592-13600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) was amplified and cloned into the NdeI/NotI sites of the pET24b vector to yield pLBD. The lasR fragment (nucleotides 523–720) corresponding to amino acid residues 175–240 with added N-terminal Met was amplified and cloned into the NotI/NcoI sites of pET28b to yield pDBD. Generation of Cys79, Cys188, Cys201, and Cys203 mutants was achieved using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies). All constructs were sequenced to confirm correct gene insertion and desired mutations (DNA Analysis Facility, Yale University). For expression of all proteins, BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the expression plasmid of interest and grown in Luria broth medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. For the expression of LasR and LBD, growth medium was additionally supplemented with 20 μm 3O-C12-HSL (Sigma-Aldrich) or non-native AHLs. Cultures were grown to A600 = 0.8 at 37 °C, protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 400 μm, and growth continued for an additional 24 h at 23 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, with pellets stored at −80 °C. Harvested cells resulting from 0.5 liter of culture were resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 200 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Lysis buffer was supplemented with 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for the purification of LasR and DBD. Resuspended cells were lysed by sonication and clarified by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was incubated with 0.25 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen) for 2 h at 4 °C. The resin was decanted into a column and washed with 5 ml of 5 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. C-terminally His6-tagged LasR, LBD, or DBD protein was eluted with a step gradient of 30, 60, 100, 250, and 500 mm imidazole in lysis buffer. Fractions containing the desired protein as judged by SDS-PAGE were pooled and dialyzed against dialysis buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 200 mm NaCl, and 10% (v/v) glycerol, with 1 mm DTT added for LasR and DBD purification). LasR purified without DTT in dialysis buffer was not an active DNA-binding protein. AHL derivatives were prepared by coupling acyl carboxylic acids with l-homoserine lactone in the presence of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide as described previously (23Chhabra S.R. Stead P. Bainton N.J. Salmond G.P. Stewart G.S. Williams P. Bycroft B.W. Autoregulation of carbapenem biosynthesis in Erwinia carotovora by analogues of N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone.J. Antibiot. 1993; 46: 441-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Product identity and purity were confirmed by 1H NMR (500 MHz Agilent DD2-500 NMR), with comparison to known characterization data for each compound (24Geske G.D. Wezeman R.J. Siegel A.P. Blackwell H.E. Small molecule inhibitors of bacterial quorum sensing and biofilm formation.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 12762-12763Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). To measure the impact of oxidants on LBD dimerization, 25 μm LBD or LBD C79S was combined with 2.5 mm H2O2, 2.5 mm cumene hydroperoxide, or water as a control and incubated for 3 h at 25 °C. LBD and LBD C79S samples were diluted in non-reducing SDS sample buffer and separated using 12% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). Samples containing 100 mm DTT in sample buffer were incubated for 10 min at 25 °C prior to electrophoresis. Detection, excision, and elution of protein bands for mass spectrometric confirmation of molecular weight followed established methods (25Castellanos-Serra L. Hardy E. Negative detection of biomolecules separated in polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1544-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). LBD expressed in the presence of non-native AHLs was also diluted in non-reducing SDS sample buffer and resolved on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. LBD (25 μm) was combined with 0–200 μm H2O2 in native (100 mm sodium phosphate and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) or denaturing (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 100 mm sodium phosphate, and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) buffer and incubated for 1 h at 25 °C. To detect free thiols, 180 μm 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) was added and incubated for 15 min at 25 °C, and the absorbance of each sample was measured at 412 nm. The concentration of 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate, released upon reaction between free thiols and DTNB, was calculated using this absorbance and known extinction coefficients for 2-nitro-5-thiobenzoate under native and denaturing conditions (26Riddles P.W. Blakeley R.L. Zerner B. Ellman's reagent: 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid): a reexamination.Anal. Biochem. 1979; 94: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). Far-UV CD spectra of wild-type and mutant LBD (15 μm in 100 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0)) expressed in the presence of varied AHLs were measured with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cuvette. Data were acquired at 10 °C, and spectra represent the average of four scans for each sample. Temperature-dependent CD analysis at 222 nm from 10–90 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min permitted determination of melting temperature (Tm) using the Jasco Spectra Analysis software to fit data. Binding reactions were performed in binding buffer (0.7 mm KH2PO4, 2.15 mm Na2HPO4, 1.35 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100, 5% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA (pH 7.4)). A 43-mer DNA duplex containing the lasB OP1 site (5′-ATCAAGGCTACCTGCCAGTTCTGGCAGGTTTGGCCGCGGGTTC-3′ annealed to its complementary strand) with 5′ modification of the top strand with fluorescein (6-FAM, Integrated DNA Technologies) was used for all binding assays. For quantitative binding assays, serial dilutions of LasR, LasR mutants, and DBD were incubated with 100 nm lasB OP1 for 30 min at 25 °C before binding reactions were applied to a nondenaturing 6% polyacrylamide DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) with 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA as the electrophoresis running buffer. The amounts of complexed and free DNA were visualized and quantified using a Gel Doc EZ system (Bio-Rad). Equilibrium dissociation constants were determined as described previously (27Baranger A.M. Palmer C.R. Hamm M.K. Giebler H.A. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Mechanism of DNA-binding enhancement by the human T-cell leukaemia virus transactivator Tax.Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Assays to test the impact of H2O2 on DNA binding were performed under the same conditions, with incubation with oxidant for 30 min at 25 °C either before or after incubation with target DNA as noted. The low millimolar concentration of H2O2 used in these EMSA assays is common practice for the in vitro evaluation of the impact of oxidant on regulator protein-DNA binding affinity (18Drazic A.

To evaluate recovery of binding with DTT, samples were incubated for an additional 30 min at 25 °C in the presence of excess reducing agent (25 mm DTT). DBD (64 μm) was reacted with 45 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at 25 °C to give alkylated DBD for gel shift analysis. All mass spectral analyses were performed by tandem HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using a Thermo Finnigan Surveyor HPLC system and a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL mass spectrometer. In preparation for LC-MS analysis, 2.5 μm LasR C79S/C188S and LasR C79S each were incubated with 3 mm H2O2 for 2 h at 25 °C, followed by reaction with 45 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h at 25 °C to cap any remaining free thiols. Digestion of LasR C79S/C188S proceeded with the addition of Glu-C (Promega) to 3.5 ng/μl in 50 mm NH4HCO3 (pH 8.0) with incubation at 37 °C for 18 h. Digested proteins were subjected to LC-MS, with ions of interest selected and subjected to collision-induced dissociation (MS/MS) to confirm peptide identity. XL10-Gold E. coli cells (Agilent Technologies) were transformed with plasmid pKDT17 to yield a reporter strain coupling the lasR gene with a lasB::lacZ translational fusion (21Pearson J.P. Gray K.M. Passador L. Tucker K.D. Eberhard A. Iglewski B.H. Greenberg E.P. Structure of the autoinducer required for expression of Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence genes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). pKDT17 was a gift from Peter Greenberg (Addgene plasmid 27503). Site-directed mutagenesis of pKDT17 to convert LasR Cys79, Cys188, Cys201, and Cys203 to serine was achieved using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) and confirmed by DNA sequencing (DNA Analysis Facility, Yale University). Using this reporter strain, LasR activity was quantified as a function of β-galactosidase activity as measured in Miller assays (31Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) using the modified procedure reported previously (32Zhang X. Bremer H. Control of the Escherichia coli rrnB P1 promoter strength by ppGpp.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11181-11189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Starting with a 1/1000-fold dilution of an overnight culture, the reporter strain was grown at 37 °C with shaking in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (200 μg/ml) to A600 = 0.8–1.2. Cultures also included 20 μm 3O-C12-HSL and 10–100 μm H2O2 as noted. Subsequent dilution, permeabilization, and β-galactosidase activity assays were performed as described previously (32Zhang X. Bremer H. Control of the Escherichia coli rrnB P1 promoter strength by ppGpp.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11181-11189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), with measured enzyme activity similarly converted to Miller units to account for any variance in culture density or reaction times. Previous work identified Cys79 of LasR, the sole cysteine within the LasR ligand binding domain (Fig. 1), as sensitive to oxidative stress in a proteome-wide screen of P. aeruginosa (15Deng X. Weerapana E. Ulanovskaya O. Sun F. Liang H. Ji Q. Ye Y. Fu Y. Zhou L. Li J. Zhang H. Wang C. Alvarez S. Hicks L.M. Lan L. Wu M. Cravatt B.F. He C.

This report provided evidence that LasR activity is impacted by oxidative stress, particularly in cell-based assays, but did not delineate the underlying protein chemistry of this redox response. We were interested in probing this biochemical mechanism further and learning the specifics of how LasR function may span both quorum-sensing and redox-sensing pathways. To take a close look at Cys79, we expressed and purified the LasR LBD (amino acids 1–173) in the presence of its native autoinducer, 3O-C12-HSL, yielding soluble protein. Although there are numerous possible outcomes for the reaction of a thiol such as Cys79 with an oxidizing agent, one conceivable oxidative stress response mechanism is the formation of a disulfide bond between two reactive thiols, here the linking of two Cys79 residues. Interestingly, we saw evidence of some dimeric LBD when the protein was purified under non-reducing conditions and evaluated on a denaturing, non-reducing SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 2A). This result suggests a disulfide bond between monomers. Dimer formation was promoted in the presence of oxidants such as H2O2 and cumene hydroperoxide but reversed in the presence of the reducing agent DTT. Additionally, mutagenesis of Cys79 to serine (LBD C79S) confirmed that Cys79 was required for formation of the observed covalent dimer. These results led us to probe this dimer further to determine its importance for oxidative sensing by LasR. Because the two Cys79 in the known dimeric, autoinducer-bound LBD crystal structures (22Bottomley M.J. Muraglia E. Bazzo R. Carfì A.

Such a structural change, though, could impact the ability of LasR to activate transcription.FIGURE 2.Impact of oxidative stress and unnatural ligands on LasR LBD.

Although near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a simple and non-invasive method for characterizing the clinical features of various psychiatric illnesses, few studies have used NIRS to directly investigate the association between prefrontal cortical activity and inhibitory control in patients with methamphetamine-induced psychosis (MAP). Using a 24-channel NIRS system, we compared hemodynamic responses during the Stroop color-word task in 14 patients with MAP and 21 healthy controls matched for age, sex and premorbid IQ. In addition, we used the Barrett Impulsivity Scale-11 (BIS-11) to assess impulsivity between subject groups. The MAP group exhibited significantly less activation in the anterior and frontopolar prefrontal cortex accompanied by lower Stroop color-word task performance, compared with controls. Moreover, BIS-11 scores were significantly higher in the MAP group, and were negatively correlated with the hemodynamic responses in prefrontal cortex. Our data suggest that reduced hemodynamic responses in the prefrontal cortex might reflect higher levels of impulsivity in patients with MAP, providing new insights into disrupted inhibitory control observed in MAP."

PGs are fatty acid mediators involved in cartilage homeostasis, however the action of their synthesizing COX-enzymes in cartilage differentiation is not well understood. In this study we hypothesized that COX-1 and COX-2 have differential roles in chondrogenic differentiation.ATDC5 cells were differentiated in the presence of COX-1 (SC-560, Mofezolac) or COX-2 (NS398, Celecoxib) specific inhibitors. Specificity of the NSAIDs and inhibition of specific prostaglandin levels were determined by EIA. Prostaglandins were added during the differentiation process. Chondrogenic outcome was determined by gene- and protein expression analyses.Inhibition of COX-1 prevented Col2a1 and Col10a1 expression. Inhibition of COX-2 resulted in decreased Col10a1 expression, while Col2a1 remained unaffected. To explain this difference expression patterns of both COX-enzymes as well as specific prostaglandin concentrations were determined. Both COX-enzymes are upregulated during late chondrogenic differentiation, whereas only COX-2 is briefly expressed also early in differentiation. PGD2 and PGE2 followed the COX-2 expression pattern, whereas PGF2α and TXA2 levels remained low. Furthermore, COX inhibition resulted in decreased levels of all tested PGs, except for PGD2 and PGF2α in the COX-1 inhibited condition. Addition of PGE2 and PGF2α resulted in increased expression of chondrogenic markers, whereas TXA2 increased expression of hypertrophic markers.Our findings point towards a differential role for COX-enzymes and PG-production in chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells. Ongoing research is focusing on further elucidating the functional partition of cyclooxygenases and specific prostaglandin production."

Also, LPA stimulation induces these events in an early time course, suggesting that LPA mediates TNF-α signaling in an autocrine manner. Moreover, PLC∈ knockdown results in inhibition of phosphorylation of IκB by ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) but not by IκB kinases.

PLC∈ is expressed in non-immune cells, such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts of various tissues, but not in immune cells, such as lymphocytes, granulocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells (8Hu L.

By employing genetically modified mice for PLC∈, we demonstrated that PLC∈ plays a crucial role in inflammation in various tissues; mice homozygous for an allele devoid of the lipase activity (PLC∈ΔX/ΔX mice) exhibited markedly attenuated inflammatory responses in various animal models, including the phorbol ester-induced dermatitis, contact dermatitis, and bronchial asthma models (8Hu L.

Immunol. 2011; 41: 202-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Concurrently, PLC∈ΔX/ΔX mice exhibited marked resistance to tumor formation in the two-stage skin chemical carcinogenesis using a phorbol ester as a promoter as well as to the de novo intestinal carcinogenesis on the ApcMin/+ (adenomatous polyposis coli) background, which were associated with attenuation of tumor-associated inflammation exemplified by reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines (13Bai Y. Edamatsu H. Maeda S. Saito H. Suzuki N. Satoh T. Kataoka T.

Phospholipase C∈ promotes intestinal tumorigenesis of ApcMin/+ mice through augmentation of inflammation and angiogenesis.Carcinogenesis. 2009; 30: 1424-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These findings suggested that PLC∈ plays a role in tumor promotion through augmentation of inflammatory responses. Recently, strong support for the crucial role of PLC∈ in human carcinogenesis came from genome-wide association studies, which identified PLC∈ (PLCE1) as a predisposing gene for gastric and esophageal carcinomas (15Abnet C.C.

However, the direct link between the proinflammatory and tumor-promoting functions of PLC∈ awaits further verification by using an animal model of inflammation-induced carcinogenesis. Recent studies indicated that PLC∈ activation augments the NF-κB-dependent expression of inflammation-associated genes, particularly those of proinflammatory cytokines in cultured cells (17Harada Y. Edamatsu H. Kataoka T. PLC∈ cooperates with the NF-κB pathway to augment TNFα-stimulated CCL2/MCP1 expression in human keratinocyte.Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition, it was reported that PKD, a serine/threonine kinase also called atypical PKCμ, which had been known to mediate NF-κB activation triggered by various stimuli, such as LPA (19Chiu T.T.

NF-κB binds as a dimer of p65 RelA and p50 to a consensus DNA sequence on the promoters and enhancers of the target genes and regulates their transcription. NF-κB activation is tightly controlled by several factors. Under a resting condition, NF-κB is associated with IκB and exists as an inactive form in the cytoplasm. Upon stimulation by extracellular ligands, such as TNF-α, IκB is phosphorylated by IκB kinases at its specific serine residues, including Ser-32, and targeted for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome degradation, thereby allowing NF-κB to undergo nuclear translocation and activate the target gene expression (23Wullaert A. Bonnet M.C. Pasparakis M. NF-κB in the regulation of epithelial homeostasis and inflammation.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 146-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 24Pasparakis M. Role of NF-κB in epithelial biology.Immunol. Rev. 2012; 246: 346-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). There are several proteins functioning as IκB kinases, such as IKK complex, consisting of IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (25Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M.

Pennington K.N. Trushin S.A. Asin S. Paya C.V. Serine 32 and serine 36 of IκBα are directly phosphorylated by protein kinase CKII in vitro.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 839-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). RSK family proteins are serine/threonine kinases and activated through phosphorylation by ERK1/2 and PDK1 (phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1) in the cytoplasm. Thr-573 of RSK, located in the activation loop of the C-terminal kinase domain, is phosphorylated by ERK, leading to autophosphorylation of Ser-380 in the linker region (29Anjum R. Blenis J. The RSK family of kinases: emerging roles in cellular signalling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 747-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Subsequently, RSK is fully activated through phosphorylation by PDK1. Activated RSK is located in both the cytoplasm and nuclei and phosphorylates its substrates, such as IκB (26Schouten G.J.

Coupling of the RAS-MAPK pathway to gene activation by RSK2, a growth factor-regulated CREB kinase.Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar) in the nuclei. The subcellular localization of RSK is reported to be regulated by a scaffold protein, PEA15 (phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15), which directly associates with RSK and holds it in the cytoplasm, based on the observation that overexpression of PEA15 prevented nuclear translocation of RSK (32Vaidyanathan H. Ramos J.W. RSK2 activity is regulated by its interaction with PEA-15.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32367-32372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of a phosphorylation-mimicking mutant, S104D, of PEA15 failed to elevate the CREB promoter activity, suggesting that the phosphorylation of PEA15 might regulate the RSK localization (33Vaidyanathan H. Opoku-Ansah J. Pastorino S. Renganathan H. Matter M.L. Ramos J.W. ERK MAP kinase is targeted to RSK2 by the phosphoprotein PEA-15.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

In this study, we further investigate the relationship between the proinflammatory and tumor-promoting functions of PLC∈ by employing the colitis-induced colorectal carcinogenesis model. Further, we analyze the molecular mechanism by which PLC∈ augments the NF-κB-dependent expression of inflammation-associated genes, demonstrating that the PLC∈-PKD axis, activated by LPA receptor engagement, augments NF-κB activation by causing sustained cytoplasmic localization of RSK via phosphorylation of PEA15 and thereby facilitating its phosphorylation of IκB in the cytoplasm.

Cells were washed with PBS and serum-starved for 3 h before subjecting to various experiments. Cells were pretreated with inhibitors and antagonists before stimulation by ligands, such as TNF-α and LPA. Caco2 cells (8 × 106 cells) were transfected with Stealth siRNA (Life Technologies, Inc.) targeting PLC∈ (HSS181915, siRNA 1) or its control (12935-400) by electroporation using GenePulser (Bio-Rad) as described before (8Hu L.

Transfection of plasmids into Caco2 cells was performed by using Lipofectamine3000 (Life Technologies). 14–16 h after transfection, cells were subjected to various experiments after exchange to fresh medium. Subcellular fractionation was carried out as described (36Zhang L. Li N. Caicedo R. Neu J.

Cells were lysed in a lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor mixture). The lysates were centrifuged at 21,500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were used for immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Immunoblotting was performed by the standard procedure followed by acquisition of immunoreactive signals on the blots using ImageQuant LAS4000mini (GE Healthcare). The intensities of the immunoreactive signals were quantitated using ImageQuant TL (GE Healthcare). Total cellular RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR were performed as described previously (37Tadano M. Edamatsu H. Minamisawa S. Yokoyama U. Ishikawa Y. Suzuki N. Saito H. Wu D.

https://openalex.org/W2313397377,"Background Ventilator-associated conditions (VACs), for which new surveillance definitions and methods were issued by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), are respiratory complications occurring in conjunction with the use of invasive mechanical ventilation and are related to adverse outcomes in critically ill patients. However, to date, risk factors for VACs have not been adequately established, leading to a need for developing a better understanding of the risks. The objective of this study was to explore care-related risk factors as a process indicator and provide valuable information pertaining to VAC preventive measures. Methods This retrospective, single-center, cohort study was conducted in the intensive-care unit (ICU) of a university hospital in Japan. Patient data were automatically sampled using a computerized medical records system and retrospectively analyzed. Management and care-related, but not host-related, factors were exhaustively analyzed using multivariate analysis for risks of VACs. VAC correlation to mortality was also investigated. Results Of the 3122 patients admitted in the ICU, 303 ventilated patients meeting CDC-specified eligibility criteria were included in the analysis. Thirty-seven VACs (12.2%) were found with a corresponding rate of 12.1 per 1000 ventilator days. Multivariate analysis revealed four variables related to patient care as risk factors for VACs: absence of intensivist participation in management of ventilated patients [adjusted HR (AHR): 7.325, P < 0.001)], using relatively higher driving pressure (AHR: 1.216, P < 0.001), development of edema (AHR: 2.145, P = 0.037), and a larger body weight increase (AHR: 0.058, P = 0.005). Furthermore, this research confirmed mortality differences in patients with VACs and statistically derived risks compared with those without VACs (HR: 2.623, P = 0.008). Conclusion Four risk factors related to patient care were clearly identified to be the key factors for VAC preventive measures."
https://openalex.org/W2334678677,"Monitoring disparities in secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is important for tailoring smoke-free policies to the needs of different groups. We examined disparity and trends in SHS exposure among both nonsmokers and smokers at Japanese workplaces between 2002 and 2012.A total of 32,940 employees in nationally representative, population-based, repeated cross-sectional surveys in 2002, 2007 and 2012 in Japan was analyzed. Adjusted rate ratios for workplace SHS exposure from other people (""everyday"" and ""everyday or sometimes"") were calculated according to covariates, using log-binomial regression models with survey weights. In this survey, employees who do not smoke at workplace are defined as workplace-nonsmokers; and those smoke at workplace are used as workplace-smokers. SHS exposure for smokers does not involve their own SHS.While everyday SHS exposure prevalence in workplace-nonsmokers decreased markedly (33.2% to 11.4%), that in workplace-smokers decreased only slightly (63.3% to 55.6%). Workplace-smokers were significantly more likely to report everyday SHS exposure than workplace-nonsmokers, and the degree of association increased over time: compared with the nonsmokers (reference), covariates-adjusted rate ratio (95% confidence interval) for the smokers increased from 1.70 (1.62-1.77) in 2002 to 4.16 (3.79-4.56) in 2012. Similar results were observed for everyday or sometimes SHS exposure. Compared with complete workplace smoking bans, partial and no bans were consistently and significantly associated with high SHS exposure among both nonsmokers and smokers. We also observed disparities in SHS exposure by employee characteristics, such as age group and worksite scale.Although overall SHS exposure decreased among Japanese employees between 2002 and 2012, the SHS exposure disparity between nonsmokers and smokers widened. Because smokers reported more frequent SHS exposure than nonsmokers, subsequent mortality due to SHS exposure may be higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. This information may be useful for advocating workplace smoke-free policies."
https://openalex.org/W2317627052,"Interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5) has been called a “master switch” for its ability to determine whether cells mount proinflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses. Accordingly, IRF5 should be an attractive target for therapeutic drug development. Here we report on the development of a novel decoy peptide inhibitor of IRF5 that decreases myocardial inflammation and improves vascular endothelial cell (EC) function in tight-skin (Tsk/+) mice. Biolayer interferometry studies showed the Kd of IRF5D for recombinant IRF5 to be 3.72 ± 0.74x10-6M. Increasing concentrations of IRF5D (0–100 μg/mL, 24h) had no significant effect on EC proliferation or apoptosis. Treatment of Tsk/+ mice with IRF5D (1mg/kg/d subcutaneously, 21d) reduced IRF5 and ICAM-1 expression and monocyte/macrophage and neutrophil counts in Tsk/+ hearts compared to expression in hearts from PBS-treated Tsk/+ mice (p<0.05). EC-dependent vasodilatation of facialis arteries isolated from PBS-treated Tsk/+ mice was reduced (~15%). IRF5D treatments (1mg/kg/d, 21d) improved vasodilatation in arteries isolated from Tsk/+ mice nearly 3-fold (~45%, p<0.05), representing nearly 83% of the vasodilatation in arteries isolated from C57Bl/6J mice (~55%). IRF5D (50μg/mL, 24h) reduced nuclear translocation of IRF5 in myocytes cultured on both Tsk/+ cardiac matrix and C57Bl/6J cardiac matrix (p<0.05). These data suggest that IRF5 plays a causal role in inflammation, fibrosis and impaired vascular EC function in Tsk/+ mice and that treatment with IRF5D effectively counters IRF5-dependent mechanisms of inflammation and fibrosis in the myocardium in these mice."
https://openalex.org/W2334683332,"Abstract l-Dopachrome tautomerase (l-DCT), also called tyrosinase-related protein-2 (TRP-2), is a melanoma antigen overexpressed in most chemo-/radiotherapeutic stress-resistant tumor clones, and caveolin-1 (CAV1) is a main regulator of numerous signaling processes. A structural and functional relationship between DCT and CAV1 is first presented here in two human amelanotic melanoma cell lines, derived from vertical growth phase (MelJuSo) and metastatic (SKMel28) melanomas. DCT co-localizes at the plasma membrane with CAV1 and Cavin-1, another molecular marker for caveolae in both cell phenotypes. Our novel structural model proposed for the DCT-CAV1 complex, in addition to co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry data, indicates a possible direct interaction between DCT and CAV1. The CAV1 control on DCT gene expression, DCT post-translational processing, and subcellular distribution is cell phenotype-dependent. DCT is a modulator of CAV1 stability and supramolecular assembly in both cell phenotypes. During autocrine stimulation, the expressions of DCT and CAV1 are oppositely regulated; DCT increases while CAV1 decreases. Sub-confluent MelJuSo clones DCThigh/CAV1low are proliferating and acquire fibroblast-like morphology, forming massive, confluent clusters as demonstrated by immunofluorescent staining and TissueFAXS quantitative image cytometry analysis. CAV1 down-regulation directly contributes to the expansion of MelJuSo DCThigh subtype. CAV1 involved in the perpetuation of cell phenotype-overexpressing anti-stress DCT molecule supports the concept that CAV1 functions as a tumor suppressor in early stages of melanoma. DCT is a regulator of the CAV1-associated structures and is possibly a new molecular player in CAV1-mediated processes in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W2319483571,"Purpose To investigate the dose variation between follow-up CT examinations, when a patient is examined several times on the same scanner with the identical scan protocol which comprised automated exposure control. Material and Methods This retrospective study was approved by the local ethics committee. The volume computed tomography dose index (CTDIvol) and the dose-length-product (DLP) were recorded for 60 cancer patients (29 male, 31 female, mean age 60.1 years), who received 3 follow-up CT examinations each composed of a non-enhanced scan of the liver (LI-CT) and a contrast-enhanced scan of chest (CH-CT) and abdomen (AB-CT). Each examination was performed on the same scanner (Siemens Definition FLASH) equipped with automated exposure control (CARE Dose 4D and CARE KV) using the identical scan protocol. Results The median percentage difference in DLP between follow-up examinations was 9.6% for CH-CT, 10.3% for LI-CT, and 10.1% for AB-CT; the median percentage difference in CTDIvol 8.3% for CH-CT, 7.4% for LI-CT and 7.7% for AB-CT (p<0.0001 for all values). The maximum difference in DLP between follow-up examinations was 67.5% for CH-CT, 50.8% for LI-CT and 74.3% for AB-CT; the maximum difference in CTDIvol 62.9% for CH-CT, 47.2% for LI-CT, and 49% for AB-CT. Conclusion A significant variance in the radiation dose occurs between follow-up CT examinations when the same CT scanner and the identical imaging protocol are used in combination with automated exposure control."
https://openalex.org/W2324244665,"Synthetic DNA has great propensity for efficiently and stably storing non-biological information. With DNA writing and reading technologies rapidly advancing, new applications for synthetic DNA are emerging in data storage and communication. Traditionally, DNA communication has focused on the encoding and transfer of complete sets of information. Here, we explore the use of DNA for the communication of short messages that are fragmented across multiple distinct DNA molecules. We identified three pivotal points in a communication-data encoding, data transfer & data extraction-and developed novel tools to enable communication via molecules of DNA. To address data encoding, we designed DNA-based individualized keyboards (iKeys) to convert plaintext into DNA, while reducing the occurrence of DNA homopolymers to improve synthesis and sequencing processes. To address data transfer, we implemented a secret-sharing system-Multiplexed Sequence Encoding (MuSE)-that conceals messages between multiple distinct DNA molecules, requiring a combination key to reveal messages. To address data extraction, we achieved the first instance of chromatogram patterning through multiplexed sequencing, thereby enabling a new method for data extraction. We envision these approaches will enable more widespread communication of information via DNA."

Previously, we found a beneficial effect of intramyocardial injection of unstimulated human MSCs (uMSCs) on cardiac function after permanent coronary artery ligation. In the present study we aimed to extend this research by investigating the effect of intramyocardial injection of human MSCs pre-stimulated with the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (iMSCs), since pro-inflammatory priming has shown additional salutary effects in multiple experimental disease models.MI was induced in NOD/Scid mice by permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Animals received intramyocardial injection of uMSCs, iMSCs or PBS. Sham-operated animals were used to determine baseline characteristics. Cardiac performance was assessed after 2 and 14 days using 7-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and pressure-volume loop measurements. Histology and q-PCR were used to confirm MSC engraftment in the heart.Both uMSC and iMSC therapy had no significant beneficial effect on cardiac function or remodelling in contrast to our previous studies.Animal models for cardiac MSC therapy appear less robust than initially envisioned."

The chaperone-like activity of the R2TP complex has been implicated in the assembly of multiple protein complexes, such as the small nucleolar RNA protein complex. However, the mechanism of the R2TP complex activity in vivo and the assembly of the complex itself are still largely unknown. Pih1 is an unstable protein and tends to aggregate when expressed alone. The C-terminal fragment of Pih1 contains multiple destabilization factors and acts as a degron when fused to other proteins. In this study, we investigated Pih1 interactors and identified a specific interaction between Pih1 and the proteasome subunit Rpn8 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae when HSP90 co-chaperone Tah1 is depleted. By analyzing truncation mutants, we identified that the C-terminal 30 amino acids of Rpn8 are sufficient for the binding to Pih1 C terminus. With in vitro and in vivo degradation assays, we showed that the Pih1 C-terminal fragment Pih1(282–344) is able to induce a ubiquitin-independent degradation of GFP.

Intrinsically disordered regions are important features of a protein, and they often mediate protein-protein interaction or are involved in posttranslational regulation of the protein activities (25Mészáros B. Simon I. Dosztányi Z. The expanding view of protein-protein interactions: complexes involving intrinsically disordered proteins.Phys. Biol. 2011; 8 (035003)Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Additionally, we previously showed that the Pih1 extreme C-terminal fragment, Pih1(282–344), contains multiple destabilization elements sufficient to induce fast degradation of well folded proteins, such as GFP, in vivo (8Paci A. Liu X.H. Huang H. Lim A. Houry W.A. Zhao R. The stability of the small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) assembly protein Pih1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is modulated by its C terminus.J. Biol.

Therefore, Pih1 is a multidomain scaffold protein responsible for binding different interacting partners, whereas the stability and turnover of Pih1 in vivo is probably controlled by a complex mechanism. In this study, we further investigated the role of the Pih1 C-terminal fragment in the assembly of R2TP complex and identified the proteasome lid subunit Rpn8 as a Pih1 interacting partner. By in depth analysis of protein interactions using both in vivo and in vitro pull-down assays, we discovered a specific interaction between Pih1 and Rpn8 mediated by their C-terminal fragments. Tah1 and Rpn8 exclusively bind to the Pih1 C terminus. We also showed that the association of Pih1 to Rpn8 leads to proteasomal degradation of Pih1 in a ubiquitin-independent manner. Our study therefore not only provides mechanistic insights into the Pih1 cellular proteostasis but also reveals a novel binding site on the 26S proteasome that mediates ubiquitin-independent degradation of Pih1. The plasmid pET22b-UB4DHFR-CytB-His6 was constructed by amplifying the fusion protein coding sequence from pGEM3Z-UB4DHFR-Cytb-His6 (26Prakash S. Inobe T. Hatch A.J. Matouschek A. Substrate selection by the proteasome during degradation of protein complexes.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2009; 5: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and insertion into the NdeI/HindIII sites of pET22b. To construct the plasmid expressing DHFR-CytB-His6, the DHFR-CytB-His6 coding sequence in pET22b-UB4DHFR-CytB-His6 was cleaved with NcoI and HindIII and inserted into pProEXHTb. The plasmids expressing GFP-Pih1(231–344) and GFP-Pih1(282–344) in E. coli and yeast were described previously (8Paci A. Liu X.H. Huang H. Lim A. Houry W.A. Zhao R.

GFP-Pih1(282–344ΔK) expressed from p415GPD vector was constructed by replacing the Pih1(282–344) coding sequencing (EcoRI/HindIII) with a new EcoRI/HindIII fragment that was synthesized as oligonucleotides and annealed together, in which the codons for lysine were replaced by arginine codons. Plasmid p415GPD-Ub-Arg-DHFRts, which expresses the ubiquitin-dependent model substrate DHFRts, was generated by amplifying Ub-Arg-DHFRts from pRS315-Kan-Ura3Pro-Ub-Arg-DHFRts (a kind gift of Dr. Charlie Boone, University of Toronto) and inserting the fragment between the XbaI and HindIII sites of p415GPD. To construct GST fusion proteins for the Rpn8 C-terminal fragments, the Rpn8(291–338) and Rpn8(309–338) coding sequences were amplified and cloned into the NcoI/BamHI sites of pETM30 vector. The GST protein alone was expressed and purified from plasmid pGEX2TK. NusA-His6-Pih1 fusion protein construct was made by cloning the Pih1 coding sequence into the NcoI/BamHI sites of pETM60. The construction of plasmids p414GPD-Tah1 and p414GPD-Pih1 was described previously (2Zhao R. Kakihara Y. Gribun A. Huen J. Yang G. Khanna M. Costanzo M. Brost R.L. Boone C. Hughes T.R. Yip C.M.

https://openalex.org/W2316519816,"We previously reported a method to expand human monocytes through lentivirus-mediated introduction of cMYC and BMI1, and we named the monocyte-derived proliferating cells, CD14-ML. CD14-ML differentiated into functional DC (CD14-ML-DC) upon addition of IL-4, resulting in the generation of a large number of DC. One drawback of this method was the extensive donor-dependent variation in proliferation efficiency. In the current study, we found that introduction of BCL2 or LYL1 along with cMYC and BMI1 was beneficial. Using the improved method, we obtained CD14-ML from all samples, regardless of whether the donors were healthy individuals or cancer patients. In vitro stimulation of peripheral blood T cells with CD14-ML-DC that were loaded with cancer antigen-derived peptides led to the establishment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell lines that recognized the peptides. Since CD14-ML was propagated for more than 1 month, we could readily conduct genetic modification experiments. To generate CD14-ML-DC that expressed antigenic proteins, we introduced lentiviral antigen-expression vectors and subjected the cells to 2 weeks of culture for drug-selection and expansion. The resulting antigen-expressing CD14-ML-DC successfully induced CD8+ T cell lines that were reactive to CMVpp65 or MART1/MelanA, suggesting an application in vaccination therapy. Thus, this improved method enables the generation of a sufficient number of DC for vaccination therapy from a small amount of peripheral blood from cancer patients. Information on T cell epitopes is not necessary in vaccination with cancer antigen-expressing CD14-ML-DC; therefore, all patients, irrespective of HLA type, will benefit from anti-cancer therapy based on this technology."

A better understanding of spatial heterogeneity in the risk of drug-resistance may help to prioritize local responses.Between July 2012 and June 2013, we conducted a two-way Lot Quality Assurance Sampling (LQAS) study to classify the burden of rifampicin (RIF)-resistant TB among incident TB cases notified within the catchment areas of seven laboratories in two northern and one southern district of KZN. Decision rules for classification of areas as having either a high- or low-risk of RIF resistant TB (based on proportion of RIF resistance among all TB cases) were based on consultation with local policy makers.We classified five areas as high-risk and two as low-risk. High-risk areas were identified in both Southern and Northern districts, with the greatest proportion of RIF resistance observed in the northernmost area, the Manguzi community situated on the Mozambique border.Our study revealed heterogeneity in the risk of RIF resistant disease among incident TB cases in KZN. This study demonstrates the potential for LQAS to detect geographic heterogeneity in areas where access to drug susceptibility testing is limited."

https://openalex.org/W2317094889,"Background When profiling hospital performance, quality inicators are commonly evaluated through hospital-specific adjusted means with confidence intervals. When identifying deviations from a norm, large hospitals can have statistically significant results even for clinically irrelevant deviations while important deviations in small hospitals can remain undiscovered. We have used data from the Swedish Stroke Register (Riksstroke) to illustrate the properties of a benchmarking method that integrates considerations of both clinical relevance and level of statistical significance. Methods The performance measure used was case-mix adjusted risk of death or dependency in activities of daily living within 3 months after stroke. A hospital was labeled as having outlying performance if its case-mix adjusted risk exceeded a benchmark value with a specified statistical confidence level. The benchmark was expressed relative to the population risk and should reflect the clinically relevant deviation that is to be detected. A simulation study based on Riksstroke patient data from 2008–2009 was performed to investigate the effect of the choice of the statistical confidence level and benchmark value on the diagnostic properties of the method. Results Simulations were based on 18,309 patients in 76 hospitals. The widely used setting, comparing 95% confidence intervals to the national average, resulted in low sensitivity (0.252) and high specificity (0.991). There were large variations in sensitivity and specificity for different requirements of statistical confidence. Lowering statistical confidence improved sensitivity with a relatively smaller loss of specificity. Variations due to different benchmark values were smaller, especially for sensitivity. This allows the choice of a clinically relevant benchmark to be driven by clinical factors without major concerns about sufficiently reliable evidence. Conclusions The study emphasizes the importance of combining clinical relevance and level of statistical confidence when profiling hospital performance. To guide the decision process a web-based tool that gives ROC-curves for different scenarios is provided."
