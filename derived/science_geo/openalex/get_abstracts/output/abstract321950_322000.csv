https://openalex.org/W2040053099,"Reactions between nitrogen and water in the air surrounding lightning discharges can provide an important source of nitric oxide even under conditions where oxygen is a minor atmospheric constituent. Estimates are given for the associated source of soluble nitrite and nitrate. It is shown that lightning and subsequent atmospheric chemistry can provide a source of nitrate for the primitive ocean as large as 106 tons of nitrogen per year, sufficient to fill the ocean to its present level of nitrate in less than 10(6) years."

The feature resolution is approximately 500 kilometers, revealing a huge anomaly associated with Olympus Mons, a mascon in Isidis Planitia, and other anomalies correlated with volcanic structure. Olympus Mons has been modeled with a 600-kilometer surface disk having a mass of 8.7 × 1021 grams"

The refractive index of the high-pressure phase increases sharply with pressure, indicating a density increase of similar magnitude. At 360 kilobars the calculated density of the high-pressure phase is 0.6 to 0.7 grams per cubic centimeter."

Such trace metals cycle in the salt marsh by net import on the surface microlayer and net export in the dissolved and seston components during maximum monthly tides."
https://openalex.org/W1963583428,"Traps of the carnivorous hydrophyte Utricularia vulgaris Linnaeus (Lentibulariaceae) have structures termed antennae and bristles around their trapdoors that increase their rate of entrapment of the substrate-dwelling prey Chydorus sphaericus (Chydoridae, Crustacea). The kind and number of these structures are important in determining capture rate. Experimental data and corresponding behavioral observations support Darwin's hypothesis that antennae and bristles function as a ""funnel"" leading potential prey toward the trapdoor and their capture by offering the prey a favorable substrate that exploits their natural locomotor and feeding behavior."
https://openalex.org/W1916565667,"Accurate reconstructions of past climatic conditions on Earth are important for modeling future climate change. Researchers use climate ""proxies"" from deep-sea sediments, corals, or ice cores to reconstruct these past climatic conditions, but as Nürnberg explains in this Perspective, different techniques often give different answers. A relatively new technique, Mg/Ca paleothermometry, is a particularly promising tool, especially in conjunction with oxygen isotope measurements on the same planktonic foraminiferal specimens. The power of this method is exemplified by the study by Lea et al."
https://openalex.org/W1540524412,Post-cold war investment in science--particularly in the case of seasonal to interannual climate forecasting--is increasingly justified by the goal of demonstrating explicit societal benefit. A review of the 2000 food crisis in Ethiopia and the state of the science of seasonal forecasting is sobering and underscores the need to foster more realistic expectations among both policy-makers and scientists about the uses and limits of climate forecasts in alleviating complex social problems.

A few years ago, many of the same scientists poured their energy into the Global Biodiversity Assessment. But that exercise sank without a trace after participants failed to find a receptive audience."
https://openalex.org/W1544848136,"In 1907, Albert Einstein studied the heat capacity of diamond to gain insight into the quantization of vibrations in solids. Hone et al. have now measured the heat capacity of another carbon compound, carbon nanotubes, to determine the dimensionality of their vibrations as a function of temperature. In his Perspective, de Heer compares the two studies, and concludes that carbon continues to provide new fundamental insights into the properties of condensed matter."

Although some experts say the findings raise concern about a threat to human health, others decry the media frenzy and contend that the new research adds little to what is known about the mysterious, fatal diseases."

this beautiful and well-appointed laboratory,
I wish first to express on behalf of my colleagues
and myself the appreciation and gratitude
which we feel because of the opportunity
which you, Mr. Fleming, and you, Dr. Bridge,
have jointly opened up to us, not only of devoting
ourselves to the intensive pursuit of the
science which we love, but also of assisting in
the solution of the fascinating and vitally important
problems which the extraordinary developments
in physics during the past two decades
have pushed to the forefront of the
world's needs to-day."

The evidence, reported in this week's issue of Nature, takes the form of a dried chunk of human excrement, or coprolite, containing a telltale human protein that could have gotten there only by being ingested."
https://openalex.org/W2422151551,"The recent technical objections to the U.S. National Missile Defense system by a study group of the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) ([1][1]) (ScienceScope, “Hit or missile?”, 14 Apr., p. [243][2]) and by several independent researchers (News Focus, “Researchers target flaws in ballistic missile defense plan” by D. Malakoff and A. Cho, 16 June, p. 1940) are missing the point: The planned system will not operate just on its own, but will rely for warhead/decoy discrimination on information supplied by a number of complementary systems and use the interceptor's on-board sensors mainly for homing on a designated target. It is critical to discuss these complementary systems as well, not just the limited discrimination capability of the system under consideration for approval by President Bill Clinton this fall.

Four major passive or active discrimination techniques—radar and infrared detectors, and laser and particle beams—were evaluated in a report from the American Physical Society (APS) study group on the status of the science and technology of directed energy weapons ([2][3]). According to the APS study, the best potential for discrimination is offered by interactive high-energy beam techniques, techniques that are not even mentioned in the UCS report. In this area, one of the most important advances in the past 10 years has been the development of superlasers ([3][4], [4][5]); that is, the invention of “chirped pulse amplification,” which increases the instantaneous power of lasers by a factor of 1 million. Such power enables tabletop lasers to produce nuclear reactions directly ([4][5]) (see also Science , 2 Apr. 1999, p. [35][6]). Superlaser beams combine the ease in steering and focusing of optical laser beams with the capacity of particle beams to generate high-energy secondary particles in distant targets, which gives them the ability to “x-ray” remote objects and discriminate as to whether they are warheads or decoys.

The political implications of ballistic missile defense are of such a magnitude that it is important that any technical assessment should be as accurate and comprehensive as possible—including a serious evaluation of the prospect of all existing and emerging warhead/decoy discrimination techniques.

https://openalex.org/W1929974949,"New findings described on page 1754 offer the strongest evidence yet that certain cells can be steered onto new career paths even after they've become committed to a particular job. In the current work, researchers managed to coax rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells, which scientists thought were irreversibly committed to becoming neuronal handmaidens called oligodendrocytes or astrocytes, into becoming neurons. Because they ran several experiments to test the purity of their well-characterized cells, they say it is unlikely that the effect was due to undetected immature cells."

Now from South Africa comes evidence that the Permian-Triassic extinction of land plants was equally brutal and swift. In a paper on page 1740 of this issue of Science, researchers report that rocks that started as sediments laid down in South Africa's Karoo Basin 250 million years ago tell of an abrupt switch in style of sedimentation, as if the land had been permanently stripped of the rooted plants that held it in place. But in the absence of any trace of an impact, researchers are groping for an equally far-reaching explanation."
