https://openalex.org/W2808812465,"Fluorescent reporters are commonly used to quantify activities or properties of both natural and engineered cells. Fluorescence is still typically reported only in arbitrary or normalized units, however, rather than in units defined using an independent calibrant, which is problematic for scientific reproducibility and even more so when it comes to effective engineering. In this paper, we report an interlaboratory study showing that simple, low-cost unit calibration protocols can remedy this situation, producing comparable units and dramatic improvements in precision over both arbitrary and normalized units. Participants at 92 institutions around the world measured fluorescence from E. coli transformed with three engineered test plasmids, plus positive and negative controls, using simple, low-cost unit calibration protocols designed for use with a plate reader and/or flow cytometer. In addition to providing comparable units, use of an independent calibrant allows quantitative use of positive and negative controls to identify likely instances of protocol failure. The use of independent calibrants thus allows order of magnitude improvements in precision, narrowing the 95% confidence interval of measurements in our study up to 600-fold compared to normalized units."
https://openalex.org/W2809548842,"Microbial drinking water quality can be altered in large buildings, especially after stagnation. In this study, bacterial profiles were generated according to the stagnation time and the volume of water collected at the tap. Successive volumes of cold and hot water were sampled after controlled stagnation periods. Bacterial profiles revealed an important decline (> 2 log) in culturable cells in the first 500 mL sampled from the hot and cold water systems, with a steep decline in the first 15 mL. The strong exponential correlation (R2 ≥ 0.97) between the culturable cell counts in water and the pipe surface-to-volume ratio suggests the biofilm as the main contributor to the rapid increase in suspended culturable cells measured after a short stagnation of one-hour. Results evidence the contribution of the high surface-to-volume ratio at the point of use and the impact of short stagnation times on the increased bacterial load observed. Simple faucets with minimal internal surface area should be preferred to minimize surface area. Sampling protocol, including sampling volume and prior stagnation, was also shown to impact the resulting culturable cell concentration by more than 1000-fold. Sampling a smaller volume on first draw after stagnation will help maximize recovery of bacteria."

Although risk of transmission is high, data on vector population characteristics are scanty in Bangladesh; therefore, a comprehensive prediction of the patterns of local virus transmission is not possible. Recognizing these gaps, multi-year entomological surveys were carried out in Dhaka, where the disease is most frequently reported. The specific objectives of the present study are threefold: i) to determine the risk factors for the presence of Aedes mosquitoes; ii) to identify the types of most productive and key containers; and iii) to estimate the effects of climatic factors on Aedes abundance in the city of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Entomological surveys were conducted in 12 out of 90 wards in Dhaka. These wards were selected using a probability proportional sampling procedure during the monsoon seasons in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and in the dry season in 2012. All containers inside and around sampled households were inspected for mosquito larvae and pupae, and containers were classified according to their relative size, use pattern, and materials of construction. During the study period (2011-2013), 12,680 larvae and pupae were collected. About 82% of the identified immature mosquitoes were Aedes aegypti, while the remainder were Ae. albopictus and other mosquito species. The largest number of immature mosquitoes was collected from tires and refrigerator trays during 2011 and 2012 monsoon seasons. Conversely, plastic drums were the most productive during the 2012 dry and 2013 monsoon season. Vehicle parts and discarded construction materials were the most efficient producers of Aedes mosquitoes in all surveys. The presence of Aedes mosquitoes was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in low socio-economic zones of Dhaka. Container location, presence of vegetation, and availability of shade for containers were also significantly associated with finding immature Aedes mosquitoes, based on multivariable analysis after confounder adjustment. Rainfall, temperature, and relative humidity also significantly affected the mean abundance of mosquitoes. Proper use, disposal, and recycling of the containers that effectively produce large numbers of Aedes vector mosquitoes may decrease the risk of arboviral transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2809178129,"Dexterous hand function is crucial for completing activities of daily living (ADLs), which typically require precise hand-object interactions. Kinematic analyses of hand trajectory, hand velocity, and grip aperture provide valuable mechanistic insights into task performance, but there is a need for standardized tasks representative of ADLs that are amenable to motion capture and show consistent performance in non-disabled individuals. Our objective was to develop two standardized functional upper limb tasks and to quantitatively characterize the kinematics of normative hand movement.Twenty non-disabled participants were recruited to perform two tasks: the Pasta Box Task and Cup Transfer Task. A 12-camera motion capture system was used to collect kinematic data from which hand movement and grip aperture measures were calculated. Measures reported for reach-grasp and transport-release segments were hand distance travelled, hand trajectory variability, movement time, peak and percent-to-peak hand velocity, number of movement units, peak and percent-to-peak grip aperture, and percent-to-peak hand deceleration. A between-session repeatability analysis was conducted on 10 participants.Movement times were longer for transport-release compared to reach-grasp for every movement. Hand and grip aperture measures had low variability, with 55 out of 63 measures showing good repeatability (ICC > 0.75). Cross-body movements in the Pasta Box Task had longer movement times and reduced percent-to-peak hand velocity values. The Cup Transfer Task showed decoupling of peak grip aperture and peak hand deceleration for all movements. Movements requiring the clearing of an obstacle while transporting an object displayed a double velocity peak and typically a longer deceleration phase.Normative hand kinematics for two standardized functional tasks challenging various aspects of hand-object interactions important for ADLs showed excellent repeatability. The consistency in normative task performance across a variety of task demands shows promise as a potential outcome assessment for populations with upper limb impairment."
https://openalex.org/W2809023471,"The Proviral Integration site of Moloney murine leukemia virus (PIM) serine/threonine protein kinases are overexpressed in many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies and play central roles in intracellular signaling networks important in tumorigenesis, including the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathways. The three PIM kinase isozymes (PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3) share similar downstream substrates with other key oncogenic kinases and have differing but mutually compensatory functions across tumors. This supports the therapeutic potential of pan-PIM kinase inhibitors, especially in combination with other anticancer agents chosen based on their role in overlapping signaling networks. Reported here is a preclinical characterization of INCB053914, a novel, potent, and selective adenosine triphosphate-competitive pan-PIM kinase inhibitor. In vitro, INCB053914 inhibited proliferation and the phosphorylation of downstream substrates in cell lines from multiple hematologic malignancies. Effects were confirmed in primary bone marrow blasts from patients with acute myeloid leukemia treated ex vivo and in blood samples from patients receiving INCB053914 in an ongoing phase 1 dose-escalation study. In vivo, single-agent INCB053914 inhibited Bcl-2-associated death promoter protein phosphorylation and dose-dependently inhibited tumor growth in acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma xenografts. Additive or synergistic inhibition of tumor growth was observed when INCB053914 was combined with selective PI3Kδ inhibition, selective JAK1 or JAK1/2 inhibition, or cytarabine. Based on these data, pan-PIM kinase inhibitors, including INCB053914, may have therapeutic utility in hematologic malignancies when combined with other inhibitors of oncogenic kinases or standard chemotherapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2809373414,"The NAM, ATAF1/2, and CUC2 (NAC) family constitutes a large family of plant-specific transcription factors, involved in many aspects of physiological processes and a variety of abiotic stresses. There is little information concerning the NAC family in Sesamum indicum. In this study, 87 sesame NAC genes were identified and phylogenetically clustered into 12 groups with Arabidopsis NAC genes. A total of 83 SiNAC genes were distributed non-randomly on the 16 linkage groups in sesame. Four and 49 SiNACs were found to be tandemly and segmentally duplicated, respectively. Expression profiles of SiNAC genes in different tissues (root, stem, leaf, flower, seed, and capsule) and in response to drought and waterlogging stresses by using RNA-seq data demonstrated that 23 genes were highly expressed in all tissues, 18 and 31 SiNACs respond strongly to drought and waterlogging stresses, respectively. In addition, the expression of 30 SiNAC genes distributed in different subgroups was analyzed with quantitative real-time RT-PCR under cold, osmotic, and salt stresses, revealed that their expression patterns vary in response to abiotic stresses. SiNAC genes displayed diverse expression patterns among the different tissues and stress treatments, suggested that their contribution to plant growth and development in sesame and multiple stress resistance in sesame. In this study, NAC transcription factors were analyzed in sesame and some specific candidate SiNAC genes in response to abiotic stress for functional study were identified. This study provides valuable information to deepen our understanding of the abiotic stress responses by NAC transcription factors in sesame."
https://openalex.org/W2809304204,"The objectives of this study were to: (a) genotypically characterize Streptococcus agalactiae isolates recovered from clinical mastitis (CM) cases in dairy cows and, (b) determine the association of antimicrobial susceptibility (AMS) and genotypes of Strep. agalactiae clustered according to the genetic similarity. A total of 89 Strep. agalactiae isolates recovered from bovine CM were genotyped using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. In addition, the AMS of the isolates was determined using a commercial broth microdilution test composed of 10 antimicrobials (penicillin, ampicillin, oxacillin, cephalothin, ceftiofur, penicillin/novobiocin, erythromycin, pirlimycin, tetracycline, and sulfadimethoxine). Descriptive analysis was used to report the frequency of RAPD-types and genotypic clusters within herd, housing system, season and CM severity scores. The minimal antimicrobial concentrations that inhibited 50% (MIC50) and 90% (MIC90) of the isolates were calculated and survival analysis was completed to verify the differences of AMS among genotypic clusters. Results of RAPD showed a great genotypic diversity of Strep. agalactiae (45 RAPD-types) and three clusters (Ia, Ib and II) were created based on the genetic similarity among genotypes. After clustering, a high genetic similarity was observed within and between herds. Overall, Strep. agalactiae showed high susceptibility to most antimicrobials, except to tetracycline and erythromycin. Differences in the AMS among clusters were observed for ampicillin, ceftiofur, erythromycin, pirlimycin, sulfadimethoxine and tetracycline. In conclusion, Strep. agalactiae is still highly susceptible to most antimicrobials, although differences in susceptibility to certain antimicrobials were observed among genotypic clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2808822064,"Introduction Statins are widely used to inhibit cholesterol production in the liver among people with hypercholesterolemia. A recent epidemiological study in the UK has shown that statin use (unlike elevated BMI) is not associated with an increased risk of Achilles tendon rupture. However, because of laboratory reports suggesting a negative influence of statins on tenocyte metabolism, we decided to directly compare the Achilles tendon structure (cross-sectional area and longitudinal collagen organization) in regular statin users compared to non-users. Methods We conducted ultrasound tissue characterization (UTC) of the Achilles tendon in statin users and a comparison group of similar age and gender. Statin users and control participants were recruited from May 10 2015 to February 17 2017 through a cardiovascular health centre and from the general community. Cross-sectional area of the Achilles tendon and longitudinal collagen organization (% type I echoes) were assessed using quantitative ultrasound tissue characterization by a blinded observer at a predetermined location (2 cm proximal to the calcaneus). Results Sixty-six individuals who were either taking statins for at least one year (ST, n = 33) or a comparison group who had never taken statins (CG, n = 33) were included in the study. The Achilles tendon cross-sectional area (ST 59.7 (13) mm2, CG 59.9 (8.5) mm2) and proportion of echo-type I patterns [ST 70 (10)%, CG 74 (13)%] were equivalent in the two groups. In contrast, there was a negative correlation between BMI (rs = -0.25, p = 0.042) and type I echo values. Obese individuals demonstrated a significantly lower percentage of type I echoes (62 (11)%) than individuals of normal body mass index (73 (10)% p<0.05). Conclusion These findings demonstrate that there is no evidence of a negative statin influence on Achilles tendon structure. Given earlier reports that the risk of Achilles injury is equivalent in statin users and non-users, weightbearing exercise may be prescribed without placing the Achilles tendon at a higher risk of injury than among the general population. The results of this study are consistent with the known negative effects of elevated BMI on tendon structure, suggesting that an assessment of the Achilles tendons prior to prescribing weightbearing exercise may be prudent in obese individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2809657125,"Increasingly, researchers seek to engage communities, patients, and stakeholders as partners in the process and products of health research. However, there is no existing stakeholder-driven ethical framework for such engaged scholarship. We employed an iterative, stakeholder-engaged method to develop a data-driven framework for the ethical review and conduct of engaged scholarship. We used consensus development conference methods and a modified Delphi survey to engage 240 community members, ethicists, and academic researchers. This multi-staged process produced a framework with 4 domains: vision of equitable and just research, relationship dynamics, community-informed risk/benefits assessment, and accountability. Within the framework, 4 cross-cutting considerations and 15 statements explicate the stakeholders' priorities for the ethical review and conduct of engaged scholarship. Though the findings are promising, the study is limited in that it focuses on stakeholder perspectives, but does not actually evaluate or apply the findings in the field. The stakeholder-engaged framework provides a platform for further articulation of ethical practices and policy for engaged scholarship."
https://openalex.org/W2809069427,"The Semantic Link Network is a general semantic model for modeling the structure and the evolution of complex systems. Various semantic links play different roles in rendering the semantics of complex system. One of the basic semantic links represents cause-effect relation, which plays an important role in representation and understanding. This paper verifies the role of the Semantic Link Network in representing the core of text by investigating the contribution of cause-effect link to representing the core of scientific papers. Research carries out with the following steps: (1) Two propositions on the contribution of cause-effect link in rendering the core of paper are proposed and verified through a statistical survey, which shows that the sentences on cause-effect links cover about 65% of key words within each paper on average. (2) An algorithm based on syntactic patterns is designed for automatically extracting cause-effect link from scientific papers, which recalls about 70% of manually annotated cause-effect links on average, indicating that the result adapts to the scale of data sets. (3) The effects of cause-effect link on four schemes of incorporating cause-effect link into the existing instances of the Semantic Link Network for enhancing the summarization of scientific papers are investigated. The experiments show that the quality of the summaries is significantly improved, which verifies the role of semantic links. The significance of this research lies in two aspects: (1) it verifies that the Semantic Link Network connects the important concepts to render the core of text; and, (2) it provides an evidence for realizing content services such as summarization, recommendation and question answering based on the Semantic Link Network, and it can inspire relevant research on content computing."
https://openalex.org/W2809539153,"The association of delayed graft function (DGF) and biopsy proven acute rejection (BPAR) of renal allografts is controversial. Borderline rejections comprise a major portion of biopsy results but the significance of such histologic changes is debated. The present study explores the impact of DGF on BPAR with a special emphasis on discriminating the effects of borderline rejection.Single center analysis of 417 deceased donor kidney recipients (age>18; transplantation date 1/2008-2/2015). Patients with primary non-function were excluded. DGF was defined as the need for dialysis within the first week after transplantation. Acute rejection was defined according to Banff criteria. Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the relationship of DGF with BPAR within the first year.No graft loss was observed during the first year after transplantation. DGF significantly associated with BPAR in the first year, irrespective of whether borderline rejections were included (HR 1.71, 95%CI 1.16,2.53) or excluded (HR 1.79, 95%CI 1.13,2.84).DGF is significantly associated with rejection-with or without borderline changes-within the first year."
https://openalex.org/W2808838122,"Little is known of the spatio-temporal occurrence of beaked whales off western Ireland, limiting the ability of Regulators to implement appropriate management and conservation measures. To address this knowledge gap, static acoustic monitoring was carried out using eight fixed bottom-mounted autonomous acoustic recorders: four from May to December 2015 on Ireland's northern slope and four from March to November 2016 on the western and southern slopes. Recorders ran for 205 to 230 days, resulting in 4.09 TB of data sampled at 250 kHz which could capture beaked whale acoustic signals. Zero-crossing-based automated detectors identified beaked whale clicks. A sample of detections was manually validated to evaluate and optimize detector performance. Analysis confirmed the occurrence of Sowerby's and Cuvier's beaked whales and Northern bottlenose whales. Northern bottlenose whale clicks occurred in late summer and autumn, but were too few to allow further analysis. Cuvier's and Sowerby's clicks occurred at all stations throughout the monitoring period. There was a significant effect of month and station (latitude) on the mean daily number of click detections for both species. Cuvier's clicks were more abundant at lower latitudes while Sowerby's were greater at higher latitudes, particularly in the spring, suggesting a spatial segregation between species, possibly driven by prey preference. Cuvier's occurrence increased in late autumn 2015 off northwest Porcupine Bank, a region of higher relative occurrence for each species. Seismic airgun shots, with daily sound exposure levels as high as 175 dB re 1 μPa2·s, did not appear to impact the mean daily number of Cuvier's or Sowerby's beaked whale click detections. This work provides insight into the significance of Irish waters for beaked whales and highlights the importance of using acoustics for beaked whale monitoring."
https://openalex.org/W2808761516,"Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is recommended as an additional prevention choice for men who have sex with men (MSM) at substantial risk of HIV. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent, and reasons, for MSM's willingness to use oral PrEP in Wuhan and Shanghai, China.Between May and December 2015, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 487 MSM recruited through snowball sampling in physical locations frequented by MSM and through social media applications. Exploratory factor analysis was used to group reasons for being willing or not willing to use PrEP. Chi-square tests were used to explore bivariate associations between groupings of reasons for being willing or unwilling to use PrEP, and key sociodemographic and sexual-behavioral characteristics of MSM.Overall, 71.3% of respondents were willing to use PrEP. The most commonly reported reasons for being willing to use PrEP were preventing HIV infection (91.6%), taking responsibility for own sexual health (72.6%) and protecting family members from harm (59.4%). The main reasons for being unwilling to use PrEP were being worried about side effects (72.9%), the necessity of taking PrEP for long periods of time (54.3%) and cost (40.4%). Individual characteristics that influenced the type of reasons given for being willing or unwilling to use PrEP included being married to a woman, having a regular sex partner, rates of condom use with regular and casual sex partners, and the number of casual sex partners.The introduction of PrEP in China could benefit from promotion campaigns that emphasize its role in preventing HIV infection, in taking responsibility for own sexual health, and in protecting family members from potential harm. To reduce uptake barriers, it will be essential to provide accurate information to potential PrEP users about the mild and short-term nature of side effects, and the possibility of taking PrEP only during particular periods of life when the risk of HIV exposure might be highest."
https://openalex.org/W2809325972,"Background We aimed to determine participation rates and factors associated with participation in colorectal (fecal occul blood test) and cervical cancer (Pap-smear) screening among a population of women participating in breast cancer screening. Methods From August to October 2015, a self-administered questionnaire was sent by post to 2 900 women aged 50–65, living in Côte-d’Or, France, and who were up to date with mammogram screening. Polytomic logistic regression was used to identify correlates of participation in both cervical and colorectal cancer screenings. Participation in all 3 screenings was chosen as the reference. Results Study participation rate was 66.3% (n = 1856). Besides being compliant with mammogram, respectively 78.3% and 56.6% of respondents were up to date for cervical and colorectal cancer screenings, while 46.2% were compliant with the 3 screenings. Consultation with a gynecologist in the past year was associated with higher chance of undergoing the 3 screenings or female cancer screenings (p<10–4), when consultation with a GP was associated with higher chance of undergoing the 3 screenings or organized cancer screenings (p<0.05). Unemployment, obesity, age>59 and yearly flu vaccine were associated with a lower involvement in cervical cancer screening. Women from high socio-economic classes were more likely to attend only female cancer screenings (p = 0.009). Finally, a low level of physical activity and tobacco use were associated with higher risk of no additional screening participation (p<10–3 and p = 0.027). Conclusions Among women participating in breast screening, colorectal and cervical cancer screening rates could be improved. Including communication about these 2 cancer screenings in the mammogram invitation could be worth to explore."
https://openalex.org/W2809441393,"Dissatisfaction with one’s body is a widespread issue in modern society and has been linked to vulnerability for developing eating disorders. Recent studies have demonstrated a direct relationship between body perception and body satisfaction by manipulating perceived body size using multisensory body illusions. However, how these body size illusions influence implicit affective experience has not previously been examined. The current experiment used an established full-body ownership illusion paradigm to induce feelings of illusory obesity in male and female participants. The effects of illusory obesity on explicit and implicit body satisfaction were measured in naïve participants across two separate experiments. In terms of explicit measures, owning an obese body decreased body satisfaction, and owning a slimmer body increased body satisfaction in females but not in males. However, implicit feelings regarding the body were only influenced by the synchrony of the touch and not the size of the body in the illusion. These results suggest that implicit and explicit affective experiences of the body may be mediated by different factors. In addition, these findings may have clinical implications because both implicit and explicit changes in affective experience of the body were related to behaviours and thoughts associated with disordered eating in a non-clinical sample."
https://openalex.org/W2809548334,"Although small intestinal epithelial stem cells form crypts when using intestinal culture conditions, colon stem cells usually form colonospheres. Colon mesenchymal cell feeder layers can stimulate colon crypts to form organoids and produce crypts. We have investigated whether conditioned medium from colon mesenchymal cells can also stimulate colonosphere and organoid cryptogenesis. We prepared conditioned medium (CM) from WEHI-YH2 cells (mouse colon myofibroblasts); the CM stimulated both colonosphere formation and organoid cryptogenesis in vitro. The colon organoid-stimulating factors in WEHI-YH2 CM are inactivated by heating and trypsin digestion and proteins can be concentrated by ultrafiltration. Both the colonosphere- and organoid cryptogenesis- stimulatory effects of the CM are independent of canonical Wnt and Notch signaling. In contrast, bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4) abolishes colonosphere formation and organoid cryptogenesis. The Transforming Growth Factor beta (TGFβ) Type I receptor kinase inhibitor (A83-01) stimulates colonosphere formation, whereas the Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor (AG1478) reduces the formation of colonospheres, but in the presence of EGF, a ""just-right"" concentration of AG1478 increases colon organoid cryptogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2808193378,"Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a disease that appreciably impacts on the quality of life of patients and is associated with high expenditure. MS is a chronic multifactorial disease, characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss. The Brazilian public health system provides pharmacological treatment as well as hospital and outpatient care for patients with relapsing-remitting and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. However, we are not aware of any previous publications assessing total direct medical costs in patients with a long follow-up within the Brazilian healthcare system. Consequently, the objective is to analyze public spending on patients with MS to guide stakeholders in future investment and disinvestment decisions.We retrospectively analyzed public Brazilian spending on patients with MS between 2000 and 2015 using the patient-centered registry of all patients in the public health system (SUS) obtained through deterministic-probabilistic record linkage of the Outpatient Information System, Hospital Information System and Mortality Information Systems in Brazil. Descriptive data analysis and a multiple linear regression model was performed to evaluate the associations between the mean annual cost per patient and the clinical and demographic variables. The suitability of the model was verified from a residue analysis and the level of significance adopted was 5%.28,401 patients were identified and subsequently 23,082 patients were analyzed. The majority of the patients were female (73.3%), lived in the southeast region (58.9%), had a mean age of 36.8 (± 12.2) years and started treatment using one of the interferons beta (78.9%). The total direct medical cost spending in the sixteen years of the follow-up was US $ 2,308,393,465.60, and the mean annual expenditure per patient was US $ 13,544.40 (± 4,607.05). In the best fit model (p <0.001), approximately 40% of the variability of the mean annual cost per patient was explained by the region of residence; medication used (intention to treat); if the patient was a non-exclusive user of medicines, i.e., used SUS for other procedures other than high-cost medicines; year of treatment start; and presence of events (death; Relapse; change of treatment and/or comorbidity).In the public health system of Brazil, disease modifying therapies currently represent almost all of the total direct costs of multiple sclerosis treatment. Around the world, new and emerging health technologies to treat of MS impose a challenge to health budgets, highlighting the need for cost-effectiveness studies comparing these technologies to those already available. Our regression model may help in this process, and calls attention to the need to access the real world performance of new therapies available in SUS, with the potential for disinvestment and/ or price reductions if needed."
https://openalex.org/W2809036233,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an important manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis, with diabetes being one of its most significant risk factors. Owing to medial arterial calcification (MAC), the ankle–brachial index (ABI) is not always a reliable tool for detecting PAD. Arterial Doppler flow parameters, such as systolic maximal acceleration (ACCmax) and relative pulse slope index (RPSI), may serve as effective surrogates to detect stenosis-induced flow alteration. In the present study, ACCmax and RPSI were prospectively evaluated in 166 patients (304 arteries) with clinical suspicion of PAD, including 76 patients with and 90 patients without diabetes. In the overall sample, the sensitivity of ACCmax (69%) was superior to that of ABI (58%) and RPSI (56%). In patients with diabetes, the sensitivity of ACCmax (57%), ABI (56%) and RPSI (57%) were similar, though a parallel test taking both ACCmax and RPSI into account further increased sensitivity to 68%. The specificity (98%) and accuracy (78%) of ACCmax were superior to those of ABI (83% and 70%, respectively), as were the specificity (95%) and accuracy (77%) of RPSI in patients with diabetes. The diagnostic properties of ACCmax and RPSI were superior to those of ABI for detecting PAD in patients with diabetes. Our acceleration algorithm (Gefäßtachometer®) provides a rapid, safe, noninvasive tool for identifying PAD in patients with diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2808926562,"Two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P) constitute major candidates for the regulation of background potassium currents in mammalian cells. Channels of the TREK subfamily are also well positioned to play an important role in sensory transduction due to their sensitivity to a large number of physiological and physical stimuli (pH, mechanical, temperature). Following our previous report describing the molecular expression of different K2P channels in the vagal sensory system, here we confirm that TREK channels are functionally expressed in neurons from the mouse nodose ganglion (mNG). Neurons were subdivided into three groups (A, Ah and C) based on their response to tetrodotoxin and capsaicin. Application of the TREK subfamily activator riluzole to isolated mNG neurons evoked a concentration-dependent outward current in the majority of cells from all the three subtypes studied. Riluzole increased membrane conductance and hyperpolarized the membrane potential by approximately 10 mV when applied to resting neurons. The resting potential was similar in all three groups, but C cells were clearly less excitable and showed smaller hyperpolarization-activated currents at -100 mV and smaller sustained currents at -30 mV. Our results indicate that the TREK subfamily of K2P channels might play an important role in the maintenance of the resting membrane potential in sensory neurons of the autonomic nervous system, suggesting its participation in the modulation of vagal reflexes."
https://openalex.org/W2809247973,"Introduction Homozygous deficiencies of complement C4A or C4B are detected in 1–10% of populations. In genome-wide association studies C4 deficiencies are missed because the genetic variation of C4 is complex. There are no studies where the clinical presentation of these patients is analyzed. This study was aimed to characterize the clinical features of patients with homozygous C4A or C4B deficiency. Material and methods Thirty-two patients with no functional C4A, 87 patients with no C4B and 120 with normal amount of C4 genes were included. C4A and C4B numbers were assessed with genomic quantitative real-time PCR. Medical history was studied retrospectively from patients’ files. Results Novel associations between homozygous C4A deficiency and lymphoma, coeliac disease and sarcoidosis were detected. These conditions were present in 12.5%, (4/32 in patients vs. 0.8%, 1/120, in controls, OR = 17.00, 95%CI = 1.83–158.04, p = 0.007), 12.5% (4/32 in patients vs. 0%, 0/120 in controls, OR = 1.14, 95%CI = 1.00–1.30, p = 0.002) and 12.5%, respectively (4/32 in patients vs. 2.5%, 3/120 in controls, OR = 5.571, 95%CI = 1.79–2.32, p = 0.036). In addition, C4A and C4B deficiencies were both associated with adverse drug reactions leading to drug discontinuation (34.4%, 11/32 in C4A-deficient patients vs. 14.2%, 17/120 in controls, OR = 3.174, 95%CI = 1.30–7.74, p = 0.009 and 28.7%, 25/87 in C4B-deficient patients, OR = 2.44, 95%CI = 1.22–4.88, p = 0.010). Conclusion This reported cohort of homozygous deficiencies of C4A or C4B suggests that C4 deficiencies may have various unrecorded disease associations. C4 gene should be considered as a candidate gene in studying these selected disease associations."

Its prevalence is increasing in parallel with the prevalence of obesity and other components of the metabolic syndrome. As the liver is central to the clearance and catabolism of circulating advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs), AGEs and their cognate receptors—RAGE (receptor for AGEs) system might be involved in NAFLD in obese patients. To examine this, we investigated four common polymorphisms of RAGE gene: 1704G/T (rs184003), G82S (rs2070600), -374T/A (rs1800624) and −429T/C (rs1800625) in 340 obese patients with metabolic syndrome. and protein levels of AGE and RAGE. This is the first study to describe association of 4 common polymorphisms with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) as well as to examine protein levels of RAGE and AGE. Univariate analysis showed patients carrying the rs1800624 heterozygote genotype (AT) exhibited 2.36-fold increased risk of NASH (odds ratio (OR) = 2.36; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.35–4.19) after adjusting for confounders. The minor allele -374 A has been shown to suppress the expression of RAGE protein. The protein levels of esRAGE, total sRAGE and AGE protein levels did not correlate with each other in obese patients with no liver disease, indicative of RAGE signaling playing an independent role in liver injury. In obese patients with non-NASH NAFLD and NASH respectively, esRAGE protein showed strong positive correlation with total sRAGE protein. Further, haplotype analysis of the 4 SNPs, indicated that haplotype G-A-T-G was significantly associated with 2-fold increased risk for NASH (OR = 2.08; 95% CI: 1.21–3.5; P = 0.006) after adjusting for confounders. In conclusion, the presented data indicate that the G-A-T-G haplotype containing minor allele at position −374 A and major allele at position −429T, 1704G, and G82S G could be regarded as a marker for NASH."
https://openalex.org/W2809583306,"The envelope glycoprotein 51 (gp51) is essential for bovine leukaemia virus (BLV) entry to bovine B-lymphocytes. Although the bovine adaptor protein 3 complex subunit delta-1 (boAP3D1) has been proposed as the potential receptor, the specific ligand-receptor interaction has not yet been completely defined and boAP3D1 receptor and gp51 3D structures have not been determined. This study was thus aimed at a functional annotation of boAP3D1 cellular adaptor protein and BLV gp51 and, proposing a reliable model for gp51-AP3D1 interaction using bioinformatics tools. The boAP3D1 receptor interaction patterns were calculated based on models of boAP3D1 receptor and gp51 complexes' 3D structures, which were constructed using homology techniques and data-driven docking strategy. The results showed that the participation of 6 key amino acids (aa) on gp51 (Asn170, Trp127, His115, Ala97, Ser98 and Glu128) and 4 aa on AP3D1 (Lys925, Asp807, Asp695 and Arg800) was highly probable in the interaction between gp51 and BLVR domains. Three gp51 recombinant peptides were expressed and purified to validate these results: the complete domain (rgp51), the N-terminal portion (rNgp51) and the C-terminal fragment (rCgp51); and binding assays to Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells were then carried out with each recombinant. It was found that rNgp51 preferentially bound to MDBK cells, suggesting this domain's functional role during invasion. The rNgp51-MDBK cell interaction was sensitive to trypsin (98% reduction) and chymotrypsin treatment (80% reduction). These results highlighted that the N-terminal portion of gp51 interacted in vitro with the AP3D1 receptor and provides a plausible in silico interaction model."
https://openalex.org/W2808862463,"The aim of this study was to analyze the information needs of lung cancer patients from diagnosis until first treatment follow-up. Sixty-nine participants with lung cancer were recruited from Ditmanson Medical Foundation Chia-Yi Christian Hospital in Midwest Taiwan. The Modified Toronto Informational Needs Questionnaire (TINQ) was used to assess information needs during visits to the outpatient oncology department. Generalized estimating equations were applied to compare changes in information needs over time and to examine correlates of information needs of lung cancer patients. The greatest concern of lung cancer patients was the cancer itself and access to recovery information. The need for information regarding food selection and social welfare resources was also high. However, the means of information needs for each domain significantly decreased over time. Demographic information (age, gender, disease stage, current treatment, education, work status, and having children) was significantly associated with information needs over time. The need for ""disease-related information"" remained high regardless of disease stage. Oncology nurses can use the results of this study to better address the information needs of patients in an effort to fill knowledge gaps between patients and healthcare providers. Further studies are needed to explore the use of an appropriate instrument, like that used in this study, to identify newly-diagnosed lung cancer patients' difficulties, concerns, and target interventions to improve their quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2809176826,"People often assume that moral and religious convictions are functionally the same thing. But are they? We report on 19 studies (N = 12,284) that tested whether people’s perceptions that their attitudes are reflections of their moral and religious convictions across 30 different issues were functionally the same (the equivalence hypothesis) or different constructs (the distinct constructs hypothesis), and whether the relationship between these constructs was conditional on political orientation (the political asymmetry hypothesis). Seven of these studies (N = 5,561, and 22 issues) also had data that allowed us to test whether moral and religious conviction are only closely related for those who are more rather than less religious (the secularization hypothesis), and a narrower form of the political asymmetry and secularization hypotheses, that is, that people’s moral and religious convictions may be tightly connected constructs only for religious conservatives. Meta-analytic tests of each of these hypotheses yielded weak support for the secularization hypothesis, no support for the equivalence or political asymmetry hypotheses, and the strongest support for the distinct constructs hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W2808892232,"In this paper, we investigate how crude oil price and volume traded affected the profitability of oil and gas companies in the United Kingdom (UK) since the financial crisis started in 2008. The study benefit from insights of the financial statements, to develop a model that focuses on how changes in oil price impact corporate performance. In order to observe the financial indicators that influence the performance, as well as the effects that changes in oil prices and demand of crude oil have on the profitability of oil and gas companies, we apply comparative regression analysis, including the generalised method of moments estimation technique for panel data set. The sample is consisting of 31 oil and gas companies in the UK, and the period analysed is 2006-2014. Results show that profitable oil and gas companies managed to face the drop in oil price and recover, characterized by significant cash flows and stock turnover, efficient use of assets, and high solvency rates. Although the oil price and volume traded do not significantly affect profitability and other financial ratios, if the oil price continues to decrease, it would permanently alter both the UK economy and oil and gas companies. In order to survive, companies make drastic cuts and defer essential investments, often at the long-term expense of asset performance. This study is important in a world where the energy consumption steadily grew over time. However, the renewable energy is cheaper and more environmentally friendly, and thus, countries where oil and gas industry is one of the most popular sectors face an economic decline. These results could be useful for investors, managers or decision makers, reclaiming strategic decisions in the current uncertain and volatile environment."
https://openalex.org/W2809380394,"Purpose To highlight the potential shortcomings associated with the current use Rasch analysis for validation of ophthalmic questionnaires, and to present an alternative application of Rasch analysis to derive insights specific to the cohort of patients under investigation. Methods An alternative application of Rasch analysis was used to investigate the quality of vision (QoV) for a cohort of 481 patients. Patients received multifocal intraocular lenses and completed a QoV questionnaire one and twelve months post-operatively. The rating scale variant of the polytomous Rasch model was utilized. The parameters of the model were estimated using the joint maximum likelihood estimation. Analysis was performed on data at both post-operative assessments, and the outcomes were compared. Results The distribution of the location of symptoms altered between assessments with the most annoyed patients completely differing. One month post-operatively, the most prevalent symptom was starbursts compared to glare at twelve months. The visual discomfort from the most annoyed patients is substantially higher at twelve months. The current most advocated approach for validating questionnaires using Rasch analysis found that the questionnaire was “Rasch-valid” one month post-operatively and “Rasch-invalid” twelve months post-operatively. Conclusion The proposed alternative application of Rasch analysis to questionnaires can be used as an effective decision support tool at population and individual level. At population level, this new approach enables one to investigate the prevalence of symptoms across different cohorts of patients. At individual level, the new approach enables one to identify patients with poor QoV over time. This study highlights some of the potential shortcomings associated with the current use of Rasch analysis to validate questionnaires."
https://openalex.org/W2809603419,"Underreporting is a quality concern in mortality statistics. The purpose of this study was to assess and adjust underreporting in the population-based cause-of-death statistics. The total population (96 million) in Shandong, China was divided into 262 subcounty level populations geographically and by residence type (urban/rural). For each subpopulation, the total number of deaths during the years 2011–2013 was determined using data from the Household Registration System (HRS), and was used as a reference to assess the underreporting rate (UR) in the cause-of-death data from the Shandong Death Registration System (SDRS). It was estimated that 454,615 deaths, or 21.5% (95% CI: 21.4–21.5%) were unreported. Underreporting was more pronounced in rural (22.1%) versus urban communities (20.0%), in economically underdeveloped regions (32% versus 16% in least disadvantaged areas), and in newly included sites with no prior experience in cause-of-death reporting (24% versus 17%). Geographic variation was large with a UR at the prefectural level ranging from 11.2% to 43.7%. A stratified analysis showed that UR was higher in rural populations in high-income regions, but in middle- and low-income regions, was higher in urban communities. An adjustment factor (AF) was calculated for each of the 262 subpopulations (ranging from 0.9 to 2.5 with an average of 1.27). The total morality rate was adjusted from 6.03 to 7.67 deaths per 1000 persons. Underreporting in the SDRS varies greatly between areas and populations and is related to residence type, prior experience and local economy. Correcting underreporting at a local level is needed especially for comparative analyses across geographical areas or populations."
https://openalex.org/W2808728047,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the synovial joints. Though the current RA therapeutics such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and biologics can halt the progression of the disease, none of these would either dramatically reduce or cure RA. So, the identification of potential therapeutic targets and new therapies for RA are active areas of research. Several studies have discovered the involvement of cytokines in the pathogenesis of this disease. These cytokines induce signal transduction pathways in RA synovial fibroblasts (RASF). These pathways share many signal transducers and their interacting proteins, resulting in the formation of a signaling network. In order to understand the involvement of this network in RA pathogenesis, it is essential to identify the key transducers and their interacting proteins that are part of this network. In this study, based on a detailed literature survey, we have identified a list of 12 cytokines that induce signal transduction pathways in RASF. For these cytokines, we have built a signaling network using the protein-protein interaction (PPI) data that was obtained from public repositories such as HPRD, BioGRID, MINT, IntAct and STRING. By combining the network centrality measures with the gene expression data from the RA related microarrays that are available in the open source Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we have identified 24 key proteins of this signaling network. Two of these 24 are already drug targets for RA, and of the remaining, 12 have direct PPI links to some of the current drug targets of RA. Therefore, these key proteins seem to be crucial in the pathogenesis of RA and hence might be treated as potential drug targets."
https://openalex.org/W2808792225,"A growing amount of evidence suggests that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is associated with cardiometabolic risk. However, there have been few longitudinal studies. The aim of this study was to explore the causal relationship between TSH and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in a large population-based longitudinal study. From 2010 to 2016 at the Health Management Center at Tri-Service General Hospital, 25,121 eligible patients were enrolled in our cross-sectional analyses. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the longitudinal association among hypertension (HTN), prediabetes (pre-DM), MetS, diabetes (DM) and TSH levels (N = 12,463). The average follow-up time was 7.2 years. In the cross-sectional analysis, the OR for MetS was 1.06 (95% CI = 1.03-1.09; P< 0.05), while the ORs for DM, pre-DM or HTN were not statistically significant (all P> 0.05). After dividing TSH levels into four quartiles, the ORs for the presence of MetS determined by comparing the highest TSH quartile with the lowest TSH quartile were 1.37 (95% CI = 1.18-1.60), 1.42 (95% CI = 1.20-1.67), and 1.44 (95% CI = 1.22-1.69) (all, P<0.05) in model 1, model 2 and model 3 respectively. The HR for the incidence of MetS was 1.33 (95% CI = 1.17-1.51; P < 0.05). Our study revealed that TSH levels had a strong association with incident MetS."
https://openalex.org/W2809193191,"In view of recent revised recommendations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) confirmatory testing, the performance of 3 HIV confirmatory assays was compared. Using the HIV Blot 2.2 (MP-WB), the INNO-LIA HIV I/II Score (INNO), and the Geenius HIV 1/2 Confirmatory Assay (Geenius), we tested 199 HIV-1 positive, 161 HIV negative, 65 HIV western blot indeterminate, 26 HIV seroconversion, 34 early HIV infection and 4 HIV-2 positive archived specimens. We show that all 3 assays had comparable test sensitivity in the detection of HIV-1 positive cases. However, less non-specific reactivity was observed with the INNO and Geenius assays, where both of them were able to resolve MP-WB indeterminate cases. When early HIV cases were considered, INNO and Geenius were more likely to confirm an early-stage infection as positive. Nevertheless, overall poor sensitivity (25.5% - 44.7%) of these assays for the detection of early cases was observed, likely because these cases had very low or non-detectable levels of HIV antibodies. Hence, further testing by a nucleic acid test or a p24 antigen test of specimens reactive on screening with a fourth generation Ag/Ab assay that are negative on confirmatory testing for HIV-specific antibody, may be useful. In conclusion, INNO and Geenius had comparable test performance, although the ease of use and shorter assay time for Geenius may make it the preferred choice for laboratories. In that regard, of note is our observation of non-specific reactivity of lipaemic specimens to the HIV-2 gp140 band in the Geenius assay, which should prompt caution when interpreting results of such specimens."
https://openalex.org/W2809426992,"Biogeochemical models use meteorological forcing data derived with different approaches (e.g. based on interpolation or reanalysis of observation data or a hybrid hereof) to simulate ecosystem processes such as gross primary productivity (GPP). This study assesses the impact of different widely used climate datasets on simulated gross primary productivity and evaluates the suitability of them for reproducing the global and regional carbon cycle as mapped from independent GPP data. We simulate GPP with the biogeochemical model LPJ-GUESS using six historical climate datasets (CRU, CRUNCEP, ECMWF, NCEP, PRINCETON, and WFDEI). The simulated GPP is evaluated using an observation-based GPP product derived from eddy covariance measurements in combination with remotely sensed data. Our results show that all datasets tested produce relatively similar GPP simulations at a global scale, corresponding fairly well to the observation-based data with a difference between simulations and observations ranging from -50 to 60 g m-2 yr-1. However, all simulations also show a strong underestimation of GPP (ranging from -533 to -870 g m-2 yr-1) and low temporal agreement (r < 0.4) with observations over tropical areas. As the shortwave radiation for tropical areas was found to have the highest uncertainty in the analyzed historical climate datasets, we test whether simulation results could be improved by a correction of the tested shortwave radiation for tropical areas using a new radiation product from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP). A large improvement (up to 48%) in simulated GPP magnitude was observed with bias corrected shortwave radiation, as well as an increase in spatio-temporal agreement between the simulated GPP and observation-based GPP. This study conducts a spatial inter-comparison and quantification of the performances of climate datasets and can thereby facilitate the selection of climate forcing data over any given study area for modelling purposes."

This cross-sectional study was conducted in four large indoor fitness centers in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This study involved male fitness center members aged ≥18 years with no speech or hearing disabilities. In-person interviews were conducted with fitness center members who agreed to participate using a newly developed questionnaire. Information on participants' sociodemographics (e.g., age and education), smoking status, health status, exercise frequency, average time spent exercising, different supplements used, used supplements sources, and health beliefs regarding dietary supplements were obtained. A total of 445 fitness center members agreed to participate, and 198 of them reported taking dietary supplements. Most participants were between the age of 18 and 25 years (66%), had a college degree (74%), non-smokers (77%), healthy (84%), and perform exercise at least thrice weekly (52%) for at least 1 hour (63%). The percentage of participants who had favorable health views on dietary supplements was significantly higher among the supplement users than among the non-users (P<0.0001). Proteins, multivitamins, amino acids, and omega 3 fatty acids were the most commonly reported supplements used. Almost 30% of the supplement users reported buying them overseas, 28% online, 25% from a pharmacy or supplement store, 19% from a medical clinic, and 17% from peddlers. Public health campaigns are needed to educate the public on the potential harmful effects of supplements if purchased from an unofficial seller or taken without seeking medical advice before using them."
https://openalex.org/W2809192889,"There is general pressure throughout the world’s fisheries for the industry to have greater involvement not only in the development of fishing gears but also in the testing and documentation of their effect. In the European Union, the Common Fisheries Policy of 2013, together with the proposed reform of the technical measures regulation, highlights the need for greater flexibility in fisheries through increased stakeholder involvement. To achieve this flexibility, there is a need for additional fishing gears available to the fishermen. A way to facilitate this is to have the industry take part in the development and testing of fishing gears, as well as collect data on their performance. However, to have a successful industry-collected data programme, fishermen have to be able to collect data on the length of a portion of the catch. In this study, we determine how many individuals need to be measured to correctly evaluate the relative selective performance of a new gear compared to a standard gear. The evaluation was carried out by analysing catch ratio curves, their associated uncertainties, and the trade-offs between uncertainties and sampling effort. Results show that with relatively small sample sizes (500 to 1000 individuals) it is possible to correctly evaluate the performance of a gear for a given species. By having the industry develop and test their own gears, as well as being involved in the collection of data, the number of potential gear solutions available to address the different issues emerging in the fisheries is increased."
https://openalex.org/W2809331210,"Population sex ratios are of high ecological relevance, but are challenging to determine in species lacking conspicuous external cues indicating their sex. Acoustic sexing is an option if vocalizations differ between sexes, but is precluded by overlapping distributions of the values of male and female vocalizations in many species. A method allowing the inference of sex ratios despite such an overlap will therefore greatly increase the information extractable from acoustic data. To meet this demand, we developed a novel approach using Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to infer the sex ratio of populations from acoustic data. Additionally, parameters characterizing the male and female distribution of acoustic values (mean and standard deviation) are inferred. This information is then used to probabilistically assign a sex to a single acoustic signal. We furthermore develop a simpler means of sex ratio estimation based on the exclusion of calls from the overlap zone. Applying our methods to simulated data demonstrates that sex ratio and acoustic parameter characteristics of males and females are reliably inferred by the ABC approach. Applying both the ABC and the exclusion method to empirical datasets (echolocation calls recorded in colonies of lesser horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus hipposideros) provides similar sex ratios as molecular sexing. Our methods aim to facilitate evidence-based conservation, and to benefit scientists investigating ecological or conservation questions related to sex- or group specific behaviour across a wide range of organisms emitting acoustic signals. The developed methodology is non-invasive, low-cost and time-efficient, thus allowing the study of many sites and individuals. We provide an R-script for the easy application of the method and discuss potential future extensions and fields of applications. The script can be easily adapted to account for numerous biological systems by adjusting the type and number of groups to be distinguished (e.g. age, social rank, cryptic species) and the acoustic parameters investigated."

The wild grapevine arises in the Eastern Adriatic region in a contact zone of the EU-Mediterranean and the sub-Mediterranean characterized by typical karst relief. This study focuses on the chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) analysis of wild grapevines and the biodiversity of accompanying woody species to better understand the genetic variation of the sylvestris populations of the Eastern Adriatic region and to investigate how this variation fits within today’s wild grapevine distribution in the European continent. The allelic variation at nine cpDNA microsatellite loci of wild individuals was used to characterize haplotype diversity in 53 individuals from four population sites. All individuals were grouped into two chlorotypes: A and D, D being the rare haplotype among wild populations on the European continent. In total, 52 woody plant species were identified. However, the studied vegetation structures have been affected by permanent human pressure on natural resources and the preservation status of the collection sites. Based on our results, we conclude that the investigated areas were probably shelter zones for wild grapevine preservation during the unfavorable glaciation era."
https://openalex.org/W2808789676,"Recently several studies demonstrated a role for the Wnt pathway in lymphocyte development and self-renewal of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). B-1 cells constitute a separate lineage of B lymphocytes, originating during fetal hematopoiesis, expressing lymphoid and myeloid markers and possessing self-renewal ability, similar to early hematopoietic progenitors and HSCs. A plethora of studies have shown an important role for the evolutionary conserved Wnt pathway in the biology of HSCs and T lymphocyte development. Our previous data demonstrated abundant expression of Wnt pathway components by B-1 cells, including Wnt ligands and receptors. Here we report that the canonical Wnt pathway is activated in B-1 cell precursors, but not in mature B-1 cells. However, both B-1 precursors and B-1 cells are able to respond to Wnt ligands in vitro. Canonical Wnt activity promotes proliferation of B-1 cells, while non-canonical Wnt signals induce the expansion of B-1 precursors. Interestingly, using a co-culture system with OP9 cells, Wnt3a stimulus supported the generation of B-1a cells. Taking together, these results indicate that B-1 cells and their progenitors are differentially responsive to Wnt ligands, and that the balance of activation of canonical and non-canonical Wnt signaling may regulate the maintenance and differentiation of different B-1 cell subsets."
https://openalex.org/W2809485668,"Bacteria respond to environmental changes through the co-ordinated regulation of gene expression, often mediated by two-component regulatory systems (TCS). Group A Streptococcus (GAS), a bacterium which infects multiple human body sites and causes multiple diseases, possesses up to 14 TCS. In this study we examined genetic variation in the coding sequences and non-coding DNA upstream of these TCS as a method for evaluating relationships between different GAS emm-types, and potential associations with GAS disease. Twelve of the 14 TCS were present in 90% of the genomes examined. The length of the intergenic regions (IGRs) upstream of TCS coding regions varied from 39 to 345 nucleotides, with an average nucleotide diversity of 0.0064. Overall, IGR allelic variation was generally conserved with an emm-type. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of concatenated sequences based on all TCS IGR sequences grouped genomes of the same emm-type together. However grouping with emm-pattern and emm-cluster-types was much weaker, suggesting epidemiological and functional properties associated with the latter are not due to evolutionary relatedness of emm-types. All emm5, emm6 and most of the emm18 genomes, all historically considered rheumatogenic emm-types clustered together, suggesting a shared evolutionary history. However emm1, emm3 and several emm18 genomes did not cluster within this group. These latter emm18 isolates were epidemiologically distinct from other emm18 genomes in study, providing evidence for local variation. emm-types associated with invasive disease or nephritogenicity also did not cluster together. Considering the TCS coding sequences (cds), correlation with emm-type was weaker than for the IGRs, and no strong correlation with disease was observed. Deletion of the malate transporter, maeP, was identified that serves as a putative marker for the emm89.0 subtype, which has been implicated in invasive outbreaks. A recombination-related, subclade-forming DNA motif was identified in the putative receiver domain of the Spy1556 response regulator that correlated with throat-associated emm-pattern-type A-C strains."
https://openalex.org/W2809523761,"In trotting horses, movement asymmetry is associated with ground reaction force asymmetry. In humans, limb length differences influence contralateral force production. Here we investigate whether horses, in immediate reaction to limb length changes, show movement asymmetry adaptations consistent with reported force differences. Aim of this study was to quantify pelvic and compensatory head and withers movement asymmetry as a function of limb length changes after application of orthotic lifts. In this experimental study movement asymmetry of eleven trotting horses was calculated from vertical displacement of poll, withers, sacrum and left and right tuber coxae with inertial sensors. Horses were assessed in-hand under 5 conditions (all with hind limb boots): without orthotic lifts, and with a 15mm or 30mm orthotic lift applied to the left hind or right hind. A linear mixed model investigated the influence of orthotic lift condition (P<0.05, pairwise posthoc Bonferroni correction). Pelvic movement asymmetry showed increased pelvic downward movement during stance of the shorter limb and increased pelvic upward movement during and after stance of the longer limb (P<0.001) with asymmetry changes of 3-7mm (4-10mm) for 15mm (30mm) lifts. Hip hike (tuber coxae movement asymmetry) was unaffected (P = 0.348). Head and withers movement asymmetry were affected less consistently (2 of 3 respectively 1 of 3 head or withers parameters). The small sample size of the study reduced generalizability, no direct force measurements were conducted and only immediate effects of orthotic lifts were assessed with no re-assessments days or weeks after. Conclusions about mechanical consequences (weight bearing, pushoff) are based on published movement-force associations. Pelvic movement asymmetry with an artificial change in limb length through application of an orthotic lift indicates increased weight support with the shorter limb and increased pushoff with the longer limb. This may be of relevance for the management of horses with different hoof shapes between contralateral limbs, for example some chronically lame horse."

In this study, we describe how pregnant women and mothers of young children react when CHWs inform them that they, or their child, are at high risk of pregnancy-related complications or early childhood developmental delays, and further screening and health care from a physician is recommended.In this longitudinal study in rural villages in West Bengal, India, pregnant mothers, as well as mothers of children aged 12-24 months, were screened for high risk complications. They were re-contacted and asked questions regarding how and to what extent did visits by the CHWs improve their household's overall health behavior, along with details about what additional care, if any, they sought. These responses are presented by different demographic and medical characteristics.Of the 231 pregnant women, all said they had sought additional care in response to the CHW visit, and all stated that feedback from the CHW resulted in improvement to their health behaviors. Most (90%) pregnant women gave birth at an institution. Among the 213 mothers of young children who were followed up, all sought additional care in response to the CHW's visit. Most (67%) mentioned that they had a significant improvement in their health behaviors following feedback from the CHW, and the rest stated that they had some improvement.With the proper training, CHWs can be partners in health care to improve the health of vulnerable populations, not only in rural areas of India, but also in other developing countries.

https://openalex.org/W2809071331,"Synthetic biology is currently one of the most frequently addressed emerging biotechnologies. Developments within this field receive a great deal of attention in media coverage, in which they are frequently illustrated by certain forms of metaphorical speech. Although it can be assumed that societal perceptions and evaluations of emerging biotechnologies are shaped by media coverage and its transported images, there is a lack of empirical research examining the reporting on synthetic biology as well as the use and function of metaphors within media articles. Thus, filling in this gap is one of the urgent desiderata for gaining an enhanced understanding of public views and assessments of this field of biotechnology. Against this background, this article addresses two main questions: (1) Which metaphors and framings are prevalent in the media discourse and what meaning do they have? (2) In which way are metaphors used in media coverage and what function do they have? The research is based on a media content analysis and includes a total number of 11.867 German- as well as English-language media articles dealing with synthetic biology, covering the period between 2004 and 2015. The findings suggest that forms of metaphorical speech address the novelty of current and envisioned scientific developments, highlighting their potential to shift social values and cultural concepts of life and nature. Basic expressions for describing progress within the field of synthetic biology are mainly descriptive metaphors originating from the semantic fields of craft, engineering, IT or art. In comparison, the total frequency of religiously charged metaphors, such as ""playing God"" or ""creating life"", is substantially lower. This low usage rate of religio-cultural expressions in media coverage can be considered a surprising result, since other empirical studies and particularly the ongoing broader ethical discussion attach more importance to these forms of metaphorical speech."

There is a growing need for field biology studies to shift towards increasing efficiency and quality of results while simultaneously decreasing cost in both the researcher’s time and resources. I tested the efficacy of using multiple recorded birdcall lures (n = 172 species) to improve mist-net captures at a subtropical African savanna setting. Capture success was compared between passive and birdcall enhanced mist-nets during winter and summer seasons. Results suggest that the use of birdcalls does significantly increase the total number of birds caught in both seasons and also increases the diversity of passerine species. Conventional passive mist-nets without an audio lure were initially productive but their capture rate subsequently decreased as sampling days progressed. Birdcall lure enhanced mist-nets had a constant capture output during the summer season. The most responsive birds to audio lures were gregarious species (e.g. Pycnonotus barbatus, Dryoscopus cubla, Prionops plumatus, Phoeniculus purpureus, Turdoides jardineii and Lamprotornis chalybaeus) and the aggressive Dicrurus adsimilis and Acridotheres tristis. I conclude that birdcall lures can be used in summer and winter seasons to improve mist-net captures especially for studies focusing on gregarious and aggressive passerine species in a sub-tropical African savanna setting."
https://openalex.org/W2809198580,"Echocardiography represents the most commonly performed noninvasive cardiac imaging test for patients with heart failure (HF). The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between exercise capacity parameters (peak oxygen consumption (VO2) and the minute ventilation-carbon dioxide production relationship (VE/VCO2)), two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE) and three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) imaging of right ventricular (RV) function in HF patients with reduced ejection fraction (EF).This cross-sectional study included 54 patients with diagnosed ischemic LV systolic dysfunction (HF with reduced EF <40%) divided in subgroups based on the proposed values of the analyzed cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) variables: VO2 peak ≤ 15 ml/kg/min, VO2 peak > 15 ml/kg/min, VE/VCO2 slope < 36 and VE/VCO2 slope ≥ 36. All patients underwent a physical examination, laboratory testing, conventional echocardiography, 2D-STE, 3DE, and CPET.RV fractional area change (FAC), 2D RV global longitudinal strain (GLS), 3D RV EF were significantly decreased, and RV basal diameter (BD), systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), ratio between tricuspid flow and tissue Doppler derived e' of the lateral tricuspid annulus (TV E/e') were significantly increased in the subgroups of subjects with a worse VO2 peak and VE/VCO2 slope values. There was a significant positive correlation between the peak VO2 values and TAPSE, 2D RV GLS, 3D RV SV, and 3D RV EF as well as a significantly inverse correlation with VE/VCO2 slope.The observed significant correlation between the examined parameters suggests that 2D RV GLS and 3D RV EF, SV are associated with exercise capacity in patients with reduced HF."
https://openalex.org/W2809267403,"Purpose This study sought to investigate the association between tomographic femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) angles and histologically evaluated labral tears. The authors hypothesized that cadavers presenting with cam and pincer morphologies would present a higher prevalence of acetabular labral tears. Methods Twenty fresh cadavers were submitted to computed tomography. Standard FAI angles were measured, including the alpha angle, femoral version, acetabular version, Tonnis angle and center-edge angle. A cam lesion was defined as an alpha angle greater than 50o. A pincer lesion was defined as a center-edge angle greater than 40o, a Tonnis angle less than 0o or acetabular version less than 0o. After dissection, three fragments of each acetabulum, corresponding to the antero-superior, superior and postero-superior acetabular rim, were obtained. These fragments were submitted to routine histological preparation. Each slide was evaluated for possible labral tears. Tears were classified according to their Seldes type. Results The mean age of the cadavers was 50.2 years (SD: 7.4; 13 males). Sixteen (80%) of the cadavers had a cam lesion, and eight cadavers (40%) had a pincer lesion. Histologically, 16 (80%) of the cadavers had a labral tear in at least one region. According to the Seldes classification, 60.7% and 28.6% of these labral tears were type 1 and type 2, respectively. A mixed type of labral tear (10.7%), which represented a new form of Seldes tear, was described. Cadavers with a labral tear had significantly higher alpha angles than other cadavers (53.29o vs 49.33o, p = 0.01). Pincer lesions were not associated with labral tears. We found no association between pincer or cam lesions and Seldes classification. Conclusion Cadavers presenting with higher alpha angles had a higher incidence of labral tears. No association was found between FAI and Seldes classification. Clinical relevance This study demonstrated a high prevalence of FAI abnormalities associated with histological alterations in a cadaveric sample. Joint damage may be present in the early stages of FAI."
https://openalex.org/W2809521736,"This study examined the association of anthropometric measures including height, leg length, trunk length and body mass index (BMI) at 11 and 18 years with systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) at 11 and 18 years. We analysed data from 661 participants from the Aboriginal Birth Cohort study-a longitudinal study based in the Northern Territory, Australia. Associations between anthropometric measures and cardiovascular risk factors were investigated in linear regression analyses adjusted for confounding, with imputation for missing data. In adjusted analyses, increasing leg length [males: 0.47mmHg/cm (0.23, 0.72); females: 0.50mmHg/cm (0.18, 0.83)], trunk length [males: 0.50mmHg/cm (0.28, 0.73); females: 0.57mmHg/cm (0.33, 0.81)] and height [males: 0.32mmHg/cm (0.16, 0.48); females: 0.32mmHg/cm (0.12, 0.52)] at 11 years was associated with higher SBP at 11 years. When these exposures were measured at 18 years the effect on SBP at 18 years had attenuated, and only increased trunk length was associated with higher SBP at 18 years for both sexes [males: 0.46mmHg/cm (0.05, 0.87); females: 0.69mmHg/cm (0.30, 1.08)]. We observed little association between height, leg length and trunk length and DBP, total cholesterol, LDL-c and HDL-c. Increased BMI was associated with elevated SBP and DBP at 11 and 18 years. Our findings suggest that height, leg length, and trunk length measured at 11 and 18 years was generally not associated with cardiovascular risk factors at 11 and 18 years. However, greater childhood BMI was associated with higher blood pressure and this association persisted into adolescence. This study contributes to the limited body of evidence on the association between measures of early anthropometry and cardiovascular risk among the Australian Aboriginal population."
https://openalex.org/W2809639137,"In this study, we investigated temporal changes in galanin receptor type 2 (GalR2) expression in NF200-, galanin-, neuropeptide Y (NPY)-, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS)-like immunoreactive (LI) dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after median nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI), and the effects of GalR2 on c-Fos expression in the cuneate nucleus (CN). Double immunofluorescence labeling methods were used to appraise changes in GalR2 expression in NF200-LI, galanin-LI, NPY-LI, and nNOS-LI DRG neurons after CCI. The von Frey assay was used to assess the efficiency of intraplantar administration of saline, M871 (a GalR2 antagonist), or AR-M1896 (a GalR2 agonist) on neuropathic signs of rats with CCI. The effects of alterations in c-Fos expression were assessed in all treatments. The percentage of GalR2-LI neurons in lesioned DRGs increased and peaked at 1 week after CCI. We further detected that percentages of GalR2-LI neurons labeled for NF200, galanin, NPY, and nNOS significantly increased following CCI. Furthermore, M871 remarkably attenuated tactile allodynia, but the sensation was slightly aggravated by AR-M1896 after CCI. Consequentially, after electrical stimulation of the CCI-treated median nerve, the number of c-Fos-LI neurons in the cuneate nucleus (CN) was significantly reduced in the M871 group, whereas it increased in the AR-M1896 group. These results suggest that activation of GalR2, probably through NPY or nitric oxide, induces c-Fos expression in the CN and transmits mechanical allodynia sensations to the thalamus."
https://openalex.org/W4206563395,"Understanding how regulatory elements control mammalian gene expression is a challenge of post-genomic era. We previously reported that size of proximal promoter architecture predicted the breadth of expression (fraction of tissues in which a gene is expressed). Herein, the contributions of individual transcription factors (TFs) were quantified. Several technologies of statistical modelling were utilized and compared: tree models, generalized linear models (GLMs, without and with regularization), Bayesian GLMs and random forest. Both linear and non-linear modelling strategies were explored. Encouragingly, different models led to similar statistical conclusions and biological interpretations. The majority of ENCODE TFs correlated positively with housekeeping expression, a minority correlated negatively. Thus, housekeeping expression can be understood as a cumulative effect of many types of TF binding sites. This is accompanied by the exclusion of fewer types of binding sites for TFs which are repressors, or support cell lineage commitment or temporarily inducible or spatially-restricted expression."
https://openalex.org/W2808834965,"Off-target oligoprobe's interaction with partially complementary nucleotide sequences represents a problem for many bio-techniques. The goal of the study was to identify oligoprobe sequence characteristics that control the ratio between on-target and off-target hybridization. To understand the complex interplay between specific and genome-wide off-target (cross-hybridization) signals, we analyzed a database derived from genomic comparison hybridization experiments performed with an Affymetrix tiling array. The database included two types of probes with signals derived from (i) a combination of specific signal and cross-hybridization and (ii) genomic cross-hybridization only. All probes from the database were grouped into bins according to their sequence characteristics, where both hybridization signals were averaged separately. For selection of specific probes, we analyzed the following sequence characteristics: vulnerability to self-folding, nucleotide composition bias, numbers of G nucleotides and GGG-blocks, and occurrence of probe's k-mers in the human genome. Increases in bin ranges for these characteristics are simultaneously accompanied by a decrease in hybridization specificity-the ratio between specific and cross-hybridization signals. However, both averaged hybridization signals exhibit growing trends along with an increase of probes' binding energy, where the hybridization specific signal increases significantly faster in comparison to the cross-hybridization. The same trend is evident for the S function, which serves as a combined evaluation of probe binding energy and occurrence of probe's k-mers in the genome. Application of S allows extracting a larger number of specific probes, as compared to using only binding energy. Thus, we showed that high values of specific and cross-hybridization signals are not mutually exclusive for probes with high values of binding energy and S. In this study, the application of a new set of sequence characteristics allows detection of probes that are highly specific to their targets for array design and other bio-techniques that require selection of specific probes."
https://openalex.org/W2809575588,"In this paper, we assess and map the risk that atmospheric nitrogen (atN) pollution poses to biodiversity in Natura 2000 sites in mainland Portugal. We first review the ecological impacts of atN pollution on terrestrial ecosystems, focusing on the biodiversity of Natura 2000 sites. These nature protection sites, especially those located within the Mediterranean Basin, are under-characterized regarding the risk posed by atN pollution. We focus on ammonia (NH3) because this N form is mostly associated with agriculture, which co-occurs at or in the immediate vicinity of most areas of conservation interest in Portugal. We produce a risk map integrating NH3 emissions and the susceptibility of Natura 2000 sites to atN pollution, ranking habitat sensitivity to atN pollution using expert knowledge from a panel of Portuguese ecological and habitat experts. Peats, mires, bogs, and similar acidic and oligotrophic habitats within Natura 2000 sites (most located in the northern mountains) were assessed to have the highest relative risk of biodiversity change due to atN pollution, whereas Natura 2000 sites in the Atlantic and Mediterranean climate zone (coastal, tidal, and scrubland habitats) were deemed the least sensitive. Overall, results allowed us to rank all Natura 2000 sites in mainland Portugal in order of evaluated risk posed by atN pollution. The approach is of great relevance for stakeholders in different countries to help prioritize site protection and to define research priorities. This is especially relevant in countries with a lack of expertise to assess the impacts of nitrogen on biodiversity and can represent an important step up from current knowledge in such countries."
https://openalex.org/W2808749218,"Chromatin insulators or boundary elements protect genes from regulatory activities from neighboring genes or chromatin domains. In the Drosophila Abdominal-B (Abd-B) locus, the deletion of such elements, such as Frontabdominal-7 (Fab-7) or Fab-8 led to dominant gain of function phenotypes, presumably due to the loss of chromatin barriers. Homologous chromosomes are paired in Drosophila, creating a number of pairing dependent phenomena including transvection, and whether transvection may affect the function of Polycomb response elements (PREs) and thus contribute to the phenotypes are not known. Here, we studied the chromatin barrier activity of Fab-8 and how it is affected by the zygosity of the transgene, and found that Fab-8 is able to block the silencing effect of the Ubx PRE on the DsRed reporter gene in a CTCF binding sites dependent manner. However, the blocking also depends on the zygosity of the transgene in that the barrier activity is present when the transgene is homozygous, but absent when the transgene is heterozygous. To analyze this effect, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) experiments on homozygous transgenic embryos, and found that H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 marks are restricted by Fab-8, but they spread beyond Fab-8 into the DsRed gene when the two CTCF binding sites within Fab-8 were mutated. Consistent with this, the mutation reduced H3K4me3 and RNA Pol II binding to the DsRed gene, and consequently, DsRed expression. Importantly, in heterozygous embryos, Fab-8 is unable to prevent the spread of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 marks from crossing Fab-8 into DsRed, suggesting an insulator bypass. These results suggest that in the Abd-B locus, deletion of the insulator in one copy of the chromosome could lead to the loss of insulator activity on the homologous chromosome, and in other loci where chromosomal deletion created hemizygous regions of the genome, the chromatin barrier could be compromised. This study highlights a role of homologous chromosome pairing in the regulation of gene expression in the Drosophila genome."
