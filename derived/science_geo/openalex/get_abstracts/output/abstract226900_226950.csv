https://openalex.org/W60061431,"Hydroxy-L-proline was first isolated by Fischer in 1902 from a hydrolysate of gelatin (l).l The synthesis and determination of the structure were reported by Leuchs and coworkers (5--g), and, in 1919, the separation of the two racemic stereoisomers and the resolution of each racemate through mixtures of quinine with the corresponding N-phenylisocyanate derivatives were accomplished (5). In the present nomenclature, [LY]~ for hydroxy-L-proline was -75.7”, for hydroxy-n-proline, +75.2”, for allohydroxy-L-proline, --5&l”, and for allohydroxy-n-proline, +58.6’ (5). Not only hydroxy-L-proline but also allohydroxy-L-proline occurs in nature, for the latter’ has been isolated by Wieland and Witkop from the toxic peptide of Amunita phalloides (10). The assignment of the L configuration to the allostereoisomer with [CLI]~ = -58.1” was due to the work of Neuberger, who converted hydroxy+ proline to allohydroxy-L-proline by inverting the configuration at Cd (3). This procedure involved the following steps: acetylation of the NH group of hydroxy-L-proline, esterification with diazomethane, formation of the 0-toluenesulfonyl ether at Cd by treatment of the N-acetyl-hydroxy-Lproline methyl ester with p-toluenesulfonyl chloride in dry pyridine solution, saponification of the carboxylic ester at low temperature, alkaline fission of the 0-toluenesulfonyl ether at high temperature (which is the"

https://openalex.org/W2120826296,"Numerous contributions have been made to our knowledge of the process of conjugation of phenol in vivo (2, 3). The studies in vitro are related to the formation of either phenyl sulfate (4-6) or glucuronide (7-11). Because of the great difference in behavior towards hydrolysis of the sulfate and the glucuronide (12), the formation of phenyl sulfate and phenyl glucuronide can be followed simultaneously. Our earlier demonstration (5) that a properly fortified homogenate can conjugate phenol with sulfate has been followed by further work on the properties of the system. Liver slices and homogenates conjugate phenol with both sulfuric and glucuronic acids, in agreement with the findings in vivo. The homogenates employed, fortified with 0.001"

https://openalex.org/W1997767075,"GUAVA is grown extensively in Uttar Pradesh and is a major fruit crop of the State, occupying nearly 70,000 acres of land. A wilt disease was first reported from the Allahabad district of the State1. This district is noted for its fine quality guavas and supplies a very large number of grafted plants from its nurseries to the rest of the country. The disease has advanced with great rapidity within a few years and has become a menace to successful cultivation of this valuable fruit in the eastern districts of the State. A rough estimate puts the area threatened by this disease at about 20,000 square miles."

https://openalex.org/W2087818184,"THE limitation to the value of the diagnostic procedure of examining bovine faeces for the larvae of Dictyocaulus viviparus has become increasingly clear during recent years. It has always been realized that immature worms would not reveal their presence in this way, and more recently the effect of host resistance has been recognized in reducing the rate of egg production by the female worms. A third source of error in attempting to diagnose parasitic bronchitis in cattle by faecal examinations has now come to our notice, in that we have found Dictyocaulus larvae invading the lungs of a partially resistant host, to be retarded in their development for some weeks and in some instances for months, and to constitute a possible source of disease that could not be detected by ordinary means even on post-mortem examination."

https://openalex.org/W1988426749,"IT may be of interest to record the occurrence of considerable numbers of the arctic Leptomedusan, Staurophora mertensii Brandt1, in the Firth of Clyde during the summer of 1951. Only two specimens have actually been examined; but reports were received on several occasions of medusæ described as having cruciform gonads of dark brown or black colour and 5–6 cm. in diameter when first seen at the end of May, increasing later to more than 15 cm. Since no other medusa with cruciform gonads exceeds about 5 cm. in diameter, there can be little doubt that these medusæ were Staurophora. From these reports it appears to have been common in the water around Bute and the Cumbraes from May to July; but it may have been more widely distributed, since one of the specimens examined was taken on May 30 ten miles south of Ailsa Craig, that is, nearly fortyfive miles south of Millport."

https://openalex.org/W2000813047,"IN the course of investigations on larval helminths while working in the University of Edinburgh, I found that Gammarus pulex (L.), which occurred abundantly throughout the year in the Braid Burn, near the Department of Zoology, harboured larval helminths of five different kinds—two species of Acanthocephala, Polymorphus minutus (Goeze) and Echinorhynchus truttœ Schrank, two species of cysticercoids new to science, and one form of plagiorchid metacercaria. So far as I am aware, this is the first record of a larval cestode infection in Gammarus pulex (L.) in Great Britain."
