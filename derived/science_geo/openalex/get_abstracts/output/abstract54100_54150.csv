https://openalex.org/W1581397464,"Abstract An adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of histone by ATP, has been purified from bovine brain and some of its properties have been studied. Under appropriate conditions, the activity of the enzyme was stimulated more than 20-fold by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, with an apparent Km for the cyclic nucleotide of about 2.5 x 10-7 m. The activation of the enzyme by adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate was associated with a decrease in Km of the enzyme for ATP that occurred in the presence of the cyclic nucleotide. In contrast, adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate had no significant effect on the Km of the enzyme for the histone. The optimum pH for the activity of the enzyme was 6.5. The purified enzyme had an absolute requirement for a divalent metal. The stimulation by cyclic AMP was greatest in the presence of Mg++, Mn++, or Co++. Cyclic AMP strongly inhibited enzyme activity in the presence of Ca++. The activation observed in the presence of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate was also observed with the 3',5'-monophosphate derivatives of inosine, guanosine, uridine, and cytidine as well as with dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate, but much higher concentrations of these other cyclic nucleotides were required. Deoxythymidine 3',5'-monophosphate, the only cyclic deoxyribonucleotide studied, was completely inactive. Adenosine and ADP were inhibitors of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1582521124,"Abstract A method for the assay of cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate has been applied to the determination of the nucleotide in tissues. Concentrations of cyclic GMP were determined in various tissues from several animal phyla. These levels were in most cases much lower than cyclic AMP, but an insect, the cricket, contained more cyclic GMP than cyclic AMP. Cyclic GMP was found in all rat tissues examined, and the upper small intestine contained relatively large amounts. The contents of the small intestine also were found to contain cyclic GMP, with that from the lower part containing more. Theophylline, an inhibitor of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, elevated the level of cyclic GMP in rat small intestine. This suggests a rapid turnover of the nucleotide in this tissue. An enzyme system which catalyzed the formation of cyclic GMP from GTP was demonstrated in small intestine. This enzyme required Mn++ for maximal activity and was inhibited by ATP. It was apparently different from adenyl cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1620075378,"Abstract An adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase preparation from liver catalyzes the phosphorylation of a specific serine residue in lysine-rich (f1) histone. Evidence, based on the isolation of electrophoretically and chromatographically identical tryptic phosphopeptides from f1 histone phosphorylated in vivo and in vitro, indicates that phosphorylation of this serine residue occurs in rat liver in vivo and is increased 8- and 20-fold, respectively, by intraperitoneal injections of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and N6,O2'-dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Thus histones appear to serve as substrates in vivo for the adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate-dependent protein kinase of liver."

https://openalex.org/W1548772486,"Abstract Cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) overcomes the repression by glucose of the synthesis of the following inducible enzymes and proteins in Escherichia coli: β-galactosidase, lac permease, galactokinase, glycerokinase, l-α-glycerophosphate permease, Enzyme II for fructose of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system, l-arabinose permease, tryptophanase, d-serine deaminase, and thymidine phosphorylase. Cyclic AMP overcomes the repression by glucose of the synthesis of β-galactosidase in Serratia marcescens F lac, Salmonella typhimurium F lac, Proteus inconstans P lac, and Aerobacter aerogenes; it also overcomes the repression by glucose of galactokinase synthesis in S. typhimurium. A number of analogues of cyclic AMP failed to mimic or inhibit the action of the cyclic nucleotide on β-galactosidase synthesis. Since glucose lowers the intracellular concentration of cyclic AMP in E. coli, we propose that the intracellular level of cyclic AMP regulates the rate of synthesis of many inducible enzymes in E. coli and other microorganisms and that glucose lowers the rate of synthesis of these enzymes by decreasing the intracellular level of cyclic AMP."
https://openalex.org/W2116453093,"Abstract Incubation of fat cells with trypsin (1 mg per ml) for 1 min at 37° in the presence of serum albumin (20 mg per ml) caused a marked stimulation of glucose transport (an insulinlike effect). When the incubation was continued for 15 min, however, the insulin-like effect disappeared and insulin itself (added after neutralization of the enzyme with soybean trypsin inhibitor) failed to stimulate glucose transport and inhibit lipolysis in the cells. Cells rendered unresponsive to insulin still maintained normal levels of ATP, lactate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, and retained the capacity to oxidize glucose rapidly. The glucose transport system of treated cells maintained the normal sensitivity to specific inhibitors and to variations of the external glucose concentration. The lipolytic system of the cell remained highly responsive to epinephrine and adrenocorticotropic hormone, but the responsiveness of the system to glucagon was abolished entirely. When trypsin-treated cells were kept at 37° for more than 30 min after inactivation of the enzyme, the insulin responsiveness returned progressively, reaching 60 to 80% of the control in 60 min. This recovery was inhibited by 0.1 mm puromycin or 0.01 mm cycloheximide. Recovered activity could be abolished again by a second trypsin treatment. In contrast, the responsiveness to glucagon was not restored in 2 hours. These results indicate that trypsin modifies rather selectively the effector systems for insulin and glucagon without affecting other metabolic systems of the cell, including the effector systems for epinephrine and adrenocorticotropic hormone. It is suggested that an essential part of the insulin-effector system is a rapidly renewable peptide element located on the surface of the cell, and that an initial action of trypsin on the system mimics the effect of insulin while subsequent proteolytic modification of the system renders the cells unresponsive to the hormone."

https://openalex.org/W1516849527,"Abstract The urinary excretion of cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate has been studied in rats in various hormonal states. Hypophysectomy lowered the excretion of cyclic GMP to less than half of normal while reducing only slightly the excretion of cyclic AMP. The effect of the operation on cyclic GMP excretion was not associated with a decrease in the nucleotide content of the whole animal. The effect of hypophysectomy on cyclic AMP excretion was completely reversed by hydrocortisone while cyclic GMP excretion was unaffected by the hormone. A large dose of thyroxine in combination with hydrocortisone completely reversed the effect of hypophysectomy on cyclic GMP, but a more nearly physiological dose of thyroxine with hydrocortisone was only partially effective. A mixture of six purified anterior pituitary hormones completely reversed the effect of hypophysectomy on cyclic GMP excretion. Cyclic GMP excretion was lowered by adrenalectomy and restored to normal by hydrocortisone. Thyroparathyroidectomy also decreased the excretion of cyclic GMP, and this was reversed by maintenance doses of thyroxine. Cyclic AMP excretion was not demonstrably affected by adrenalectomy but was lowered by thyroparathyroidectomy and restored to near normal by thyroxine. The injection of glucagon produced a marked increase in cyclic AMP excretion while having no effect on cyclic GMP excretion. Excretion of both nucleotides relative to body weight was lower in old than young animals and appeared to be independent of the urine volume. When urine was collected for 2 consecutive days, nucleotide excretion was consistently lower during the 2nd day. Relative to the levels of the two nucleotides contained in the whole normal animal, proportionately more cyclic GMP than cyclic AMP was excreted, and the amounts of both nucleotides excreted in a day exceeded the total body content as measured at one point in time."

https://openalex.org/W1567207659,"Abstract RNA polymerase directed by d(A-T) carries out an active exchange of 32PPi into UTP in the presence of catalytic amounts of ATP. In reactions directed by d(I-C), an active exchange of 32PPi into CTP is absolutely dependent on GTP. In the d(A-T)-directed 32PP-UTP exchange reaction, ATP can be replaced (with varying efficiency) by adenosine tetraphosphate, ADP, 5'-AMP and AMP 5'-morpholidate, but not by 2',3'-AMP or cyclic 3',5'-AMP. Only UTP, and not UDP or dUTP, will accept 32PP in the exchange reaction. A model for RNA polymerase is proposed where the initiating purine triphosphate binds to the product terminus site and the pyrimidine triphosphate engaging in PPi exchange binds to the substrate site. 32PPi exchange is the result of a polymerization step followed by pyrophosphorolysis by 32PPi prior to translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1528158863,"Abstract Anaerobic reductive titrations with solid dithionite were carried out on seven iron-sulfur proteins. Of these, six were of the plant ferredoxin type with 2 iron and 2 labile sulfur atoms per molecule in the molecular weight range of from 12,000 to 25,000. In addition, the high potential iron protein of Chromatium with 4 iron and labile sulfur atoms per molecule was titrated. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and in most cases also the optical spectra were measured as titration progressed. In the ferredoxin group of proteins the end point was determined by maximal development of the characteristic EPR signal (g⊥ ≈ 1.94; g|| ≈ 2.0) of the reduced forms and maximal bleaching of color. With the protein from Chromatium, disappearance of the EPR signal at g = 2 of the oxidized form indicated the end point. By these criteria it was found that in every instance 1 electron is taken up per molecule of protein, i.e. 1 electron/2 iron atoms by the ferredoxin-type compounds and 1 electron/4 iron atoms by the Chromatium protein. On double integration of the EPR signals recorded at temperatures between 30 and 80° K, the reducing equivalents taken up by these proteins could be accounted for quantitatively. These findings are in agreement with the results of other approaches which indicate that these proteins have a 2-iron center which is able to accommodate 1 additional electron on reduction."
https://openalex.org/W1501842543,Abstract The composition of gangliosides and their synthesis in a chemically-induced rat hepatoma cell line differ from the composition and synthesis seen in a nontumorigenic rat hepatocyte cell line. The alteration in gangliosides is characterized by a decrease in disialoceramide tetrahexoside ganglioside and an increase in monosialoceramide lactoside (hematoside) and monosialoceramide tetrahexoside. The change resembles the altered pattern of gangliosides which occurs in mouse cell lines after transformation with oncogenic DNA viruses.

https://openalex.org/W1501096338,"Abstract Glucose and α-methyl glucoside repress β-galactosidase synthesis in wild type Escherichia coli and in mutant strains deficient in Enzyme I or in the heat-stable protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system. Although the mutants do not grow on glucose and accumulate only a small amount of α-methyl glucoside, they are more sensitive to repression by these compounds than are their parent strains. This repression is presumably due to the lowering of the intracellular concentration of cyclic 3',5'-AMP by glucose and α-methyl glucoside, since it can be prevented by addition of the nucleotide. In contrast, a mutant deficient in glucose Enzyme II activity was resistant to repression by glucose and α-methyl glucoside. Evidently, the repression of β-galactosidase synthesis by these sugars does not require phosphorylation by the P-enolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system. It does, however, require the presence of Enzyme II activity for the sugars. An Enzyme I mutant and a heat-stable protein mutant which did not grow on lactose would grow on lactose in the presence of cyclic 3',5'-AMP or of isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside. Therefore, an intact P-enolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system is not required for lactose utilization by E. coli."

https://openalex.org/W1524329010,"Abstract Silicotungstate was found to remove the inner membrane spheres from submitochondrial particles derived from bovine heart. Both particulate and soluble ATPase were shown to be rapidly inactivated in the presence of low concentrations of silicotungstate. A simple and reproducible procedure for the preparation of deficient submitochondrial particles by treatment with silicotungstate was developed. These particles were resolved with respect to all known coupling factors as well as with respect to succinate dehydrogenase. Addition of reconstitutively active succinate dehydrogenase together with F1, F2, F3, and F5 restored oxidative phosphorylation with succinate as substrate. Addition of a succinate dehydrogenase preparation was required also for reconstitution of phosphorylation associated with the oxidation of DPNH or 32Pi-ATP exchange activity. This effect is due to the presence of a new coupling factor in the preparation."
https://openalex.org/W135567997,"Abstract Cytochrome c is swiftly and quantitatively reduced by chromous ion. In the course of the reduction chromium is bound to the protein. At pH 4.78 and 7.0 the ratio of chromium to cytochrome c is approximately 0.5 mole per mole. When phosphate is present during the reduction, the ratio increases to approximately unity, and 1 mole of phosphate is also bound. The chromium-ferrocytochrome c complex can be reoxidized with ferricyanide with little loss of chromium and can be reduced again with dithionite. However, if chromous ion is used to reduce ferricytochrome c-chromium, only partial reduction occurs. The cytochrome c-chromium-phosphate complex is active with cytochrome oxidase and with the cytochrome c reductase of a bovine heart submitochondrial preparation. In the latter system, however, rates are markedly lower. The cytochrome c-chromium-phosphate complex has been digested with pepsin, and a crude fraction has been isolated which still contains iron, chromium, and phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1533780298,"Abstract A new simplified procedure for preparation of micrococcal nuclease (Staphylococcus aureus strain foggi) in good yield is described. The method consists of (a) chromatography on carboxymethyl cellulose, (b) fractionation with ammonium sulfate, (c) gel filtration on Bio-Gel P-100, and (d) chromatography on phosphocellulose. The product obtained contains no more than 2 x 10-6 unit of monophosphatase per unit of nuclease. Specific activity of nuclease across the chromatographic peak of the last step is constant. In agreement with other laboratories, the purified nuclease shows one major and one minor band on acrylamide gel electrophoresis. When this preparation of micrococcal nuclease was used in concentrations approaching saturation, deoxyribodinucleotides, which up until now have been considered resistant, were all digested. Of 12 dinucleotides of the type d-NpNp, the most susceptible was d-TpTp, the most resistant d-TpGp. The extremes in susceptibility are of the order of 100-fold and depend primarily on the base in the β position. Dinucleoside monophosphates are also digestible but are more resistant than their 3'-monophosphoryl analogues. The 5'-dinucleotides are the most resistant of all. The magnitude of inhibition by 5'- and of enhancement by 3'-phosphoryl groups is no greater than the effect exerted by the base."

One system, which is soluble, yields products of chain length shorter than the 55-carbon isoprenoid antigen carrier lipid. The other, which is found in particulate fractions, yields a product that after acid hydrolysis is identical with the hydrolyzed antigen carrier lipid. This latter product is able to react with the sugar nucleotides UDP-galactose and TDP-rhamnose to form a disaccharide-diphosphate-polyprenol identical with disaccharide diphosphate antigen carrier lipid on diethylaminoethyl cellulose. It is proposed that the antigen carrier lipid is formed by the particulate enzyme through successive additions of Δ3-isopentenyl pyrophosphate to farnesyl pyrophosphate."

https://openalex.org/W1515912776,"Abstract Highly resolved submitochondrial particles (ASU-particles) required coupling factors 1, 2, 3, and 5 (F1, F2, F3, and F5) for optimal rates of phosphorylation associated with oxidation of DPNH and for the 32Pi-ATP exchange. The ATP-dependent reduction of DPN by succinate required, in addition to coupling factors, exposure of ASU-particles to minute amounts of DPNH for maximal activity. After treatment with DPNH, the particles became sensitized to inhibition by low concentrations of mersalyl. For optimal rates of DPN reduction by succinate and for the reduction of TPN by DPNH driven by oxidative energy, addition of F1 as well as rutamycin was needed. An antibody against F1 did not inhibit these reductive processes, indicating that F1 was required as a structural component."
https://openalex.org/W1530255777,"Abstract Rates of formation and dissociation of an abortive ternary complex between lactate dehydrogenase isozymes from various mammalian tissues, NAD+, and pyruvate were studied utilizing stopped-flow spectrofluorometry. Formation of the complex was accompanied by a decrease in protein fluorescence at 340 mµ and a loss of lactate dehydrogenase activity. Rates of formation of an abortive lactate dehydrogenase-1 and lactate dehydrogenase-5 complex were compared at 25° and 40° over a range of pyruvate and enzyme concentrations, at two NAD+ concentrations, and with two coenzyme analogues. Dialysis against buffer produced an increase in protein fluorescence and recovery of lactate dehydrogenase activity that suggested dissociation of the abortive complex. At pyruvate concentrations of 0.3 mm the abortive ternary complex formed twice as fast with lactate dehydrogenase-1 as with lactate dehydrogenase-5 and with 40.0 mm pyruvate it formed 5 times faster. The rate of complex formation increased with both isozymes when pyruvate concentrations were raised from 0.3 mm to 40.0 mm and when the temperature was elevated from 25° to 40°. However, the rates of abortive complex formation were inversely related to enzyme concentration. Compared to lactate dehydrogenase turnover numbers, the rates of formation of the abortive ternary complex were slow. Under physiological conditions of temperature (40°) and pyruvate concentration (0.3 to 1.0 mm), half the maximum fluorescence quenching required approximately 50 sec for partially purified lactate dehydrogenase-1. Changes in coenzyme concentration from 0.10 mm to 0.75 mm failed to alter the rates of abortive complex formation. With the 3-acetylpyridine analogue of NAD+, rates of abortive complex formation for both lactate dehydrogenase-1 and lactate dehydrogenase-5 were similar, whereas with deamino-NAD+ the abortive complex formed faster with lactate dehydrogenase-1 than with lactate dehydrogenase-5. Dialysis of the abortive complex resulted in recovery of enzyme activity; the rate of recovery was faster with lactate dehydrogenase-5 than with lactate dehydrogenase-1. The stopped-flow spectrophotofluorometer permitted measurement of lactate dehydrogenase activity at enzyme concentrations approaching those in tissue. At lactate dehydrogenase-1 concentrations of 3.5 x 10-6 m or 3.5 x 10-7 m no substrate inhibition was detected with pyruvate concentrations up to 20.0 mm, whereas with enzyme levels at and below 1.8 x 10-7 m, substrate inhibition appeared at pyruvate concentrations greater than 1.0 mm."

The synthetic enzyme containing the spin-labeled heme had optical properties similar to those of the enzymes containing protoheme dialkyl esters. The enzyme formed well defined complexes with fluoride, azide, and cyanide, and reacted with hydrogen peroxide to form a peroxide intermediate (Complex ES). The reduced enzyme reacted with CO to form a CO complex. The enzymic activity of the synthetic enzyme was, however, of the order of 1% of the native enzyme. The synthetic cytochrome c peroxidase containing spin-labeled protoheme showed an electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of strongly immobilized label, while spin-labeled protohemin showed only weak immobilization. On addition of hydrogen peroxide or azide, the degree of immobilization was further enhanced but it was diminished on binding with cyanide. These changes were reversible, because the original spectra were obtained by removal of the ligands. Fluoride had no effect on the electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum of the enzyme. From these results it was concluded that the interaction of the heme to the protein was altered by ligand binding."

https://openalex.org/W1490580367,"Abstract Two kinds of NADH dehydrogenase, NADH:heme protein oxidoreductase (Enzyme I) (mol wt, 33,000) and NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (Enzyme II) (mol wt, 26,000) have been prepared in a homogeneous state from light-grown Rhodospirillum rubrum and characterized. Both flavin-free proteins are activated by flavins. In the presence of added flavin, Enzyme I catalyzes the reduction by NADH of cytochrome cc', cytochrome c2, quinones (ubiquinone-10, etc.), and oxidation-reduction dyes such as 2,6-dichloroindophenol at approximately identical rates, whereas II catalyzes the reduction of quinones and dyes much faster than the reduction of cytochromes. For Enzyme I, the maximum rates attained with the flavins riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide, and flavin adenine dinucleotide are in the ratio 2:1.5:1, respectively, with Km ≃ 1 µm for all three flavins. In the presence of the latter two flavins, a 4-fold excess of FAD over FMN is sufficient to depress completely the reaction rate to that observed with FAD alone. For Enzyme II, the maximum rate with FMN is twice that with FAD or riboflavin, with Km = 0.3 µm for FMN. Enzyme II has greater affinity for FMN than for FAD, because the reaction rate of the FMN-activated enzyme is not decreased by addition of as much as 10-fold excess FAD. The oxidation of NADH by oxygen catalyzed by Enzyme I is completely inhibited by ferricytochrome c2, which is preferentially reduced. At alkaline pH, cytochrome cc' stimulates the oxidation of NADH by oxygen. R. rubrum chromatophores contain two kinds of bound cytochrome-560; one is reduced by NADH, the other is reduced by succinate. By depletion of the chromatophores of Enzyme I, the extent of reduction of the first cytochrome by NADH is markedly depressed. The reaction is restored to the maximal level when purified Enzyme I is added, which suggests that the enzyme is functional in the reduction of the NADH-reducible cytochrome via a flavin associated with the chromatophores."

https://openalex.org/W1552121605,"Abstract The effects of substrate and AMP on the state of ionization of tyrosyl residues of fructose 1,6-diphosphatase have been investigated. In the native enzyme, 5 to 6 tyrosyl residues were titrated with a pK of about 8.4, and 7 to 8 residues were titrated with a pK of 9 to 9.2. The remaining tyrosyl residues were not titrated below pH 10. In the presence of 10-5 m fructose 1,6-diphosphate, when 4 moles of substrate are bound per mole of enzyme, approximately 4 of the low pK tyrosyl residues are shifted from pK 8.4 to pK 9.7. However, all of the pK values are modified, and under these conditions 2 tyrosyl residues show a pK of 8.7, and 10 or 11 residues show a pK of 9.7. At a high concentration of fructose 1,6-diphosphate, 10-3 m, all 12 to 13 of the tyrosyl residues are titrated with a pK of 9.8. The results can be correlated with previous studies on the acetylation of fructose 1,6-diphosphatase. The tyrosyl residues with low pK are more reactive and are associated with loss of sensitivity to AMP. However, after acetylation, only 10 tyrosyl residues are titrated with a pK of 9.3 to 9.4, and the pK is shifted to 9.7 when the substrate is bound. A method of analyzing the titration data is presented which permits simultaneous evaluation of number of residues and pK value of each titrated group. This has revealed changes in tyrosyl residues that would otherwise have been overlooked."

The isolated replicating structures contain both single- and double-stranded RNA. We have digested away the double-stranded portions with E. coli ribonuclease III and have studied the properties of the purified nascent single strands. They resemble incomplete viral RNA by the criterion of annealing as well as by enzymatic and chromatographic tests. End group analysis of the isolated nascent phage RNA shows it to contain the same 5' end group present in intact RNA isolated from phage particles. Since this end group is the guanosine tetraphosphate, viral strands are synthesized in a 5' to 3' direction. The average size of a nascent strand was determined by measuring the ratio of 5'-terminal phosphate to internal phosphate, and comparing this ratio to that obtained from intact phage RNA. The nascent strands average 0.25 of a full length strand, shorter than the size expected were RNA synthesized at a constant rate. This finding may reflect one way in which the phage controls the availability of its cistrons for translation in the infected cell."

A continuous train of pairs of brief pulses was delivered to pain systems in the midbrain. Rate of lever pressing to achieve 3-second rests from this stimulation was measured as a function of the interval separating the pulses within pairs. Evidence for latent addition, absolute refractory period, temporal summation, and adaptation was demonstrated. Obtained relationships suggested that three sets of fibers may carry the aversive signal and that synaptic integration of pain in the brain may be related to Stevens' power law functions."

The binding of 2 eq of DDPM reduces activity with histidinol and histidinal as substrate to 25 and 42% of their respective initial values. Binding of 4 eq of CMB reduces activity with histidinol as the substrate to 25% of its initial value although activity measured with histidinal is not decreased. Enzymatic activity measured with histidinol as the substrate decreases as a linear function of the concentration of CMB or DDPM added, but neither reagent can totally inactivate the enzyme. During the binding of 4 eq of mercuribenzoate the rate of mercaptide bond formation appears to be proportional to the rate of inactivation measured with histidinol as the substrate. We conclude that the addition of CMB produces a uniform differential inactivation of all enzyme molecules rather than the complete inactivation of a portion of the molecules. Apparent Km values for histidinol and histidinal do not change upon differential inactivation. However, LineweaverBurk plots of velocity with respect to DPN concentration with either substrate in excess, while linear with the native enzyme, are concave downward for differentially inactivated enzyme. These effects may be due to (a) the presence of nonidentical active sites; (b) negative cooperativity between multiple active sites; or (c) an alteration in the normal reaction mechanism."
