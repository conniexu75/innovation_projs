The use of these data for the identification of ketohexoses and 6-desoxyaldohexoses has been pointed out, as has their application to the quantitative determination of certain monosaccharides when present singly or in admixture with other monosaccharides, either as the monosaccharides or as components of oligosaccharides and polysaccharides."

https://openalex.org/W4245896481,"WE have read with interest Mr. R. C. Brimley's letter in Nature of February 5, p. 215. There are two points at which its treatment requires to be amplified. In the first place, he appears to assume diffusion to be the sole agency distributing the substance of the spot around its centre, and ignores entirely the effect of partition of the substance between aqueous and non-aqueous phases. The elementary theory of partition chromatography1 or of counter-current extraction2 leads to the expectation that, even in the absence of diffusion, a substance originally located within the confines of a single plate of the chromatogram will, when the chromatogram is developed, be distributed through all the plates of the chromatogram in accordance with a binomial distribution of high index, which can be approximated by a normal distribution along the direction of flow."

It has recently come into prominence in the discovery of strains of Drosophila sensitive and resistant to carbon dioxide (reviewed by l'Heritier1). In using carbon dioxide as a means of temporarily immobilizing aquatic invertebrates for extraction of blood samples, we have been struck by some remarkable interspecific differences in sensitivity and have been led to investigate the problem."

https://openalex.org/W2072000591,"STUDIES in this laboratory on the morphogenesis of leaves have disclosed that successive leaves of Ipomœa differ consistently in cell size, cell number and shape1,2. The differences do not merely reflect changes in the external environment, but are clearly due to changes associated with the ageing of the apical meristem3. We now have evidence that in Lemna minor there is a similar ageing of the meristem. It is revealed by a progressive diminution in area of successive ‘daughter’ fronds from a ‘mother’ frond, even when the colony is grown in a constant external environment4. In the strain we are using, each frond produces on an average four or five ‘daughter’ fronds and then dies. In a typical experiment the mean area of the mother frond was 5·1 mm.2, and its expectation of life was 36 days. The areas, and expectations of life, of its five daughter fronds were respectively 5·13 mm.2 and 33 days; 3·84 mm.2 and 30 days; 3·33 mm.2 and 28 days ; 1·04 mm.2 and 18 days ; and for the fifth, 1·10 mm.2 and 10 days. Despite this evidence of senescence, the mean area of fronds in a colony of Lemna does not diminish. This is because senescence is accompanied by rejuvenation. An impoverished fifth daughter frond is about one-fifth the area of its mother frond ; but it in its turn produces daughter fronds much larger than itself, and so the mean area of fronds in the colony is maintained."

It possesses only a low fungicidal activity. Anderson and Sherrard1 attributed to this acid the structure I, which is closely related to that of perillic acid, mainly on account of its easy conversion to cuminic acid (II) with dilute hydrochloric acid."

The results obtained are probably typical of ruminants and have been confirmed to some extent for the sheep1–3. A further investigation of globulin absorption is reported here. It is mainly concerned with the immune globulin content of colostrum, the effect of delayed ingestion of colostrum on the lambs' serum proteins and the presence of proteins in the lambs' urine."

https://openalex.org/W2032377827,"RECENTLY1,2 we described the inhibitory effect of the trypanocidal drug, suramin, on certain enzymes. Hexokinase, urease, yeast decarboxylase, succinic dehydrogenase and trypsin are all strongly inhibited by concentrations of suramin similar to those maintained in the blood plasma of man and other animals for at least several hours after the intravenous injection of a normal dose (1–2 gm.) of the drug. For example, M/10,000 and M/20,000 suramin give respectively 100 and 75 per cent inhibition of the action of hexokinase, and, with low substrate concentrations, M/10,000 suramin inhibits the hydrolysis of casein by trypsin to the extent of 56 per cent."

Although a general method has been developed for the synthesis of pyridine and quinoline cyclic hydroxamic acids1, attempts to apply this method in order to effect a synthesis of a pyrazine cyclic hydroxamic acid have been unsuccessful, peroxidation of a 2-substituted pyrazine giving the 4-oxide and not the required 1-oxide2. We now describe two syntheses of pyrazine cyclic hydroxamic acids starting from α-aminohydroxamic acids (II), which are readily obtained by the action of hydroxylamine on αamino-esters."

https://openalex.org/W2894641150,"SEVERAL years ago we prepared by dehydration of 3(β)-acetoxycholestan-7(α)-ol (then provisionally termed 7β) a slightly dextrorotatory product which we proved to consist essentially of Δ7-cholesten-3(β)-yl acetate (Δ-cholestenyl acetate)1. Taking exception to this view, Plattner, Heusser, Troxler and Segre2 have recently ascribed this structure to a læ vorotatory substance, m.p. 104–105°, [α]D14—64° in chloroform, which they prepared from the same starting material by pyrolysis of its 7-benzoate. In repeating and extending the work of the Swiss authors, we have found that this substance is in reality Δ6-cholesten-3(β)-yl acetate. Our purest specimen of the compound melted at 104–106° and showed [α]D24—88°. It was hydrolysed to Δ6-cholesten-3(α)-ol, m.p. 118–119°, after drying at 100°, 129–131°, [α]D25—81°, and the latter converted into the benzoate, m.p. 128–129°, [α]D24—74° (all rotations in chloroform, unless otherwise indicated)."
