https://openalex.org/W1584683177,"The 60-amino acid long homeodomain of Antennapedia crosses biological membranes by an energy-independent mechanism, a phenomenon abolished by directed mutagenesis within the polypeptide C-terminal region. This finding led us to study the internalization of several chemically synthesized peptides derived from the third helix of the homeodomain. We report here that a polypeptide of 16 amino acids in length corresponding to the third helix of the homeodomain deleted of its N-terminal glutamate is still capable of translocating through the membrane. A longer peptide of 20 amino acids also translocates, whereas shorter peptides (15 amino acids) are not internalized by the cells. As is also the case for the entire homeodomain, the 20- and 16-amino acid long peptides are internalized at 4 degrees C, suggesting an energy-independent mechanism of translocation not involving classical endocytosis. The two translocated peptides can be recovered, intact, within the cells, strongly suggesting that they are not targeted to the lysosomal compartment. Finally, substitution of two tryptophans by two phenylalanines strongly diminishes translocation, raising the possibility that the internalization of the third helix is not solely based on its general hydrophobicity."
https://openalex.org/W1538891740,"Approximately 50% of Helicobacter pylori isolates produce a cytotoxin in vitro that induces vacuolation of eukaryotic cells. Screening a lambda ZapII library of H. pylori 60190 chromosomal fragments permitted the identification of a 3864-base pair (bp) open reading frame (vacA) that encoded the vacuolating cytotoxin, and a > or = 567-bp upstream gene that was homologous to Escherichia coli cysteinyl-tRNA synthetase. The sequence data suggest that a 33-amino-acid leader sequence and a C-terminal peptide are cleaved from a 139-kDa protoxin to yield the mature 87-kDa cytotoxin. The vacA gene product contains a C-terminal motif that is present in several other bacterial proteins that undergo C-terminal cleavage, including IgA proteases of Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Isogenic H. pylori mutants with insertional mutation of the vacA gene lacked vacuolating cytotoxin activity and failed to produce the 87-kDa protein. Southern analysis of naturally occurring tox-H. pylori strains with vacA probes indicated the presence of hybridizing bands, but both Southern analysis and polymerase chain reaction studies suggested that the vacA sequences of tox- strains differed from those of tox+ strains. Sequence analysis of a 1541-bp region of polymerase chain reaction-amplified vacA from tox- strain 87-203 indicated 64.8% amino acid identity with the corresponding region from tox+ strain 60190. Thus, sequence divergence in vacA genes may explain the lack of functionally active cytotoxin production by some H. pylori isolates."
https://openalex.org/W2068379293,"The protein receptor for Clostridium botulinum type B neurotoxin was purified 340-fold from rat synaptosomes by successive chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, phenyl-Toyopearl, and heparin-Toyopearl columns. 125I-Labeled neurotoxin bound to lipid vesicles containing the protein receptor and ganglioside GT1b or GD1a. The reconstituted receptor showed the same affinities as the native receptor on synaptosomes. Chemical cross-linking of 125I-toxin to the receptor in the presence of gangliosides resulted in formation of a cross-linked product of 161 kDa under reducing conditions. Cross-linking was specific, as it was inhibited by the presence of excess unlabeled toxin. A monoclonal antibody against the purified 58-kDa receptor protein and a monoclonal antibody against the heavy chain (103 kDa) of the neurotoxin reacted with the cross-linked product of 161 kDa in immunoblotting experiments. We determined partial amino acid sequences of the 58-kDa protein, which were identical to synaptotagmin, a synaptic vesicle membrane protein. In addition, the monoclonal antibody against the 58-kDa receptor protein recognized recombinant rat synaptotagmin. These results suggest that synaptotagmin in association with ganglioside GT1b or GD1a may be a natural receptor for C. botulinum type B neurotoxin at the nerve terminals."
https://openalex.org/W1591599721,"The 5'-flanking region of the rat vitamin D3 24-hydroxylase (P450cc24) gene was examined and a vitamin D-responsive element (VDRE) responsible for the 1 alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25-(OH)2D3) enhancement was identified. Unidirectional deletion analyses of the 5'-flanking region indicated that the region [-167/-102] is involved in vitamin D responsiveness. Further functional analyses showed that the segment [-204/-129] conferred the hormone responsiveness in an orientation-independent manner when it was placed upstream to the heterologous thymidine kinase promoter or the rabbit beta-globin promoter. The segment [-204/-129] contained two direct repeat motifs homologous to other VDREs found in the osteocalcin and osteopontin genes. Synthetic oligonucleotides containing the putative VDRE were used for functional analyses and gel mobility shift assays. The proximal [-151/-137], but not the distal [-169/-155] direct repeat activated the transcription in response to 1,25-(OH)2D3 through the beta-globin promoter. Furthermore, the proximal direct repeat formed a complex with the vitamin D receptor and a nuclear accessory factor(s) from COS cells (or retinoid X receptor) in the presence of 1,25-(OH)2D3. These results indicate that a direct repeat motif, AGGTGAgt-gAGGGCG, located at -151 base pairs upstream in the antisense strand binds to a heterologous dimer consisting of the VDR occupied with 1,25-(OH)2D3 and the nuclear accessory factor and that it plays a critical role in mediating the vitamin D enhancement of the rat P450cc24 gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1481760785,"Unlike the muscle protein, alpha-tropomyosin expressed in Escherichia coli does not bind actin, does not exhibit head-to-tail polymerization, and does not inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity in the absence of troponin. The only chemical difference between recombinant and muscle tropomyosins is that the first methionine is not acetylated in the recombinant protein (Hitchcock-De-Gregori, S.E., and Heald, R. W. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 9730-9735). We expressed three fusion tropomyosins in E. coli with 2, 3, and 17 amino acids fused to its amino terminus. All three fusions restored actin binding, head-to-tail polymerization, and the capacity to inhibit the actomyosin ATPase to these unacetylated tropomyosins. Unlike larger fusions, the small fusions of 2 and 3 amino acids do not interfere with regulatory function. Therefore the presence of a fused dipeptide at the amino terminus of unacetylated tropomyosin is sufficient to replace the function of the N-acetyl group present in muscle tropomyosin. A structural interpretation for the function of the acetyl group, based on our results and the coiled coil structure of tropomyosin, is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1595381086,"Clostridium difficile toxin B exhibits cytotoxic activity that is characterized by the disruption of the microfilamental cytoskeleton. Here we studied whether the GTP-binding Rho protein, which reportedly participates in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, is involved in the toxin action. Toxin B treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells reveals a time- and concentration-dependent decrease in the ADP-ribosylation of Rho by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme in the cell lysate. Disruption of the microfilament system induced by C. botulinum C2 toxin or cytochalasin D does not cause impaired ADP-ribosylation of Rho. Toxin B exhibits its effects on Rho not only in intact cells but also when added to cell lysates. Besides endogenous Rho, RhoA-glutathione S-transferase (Rho-GST) fusion protein added to cell lysate showed decreased ADP-ribosylation after toxin B treatment. Immunoblot analysis reveals identical amounts of Rho-GST and no change in molecular mass after toxin B treatment compared with controls. ADP-ribosylation of Rho-GST purified from toxin B-treated cell lysate is inhibited, indicating a modification of Rho itself. Finally, transfection of rhoA DNA under the control of a strong promoter into cells protects them from the activity of toxin B. Altogether, the data indicate that C. difficile toxin B acts directly or indirectly on Rho proteins to inhibit ADP-ribosylation and suggest that the cytotoxic effect of toxin B involves Rho."
https://openalex.org/W1567005075,"ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) is a 21-kDa GTP binding protein that regulates eukaryotic membrane traffic. Both the binding and hydrolysis of GTP by ARF have been shown to be necessary for this function. However, purified mammalian ARF lacks intrinsic GTPase activity ( 100-fold purification of ARF GAP, making it, likely, an inherent property of this reaction. PIP2 alone stimulated ARF GAP activity up to 30-fold with a half-maximal effect at 100-300 microM but had no effect on the GTPase rate of ARF alone. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate was also active but had only 50% of the maximal effect and twice the EC50 of PIP2. Phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, and diacylglycerol either alone or in the presence of ARF GAP do not stimulate ARF GTPase activity. ARF proteins have been identified recently as regulators of phospholipase D. The product of the phospholipase D reaction, phosphatidic acid, stimulated ARF GAP approximately 5-fold and reduced the PIP2 concentration needed for GAP stimulation about 6-fold. The substrate of phospholipase D, phosphatidylcholine, inhibited ARF GAP activity, but this inhibition seen with phosphatidylcholine was partially reversed by phosphatidic acid. A feedback loop for the coordinate regulation of phospholipase D and ARF activities is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1523684384,"Insulin stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) and She in Rat1 fibroblasts overexpressing wild type insulin receptors. We investigated the relative role of IRS-1 and She in insulin activation of guanine nucleotide releasing factor (GNRF) and p21ras-GTP formation. The time course of insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was rapid, whereas Shc phosphorylation was relatively slow. Growth factor receptor bound protein-2 (Grb2) associated with IRS-1 rapidly and gradually dissociated after 5 min, whereas Grb2 association with Shc was slower and reached a maximum at 10 min after insulin stimulation. Thus, the kinetics of Grb2 association with IRS-1 and She corresponded closely to the time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Shc, respectively. Importantly, 3-13-fold more Grb2 was associated with Shc than with IRS-1. In addition, the kinetics of insulin-stimulated GNRF activity and p21ras-GTP formation corresponded more closely to the time course of Shc phosphorylation than to the kinetics of IRS-1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of Shc proteins from cell lysates of insulin-stimulated cells removed 67% of the GNRF activity, whereas precipitation of IRS-1 had a negligible effect on GNRF activity. Thus, although both IRS-1 and Shc associate with Grb2, the current results indicate that Shc plays a more important role than IRS-1 in insulin stimulation of GNRF activity and subsequent p21ras-GTP formation."
https://openalex.org/W2107121913,"CD22 beta is a B cell surface glycoprotein involved in cell adhesion and activation. We previously reported that a recombinant soluble form termed CD22 beta Rg is capable of binding alpha 2-6 sialylated complex N-linked oligosaccharides purified from lymphocyte glycoprotein ligands (Powell, L. D., Sgroi, D., Sjoberg, E. R., Stamenkovic, I., and Varki, A. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 7019-7027). Here, we utilize a number of naturally and enzymatically sialylated oligosaccharides and sialoglycoproteins to further define its lectin specificity and demonstrate that the minimal structure recognized is Neu5Ac alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4Glc(NAc). Reduction of the glucose residue of Neu5-Ac alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4Glc diminishes the interaction, while truncation of the sialic acid side chain by mild periodate oxidation abolishes it. Branched oligosaccharides with two alpha 2-6-sialyl residues bind better, regardless of whether they were derived from N- or O-linked oligosaccharides or from gangliosides. alpha 2-3-Sialyl residues have no effect on binding, whereas increasing the number of alpha 2-6-sialyl residues on multiantennary oligosaccharides progressively improves binding. No specific feature of the core region affects binding, although the spacing of the alpha 2-6-sialyl residues on tetraantennary chains appears to have a significant effect. Of several model sialoglycoproteins examined, fetuin and transferrin had an apparent affinity no greater than that observed with free sialylated N-linked oligosaccharides. Some subfractions of these proteins displayed unexpectedly weak binding, suggesting that the protein backbone can exert a negative effect. In contrast, a subfraction of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein was identified as having a substantially higher apparent affinity than free oligosaccharides derived from it, indicating that multiple glycosylation sites may increase the apparent binding affinity. Thus, CD22 beta Rg contains a lectin activity specific for the minimal motif Neu5Ac alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4Glc(NAc), and branched, multisialylated oligosaccharides are better ligands, regardless of the core sequences. Intact sialoglycoproteins can also interact, although with a variable affinity not directly predictable from the precise structure of their sialylated oligosaccharides chains. These data may help to explain why certain T and B cell surface sialoglycoproteins with the Neu5Ac alpha 2-6Gal beta 1-4Glc(NAc) motif are superior ligands, capable of mediating CD22 beta-mediated adhesion and activation events."
https://openalex.org/W1511537290,"Activation of lipocytes, characterized by increased proliferation and fibrogenesis, is a central feature of the hepatic wound healing response. We have examined whether modulation of receptors for transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) contributes to the fibrogenic behavior of activated lipocytes. Isolated lipocytes were maintained in a quiescent state by culturing the cells in suspension, where they displayed minimal specific binding for TGF-beta 1 and only a small amount of type III (betaglycan) receptor by affinity labeling. In contrast, lipocytes activated by growth on uncoated plastic displayed saturable binding of TGF-beta 1 (Kd = 28 pM, 7,730 receptors/cell), and receptors types I, II, and III. Binding activity in quiescent and activated cells correlated with responsiveness to TGF-beta 1; TGF-beta 1 induced cellular fibronectin mRNA expression only in activated and not quiescent cells. Despite the absence of binding in quiescent cells, type II receptor was detectable by immunoblot. By RNase protection assay, mRNAs for receptor types II and III were greater in quiescent than activated cells. In freshly isolated lipocytes from animals with liver injury caused by the administration of carbon tetrachloride, a rapid but transient increase in mRNA for receptor types I (approximately 3.2-fold), II (approximately 1.5-fold), and III (approximately 3-fold) was observed with peaks at 12 h for type I receptor, 1 h for type II receptor, and 6 h for type III receptor; mRNA induction was followed by down-regulation for all receptors. The modest changes in mRNAs compared with marked alterations in binding activity during mesenchymal cell activation suggest that TGF-beta receptors may be regulated in vivo in part by a post-translational mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1515314521,"A 110-kDa protein involved in heparin biosynthesis in mouse mastocytoma cells was previously shown to express both glucosaminyl N-deacetylase and N-sulfotransferase activity. In this study, the complete nucleotide sequence corresponding to this protein is reported. The mRNA, estimated to contain 3.9 kilobases encodes a protein with an M(r) of 101,092. The predicted domain structure of the protein resembles those of previously characterized Golgi proteins with an N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a single membrane-spanning domain, and a large catalytic domain linked to the transmembrane domain through a stem region. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the mouse mastocytoma protein and a previously cloned similar enzyme from rat liver demonstrated that while large portions of the proteins, corresponding essentially to the putative catalytic domains, were closely related, other portions, in particular in the N-terminal parts, were markedly different. The divergence was not due to species differences since two separate mouse transcripts could be identified that hybridized with probes specific for the two proteins. Also, functional differences were noted since the mastocytoma enzyme, contrary to the liver enzyme, requires a polycation cofactor for expression of N-deacetylase activity. The results are discussed in relation to the structural properties of heparin and heparan sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1526965277,"Sialic acids decorating blood and cell surface proteins can play important roles in various biological processes. The inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1, as well as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, can activate vascular endothelium, increasing expression of several surface glycoproteins. Here we show that treatment of cultured human endothelial cells (HEC) with TNF-alpha, interleukin-1, or lipopolysaccharide causes increased expression of the enzyme beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialytransferase (alpha 2-6STN). TNF-alpha was most effective, inducing a 3.5-fold enhancement of cell-associated sialytransferase activity by 72 h. In addition, activated HEC secreted a large portion of the induced sialyltransferase activity into the medium. Analysis of labeled HEC showed both a relative and an absolute increase of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid on N-linked oligosaccharides after TNF-alpha stimulation. This coincided with increased expression of endothelial glycoproteins bearing N-linked glycans with alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid detected by the lectin Sambucus nigra agglutinin. The cytokine-inducible endothelial cell adhesion molecules E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 are among these glycoprotein substrates for alpha 2-6STN. These changes also correlated with a substantial increase in binding sites for CD22 beta, a mammalian lectin known to recognize oligosaccharides carrying multiple copies of alpha 2,6-linked sialic acid. Northern analysis revealed increased levels of mRNA encoding alpha 2-6STN. Thus, activation of endothelial cells during inflammatory and immunological processes may induce alpha 2-6STN, which can participate in sialylation of other activation-dependent molecules."
https://openalex.org/W1598285904,"Signaling by tyrosine kinases involves direct associations between proteins with Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and sites of tyrosine phosphorylation. Specificity in signaling pathways results in part from inherent selectivity in interactions between particular SH2 domains and phosphopeptide sequences. The cytoplasmic phosphotyrosine phosphatase SH-PTP2 (Syp, PTP 1D, PTP-2C) contains two SH2 domains (N and C) which mediate its association with and activation by the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and epidermal growth factor receptors and IRS-1. We have developed a competitive phosphopeptide binding assay to analyze specificity of the SH-PTP2 N-SH2 domain for phosphorylation sites of these phosphoproteins. The sequence surrounding Tyr1009 bound with greatest affinity (ID50 = 14 microM) of eight PDGF receptor-derived phosphopeptides tested. No peptides corresponding to known epidermal growth factor receptor phosphorylation sites bound with high affinity. However, an alternative sequence surrounding Tyr954 bound tightly (ID50 = 21 microM). Of the 13 IRS-1-related peptides analyzed, sequences surrounding Tyr546, Tyr895, and Tyr1172 bound with highest affinity (ID50 = 11, 4, and 1 microM, respectively). Alternative phosphopeptides generally bound with much weaker affinity (ID50 > 150 microM). These findings are consistent with recent mutational analyses of the PDGF receptor and predict site-specific interactions between SH-PTP2 and each of these phosphoproteins. Comparisons between peptide sequences suggest that the N-terminal SH2 domain of SH-PTP2 binds with highest affinity to phosphotyrosine (pY) followed by a beta-branched residue (Val, Ile, Thr) at pY+1 and a hydrophobic residue (Val, Leu, Ile) at pY+3 positions. Peptide truncation studies also indicate that residues outside of the pY-1 to pY+4 motif are required for high affinity interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1514596093,"Abstract Protein kinase C (PKC) has been implicated in the activation of phospholipase D (PLD) in a number of systems. By antisense technology, we have knocked out alpha and beta isoforms of PKC to study the role of these isoforms in PLD activation in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. To this end, we have studied PLD activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), ATP, UTP, and 2-methylthio-ATP in cells labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. [3H]Phosphatidylethanol (PEt) production catalyzed by PLD in the presence of ethanol was time- and concentration-dependent in PMA- and nucleotide-stimulated cells. In Ca(2+)-free medium, [3H]PEt accumulation was diminished for all stimuli assayed. Treatment of cells with chelerythrine, an inhibitor of PKC, and phorbol ester down-regulation of PKC inhibited [3H]PEt production by both PMA and nucleotides. In cells transfected with antisense PKC alpha or both PKC alpha and PKC beta, PLD activation was inhibited by both PMA and nucleotides, whereas in cells transfected with antisense PKC beta, PLD activation was similar to that of control cells. Moreover, inhibition of polyphosphoinositide-specific PLC (by neomycin) or of release of arachidonic acid and arachidonic acid metabolites (by nordihydroguaiaretic acid or by indomethacin) failed to decrease [3H]PEt accumulation in PMA- and nucleotide-stimulated MDCK-D1 cells. From these data, we conclude that in MDCK-D1 cells PMA and nucleotide receptors utilize PKC alpha to regulate PLD activity and that PLD activation is independent of the activation of polyphosphoinositide-specific PLC and phospholipase A2-mediated release of arachidonic acid or arachidonic acid metabolites."
https://openalex.org/W1647577587,"Selenophosphate synthetase, the product of the selD gene, produces the biologically active selenium donor compound, monoselenophosphate, from ATP and selenide. Isolation of the enzyme and characterization of some of its physical and catalytic properties are described. Magnesium ion and a monovalent cation, K+, NH4+, or Rb+, are required for catalytic activity. Polyphosphates and other common nucleotide triphosphates do not replace ATP as substrate. The stoichiometry of the catalytic reaction (Reaction 1) was established using 31P NMR, anaerobic molecular sieve chromatography, and radiochemical labeling procedures. ATP+selenide+H2O-->selenophosphate+Pi+AMP. In the absence of selenide, ATP is converted completely to AMP and orthophosphate upon prolonged incubation with elevated levels of enzyme. AMP is a competitive inhibitor of ATP, Ki = 170 microM, whereas selenophosphate and orthophosphate are weak inhibitors indicating a multistep reaction. Attempts to obtain direct evidence for a postulated enzyme-pyrophosphate intermediate using several experimental approaches are described. No exchange of [14C]AMP with ATP could be detected after the enzyme was freed of traces of contaminating adenylate kinase by chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose."
https://openalex.org/W1582010642,"The actin-binding protein calponin has been implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. We have isolated cDNA clones encoding a novel acidic calponin isoform from rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. The initial 273 residues of the deduced 330 amino acid polypeptide (M(r) 36,377) are highly homologous to basic smooth muscle calponin isoforms, but the remaining 57 residues at the carboxyl terminus comprise a unique and strongly acidic domain. The sequence of the acidic domain shows high homology (93.3% identity) to the partial sequence of HUMXT01244, an unidentified human hippocampal gene product (Adams, M., Dubnick, M., Kerlavgne, A. R., Moreno, R., Kelly, J. M., Utterback, T. R., Nagle, J. W., Fields, C., and Venter, J. C. (1992) Nature 355, 632-634). Transcripts encoding acidic calponin are expressed in cultured rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells and in non-muscle and smooth muscle tissues of adult rat. Based on its calculated M(r) and the tissue distribution of its expression, acidic calponin is an excellent candidate for a previously detected non-muscle calponin homolog (Takeuchi, K., Takahashi, K., Abe, M., Nishida, W., Hiwada, K., Nabeya, T., and Maruyama, K. (1991) J. Biochem. (Tokyo) 109, 311-316). Like basic calponin isoforms, acidic calponin synthesized in a bacterial expression system bound F-actin. However, unlike basic calponin, the acidic isoform did not interact with Ca2+/calmodulin, indicating a functional distinction between the muscle and non-muscle forms."
https://openalex.org/W1490431590,"Abstract CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) is an important regulatory enzyme in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. The enzyme exists as a soluble, inactive form that is highly phosphorylated; activation of the enzyme is accompanied by dephosphorylation and translocation to the membrane. We have used a recombinant baculovirus clone to obtain CT labeled in vivo with 32PO4. The tryptic phosphopeptide pattern of the baculovirus-expressed CT was the same as for CT expressed in mammalian cells, indicating that insect cells modify the same phosphorylation sites as do mammalian cells. 32PO4-labeled, baculovirus-expressed CT was digested with trypsin and the peptides purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Phosphoamino acid analysis of the complete protein as well as individual peptides revealed that only serine residues were phosphorylated. Sequence analysis of purified radioactive peptides revealed that phosphorylation of CT was confined to the carboxyl-terminal region and that all or nearly all Ser residues from Ser315 to the carboxyl terminus were labeled. Ser315, Ser319, Ser329, Ser323, Ser331, Ser343, and Ser347 all reside in potential sites for proline-directed kinases. Two other phosphorylated serine residues, Ser315 and Ser333, are found within protein kinase C consensus phosphorylation sites. Ser321, Ser322, Ser333, Ser345, Ser346, Ser350, Ser352, and Ser362 were also found to be phosphorylated. Serine362 resides within a putative casein kinase II phosphorylation site, and there are five potential sites for phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3. Identification of these sites will allow investigations that focus on the establishment of the physiological function of phosphorylation at each site."
https://openalex.org/W1618929865,"This report extends our observation that cellular retinoic acid-binding protein type I (CRABP) serves as substrate for retinoic acid metabolism by testis microsomes. Retinoic acid bound to excess CRABP was metabolized at 70% of the unbound retinoic acid rate with testis microsomes and at the same rates as unbound retinoic acid with kidney and lung microsomes. Chromatography of testis, lung, kidney, and liver microsomal incubations provided two sets of metabolites each, P1 and P2. The composition of P2 was characteristic of the individual tissue. CRABP had modest quantitative affects on P2 composition, but did not affect P2 qualitatively. Retinoids bound to CRABP, isolated from a testis microsomal incubation, consisted of 50% retinoic acid, 32% P1 and 17% P2, suggesting that CRABP may bind retinoic acid metabolites in vivo. The effect of CRABP on the rate of metabolism was retinoid specific. Two major components of P2, 4-hydroxy-retinoic acid and 4-oxo-retinoic acid, when bound to CRABP were metabolized slowly, if at all, by testis microsomes, in contrast to CRABP-bound retinoic acid which had an elimination t1/2 of 40 min. Unbound retinoic acid, 4-hydroxy-retinoic acid, and 4-oxo-retinoic acid had elimination t1/2 values of 35, 40, and 9 min, respectively. Reduced metabolism of CRABP-bound C4-derivatized retinoids suggests pathways of retinoic acid metabolism besides the one initiated by C4-hydroxylation. This was corroborated by identification of 18-hydroxy-retinoic acid as a testis, lung, and liver microsomal retinoic acid metabolite. Ketoconazole inhibited the metabolism by testis microsomes of free and CRABP-bound retinoic acid with IC50 values of 2 and 0.7 microM, respectively, denoting catalysis by cytochrome P-450. These results indicate that cloistering retinoic acid in CRABP, while permitting metabolism, may operate throughout CRABP-expressing tissues as a mechanism of controlling the concentrations of free retinoic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1489866685,"The 47-kDa subunit of the NADPH oxidase system (p47-phox) of neutrophils undergoes an association with proteins in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction upon stimulation of the cells with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This fraction contains the assembled oxidase that catalyzes the generation of superoxide by stimulated cells. In this paper, we report that the addition of an inhibitor of protein kinases (1-(5-isoquinolinylsulfonyl-2-methylpiperazine) to neutrophils that are already stimulated results in the dissociation of p47-phox from this fraction. Antagonists of type 1 and 2A protein phosphatases (calyculin A, okadaic acid) prevented this phenomenon. In contrast, norokadanone, an inactive analog of okadaic acid, did not affect this response. These observations are correlated with previous studies on the phosphorylation of p47-phox and superoxide release. In addition, we show that protein kinase C (PKC) also undergoes an extensive redistribution to the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction in 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-stimulated cells, the extent of which is diminished significantly in neutrophils from chronic granulomatous disease patients who lack either p47-phox or cytochrome b558. These studies strongly indicate that PKC and type 1 and/or 2A protein phosphatases are involved in a continuous phosphorylation reaction that maintains the oxidase in the assembled/active state. Moreover, components of the oxidase may target and facilitate the translocation of PKC to a cellular site in close apposition to the oxidase."
https://openalex.org/W1538342062,"We report the purification and proteolytic characterization of the 49-kDa form of exoenzyme S and the cloning of the structural gene for the 49-kDa form of exoenzyme S (exoS). The 49-kDa form of exoenzyme S was purified from SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Conditions were established that allowed efficient trypsin digestion of the 49-kDa form of exoenzyme S. Amino acid sequence determination of the amino terminus and tryptic peptides of the 49-kDa form of exoenzyme S allowed the generation of degenerate oligonucleotides, which were used to amplify DNA encoding an amino-terminal sequence and an internal sequence of the 49-kDa form of exoenzyme S. These DNA fragments were used to clone the entire structural gene for the 49-kDa form of exoenzyme S (exoS) from a cosmid library of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 388. The 49-kDa form of exoenzyme S (ExoS) is predicted to be a 453 amino acid protein. The predicted amino acid sequence indicates that ExoS is secreted from Pseudomonas without cleavage of an amino-terminal sequence. BESTFIT analysis identified three regions of alignment between ExoS and the active site of Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin. One region of homology appears to be shared among several members of the family of bacterial ADP-ribosyltransferases."

The as-isolated protein displays a pink color (pink form) and contains two mononuclear iron sites in different oxidation states: a ferric site (center I) with a distorted tetrahedral sulfur coordination similar to that found in desulforedoxin from Desulfovibrio gigas and a ferrous site (center II) octahedrally coordinated with predominantly nitrogen/oxygen-containing ligands. A new form of desulfoferrodoxin which displays a gray color (gray form) has now been purified. Optical, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and Mossbauer data of the gray desulfoferrodoxin indicate that both iron centers are in the high-spin ferric states. In addition to the EPR signals originating from center I at g = 7.7, 5.7, 4.1, and 1.8, the gray form of desulfoferrodoxin exhibits a signal at g = 4.3 and a shoulder at g = 9.6, indicating a high-spin ferric state with E/D approximately 1/3 for the oxidized center II. Redox titrations of the gray form of the protein monitored by optical spectroscopy indicate midpoint potentials of +4 +/- 10 and +240 +/- 10 mV for centers I and II, respectively. Mossbauer spectra of the gray form of the protein are consistent with the EPR finding that both centers are high-spin ferric and can be analyzed in terms of the EPR-determined spin Hamiltonian parameters. The Mossbauer parameters for both the ferric and ferrous forms of center II are indicative of a mononuclear high spin iron site with octahedral coordination and predominantly nitrogen/oxygen-containing ligands. Resonance Raman studies confirm the structural similarity of center I and the distorted tetrahedral FeS4 center in desulforedoxin and provide evidence for one or two cysteinyl-S ligands for center II. On the basis of the resonance Raman results, the 635 nm absorption band that is responsible for the gray color of the oxidized protein is assigned to a cysteinyl-S-->Fe(III) charge transfer transition localized on center II. The novel properties and possible function of center II are discussed in relation to those of mononuclear iron centers in other enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1560596098,"Previous studies suggest that Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) inserts into mammalian membranes. Using Triton X-114 phase separation analysis and charge-shift electrophoresis, this study demonstrates that CPE exhibits the amphiphilicity required for membrane insertion, but this behavior develops only after exposure of CPE to membranes. This effect does not require proteolytic or covalent CPE modifications or formation of a previously reported 160-kDa CPE-containing complex. A novel 90-kDa CPE-containing complex with amphiphilic properties was detected in intestinal brush-border membranes and in CPE-sensitive, but not CPE-insensitive, cell lines using nondenaturing Triton X-100 electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitation analysis suggested that the 90-kDa complex is composed of CPE and a 45-50-kDa membrane protein. Since the 90-kDa complex is formed only in cells that bind and respond to CPE, these results are consistent with the 45-50-kDa protein mediating CPE amphiphilicity and serving as a functional CPE receptor. A four-step model for CPE action is proposed. 1) CPE binds to the 45-50-kDa protein to form a 90-kDa complex. 2) The 90-kDa complex undergoes some physical change corresponding to insertion or a conformational change. 3) The 90-kDa complex and a 70-kDa membrane protein interact to form a 160-kDa complex. 4) Formation of the 160-kDa complex leads to permeability alterations."

Since bile acids are efficiently absorbed by an active, Na(+)-dependent transport system in the ileum of mammals, model peptides of different chain length were attached to the 3-position of modified 3 beta-(omega-amino-alkoxy)-7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta-cholan-24-oic acid. These peptide-bile acid conjugates inhibited Na(+)-dependent [3H]taurocholate uptake into brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from rabbit ileum in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, photoaffinity labeling of the bile acid-binding proteins of M(r) 93,000 and 14,000, identified as the protein components of the ileal Na(+)-dependent bile acid transport system in rabbit ileum (Kramer, W., Girbig, F., Gutjahr, U., Kowalewski, S., Jouvenal, K., Muller, G., Tripier, D., and Wess, G. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 18035-18046) by the photoreactive taurocholate analogue, (3,3-azo-7 alpha, 12 alpha-dihydroxy-5 beta [7 beta, -12 beta-3H]cholan-24-oyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, was inhibited by the peptide-bile acid conjugates. In contrast, the parent peptides and amino acids neither had a significant effect on [3H]taurocholate uptake by ileal brush-border membrane vesicles nor on photoaffinity labeling of the ileal bile acid-binding membrane proteins. The inhibitory effect of peptide-bile acid conjugates on [3H]taurocholate transport and photoaffinity labeling of the bile acid-binding proteins in rabbit ileal vesicles decreased with increasing chain length of the attached peptide radical. By in vivo ileum perfusion in anesthetized rats an intestinal absorption of the bile acid conjugate S3744 of the fluorescent oxaprolylpeptide 4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-beta-Ala-Phe-5-Opr-Gly (S1037) and secretion of the intact compound into bile could be demonstrated, whereas the parent peptide S1037 or its t-butylester S4404 were not absorbed. The intestinal absorption of S3744 showed a similar temperature dependence as [3H]taurocholate absorption and was inhibited by the presence of taurocholate indicating a carrier-mediated uptake of S3744 via the ileal bile acid transporter. In conclusion, these results indicate that oligopeptides can be made enterally absorable by coupling to modified bile acid molecules making use of the specific intestinal absorption pathway for bile acids. This finding may be of great importance for the design and development of orally active peptide drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1506923475,"There is contradictory information regarding the molecular weight and polypeptide chain composition of RVV-X, a glycoprotein in Russell's viper venom that is capable of activating factor X to Xa. We show that RVV-X is a 92,880-Da glycoprotein. It consists of three disulfide-linked polypeptide chains, one heavy chain (alpha-chain, M(r) 57,600) and two light chains (beta- and gamma-chains, M(r) 19,400 and 16,400, respectively). The two light chains seen on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions are two distinct components of the molecule, rather than a heterogeneous mixture of a single chain as previously reported (Takeya, H., Nishida, S., Miyata, T., Kawada, S., Saisaka, Y., Morita, T., and Iwanaga, S. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 14109-14117). The following evidence supports this conclusion. (i) The two light chains of RVV-X are present in equal proportion. (ii) The estimated molecular weight of an alpha 1 beta 1 gamma 1-structure closely matches the molecular weight determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry. (iii) The amino acid compositions and NH2-terminal sequences of the beta- and gamma-chains are different. (iv) Although both the beta- and gamma-chains contain one N-linked oligosaccharide chain each, they are glycosylated differentially. RVV-X contains six N-linked oligosaccharides, four in the alpha-chain and one in each of the beta- and gamma-chains. The carbohydrate structures are different from those known for other snake venom glycoproteins, and they resemble closely those in various mammalian glycoproteins. The majority of the oligosaccharides are complex bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary structures, with a small proportion of multiantennary and high mannose-type structures. Two notable structural features of RVV-X oligosaccharides are as follows. (i) Sialic acid residues are linked to beta-galactosyl residues solely by alpha 2,3-linkages, and (ii) bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residues are present in the majority of the oligosaccharides."
https://openalex.org/W1564278272,"Antimicrobial peptides comprise a diverse class of molecules used in host defense by plants, insects, and animals. In this study we have isolated a novel antimicrobial peptide from the skin of the bullfrog, Rana catesbeiana. This 20 amino acid peptide, which we have termed Ranalexin, has the amino acid sequence: NH2-Phe-Leu-Gly-Gly-Leu-Ile-Lys-Ile-Val-Pro-Ala-Met-Ile-Cys-Ala-Val-Thr- Lys-Lys - Cys-COOH, and it contains a single intramolecular disulfide bond which forms a heptapeptide ring within the molecule. Structurally, Ranalexin resembles the bacterial antibiotic, polymyxin, which contains a similar heptapeptide ring. We have also cloned the cDNA for Ranalexin from a metamorphic R. catesbeiana tadpole cDNA library. Based on the cDNA sequence, it appears that Ranalexin is initially synthesized as a propeptide with a putative signal sequence and an acidic amino acid-rich region at its amino-terminal end. Interestingly, the putative signal sequence of the Ranalexin cDNA is strikingly similar to the signal sequence of opioid peptide precursors isolated from the skin of the South American frogs Phyllomedusa sauvagei and Phyllomedusa bicolor. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization experiments demonstrated that Ranalexin mRNA is first expressed in R. catesbeiana skin at metamorphosis and continues to be expressed into adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W139067782,"Membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), a widely distributed regulatory protein, inhibits complement activation on host cells and serves as a measles virus receptor. Most cells express four isoforms (with one of two cytoplasmic tails, CYT-1 or CYT-2). Previously, we noted that MCP precursors had variable intracellular processing. Therefore, we characterized the intracellular transport of individual MCP isoforms. Transfectants were used for pulse-chase analyses. MCP isoforms bearing CYT-1 chased into their mature, surface forms with a half-life (t1/2) of 10-13 min while those with CYT-2 required 35-40 min. The precursor of a tail-less mutant possessed a t1/2 of 160-165 min. Chimeras were constructed that added both tails in opposite orientation onto the isoform (i.e. CYT 1 + 2 or CYT 2 + 1). Chimera 1 + 2 precursor processed with a t1/2 of 35-37 min, similar to CYT-2. Chimera 2 + 1 had a t1/2 of 15-19 min, more closely resembling CYT-1. Thus, in both cases the carboxyl-terminal tail controlled the processing rate. Deletions were made in the beginning, middle, and carboxyl terminus of CYT-1. Deletion of the first or middle six amino acids had no effect on the processing rate. However, deletion of the terminal tetrapeptide (FTSL) slowed the rate to 30-32 min, suggesting that this sequence facilitates exit from the endoplasmic reticulum."
https://openalex.org/W1516183296,"Abstract The contractile protein troponin I is encoded by a multigene family whose members are expressed differentially in various classes of muscle fibers. In vertebrates, the isoform of troponin I is expressed during early heart and skeletal muscle development but is restricted to slow twitch skeletal muscle in the adult. This diverse expression pattern offers an opportunity to study the regulation of a single gene within different developmental contexts. To initiate such studies, we have cloned the gene encoding the human slow twitch skeletal muscle isoform of troponin I and have identified 5'-flanking sequences required for its expression in skeletal muscle cells. The slow troponin I gene spans 12.5 kilobases and is divided into nine exons. In contrast to many muscle-specific genes, the troponin I promoter does not contain consensus CCAAT or TATA elements. Moreover, the sequence from -9 to +11 resembles an initiator element previously shown to direct transcription of some tissue-specific genes lacking TATA boxes (Smale, S. T., and Baltimore, D. (1989) Cell 57, 103-113; Brand, N. J., Petkovich, M., and Chambon, P. (1990) Nucleic Acids Res. 18, 6799-6806; Weis, L., and Reinberg, D. (1992) FASEB J. 6, 3300-3309). A transcriptional fusion construct, comprising 4.2 kilobases of troponin I 5'-flanking DNA linked to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase gene, exhibited cell type-specific and developmentally regulated expression. A muscle-specific enhancer regulated slow troponin I promoter activity."
https://openalex.org/W1530242502,"The sequences of the human and bovine genes for the phosphate carrier from the inner membranes of mitochondria have been determined. The genes have similar structures and each is divided into nine exons. In both genes, two exons, named IIIA and IIIB, are closely related, and they appear to the alternatively spliced. The human exon IIIB sequence is found in a published human heart cDNA sequence, and bovine exon IIIA forms part of a published bovine heart cDNA sequence. By further examination of the human heart cDNA library, sequences arising from both alternatively spliced forms of the phosphate carrier have been characterized. Both forms were also found in several bovine tissues, but the ratios of expression of the two forms varied. The form containing exon IIIA was expressed most highly in bovine heart and liver, less highly in brain and kidney, and only in low amounts in lung. The opposite hierarchy was found for the form containing exon IIIB; it was most highly expressed in lung and least in heart and liver. The alternative splicing mechanism affects amino acids 4-45 of the mature phosphate carrier protein, which is believed to form one of six transmembrane segments of the phosphate carrier and to emerge into a large extramembranous loop. The alternative splicing mechanism changes 13 and 11 amino acids in the human and bovine carrier proteins, respectively. As the function of this region of the phosphate carrier is not known, the effects of the changes on carrier function are not understood at present."
https://openalex.org/W1553075222,"Adipocyte and heart fatty acid binding proteins (A-FABP and H-FABP) are closely related members of the FABP family. Unlike the more distantly related liver FABP, these FABP have been proposed to transfer free fatty acids to model membranes by a collisional mechanism (Wootan, M. G., Bernlohr, D. A., and Storch, J. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 8622-8627; Kim, H. K., and Storch, J. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 20051-20056). Collisional transfer requires that the acceptor membranes interact with FABP during the transfer process. We, therefore, examined whether the acceptor membrane structure and lipid composition regulate the rate of anthroyloxy-labeled palmitate (2AP) transfer from A- and H-FABP, using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay. The results showed that 2AP transfer from A- and H-FABP was more rapid to acceptor vesicles containing acidic phospholipids and was slower to positively charged membranes. In addition, the rate of 2AP transfer from A- and H-FABP was enhanced by unsaturation of the phosphatidylcholine acyl chains and was slowed by the presence of cholesterol or sphingomyelin in the acceptor membranes. These latter changes were small but of a similar magnitude and together suggest that fatty acid transfer from A- and H-FABP was slower to membranes of greater lipid order. Since transfer by an aqueous diffusion mechanism would be unaffected by acceptor membrane properties, these studies strengthen the hypothesis that free fatty acid transfer from A- and H-FABP to membranes occurs via a collisional mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1512596821,"Regulatory volume increase (RVI) has been studied in cultured human fibroblasts (CHF) incubated in a complete hypertonic growth medium (400 mosmol/kg). After the initial cell shrinkage induced by hypertonic treatment, cells recover their volume almost completely within 3 h. This RVI response is associated with a marked increase of the cell content of free amino acids. The cell content of potassium increases only slightly. Chromatographic analysis of the intracellular amino acid pool shows that the RVI-associated increase in cell amino acids is mainly a result of changes in the L-glutamine content. The intracellular accumulation of the analog 2-methylaminoisobutyric acid, a specific substrate of transport system A, is increased in CHF undergoing RVI. Hypertonic treatment causes an immediate and sustained cell hyperpolarization, as demonstrated by changes in the trans-membrane distribution ratio of L-arginine and in the fluorescence of the potential-sensitive dye bis-1,3-diethylthiobarbiturate-trimethineoxonol. Because of cell hyperpolarization, at the end of RVI the trans-membrane gradient of the sodium electrochemical potential is higher than that of the control. The increase in the extracellular potassium concentration ([K+]out = 40 mM) abolishes the hyperpolarization induced by hypertonic treatment and delays volume recovery. Cycloheximide suppresses RVI at a high but not at physiologic [K+]out. It is proposed that CHF counteract hypertonic shrinkage through an enhanced accumulation of substrates of transport system A sustained, initially, by an increase in the energy available for transport and, subsequently, also by the synthesis of new site A carriers."
https://openalex.org/W1528578501,"Abstract Digestion of renal Na/K-ATPase with trypsin, in the presence of rubidium and absence of calcium ions, produces so-called containing a C-terminal 19-kDa and smaller fragments (8-12 kDa) of the alpha chain, and a beta chain either intact or split into two fragments (Karlish, S. J. D., Goldshleger, R., and Stein, W.D. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 4566-4570). Cation occlusion is intact. The cation sites are thought to be located within trans-membrane segments, but the identity and number of segments involved is unknown. Analysis of Ca(2+)-induced sensitization of 19-kDa membranes to proteolysis, and characterization of the limit membrane-embedded fragments, has provided some insight into this question. Calcium ions have been shown to compete with two rubidium ions for occlusion sites on 19-kDa membranes, with a high affinity (KD approximately 2.8 microM, pH 7.5, 20 degrees C). The kinetics of displacement of rubidium by calcium ions indicate that competition is direct and is not an allosteric antagonism. At 37 degrees C, reversible displacement of rubidium ions by calcium ions is followed by an irreversible thermal inactivation of rubidium occlusion. Calcium ions partially protect rubidium occlusion sites against modification by the carboxyl reagent, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. We propose that calcium ions, like rubidium ions, recognize carboxyl groups at the entrance to the cation sites, but the calcium ions do not become occluded and thus fail to protect 19-kDa membranes against further proteolysis or thermal inactivation. Upon displacement of occluded rubidium, trypsin digests the Ca(2+)-bound and thermally inactivated 19-kDa membranes, and all of the membrane-embedded fragments are truncated or are split in these conditions. A related finding is that the C-terminal sequence of the 19-kDa fragment (and alpha chain), E-T-Y-Y, is digested by carboxypeptidase Y only when the rubidium occlusion is inactivated. Identification of the limit tryptic fragments indicates that polypeptide loops and the C-terminal tail of the 19-kDa fragment, N and C termini of the smaller fragments of the alpha chain, and both N and C termini of a 16-kDa fragment of the beta chain are split by proteolytic enzymes upon displacement of occluded rubidium.4+ We conclude that all fragments of 19-kDa membranes form a complex, which is stabilized and protected against proteolytic enzymes upon occlusion of rubidium ions, and which relaxes upon displacement of occluded rubidium. The cation occlusion cage presumably consists of litigating groups from several trans-membrane segments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1523594094,"Among all the receptor-linked protein-tyrosine-phosphatase RPTP alpha clones described from mammalian tissues, one differed in that it encoded a 9-amino-acid insert 3 residues upstream from the transmembrane segment (Kaplan, R., Morse, B., Huebner, K., Croce, C., Howk, R. Ravera, M., Ricca, G., Jaye, M., and Schlessinger, J. (1990) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 87, 7000-7004). Using the polymerase chain reaction technique, simultaneous expression of both isoforms was demonstrated in human T-cell and vascular smooth muscle libraries, as well as in the A431 human epidermal cancer cell line. Following transient expression in COS-1 cells, each isoform gave rise to two proteins of 100 and 130 kDa, respectively. Endoglycosidase treatment showed that the 100-kDa species corresponded to a molecule exclusively glycosylated on N-residues, whereas the 130-kDa species contained both, N- and O-linked carbohydrates. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the smaller RPTP alpha protein is a precursor of the larger one. A high affinity antibody was generated that recognizes the immature protein only; however, both proteins can be detected by Western blot analysis after a simple chemical hydrolysis. Following Superose 12 chromatography, the 100- and 130-kDa species of RPTP alpha emerged as 200- and 340-kDa proteins, respectively. Both species exhibited similar enzymatic activities as determined with a peptide substrate in immunoprecipitates."

Mobility shift assays have revealed that Chironomus cHMG1a and cHMG1b bind double strand and four-way junction DNA in a similar way at apparent dissociation constants in the range of 7.5-20 x 10(-9) M. Both proteins are monomeric and highly asymmetric molecules in solution. cHMG1a and cHMG1b exhibit Stokes' radii of 2.4 and 2.3 nm, respectively, and both show a frictional ratio of 1.5. Despite these similarities in their hydrodynamic properties, the binding site of cHMG1a on DNA is approximately 1.5 of the size found for the cHMG1b. Enzymatically and chemically prepared peptides of cHMG1a as well as bacterially expressed cHMG1a with terminal deletions and point substitutions showed that sequences flanking the folded domain that constitutes the HMG box are essential for the interaction of the HMG box with DNA. In particular, changes in the number of positive and negative charges, respectively, within basic and acidic domains modulated the DNA binding affinity of the cHMG1a protein. The alteration of fluorescence of the Trp residues suggest that this modulation is due to interaction of the acidic domain with the positively charged HMG box."
https://openalex.org/W1562463483,"To characterize a DNA-binding protein, BCFI, which regulates the expression of silkmoth chorion genes through binding to gene promoter elements identical to those recognized by the GATA family of transcription factors, we have carried out polymerase chain reaction amplifications of Bombyx mori genomic DNA using degenerate primers derived from the conserved DNA binding domain of mammalian GATA factors. Two single copy genes, BmGATA alpha and BmGATA beta, were identified, which encode sequences containing GATA-type zinc finger motifs. The BmGATA beta gene is expressed in follicular and Bm5 tissue culture cells, the two cell types that contain BCFI. No BmGATA alpha gene transcripts were detectable in the tissues that were tested. Upon overexpression in Escherichia coli, a peptide encompassing the BmGATA beta zinc finger motif was able to bind specifically to the BCFI recognition motif of the chorion gene promoters. A polyclonal antibody directed against the zinc finger domain of BmGATA beta was also used in gel retardation assays to confirm that factor BCFI is indeed encoded by the BmGATA beta gene. Conceptual translation of a complete cDNA clone encoding the BmGATA beta protein revealed that this protein has a size similar to that of an immunoreactive protein, presumably BCFI, which is present in follicular cell extracts."

Of the synthetic peptides employed, alpha 118-137 displayed the highest affinity of FK1 binding. Binding of FK1 and WF6 to single residue-substituted analogs of the sequence alpha 181-200 indicated that the two antibodies have different attachment point patterns within this sequence region. These results, and those of ligand competition studies, suggest that the binding sites for FK1 and physostigmine, and those of WF6 and acetylcholine, are within the same general region of the receptor's three-dimensional structure.

We have performed the cloning, expression, and characterization of the altered DHFR-TS gene. The DNA sequence of the altered DHFR-TS gene revealed a single base change in position 158 which resulted in the substitution of a methionine in position 53 of DHFR for an arginine. Steady-state measurements of the purified recombinant enzyme indicated that the mutation did not cause significant modifications in the Km for DHFR or TS substrates but lowered the kcat by 4-fold. Of greater interest, there was a modification in the effect on MTX inhibition of DHFR. The initial inhibition complex appeared to have been unaffected by the alteration, but the subsequent slow-binding step of inhibition in the wild-type enzyme is absent in the altered enzyme. Consequently, the overall Ki for MTX was 30-fold greater for the mutant than for the wild-type enzyme. Transfection of L. major with the mutant DHFR-TS gene gives parasites that are capable of growing in medium containing 10 mM methotrexate, showing that the altered DHFR gene is in itself capable of conferring MTX resistance in Leishmania."
https://openalex.org/W1566657829,"PC12 cells possess a bumetanide-sensitive Na/K/2Cl cotransport system similar to that found in other cell types. Between 10-15% of the total 86Rb influx in these cells is mediated by this pathway under normal conditions. The cotransporter has affinities of 16.5 mM for Nao and 0.7 mM for Ko, is absolutely dependent on Clo and is loop diuretic inhibitable (benzmetanide > bumetanide > piretanide > furosemide). The cotransporter can be activated (up to 8-fold) by cell shrinkage or (up to 4-fold) by treatment with the protein phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid (EC50 approximately 650 nM) or calyculin A (EC50 approximately 8 nM). Cell shrinkage is followed by a bumetanide-sensitive regulatory volume increase as determined in cell sizing experiments. Calyculin A rapidly elevates normal cell volume in a diuretic-inhibitable manner. Cotransport activity and cell volume are also increased by nerve growth factor (NGF) treatment. The effect of NGF on cotransport rate is biphasic, with an initial rapid approximately 2.5-fold increase followed by a prolonged plateau, and is blocked by pretreatment of the cells with K252a (IC50 approximately 30 nM). By contrast, agents that raise cAMP or phorbol esters lead to an inhibition of cotransport, indicating that the NGF effect is not mediated by stimulation of either cAMP-dependent protein kinase or protein kinase C. Long term NGF treatment (> 2 days) leads to neurite formation and a maintained approximately 2-fold increase in cotransport activity. Bumetanide treatment does not affect the ability of cells to extend neurites, nor is the growth rate of cells in normal medium affected by the diuretic. These results suggest that the cotransport system in PC12 cells is acutely regulated by protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation as well as cell shrinkage and that cotransport activity may be up-regulated during neuronotypic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1566241360,"Human insulin-like growth factor-1 (hIGF-1) contains seven positively charged residues in the A-, C-, and D-regions that are not present in similar positions in insulin. To determine whether these residues contribute to receptor binding specificity for the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) relative to the insulin receptor (IR) we examined the binding of hIGF-1 analogs in which these residues have been replaced with either alanine or the corresponding residue of insulin. To improve expression and facilitate purification we employed insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) analogs modified with an N-terminal 8-amino acid epitope. This additional epitope did not alter receptor binding specificity. Alanine substitution for the positively charged residues in the C- and D-regions of IGF-1 led to 15- and 10-fold losses, respectively, in binding potency for the human IGF-1R, but they increased the potency of binding to the human IR 29- and 6-fold, respectively. In contrast, substitution of the positively charged side chains in the A-region with the corresponding uncharged residues of insulin had little effect on binding to either receptor. These data suggest that the positive charges in the C- and D-regions of IGF-1 contribute significantly to the binding preference of the IGF-1R for IGF-1. In complementary experiments using chimeric receptors we have also shown that the IGF-1 receptor elements required to discriminate in favor of the positive charges in the C- and D-regions are contained in the N-terminal 283 amino acids of the alpha-subunit. Insulin receptor elements that discriminate against these charges are within the N-terminal 225 amino acids of its alpha-subunit."

Although it is known that these cytokines trigger rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of a common set of cellular proteins as well as induction of several of the same early response genes, the mechanisms by which these genes are activated is not well understood. In this report, we show that interleukin-6, leukemia inhibitory factor, and oncostatin M stimulate the assembly of protein complexes that recognize conserved sequences within the enhancers of two genes (interferon regulatory factor 1 and Fc gamma receptor type I) that are rapidly activated by these cytokines. These enhancers are known to be required for transcriptional induction of these genes by interferon-gamma. Assembly of the DNA-binding protein complexes occurs within minutes after ligand addition and depends upon tyrosine phosphorylation. These complexes contain the p91 transcription factor, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to these cytokines. An additional tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 93 kDa can be coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies against p91. These findings further expand the network of cytokines known to activate p91 and, in addition, support the concept that sets of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins may be responsible for the cytokine-regulated expression of early response genes."

Expression of the Y/F2 mutant receptor enhanced the responsiveness of MAP kinase to insulin. Moreover, the insulin responsiveness of the activator of this enzyme, MAP kinase kinase, was also increased in these cells. To explore the early signaling events that might account for this increase in responsiveness, we evaluated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate, IRS-1, and its subsequent association with phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3 kinase. In both cell types, insulin led to a dose-dependent increase in the association of tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1 with the SH2 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI-3 kinase, and also increased the amount of PI kinase activity detected in anti-IRS-1 immunoprecipitates. The effect of insulin was significantly greater in Y/F2 cells, as determined in both assays. In previous studies, cells bearing this receptor mutant exhibited an identical metabolic response but enhanced mitogenic response to insulin when compared with wild-type receptor. These data provide further evidence for divergence of the mitogenic and metabolic signaling pathways at or near the insulin receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1550801467,"There are large increases in the rates of Glc3-Man9GlcNAc2-P-P-Dol (Oligo-P-P-Dol) biosynthesis and protein N-glycosylation during the proliferative response of murine B lymphocytes (B cells) to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). To learn more about the regulation of dolichyl-saccharide biosynthesis, the possible relationships between developmental changes in specific steps in dolichyl phosphate (Dol-P) and N-acetyl-glucosaminylpyrophosphoryldolichol (GlcNAc-P-P-Dol) biosynthesis and the induction of Oligo-P-P-Dol biosynthesis were investigated. These studies describe an impressive induction of long chain cis-isoprenyltransferase (cis-IPTase) activity, an enzyme system required for the chain elongation stage in de novo Dol-P synthesis, which corresponded to the striking increase in the rate of Oligo-P-P-Dol biosynthesis in LPS-activated B cells. The cellular level and specific activity of cis-IPTase increase 15-fold in LPS-treated cells with relatively unaltered affinity for isopentenyl pyrophosphate. The rates of Dol-P and Oligo-P-P-Dol synthesis increased substantially when cis-IPTase activity was induced, suggesting a regulatory relationship between the level of cis-IPTase activity and lipid intermediate synthesis. Distinctly different developmental patterns were observed for cis-IPTase and HMG-CoA reductase activity, and when sterol biosynthesis was drastically inhibited by lovastatin, the rate of synthesis of Dol-P was slightly higher in the presence of the drug. Modest elevations in the cellular levels of dolichol kinase, Dol-P phosphatase, and UDP-GlcNAc:Dol-P N-acetylglucosaminylphosphoryltransferase (L-G1PT) activities were also observed, but these changes were relatively small compared with the increases in cis-IPTase activity and the rates of Dol-P, Gl-cNAc-P-P-Dol, and Oligo-P-P-Dol synthesis. The expression of the L-G1PT gene is an early event in the developmental program for Oligo-P-P-Dol synthesis, but GlcNAc-P-P-Dol formation is apparently not rate-limiting. In summary, large increases in cis-IPTase activity and the rate of Dol-P biosynthesis appear to play a key regulatory role in the induction of Oligo-P-P-Dol biosynthesis during the proliferative response of B cells to LPS, and the biosynthetic pathways for Dol-P and cholesterol are regulated independently in dividing B cells."
https://openalex.org/W1533851871,"Abstract This paper describes the identification in S-s-U-erythrocytes of a novel glycophorin (GP), He(P2), with structural variations in both its extracellular and transmembrane domains. In the exon II-intron 2 region, a sequence transfer from GPA to GPB, probably via the mechanism of gene conversion, was associated with the induction of multiple untemplated nucleotide replacements. These changes defined the sequence for the He epitope while concomitantly abolishing GPB-associated N antigenicity. Moreover, the GPHe(P2) gene carries two splice site mutations that coordinately affect the processing of exon V coding for the transmembrane segment. The C-->G transversion at the 3' end of exon V created a cryptic acceptor splice site, whereas the G-->T transversion at the +5 position of intron 5 altered the consensus of the donor splice site. Transcript sequencing revealed that neither site was utilized in the splicing of GPHe(P2) pre-mRNA. Rather, complete skipping of exon V and subsequent joining of exon IV to exon VI caused a shift in the open reading frame, which remodeled GPHe(P2) with an elongated new hydrophobic sequence for membrane anchoring. As a result, GPHe(P2) does not display the S and U epitopes although it still contains an intact linear sequence for the two antigens. These findings illustrate how exon and intron sequences concertedly determine the specificity of in vivo splice site selection. In addition, they pinpoint the conformational dependence of the S, s, and U antigens and the importance of the hinge region for their presentation."
https://openalex.org/W1602496180,"The irreversible inhibition of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2) proteases by 1,2-epoxy-3-(p-nitrophenoxy)propane (EPNP) and eight haloperidol derivatives has been studied. EPNP specifically inhibits HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases with a stoichiometry of one EPNP molecule/dimeric enzyme. The site of modification of HIV-2 protease by EPNP has been unambiguously identified as Asp-25 using high performance tandem mass spectrometry. The haloperidol derivatives assayed consist of epoxides, ynones, and alpha,beta-unsaturated ketones. The Kinact values for these haloperidol derivatives range from 10.7 to 521 microM for HIV-1 protease and from 8.6 to 283 microM for the HIV-2 enzyme, being in some cases approximately 1000-fold more potent irreverisble inhibitors of HIV proteases than EPNP. This potency results from the haloperidol character of the compounds and the chemical reactivity of the groups capable of forming a covalent bond with the enzyme. Covalent modification of HIV-2 protease by a radiolabeled epoxide derivative of haloperidol, UCSF 84, is prevented by EPNP and the peptidomimetic transition state analog U-85548. In similar experiments, incorporation of UCSF 84 into HIV-1 protease is partially prevented by these active-site inhibitors. In contrast, a mutant HIV-1 protease, HIV-1 PR C95M, in which Cys-95 has been replaced by Met, is labeled 50% less than HIV-1 protease and is fully protected by EPNP and U-85548. These results indicate the presence of 2 reactive residues in HIV-1 protease: Cys-95 and another located in the active site of the enzyme. The alpha,beta-unsaturated ketone derivative of haloperidol, UCSF 191, which is stable over a broad pH range, was used to study the pH profile of inactivation of HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases. Comparison of the profiles of inactivation of wild-type HIV-1 protease, HIV-1 PR C95M, and HIV-1 PR C67L as well as HIV-2 protease (which has no cysteine residues) reveals the contribution of Cys-95 to the reactivity of these irreversible inhibitors. The inhibitors UCSF 70, UCSF 84, UCSF 115, UCSF 142, and UCSF 191 reduce p55gag polyprotein processing when assayed in a mammalian cell line that produces HIV-1 viral particles lacking the envelope."
https://openalex.org/W2118995339,"The melanoma-inducing gene of Xiphophorus fish encodes the Xmrk receptor tyrosine kinase. Using a highly specific antiserum produced against the recombinant receptor expressed with a baculovirus, it is shown that Xmrk is the most abundant phosphotyrosine protein in fish melanoma and thus highly activated in the tumors. Studies on a melanoma cell line revealed that these cells produce an activity that considerably stimulates receptor autophosphorylation. The stimulating activity induces receptor down-regulation and can be depleted from the melanoma cell supernatant by the immobilized recombinant receptor protein. The fish melanoma cells can thus be considered autocrine tumor cells providing a source for future purification and characterization of the Xmrk ligand."
https://openalex.org/W1503817775,"The cysteine 763 residue in the C-terminal zinc-finger region of Escherichia coli UvrA protein was subjected to random mutagenesis, and the results suggested that the UvrA mutants with a small amino acid (Ser, Ala, or Gly) substituting for the cysteine 763 were almost as active as the wild-type in supporting nucleotide excision repair, but its replacement with a large, bulky amino acid (Tyr, Trp, or Phe) rendered the mutants inactive. The C763F mutant UvrA protein was purified for further characterization, and it was found this mutant UvrA protein lost its DNA binding (single-stranded or double-stranded DNA) activity and those other activities dependent on DNA binding, such as formation of damage-specific UvrA2B complexes and the supercoiling reaction. However, this mutant protein retained vigorous ATPase activity and was capable of negatively complementing the wild-type UvrA in JM109 strain. The purified C763F mutant UvrA protein contains a single zinc ion/molecule, half that of the wild-type. It appears that the C763F mutation destabilizes the zinc-anchored structure in the C-terminal zinc finger region, and as a result, the C763F mutant UvrA protein lost its ability to bind DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1621611538,"The TlpA protein encoded by the virulence plasmid of Salmonella enterica is an alpha-helical 371-amino acid protein possessing characteristics similar to eukaryotic coiled coil proteins (Koski, P., Saarilahti, H., Sukupolvi, S., Taira, S., Rikkonen, P., Osterlund, K., Hurme, R., and Rhen, M. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 12258-12265). In this paper we have investigated inter- and intramolecular associations and the morphology of structures formed by TlpA. Dynamics and temperature stability of TlpA dimers were studied by examining the feasibility and conditions in which TlpA would form an artificial heterodimer with its truncated derivative. Formation of heterodimers, bridged by Cu(2+)-catalyzed air oxidation of adjacent Cys residues, showed that TlpA dimers are dynamic chain exchanging structures at 37 degrees C, whereas they were nonexchanging at room temperature or on ice. Chemical cross-linking suggested higher order interaction between TlpA dimers. Electron microscopy studies revealed two levels of TlpA organization in vitro: thin filaments and rods, 2-5 nm in diameter, and a higher ordered filament network consisting of tonofilament-like formations with a diameter of 8-15 nm. Electron microscopy of thin-sectioned Escherichia coli over-producing TlpA showed an extraordinary intracellular assembly of proteinacious lamellae with a striated appearance and a 38-nm periodicity. This study describes for the first time a bacterial protein capable of organizing itself into an ordered and suspectedly dynamic intermediate filament-like architecture."
https://openalex.org/W1499911775,"There are six intramolecular disulfide (S-S) bonds that form during intracellular folding of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-beta subunit. Site-directed mutagenesis of every pair of Cys residues involved in the formation of each S-S bond was used to examine the roles that S-S bonds play in beta subunit folding and secretion. Tryptic maps of secreted hCG-beta showed that only one S-S bond formed in all S-S bond mutants that failed to fold from the earliest detectable beta folding intermediate, p beta 1, into a second major intermediate, p beta 2 (C34A-C88A, C38A-C57A or C9A-C90A mutants), whereas all 5 remaining S-S bonds formed in mutants when p beta 1–>p beta 2 conversion occurred (C23A-C72A, C93A-C100A, or C26A-C110A mutants). Nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that beta multimers were secreted from cells expressing S-S bond mutations where the folding of p beta 1–>p beta 2 was blocked. However, for mutations where p beta 1–>p beta 2 conversion was efficient, beta monomers rather than multimers were secreted. For all cell lines studied, secreted hCG-beta migrated as monomeric beta during reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, indicating that hCG-beta multimers formed via intermolecular cross-linking of unpaired thiols. Tryptic maps of hCG-beta isolated from mutants lacking the 34-88 bond, where > 80% turnover occurs, showed that only the 38-57 S-S bond formed. beta Subunits lacking the 9-90 linkage also have only S-S bond 38-57 formed, but"
https://openalex.org/W1498064066,"A reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 creates the Philadelphia (Ph1) chromosome in chronic myelogenous leukemia. This translocation results in the fusion of the ABL and the BCR genes to form a BCR/ABL fusion gene, the product of which has a greatly increased protein tyrosine kinase activity in comparison with the normal ABL protein. The chromosome 22 translocation breakpoints are concentrated within a 5.8-kilobase region named the major break-point cluster region (Mbcr). Gel mobility shift and DNase I footprinting assays have defined binding sites for three proteins, BIF 1-3 (BCR intron factors 1-3), lying within a 427-base pair fragment of the Mbcr. This 427-base pair fragment functions as a transcriptional silencer with both the BCR as well as a heterologous promoter. The silencing is position- and orientation-independent. The transcriptional effects are greatest in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells, decreased in HeLa and B-cells, and absent in T-lymphocytes. Gel mobility shift assays show a corresponding difference in pattern when the T-lymphocyte nuclear extract is compared with other cell lines. The Mbcr appears to contain a novel group of transcriptional silencers that share a common binding motif with a recently described suppressor in the mouse Adh-1 gene."
https://openalex.org/W1550458975,"Abstract The breakdown of phosphoenzyme (EP) of the Ca(2+)-ATPase from pig red blood cell membranes was studied at 37 degrees C by means of a rapid chemical quenching technique. When the enzyme was phosphorylated with [gamma-32P]ATP in media without added MgCl2, all the EP formed disappeared along two single exponential curves, a rapid one with k(app) = 90 +/- 10 s-1 and a slow one with k(app) = 0.7 +/- 0.3 s-1. The amount of EP involved in each reaction was close to 50% of the EP present at the beginning. Only EP of rapid breakdown could account for the steady-state hydrolysis of ATP observed under the same experimental conditions. ADP accelerated the slow reaction 45-fold (k(app) = 31 +/- 9 s-1) with K0.5 = 740 +/- 120 microM as if this reaction represented the decay of CaE1P, which donated its phosphate to water slowly in the forward direction and rapidly to ADP in the reverse direction of the cycle. Combination of Mg2+ with K0.5 = 26.3 +/- 5.0 microM at a single class of site in E1 before phosphorylation increased EP of rapid breakdown at the expense of ADP-sensitive EP so that, at nonlimiting concentrations of Mg2+ in the phosphorylation media, all EP decomposed at high rate. Rapid decomposition was observed even with enough CDTA to chelate most of the Mg2+ remaining from phosphorylation, suggesting that the role of Mg2+ during dephosphorylation was to accelerate the transition CaE1P-->CaE2P, preparing EP for hydrolysis. The combination of ATP at a single class of site with Km = 845 +/- 231 microM accelerated the hydrolysis of CaE2P. Calmodulin alone had no effects on dephosphorylation but enhanced acceleration of hydrolysis of CaE2P by ATP making the decay of EP under these conditions the fastest among those measured. Comparison of the rates of dephosphorylation of EP made in the presence of Mg2+ with those of steady-state Ca(2+)-ATPase activity with and without calmodulin showed that the transition CaE1P-->CaE2P and decomposition of CaE2P by hydrolysis are compatible with their role as obligatory intermediate reactions in the cycle of hydrolysis of ATP by the Ca(2+)-ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W2159864255,"We investigated the distribution of diether polar lipids between the inner and outer leaflets of the membrane of Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum comparing the orientation of tetraether polar lipids, which constitute a monolayer in the same membrane. Three kinds of reactions were employed for intact cells or protoplasts and unsealed membrane fragments prepared from the organism: glycosidase digestion for glycolipids, NaIO4 oxidation for glycolipids and inositol lipids, and trinitrophenylation for aminophospholipids. The results indicated that (a) most gentiobiose residues of both diether and tetraether polar lipids were exposed on the outside of the cells; (b) serine and inositol residues of both diether and tetraether polar lipids were mainly oriented to the cytoplasmic surface of the membrane; and (c) approximately 80% of archaetidylethanolamine (diether type) was distributed in the outer leaflet of the membrane bilayer, while only 25% of the ethanolamine residue of gentiobiosyl caldarchaetidylethanolamine (tetraether type) was oriented to the outer surface of the membrane. These results, except for ethanolamine lipids, are consistent with the hypothesis that the tetraether polar lipids are synthesized from the corresponding diether polar lipid precursors that have been already substituted by polar groups in the membrane by head-to-head condensation without rearrangement of lipids."
