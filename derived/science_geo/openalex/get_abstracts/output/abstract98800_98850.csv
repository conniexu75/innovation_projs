https://openalex.org/W2038978204,"By homologous recombination, we have generated mice that lack the neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) gene. Neuronal NOS expression and NADPH-diaphorase (NDP) staining are absent in the mutant mice. Very low level residual catalytic activity suggests that other enzymes in the brain may generate nitric oxide. The neurons normally expressing NOS appear intact, and the mutant NOS mice are viable, fertile, and without evident histopathological abnormalities in the central nervous system. The most evident effect of disrupting the neuronal NOS gene is the development of grossly enlarged stomachs, with hypertrophy of the pyloric sphincter and the circular muscle layer. This phenotype resembles the human disorder infantile pyloric stenosis, in which gastric outlet obstruction is associated with the lack of NDP neurons in the pylorus."
https://openalex.org/W2047916715,"The initial adhesive interactions between circulating leukocytes and endothelia are mediated, in part, by P-selectin. We now report the expression cloning of a functional ligand for P-selectin from an HL-60 cDNA library. The predicted amino acid sequence reveals a novel mucin-like transmembrane protein. Significant binding of transfected COS cells to P-selectin requires coexpression of both the protein ligand and a fucosyl-transferase. This binding is calcium dependent and can be inhibited by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody to P-selectin. Cotransfected COS cells express the ligand as a homodimer of 220 kd. A soluble ligand construct, when coexpressed with fucosyltransferase in COS cells, also mediates P-selectin binding and is immunocrossreactive with the major HL-60 glycoprotein that specifically binds P-selectin."
https://openalex.org/W1557874430,"The surface engagement of high affinity immunoglobulin E receptor (Fc epsilon RI) of rat basophilic leukemia 2H3 (RBL-2H3) cells induced histamine secretion and leukotriene release following activation of the tyrosine kinase Lyn together with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). Wortmannin inhibited the activity of partially purified PI3-kinase from calf thymus, as well as the PI3-kinase activity in anti-PI3-kinase p85 immunoprecipitates from RBL-2H3 cells, at a concentration as low as 1.0 nM and with IC50 values of 3.0 nM, but did not inhibit PI4-kinase activity. The inhibition of PI3-kinase by wortmannin was irreversible. Wortmannin inhibited both Fc epsilon RI-mediated histamine secretion and leukotriene release up to 80% with IC50 values of 2.0 and 3.0 nM, respectively. Wortmannin inhibited PI3-kinase activity in intact cells up to 80% with an IC50 value of 2.0 nM, which is almost equal to those for PI3-kinase in vitro and for histamine secretion and leukotriene release. With anti-wortmannin antibody, we have shown that wortmannin binds to the 110-kDa protein, but not to PI3-kinase 85-kDa regulatory subunit both in vitro and in whole cells. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between the potencies of wortmannin derivatives as inhibitors of PI3-kinase and as inhibitors of histamine secretion. Wortmannin had no effect on the activation of the tyrosine kinase Lyn. These results suggest that PI3-kinase is involved in the signal transduction pathway responsible for histamine secretion following stimulation of Fc epsilon RI and that wortmannin blocks these responses through direct interaction with the catalytic subunit of this enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1481362782,"Hs578T human breast cancer cells are from an estrogen receptor-negative breast cell line derived from a highly aggressive mammary tumor. Our previous insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) binding studies (Oh, Y., Muller, H. L., Lamson, G., and Rosenfeld, R. G. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 14964-14971) have demonstrated specific binding of IGFBP-3 on the Hs578T cell surface and a significant inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3, itself, on monolayer growth. In this study, we have demonstrated cell surface association proteins that are specific for IGFBP-3 by showing: 1) detection of 20-, 26-, and 50-kDa proteins by affinity cross-linking with 125I-IGFBP-3E. coli and immunoprecipitation of cell monolayers and cell lysates with anti-IGFBP-3 antibodies; 2) dose-dependent competition of 125I-IGFBP-3E. coli by unlabeled IGFBP-3E. coli; 3) inhibition of IGFBP-3 binding to these cell surface proteins by EDTA and by coincubation with native insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), but not by coincubation with [Gln6,Ala7,Tyr18,Leu19,Leu27]IGF-II, an IGF-II analog with decreased affinity for IGFBP-3; and 4) partial purification of 20- and 26-kDa species by IGFBP-3.anti-IGFBP-3 antibody immunoaffinity membranes. Characteristics of these specific IGFBP-3 cell surface association proteins are identical to those observed in our previous monolayer binding assay and monolayer growth assay experiments. The specificity of binding and the inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3 binding on Hs578T cell growth suggest that these cell surface proteins are IGFBP-3-specific receptors or receptor subunits mediating the direct inhibitory effect of IGFBP-3 on monolayer growth of Hs578T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062141980,"Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF; also known as cholinergic differentiation factor) is a multifunctional cytokine that affects neurons, as well as many other cell types. To examine its neuronal functions in vivo, we have used LIF-deficient mice. In culture, LIF alters the transmitter phenotype of sympathetic neurons, inducing cholinergic function, reducing noradrenergic function, and altering neuropeptide expression. In vivo, a noradrenergic to cholinergic switch occurs in the developing sweat gland innervation, and changes in neuropeptide phenotype occur in axotomized adult ganglia. We find that the gland innervation of LIF-deficient mice is indistinguishable from normal. In contrast, neuropeptide induction in ganglia cultured as explants or axotomized in situ is significantly suppressed in LIF-deficient mice. Thus, LIF plays a role in transmitter changes induced by axotomy but not by developmental interactions with sweat glands."
https://openalex.org/W1629000899,"The platelet plasma membrane is lined with a membrane skeleton composed of short actin filaments, actin-binding protein, spectrin, vinculin, and other unidentified proteins. It is connected to the outside of the cell through association with the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane receptors. In detergent-lysed platelets, cytoplasmic actin filaments are sedimented by centrifugation at 15,600 x g, but the sedimentation of membrane skeleton fragments requires higher g-forces (100,000 x g). In the present study, we show that the major platelet integrin, glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa, sediments from detergent-lysed platelets at 100,000 x g together with fragments of the membrane skeleton that contain the cytoskeletal proteins spectrin, vinculin, and talin. In addition, this cell fraction contained the tyrosine kinases pp60c-src and pp62c-yes and the p21ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP). After thrombin-induced platelet aggregation mediated by fibrinogen binding to GP IIb-IIIa on adjacent platelets, we detected a redistribution of spectrin, talin, vinculin, pp60c-src, and pp62c-yes to the fraction that sediments at 15,600 x g. The redistribution of these proteins from the high-speed detergent-insoluble fraction to the low-speed fraction correlated with the extent of aggregation and was not detected in aggregation-defective thrombasthenic platelets (which lack the GP IIb-IIIa complex). In addition, many of the proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine in activated platelets were present in detergent-insoluble fractions. These results are consistent with the possibilities that 1) GP IIb-IIIa, pp60c-src, pp62c-yes, and GAP associate with a membrane skeleton fraction that contains spectrin, vinculin, and talin, 2) the association of GP IIb-IIIa with adhesive ligand in a platelet aggregate causes components of the membrane skeleton to undergo altered association with cytoplasmic actin filaments, and 3) many of the proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in activated platelets are components of the cytoskeleton. The results imply that the membrane skeleton may play an important role in binding signaling molecules at sites of integrin-cytoskeleton interactions and in mediating signal transduction events in platelets. Further, GP IIb-IIIa-induced redistribution of components of the membrane skeleton and associated signaling molecules may represent an important step in regulating integrin-induced motile events in platelets."
https://openalex.org/W2059588956,"Secretagogues of rat peritoneal mast cells, such as mastoparan and compound 48/80, induce mast cell exocytosis by activating directly the guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins that are required for exocytosis. The introduction of a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the carboxyl-terminal end sequence of G alpha i3 into the cells specifically blocked this secretion. Similar results were obtained when antibodies to this peptide were introduced. The G alpha i3 was located in both the Golgi and the plasma membrane, but only the latter source of G alpha i3 appeared to be essential for secretion. These results indicate that G alpha i3 functions to control regulated exocytosis in mast cells."
https://openalex.org/W1970956968,"The protein CD36 is a membrane receptor for thrombospondin (TSP), malaria-infected erythrocytes, and collagen. Three functional sequences were identified within a single disulfide loop of CD36: one that mediates TSP binding (amino acids 87 to 99) and two that support malarial cytoadhesion (amino acids 8 to 21 and 97 to 110). One of these peptides (p87-99) is a consensus protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation site. Dephosphorylation of constitutively phosphorylated CD36 in resting platelets and a megakaryocytic cell line led to the loss of collagen adhesion and platelet reactivity to collagen, with a reciprocal increase in TSP binding. PKC-mediated phosphorylation of this ectodomain resulted in a loss of TSP binding and the reciprocal acquisition of collagen binding. In site-directed mutagenesis studies, when the threonine phosphorylation site was changed to alanine, CD36 was expressed in a dephosphorylated state and bound to TSP constitutively."
https://openalex.org/W1995862211,"Coexpression of the human Met receptor and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF), in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts causes the cells to become tumorigenic in nude mice. The resultant tumors display lumen-like morphology, contain carcinoma-like focal areas with intercellular junctions resembling desmosomes, and coexpress epithelial (cytokeratin) and mesenchymal (vimentin) cytoskeletal markers. The tumor cells also display enhanced expression of desmosomal and tight-junction proteins. The apparent mesenchymal to epithelial conversion of the tumor cells mimics the conversion that occurs during embryonic kidney development, suggesting that Met-HGF/SF signaling plays a role in this process as well as in tumors that express both epithelial and mesenchymal markers."
https://openalex.org/W2023947760,"NMU2, a nondifferentiating mutant myogenic cell line, gives rise to rhabdomyosarcomas in mice. We show that constitutive expression of RNA from 0.2 kb of the alpha-tropomyosin (Tm) 3' untranslated region (UTR), but not control 3'UTRs, suppresses anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation by NMU2 cells. When beta-galactosidase (beta-gal)-labeled cells were implanted into muscles of adult mouse hindlimbs, Tm 3'UTR expression suppressed the proliferation, invasion, and destruction of muscle tissues characteristic of NMU2. In the rare tumors that developed from Tm 3'UTR transfectants, RNA expression was extinguished. These results suggest that suppression of tumorigenicity is dependent on the continued expression of Tm transcripts lacking a coding region. We conclude that untranslated RNAs can function as regulators (riboregulators) that suppress tumor formation."

https://openalex.org/W1854945595,"The high-conductance Ca(2+)-activated K+ (maxi-K) channel from bovine tracheal smooth muscle was purified to apparent homogeneity by a combination of conventional chromatographic techniques and sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Fractions with the highest specific activity for binding of monoiodotyrosine charybdotoxin, [125I]ChTX, were enriched approximately 2000-fold over the initial digitonin-solubilized material up to a specific activity of 1 nmol/mg protein. Silver staining after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the fractions from the last step of the purification indicates that binding activity is correlated with a major component of the preparation that displays an apparent molecular weight of 62,000. Labeling the same preparation with 125I-Bolton-Hunter reagent reveals the existence of both 62 (alpha)- and 31 (beta)-kDa subunits, in an apparent stoichiometry of 1:1, comigrating with binding activity. The beta subunit is heavily glycosylated. Deglycosylation studies indicate that the beta subunit represents the protein to which [125I]ChTX is covalently incorporated in the presence of the bifunctional cross-linking reagent disuccinimidyl suberate. Binding of [125I]ChTX to the purified ChTX receptor displayed the same pharmacological profile that has been found previously for toxin binding to native membranes, including inhibition by iberiotoxin, limbatustoxin, tetraethylamonium, potassium, cesium, and barium. The purified preparation was reconstituted into liposomes which were then fused with artificial lipid bilayers. Single channels were readily observed with a conductance of 235 picosiemens in 150 mM KCl that displayed selectivity for potassium over chloride and that were blocked by ChTX. The open probability of these channels was increased by depolarizing membrane potentials and by raising the internal calcium concentration. These data suggest that the maxi-K channel purified from tracheal smooth muscle is composed of two subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2067804511,"Components of a signaling pathway that couples the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) receptor to induction of transcription were identified. CNTF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of p91, a protein implicated in interferon signaling pathways, and of two proteins that are distinct but related to p91. Tyrosine-phosphorylated p91 translocated to the nucleus, where p91 and p91-related proteins bound to a DNA sequence found in promoters of genes responsive to CNTF. This DNA sequence, when inserted upstream of a reporter gene, conferred a transcriptional response to CNTF. A pathway that transduces interferon signals may therefore have a more general function in the propagation of responses to certain neurotrophic factors."
https://openalex.org/W1569476889,"We report that osteopontin (OPN), a secreted, Arg-Gly-Asp-containing phosphoprotein expressed at high levels in the kidney, suppresses nitric oxide (NO) synthesis induced by the inflammatory mediators gamma-interferon and lipopolysaccharide in primary mouse kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells. Northern blot and immunofluorescence analyses of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression revealed that the inflammatory mediators increased iNOS mRNA and protein levels. Recombinant human OPN (purified from both mammalian cells and from Escherichia coli) inhibited this response by a process that was blocked by anti-OPN antiserum and by the peptide GRGDS, but not GRGES. The data suggest that inhibition of NO synthesis by OPN in these kidney cells is mediated by an integrin, possibly the alpha v beta 3 integrin, which is known to be an OPN receptor. NO is believed to control blood flow through the glomerulus, regulating salt and water balance, and to be important as a defense against tumor cells and infecting microorganisms. The ability of OPN to inhibit the induction of iNOS suggests that OPN may be an important regulator of the NO signaling pathway and NO-mediated cytotoxic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2085694005,"A cell culture system that supports the differentiation of male germ cells through meiosis is described. It takes advantage of the properties of a cell line, 15P-1, established from testicular cells of transgenic mice that express the large T protein of polyoma virus in the seminiferous epithelium. This line exhibits features characteristics of Sertoli cells, including transcription of the Wilms' tumor (WT1) and Steel genes. Cells of the 15P-1 type support the meiotic and postmeiotic differentiation in cocultures of diploid premeiotic germ cells into haploid spermatids expressing the protamine (Prm-1) gene. When cocultured with 15P-1 cells, testicular cells explanted from immature 9-day-old animals, before the onset of the first meiosis, generated tetrads of haploid cells with the morphology of round spermatids and initiated protamine transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1502902953,"We showed previously that hyaluronan (HA) synthesized by cultured fibroblasts firmly bound 85-kDa proteins. The proteins were derived from serum used for the culture and appeared to be covalently linked to HA (Yoneda, M., Suzuki, S., and Kimata, K. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 5247-5257). In these regards, we named this molecule SHAP (serum-derived HA associated proteins). Incubation of serum with exogenous HA under physiological conditions enabled us to prepare SHAP.HA complex without cell cultivation. The complex thus obtained from bovine or human serum was served for the characterization of SHAP. Digestion with HA-lyase and subsequent separation on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded two components, X and Y. Because of the block of their NH2 termini, peptides were obtained by the digestion of X and Y with V8 protease, separated on SDS-polyacryl-amide gel electrophoresis and then subjected to the analysis. Peptides from X and Y showed a high degree of sequence similarity to the two heavy chains, HC2 and HC1, of human inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor (ITI), respectively (over 80% with bovine SHAP and essentially 100% with human SHAP). Cross-reactivity with antibodies against ITI supported the findings. Direct digestion of the complex with V8 protease and the subsequent purification of the HA-resistant fragment complex were performed to identify the HA-binding domains. NH2-terminal sequences of the fragments suggested the participation of the COOH-terminal half of ITI with an amphipathic alpha helix structure in the HA binding."
https://openalex.org/W1484988735,"Abstract Alzheimer's disease is one of the prevalent forms of human dementia. Its pathology is distinguished by proteinaceous deposits (amyloid) in the brain. They contain a peptide (beta A4) that is proteolytically derived from a larger transmembrane protein. To follow the different metabolic pathways of this Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) may thus lead to the elucidation of the molecular basis of Alzheimer's disease. Specific antibodies are necessary tools for this task. Using synthetic peptides, we have characterized the epitope of the APP-specific monoclonal antibody 22C11; it is localized between residues 66 and 81 of APP. Some of the peptides flanking this site exhibited properties generally associated with amyloid, i.e. low solubility, filament formation, and birefringence after Congo Red staining. Exploiting differences in the peptides' aggregational properties, we present evidence that the two dyes Eosin and Direct Red 254, in conjunction with classical amyloid staining by Congo Red, can be used to characterize aggregating, amyloid-like peptides in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2049974772,Xlsirts are a family of interspersed repeat RNAs from Xenopus laevis that contain from 3 to 13 repeat units (each 79 to 81 nucleotides long) flanked by unique sequences. They are homologous to the mammalian Xist gene that is involved in X chromosome inactivation. Xlsirt RNA appears first in the mitochondrial cloud (Balbiani body) in stage 2 oocytes and is then translocated as island-like structures to the vegetal cortex at early stage 3 coincident with the localization of the germ plasm. Exogenous Xlsirt RNA injected into oocytes translocates to the location of the endogenous RNA at that particular stage. The Xlsirt RNA repeat sequences are required for translocation and can cause the translocation of heterologous unique RNAs to the vegetal cortex.
https://openalex.org/W2086323437,"Cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) is a persistent attenuation of the parallel fiber-Purkinje neuron (PF-PN) synapse induced by conjunctive stimulation of PF and climbing fiber (CF) inputs. A similar phenomenon is seen in the voltage-clamped PN in tissue culture when iontophoretic quisqualate application and PN depolarization are substituted for PF and CF stimulation, respectively. In this model, LTD induction requires activation of both AMPA and metabotropic receptors, together with PN depolarization. We have sought to determine the role of the AMPA receptor in LTD induction. The AMPA receptor does not appear to exert its effect by directly gating Ca2+ influx. Replacement of external Na+ during quisqualate/depolarization conjunction with permeant ions caused a blockade of LTD induction, suggesting that Na+ influx through the AMPA-associated channel is necessary for this process. Similarly, pairing quisqualate pulses with depolarizing steps near ENa also failed to induce LTD. The present results indicate that postsynaptic Na+ influx is necessary for LTD induction. While a portion of the relevant Na+ influx is provided by voltage-gated channels, the AMPA-associated ion channel is most important in this regard."

https://openalex.org/W2054778338,We show that the reverse transcriptase (RT) encoded by the Mauriceville mitochondrial plasmid of Neurospora closely resembles viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases in initiating cDNA synthesis opposite the penultimate C residue of a 3' tRNA-like structure and has the unprecedented ability for a DNA polymerase to initiate DNA synthesis at a specific site in a natural template without a primer. The Mauriceville plasmid enzyme can also use DNA or RNA primers in a manner suggesting how a primitive RT could have evolved from an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase into retroviral and other types of RTs. The characteristics of the Mauriceville plasmid RT suggest that it may be related to the progenitor of present-day RTs and DNA polymerases.
https://openalex.org/W1595536772,"A trypsin-like protease was purified from spent culture medium of oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis by chromatography on columns of DEAE-Sepharose, gel filtration on Sephadex G-100, and chromatofocusing on PBE-94. Purified enzyme showed a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with an estimated molecular weight of 55,000. Purified protease hydrolyzed type I, III, IV, and V collagen from human placenta, and type I collagen from rat tail and calf skin, but did not hydrolyze type II collagen from chicken sternal cartilage. The purified enzyme also hydrolyzed the C3 component of complement, fibrinogen, fibronectin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, apotransferrin, and human serum albumin. The hydrolytic activity of the purified enzyme on chromogenic substrates was limited to substrates with arginine in the P-1 position, although synthetic peptides were also cleaved at Lys-X linkage. The enzyme was activated by reducing agents dithiothreitol, L-cysteine, and glutathione and inhibited by cysteine protease inhibitors N-ethylmaleimide, iodoacetic acid, and iodoacetamide. The enzyme was also inhibited by trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), leupeptin, antipain, salivary histidine-rich protein (HRP-5), soybean trypsin inhibitor, and EDTA. Since the protease is able to degrade the connective tissue components of periodontal tissue as well as components of host defense mechanism, this enzyme may be a potent virulence factor of P. gingivalis involved in invasion and tissue destruction."

https://openalex.org/W1588537646,"Intestinal chloride (Cl-) secretion can be induced by the heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) from Escherichia coli via generation of cGMP. We investigated the regulatory pathway responsible for cGMP-mediated Cl- secretion in the human colonic carcinoma cell line Caco-2 using whole-cell voltage clamp techniques. Cyclic GMP or cAMP induced a 5-fold increase in Cl- conductance (gCl) in the presence of intracellular ATP and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Current activation by cGMP persisted in the presence of the type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) inhibitor, KT5823, but was inhibited by the specific peptide inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), PKI5-24. The stimulatory effects of cGMP and cAMP on gCl were not additive. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a Cl- channel that is regulated by intracellular ATP and by cAMP-dependent phosphorylation. In order to determine whether CFTR was involved in the cGMP-dependent increase in gCl, we tested the effect of intracellularly injected anti-CFTR505-511 antibodies previously shown to inhibit CFTR function. Antibodies introduced into individual cells via the patch pipette completely inhibited cGMP-dependent current activation. Cyclic GMP also failed to activate gCl in cystic fibrosis cells. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that activation of the CFTR via PKA-dependent phosphorylation accounts for the cGMP-mediated increase in Cl- secretion in Caco-2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581921347,"The mechanism of human immunodeficiency virus reverse transcriptase-catalyzed strand transfer synthesis (i.e. switching of the primer to a new template) from internal regions of natural sequence RNA was investigated. The system consisted of a 142-nucleotide RNA template (donor) primed with a specific 20-nucleotide DNA oligonucleotide used to initiate synthesis. DNA oligonucleotides with homology to internal regions of the donor were used as acceptor templates. In reactions performed in the absence of acceptor template, a prominent DNA synthesis product 75 nucleotides in length resulting from pausing DNA synthesis within the homology zone was observed. Prominent donor RNA degradation products of 47 or 54 nucleotides were also observed, in reactions with 80 or 150 mM KCl, respectively. The lengths indicated a potential 13- or 20-nucleotide long, respectively, complementary region between the DNA and RNAs. The 54-, but not the 47-, nucleotide RNA was susceptible to Escherichia coli RNase H, indicating that the DNA was annealed only to the 54-mer. When acceptor was added, a portion of the 75-nucleotide DNA was chased into transfer product at both salt concentrations, and a portion of the 54-mer RNA became resistant to E. coli RNase H. Evidently, this donor RNA was annealed to the 75-nucleotide long DNA but could be actively displaced by the acceptor. Overall, these observations support two mechanisms for transfer. In one, the pause site-specific DNA dissociates from the donor template before transferring. In the other, the acceptor actively displaces the DNA from the donor."
https://openalex.org/W1675393486,"We have previously provided evidence for a dual function of the adhesion molecule on glia (AMOG/beta 2), the beta 2 subunit of the murine Na,K-ATPase, both as neural recognition molecule mediating neuron-glia interactions and as functional beta subunit of the sodium pump. To analyze the functional role of AMOG/beta 2 in neurite outgrowth, AMOG/beta 2-expressing L-cells were generated by transfection and used as substrates for neurite outgrowth of cerebellar and hippocampal neurons. AMOG/beta 2-transfected L-cells led to an increase in neurite length after 6 h, which was specifically inhibited by antibodies to AMOG/beta 2 and a neuronal membrane fraction. Moreover, the extracellular domain of AMOG/beta 2 generated as a soluble recombinant protein in Chinese hamster ovary cells partially inhibited the increase in neurite outgrowth on AMOG/beta 2-transfected L-cells. L-cells transfected with the mouse beta 1 subunit had no effect on neurite extension. Our observations show for the first time differences in functional properties for different beta isoforms of the Na,K-ATPase and suggest that AMOG/beta 2 but not beta 1 is able to interact with an unknown neuronal receptor leading to increased neurite outgrowth, most likely via signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1546637315,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Golgi lumenal guanosine diphosphatase is hypothesized to generate GMP which in turn allows entry of GDP-mannose into the lumen to serve as substrate for mannosylation of proteins and lipids. We have recently shown in studies in vivo that this GDPase is required for protein and sphingolipid mannosylation in the Golgi lumen of S. cerevisiae. We have now isolated Golgi-vesicles from wild type and gda1 null mutants (GDPase defective) and have found that the initial rate of GDP-mannose entry into mutant vesicles was 5-fold lower than into those of wild type. Because the concentration of GDP within vesicles is insufficient to inhibit Golgi lumenal mannosyltransferases and the null mutant vesicles are impaired in synthesis of Golgi mannoproteins, the above results demonstrate that the reduced availability of GDP-mannose in the null mutants is the cause for altered Golgi mannosylation of macromolecules."
https://openalex.org/W1562527517,"Recently, the family of mammalian genes homologous to that for the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor has grown. One of the new family members, termed LDL receptor-related protein/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP/alpha 2MR), is one of the largest cell surface proteins characterized to date. Its functions have been hypothesized to include the plasma clearance of chylomicron remnants and activated alpha 2-macroglobulin, as well as the local metabolism of complexes between plasminogen activators and their endogenous inhibitors. Here we describe the molecular characterization of an LRP/alpha 2MR expressed in chickens, which do not metabolize chylomicron remnants. This chicken protein is expressed in somatic tissues and is different from a second LRP/alpha 2MR exclusively expressed in growing ovarian follicles. The sequence of the somatic cell-specific chicken LRP/alpha 2MR, deduced from cloned full-length cDNA, shows 83% overall identity with human LRP/alpha 2MR. Important characteristic features of the modular protein are completely conserved; in particular, all cysteine residues align perfectly. The avian LRP/alpha 2MR is post-translationally cleaved in the same fashion as its human counterpart, and the resulting 515-kDa extracellular subunit binds Ca2+, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and vitellogenin. The results indicate that avian LRP/alpha 2MR genes have emerged from an ancestor designed to ensure a pivotal event in the reproduction of oviparous species, i.e. vitellogenesis, and that mammalian LRP/alpha 2MRs have acquired features required for functioning in plasma clearance of certain non-yolk proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1589799362,"The pncB gene of Salmonella typhimurium was used to develop an overexpression system for nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRTase, EC 2.4.2.11), which forms nicotinate mononucleotide (NAMN) and PPi from nicotinate and alpha-D-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). NAPRTase hydrolyzes ATP in 1:1 molar stoichiometry to NAMN synthesis. Hydrolysis of ATP alters the ratio of products/substrates for the reaction nicotinate + PRPP NAMN + PPi from its equilibrium value of 0.67 to a value of 1100. The energy for the maintenance of this ratio must come from ATP hydrolysis. However, in contrast to other ATP-utilizing enzymes, when all ATP is hydrolyzed the unfavorable product/substrate ratio collapses. ATP/ADP exchange results suggest that the overall reaction involves a phosphoenzyme (E-P) arising from E.ATP. Km values for nicotinate and PRPP each decreased by 200-fold when ATP was present to phosphorylate the enzyme. PPi stimulated the ATPase activity of the enzyme to Vmax values, suggesting that PPi formation during catalysis provides a trigger for cleavage of the putative E-P in the overall reaction and regenerates the low affinity form of the enzyme. A model is presented in which alternation of high and low affinity forms of NAPRTase provides a steady-state coupling between ATP hydrolysis and NAMN formation."
https://openalex.org/W2416842399,"Shigella dysenteriae type 1 possesses an O-antigen whose repeating unit is -->3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->3)-alpha-L-Rhap-(1-->2)-alpha-D-Galp -(1-->3)-alpha-D- GlcpNAc-(1-->, where Rhap is rhamnopyranosyl, Galp is galactopyranosyl, and Glcp is glucopyranosyl. Using ligand-induced protein fluorescence change, we have measured the affinities of a monoclonal murine IgM for 26 fragments of, or related to, the structure of the O-polysaccharide and of the IgM Fab for the intact O-specific bacterial polysaccharide. Synthetic saccharides used were methyl glycosides to ensure an anomerically defined pyranosyl ring conformation. The galactosyl residue is the only monosaccharide of the antigenic epitope that shows quantifiable binding: approximately 3.0 kcal/mol of binding free energy, depending on the structure and conformation of the fragment it is a part of. Addition of an alpha-(1-->2)-linked rhamnosyl residue increases the free energy of binding significantly. We propose this rhamnopyranosyl-alpha-(1-->2)-galactopyranosyl disaccharide to be the basic determinant of the Shigella O-polysaccharide. Further extension (by linkages as in the natural antigen) of this oligosaccharidic ligand toward the upstream end (in an oligo- (or poly-)saccharide, such as A-->B-->C-->D-->E-->m, where A, B, C, D, and E are sugars and m is any moiety, such as methyl, we define A as the glycosyl- or upstream terminus, and E as the glycoside- or downstream terminus) by rhamnosyl and N-acetylglucosaminyl moieties improves the binding only minimally. The antibody is quite specific for the rhamnosyl-alpha-(1-->2)-galactosyl sequence but less so for the nature of the attachment to the galactosyl residue on the downstream side. Measurements using IgM Fab and the intact O-specific polysaccharide show that the antibody can bind internal segments on the antigen chain. The free energy of binding of this antibody for the disaccharide determinant varies from -delta G of 4.7 to 5.1 kcal/mol, depending on its flanking residues."
https://openalex.org/W1530427417,"We previously reported that the human keratin 19 (K19) gene was expressed in nonkeratinizing oral epithelial subtypes, and that the steady state K19 mRNA levels in different normal epithelial subtypes correlated with the levels of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) beta-mRNA (Hu, L., Crowe, D. L., Rheinwald, J. G., Chambon, P., and Gudas, L. J. (1991) Cancer Res. 51, 3972-3981). To elucidate the mechanisms by which the K19 gene is differentially expressed in various epithelial subtypes, we isolated phage containing human K19 genomic DNA from a human placental library. Through transient transfection assays with various K19/CAT constructs that contain different portions of K19 genomic DNA, an enhancer sequence has been identified in the K19 3'-flanking region. In normal human epithelial cell strains, the activity of this enhancer correlates with K19 mRNA abundance. This enhancer activates both the K19 and TK basal promoters in HeLa cells. A high level of K19/CAT fusion mRNA was detected when this K19 3' enhancer sequence was present at the 3' end of the fusion gene whereas no K19/CAT fusion transcript was detected if this 3' K19 enhancer sequence was absent, suggesting that the 3' K19 enhancer is crucial for the positive regulation of K19 expression. Deletion analysis has permitted the localization of the enhancer to a 19-base pair sequence which contains an AP1 binding site (AGTCATCT). Point mutations within this AP1 site completely abolished K19 enhancer activity in HeLa cells. Co-transfections of a c-jun expression vector with K19/CAT reporter constructs demonstrated that c-jun was able to activate the K19 promoter via the 3' K19 enhancer. Collectively, these data indicate that a cis-acting AP1 element and its associated trans-acting effector proteins regulate expression of lineage-specific genes in epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W1605633908,"Previously, Fe.bleomycin (BLM) has been shown to mediate RNA cleavage in a fashion more highly selective than that of DNA. Because RNAs often assume secondary and tertiary structures not commonly encountered with DNAs, it was not clear whether the greater selectivity of RNA cleavage was a consequence of differences in the mononucleotide constituents of RNA and DNA, or of the three-dimensional structures of the individual substrates. Accordingly, we prepared a identical in sequence with Bacillus subtilis tRNA(His) precursor, the latter of which is known to be a good substrate for Fe(II).BLM A2 and which undergoes oxidative cleavage predominantly at U35. Remarkably, the tDNA underwent cleavage predominantly at T35. At higher concentrations of Fe(II).BLM A2, the tDNA was extensively degraded, while the tRNA(His) precursor was not. Competition experiments suggested that this was not due to more efficient binding of Fe.BLM to the tDNA; in fact the tRNA precursor appeared to be bound more efficiently. The lesser cleavage of the tRNA(His) may be due to limitations in the facility of chemical transformation following Fe.BLM binding, or else to the formation of RNA lesions that do not lead directly to RNA strand scission."

https://openalex.org/W1560293937,"The mouse interleukin-3 (IL-3)-dependent hemopoietic precursor cell line 32DC13 responds to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) for proliferation and differentiation. We established a subline (32D-FH) of the 32DC13 cells which has lost the ability to respond to G-CSF. When murine G-CSF receptor cDNA was introduced into the 32D-FH cell line, the transformants responded to G-CSF as well as to IL-3 for proliferation. Adding G-CSF to the transformants rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation not only of the G-CSF receptor but also of both subtypes of the IL-3 receptor beta-chain (AIC2A and AIC2B molecules). On the other hand, stimulation of the transformants with IL-3 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the AIC2A and AIC2B but not of the G-CSF receptor. These results indicate that the tyrosine kinase activated through the G-CSF receptor interacts with the IL-3 receptor beta-chains but not vice versa. This unidirectional cross-phosphorylation between the G-CSF and IL-3 receptors may play a role in granulopoiesis induced by G-CSF."
https://openalex.org/W1573479070,"The major acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF)-stimulated phosphoprotein (MAFP) purified from bovine liver exhibits kinase, autoadenylylation, and alkaline nucleotide phosphodiesterase activities depending upon reaction conditions. In the presence of divalent ions, MAFP showed intrinsic and a FGF-stimulated kinase activities (autophosphorylation) using either [gamma-32P]ATP or [gamma-32P]GTP as a substrate. The autophosphorylation activity of MAFP was stimulated at low concentrations of Ca2+, Mg2+, or Mn2+ (0.2-2 microM). Depletion of the divalent ions by EDTA abolished the autophosphorylation activity but enhanced the autoadenylylation activity of MAFP. [alpha-32P]ATP as well as [alpha-32P]NAD could serve as substrates for autoadenylylation activity of MAFP. aFGF appeared to enhance the autoadenylylation activity of MAFP with an optimal concentration (0.6-1.2 nM). P1, P3-di(adenosine-5')-triphosphate (AP3A) was found to be a potent inhibitor for the autophosphorylation and autoadenylylation activities of MAFP. Analyses by automated Edman degradation of the adenylylated and phosphorylated peptides derived from autoadenylylated and autophosphorylated MAFP revealed that both autoadenylylation and autophosphorylation occurred at residue Thr204. The kinase and autoadenylylation activities of MAFP had an optimal pH of 6.9-7.4. However, at pH 8.9, MAFP showed intrinsic and aFGF-stimulated phosphodiesterase activities. aFGF appeared to stimulate the phosphodiesterase activity of MAFP without altering the Km (approximately 0.2 mM) of its substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1589729541,"In the rat testis, the vasopressin gene is transcribed into precursor RNAs that are processed into a number of mature transcripts. One of these transcripts has a structure identical to that of the hypothalamic RNA that encodes the vasopressin prepropeptide, but is present at such low levels that it can only be detected by the polymerase chain reaction. Other vasopressin-like RNAs are derived from differential splicing events that join transcribed sequences between 3 and 9 kilobases upstream of the hypothalamic transcription start site to exons corresponding to II and III of the hypothalamic-type RNA. Here we describe the sequence of a testis-specific promoter and the exon structure of its transcription unit. We show that an in vitro synthesized RNA corresponding to the longer testicular vasopressin gene-derived transcript is not able to act as a template for protein synthesis in two different cell-free lysates. As attempts to localize the vasopressin-gene derived RNAs to particular cell types in the testis by in situ hybridization have consistently failed, we have used indirect methods. Three different procedures were used to effect germ cell depletion in adult male rats. Acute heat treatment of the testis, chronic ingestion of hydroxyurea, and chronic vitamin A deficiency all reduced the level of the aberrant testicular vasopressin-gene derived RNAs, indicating that their expression is closely associated with the integrity of germ cells and ongoing spermatogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1551184646,"Protein HC (human complex-forming glycoprotein, heterogeneous in charge) is a member of the lipocalin superfamily of hydrophobic ligand-binding proteins. The quantitatively dominating blood plasma form of protein HC is a protein HC-IgA complex (HC-IgA), which is the fourth most abundant immunoglobulin species in plasma. A photodiode array detection system on-line with a high performance liquid chromatograph has allowed the identification of low amounts of a heterogeneous fluorescent chromophore covalently bound to HC-IgA, and displaying significant absorption in the visible region in resemblance to the free protein HC chromophore. Several structurally related chromophore-containing linked peptides, carrying 80% of the light absorption at 330 nm of HC-IgA, were isolated from a pepsin-produced protein HC-alpha 1-nonapeptide. Sequence analysis of these linked peptides demonstrated that the bond between protein HC and IgA represents a novel type of reduction-resistant linkage between polypeptide chains and involves the cysteine residue 34 of protein HC and the penultimate cysteine residue of the carboxyl-terminal part of one of the IgA heavy chains, as well as the heterogeneous fluorescent chromophore. The light absorption and fluorescent spectra of the chromophore-linked peptides were similar to those of native free protein HC."
https://openalex.org/W1508385249,"Nine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the 28-kDa subunit common to mu- and m-calpains have been assayed for their effects on mu- and m-calpains. All nine react with the COOH-terminal part (domain VI) of the 28-kDa subunit, and all nine affect the Ca2+ concentration required for autolysis of m-calpain, but have little effect on the Ca2+ concentration required for autolysis of mu-calpain. None of the nine affect the specific proteolytic activity of mu- or m-calpain. Two of the mAbs, 5B9 and 5B3, were selected for further study. mAb 5B9 decreased the Ca2+ concentration required for autolysis to one-fifth of that required in its absence; sequencing of chymotryptic fragments showed that the epitope for mAb 5B9 is between amino acid residues 92 and 104 of the 28-kDa subunit. mAb 5B3 increased the Ca2+ concentration required for autolysis; the epitope for mAb 5B3 is located between amino acid residues 148 and 178 of the 28-kDa subunit, which is the region that contains the first EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding sequence in this subunit. Although it increases the Ca2+ concentration required for autolysis, mAb 5B3 has no effect on the Ca2+ concentration required for proteolytic activity of m-calpain, and unautolyzed m-calpain is not a proenzyme. That all nine mAbs react with domain VI and not with the NH2-terminal domain V of the 28-kDa subunit suggests that domain VI (and not domain V) is involved in autolysis, contrary to the view that phosphatidylinositol lowers the Ca2+ concentration required for autolysis by binding to domain V."
https://openalex.org/W1545599710,"Many of the ribosomal protein (RP) genes in both bacterial and chloroplast genomes occur, for reasons not yet understood, in operons that include nonribosomal genes. Here we report such an operon organization in a cyanobacterium (Synechocystis PCC6803) involving the genes for four RPs that are important in the GTPase function of the ribosome and the aroC gene encoding chorismate synthase, a key enzyme in the shikimate pathway for biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids and cell wall components. The Synechocystis aroC encodes a 362-amino-acid residue protein which is 52, 60, and 68% identical to two eubacterial (both 52%), yeast, and a higher plant (Corydalis) chorismate synthase, respectively. The gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the gene product was shown to cross-react with antibodies to Corydalis chorismate synthase; it also complemented an aroC-lacking E. coli strain. The Synechocystis rpl1 and rpl11 genes encode polypeptides of 237 and 141 amino acid residues, respectively, also with high sequence identities to the corresponding RP sequences from other eubacteria and higher plant chloroplasts. The gene order is shown to be: rpl11-86bp spacer-rpl1-460bp spacer-rpl10-87-bp spacer-rpl12-206bp spacer-aroC. Southern and Northern blot analyses of Synechocystis DNA and RNA, respectively, revealed a single cluster of these genes per genome which is transcribed from a common promoter to an unusually long, approximately 9500-nucleotide transcript. Several constructs of the cyanobacterial aroC and rpl12 genes were made and expressed in E. coli to examine the mechanisms for their very differential expression from a polycistronic mRNA (e.g. four copies L12/ribosome; chorismate synthase, a non-abundant protein). These results present the first biochemical/molecular genetic evidence of shikimate pathway in the cyanobacterial group."
https://openalex.org/W1531633240,"Ras GTPase-activating protein (GAP) regulates the activity of Ras proteins, which have key roles in signal transduction pathways downstream of oncogenic and receptor tyrosine kinases. Previous studies indicated that Tyr-457 of bovine GAP (Tyr-460 of human GAP) is the major site of phosphorylation by viral Src (v-Src) kinase and epidermal growth factor receptor. The finding that Tyr-457 in GAP is located immediately adjacent to Src homology 2 (SH2) and 3 (SH3) domains led us to investigate the possibility that this specific phosphorylation regulates protein-protein interactions involving GAP. For this purpose, we constructed a full-length GAP mutant containing a substitution of Phe-457 in place of Tyr-457. Both wild-type GAP and mutant GAPF457 were tagged with the KT3 epitope at the carboxyl terminus and were expressed in v-Src transformed rat fibroblasts. In vivo phosphorylation analyses established that GAPF457 was weakly phosphorylated on tyrosine and, as expected, lacked the phosphopeptide containing Tyr-457. Analysis of GAP-associated proteins in anti-KT3 immunoprecipitates showed that GAP stably associated with two major phosphoproteins, p62 and p190, which have been previously described. Significantly, association of p62 with GAPF457 was reduced approximately 3-fold compared with wild-type GAP. Subcellular fractionation experiments further demonstrated that Tyr-457 phosphorylation of GAP stabilized its association with p62 at cell membranes. Based on these findings, we propose that one role of tyrosine phosphorylation in GAP is to enhance its association with p62 at membranes, which in turn may contribute to regulation of Ras signal transduction pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1482914407,"The epitopes of two neutralizing antibodies (47N3-6 and 47N30A35) raised against rhuIFN-gamma each mapped both to amino-terminal regions (22-29 and 12-19, respectively) and to a carboxyl-terminal region 131-139, suggesting the juxtaposition of these two domains in the native protein. Three novel peptides were designed to mimic a conformation of rhuIFN-gamma that places the two regions in close proximity (discontinuous peptides 1 (15-21-GGG-132-138), 2 (15-29...111-118...130-138), and 3 (15-21-CGPGC-130-138)), by bridging the amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of gamma interferon. Each discontinuous peptide inhibits biological or receptor binding activities with an IC50 of 15-50 microM and produces a neutralizing antibody when used as an immunogen. Neutralizing rabbit polyclonal antibody (P616) raised against discontinuous peptide 1 was used as immunogen to generate an anti-idiotypic response. This anti-idiotypic antibody inhibits receptor binding and recognizes soluble gamma interferon receptor on direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The anti-idiotypic response suggests that juxtaposed regions at the amino and carboxyl termini serve as the receptor-ligand binding site of human gamma interferon."
