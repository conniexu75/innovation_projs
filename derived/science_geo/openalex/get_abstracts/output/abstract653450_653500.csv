https://openalex.org/W3032474635,"Purposes During the outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) all over the world, the mental health conditions of health care workers are of great importance to ensure the efficiency of rescue operations. The current study examined the effect of social support on mental health of health care workers and its underlying mechanisms regarding the mediating role of resilience and moderating role of age during the epidemic. Methods Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Connor-Davidson Resilience scale (CD-RISC) and Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) were administrated among 1472 health care workers from Jiangsu Province, China during the peak period of COVID-19 outbreak. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to examine the mediation effect of resilience on the relation between social support and mental health, whereas moderated mediation analysis was performed by Hayes PROCESS macro. Results The findings showed that resilience could partially mediate the effect of social support on mental health among health care workers. Age group moderated the indirect relationship between social support and mental health via resilience. Specifically, compared with younger health care workers, the association between resilience and mental health would be attenuated in the middle-aged workers. Conclusions The results add knowledge to previous literature by uncovering the underlying mechanisms between social support and mental health. The present study has profound implications for mental health services for health care workers during the peak period of COVID-19."

In particular, we analyze the datasets of regional infected cases, derive the growth rates for regions characterized by a readable exponential growth phase in their evolution spread curve and plot them against the environmental temperatures averaged within the same regions, derive the relationship between temperature and growth rate, and evaluate its statistical confidence. The results clearly support the first reported statistically significant relationship of negative correlation between the average environmental temperature and exponential growth rates of the infected cases. The critical temperature, which eliminates the exponential growth, and thus the COVID-19 spread in US regions, is estimated to be TC = 86.1 ± 4.3 F0."
https://openalex.org/W3024349536,"Timing and rate of nitrogen (N) fertilizer application can influence maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield, N uptake, and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) parameters, but results have been inconsistent across the upper Midwest. This study compared single (fall and preplant) and split applications of differing N rates for maize under irrigated conditions on loamy sand at Becker, MN and under rainfed conditions on loam and clay loam soils at Lamberton, MN and Waseca, MN, respectively, in 2014 to 2016. Fall and preplant applications of N were applied at recommended and 125% of recommended rates (RN) according to University of Minnesota guidelines. Split-application treatments included a two-way (Sp, applied at 75% and 100% of RN) and a three-way split (TSp applied at 50%, 75%, and 100% of RN), with the total N rate equally split among application times. At Becker, maize grain yield with TSp was 12.6 to 15.7 Mg ha-1 among years and significantly greater than that with fall or preplant treatments. The TSp treatment also improved agronomic efficiency (AE) and recovery efficiency (RE) by an average of 30% over fall or preplant treatments. At Lamberton, maize grain yield, AE and RE did not differ among treatments. However, TSp75 improved AE by 8.3 kg kg-1 while producing comparable yields to fall and preplant treatments. At Waseca, Sp or TSp improved grain yield and AE compared with fall treatments. These results suggest that split applications of N can increase maize grain yield, AE, and RE on irrigated coarse-textured soils and applying N fertilizer near planting or as a split application can improve N management on non-irrigated clay loam soils."
https://openalex.org/W3028788875,"The Argentinian pouched lamprey, classified as Petromyzon macrostomus Burmeister, 1868 was first described in 1867 in De La Plata River, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and subsequently recorded in several rivers from Patagonia. Since its original description, the validity of P. macrostomus was questioned by several ichthyologists and 36 years after its original discovery it was considered a junior synonym of Geotria australis Gray, 1851. For a long time, the taxonomic status of G. australis has been uncertain, largely due to the misinterpretations of the morphological alterations that occur during sexual maturation, including the arrangement of teeth, size and position of fins and cloaca, and the development of an exceptionally large gular pouch in males. In this study, the taxonomic status of Geotria from across the ""species"" range was evaluated using both molecular analysis and examination of morphological characteristics.Phylogenetic and species delimitation analyses based on mitochondrial DNA sequences of Cytochrome b (Cyt b) and Cytochrome C Oxidase Subunit 1 (COI) genes, along with morphological analysis of diagnostic characters reported in the original descriptions of the species were used to assess genetic and morphological variation within Geotria and to determine the specific status of the Argentinian lamprey. These analyses revealed that Geotria from Argentina constitutes a well differentiated lineage from Chilean and Australasian populations. The position of the cloaca and the distance between the second dorsal and caudal fins in sub-adult individuals, and at previous life stages, can be used to distinguish between the two species. In addition, the genetic distance between G. macrostoma and G. australis for the COI and Cyt b mitochondrial genes is higher than both intra- and inter-specific distances reported for other Petromyzontiformes.Our results indicate that the Argentinian pouched lamprey, found along a broad latitudinal gradient on the south-west Atlantic coast of South America, should be named as Geotria macrostoma (Burmeister, 1868) and not as G. australis Gray 1851, returning to its earliest valid designation in Argentina. Geotria macrostoma can now be considered as the single lamprey species inhabiting Argentinian Patagonia, with distinct local adaptations and evolutionary potential. It is essential that this distinctiveness is recognized in order to guide future conservation and management actions against imminent threats posed by human actions in the major basins of Patagonia."
https://openalex.org/W3029386006,"Plant rhizosphere-associated bacterial communities play key roles in affecting host health in response to diverse biotic stresses. Currently, the effect of continuous cropping of potato on soil bacterial communities and physiochemical parameters has not been well documented. Herein, we compared bacterial composition and diversity in rotationally and continuously (5, 10, and 30 years) cropped soils, and clarified the correlations between soil properties and the bacterial communities revealed by Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Our results demonstrated that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes were the predominant phyla in all the tested soil samples. While the abundance of Proteobacteria showed an increase, the abundance of Actinobacteria and Firmicutes displayed a reduction with the increase of continuous cropping years. At the genus level, as continuous cropping years increasing, the abundance of Pseudarthrobacter, Bacillus and Pseudomonas decreased, but the abundance of Rhodanobacte, Sphingobium, Mizugakiibacter and Devosia increased. Our results also demonstrated that the abundance of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria in the rotationally cropped soil was significantly higher than that of continuously cropped soil. Furthermore, our results showed that soil organic matter, available nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium were significantly correlated with bacterial community distribution. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive view of altered structure and composition of bacterial communities between the continuously cropped soil and rotationally cropped soil."
https://openalex.org/W3031120274,"Eye temperature measured using infrared thermography (IRT) can be used as a non-invasive measure of autonomic nervous system (ANS) activity in cattle. The objective of this study was to evaluate if changes in eye temperature (measured using IRT) can be used to non-invasively measure ANS activity in sheep. Twenty, 2 to 4-year-old, Romney ewes were randomly assigned to receive either epinephrine (EPI) or physiological saline (SAL) for 5 min administered via jugular catheter (n = 10 ewes/treatment). Eye temperature (°C) was recorded continuously using IRT for approximately 25 min before and 20 min after the start of infusion. Heart rate and heart rate variability, measured using the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and the standard deviation of all inter-beat intervals (SDNN), were recorded for 5 min before and up to 10 min after the start of infusion. Blood samples were taken before and after the infusion period to measure plasma epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol and packed cell volume (PCV) concentrations. During the infusion period, maximum eye temperature was on average higher (P<0.05) in sheep that received epinephrine than those that received saline. On average, heart rate was higher (SAL: 87.5 beats/min, EPI: 123.2 beats/min, SED = 7.07 beats/min; P<0.05), and RMSSD (SAL: 55.3 ms, EPI: 17.3 ms, SED = 14.18 ms) and SDNN (SAL: 54.3 ms, EPI: 21.5 ms, SED = 10.00 ms) lower (P<0.05) in ewes during the 5 min post-infusion period compared with ewes that received saline. An infusion of epinephrine resulted in higher geometric mean epinephrine (P<0.05) and cortisol (P<0.05) but not norepinephrine (P>0.05) concentrations in ewes compared to an infusion of saline. PCV concentrations were higher (P<0.001) by 7 ± 1.0% (mean±SED) in ewes after an epinephrine infusion. These results suggest that heart rate variability is a sensitive, non-invasive method that can be used to measure ANS activity in sheep, whereas change in eye temperature measured using IRT is a less sensitive method."
https://openalex.org/W3030628883,"Helping the world’s coastal communities adapt to climate change impacts requires evaluating the vulnerability of coastal communities and assessing adaptation options. This includes understanding the potential for ‘natural’ infrastructure (ecosystems and the biodiversity that underpins them) to reduce communities’ vulnerability, alongside more traditional ‘hard’ infrastructure approaches. Here we present a spatially explicit global evaluation of the vulnerability of coastal-dwelling human populations to key climate change exposures and explore the potential for coastal ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change (ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA)). We find that mangroves and coral reefs are particularly well situated to help people cope with current weather extremes, a function that will only increase in importance as people adapt to climate change now and in coming decades. We find that around 30.9 million people living within 2km of the coast are highly vulnerable to tropical storms and sea-level rise (SLR). Mangroves and coral reefs overlap these threats to at least 5.3 and 3.4 million people, respectively, with substantial potential to dissipate storm surges and improve resilience against SLR effects. Significant co-benefits from mangroves also accrue, with 896 million metric tons of carbon stored in their soils and above- and below-ground biomass. Our framework offers a tool for prioritizing ‘hotspots’ of coastal EbA potential for further, national and local analyses to quantify risk reduction and, thereby, guide investment in coastal ecosystems to help people adapt to climate change. In doing so, it underscores the global role that conserving and restoring ecosystems can play in protecting human lives and livelihoods, as well as biodiversity, in the face of climate change."
https://openalex.org/W3031286016,"Obesity is a major public health concern worldwide including Bangladesh. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and associated risk factors of general and abdominal obesity in rural and urban women in Bangladesh.A total of 450 adult women aged ≥ 18 years were recruited from rural (n = 210) and urban (n = 240) areas of four administrative regions (Chattagram, Dhaka and Rajshahi and Sylhet) of Bangladesh. Both socio-demographic and anthropometric data were recorded in this study. WHO proposed cut-off values were used for the Asian population for defining general and abdominal obesity. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was applied to evaluate the risk factors of general and abdominal obesity for Bangladeshi women.Overall, the prevalence of general and abdominal obesity was 28% and 49%, respectively. Urban women had a significantly higher prevalence of both general and abdominal obesity (30.9% and 58.6%, respectively) than in the rural women (26.6% and 38.1%, respectively) (p<0.05 and p<0.01, respectively). As region comparison, the prevalence of general obesity was higher in the Dhaka region (39.3%) compared to the Chattragram (23.3%), Rajshahi (23.9%) and Sylhet (3.5%) regions. On the other hand, abdominal obesity was more frequent among participants in Sylhet (72.4%) and Dhaka regions (61.5%), compared to the Chattagram (27.4%) and Rajshahi (37.3%) regions. A wide variation has been observed on the prevalence of general and abdominal obesity in the different age groups of the four regions. In regression analysis, a high socioeconomic status (ref: low socioeconomic level), low education level (ref: higher education), low physical activity (ref: adequate physical activity) and middle age (ref: ≥ 30 years of age) were significant risk factors for general and abdominal obesity.The prevalence of general and abdominal obesity was higher among participants living in urban areas. Physical inactivity, middle age, high socioeconomic status and low education level were associated with the increased prevalence of general and abdominal obesity. Such a high prevalence of general and abdominal obesity is a health concern for Bangladeshi women; therefore, public awareness and effective health intervention strategies are needed to address these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3029701312,"Objectives The present study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanism how PFKP is regulated by BRCA1 and the clinical significance of PFKP in breast cancer. Methods MEF-BRCA1△/△ and the wild type counterpart MEF-BRCA1+/+ cell lines were used to test the sensitivity of glucose depletion in culture medium. Glucose Assay Kit was used to quantify glucose levels in cultural supernatant and cell lysate. Real time PCR was used to measure the mRNA expression levels of genes. Western blot was used to detect protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was used to verify the bindings between transcription factors and DNA elements. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine the transcriptional activity. Histochemistry assay was performed on tissue microarray. Results We found that MEF-BRCA1△/△ cells consumed more glucose and were more vulnerable to glucose-deprived culture medium. The mRNA profiles and qPCR assay of MEF-BRCA1△/△ and MEF-BRCA1+/+ cells revealed that PFKP, the rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis, was significantly upregulated in MEF-BRCA1△/△ cells. Consistently, the repressive effects of BRCA1 on PFKP were confirmed by overexpression or knockdown of BRCA1. Moreover, we also demonstrated that PFKP was suppressed by ZBRK1 as well, which was the co-repression partner of BRCA1. Mechanistically, we figured out that BRCA1 formed a transcriptional repression complex with ZBRK1 on the promoter of PFKP and consequently restrained its expression. Importantly, the expression levels of PFKP were demonstrated to associate with poor survival of patients with breast cancer. Conclusion Our study provided a new insight into the dysregulation of glycolysis in breast cancer, which might be partially due to the deficiency of BRCA1/ZBRK1 axis and subsequently reversed the transcriptional repressive effect on PFKP. We also found that PFKP overexpressed in a subset of breast cancer patients and could serve as a prognostic factor, which represented a potential target for BC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3031029279,"Background Birth interval duration is an important and modifiable risk factor for adverse child and maternal health outcomes. Understanding the spatial distribution of short birth interval, an inter-birth interval of less than 33 months, and its predictors are vital to prioritize and facilitate targeted interventions. However, the spatial variation of short birth interval and its underlying factors have not been investigated in Ethiopia. Objective This study aimed to assess the predictors of short birth interval hot spots in Ethiopia. Methods The study used data from the 2016 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey and included 8,448 women in the analysis. The spatial variation of short birth interval was first examined using hot spot analysis (Local Getis-Ord Gi* statistic). Ordinary least squares regression was used to identify factors explaining the geographic variation of short birth interval. Geographically weighted regression was used to explore the spatial variability of relationships between short birth interval and selected predictors. Results Statistically significant hot spots of short birth interval were found in Somali Region, Oromia Region, Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples’ Region and some parts of Afar Region. Women with no education or with primary education, having a husband with higher education (above secondary education), and coming from a household with a poorer wealth quintile or middle wealth quintile were predictors of the spatial variation of short birth interval. The predictive strength of these factors varied across the study area. The geographically weighted regression model explained about 64% of the variation in short birth interval occurrence. Conclusion Residing in a geographic area where a high proportion of women had either no education or only primary education, had a husband with higher education, or were from a household in the poorer or middle wealth quintile increased the risk of experiencing short birth interval. Our detailed maps of short birth interval hot spots and its predictors will assist decision makers in implementing precision public health."
https://openalex.org/W3032160693,"Increasing physicians' awareness is one of the main ways to improve early diagnosis of rare diseases. A survey among physicians of different specialties to evaluate the knowledge about primary immunodeficiencies (PID) was conducted in 2016 and in 2019 -before and after the implementation of an educational program. We compare responses from 82 doctors who participated in the 2016 survey, and 67 doctors who have taken part in the survey in 2019: pediatricians, general practitioners / family physicians and physicians of pediatric sub specialties. The percentage of correct answers to all survey questions after the implementation of the educational program has significantly increased (79.0% in 2019 versus 58.3% in 2016, P<0.0001). This increase in the percentage of correct answers was noted among the surveyed doctors of all specialties. Particular progress was found among pediatricians, who have achieved more than 80% of correct answers. In 2019 the doctors demonstrated better knowledge on the warning signs of PID and specific features of Nijmegen breakage syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome and ataxia-telangiectasia syndrome. Thus, the implementation of an educational program improved physicians' awareness of PIDs, and will contribute to early detection of PIDs and their medical care."
https://openalex.org/W3029117827,"American households discard a significant amount of food that represent a sizable portion of their food expenditures. This study adds to our understanding of product attributes associated with food waste, with a focus on cosmetic deterioration during home storage. Specifically, we profile a sample of U.S. individuals by patterns of common food-related behaviors and determine the effects of product attributes on food waste tendencies at the point of consumption by distinct behavioral profiles. An interactive survey at the Minnesota State Fair (N = 333) was used to obtain measurements on food-related behavior and sociodemographic factors. The survey included a conjoint task to elicit food discard tendencies to construct the food waste proxy. The study considered cosmetic deterioration, date labels, implied shelf life, package size, and prices paid, in fresh, packaged spinach and ground beef products. Factor analysis and latent class modeling categorized the sample into two classes, revealing distinct food-related behavioral patterns. Planners, who constituted a slight majority in our sample, were likely to have established pre-shopping and in-store behavior and food management and cooking skills. Extemporaneous Consumers had inferior food handling routines and were less knowledgeable and skilled in the kitchen. Regression analysis using a random-effects tobit model showed Extemporaneous Consumers were prone to waste a greater portion of the spinach product than Planners. Otherwise, both classes showed similar increases in likelihood to discard the products, as their appearance deteriorated. Their tendency to waste increased with shorter remaining shelf life for spinach but not for ground beef, and was not affected by the date label type. Results suggest an intervention that targets a general audience designed to enhance people's skills to discern edibility of food in home storage by manipulating sensory expectations from cosmetic deterioration could be impactful in efforts to curtail food waste."
https://openalex.org/W3032371537,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a severe inherited disorder of cortisol biosynthesis that is potentially lethal or can seriously affect quality of life. For the first time, we aimed to assess the stability of 21-deoxycortisol (21Deox), 11-deoxycortisol (11Deox), 4-androstenedione (4AD), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) and cortisol (Cort), diagnostic for CAH, in dried blood spots (DBSs) during a 1 year storage at different temperatures. Spiked DBS samples were stored at room temperature, 4 °C, -20 °C or -70 °C, respectively and analyzed in triplicates using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry at Weeks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4, Month 6 and Year 1. Analyte levels within ±15% vs the baseline were considered stable. Our observations show that 21Deox, 4AD and 17OHP were not significantly changed for 1 year even at room temperature at either analyte levels. In contrast, Cort required storage at 4 °C, -20 °C or -70 °C for long-term stability, being significantly decreased at room temperature from Month 6 (p<0.01) in both the 30(60) nM and the 90(180) nM samples. 11Deox was significantly decreased at room temperature at Year 1 (p<0.01) and only in the 30(60) nM samples. Thus, all biomarkers were stable for up to 1 year at 4 °C, -20 °C or -70 °C and at least for 4 weeks at room temperature. These findings have implications for analyses of stored DBS samples in 2nd-tier assays in newborn screening and for retrospective CAH studies."
https://openalex.org/W3032281827,"Metastasis is known as a key step in cancer recurrence and could be stimulated by multiple factors. Calumenin (CALU) is one of these factors which has a direct impact on cancer metastasis and yet, its underlined mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. The current study was aimed to identify CALU co-expressed genes, their signaling pathways, and expression status within the human cancers. To this point, CALU associated genes were visualized using the Cytoscape plugin BisoGenet and annotated with the Enrichr web-based application. The list of CALU related diseases was retrieved using the DisGenNet, and cancer datasets were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and analyzed with the Cufflink software. ROC curve analysis was used to estimate the diagnostic accuracy of DEGs in each cancer, and the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to plot the overall survival of patients. The protein level of the signature biomarkers was measured in 40 biopsy specimens and matched adjacent normal tissues collected from CRC and lung cancer patients. Analysis of CALU co-expressed genes network in TCGA datasets indicated that the network is markedly altered in human colon (COAD) and lung (LUAD) cancers. Diagnostic accuracy estimation of differentially expressed genes showed that a gene panel consisted of CALU, AURKA, and MCM2 was able to successfully distinguish cancer tumors from healthy samples. Cancer cases with abnormal expression of the signature genes had a significantly lower survival rate than other patients. Additionally, comparison of CALU, AURKA, and MCM2 proteins between healthy samples, early and advanced tumors showed that the level of these proteins was increased through normal-carcinoma transition in both types of cancers. These data indicate that the interactions between CALU, AURKA, and MCM2 has a pivotal role in cancer development, and thereby needs to be explored in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3030109063,"White matter abnormalities are well-established in adult patients with psychosis. Less is known about abnormalities in the rarely occurring adolescent early onset psychosis (EOP). In particular, whether antipsychotic medication might impact white matter microstructure is not known. Using 3T diffusion weighted imaging, we investigated differences in white matter microstructure and the impact of antipsychotic medication status in medicated (n = 11) and unmedicated (n = 11) EOP patients relative to healthy controls (n = 33), aged between 12–18 years. Using Tract-based Spatial Statistics, we calculate case-control differences in scalar diffusion measures, i.e. fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusion (AD) and radial diffusion (RD), and investigated their association with antipsychotic medication in patients. We found significantly lower FA in the left genu of the corpus callosum, the left anterior corona radiata (ACR) and the right superior longitudinal fasciculus in EOP patients relative to healthy controls. AD values were also lower in the left ACR, largely overlapping with the FA findings. Mean FA in the left ACR was significantly associated with antipsychotic medication status (Cohen's d = 1.37, 95% CI [0.01, 2.68], p = 0.008), showing higher FA values in medicated compared to unmedicated EOP patients. The present study is the first to link antipsychotic medication status to altered regional FA in the left ACR, a region hypothesized to contribute to the etiology of psychosis. Replications are warranted to draw firm conclusions about putatively enhancing effects of antipsychotic medication on white matter microstructure in adolescent-onset psychosis."

The aim of this study is to develop and examine the psychometric properties of a new instrument, called the Digital Difficulties Scale (DDS). A multi-phase method was performed to develop the questionnaire in the period from January 2019 to November 2019. The item pool was generated based on a literature review, informal observations and interviews. Then, this item pool was presented both to experts (n = 6) and non-experts (n = 492) to assess content and face validity. In a second stage, construct validity (both exploratory and confirmatory), convergent and divergent validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability of the questionnaire were tested. These analyses were based on a representative sample (n = 1000), and an independent sample for test-retest reliability (n = 44). Twenty-four items were generated and refined during content and face validity assessment. The exploratory factor analysis revealed three factors (Specific Digital Difficulties, General Digital Difficulties, and Worries about Future Digital Difficulties) containing sixteen items, together explaining 73.03% of the observed variance. The confirmatory factor analysis proved adequate model fitness. Both convergent and divergent validity were good, and internal consistency was excellent, with Cronbach’s alphas ranging between .93 and .97. Finally, our instrument demonstrated good test-retest reliability, with interclass correlation coefficients between .73 and .86. Consequently, the DDS can be used both in future research and practice, as it is a valid and reliable instrument to measure who is disadvantaged to fulfill basic needs by experiencing difficulties in using a smartphone or computer."

Previously, we have shown that RNAs transfer is dependent on F-actin cytoskeleton and Myosin Va. Here, we explored the contribution of microtubules to newly synthesized RNAs transport from Schwann cell nuclei up to nodal microvilli in sciatic nerves. Results using immunohistochemistry and quantitative confocal FRET analysis indicate that Schwann cell-derived RNAs co-localize with microtubules in Schwann cell cytoplasm. Additionally, transport of Schwann cell-derived RNAs is nocodazole and colchicine sensitive demonstrating its dependence on microtubule network integrity. Moreover, mRNAs codifying neuron-specific proteins are among Schwann cell newly synthesized RNAs population, and some of them are associated with KIF1B and KIF5B microtubules-based motors."
https://openalex.org/W3030698319,"Background Despite research on the dramatic changes in marriage, there is a dearth of research on the correlates of marriage and romantic involvement among older African Americans. This is an important omission because although the marriage decline is universal, African Americans show the steepest decline in marriage rates. Methods Based on data from the National Survey of American Life, multinomial logistic regression analysis is used to identify demographic and health correlates of: 1) being married or cohabiting, 2) having a romantic involvement, 3) not having a romantic involvement but desiring one, and lastly, 4) not having and not desiring a romantic involvement. Results Four in 10 older African Americans are either married or cohabiting, 11% are unmarried but romantically involved, 9.5% are unmarried and not romantically involved but open to the possibility of a relationship, and 38% neither have nor desire a romantic involvement. More men than women are married or cohabiting, a gap that increases with advanced age. Across all age groups, African American women are more likely than their male counterparts to report that they neither have nor desire a romantic relationship. Conclusion Almost as many older African Americans do not want a romantic relationship as those who are married/cohabiting. Findings support social exchange theories and the importance of an unbalanced sex ratio. Furthermore, the results suggest that singlehood among older African Americans (especially women) is not necessarily an involuntary status. Nonetheless, this group is at higher risk of economic and health problems as they age."
https://openalex.org/W3031277786,"Naturally growing vegetation often suffers from the effects of drought. There exists a vast number of drought indices (DI's) to assess the impact of drought on the growth of crops and naturally occurring vegetation. However, assessing the fitness of these indices for large areas with variable vegetation cover is often problematic because of the absence of adequate spatial information. In this study, we compared six DI's to NDVI (the normalized difference vegetation index), a common indicator of vegetation occurrence and health based on satellite-acquired reflectance data. The study area covers an aridity gradient from forests to deserts along a 2,400-km-long section across the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. On an annual timescale, standardized precipitation index (SPI) was the most appropriate in assessing drought in steppes and deserts. On a seasonal timescale, the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index (scPDSI) displayed the greatest sensitivity during the summer, but not during the other seasons. On a monthly timescale, scPDSI demonstrated the greatest sensitivity to the various vegetation zones (i.e., forests, steppes, and deserts) in June and July. Further analysis indicated that summer drought had a lag-effect on vegetation growth, which varied from one to six months according to the specific vegetation cover. The mixed response of DI's to NDVI and the lag-effect in transitional vegetation on annual, seasonal, and monthly timescales were ascribed to differences in DI definition and the dominant plant species within the transitional cover. The current study has the potential to inform the drafting of selection criteria of DI's for the study of drought-related impact on naturally growing vegetation at timescales from month to year."
https://openalex.org/W3029764816,"We investigated the effects of long-term exposure to literary and popular fiction on attributional complexity, egocentric bias and accuracy. Results of a pre-registered study showed that exposure to literary fiction is positively associated with scores on the attributional complexity scale. Literary fiction is also associated with accuracy in mentalizing, measured via the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test, and with accuracy in predicting average social attitudes. The predicted negative association between literary fiction and egocentric bias emerged only when education and gender were controlled for–a covariance analysis that was not pre-registered. Exposure to popular fiction is associated solely with attributional complexity, but negatively. We discuss the significance of these findings in the context of the emerging literature regarding the relationship between fiction and social cognition."
https://openalex.org/W3030719766,"Paired associative stimulation (PAS) combines transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) to induce plastic changes in the corticospinal tract. PAS employing single 0.2-Hz TMS pulses synchronized with the first pulse of 50–100 Hz PNS trains potentiates motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in a stable manner in healthy participants and enhances voluntary motor output in spinal cord injury (SCI) patients. We further investigated the impact of settings of this PAS variant on MEP potentiation in healthy subjects. In experiment 1, we compared 0.2-Hz vs 0.4-Hz PAS. In experiment 2, PNS frequencies of 100 Hz, 200 Hz, and 400 Hz were compared. In experiment 3, we added a second TMS pulse. When compared with 0.4-Hz PAS, 0.2-Hz PAS was significantly more effective after 30 minutes (p = 0.05) and 60 minutes (p = 0.014). MEP potentiation by PAS with 100-Hz and 200-Hz PNS did not differ. PAS with 400-Hz PNS was less effective than 100-Hz (p = 0.023) and 200-Hz (p = 0.013) PNS. Adding an extra TMS pulse rendered PAS strongly inhibitory. These negative findings demonstrate that the 0.2-Hz PAS with 100-Hz PNS previously used in clinical studies is optimal and the modifications employed here do not enhance its efficacy."

NHE1 is the primary regulator of pH in the central nervous system. The goal of the current study was to investigate the role of sodium-hydrogen exchanger type 1 (NHE1) in blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity during CSD events and the contributions of this antiporter on xenobiotic uptake. Using immortalized cell lines, pharmacologic inhibition and genetic knockdown of NHE1 mitigated the paracellular uptake of radiolabeled sucrose implicating functional NHE1 in BBB maintenance. In contrast, loss of functional NHE1 in endothelial cells facilitated uptake of the anti-migraine therapeutic, sumatriptan. In female rats, cortical KCl but not aCSF selectively reduced total expression of NHE1 in cortex and PAG but increased expression in trigeminal ganglia; no changes were seen in trigeminal nucleus caudalis. Thus, in vitro observations may have a significance in vivo to increase brain sumatriptan levels. Pharmacological inhibition of NHE1 prior to cortical manipulations enhanced the efficacy of sumatriptan at early time-points but induced facial sensitivity alone. Overall, our results suggest that dysregulation of NHE1 contributes to breaches in BBB integrity, drug penetrance, and the behavioral sensitivity to the antimigraine agent, sumatriptan."
https://openalex.org/W3032728957,"Benzoxazinoids (BXs) are secondary metabolites with diverse functions, but are primarily involved in protecting plants, mainly from the family Poaceae, against insects and fungal pathogens. Rye is a cereal crop that is highly resistant to biotic stresses. However, its susceptibility to brown rust caused by Puccinia recondita f. sp. secalis (Prs) is still a major problem affecting its commercial production. Additionally, the genetic and metabolic factors related to this disease remain poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated whether and to what extent the brown rust infection and the inoculation procedure affect the contents of specific BXs (HBOA, GDIBOA, DIBOA, GDIMBOA, DIMBOA, and MBOA) and the expression of genes related to BX (ScBx1–5, ScIgl, and Scglu). We revealed that treatments with water and a urediniospore suspension usually downregulate gene expression levels. Moreover, HBOA and DIBOA contents decreased, whereas the contents of the remaining metabolites increased. Specifically, the MBOA content increased more after the mock treatment than after the Prs treatment, whereas the increase in GDIBOA and GDIMBOA levels was usually due to the Prs infection, especially at two of the most critical time-points, 17 and 24 h post-treatment. Therefore, GDIBOA and GDIMBOA are glucosides that are important components of rye defence responses to brown rust. Furthermore, along with MBOA, they protect rye against the stress associated with the inoculation procedure used in this study."
https://openalex.org/W3028830314,"In the Danio species, interspecific hybridization has been conducted in several combinations. Among them, only the hybrid between a zebrafish (D. rerio) female and a spotted danio (D. nigrofasciatus) male was reported to be fertile. However, beyond these investigations, by means of reproductive biology, gametes of the hybrid have also not been investigated genetically. For this study, we induced a hybrid of the D. rerio female and D. nigrofasciatus male in order to study its developmental capacity, reproductive performance and gametic characteristics. Its hybrid nature was genetically verified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the rhodopsin gene. Almost all the hybrids (36/37) were males, and only one was female. Developing oocytes were observed in the hybrid female, but ovulated eggs have not been obtained thus far. Microscopic observation revealed various head sizes of sperm in the hybrid males. Flow cytometry showed that the hybrid males generated aneuploid sperm with various ploidy levels up to diploidy. In backcrosses between D. rerio females and hybrid males, fertilization rates were significantly lower than the control D. rerio, and most resultant progeny with abnormal appearance exhibited various kinds of aneuploidies ranging from haploidy to triploidy, but only one viable progeny, which survived more than four months, was triploid. This suggested the contribution of fertile diploid sperm of the hybrid male to successful fertilization and development."
https://openalex.org/W3029772962,"As members of a university community that sponsors animal research, we developed a survey to improve our knowledge about factors underlying the perceived justifiability of animal research among faculty and undergraduate students. To accomplish this objective, we gathered quantitative data about their general views on animal use by humans, their specific views about the use of different species to address different categories of scientific questions, and their confidence in the translatability of animal research to humans. Students and faculty did not differ in their reported levels of concern for the human use of animals, but women reported significantly higher levels of concern than men. Among students, experience with animal research was positively correlated with less concern with animal use, and having practiced vegetarianism or veganism was associated with more concern. Gender, experience with animal research, and dietary preferences were similarly correlated with the extent of justifiability of animal use across all research purposes and species. Faculty responses resembled those for students, with the exception that justifiability varied significantly based on academic discipline: biological sciences faculty were least concerned about human use of animals and most supportive of animal research regardless of purpose or species. For both students and faculty, justifiability varied depending on research purpose or animal species. Research purposes, ranked in order of justifiability from high to low, was animal disease, human disease, basic research, human medicine, animal production, chemical testing, and cosmetics. Justifiability by purpose was slightly lower for students than for faculty. Species justifiability for students, from high to low, was small fish, rats or mice, pigs or sheep, monkeys, and dogs or cats. Faculty order was the same except that monkeys and dogs or cats were reversed in order. Finally, confidence in the translatability of animal research to our understanding of human biology and medicine was not different between students and faculty or between genders, but among faculty it was highest in biological sciences followed by physical sciences, social sciences, and then arts and humanities. Those with experience in animal research displayed the most confidence, and vegetarians/vegans displayed the least. These findings demonstrate that, although the range of views in any subcategory is large, views about animal research justifiability can vary significantly among respondent subpopulations in predictable ways. In particular, research purpose and choice of animal species are important variables for many people. This supports the claim that ensuring purpose and species are robustly integrated into research proposal reviews and approvals should be considered to be a best practice. We suggest that strengthening this integration beyond what is described in current regulations would better meet the justifiability criteria expressed by members of our campus community."
https://openalex.org/W3031144409,"Objective To determine the yield of tuberculosis (TB) and the prevalence of Human Immuno-deficiency virus (HIV) among key populations in the selected hotspot towns of Ethiopia. Methods We undertook a cross-sectional implementation research during August 2017-January 2018. Trained TB focal persons and health extension workers (HEWs) identified female sex workers (FSWs), health care workers (HCWs), prison inmates, homeless, internally displaced people (IDPs), internal migratory workers (IMWs) and residents in missionary charities as key and vulnerable popuaiton. They carried out health education on the importance of TB screening and HIV testing prior to recruitment of the study participants. Symptomatic TB screening and HIV testing was done. The yield of TB was computed per 100,000 background key population. Results A total of 1878 vulnerable people were screened, out of which 726 (38.7%) presumptive TB cases and 87 (4.6%) TB cases were identified. The yield of TB was 1519 (95% CI: 1218.1–1869.9). The highest proportion (19.5%) and yield of TB case (6,286 (95% CI: 3980.8–9362.3)) was among HCWs. The prevalence of HIV infection was 6%, 67 out of 1,111 tested. IMWs and FSWs represented 49.3% (33) and 28.4% (13) of the HIV infections, respectively. There was a statistically significant association of active TB cases with previous history of TB (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 11 95% CI, 4.06–29.81), HIV infection (AOR: 7.7 95% CI, 2.24–26.40), and being a HCW (AOR: 2.42 95% CI, 1.09–5.34). Conclusions The prevalence of TB in key populations was nine times higher than 164/100,000 national estimated prevalence rate. The prevalence of HIV was five times higher than 1.15% of the national survey. The highest yield of TB was among the HCWs and the high HIV burden was detected among the FSWs and IMWs. These suggest a community and health facility based integrated and enhanced case finding approaches for TB and HIV in hotspot settings."
https://openalex.org/W3031845032,"Molecular therapies for cancers with targetable driver mutations and immunotherapies have revolutionized treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) during the last decade. International treatment guidelines began integrating targeted therapies in 2009 and immunotherapies in 2015. The aim of this study was to examine whether the benefits described for these new therapies in pivotal phase III trials have been translated to a real world patient population.Data from all consecutive patients diagnosed with stage IV NSCLC diagnosed at a community hospital in Switzerland between 2007 and 2018 were analyzed. Three groups of patients were compared, namely patients diagnosed before 2009 (group 1), between 2009 and 2015 (introduction of targeted therapies, group 2) and after 2015 (introduction of immunotherapies, group 3). The primary outcome was overall survival (OS). Time to treatment failure was a secondary outcome. Both endpoints were estimated using the Kaplan Meyer method and compared by log-rank test.408 patients were included. Patient characteristics were similar in the three groups. Median OS in groups 1, 2, and 3 was 9.8 (95% CI, 6.2 to 13.4), 9.9 (95% CI, 7.6 to 12.1) and 8.6 (95% CI, 6.6 to 10.5) months, respectively (p = 0.5). Across groups patients treated with targeted- and immunotherapies had a significantly better outcome than those treated with chemotherapy or best supportive care (p<0.001). Nevertheless, OS remained unchanged between groups despite adequate molecular testing and integration of targeted- and immunotherapies. Over time, the patient population got more morbid with respect to tumor burden (p = 0.02) and co-morbidities (p = 0.02).While selected subgroups of patients may benefit from new therapies, outcome in this unselected population of patients with stage IV NSCLC treated in daily practice has not improved over the last decade."
https://openalex.org/W3032043387,"Progressive increases in ethanol consumption is a hallmark of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Persistent changes in brain gene expression are hypothesized to underlie the altered neural signaling producing abusive consumption in AUD. To identify brain regional gene expression networks contributing to progressive ethanol consumption, we performed microarray and scale-free network analysis of expression responses in a C57BL/6J mouse model utilizing chronic intermittent ethanol by vapor chamber (CIE) in combination with limited access oral ethanol consumption. This model has previously been shown to produce long-lasting increased ethanol consumption, particularly when combining oral ethanol access with repeated cycles of intermittent vapor exposure. The interaction of CIE and oral consumption was studied by expression profiling and network analysis in medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, hippocampus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and central nucleus of the amygdala. Brain region expression networks were analyzed for ethanol-responsive gene expression, correlation with ethanol consumption and functional content using extensive bioinformatics studies. In all brain-regions studied the largest number of changes in gene expression were seen when comparing ethanol naïve mice to those exposed to CIE and drinking. In the prefrontal cortex, however, unique patterns of gene expression were seen compared to other brain-regions. Network analysis identified modules of co-expressed genes in all brain regions. The prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens showed the greatest number of modules with significant correlation to drinking behavior. Across brain-regions, however, many modules with strong correlations to drinking, both baseline intake and amount consumed after CIE, showed functional enrichment for synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W3032811039,"Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is characterized by elevated levels of acute phase proteins (APPs), but their association with tuberculous lymphadenitis (TBL) is poorly studied.We examined the systemic levels of APPs (alpha-2-macroglobulin [⍺-2MG], serum amyloid A [SAA], C-reactive protein [CRP] and haptoglobin [Hp]) in TBL, PTB, latent tuberculosis (LTB) and healthy controls (HC) at baseline and in TBL after the completion of anti-tuberculosis treatment (ATT). We have also examined the association of these proteins with lymph node (LN) size, culture grade and multiple versus single LN involvement.TBL individuals exhibited increased systemic levels of ⍺-2MG, SAA, CRP and Hp in comparison to HCs and increased CRP levels in comparison to LTB individuals. TBL individuals also exhibited decreased systemic levels of Hp compared to PTB individuals. APPs were not significantly associated with LN size, LN involvement and culture grade, indicating a lack of association with disease severity. Following ATT, post-treatment levels of ⍺-2MG, CRP and Hp were significantly diminished compared to pre-treatment levels.TBL disease is characterized by altered levels of APPs at baseline and modulated following treatment, indicating the presence of systemic inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W3029019776,"Mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV remains a challenge in resource-limited settings. Central to elimination of MTCT is effective Provider Initiated HIV Counseling and Testing (PICT). Research has shown that conducting PICT only at the initial antenatal care (ANC) visit fails to benefit pregnant women who seroconvert later in their pregnancy. This study aimed to determine the most cost effective time to perform repeat HIV testing during ANC and perinatal care (PNC).We studied the repeat HIV testing results of pregnant women ≥ 18 and adolescent girls aged 15-17 in the Sauri, Kenya Millennium Villages Project (MVP) site. Nurses provided HIV screening to 1,403 expectant women and 256 adolescent girls following the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th ANC visits, at birth and 6 and 14 weeks postpartum.Five women seroconverted during the study period (incidence proportion 0.41%). One woman seroconverted at the 2nd ANC visit, another one at the 3rd, two at the 4th and one at 6 weeks post-partum. Of all the women who seroconverted, four reported an HIV negative primary partner, while one reported an unknown partner status. None of the participants reported condom use during pregnancy. Two of the seroconverters vertically transmitted HIV to their babies. The results did not suggest a clear pattern of seroconversion during ANC and PNC.The low rates of seroconversion suggest that testing pregnant women multiple times during ANC and PNC may not be cost effective, but a follow-up test during birth may be protective of the newborn."
https://openalex.org/W3029421782,"Measurement of the reactive hyperemia index (RHI) using peripheral arterial tonometry (PAT) has shown benefits in the evaluation of vascular endothelial function and prediction of cardiovascular disease prognosis. Thus, it is important to examine the factors that promote the RHI. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of molecular hydrogen (H2) on reactive hyperemia-PAT of the small arteries of fingers in healthy people.To determine the efficacy of H2 for improving peripheral vascular endothelial function, water containing high H2 concentrations was administered to participants, and the Ln_RHI was measured in the finger vasculature. Sixty-eight volunteers were randomly divided into two groups: a placebo group (n = 34) that drank molecular nitrogen (N2)-containing water and a high H2 group (n = 34) that drank high H2 water (containing 7 ppm of H2: 3.5 mg H2 in 500-mL water). The Ln_RHI was measured before ingesting the placebo or high H2 water, 1 h and 24 h after the first ingestion, and 14 days after daily ingestion of high H2 water or the placebo. The mixed effects model for repeated measures was used in data analysis.The high H2 group had a significantly greater improvement in Ln_RHI than the placebo group. Ln_RHI improved by 22.2% (p<0.05) at 24 h after the first ingestion of high H2 water and by 25.4% (p<0.05) after the daily consumption of high H2 water for 2 weeks.Daily consumption of high H2 water improved the endothelial function of the arteries or arterioles assessed by the PAT test. The results suggest that the continuous consumption of high H2 water contributes to improved cardiovascular health."
https://openalex.org/W3029494787,"A single experiment required 40 younger and older adults to discriminate global shape as depicted by Glass patterns (concentric and radial organizations). Such patterns have been widely used for decades, because in order to successfully perceive the depicted shape, the visual system has to detect both locally oriented features (dipoles) and their alignments across extended regions of space. In the current study, we manipulated the number of constituent dipoles in the stimulus patterns (40 or 200), the noise-to-signal ratio (zero, 1.0, & 5.0), and the pattern size (6.0 & 25.0 degrees visual angle). The observers' shape discrimination accuracies (d' values) decreased markedly as the amount of noise increased, and there were smaller (but significant) effects of both overall pattern size and the number of stimulus dipoles. Interestingly, while there was a significant effect of age, it was relatively small: the overall d' values for older and younger adults were 2.07 and 2.34, respectively. Older adults therefore retain an effective ability to visually perceive global shape, even for sparsely-defined patterns embedded in noise."
https://openalex.org/W3030879192,"A considerable challenge in quantification of the antimalarial piperaquine in plasma is carryover of analyte signal between assays. Current intensive pharmacokinetic studies often rely on the merging of venous and capillary sampling. Drug levels in capillary plasma may be different from those in venous plasma, Thus, correlation between capillary and venous drug levels needs to be established.Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used to develop the method. Piperaquine was measured in 205 pairs of capillary and venous plasma samples collected simultaneously at ≥24hr post dose in children, pregnant women and non-pregnant women receiving dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine as malaria chemoprevention. Standard three-dose regimen over three days applied to all participants with three 40mg dihydroartemisinin/320mg PQ tablets per dose for adults and weight-based dose for children. Correlation analysis was performed using the program Stata® SE12.1. Linear regression models were built using concentrations or logarithm transformed concentrations and the final models were selected based on maximal coefficient of determination (R2) and visual check.An LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated, utilizing methanol as a protein precipitation agent, a Gemini C18 column (50x2.0mm, 5μm) eluted with basic mobile phase solvents (ammonium hydroxide as the additive), and ESI+ as the ion source. This method had a calibration range of 10-1000 ng/mL and carryover was negligible. Correlation analysis revealed a linear relationship: Ccap = 1.04×Cven+4.20 (R2 = 0.832) without transformation of data, and lnCcap = 1.01×lnCven+0.0125, (R2 = 0.945) with natural logarithm transformation. The mean ratio (±SD) of Ccap/Cven was 1.13±0.42, and median (IQR) was 1.08 (0.917, 1.33).Capillary and venous plasma PQ measures are nearly identical overall, but not readily exchangeable due to large variation. Further correlation study accounting for disposition phases may be necessary."

A multiplex PCR approach was derived that facilitated the recovery of paired heavy and light chain immunoglobulin sequences from single sorted ferret B cells, allowing validation of predicted germline gene sequences and the identification of putative novel germlines. Eukaryotic expression vectors were developed that enabled the generation of recombinant ferret monoclonal antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W3029285465,"Gaming disorder, which is characterized by multiple cognitive and behavioral symptoms, often has comorbid psychiatric conditions such as depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. Neurobiological effects of the comorbid disorders so far reported are not converging, exhibiting positive and negative alterations of the connectivity in brain networks. In this study, we conducted resting-state functional magnetic-resonance imaging and whole brain functional connectivity analyses for young participants consisting of 40 patients diagnosed with the gaming disorder, with and without comorbid conditions, and 29 healthy controls. Compared to healthy controls, the gaming disorder-alone patients had partially diminished connectivities in the reward system and executive control network, within which there existed central nodes that served as a hub of diminished connections. In the gaming disorder patients who had comorbidity of autism spectrum disorder, the diminished connections were enlarged, with alteration of the hub nodes, to the entire brain areas involved in the reward system including cortical, subcortical and limbic areas that are crucial for reward processing, and to the whole cortical areas composing the executive control network. These observations suggest that the neurodevelopmental condition coexisting with the gaming disorder induced substantial impairment of the neural organizations associated with executive/cognitive and emotional functions, which are plausibly causal to the behavioral addiction, by rearranging and diminishing functional connectivities in the network."
https://openalex.org/W3031595488,"The selection of the anesthetic regime is a crucial component in many experimental animal studies. In rodent models of liver disease, the combination of ketamine and diazepam (KD), generally by the intramuscular (i.m.) route, has traditionally been the anesthesia of choice for the evaluation of systemic and hepatic hemodynamics but it presents several problems. Here, we compared the performance of inhalational sevoflurane (Sevo) against the KD combination as the anesthesia used for hemodynamic studies involving the measurement of portal pressure in normal rats (Ctrl) and rats with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension induced by partial portal vein ligation (PPVL). Compared with Ctrl rats, rats with PPVL presented characteristic alterations that were not influenced by the anesthetic regime, which included liver atrophy, splenomegaly, increased plasma fibrinogen, decreased alkaline phosphatase and glycemia, and frequent ascites. The use of the KD combination presented several disadvantages compared with the inhalational anesthesia with sevoflurane, including considerable mortality, a higher need of dose adjustments to maintain an optimal depth of anesthesia, increases of heart rate, and alteration of blood biochemical parameters such as the concentration of aspartate aminotransferase, lactate, and lactic dehydrogenase. Rats anesthetized with sevoflurane, on the other hand, presented lower respiratory rates. Importantly, the anesthetic regime did not influence the measurement of portal pressure either in Ctrl or PPVL rats, with the increase of portal pressure being similar in Sevo- and KD- anesthetized groups of PPVL rats compared with their respective control groups. Overall, our results suggest that anesthesia with sevoflurane is preferable to the combination of KD for performing systemic and hepatic hemodynamic studies in rats with non-cirrhotic portal hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W3029138219,"The aim of our study was to quantitatively evaluate the optical properties of photochromic lenses available on the market under cold and warm temperatures corresponding to the winter and summer seasons. The transmittance of 12 photochromic lenses from five manufacturers was measured using an UV/VIS spectrophotometer at cold (6 ± 2°C) and at warm (21 ± 2°C) temperatures. Transmittances were recorded from 380 to 780 nm and at the wavelength with maximum absorbance, which was calculated from the transmittance. The characteristics of the lenses were evaluated by examining changes in the optical properties at colorless and colored states and in the fading rate depending on temperature. The wavelength with maximum absorbance for photochromic lenses at the cold temperature showed a shorter shift than that at the warm temperature. The photochromic properties at the cold temperature were 11.5% lower for transmittance, 1.4 times higher for the change in optical density, and 1.2 times higher for the change in transmittance in the colored and colorless states, optical blocking % ratio, and change in luminous transmittance as compared to those at the warm temperature in the colored state. The fading rates based on the half-life time at the cold temperature were from 2.7 to 5.4 times lower than those at the warm temperature. The fading time until 80% transmittance was 6.4 times longer at the cold as compared to that at the warm temperature. There were significant differences in the optical properties of the photochromic lenses in terms of an absorbance at a shorter wavelength, a lower transmittance, a higher optical density, optical blocking % ratio, and luminous transmittance at the cold as compared to the warm temperature. Hence, it is necessary to provide consumers with information on photochromic optical properties, including the transmittance in colored and colorless states, and the fading rates at temperatures corresponding to the summer and winter seasons for each product."
https://openalex.org/W3029387118,"Understanding the effects of obesity on the immune profile of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients is critical, given the rising use of immunotherapies to treat advanced disease and recent reports of differential cancer immunotherapy outcomes with obesity. Here, we evaluated multiple immune parameters at the genetic, soluble protein, and cellular levels in peripheral blood and renal tumors from treatment-naive clear cell RCC (ccRCC) subjects (n = 69), to better understand the effects of host obesity (Body Mass Index ≥ 30 kg/m2) in the absence of immunotherapy. Tumor-free donors (n = 38) with or without obesity were used as controls. In our ccRCC cohort, increasing BMI was associated with decreased percentages of circulating activated PD-1+CD8+ T cells, CD14+CD16neg classical monocytes, and Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs). Only CD14+CD16neg classical monocytes and Tregs were reduced when obesity was examined as a categorical variable. Obesity did not alter the percentages of circulating IFNγ+ CD8 T cells or IFNγ+, IL-4+, or IL-17A+ CD4 T cells in ccRCC subjects. Of 38 plasma proteins analyzed, six (CCL3, IL-1β, IL-1RA, IL-10, IL-17, and TNFα) were upregulated specifically in ccRCC subjects with obesity versus tumor-free controls with obesity. IGFBP-1 was uniquely decreased in ccRCC subjects with obesity versus non-obese ccRCC subjects. Immunogenetic profiling of ccRCC tumors revealed that 93% of examined genes were equivalently expressed and no changes in cell type scores were found in stage-matched tumors from obesity category II/III versus normal weight (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 versus 18.5-24.9 kg/m2, respectively) subjects. Intratumoral PLGF and VEGF-A proteins were elevated in ccRCC subjects with obesity. Thus, in ccRCC patients with localized disease, obesity is not associated with widespread detrimental alterations in systemic or intratumoral immune profiles. The effects of combined obesity and immunotherapy administration on immune parameters remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W3029513664,"This paper describes the role of ambient pressure in self-heating torrefaction of livestock manure. We explored the initiating temperatures required to cause self-heating of wet dairy cattle manure at different ambient pressures (0.1, 0.4, 0.7, and 1.0 MPa). Then, we conducted proximate, elemental, and calorific analyses of biochar torrefied at 210, 250, and 290°C. The results showed that self-heating was induced at 155°C or higher for 0.1 MPa and at 115°C or lower for 0.4 MPa or higher. The decrease of the initiating temperature at elevated pressure was due not only to more oxygen, but also to the retention of moisture that can promote chemical oxidation of manure. Biochar yields decreased with increasing torrefaction temperature and pressure, and the yield difference at 0.1 and 1.0 MPa was more substantial at lower temperatures: a 29.8, 16.4, and 9.4% difference at 210, 250, and 290°C, respectively. Proximate and elemental analyses showed that elevated pressure promotes devolatilization, deoxygenation, and coalification compared to atmospheric pressure; its impact, however, was less at higher temperatures as the torrefaction temperature became more dominant. Calorific analysis revealed that elevated pressure can increase the higher heating value (HHV) on a dry and ash-free basis at 210°C because of the increase in carbon content, but its impact is limited at 250 and 290°C. Meanwhile, the HHV on a dry basis exhibited the opposite trend due primarily to an enlargement of ash content. The present study revealed that ambient pressure considerably affects the initiating temperature of self-heating and the chemical properties of biochar at a low torrefaction temperature."
https://openalex.org/W3031079945,"Alpha-toxin (Hla) is a major virulence factor of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and plays an important role in S. aureus-induced pneumonia. It binds as a monomer to the cell surface of eukaryotic host cells and forms heptameric transmembrane pores. Sensitivities toward the toxin of various types of potential host cells have been shown to vary substantially, and the reasons for these differences are unclear. We used three human model airway epithelial cell lines (16HBE14o-, S9, A549) to correlate cell sensitivity (measured as rate of paracellular gap formation in the cell layers) with Hla monomer binding, presence of the potential Hla receptors ADAM10 or α5β1 integrin, presence of the toxin-stabilizing factor caveolin-1 as well as plasma membrane lipid composition (phosphatidylserine/choline, sphingomyelin). The abundance of ADAM10 correlated best with gap formation or cell sensitivities, respectively, when the three cell types were compared. Caveolin-1 or α5β1 integrin did not correlate with toxin sensitivity. The relative abundance of sphingomyelin in plasma membranes may also be used as a proxi for cellular sensitivity against alpha-toxin as sphingomyelin abundances correlated well with the intensities of alpha-toxin mediated gap formation in the cell layers."
https://openalex.org/W3028903425,"Introduction The liver is well known for its enormous regenerative capacity. If the hepatocytes are compromised the reserve stem cells can regrow the lost tissue by means of oval cells differentiating into hepatocytes. We were curious whether this standby system was able to compensate for ontogenic liver growth arrested by 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) treatment or if it can be influenced by cholic acid, known to promote liver growth in several reactions. Methods (i) Four weeks-old (60-70g) male F344 rats were kept on standard chow and treated with solvent only, (ii) others were kept on 0,2% cholic acid (CA) enriched diet, (iii) treated with AAF, or (iiii) given a combination of CA diet and AAF treatment (AAF/CA). The proliferative response of epithelial cells was characterized by pulse bromodeoxyuridine labelling. The relative gene expression levels of senescence-related factors and bile acid receptors were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Results AAF administration efficiently inhibited the physiological proliferation of hepatocytes in young, male F344 rats after weaning. The activation of stem cells was indicated by the increased proliferation of periportal biliary/oval cells (B/OC). If the rats were fed additionally by cholic acid enriched diet, typical oval cell reaction emerged, subsequently the oval cells differentiated into hepatocytes restituting liver growth. This reaction was mediated by increased production of HGF, IL-6 and SCF by the damaged liver. Moreover, upregulation of FXR expression on B/OC made them competent for bile acids. Our results indicate that endogenous, autocrine mechanisms involved in liver ontogeny are also able to activate the backup regenerative machinery of stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W3029408070,"Purpose We developed an ex vivo lung CT (EVL-CT) technique that allows us to obtain detailed CT images and morphologically assess the retrieved lung from a donor for transplantation. After we recovered the lung graft from a brain-dead donor, we transported it to our hospital and CT images were obtained ex vivo before lung transplant surgery. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between the EVL-CT findings and post-transplant outcome in patients who underwent bilateral lung transplantation (BLT) or single lung transplantation (SLT). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the records of 70 patients with available EVL-CT data who underwent BLT (34 cases) or SLT (36 cases) in our hospital between October 2007 and September 2017. The recipients were divided into 2 groups (control group, infiltration group) according to the findings of EVL-CT of the lung graft in BLT and SLT, respectively. Recipients in the control group were transplanted lung grafts without any infiltrates (BLT control group, SLT control group). Recipients in the infiltration group received lung grafts with infiltrates (BLT infiltration group, SLT infiltration group). Results The recipients in the BLT infiltration group showed significantly slower recovery from primary graft dysfunction and a longer mechanical ventilation period and ICU stay period than those in the BLT control group. The mechanical ventilation period was significantly longer in the recipients in the SLT infiltration group than those in the SLT control group. Conclusion EVL-CT may predict the outcome of the early phase after lung transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W3031118934,"Metastases are the most prevalent tumors in the brain and are commonly associated with high morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have suggested that brain tumors can induce a loss of functional connectivity and alter the brain network architecture. Little is known about the effect of brain metastases on whole-brain functional and structural connectivity networks. In this study, 14 patients with brain metastases and 16 healthy controls underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). We constructed functional connectivity network using rs-fMRI signal correlations and structural connectivity network using DTI tractography. Graph theoretical analysis was employed to calculate network properties. We further evaluated the performance of brain networks after metastases resection by a simulated method. Compared to healthy controls, patients with brain metastases showed an altered ""small-world"" architecture in both functional and structural connectivity networks, shifting to a more randomness organization. Besides, the coupling strength of functional-structural connectivity was decreased in patients. After removing nodes infiltrated by metastases, aggravated disruptions were found in both functional and structural connectivity networks, and the alterations of network properties correlated with the removed hubs number. Our findings suggest that brain metastases interfere with the optimal network organization and relationship of functional and structural connectivity networks, and tumor resection involving hubs could cause a worse performance of brain networks. This study provides neuroimaging guidance for neurosurgical planning and postoperative assessment of brain metastases from the aspect of brain networks."
https://openalex.org/W3031254603,"Paltering is a form of deception whereby true statements are used to mislead and is widely employed in negotiations, marketing, espionage, and ordinary communications where speakers hold ulterior motives. We argue that paltering is accomplished through strategic violations of communicative norms such as the Gricean cooperative principles of relevance, quantity, quality and manner. We further argue that, just as genuine paltering deceives by deliberately violating communicative norms, inadvertent violations of these norms may be just as misleading. In this work, we demonstrated that educational information presented prominently on the American Diabetes Association website violated the Gricean communicative principles and disrupted readers’ performance on a test of diabetes knowledge. To establish the effects of these communicative violations, we revised the ADA's information to preserve the original content while better adhering to pragmatic principles. When these ADA explanations were judiciously revised to minimize pragmatic violations, they were transformed from misleading to educational."
https://openalex.org/W3031805759,"Background Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is the treatment option for patients with severe osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee whose symptoms are refractory to conservative management. Unfortunately, the level of patient dissatisfaction is high, reaching up to 25%. The reasons for this dissatisfaction are multifactorial, but bone-implant mismatch significantly increases the chance of pain and functional limitation. Sex-specific prosthesis designs have been developed to overcome this issue, but their use is still controversial. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate possible sex differences in the shape of the distal femur in patients with osteoarthritis. Secondary objectives were to investigate interpersonal variability of the distal femur and to determine the number of femoral implant sizes required to meet shape variations. Methods and findings A cross-sectional observational study prospectively compared 294 knees of 293 patients with osteoarthritis according to sex (201 female/93 male). Six intraoperative measurements were performed on the distal femur (height and width of both lateral and medial condyles, total medial-lateral width of the femur, and intercondylar distance). Sex differences and interpersonal variability were analyzed by multiple linear regressions. Measurements were also correlated with patient height. An optimization analysis was used to estimate the number of femoral implant sizes required. There were significant sex differences in the distal femur, where men had higher values than women in all measurements. Great interpersonal variability was found. The height of the lateral condyle was correlated with patient height, but the correlation was not strong. Twenty-five femoral implant sizes were required to meet the shape variations in our sample. Conclusions The shape of the distal femur in patients with osteoarthritis shows great interpersonal variability, with men showing significantly higher values than women. A total of 25 different implant sizes would be necessary to adequately meet the variations observed in our study population."
https://openalex.org/W3028668676,"Background Eswatini (formerly Swaziland) has one of the highest rates of TB and HIV co-disease in the world. Despite national efforts to improve service delivery and prevent TB and HIV transmission, rates remain high. A recent prospective, observational study of integrated, patient-selected IPT delivery showed extraordinary improvements in IPT adherence, running counter to previous assumptions. This prompted the need to understand contextual and unseen study factors that contributed to high rates of adherence. Objective To investigate high rates of IPT adherence rates among people living with HIV who participated in an observational study comparing modes of IPT delivery. Methods Community-based participatory research guided the development of in-person administration of semi-structured questionnaires. Observational and field note data were analyzed. Qualitative data were analyzed using content analysis. Results We interviewed 150 participants and analyzed responses from the 136 who remembered being given a choice of their IPT delivery method. Fifty-seven percent were female and the median age was 42. Nearly 67% of participants chose to receive facility-based IPT. High rates of self-reported IPT treatment adherence were linked to four key concepts: 1) adherence was positively impacted by community education; 2) disclosure of status served to empower participant completion; 3) mode of delivery perceptions positively impacted adherence; and 4) choice of treatment delivery seen as helpful but not essential for treatment completion. Discussion Achieving higher rates of IPT adherence in Eswatini and similar rural areas requires community-engaged education and outreach in coordination with care delivery systems."
https://openalex.org/W3031621912,"Many blood donation services around the globe maintain large archives of serum and/or plasma specimens of blood donations which could potentially be used for serologic surveillance and risk assessment of influenza. Harnessing this potential requires robust evidence that the outcomes of influenza serology in plasma, which is rarely used, is consistent with that in serum, which is the conventional choice of specimens for influenza serology. We harvested EDTA-plasma specimens from the blood donation archives of Hong Kong Red Cross Transfusion Services, where EDTA is the type of anticoagulant used for plasma collection, compared their antibody titers and responses to that in serum. Influenza A/H1N1/California/7/2009 and A/H3N2/Victoria/208/2009 were the test strains. Our results showed that antibody titers in 609 matched serum/EDTA-plasma specimens (i.e. obtained from the same donor at the same time) had good agreement inferred by Intraclass Correlation Coefficient, the value of which was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.77-0.86) for hemagglutination inhibition assay and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.96) for microneutralization assay; seroconversion rates (based on hemagglutination inhibition titers) during the 2010 and 2011 influenza seasons in Hong Kong inferred from paired EDTA-plasma were similar to that inferred from paired sera. Our study provided the proof-of-concept that blood donation archives could be leveraged as a valuable source of longitudinal blood specimens for the surveillance, control and risk assessment of both pandemic and seasonal influenza."
https://openalex.org/W3032618910,"Cortical neurons fire intermittently and synchronously during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREMS), in which active and silent periods are referred to as ON and OFF periods, respectively. Neuronal firing rates during ON periods (NREMS-ON-activity) are similar to those of wakefulness (W-activity), raising the possibility that NREMS-ON neuronal-activity is fragmented W-activity. To test this, we investigated the patterning and organization of cortical spike trains and of spike ensembles in neuronal networks using extracellular recordings in mice. Firing rates of neurons during NREMS-ON and W were similar, but showed enhanced bursting in NREMS with no apparent preference in occurrence, relative to the beginning or end of the on-state. Additionally, there was an overall increase in the randomness of occurrence of sequences comprised of multi-neuron ensembles in NREMS recorded from tetrodes. In association with increased burst firing, somatic calcium transients were increased in NREMS. The increased calcium transients associated with bursting during NREM may activate calcium-dependent, cell-signaling pathways for sleep related cellular processes."
https://openalex.org/W3028698724,"Efavirenz-based first-line regimens have been widely used for children ≥3 years of age starting antiretroviral therapy, despite possible resistance with prior exposure to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT). We used logistic regression to examine the association between PMTCT exposure and viral failure (VF) defined as two consecutive viral loads (VL)>1000 copies/ml between 6–18 months on ART. Children with previous nevirapine exposure for PMTCT were not at higher risk of VF compared to unexposed children (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR): 0.79; 95% CI:0.56, 1.11)."
https://openalex.org/W3031402526,"Studies on natural and social vision often need to quantify subjective intensity along a particular dimension for a large number of stimuli whose perceptual ordering is unknown. Here, we introduce an easy experimental protocol of comparative judgments that can rank and scale subjective stimulus intensity using a comparatively small number of trials. On each trial in our protocol, the observer initially views M stimuli sampled from a space of N stimuli and selects the stimulus that elicits maximum subjective response along a given dimension (e.g., the most attractive). The selected stimulus is subsequently discarded, the observer then performs a judgment on the remaining stimuli, and the process is iterated until the last stimulus remains and a new trial begins. The method relies on sorting perceived stimulus order in the N x N comparison matrix via logistic regression and sampling the next set of M stimuli such that responses will be collected only for stimulus pairs whose expected response ratio is most informative. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this method can estimate psychological scale with a small number of responses. Psychophysical experiments confirm that the method can quickly estimate the contrast response function for gratings and the perceived glossiness of naturalistic objects. This protocol would be useful for characterizing human judgments along various dimensions, especially those with no physical image correlates such as emotional and social attributes."
