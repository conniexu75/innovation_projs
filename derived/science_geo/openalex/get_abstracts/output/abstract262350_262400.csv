https://openalex.org/W2141560930,"Electronic transport in single or a few layers of graphene is the subject of intense interest at present. The specific band structure of graphene, with its unique valley structure and Dirac neutrality point separating hole states from electron states, has led to the observation of new electronic transport phenomena such as anomalously quantized Hall effects, absence of weak localization and the existence of a minimum conductivity. In addition to dissipative transport, supercurrent transport has also been observed. Graphene might also be a promising material for spintronics and related applications, such as the realization of spin qubits, owing to the low intrinsic spin orbit interaction, as well as the low hyperfine interaction of the electron spins with the carbon nuclei. Here we report the observation of spin transport, as well as Larmor spin precession, over micrometre-scale distances in single graphene layers. The 'non-local' spin valve geometry was used in these experiments, employing four-terminal contact geometries with ferromagnetic cobalt electrodes making contact with the graphene sheet through a thin oxide layer. We observe clear bipolar (changing from positive to negative sign) spin signals that reflect the magnetization direction of all four electrodes, indicating that spin coherence extends underneath all of the contacts. No significant changes in the spin signals occur between 4.2 K, 77 K and room temperature. We extract a spin relaxation length between 1.5 and 2 mum at room temperature, only weakly dependent on charge density. The spin polarization of the ferromagnetic contacts is calculated from the measurements to be around ten per cent."

Although the pathologic mechanisms linking obesity with these co-morbidities are most likely multifactorial, increasing evidence indicates that altered secretion of adipose-derived signaling molecules (adipokines; e.g. adiponectin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor α) and local inflammatory responses are contributing factors. Chemerin (RARRES2 or TIG2) is a recently discovered chemoattractant protein that serves as a ligand for the G protein-coupled receptor CMKLR1 (ChemR23 or DEZ) and has a role in adaptive and innate immunity. Here we show an unexpected, high level expression of chemerin and its cognate receptor CMKLR1 in mouse and human adipocytes. Cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes secrete chemerin protein, which triggers CMKLR1 signaling in adipocytes and other cell types and stimulates chemotaxis of CMKLR1-expressing cells. Adenoviral small hairpin RNA targeted knockdown of chemerin or CMKLR1 expression impairs differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes, reduces the expression of adipocyte genes involved in glucose and lipid homeostasis, and alters metabolic functions in mature adipocytes. We conclude that chemerin is a novel adipose-derived signaling molecule that regulates adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism.

We conclude that chemerin is a novel adipose-derived signaling molecule that regulates adipogenesis and adipocyte metabolism. White adipose tissue, in addition to serving an important metabolic role, is an active endocrine organ that secretes a number of signaling peptides with diverse biological functions (1Hutley L.

Chemerin is secreted as an 18-kDa inactive pro-protein and undergoes extracellular serine protease cleavage of the C-terminal portion of the protein to generate the 16-kDa active chemerin, which is present in plasma, serum, and hemofiltrate (26Meder W.

The estimated concentration of active chemerin in plasma and serum, respectively, was 3.0 and 4.4 nm in humans and 0.6 and 0.5 nm in mice (28Zabel B.A. Zuniga L. Ohyama T. Allen S.J. Cichy J.

Consistent with the properties of a proinflammatory secreted protein, active chemerin is abundant in ascites fluid from ovarian cancer patients (1.8-7 nm) and synovial fluid from arthritic patients (22 nm) (27Wittamer V. Franssen J.D. Vulcano M. Mirjolet J.F. Le Poul E. Migeotte I. Brezillon S. Tyldesley R. Blanpain C. Detheux M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Communi D. J. Exp.

Initial screening studies in our laboratory identified high expression of chemerin and CMKLR1 in white adipose tissue of mouse. These data suggested that white adipose tissue is a source and target for chemerin signaling. Based on our initial gene expression data, observations that chemerin is a secreted protein (24Nagpal S.

Metab. 2004; 89: 2548-2556Crossref PubMed Scopus (3679) Google Scholar, 33Diamond F. Growth Genet. Horm. 2002; 18: 17-22Google Scholar), we have proposed and tested the hypothesis that chemerin is an adipokine with a regulatory role in adipogenesis or adipocyte function. Animal Protocol and Housing—The Dalhousie University Committee on Laboratory Animals approved experimental procedures involving mice according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care. C57/BL/6J mice were bred in-house, in the Carleton Campus Animal Care Facility. Lepob/ob mice on a C57/BL/6J background and their littermate controls were obtained from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, MR). The mice were kept on a 12-h day/night cycle, were housed in cages lined with pine bedding, and had free access to water and Purina mouse chow. RNA Isolation and QPCR Analysis—Adult male mice were anesthetized with 50 mg kg-1 of sodium pentobarbital. Tissues were isolated and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For adipose tissue fractionation, freshly isolated epididymal (visceral) fat pads were placed in 5 ml of ice-cold DMEM with 1% BSA and 2 mg/ml of collagenase II and minced with scissors. The tissue was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C with intermittent pipetting, diluted into 10 ml of ice-cold DMEM and filtered through 70-μm nylon mesh, and centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 5 min to separate the adipocyte (buoyant) and stromal vascular fractions (pellet). Total RNA was isolated from each fraction using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Total RNA from tissues (5 μg) or cells (0.5 or 1.0 μg) was reverse-transcribed using Stratascript™ reverse transcriptase (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX), and 1 μl of the cDNA product was amplified by quantitative PCR using 125 nm gene-specific primers (supplemental Table 1) in a total volume of 20 μl with Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR master mix (Stratagene) using a Stratagene MX3000p thermocycler (34Goralski K.B. Acott P.D. Fraser A.D. Worth D. Sinal C.J. Drug Metab. Dispos. 2006; 34: 288-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Relative gene expression was normalized to ribosome polymerase II (rpII) or cyclophilin A (CycA) expression using the ΔΔCT method (35Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123392) Google Scholar). Mouse Adipocyte Cell Culture—3T3-L1 preadipocytes were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown according to standard protocols (36Lagace D.C. McLeod R.S. Nachtigal M.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Confluent preadipocytes were differentiated in adipocyte media (DMEM, 10% FBS, 850 nm insulin, and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin) supplemented with 250 nm dexamethasone and 100 μm isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) for 3 days. After this time, the cells were maintained in adipocyte media, which was changed every 2 days. All media were phenol red-free. Adipocyte-conditioned media used for Western blots, CMKLR1 activation, or the chemotaxis assay were obtained by replacing the regular adipocyte media with serum-free adipocyte media for a period of 24 h. For ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation studies, adipocyte media were replaced with fresh media 4 h prior to the assay. At the time of the assay fresh adipocyte media containing (0.2, 1.0, or 10 nm) chemerin were added to the cells. Between 2 and 30 min thereafter, media were removed, and 100 μl of 1× Laemmli buffer was added to stop the reaction and lyse the adipocytes. Oil Red O staining of adipocytes and quantification of extracted dye were carried out as described previously (36Lagace D.C. McLeod R.S. Nachtigal M.W. Endocrinology. 2004; 145: 5493-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—We generated polyclonal rabbit antibodies against a synthetic peptide region of mouse chemerin (supplemental Fig. 1). The immunizing peptide (CLAFQEIGVDRAEEV) corresponded to amino acids 47-60 of the predicted mouse chemerin protein and was conjugated through a non-native N-terminal cysteine (indicated as boldface C) to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) (Sigma Genosys). Rabbits were given a primary immunization by subcutaneous injection of 150 μg of the peptide-KLH conjugate in Freund's complete adjuvant. Subsequent immunizations with the peptide-KLH conjugate in Freund's incomplete adjuvant were administered 3, 5, and 7 weeks later. 10 days after the final immunization, the rabbits were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture. The specificity of the antiserum was confirmed by testing immunoreactivity against recombinant mouse chemerin (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and COS7 cells that were transiently transfected with a mchemerin-pFLAG-CMV-5a construct or the control vector pFLAG-CMV-5a (Stratagene) (supplemental Fig. 1). For Western blots, 100 μl of 24-h conditioned adipocyte media were added to 20 μl of 6× SDS loading buffer. Fifteen μl of the solution was separated on a 12.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred overnight to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were blocked (1 h) in 3% skim milk in pH 7.5 Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween (TBST) and then incubated with protein A-purified rabbit anti-chemerin antiserum (1:200) in 3% skim milk/TBST for 2 h at room temperature and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (1:25,000) for 1 h at room temperature in 3% skim milk/TBST. Immunoreactivity was detected by incubation with fluorescent ECL-plus™ reagent (GE Healthcare) and visualized directly with a Storm 840 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). A similar protocol using 1:200 dilutions of P-ERK (E-4) and ERK (D-2) antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used to detect extracellular-related kinase 2 (ERK2) and phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 in whole cell lysates from chemerin-treated adipocytes. Aequorin Assay—The aequorin assay is a cell-based, bioluminescence reporter gene assay used to detect CMKLR1 activation (27Wittamer V. Franssen J.D. Vulcano M. Mirjolet J.F. Le Poul E. Migeotte I. Brezillon S. Tyldesley R. Blanpain C. Detheux M. Mantovani A. Sozzani S. Vassart G. Parmentier M. Communi D. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 977-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). CMKLR1-CHO-K1 cells (Euroscreen, Belgium) express human CMKLR1, Gα16 (G protein), and an intracellular reporter gene (mitochondrial aequorin) that is activated by the Ca2+ influx produced when chemerin binds to CMKLR1 activating Gα16. The control CHO-K1 cells (Euroscreen, Belgium) express the Gα16 protein and mitochondrial aequorin only and do not respond to chemerin. Control CHO-K1 cells were maintained in complete Ham's F-12 with 10% FBS, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 250 μg/ml Zeocin. The media supplemented with the antibiotic G418 (400 μg/ml) were used for maintenance of the CHO-CMKLR1 cells. Cells in mid-log phase, grown in media without antibiotics for 20 h prior to the test, were detached with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA, centrifuged and suspended (5 × 106 cells/ml) in 0.1% BSA media (DMEM/Ham's F-12 with HEPES, without phenol red) plus 5 μm coelenterazine h (Sigma) and incubated for 4 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Cells were then diluted 1 in 10 with 0.1% BSA media and incubated for 1 h. For each measurement 50 μl of cell suspension (25,000 cells) was added into each well of the plate containing 50 μl of diluted conditioned media or recombinant chemerin. The emitted light was recorded for 20 s at 469 nm following the injection of cells. The intensity of emitted light was normalized to the response produced by the Ca2+ ionophore digitonin (50 μm). Cell Migration Assay—Conditioned serum-free media from preadipocytes and adipocytes were tested for the ability to stimulate migration of the murine pre-B lymphoma cell line L1.2 stably transfected with human CMKLR1 (L1.2-CMKLR1) or empty vector (L1.2-pcDNA3). The cells were maintained as described previously (30Zabel B.A. Silverio A.M. Butcher E.C. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). All assay incubations were performed under standard conditions (37 °C in 95% air, 5% CO2). The L1.2 cells were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and were treated with 5 mm n-butyric acid 24 h prior to experimentation. Purified mouse chemerin and conditioned (24 h) serum-free media samples from preadipocyte or 13-day mature adipocyte cell cultures was diluted 1:100 into the chemotaxis medium (600 μl final volume) consisting of phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium and 1% fetal bovine serum and was incubated for 30 min under standard conditions. Transwell inserts (5 μm pore size) containing 250,000 L1.2-CMKLR1 or L1.2-pcDNA cells in 100 μl of chemotaxis media were added to wells containing the media samples and incubated for 3 h. The inserts were removed, and cells that migrated into the lower chamber were labeled for 3 h with calcein-AM. The calcein-AM-labeled cells were diluted 1:10 in PBS and fluorimetrically measured (485 nm excitation and 520 nm emission) using a Carey spectrofluorometer. A standard curve was generated from calcein-AM labeling of known quantities of either cell type and was used to quantify the total number of cells (% input migration) that migrated toward the test samples. Immunohistochemistry—Preadipocytes were plated on collagen-coated glass coverslips and differentiated according to the standard protocol. On day 8, the cells were rinsed in PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were rinsed in PBS and incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 (3 min) followed by incubation in standard blocking solution (10% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h, 1:200 dilution of anti-human CMKLR1 monoclonal antibody (clone 84939, R&D Systems) for 2 h, 1:200 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG3 (Invitrogen) for 1 h, and counterstained with Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) 1 μg/ml in PBS for 5 min. Slides were washed in PBS and mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Images were captured on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope equipped with an AxioCam camera system (Zeiss Canada, Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Adenoviral Small Hairpin Loop RNA Interference (shRNA)—shRNA vectors were constructed using the Block-it™ adenoviral RNAi expression system (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single-stranded oligonucleotides (supplemental Table 1B) for shRNA were designed using Block-it™ RNAi designer (Invitrogen). Positive adenoviral clones, mchemerin-pAD-shRNA (CE-shRNA), mCMKLR1-pAD-shRNA (CR-shRNA), and LacZ-pAD-shRNA (LZ-shRNA) were amplified in the HEK-293A producer cell line. Viral copy number in crude lysates was determined by quantitative PCR amplification. A poly-l-lysine (Mr 30,000-70,000)-assisted procedure was used to transduce confluent preadipocytes or adipocytes (37Orlicky D.J. Schaack J. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 460-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crude adenoviral lysates (m.o.i. 100-1000) were added to poly-l-lysine (0.5 μg/ml) Opti-MEM mix and incubated for 100 min at room temperature. The m.o.i. refers to the ratio of viral copy/cell number. One-day post-confluent preadipocytes were washed once with PBS, and 500 μl of the transduction mixture was added to each well (12-well plate) and incubated under standard conditions for 2 h followed by addition of 1 ml of DMEM with 0.2% BSA and incubated overnight. The next day media were replaced with normal preadipocyte media for 6 h. At this time the normal adipocyte differentiation and maintenance protocol was followed. Using the same protocol, adipocytes at day 4 post-differentiation were transduced with the crude adenoviral lysates. For the lipolysis assays, day 7 adipocytes were switched to DMEM + 0.1% BSA with or without 0.2 or 1.0 nm chemerin. 24 h later, media were replaced with DMEM + 0.1% BSA with or without 2 μm isoproterenol or 100 μm IBMX. Glycerol released into the media over a period of 2 or 4 h was measured using a lipolysis assay kit (ZenBio) according to the product instructions. Adiponectin Measurements—An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (adiponectin, Quantikine kit, R & D Systems) was used to measure adiponectin levels in 24-h conditioned serum-free media from adipocytes 5 or 8 days post-differentiation. Human Cells and RNA—Human preadipocytes and adipose tissue RNA were commercially available (ZenBio, Chapel Hill, NC). Human liver and placenta RNA were purchased from Stratagene. Superlots of cryopreserved human subcutaneous preadipocytes (ZenBio) contained preadipocytes pooled from six female donors aged 35-45 with an average body mass index of 29. The preadipocytes were seeded on 12-well plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. To induce differentiation, the preadipocytes were incubated with 1 ml of adipocyte differentiation media (ZenBio, Research Triangle Park, NC) for 7 days. Thereafter, adipocytes were maintained in DMEM/F-12 with 10% FBS, 850 nm insulin. Oil Red O staining and preparation of cells for RNA extraction were performed as described for the 3T3-L1 cells. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of 3-4 separate measurements unless otherwise stated in the figure legends. A one- or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for multiple comparison procedures. A Tukey's test was used for post hoc analysis of the significant ANOVA. A difference in mean values between groups was considered to be significant when p ≤ 0.05. Using quantitative real time PCR analysis, we determined that murine chemerin mRNA was most highly expressed in white adipose tissue, liver, and placenta with intermediate expression in the ovary (Fig. 1A). chemerin mRNA levels in other tissues were less than 5% of that in liver. Expression of CMKLR1 mRNA was highest in white adipose tissue, followed by intermediate levels in lung, heart and placenta (Fig. 1B). By comparison, CMKLR1 expression in other tissues was very low. The adipose organ consists of white and brown adipose, which is contained within various visceral and subcutaneous depots. The white adipose represents the vast majority of adipose tissue in the body and stores energy as triglyceride (38Cinti S. Prostaglandins Leukot. Essent. Fatty Acids. 2005; 73: 9-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Conversely, the brown adipose is specialized for energy dissipation through nonshivering thermogenesis (39Cannon B. Nedergaard J. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 277-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (4521) Google Scholar). We found that chemerin and CMKLR1 were expressed to a similar degree in epididymal, perirenal and mesenteric (visceral), and inguinal (subcutaneous) white adipose tissue depots (Fig. 1C). In comparison, brown adipose (intrascapular depot) only expressed low levels of chemerin and CMKLR1 and suggests a primary function for chemerin and CMKLR1 in energy-storing white adipose tissue opposed to thermogenic brown adipose tissue. Within epididymal white adipose tissue, chemerin and"

https://openalex.org/W2111307900,"Most invasive bacterial infections are caused by species that more commonly colonize the human host with minimal symptoms. Although phenotypic or genetic correlates underlying a bacterium's shift to enhanced virulence have been studied, the in vivo selection pressures governing such shifts are poorly understood. The globally disseminated M1T1 clone of group A Streptococcus (GAS) is linked with the rare but life-threatening syndromes of necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome. Mutations in the GAS control of virulence regulatory sensor kinase (covRS) operon are associated with severe invasive disease, abolishing expression of a broad-spectrum cysteine protease (SpeB) and allowing the recruitment and activation of host plasminogen on the bacterial surface. Here we describe how bacteriophage-encoded GAS DNase (Sda1), which facilitates the pathogen's escape from neutrophil extracellular traps, serves as a selective force for covRS mutation. The results provide a paradigm whereby natural selection exerted by the innate immune system generates hypervirulent bacterial variants with increased risk of systemic dissemination."

This process involves binding of ATR to the ATR-activating domain of TopBP1, which is located between BRCT domains VI and VII. TopBP1 displays increased binding to ATR-ATRIP in Xenopus egg extracts containing checkpoint-inducing DNA templates. We show that an N-terminal region of TopBP1 containing BRCT repeats I-II is essential for this checkpoint-stimulated binding of TopBP1 to ATR-ATRIP. The BRCT I-II region of TopBP1 also binds specifically to the Rad9-Hus1-Rad1 (9-1-1) complex in Xenopus egg extracts. This binding occurs via the C-terminal domain of Rad9 and depends upon phosphorylation of its Ser-373 residue. Egg extracts containing either a mutant of TopBP1 lacking the BRCT I-II repeats or a mutant of Rad9 with an alanine substitution at Ser-373 are defective in checkpoint regulation. Furthermore, an isolated C-terminal fragment from Rad9 is an effective inhibitor of checkpoint signaling in egg extracts. These findings suggest that interaction of the 9-1-1 complex with the BRCT I-II region of TopBP1 is necessary for binding of ATR-ATRIP to the ATR-activating domain of TopBP1 and the ensuing activation of ATR.

Eukaryotic cells possess checkpoint regulatory mechanisms that are essential for safeguarding of the genome (1Abraham R.T.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). ATM is involved mainly in the detection of double-stranded DNA breaks (4Shiloh Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2006; 31: 402-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). ATR has a discrete role in the detection of stalled DNA replication forks, but it also functions in double-stranded DNA breaks-triggered responses (1Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2177-2196Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar, 4Shiloh Y. Trends Biochem.

A critical function of ATR involves activation of the downstream checkpoint effector kinase Chk1. In turn, Chk1 prohibits cell cycle progression by phosphorylating downstream cell cycle control proteins such as Cdc25 and Wee1 as long as damaged or incompletely replicated DNA is present in the cell (6Perry J.A. Kornbluth S.

The ATR-dependent activation of Chk1 is an elaborate process that involves numerous additional factors (3Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar, 5Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1265-1268Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 7Garcia V. Furuya K. Carr A.M. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). ATR itself possesses a tightly bound and indispensable subunit called ATRIP (8Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Our laboratory has demonstrated that a protein known as TopBP1 functions as a direct activator of ATR-ATRIP (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Once ATR-ATRIP becomes activated by TopBP1, it requires the assistance of the mediator protein Claspin to carry out the final activating phosphorylations of Chk1 (10Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol.

A. 2004; 101: 6484-6489Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Other factors that are important in the pathway leading to the activation of Chk1 include checkpoint clamp loader and clamp complexes (3Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Ünsal-Kaçmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2534) Google Scholar). In particular, a clamp loader consisting of Rad17 and the four small replication factor C subunits catalyzes the deposition of a trimeric checkpoint clamp onto checkpoint-triggering locations in chromosomes. This clamp, which is composed of Rad9, Hus1, and Rad1, is commonly referred to as the 9-1-1 complex (14Parrilla-Castellar E.R. Arlander S.J. Karnitz L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). It is thought that this complex is loaded onto recessed DNA ends, which would be present at both stalled DNA replication forks and double-stranded DNA breaks that have undergone resection (15Majka J. Burgers P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2249-2254Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 16Bermudez V.P. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Cesare A.J. Maniwa Y. Griffith J.D. Hurwitz J.

We have been investigating how the action of TopBP1 as an ATR-activating protein might be regulated during checkpoint responses. Recently, our laboratory reported that TopBP1 displays increased binding to ATR-ATRIP in the presence of checkpoint-triggering DNA templates in Xenopus egg extracts (20Yoo H.Y. Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17501-17506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Here we show that this regulated binding involves an N-terminal domain of TopBP1 containing its first two BRCT repeats. This region was not previously known to be important for the checkpoint-regulatory function of TopBP1 (21Hashimoto Y. Tsujimura T. Sugino A. Takisawa H. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 993-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Yan S. Lindsay H.D. Michael W.M. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This segment does not bind directly to ATR-ATRIP, but does interact well with the 9-1-1 complex via the C-terminal region of the Rad9 protein. This interaction is necessary for normal activation of Chk1 in Xenopus egg extracts. Thus, interaction of Rad9 with an essential region of the ATR-activating protein TopBP1 is critical for the initiation of checkpoint signaling. Xenopus Egg Extracts—Extracts from Xenopus egg were prepared as described previously (23Lee J. Gold D.A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 5269-5282Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The DNA replication checkpoint was induced by addition of aphidicolin (50 μg/ml) to interphase egg extracts containing demembranated sperm nuclei (4000/μl) and cycloheximide (100 μg/ml). Alternatively, checkpoint responses were triggered by addition of 50 μg/ml (dA)70-(dT)70 to egg extracts supplemented with 3 μm tautomycin (10Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Methods for isolation of total nuclear and chromatin fractions are described previously (24Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 329-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Antibodies and Immunodepletion—Antibodies against Xchk1, Xhus1, Xmcm7, Claspin, phospho-Ser-864 of Claspin, Xatr, and XtopBP1 were previously described (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 10Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Antisera against Xrad9 and Xrad1 were kindly provided by Dr. Howard Lindsay (Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK). Anti-GST and anti-phospho-Ser-344 of Xchk1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and Cell Signaling Technology, respectively. Control IgG was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. For immunodepletion of the 9-1-1 complex, affinity-purified anti-Xhus1 antibodies (150 μg total) were bound to recombinant protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and incubated with egg extract (100 μl) in three successive rounds. XtopBP1 was immunodepleted by published methods (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Recombinant Proteins—DNA constructs encoding various deletion mutants of HF-XtopBP1 lacking the indicated residues (ΔI-II, 106–282; ΔIII, 360–428; ΔIV-V, 588–710; ΔVI, 760–1014; ΔAAD, 993–1196; and ΔVII-VIII, 1227–1485) were produced using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) with pFastBac-HF-XtopBP1 as template (20Yoo H.Y. Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17501-17506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). HF-XtopBP1 contains both hemagglutinin and His6 tags at the N-terminal end and a FLAG tag at the C-terminal end. In the case of XtopBP1 fragments containing the N-terminal region (Δ760–1485), C-terminal region (Δ1–757), and BRCT domains I-II (Δ360–1485) and III-VI (Δ2–312 and Δ1006–1485), sequences encoding the indicated amino acids were removed by PCR-based methods. All recombinant versions of XtopBP1 were designed to contain the region with its putative nuclear localization sequence (amino acids 1495–1500) and were observed to enter the nucleus normally (data not shown). The sequence encoding Xrad9 was subcloned into the pFastBac-HTb vector to generate the His6-Xrad9 construct. Serine 373 of Xrad9 was changed into alanine (Xrad9-S373A) with the QuikChange kit. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced with Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Expressed proteins were purified with nickel-agarose beads (10Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). For preparation of recombinant Xenopus 9-1-1 complex, baculoviruses encoding untagged Xhus1 and Xrad1 (kindly provided by Dr. Karlene Cimprich, Stanford University, CA) and His6-Xrad9 were used to coinfect Sf9 insect cells. The complexes were purified as described (26Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Sequences encoding various segments from the C-terminal region of Xrad9 were amplified by PCR and inserted into the pGEX-4T3 vector (GE Healthcare). Unless indicated otherwise, the construct containing residues 258–377 is referred to as GST-Xrad9C. GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 pLysS cells and purified with glutathione-agarose beads. For inhibition of the phosphorylation of Xchk1 in egg extracts, these peptides were added up to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. 35S-Labeled Xchk1 was synthesized in vitro with TnT reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Protein Binding Assays—HF-XtopBP1 proteins (2 μg) were incubated in 100 μl of interphase egg extract for 90 min and recovered with anti-FLAG antibody beads (Sigma). In some cases, anti-FLAG antibodies were bound to protein G magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech). For GST-Xrad9 fragments, proteins (5 μg each) were incubated in 100 μl of interphase egg extract for 90 min and recovered with glutathione beads as described previously (10Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Treatments with λ protein phosphatase (20 units/μl; New England Biolabs) were carried out on GST-Xrad9C bound to glutathione-agarose beads for 30 min at room temperature in the buffer provided by the manufacturer. Phosphopeptide Mapping—Wild-type and S373A GST-Xrad9C were incubated in egg extracts supplemented with [γ-32P]ATP for 90 min and purified as described above. Labeled proteins were excised from SDS gels and digested with trypsin. Phosphopeptide mapping was carried out as before (27Lee J. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 551-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). XtopBP1 Associates with the C-terminal Domain of Xrad9 in Frog Egg Extracts—The C-terminal domain of Rad9 is important for checkpoint signaling in yeast and vertebrates (26Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 28Roos-Mattjus P. Hopkins K.M. Oestreich A.J. Vroman B.T. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1154-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To examine a potential functional relationship between this region of Rad9 and TopBP1 in Xenopus egg extracts, we prepared a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal 120 amino acids of Xenopus Rad9 (Xrad9) (residues 258–377). We incubated this fusion protein (hereafter referred to as GST-Xrad9C) in egg extracts, subsequently recovered the protein with glutathione-agarose beads, and performed immunoblotting with antibodies against Xenopus TopBP1 (XtopBP1). As shown in Fig. 1A, we could readily detect binding of endogenous XtopBP1 from egg extracts to exogenously added GST-Xrad9C. There was no binding of XtopBP1 to glutathione beads in extracts without added GST-Xrad9C. In these experiments, we observed a large upward mobility shift of GST-Xrad9C in SDS gels as a result of incubation in egg extracts. This shift appears to represent phosphorylation because it can be abolished by treatment with λ protein phosphatase. Furthermore, this phosphatase treatment caused dissociation of XtopBP1 that had originally bound to GST-Xrad9C in egg extracts. This observation suggests that the interaction between XtopBP1 and GST-Xrad9C depends upon phosphorylation. To examine which portion of Xrad9C is important for binding to XtopBP1, we prepared a variety of deletion mutants. As depicted in Fig. 1B, removal of up to 80 amino acids from the N-terminal end of the fragment did not affect binding significantly. However, removal of 20 additional residues (to yield the 358–377 fragment) did completely abrogate interaction with XtopBP1. Moreover, deletion of the last 20 amino acids from the opposite C-terminal end of the 258–377 fragment also eliminated binding to XtopBP1 (Fig. 1, C and D). Taken together, these results indicate that the last 20 amino acids of Xrad9 are necessary for binding of XtopBP1 in egg extracts, but that a somewhat larger fragment containing up to 40 C-terminal amino acids is sufficient. These findings are consistent with studies in human cells (31Greer D.A. Besley B.D. Kennedy K.B. Davey S. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 4829-4835PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of Rad9 is highly phosphorylated in yeast and vertebrates (28Roos-Mattjus P. Hopkins K.M. Oestreich A.J. Vroman B.T. Johnson K.L. Naylor S. Lieberman H.B. Karnitz L.M. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1154-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Within the last 20 amino acids of human Rad9, Ser-387 is constitutively phosphorylated during the cell cycle in tissue culture cells and is required for binding of TopBP1 (29St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D.

Phosphorylation of human Rad9 on Ser-387 does not require the presence of a checkpoint-inducing DNA lesion. This residue is highly conserved in vertebrates and corresponds to Ser-373 in Xrad9 (see Fig. 1C). In this region of fission yeast Rad9, both Thr-412 and Ser-423 undergo phosphorylation (30Furuya K. Poitelea M. Guo L. Caspari T. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1154-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Thr-412 has been implicated in the binding of Rad9 to Cut5 in fission yeast. To test whether phosphorylation of Ser-373 is necessary for binding of Xrad9 to XtopBP1 in egg extracts, we mutated this residue to alanine in the context of the GST-Xrad9C protein. The resulting S373A mutant had virtually no ability to interact with XtopBP1 (Fig. 1D). We verified by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping that Ser-373 of GST-Xrad9C (containing residues 258–377) undergoes phosphorylation in egg extracts (Fig. 1E). Role of Ser-373 from Xrad9 in Checkpoint Regulation—We proceeded to assess whether Ser-373 of Xrad9 is involved in checkpoint signaling in egg extracts. For this purpose, we immunodepleted the endogenous 9-1-1 complex from egg extracts with anti-Xhus1 antibodies and replaced it with recombinant 9-1-1 complexes containing either wild-type or S373A Xrad9 (Fig. 2, A and B). In parallel, we prepared mock-depleted extracts with control antibodies. We added aphidicolin and demembranated Xenopus sperm nuclei to the extracts to create chromatin with DNA replication blockages. Finally, we monitored activation of the DNA replication checkpoint by observing phosphorylation of 35S-Xchk1 in nuclear fractions from the extracts. As shown in Fig. 2C, removal of the 9-1-1 complex from egg extracts resulted in a significant reduction of the aphidicolin-induced phosphorylation of Xchk1, consistent with previous results (26Lupardus P.J. Cimprich K.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 32You Z. Kong L. Newport J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27088-27093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation could be restored by the addition of recombinant wild-type 9-1-1 complex, but not a mutant complex with the S373A Xrad9 subunit. Therefore, Ser-373 of Xrad9 appears to be functionally important for checkpoint signaling. Xrad9 Interacts with the BRCT I-II Region of XtopBP1—Next, we examined which portion of XtopBP1 was necessary for interaction with Xrad9. For this question, we prepared deletion mutants of recombinant, full-length XtopBP1 (HF-XtopBP1) lacking certain BRCT domains (see Fig. 3A). In particular, we removed regions that contained BRCT domains I-II, III, IV-V, VI, and VII-VIII. In addition, we prepared a deletion mutant of XtopBP1 that lacks its ATR-activating domain (AAD) (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). We incubated wild-type HF-XtopBP1 and the various deletion mutants in Xenopus egg extracts, recovered the proteins with anti-FLAG antibody beads, and then performed immunoblotting with anti-Xrad9 antibodies. Typically, all of the recombinant XtopBP1 proteins with the exception of the one lacking BRCT domains I-II could associate with endogenous Xrad9 in egg extracts (Fig. 3B). Likewise, we observed the same binding pattern for endogenous Xhus1, another component of the 9-1-1 complex. Interestingly, we could also detect binding of endogenous Xrad17 (the large subunit of the Xenopus Rad17-replication factor C clamp loader) to all of the constructs that bound the 9-1-1 components. In parallel, we also asked whether the isolated GST-Xrad9C fragment displayed similar binding properties. We observed that the C-terminal domain of Xrad9 could not associate with the ΔI-II mutant of XtopBP1, whereas it bound readily to wild-type, ΔAAD, and ΔIII versions of XtopBP1 under the same conditions (Fig. 3C). We also investigated, which regions of XtopBP1 were sufficient for binding of Xrad9. For these experiments, we used FLAG-tagged fragments of XtopBP1 containing approximately its N- and C-terminal halves. In addition, we prepared smaller recombinant fragments containing BRCT domains I-II or III-VI. Consistent with the results described above, the N-terminal domain of XtopBP1 bound well to endogenous Xrad9 and Xhus1, whereas there was no binding of the C-terminal domain (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, a fragment of XtopBP1 containing BRCT domains I-II, but not one comprised of domains III-VI, could associate with endogenous Xrad9 and Xhus1 from egg extracts. Finally, in reciprocal binding experiments, we found that GST-Xrad9C could pull down both the N-terminal half of XtopBP1 and the BRCT I-II fragment, but not the C-terminal half of the protein or the BRCT III-VI fragment (Fig. 3E). Taken together, these results indicate that the BRCT I-II region of XtopBP1 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to the C-terminal domain of Xrad9. The BRCT I-II Domain of XtopBP1 Is Essential for Checkpoint Signaling in Egg Extracts—We turned to the issue of whether the BRCT I-II domain of XtopBP1 is required for checkpoint signaling. To address this question, we immunodepleted endogenous XtopBP1 from egg extracts with anti-XtopBP1 antibodies and replaced it with either wild-type, ΔAAD, or ΔI-II versions of HF-XtopBP1 (Fig. 4A). Next, we added sperm chromatin and aphidicolin to the extracts and then examined phosphorylation of Xchk1 in nuclear fractions (Fig. 4B). As expected, there was no phosphorylation of Xchk1 in XtopBP1-depleted extracts (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 21Hashimoto Y. Tsujimura T. Sugino A. Takisawa H.

Chem. 2003; 278: 45507-45511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, we could restore this phosphorylation by adding back wild-type full-length HF-XtopBP1 (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 21Hashimoto Y. Tsujimura T. Sugino A. Takisawa H.

However, we could not rescue this defect with ΔAAD mutant of HF-XtopBP1, which reflected the fact that the AAD was required for the activation of ATR. Significantly, we found that the ΔI-II mutant was also unable to support phosphorylation of Xchk1 even though it contained an intact AAD. This observation suggests that the BRCT I-II region somehow regulates the function of the AAD. To corroborate this finding further, we used the model DNA template (dA)70-(dT)70. This double-stranded template, which induces a strong XtopBP1-dependent activation of Xatr, elicits a robust phosphorylation of Xchk1 (10Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 839-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 12Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). By contrast, a single-stranded template such as (dA)70 does not induce activation of Xatr. The activation of Xchk1 in the presence of (dA)70-(dT)70 does not require any DNA replication in egg extracts. We prepared XtopBP1-depleted extracts, supplemented them with either wild-type or ΔI-II XtopBP1, and finally added either (dA)70 or (dA)70-(dT)70.As shown in Fig. 4C, the extract containing wild-type XtopBP1 displayed robust phosphorylation of Xchk1 in the presence of (dA)70-(dT)70 but not (dA)70. By contrast, addition of (dA)70-(dT)70 did not induce phosphorylation of Xchk1 in the extract containing the ΔI-II mutant of XtopBP1. Taken together, these results indicate that BRCT I-II region of XtopBP1 is essential for the Xatr-dependent activation of Xchk1 in response to a number of different checkpoint-inducing DNA templates. The BRCT I-II Region Regulates Association of XtopBP1 with Xatr-Xatrip—To investigate the mechanism by which the BRCT I-II region of XtopBP1 participates in checkpoint regulation, we explored the Xatr-binding properties of the ΔI-II mutant. Our laboratory recently reported that Xatr-Xatrip displays increased binding to XtopBP1 upon addition of the checkpoint-inducing DNA template (dA)70-(dT)70 to egg extracts (20Yoo H.Y. Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17501-17506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To investigate what regions of XtopBP1 contribute to this regulation, we incubated wild-type or ΔI-II versions of HF-XtopBP1 in egg extracts containing either (dA)70 or (dA)70-(dT)70 (Fig. 5A). There was basal binding of wild-type HF-XtopBP1 to Xatr in the presence of (dA)70. This binding increased in extracts containing (dA)70-(dT)70. However, we observed that the ΔI-II mutant of XtopBP1 did not bind detectably to Xatr in extracts containing either (dA)70 or (dA)70-(dT)70. To investigate the generality of these findings, we also used extracts containing aphidicolin-induced DNA replication blocks in chromatin. As depicted in Fig. 5B, we could likewise observe good binding of HF-XtopBP1 to Xatr in nuclei from aphidicolin-treated extracts. However, there was only very weak binding of the ΔI-II mutant of XtopBP1 to Xatr under the same conditions. Taken together, these results indicate that the checkpoint-induced binding of XtopBP1 to Xatr depends upon the BRCT I-II region of XtopBP1. This observation is intriguing because we showed previously that the AAD of XtopBP1 associates with Xatr-Xatrip (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have been unable to observe binding of Xatr-Xatrip to the isolated BRCT I-II domain of XtopBP1 (data not shown). The implication is that the BRCT I-II region regulates the ability of a distinct region in the protein (namely, the AAD) to associate with Xatr-Xatrip. The Isolated C-terminal Domain of Xrad9 Acts as a Dominant-negative Inhibitor of Checkpoint Signaling in Egg Extracts—As another means to assess the importance of the interaction between Xrad9 and XtopBP1, we examined whether the GST-Xrad9C fragment could act as an inhibitor of checkpoint signaling in the egg extract system. For this purpose, we added either wild-type or S373A versions of GST-Xrad9C to aphidicolin-treated extracts and subsequently examined phosphorylation of Xchk1. In these experiments, we monitored phosphorylation of Xchk1 by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for phosphorylated Ser-344 of Xchk1 (34Guo Z. Kumagai A. Wang S.X. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 35Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. DeMayo F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Significantly, the wild-type version of GST-Xrad9C caused a marked reduction in the phosphorylation of Xchk1 on Ser-344 (Fig. 6A). In addition, this fragment also caused a large decrease in the phosphorylation of Claspin on Ser-864, a checkpoint-regulated phosphorylation that is necessary for binding of Claspin to Xchk1 (36Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). By contrast, the S373A mutant of GST-Xrad9C had little, if any, effect on the phosphorylation of either Xchk1 or Claspin. The GST-Xrad9C fragment had no effect on chromosomal DNA replication in egg extracts (data not shown). To corroborate these findings further, we used the model DNA template (dA)70-(dT)70 to induce a checkpoint response. Consistent with the results described above, wild-type but not S373A GST-Xrad9C also abolished the phosphorylation of Xchk1 in response to (dA)70-(dT)70 (Fig. 6B). To explore how GST-Xrad9C interferes with phosphorylation of Xchk1, we analyzed whether this fragment might affect binding of checkpoint proteins to chromatin. We observed that the wild-type GST-Xrad9C fragment caused a significant reduction in the binding of endogenous XtopBP1 to aphidicolin-treated chromatin (Fig. 6C). Conversely, the S373A mutant of GST-Xrad9C had no effect on the chromatin-binding properties of XtopBP1. On the other hand, neither the wild-type nor S373A forms of GST-Xrad9C appeared to have an effect on interaction of Xatr with aphidicolin-treated chromatin. These findings suggest that GST-Xrad9C perturbs the interaction of XtopBP1 with Xatr-Xatrip at stalled replication forks. In this report, we have explored how the ability of TopBP1 to activate ATR is regulated during checkpoint responses. The binding of XtopBP1 to the Xatr-Xatrip complex in Xenopus egg extracts increases in the presence of a checkpoint-triggering DNA template (20Yoo H.Y. Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17501-17506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have found that an N-terminal region of XtopBP1 encompassing BRCT repeats I-II is critical for this regulated binding. This segment of XtopBP1 does not associate directly with Xatr-Xatrip. Instead, this region is necessary for Xatr-Xatrip to dock with the AAD of XtopBP1, which is situated near the other end of the protein between BRCT domains VI and VII. This process is essential for checkpoint signaling because egg extracts containing a mutant of XtopBP1 lacking the BRCT I-II region are completely defective in carrying out the activation of Xchk1. In exploring the mechanism by which the BRCT I-II region contributes to the checkpoint-regulatory function of XtopBP1, we examined potential binding partners of XtopBP1. Genetic and biochemical studies in a number of different organisms have indicated that the 9-1-1 complex and its equivalents interact with TopBP1 and its homologs (29St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 30399-30406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This binding involves C-terminal region of the Rad9 protein. We have found that XtopBP1 interacts strongly with the C-terminal domain of Xrad9. The BRCT I-II region of XtopBP1 is both necessary and sufficient for binding to the C-terminal section of Xrad9. About 20–40 amino acids from the extreme C-terminal end of Xrad9 are involved in this interaction. Furthermore, this binding requires phosphorylation of Xrad9 on Ser-373. This interaction is functionally important for checkpoint regulation. For example, a mutant 9-1-1 complex containing an S373A version of the Xrad9 subunit is compromised in checkpoint signaling. Moreover, a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal region of Xrad9 (GST-Xrad9C) is an effective dominant-negative inhibitor of the activation of Xchk1 in egg extracts. By contrast, the corresponding S373A mutant of GST-Xrad9C has no effect on the activation of Xchk1. Altogether, the results indicate that interaction of Ser-373-phosphorylated Xrad9 with the BRCT I-II region of XtopBP1 is essential for checkpoint control. Fission yeast Cut5 and budding yeast Dpb11, the relatives of TopBP1 in these organisms, interact with Rad9 and its budding yeast homologue Ddc1, respectively, through C-terminal regions containing BRCT repeats III-IV (30Furuya K. Poitelea M. Guo L. Caspari T. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1154-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 37Wang H. Elledge S.J. Genetics. 2002; 160: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This finding apparently contrasts with our observation that the N-terminal BRCT I-II region of XtopBP1 associates with Xrad9. However, the yeast proteins are considerably smaller than vertebrate TopBP1 and possess only four BRCT repeats, as opposed to eight in the vertebrate proteins. Furthermore, the AAD is not obviously conserved in fission yeast Cut5 and budding yeast Dpb11. Indeed, the AAD appears to be strongly conserved only in vertebrates. In general, it appears that the yeast and vertebrate versions of TopBP1 are similar in that they are involved in both DNA replication and checkpoint control (7Garcia V. Furuya K. Carr A.M. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2005; 4: 1227-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there are substantial structural differences between the yeast and vertebrate forms of these proteins. In a previous study, Mäkiniemi et al. (38Mäkiniemi M. Hillukkala T. Tuusa J. Reini K. Vaara M. Huang D. Pospiech H. Majuri I. Westerling T. Makela T.P. Syväoja J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30399-30406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) found in yeast two-hybrid experiments that human TopBP1 interacts with human Rad9 through BRCT repeats IV-V. However, these authors did not carry out studies in human cells or biochemical experiments to establish that BRCT IV-V was either necessary or sufficient for binding of Rad9. Furthermore, these investigators did not examine whether this region was involved in checkpoint regulation. Overall, we believe that we have provided convincing evidence that the BRCT I-II region of XtopBP1 mediates a functionally important interaction with Xrad9 in the egg-extract system. In human cells, Ser-387 of Rad9 (the equivalent of Ser-373 in Xrad9) is constitutively phosphorylated during the cell cycle (29St. Onge R.P. Besley B.D. Pelley J.L. Davey S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26620-26628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylation of this residue does not require the presence of DNA damage or stalled DNA replication forks. Consistent with this observation, we have found that GST-Xrad9C can associate with endogenous XtopBP1 in interphase egg extracts even in the absence of a checkpoint-inducing DNA template. This type of apparently constitutive process would allow the XtopBP1-Xrad9 complex to function at a very early step in the initiation of checkpoint signaling. Because this binding would not be dependent on regulation by an upstream checkpoint-signaling kinase, this complex could respond directly to checkpoint-triggering signals in the genome. Interestingly, the sequences around Ser-387 and Ser-373 in human Rad9 and Xrad9, respectively, resemble the consensus for phosphorylation by casein kinase 2, which is constitutively active throughout the cell cycle (39Meggio F. Pinna L.A. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 349-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1118) Google Scholar). The 9-1-1 complex is thought to recognize recessed DNA ends that would abut regions of single-stranded DNA at replication forks and sites of damages (17Ellison V. Stillman B.

Single-stranded DNA, which is coated with replication protein A, attracts the binding of inactive ATR-ATRIP in various systems (12Kumagai A. Kim S.-M. Dunphy W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49599-49608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 41Zou L. Elledge S.J.

Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1040-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Xatr-Xatrip undergoes activation upon binding of XtopBP1 (9Kumagai A. Lee J. Yoo H.Y. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2006; 124: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, 21Hashimoto Y. Tsujimura T. Sugino A. Takisawa H.

Interaction of XtopBP1 with the 9-1-1 complex may allow XtopBP1 to activate Xatr-Xatrip when both recessed DNA ends and single-stranded DNA are present (Fig. 7). In principle, binding of the 9-1-1 complex to XtopBP1 could be involved in the activation of Xatr or the recognition of downstream substrates by Xatr or both. Our findings are most consistent with a role for 9-1-1 in the events leading to the formation of fully activated Xatr. First, 9-1-1 interacts well with the established direct activator of Xatr, namely XtopBP1. Second, 9-1-1 associates with the region of XtopBP1 (i.e. BRCT I-II) that is necessary for both binding and activation of Xatr. Finally, the isolated C-terminal domain of Rad9 acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor that blocks binding of Xatr to XtopBP1 and hence forestalls activation of Xatr. It is possible that, in addition to localizing XtopBP1 near Xatr-Xatrip, the 9-1-1 complex may also trigger structural changes in XtopBP1 that would allow interaction with Xatr-Xatrip. We suspect that XtopBP1 may exist in a repressed form that would be incapable of activating Xatr inappropriately in the absence of a checkpoint-triggering signal. Interaction of the BRCT I-II region of XtopBP1 with the 9-1-1 complex on a checkpoint-triggering DNA structure may alleviate this repressed state. The situation appears to be somewhat different in budding yeast. Majka et al. (43Majka J. Niedziela-Majka A. Burgers P.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 891-901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) presented evidence that a recombinant version of the 9-1-1 complex from this organism (Ddc1-Mec3-Rad17) could activate Mec1-Ddc2 (ATR-ATRIP) directly in vitro. By contrast, the Xenopus 9-1-1 complex recruits XtopBP1, apparently the most proximal activator of Xatr-Xatrip. The exact roles of fission yeast Cut5 and budding yeast Dpb11 in checkpoint activation are not clear. Because these proteins appear to lack an obvious AAD, they may not interact with ATR in the same manner as TopBP1. However, Cut5 does associate with Rad3 (ATR) in fission yeast during checkpoint responses (30Furuya K. Poitelea M. Guo L. Caspari T. Carr A.M. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1154-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this interaction requires phosphorylation of Rad9 on T412. Moreover, checkpoint-regulated phosphorylation of both Cut5 and Crb2 is dependent upon the Thr-412 site in Rad9. Thus, it appears that Rad9 regulates Rad3-dependent signaling in this system. Further study of how XtopBP1 and Cut5/Dpb11 respond to DNA structures should provide additional insight into the earliest steps in checkpoint-signaling pathways.

https://openalex.org/W1978570121,"We recently showed that mucus from patients with ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the colon, is characterized by a low level of phosphatidylcholine (PC) while clinical studies reveal that therapeutic addition of PC using slow release preparations is beneficial. The positive role of PC in this disease is still elusive. Here we tested the hypothesis that exogenous application of PC has anti-inflammatory properties using three model systems. First, human Caco-2 cells were treated with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) to induce a pro-inflammatory response via activation of NF-κB. Second, latex bead phagosomes were analyzed for their ability to assemble actin in vitro, a process linked to pro-inflammatory signaling and correlating with the growth versus killing of mycobacteria in macrophages. The third system used was the rapid assembly of plasma membrane actin in macrophages in response to sphingosine 1-phosphate. TNF-α induced a pro-inflammatory response in Caco-2 cells, including 1) assembly of plasma membrane actin; 2) activation of both MAPKs ERK and p38; 3) transport of NF-κB subunits to the nucleus; and 4) subsequent up-regulation of the synthesis of pro-inflammatory gene products. Exogenous addition of most PCs tested significantly inhibited these processes. Other phospholipids like sphingomyelin or phosphatidylethanolamine showed no effects in these assays. PC also inhibited latex bead phagosome actin assembly, the killing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages, and the sphingosine 1-phosphate-induced actin assembly in macrophages. TNF-α induces the activation of signaling molecules and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in human intestinal cells. Exogenous application of PC blocks pro-inflammatory signaling in Caco-2 cells, in phagosomes in vitro and facilitates intracellular survival of mycobacteria. We provide further evidence that actin assembly by membranes is part of the pro-inflammatory response. Collectively, these results provide a molecular foundation for the clinical studies showing a beneficial effect of PC therapy in ulcerative colitis.

Exogenous application of PC blocks pro-inflammatory signaling in Caco-2 cells, in phagosomes in vitro and facilitates intracellular survival of mycobacteria. We provide further evidence that actin assembly by membranes is part of the pro-inflammatory response. Collectively, these results provide a molecular foundation for the clinical studies showing a beneficial effect of PC therapy in ulcerative colitis. Intestinal epithelial cells are critical to the barrier and absorptive functions of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, growing evidence suggests that these cells, which line the luminal surface of the gut, act as sentinels of the mucosal immune system (1Maaser C. Kagnoff M.F. Z. Gastroenterol. 2002; 40: 525-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Intestinal epithelial cells express numerous receptors, adhesion molecules, and pro-inflammatory mediators that allow them to communicate with the immune system. Intestinal epithelial cells are protected against injurious contents of the intestinal lumen by a surface barrier, which consists in part of a continuous, hydrophobic, and adherent mucus layer. This mucus represents a hydrated polymeric gel with a thickness of 50–500 μm (2Wallace J.L. Granger D.N. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 3Lichtenberger L.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 565-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Phospholipids are an important part of the intestinal mucus. They are described as a continuous layer at the luminal side of the mucus gel, both within the mucus as liposome-like aggregates and as a monolayer at the surface of the mucosal cells (4Kao Y.C.

The function of phospholipids in the mucus is not yet clear, but there is growing evidence that phospholipids are largely responsible for establishing the hydrophobic surface and, therefore, play a key role in the barrier properties of the underlying tissue. A protective function of phospholipids in the gut has been suggested in the literature (3Lichtenberger L.M. Annu. Rev.

Exogenous PC inhibits inflammation in trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid or acetic acid-induced colitis and is described to be anti-fibrinogenetic (24Mourelle M. Guarner F. Malagelada J.R.

Digestion. 1992; 53: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that a model organelle system, latex bead phagosomes, can assemble actin filaments de novo and in vitro. Many lipids were found to regulate this system. Some, such as arachidonic acid or PE, were positive regulators, whereas others, such as eicosapentanoic acid and, notably PC, inhibited the system (26Anes E. Kuhnel M.P. Bos E. Moniz-Pereira J. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The positive regulators tend to show pro-inflammatory properties. Adding them to macrophages infected with pathogenic mycobacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis resulted in an induction of pathogen killing, whereas in their absence M. tuberculosis grow intracellularly. In contrast, the application of the anti-inflammatory lipid eicosapentanoic acid facilitated a significant increase in pathogen growth. Eicosapentanoic acid is also known to have beneficial effects in ulcerative colitis (UC) (27Aslan A. Triadafilopoulos G. Am. J. Gastroenterol. 1992; 87: 432-437PubMed Google Scholar, 28Belluzzi A. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2002; 61: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These data have led to the hypothesis that the membrane-catalyzed assembly of actin is one of the first reactions of the pro-inflammatory response (26Anes E. Kuhnel M.P. Bos E. Moniz-Pereira J. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 29Anes E. Peyron P. Staali L. Jordao L. Gutierrez M.G. Kress H. Hagedorn M.

Here, we tested the effects of different PCs on the latex bead phagosomes actin assembly in vitro and examined natural phosphatidylcholine in macrophages infected with pathogenic mycobacteria M. tuberculosis.A number of ligands for plasma membrane receptors, such as epidermal growth factor induce within seconds a transient assembly of actin filaments underneath the plasma membrane (30Omann G.M.

Cell. 1993; 74: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We recently showed that the sphingolipid sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) induces a 5- to 15-s transient peak of actin assembly in RAW and J774 macrophages. 6G. Griffiths and M. Kuehnel, personal communication. 6G. Griffiths and M. Kuehnel, personal communication. Since we hypothesized that this process represents an early stage in a pro-inflammatory response, we also tested the role of PC application to macrophages on this process.We have previously shown that mucus from UC patients is characterized by a low level of the major phospholipid PC, whereas a clinical study reveals that the therapeutic addition of a PC-rich preparation to the colonic mucus is beneficial for UC patients (9Ehehalt R. Wagenblast J. Erben G. Lehmann W.D. Hinz U. Merle U. Stremmel W. Scand. J. Gastroenterol. 2004; 39: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Stremmel W. Merle U. Zahn A. Autschbach F. Hinz U. Ehehalt R. Gut. 2005; 54: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In a prospective, double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled study the benefit of an oral PC preparation with retarded release was evaluated in 60 patients with chronic active ulcerative colitis. All but one patient in the PC group experienced a decrease of the clinical activity index by 70% compared with only three patients in the placebo group, and 53% even attained clinical remission (clinical activity index ≤ 3) (10Stremmel W. Merle U. Zahn A. Autschbach F. Hinz U. Ehehalt R. Gut. 2005; 54: 966-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Collectively, the available studies argue that phospholipids may have a potential for the therapy of human inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about the mechanisms by which PC shows beneficial properties.In the main part of this study we addressed the anti-inflammatory role of PC in intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2). An important regulator of epithelial function during inflammation is the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Its levels are elevated in both human inflammatory bowel disease and animal models of intestinal inflammation. Importantly, TNF-α induces profound changes in epithelial function, including alterations in permeability (32Marano C.W. Lewis S.A. Garulacan L.A. Soler A.P. Mullin J.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 161: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), cell cycle progression (33Kaiser G.C. Polk D.B. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 1231-1240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), nutrient absorption (34Mehran M. Seidman E. Marchand R. Gurbindo C. Levy E. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G953-G960Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and gene expression (35Yang S.K. Eckmann L. Panja A. Kagnoff M.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1214-1223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). We provide evidence that exogenously added PC, applied to either the apical or the basolateral surfaces, was integrated into the cells and significantly inhibited TNF-α-induced inflammatory responses. Collectively, our data argue that PC is an important player in pro-inflammatory signaling cascades.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESLipids and Reagents—TNF-α (Promega, Madison, WI) was dissolved in water containing 1% BSA (Sigma). The natural l-α-phosphatidylcholine mixture (1,2-diacylglycero-3-phosphocholine from bovine brain), 1,2-didodecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-PC, 1,2-tetradecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-PC, 1,2-dieicosanoyl-sn-glycero-3-PC, 1,2-didocosanoyl-sn-glycero-3-PC, 1,2-dioleyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, and all other lipids described in this study were from Sigma. 1-Pentadecanoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-arachidoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 1-Palmitoylglycero-3-phosphatidyl-[14C]choline ([14C]LPC, 55 mCi/1 mm) and [methyl-3H]choline-l-dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (50 Ci/1 mm) were purchased from New England Nuclear (Boston, MA). S1P was dissolved in ethanol (5 mm). Solvents without lipids were routinely tested, referred to in the figures as “controls.”Cells and Bacteria—Caco-2w cells are a subclone of the human Caco-2BBe that were selected because of their well differentiated phenotype and provided by J. R. Turner (University of Chicago). Cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 1% non-essential amino acid and antibiotics (55 IU/ml penicillin and 55 μg/ml streptomycin). Vero cells (American Type Culture Collection (ATCC)) were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (55 IU/ml penicillin and 55 μg/ml streptomycin). The J774A.1 mouse macrophage cell line as well as the strains Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 and M. tuberculosis H37Rv were maintained as previously described (26Anes E. Kuhnel M.P. Bos E. Moniz-Pereira J. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 29Anes E. Peyron P. Staali L. Jordao L. Gutierrez M.G. Kress H. Hagedorn M. Maridonneau-Parini I. Skinner M.A. Wildeman A.G. Kalamidas S.A. Kuehnel M. Griffiths G. Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 939-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Macrophages RAW 264.7 and J774 A.1 were grown as described in Anes, et al. (26Anes E. Kuhnel M.P. Bos E. Moniz-Pereira J. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar).Mycobacterial Infection—Infections with M. tuberculosis H37Rv were done as described in Anes, et al. (26Anes E. Kuhnel M.P. Bos E. Moniz-Pereira J. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). After 2 days a J774 confluency of 80–90% was reached, and cells were infected with bacteria at an A600 of 0.1. To test the effect of PC on intracellular survival, a 10 μm preparation of a natural PC mixture from bovine brain (Sigma, p3811) was added to infected macrophages after 1 h of bacterial uptake. Every 2 days the old medium was replaced by fresh medium also containing a fresh PC preparation. At indicated times intracellular bacteria were recovered by lyses of infected macrophages using a 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma) solution in water and plated on 7H10 agar containing oleic acid albumin dextrose complex. Colony-forming unit counting was carried out as described before.Gene Expression Analyses by Real-time PCR Quantification—Caco-2 cells were grown under standard conditions in 6 wells for 48 h to 80% confluence, washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum, and incubated with 10 ng/ml recombinant human TNF-α (R&D Systems) together with either PC 16:0/16:0 (1,2-dipalmitoylglycero-3-PC), LPC 16:0 (1-palmitoylglycero-3-PC), or PE for various times at 37 °C. Approximately 1 × 106 cells were collected in 300 μl of lysis buffer from the MagnaPure mRNA Isolation Kit I (RAS, Mannheim, Germany), and mRNA was isolated with the Magna-Pure-LC device using the mRNA-I standard protocol. RNA was reverse transcribed using reverse transcriptase from avian myeloblastosis virus and oligo(dT) as primer (First Strand cDNA synthesis kit, RAS) according to the manufacturer's protocol in a thermocycler. Primer sets specific for the sequences of selected genes (interleukin-8, interferon γ-inducible protein-10, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1) optimized for the Light-Cycler (RAS) were developed and provided by SEARCH-LC GmbH, Heidelberg. The PCR was performed with the Light-Cycler FastStart DNA Sybr Green I kit (RAS) according to the protocol provided in the parameter specific kits. To correct for differences in the content of mRNA, the calculated copy numbers were normalized according to the average expression of two housekeeping genes (cyclophilin B and β-actin). Values were thus given as input adjusted to copy number per microliter of cDNA.Immunoblotting—Caco-2 cells were seeded on collagen-coated, permeable polycarbonate filters (0.4-μm pore size, Costar, Cambridge, MA) and grown for 2–3 weeks to get polarized. Compared with non-polarized cells, for the stimulation of the monolayer of polarized Caco-2 cells a higher amount of TNF-α (50 ng/ml) was necessary that was added to the basolateral buffer. Cells were pretreated with a 200 μm preparation of PC 16:0/16:0 (1,2-dipalmitoylglycero-3-PC) applied either to the basolateral or apical surface for 1 h before stimulation. Cells were lysed in protein loading buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol). Protein concentrations were measured and equal amounts of total cell lysates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed for various MAPKs. Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight with the primary antibodies. The antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology and used as follows: anti-phospho-MAPK (1:1000 in 5% BSA, rabbit), anti-phospho-p38 (1:1000 5% BSA, rabbit), and anti-phospho-JNK1/2 (1:1000 in 5% BSA, rabbit). Secondary staining was conducted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000 in 5% skimmed milk) followed by chemiluminescent detection with a commercial ECL reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Comparisons were made only among samples isolated and transferred onto the same membrane. To confirm equal loading of protein, all Western blots using phospho-specific antibodies were stripped and re-probed with antibodies against the non-phosphorylated kinases.Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Caco-2 cells were seeded on glass slides in 12-wells to 80% confluence, washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without serum and incubated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and selected phospholipids (200 μm) for various times. Cells were fixed for 15 min with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized for 5 min with 0.1% Triton X-100, and incubated in blocking solution (0.2% gelatin in phosphate-buffered saline) for 30 min. Permeabilized cells were then incubated with a monoclonal mouse anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.2% gelatin and incubated with the appropriate Cy™3-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at room temperature for 1 h, and nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Specimens were examined with an Olympus IX50 fluorescence microscope. For quantification, ten randomly chosen pictures were taken from one coverslip. An individual not involved in recording scored cells presented on the picture in three categories: 1) strong activation (NF-κB found in the nucleus), 2) intermediate activation (NF-κB was equally distributed in nucleus and cytoplasm), and 3) no activation (NF-κB mainly in cytoplasm). The percentages of cells in each class of three independent experiments were expressed.Transient Transfection and Reporter Assays—Caco-2 cells seeded in 12-wells were grown to a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml and transiently transfected with a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). 20 h after transfection, cells were incubated in medium with or without TNF-α (10 ng/ml) and with different concentrations of a PC 18:2/18:2 (1,2-dilinoleoylglycero-3-PC) preparation for 4 h at 37 °C. Luciferase activity was assayed using the Luciferase Assay Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's directions and detected with a Fluorostar Optima (BMG Labtech). Each transfection was done in triplicate and repeated at least three times.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Caco-2 cells grown in 10-cm2 dishes were stimulated with TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 1 h. The nuclear extracts were prepared using a standard protocol. Nuclear protein was incubated with 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (Amersham Biosciences). Labeling of oligonucleotides NF-κB (sense and antisense) was performed using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions. Nuclear extracts were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with labeled oligonucleotides and separated by electrophoresis in a 6% TBE (Tris base, boric acid, and EDTA) non-denaturating 5% acrylamide gel. Autoradiography was conducted at -70 °C with Kodak X-OMAT film. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were also scanned with a Fujifilm BAS-1500 phosphorimaging device. The specificity of the oligonucleotides was confirmed by competition with excess unlabeled probe.Radioactive Uptake Assay Using [3H]PC and [14C]LPC followed by TLC Analyses—Caco-2 cells were grown to 80% confluence in 5-cm2 dishes and incubated for 30 min either with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-3-phosphatidyl-[N-methyl-3H]choline (81 Ci/1 mm) and 1,2-dipalmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine (PC 16:0/16:0) or with [14C]LPC (55 mCi/1 mm) and 1-dipalmitoylglycero-3-phosphocholine (LPC, 16:0) in a ratio of 1:250. After washing cells were incubated with NaOH (1 m) for 10 min. Both the cell lysates and the supernatants were analyzed with counting solution in a scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter LS 6500). For TLC phospholipids were extracted from the cell lysates with methanol/chloroform using a standard method described in Folch et al. in 1956 (63Folch J. Lees G.H. Sloane-Stanley A. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and applied to Silica Gel 60 plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). Plates were developed in chloroform/methanol/water (70/25/5, v/v), and phospholipids were visualized using Dittmer-Lester reagent. PC-containing spots as well as equally sized regions of the silica plate above and below the PC spots were scraped off, and the respective radioactivity was quantified.Actin Assembly Assay—The preparation of latex bead phagosomes was done as described previously (26Anes E. Kuhnel M.P. Bos E. Moniz-Pereira J. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The actin assembly assay was performed under standard conditions using 0.2 mm ATP and rhodamine actin buffered with thymosin β-4 (Defacque et al. (36Defacque H. Egeberg M. Habermann A. Diakonova M. Roy C. Mangeat P. Voelter W. Marriott G. Pfannstiel J. Faulstich H. Griffiths G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)). Controls were performed in the presence of an equal amount of ethanol, which was used as a solvent for the different PC species.Quantification of F-actin—Caco-2 cells were seeded in 24-wells and grown to a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml. After 24 h cells were pretreated with a 200 μm preparation of PC 18:2/18:2 (1,2-dilinoleoylglycero-3-PC) in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. After pretreatment the cells were stimulated with TNF-α (50 ng/ml) for various times at 37 °C. A 5 μm preparation of S1P in ethanol was used to stimulate RAW macrophages with a final concentration of 10 nm S1P. Cells were seeded as described above and stimulated with S1P (10 nm) for 5 and 10 s after pretreatment with a 200 μm preparation of either PC 18:2/18:2 (1,2-dilinoleoylglycero-3-PC) or PC 16:0/16:0 (1,2-dipalmitoylglycero-3-PC) in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 3 min. F-actin was stained with phalloidin-TRITC (Sigma) for 30 min and extracted with methanol for 1 h (36Defacque H. Egeberg M. Habermann A. Diakonova M. Roy C. Mangeat P. Voelter W. Marriott G.

Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1078-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The supernatant was measured for fluorescence at excitation of 550 nm and emission of 570 nm to detect the relative amount of F-actin.RESULTSEffect of Different PC Species on Actin Assembly in Vitro by Latex Bead Phagosomes—Recent studies using an in vitro phagosome actin assembly assay have led to the hypothesis that PC inhibits pro-inflammatory signaling networks in membranes (26Anes E. Kuhnel M.P. Bos E. Moniz-Pereira J. Habermann A. Griffiths G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the work presented here, we analyzed a variety of PC species in this system in which the polymerization of rhodamine actin filaments is monitored on the surface of latex bead phagosomes (26Anes E.

This study was performed to examine the role of hydrogen sulfide in the resolution of injury; specifically, the healing of gastric ulcers. Ulcers were induced in rats by serosal application of acetic acid. This elicited a marked increase in gastric expression of the two key enzymes in hydrogen sulfide synthesis (cystathionine-beta-synthase and cystathionine-gamma-lyase) and in hydrogen sulfide synthesis. Twice-daily treatment for a week with hydrogen sulfide donors significantly increased the extent of healing of gastric ulcers as compared to vehicle-treatment. Similar treatment with L-cysteine, a precursor for hydrogen sulfide, also accelerated healing of the ulcers, and the effect was abolished by cotreatment with an inhibitor of cystathionine-gamma-lyase. The beneficial effects of hydrogen sulfide on ulcer healing were not dependent on nitric oxide synthesis, nor did they appear to occur through activation of ATP-sensitive K+ channels. These results suggest that hydrogen sulfide is produced in the gastric mucosa in response to injury and acts to promote healing. The results further suggest that drugs releasing hydrogen sulfide could be employed to accelerate healing of gastric ulcers, and possibly of other wounds."

To gain insights into the mechanism of PP1 regulation by inhibitor-2, an ancient and intrinsically disordered regulator, we solved the crystal structure of the complex to 2.5Å resolution. Our studies show that, when complexed with PP1c, I-2 acquires three regions of order: site 1, residues 12-17, binds adjacent to a region recognized by many PP1 regulators; site 2, amino acids 44-56, interacts along the RVXF binding groove through an unsuspected sequence, KSQKW; and site 3, residues 130-169, forms α-helical regions that lie across the substrate-binding cleft. Specifically, residues 148-151 interact at the catalytic center, displacing essential metal ions, accounting for both rapid inhibition and slower inactivation of PP1c. Thus, our structure provides novel insights into the mechanism of PP1 inhibition and subsequent reactivation, has broad implications for the physiological regulation of PP1, and highlights common inhibitory interactions among phosphoprotein phosphatase family members.

Phosphorylation, a fundamental mechanism for the regulation of protein function, is mediated by the coordinated action of protein kinases and phosphatases. Protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) 6The abbreviations used are: PPprotein phosphatasePP1cPP1 catalytic subunitI-2inhibitor-2GSKglycogen synthase kinase. is a major Ser/Thr protein phosphatase that controls a myriad of cellular processes such as glycogen metabolism, muscle contraction, cell cycle, gene expression, and neuronal activity. The pleiotropic actions of PP1 are determined by its associated regulatory components that direct the enzyme to various subcellular compartments in the proximity of substrates and/or modulate phosphatase activity (1Cohen P.T.

The human genome contains only three PP1 catalytic subunit (PP1c) genes encoding four isoforms α, δ/β, γ1, and γ2, with the latter two generated by alternative splicing. However, close to 100 PP1c-binding proteins have been reported, the majority of which contain an RVXF, or its variant RXVXF, motif that binds to a hydrophobic surface groove located on a surface behind the PP1c active site (4Egloff M.P.

The ability of multiple proteins to bind by this mechanism in part accounts for the wide range of functions performed by this phosphatase. protein phosphatase PP1 catalytic subunit inhibitor-2 glycogen synthase kinase. Inhibitor-2 (I-2) was the first protein phosphatase regulator identified (5Huang F.L. Glinsmann W.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 70: 419-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and is widely expressed from yeast to man. Mammalian I-2 forms a stable and high affinity (Kd = ∼2 nm) (6Picking W.D.

Although the molecular basis for its action has remained unclear, the ability of I-2 to rapidly inhibit PP1 was a critical tool for the identification of PP1 activity in many eukaryotes. I-2 also promotes a slower “inactivation” of PP1c (8Jurgensen S. Shacter E. Huang C.Y. Chock P.B. Yang S.D. Vandenheede J.R. Merlevede W. J. Biol.

The reactivation of the latent PP1c·I-2 complex is triggered by phosphorylation of I-2 at Thr72 by several protein kinases, 7Prior residue numbering for the mammalian forms of inhibitor-2 has started with the first residue after the initiator methionine on the basis of protein sequencing experiments. This manuscript will adopt the HUGO recommendations and begin numbering at the initiator methionine. Mouse I-2 has a one-residue insertion at homologous position 21, consequently residues C-terminal to this insertion will be incremented by two (i.e. Thr74 versus Thr72). including GSK-3, ERKs (extracellular signal-regulated kinases), and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) (11Hemmings B.A. Resink T.J.

Transgenic expression of I-2 in mice suggests that I-2-mediated inhibition of PP1 regulates cardiac contractility (14Kirchhefer U. Baba H.A. Boknik P. Breeden K.M. Mavila N. Bruchert N. Justus I. Matus M. Schmitz W. Depaoli-Roach A.A. Neumann J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2005; 68: 98-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Other studies that localized I-2 at centrosomes have noted dynamic changes in Thr72 phosphorylation during mitosis (15Leach C. Shenolikar S. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26015-26020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for the PP1·I-2 complex in cell division. Oxidative stress in neuronal cells, which increased I-2 phosphorylation and PP1 activation (16Zambrano C.A. Egana J.T. Nunez M.T. Maccioni R.B. Gonzalez-Billault C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2004; 36: 1393-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), also hint at a role for the ATP-Mg2+-dependent protein phosphatase in controlling neuronal survival. Thus, understanding the molecular basis by which I-2 modulates PP1 function is critical for establishing the physiological and pathophysiological role of the PP1·I-2 complex and assessing the contribution of dynamic control of this protein phosphatase complex in human health and disease. The purified I-2 protein has a low sedimentation coefficient (1.75 S) and a large Stokes radius (3.5 nm) and is both heat- and acid-stable. These properties are consistent with the mostly random coil structure suggested by solution NMR, which showed only a single area of weak α-helix comprising residues 135-143 (17Huang H.B. Chen Y.C. Tsai L.H. Wang H. Lin F.M. Horiuchi A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Shiao M.S. Lin T.H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 359-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). I-2 appears to belong to a class of intrinsically disordered proteins that acquire structure when associated with partner molecules (18Garner E. Romero P. Dunker A.K. Brown C. Obradovic Z. Genome Inform. 1999; 10: 41-50PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report the structure of the rat PP1cγ and mouse I-2 complex to 2.5 Å resolution. Analysis of this structure provides new insights into the mechanism by which I-2 inhibits and inactivates PP1c and highlights common structural determinants that mediate the inhibition of protein serine/threonine phosphatases. Expression, Purification, and Activity Measurements—The complex between rat PP1cγ1 and mouse I-2 was produced through coexpression of the two proteins in Escherichia coli BL21 cells using two vectors. The rat His-tagged PP1cγ, in which six histidine codons were introduced at the N terminus, was expressed using the pTacTac vector (19De Boer H.A. Comstock L.J. Vasser M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 21-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), and the mouse I-2 was expressed using a modified pACYC vector (New England Biolabs) to introduce a T7 promoter. The proteins were produced by induction with isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubation of the cells overnight at 16 °C. The cells were lysed using a French pressure cell and a clarified supernatant obtained by centrifugation at 100,000 × g. The complex was purified without the addition of supplemental MnCl2 in a two-step procedure where nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography was directly followed by gel filtration on a Superdex G75 column. The complex was greater than 95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE. The in vitro reconstituted complexes were prepared by modification of a previously described procedure (20Yang J. Hurley T.D. DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22635-22644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, PP1cγ or PP1cα prepared in the present of Mn2+ were incubated with a 2-fold molar excess recombinant rabbit I-2 for 30-40 min at room temperature. The excess I-2 was removed by using a Centricon-50 centrifugal concentrator with repeated centrifugations and redilution until no I-2 could be detected in the effluent. Complex formation and absence of free polypeptides were verified by native PAGE (see Fig. 1a). As the free PP1c did not enter the native gel under the conditions used, analysis of the complexes by SDS-PAGE was performed, which indicated that I-2 and PP1c were present at an apparent equimolar ratio (data not shown). The native PP1c·I-2 complex was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle as previously described (21DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity was measured using glycogen phosphorylase a as a substrate, where an appropriately diluted phosphatase sample was incubated with 1 mg/ml 32P-labeled phosphorylase a (300-400 cpm/pmol) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2% 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm caffeine, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation and 32Pi release monitored by scintillation counting. Activation of the PP1c·I-2 complex was measured by preincubation with GSK-3β in the presence of ATP and magnesium acetate, prior to assaying for phosphatase activity. The reaction conditions were typically 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm ATP, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 μg/ml GSK-3β, and 0.4 μg/ml of the complex for 10 min at 30 °C with or without the presence of 0.2 mm manganese chloride. To measure reactivation by trypsin/Mn2+, the complex was incubated with 1 μg/ml trypsin, ± 0.6 mm MnCl2 for 5 min at 30 °C. Soybean trypsin inhibitor was added to stop the reaction, and phosphatase activity was measured as described above. Crystallization and Structure Determination—The crystals of the His-PP1cγ·I-2 complex were grown using sitting drop vapor diffusion from solutions containing 7 mg/ml of the complex. Two separate conditions were found to produce crystals of the complex. The first condition contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm potassium acetate, 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, and the second condition contained 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.6, 150 mm sodium citrate, and 20% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. Stable crystals were obtained at 15 °C after ∼10 days of incubation. The crystals were flash frozen following the introduction of 25% ethylene glycol in a rapid two-step procedure. All of the diffraction data were collected at beamline 19-ID at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data reduction and scaling was accomplished using HKL2000 (22Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). The structure of the complex was solved using the program AMoRe (23Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar) with the structure of human PP1cγ (4Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) as the search model. Electron density maps produced using this model showed the presence of strong positive difference features at three distinct locations on the surface of each PP1cγ subunit in the asymmetric unit (supplemental Fig. S1). The structure of I-2 was built into the available electron density using Coot (24Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23389) Google Scholar), and the resulting model was subjected to restrained refinement with tight noncrystallographic symmetry restraints on the main chain atoms and medium restraints on the side chain atoms using Refmac5 (25Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar). All structures show >98% of the residues in the allowed regions of their respective Ramachandran plots. Consistent with other PP1c structures, residues Asp95 and Arg96 in each PP1c subunit are found in the disallowed region. All of the I-2 residues fall within the most favored regions. Biochemical Properties of Native and Recombinant PP1c·I-2 Complexes—A PP1cγ1·I-2 complex was generated by coexpression of the two polypeptides in E. coli in the absence of added metal ions (26Zhang Z. Bai G. Deans-Zirattu S. Browner M.F. Lee E.Y.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1484-1490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior structural studies of PP1cα (27Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar) and PP1cγ (28Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar) utilized proteins expressed in E. coli in the presence of Mn2+, which was required for enzyme activity. Thus, we compared the biochemical properties of the purified coexpressed complex and a complex reconstituted in vitro by incubation of recombinant rabbit I-2 and rat PP1γ1 expressed in bacteria in the presence of Mn2+ with those of the native PP1·I-2 complex isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle (21DePaoli-Roach A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12144-12152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, b and c). Whereas the native enzyme was inactive until reactivated following incubation with GSK-3 and ATP-Mg2+, the in vitro reconstituted PP1·I-2 complex displayed readily measurable phosphorylase phosphatase activity that was not further increased following the addition of GSK-3 and ATP-Mg2+ (Fig. 1b). By contrast, the coexpressed PP1·I-2 complex, like the native complex, was inactive and could be activated to some extent by GSK-3 and ATP-Mg2+. Full activity of these complexes was observed only when Mn2+ was also included in the activation reaction. Digestion with trypsin in the presence of Mn2+ has been widely used to degrade regulatory subunits and reveal the full activity of the trypsin-resistant PP1 catalytic subunit (29Ballou L.M. Brautigan D.L. Fischer E.H. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 3393-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Indeed, all three PP1·I-2 complexes were fully reactivated by treatment with trypsin in the presence of Mn2+. However, only the reconstituted PP1·I-2 complex was significantly activated by trypsin alone (Fig. 1c), suggesting that PP1c was not fully inactivated in the reconstituted complex. Most importantly, despite the absence of added metal ions in the culture media, the PP1c from the coexpressed complex could be fully activated with a specific activity very similar to the native enzyme (Fig. 1, b and c) and isolated recombinant PP1c produced in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 1d). As anticipated, PP1c expressed in the absence of Mn2+ was inactive, even when metal ions were included in the phosphatase assay (Fig. 1d). These data suggested that the coexpressed PP1·I-2 complex more closely resembled the native ATP-Mg2+-dependent phosphatase complex. Structure of the PP1·I-2 Complex: PP1c Binding by I-2—Analysis of free I-2 by CD spectroscopy and through computational approaches (supplemental data and Figs. S2 and S3) suggests that the protein lacks ordered elements of secondary structure, which is consistent with the available NMR data. In contrast, both CD measurements and computational assessment of the propensity for ordered interactions with partner molecules suggest that I-2 can acquire ordered structure when in complex with PP1c (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). We solved two crystal structures of the stable complex formed between rat PP1cγ and mouse I-2 to 2.6 and 2.5 Å resolution, respectively (Table 1). Each crystal form contains two independent complexes in the asymmetric unit, and all of the complexes displayed the same mode of interaction between I-2 and PP1cγ within the resolution of the data. Crystals of the PP1·I-2 complex were dissolved and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and established that both proteins were present (data not shown).TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsPP1cγ·I-2 complexPotassium acetateSodium citrateSpace groupP212121P212121Cell dimensions (Å)a = 95.4, b = 103.5, c = 151.6a = 96.3, b = 103.2, c = 150.0Resolution (Å)43-2.61 (2.69-2.61)aParentheses indicate the data statistics for the highest resolution shell used for each structure.50-2.50 (2.59-2.50)Unique reflections44,46652,097Redundancy5.3 (5.2)5.4 (4.1)Completeness (%)95.8 (86.0)99.5 (95.9)<I>/σ<I>15.5 (2.7)18.4 (1.9)Rmerge0.085 (0.56)0.090 (0.61)RefinementResolution (Å)43-2.61 (2.68-2.61)50-2.50 (2.56-2.50)No. reflections44,46652,097Rwork/Rfree0.216/0.254 (0.294/0.379)0.194/0.235 (0.282/0.333)No. protein atoms57435745No. solvent atoms99243Average B-factor (PP1c)44.0 Å243.8 Å2Average B-factor (I-2 only)61.5 Å271.8 Å2Coordinate error (Rfree)0.26 Å0.24 ÅRoot mean square deviation bond lengths0.010 Å0.010 ÅRoot mean square deviation bond angles1.19°1.18°a Parentheses indicate the data statistics for the highest resolution shell used for each structure. Open table in a new tab The structure revealed three major regions of interaction between I-2 and PP1cγ (Fig. 2), all of which are highly conserved through evolution (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S4) and bury ∼4700 Å2 of surface area in the complex. The first and shortest region of interaction, site 1, involves residues 12-17 (KGILKN) (Fig. 4, a and b) and represents a mixture of hydrophobic associations and hydrogen bonds. For example, the side chain of I-2 Ile14 is buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed by residues Leu55, Phe119, and Leu59 in PP1cγ, whereas the side chain of Leu15 of I-2 is buried in a pocket formed by Pro50, Leu53, and Phe119 from PP1cγ. The remaining interactions are contributed by I-2 Lys12, Lys16, and Asn17. In particular, the side chain of I-2 Asn17 hydrogen bonds to the main chain carbonyl oxygen and main chain nitrogen of residues 52 and 54, respectively, and I-2 Lys16 hydrogen bonds to Asp166 in PP1cγ.FIGURE 2Observed structure of the PP1cγ·I-2 complex. a, the ribbon structure of PP1cγ is represented in blue, and that of I-2 is in magenta.

The sequence of residues in I-2 bound to this site is KSQKW where the Gln and Trp residues fill in the positions occupied by Val and Phe in many PP1 regulators. Similarly to the interactions with the Phe residue present in the peptide derived from RGL (4Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and the MYPT1 fragment (30Terrak M. Kerff F. Langsetmo K. Tao T. Dominguez R. Nature. 2004; 429: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), the aromatic side chain of I-2 Trp48 binds within the hydrophobic pocket formed by Leu243, Phe257, Cys291, and Phe293 of PP1cγ (Fig. 4d). I-2 Gln46 is located in the same pocket formed by Ile169, Leu243, Leu289, and Cys291 of PP1cγ, as is the Val residue present in the RGL and MYPT1 complexes. However, the most significant and unique interaction between I-2 and PP1cγ at this site is the side chain amide nitrogen of I-2 Gln46 that forms a hydrogen bond with the sulfhydryl group of PP1cγ Cys291 (Fig. 4d). In addition, the side chain of the first residue in this stretch, I-2 Lys44, interacts with PP1cγ Asp166, the same residue to which I-2 Lys16 forms a hydrogen bond. The Structure of the PP1·I-2 Complex: Mode of PP1c Inhibition by I-2—The longest contiguous stretch of interaction occurs between residues 130 and 169 of I-2 and the active site of PP1cγ. This stretch of I-2 adopts an extended α-helical structure that is disrupted by five residues between amino acids 149 and 153. Residues 130-146 lie along the “acidic groove,” to position amino acids 147-151 in the active site of PP1c, whereas residues 152-169 exit the active site to the adjacent proposed “hydrophobic substrate-binding groove ” of PP1cγ (Fig. 2a). The α-helix comprised of residues 130-140 includes the major ordered structure previously observed in solution NMR of I-2 (17Huang H.B. Chen Y.C. Tsai L.H. Wang H. Lin F.M. Horiuchi A. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Shiao M.S. Lin T.H. J. Biomol. NMR. 2000; 17: 359-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), suggesting that some of this structure was not induced by PP1 binding. Residues 163-168 also form a short helix, but neither these residues nor residues 130-140 show significant interactions with PP1c and, surprisingly, no symmetry contacts. The majority of specific interactions occurs near the center of this region and involves both hydrogen bonding and electrostatic with a few hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 5, a and b). A network of interactions occurs between His148, Tyr149, and Glu151 from I-2 and the active site of PP1cγ (Fig. 5c). His148, in particular, forms two key interactions, a side chain hydrogen bond to Tyr272 and main chain hydrogen bonds to Arg96 of PP1cγ. These interactions position I-2 Tyr149 to occupy the phosphoamino acid binding site of PP1cγ and results in the displacement of one or more of the metal ions located in the active site. Prior structures of PP1cα and PP1cγ showed a binuclear metal center, where M1 and M2 were both Mn2+ in PP1cα (27Goldberg J. Huang H.B. Kwon Y.G. Greengard P. Nairn A.C. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1995; 376: 745-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar), whereas the PP1cγ structure contained one Fe2+ and one Mn2+ (28Egloff M.P. Cohen P.T. Reinemer P. Barford D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 942-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). A key difference between these structures and that of our PP1c·I-2 complex is that the metal ion is missing from the M1 site in both of our crystal structures. The complex crystallized in the presence of acetate is missing both metal ions. In all of our structures, I-2 Tyr149 forms a hydrogen bond with an ordered water molecule that is positioned near the M1 metal site (Fig. 5c). This water is held in place through additional hydrogen bonds with the catalytic metal ligands, PP1cγ His66 and Asp64. The side chain of I-2 Asn150 forms a hydrogen bond with PP1cγ Tyr134, which lies adjacent to Arg96 in the active site. Lastly, I-2 Glu151 hydrogen bonds to PP1cγ Arg96 and His125 and interacts with PP1cγ Arg221 through a water molecule. In summary, the interactions of residues 148-151 from I-2 within the catalytic site of PP1c most likely mediate the inhibitory action. Importance of the PP1·I-2 Structure—The three-dimensional structure of PP1c was first resolved over a decade ago and highlighted key features of a bimetallic catalytic center and an overall pattern of protein folding conserved in other protein serine/threonine phosphatases (31Cho U.S. Xu W.

https://openalex.org/W1988862655,"Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a family of multifunctional serine/threonine phosphatases all composed of a catalytic C, a structural A, and a regulatory B subunit. Assembly of the complex with the appropriate B subunit forms the key to the functional specificity and regulation of PP2A. Emerging evidence suggests a crucial role for methylation and phosphorylation of the PP2A C subunit in this process. In this study, we show that PP2A C subunit methylation was not absolutely required for binding the PR61/B′ and PR72/B″ subunit families, whereas binding of the PR55/B subunit family was determined by methylation and the nature of the C-terminal amino acid side chain. Moreover mutation of the phosphorylatable Tyr307 or Thr304 residues differentially affected binding of distinct B subunit family members. Down-regulation of the PP2A methyltransferase LCMT1 by RNA interference gradually reduced the cellular amount of methylated C subunit and induced a dynamic redistribution of the remaining methylated PP2AC between different PP2A trimers consistent with their methylation requirements. Persistent knockdown of LCMT1 eventually resulted in specific degradation of the PR55/B subunit and apoptotic cell death. Together these results establish a crucial foundation for understanding PP2A regulatory subunit selection.

It is estimated that, depending on the cell type, PP2A holoenzymes are responsible for 30–50% of the total cellular serine/threonine dephosphorylating activity, demonstrating the importance of this enzyme system for almost any aspect of life.The basis of this broad functional importance is formed by the diversity of specific PP2A subunit compositions. Typically the PP2A core enzyme exists as a dimer (PP2AD) consisting of a catalytic subunit (C subunit/PP2AC) and a scaffolding A subunit (PR65/A subunit). Proper functioning and regulation of PP2A is achieved by the association of regulatory B subunits 3To indicate the whole group of third regulatory B subunits (PR55/B, PR61/B′, and PR72/B″) we use the term B; to indicate the individual families we use the PR55/B, PR61/B′, and PR72/B″ terminology. 3To indicate the whole group of third regulatory B subunits (PR55/B, PR61/B′, and PR72/B″) we use the term B; to indicate the individual families we use the PR55/B, PR61/B′, and PR72/B″ terminology. with the PP2A core enzyme, resulting in the formation of heterotrimeric PP2A holoenzymes with specific catalytic properties, subcellular locations, and substrate specificities. At present, three multigene families of B-type subunits have been described, PR55/B, PR61/B′, and PR72/B″, all with specific cellular functions. Therefore, the assembly of the complex with the appropriate B-type subunit is the key to specificity and regulation of PP2A (2Janssens V. Goris J. Van Hoof C. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2005; 15: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). In this process, the highly conserved C-terminal PP2AC tail seems to play a crucial role (3Ogris E. Gibson D.M. Pallas D.C.

Recently a major breakthrough has been achieved by elucidating the crystal structure of a heterotrimeric PP2AT61γ holoenzyme (5Cho U.S. Xu W.

It was shown that the C-terminal PP2AC tail recognizes a surface groove at the interface between the PR65 and PR61γ subunits and is thus clearly in a crucial position to influence the binding of the B subunits. Remarkably this tail can undergo two types of post-translational modifications: phosphorylation and methylation. Phosphorylation of Tyr307 or of an unidentified threonine residue (potentially Thr304) was found to inactivate PP2A (7Chen J. Martin B.L. Brautigan D.L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10371-10376Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether these covalent modifications regulate the association of the other mammalian third B subunit families (PR61/B′ and PR72/B″) with PP2AD in a similar manner. Here we show that each B-type subunit family requires distinct modifications or structural features of the PP2AC C-terminal tail for trimeric assembly, and these requirements can even differ between members of the same subunit family. We demonstrate that selectivity for B-type subunits is based on the methylation state of the C subunit and that cells commit to apoptosis if the subunit composition is modified by manipulating methylation states. These findings represent a first step to understand dynamic subunit interchanges that would explain differential trimeric assembly of PP2A.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Antibodies—Plasmids used for the expression of GST- or HA-tagged fusion proteins were made by subcloning the appropriate human cDNAs in the pGMEX-T1,2,3 (Amersham Biosciences) and pMB001 vectors (25Gijsbers R. Ceulemans H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1361-1368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The indicated mutants of PP2ACα were made according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) with the appropriate primers and templates. All constructs and mutants were verified by DNA sequencing. The following primary antibodies were used in this study: mouse monoclonal anti-PP2AC and anti-PR65 antibodies as described previously (26Stevens I. Janssens V. Martens E. Dilworth S. Goris J. Van Hoof C. Eur. J.

The polyclonal rabbit anti-LCMT1 and anti-peptide antibodies against the C terminus of PP2AC (amino acids 299–309), specific for demethylated PP2AC, were described previously (12De Baere I. Derua R.

Zwaenepoel, C. Rosse, M. Petit, J. Goris, and P. Parker, manuscript in preparation. Cell Culture and DNA Transfection Assays—COS7 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-GlutaMAX (Invitrogen) containing 1 g/liter glucose (Invitrogen) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), and 10% fetal calf serum (Gentauer). 24 h after seeding, DNA was transfected into the cells with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Cell Extracts, GST Pulldown Assays, and Western Blotting—48 h after transfection, cells (10-cm plate) were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold NET lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 15 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). This suspension was briefly vortexed, and after 15 min of incubation on ice, it was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (the cell extract) was used for GST pulldown assays by adding 40 μl of 50% glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) and 500 μl of NENT-100 buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 25% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl) supplemented with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). After incubation of the mixture for 1 h on a rotating wheel at 4 °C, the beads were washed three times with NENT-100 buffer without bovine serum albumin. Bound proteins were eluted by addition of 25 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiling. The eluted proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with the indicated primary antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Dako) followed by detection with the ECL Plus Western blotting detection system (Amersham Biosciences).RNA Interference—Short interfering RNA for LCMT1 was obtained as Stealth™ RNAi from Invitrogen. The following siRNA duplexes were used for RNAi-mediated knockdown of LCMT1: LCMT1 duplex a, GGCAUGGAUACCACCUUCUGGAGAU; LCMT1 duplex b, GGACACAUACUGGAUUCAAAGAGAU; and LCMT1 duplex c, CAGUCAGCUUAUAAAGGCAUUUCUA. As a negative control, a scrambled siRNA with the following sequence was used: GGCUAGGACCAUUCCGGUCAUAGAU. HeLa cells were transfected on the day of splitting at a final siRNA concentration of 5 nm using HiPerFect (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Alternatively a more stringent RNAi approach was achieved by transfecting the cells a second time 24 h after the first transfection. Cells were then analyzed at the indicated time.Methylation of Immunoprecipitated PP2AC—Cell extracts from COS7 cells were made as described above except that the cells were lysed in 100 μl of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The HA-tagged fusion proteins were immunoprecipitated from the supernatant with 3 μg of anti-HA antibodies and 40 μl of 50% Protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and once in T/DTT (20 mm Tris/HCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.4). The beads were then incubated at 30 °C with bacterially expressed and purified human GST-tagged LCMT1 (16Longin S. Jordens J. Martens E. Stevens I. Janssens V. Rondelez E. De Baere I. Derua R.

Samples were taken after 60 min, and reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling and were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After blotting on Hybond-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences), incorporation of radioactive [3H]methyl groups was detected with a Hyperfilm-3H (Amersham Biosciences).FACS Analysis—FACS analysis was performed as described previously (28Janssens V. Jordens J. Stevens I. Van Hoof C. Martens E. De Smedt H. Engelborghs Y. Waelkens E. Goris J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 10697-10706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly 2 days after double transfection with siRNA, HeLa cells from 6-cm plates were trypsinized, seeded into 10-cm plates, and allowed to grow for 24 h before FACS analysis. If nocodazole (1 μg/ml, Sigma) was used, it was added 15 h before FACS analysis. Cells were trypsinized, centrifuged, and then incubated with 70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline overnight. The samples were analyzed with a Beckman Instruments Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (Analis), and cell cycle analysis of DNA profiles was performed using Cylchred software.RESULTSDistinct Methylation Levels of PP2AC within Different Heterotrimers: PR61/B′ and PR72/B″, but Not PR55/B, Subunits Can Form Trimers with Unmethylated PP2AC—To investigate the PP2AC methylation state in endogenous PP2A trimeric complexes, we were confronted with a lack of specific antibodies suitable for immunoprecipitation of specific trimeric holoenzymes. Therefore, we investigated the in vivo methylation level of different PP2A heterotrimers in recovered GST pulldown complexes of COS7 cells in which different GST-tagged B subunits were ectopically expressed. First we confirmed that overexpression of the different B subunits as such did not significantly alter the intracellular amounts of methylated, demethylated, or total PP2AC in COS7 (Fig. 1A) or HeLa cells (see Fig. 7A). Incubation of the GST pulldown blots with a methylation-independent anti-PP2AC antibody and an anti-PR65 antibody showed that each expressed GST-tagged B subunit bound endogenous catalytic and PR65 subunits (Fig. 1B). Moreover measuring phosphatase activity in the recovered GST pulldown complexes using phosphorylase a as a substrate demonstrated that the assembled PP2A complexes were functionally active (results not shown), suggesting that heterotrimers were formed. Probing of the blots with methylation-sensitive antibodies showed that only trimers encompassing a PR55/B subunit (PP2AT55α,β1) were nearly fully methylated, whereas trimers with a PR61/B′ (PP2AT61α,β1,δ1,ϵ) or PR72/B″ (PP2AT72,70) subunit contained a mixture of methylated and demethylated catalytic subunits (Fig. 1B). (Note that the different B subunits differ in their capacity to bind endogenous PP2AC, and therefore the amount of bound demethylated and methylated PP2AC should be compared with each other for the same B subunit.)FIGURE 7Down-regulation of LCMT1 causes a decrease in the methylation level of PR61- and PR72-containing heterotrimers. The LCMT1-specific siRNA duplex, LCMT1 duplex a (+), or a control non-silencing (-) siRNA was transfected into HeLa cells. 24 h later, the cells were transfected with plasmids expressing GST-tagged PR55α, PR61δ1, PR61ϵ, or PR72 or GST alone. 72 h after transfection with the siRNA duplexes, total cell extracts were prepared and used for GST pulldown assays. Total extracts (A) and GST pulldowns (B) were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further substantiate our findings and to prove that the GST pulldown assay is reliable and reflective of the endogenous situation, we performed immunoprecipitations of endogenous PR55α and PR61δ subunits. Fig. 1C shows that endogenous PR55 subunits only bound methylated PP2AC, whereas endogenous PR61δ subunits bound a mixture of demethylated and methylated PP2AC. Importantly these data confirm our GST pulldown assays (Fig. 1B) and show that the results from the expressed GST-tagged B subunits can be extrapolated to the proteins at the endogenous level, thereby validating our experimental approach to investigate the intrinsic, structural requirements of the PP2AC C-terminal tail for heterotrimeric assembly.Methylation Potential of Various PP2AC C-terminal Mutants—We generated different point and deletion mutants of PP2AC, all affecting the highly conserved C-terminal 304TPDYFL309 tail, and expressed them as HA-tagged proteins in COS7 cells. To determine whether these mutated HA-PP2AC subunits could still be methylated, we added bacterially expressed and purified GST-tagged LCMT1 and S-adenosyl[3H]methionine to the anti-HA immunoprecipitates. Our results show that, like wild-type PP2AC, the L309A, L309V, T304A, and T304D mutants could still be methylated by LCMT1, whereas methylation of L309Δ, Y307D and Y307F could not be detected (Fig. 2A). Therefore, the nature of the C-terminal Leu is not an absolute requirement for methylation, and the C-terminal tail contains additional determinants. Moreover all the different point and deletion mutants of PP2AC were still capable of binding the PR65 subunit when immunoprecipitated from cells (Fig. 2B), suggesting that in contrast to yeast (22Wei H. Ashby D.G. Moreno C.S. Ogris E. Yeong F.M. Corbett A.H. Pallas D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1570-1577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) methylation has little influence on PR65 binding.FIGURE 2Methylation state of various PP2AC C-terminal mutants. A, COS7 cells overexpressing HA alone, HA-tagged wild-type PP2AC, or the mutants L309A, L309V, L309Δ, Y307F, Y307D, T304A, or T304D were used to prepare anti-HA immunoprecipitates. An in vitro methylation assay was performed. The blots were subsequently incubated with anti-HA antibodies to detect the amount of immunoprecipitated HA-tagged catalytic subunits. B, HA immunoprecipitates were prepared from COS7 cells overexpressing HA alone, HA-tagged wild-type PP2AC or the mutants L309A, L309V, L309Δ, Y307F, Y307D, T304A, T304D, or T304Δ. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western blotting for the presence of endogenous PR65 and expressed HA-tagged PP2AC subunits.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Differential Impact of the Conserved PP2AC C-terminal Tail on Binding of the Regulatory Subunits—Additional evidence that PP2AT61 and PP2AT72 do not absolutely require methylated PP2AC for holoenzyme assembly came from GST pulldown experiments with these HA-tagged mutant PP2AC subunits. First we determined whether the different GST-tagged B subunits could bind wild-type HA-tagged PP2AC. To this end, one GST-tagged B-type subunit was co-expressed with HA-PP2AC in COS7 cells, and the presence of HA-PP2AC was evaluated in GST pulldowns (Fig. 3A). Detection with anti-PP2AC antibodies showed that, in addition to HA-PP2AC, endogenous PP2AC was also incorporated into the recovered GST-B subunit complexes. This suggests that breakdown of B subunits unable to bind mutated HA-PP2AC will likely be prevented in this experimental setup because these B subunits will still form heterotrimers with endogenous PP2AC (29Strack S.

In addition analysis of the proportion of endogenous/HA-tagged PP2AC pulled down by the several in vivo formed GST fusion proteins revealed that the proportion was very similar with all B-type subunits tested (Fig. 3A), thereby giving additional credit to the experimental design as a reliable method that closely follows the endogenous situation. The precipitated HA-tagged PP2AC is in the same range although somewhat lower than the endogenous un-tagged PP2AC counterpart.FIGURE 3Impact of PP2AC C-terminal deletions on the formation of different PP2A heterotrimers. COS7 cells were simultaneously transfected with GST-tagged B subunits and HA-tagged wild-type PP2AC (A), L309Δ (B), and T304Δ (C). 2 days after transfection, total cell extracts were prepared and used for GST pulldown assays. Total extracts and GST pulldowns were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. All lanes were analyzed on the same blot but were originally not adjacent (Pd, pulldown; Ex, extract).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Subsequently we determined whether HA-tagged PP2AC lacking leucine 309 (L309Δ) could still associate with the different B subunits. Our results show that all members of the PR61/B′ and PR72/B″ subunit families still strongly bound this mutant, whereas the PR55α and PR55β1 subunits hardly could (Fig. 3B). Because this mutant cannot be methylated by LCMT1 (Fig. 2A), these data corroborate our previous results (Fig. 1A), demonstrating that the PR61/B′ and PR72/B″ subunits can bind methylation-deficient PP2AC.Similarly we investigated whether and how deletion of the last six C-terminal residues of PP2AC (T304Δ) affected PP2A heterotrimer formation. Surprisingly PR61δ1, PR72, and PR70, another member of the PR72/B″ family (26Stevens I. Janssens V. Martens E. Dilworth S. Goris J. Van Hoof C. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 376-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), could still associate with this PP2AC mutant (Fig. 3C), suggesting that these B subunits do not require any contacts with the last six C-terminal residues of PP2AC. On the other hand, the inability of the PR55α,β1 and PR61α,β1,ϵ subunits to bind this T304Δ PP2AC mutant (Fig. 3C) shows that at least something in the last six C-terminal residues of PP2AC is required for the formation of these PP2A heterotrimers.Other Requirements for PP2AT55 Formation: Role of the Leu309 Side Chain—Whereas mutation of the C-terminal Leu309 residue into Val did not affect the binding of any PP2A B-type subunit (Fig. 4A), the L309A mutant specifically failed to bind the PR55/B family members (Fig. 4B). This is a surprising result because both L309A and L309V mutants could still be methylated (Fig. 2A). Therefore these data suggest that in addition to carboxyl methylation of Leu309, the nature of the C-terminal residue side chain is also important: possibly a bulky and/or hydrophobic side chain (isobutyl as in Leu or isopropyl as in Val) is equally well needed at this position to allow PP2AT55 formation. A shorter methyl side chain, as in alanine, is not sufficient for stable PP2AT55 formation.FIGURE 4Mutation of Leu309 into Val, but not Ala, permits T55 formation. COS7 cells were simultaneously transfected with GST-tagged B subunits and HA-tagged L309V PP2AC (A) and L309A (B). 2 days after transfection, total cell extracts were prepared and used for GST pulldown assays. Total extracts and GST pulldowns were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated antibodies. All lanes were analyzed on the same blot but were originally not adjacent (Pd, pulldown; Ex, extract).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Role of Tyr307 in PP2A Trimer Formation—By a similar approach we investigated whether phosphorylation-mimicking mutations of Tyr307 (Y307D) or mutation of Tyr307 into a non-phosphorylatable residue (Y307F) could affect PP2A heterotrimer assembly. Our results show that only PR61δ1, PR72, and PR70 subunits could bind these methylation-deficient mutants (Figs. 2A and 5, A and B). As for the T304Δ PP2AC mutant (Fig. 3C), the differential binding of the PR61 family members to these mutants was unexpected and again demonstrates that members of the PR61/B′ subunit family differ in their contacts with the C-terminal tail of PP2AC: PR61δ1 requires no contacts at all, and PR61α,β1,ϵ requires a specific contact with the Tyr307 residue, likely with the hydroxyl substituent on the phenyl ring. Although at first sight the PR55/B members also seem to require these contacts, this could not be unambiguously concluded from this experiment due to the fact that the Y307D and Y307F mutants are not methylated. Given our previous findings that methylation is an absolute requirement for PP2AT55 formation, this could equally well explain the lack of Y307D or Y307F binding.FIGURE 5R"
https://openalex.org/W2152293013,"Dimerization of HIV-1 protease subunits is essential for its proteolytic activity, which plays a critical role in HIV-1 replication. Hence, the inhibition of protease dimerization represents a unique target for potential intervention of HIV-1. We developed an intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based HIV-1-expression assay employing cyan and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged protease monomers. Using this assay, we identified non-peptidyl small molecule inhibitors of protease dimerization. These inhibitors, including darunavir and two experimental protease inhibitors, blocked protease dimerization at concentrations of as low as 0.01 μm and blocked HIV-1 replication with IC50 values of 0.0002-0.48 μm. These agents also inhibited the proteolytic activity of mature protease. Other approved anti-HIV-1 agents examined except tipranavir, a CCR5 inhibitor, and soluble CD4 failed to block the dimerization event. Once protease monomers dimerize to become mature protease, mature protease is not dissociated by this dimerization inhibition mechanism, suggesting that these agents block dimerization at the nascent stage of protease maturation. The proteolytic activity of mature protease that managed to undergo dimerization despite the presence of these agents is likely to be inhibited by the same agents acting as conventional protease inhibitors. Such a dual inhibition mechanism should lead to highly potent inhibition of HIV-1.

Moreover, a number of challenges have been encountered, which include various adverse effects, only partial and limited immunologic restorations achieved, and occurrence of various cancers as consequences of survival elongation with highly active antiretroviral therapy (1Simon V. Ho D.D. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2003; 1: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Moreover, such limitations of highly active antiretroviral therapy are exacerbated by the development of drug-resistant HIV-1 variants (2Carr A. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2003; 2: 624-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of new classes of antiretroviral drugs that have one or more unique mechanisms of action and produce no or minimal adverse effects remains an important therapeutic objective. human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 fluorescence resonance energy transfer cyan fluorescent protein yellow fluorescent protein brecanavir darunavir cycloheximide protease inhibitor bistetrahydrofuranylurethane tipranavir firefly luminescence Renilla luminescence reverse transcriptase protease. Dimerization of HIV-1 protease subunits is an essential process for the acquisition of proteolytic activity of HIV-1 protease, which plays a critical role in the maturation and replication of the virus (3Wlodawer A. Miller M. Jaskolski M. Sathyanarayana B.K. Baldwin E. Weber I.T. Selk L.M. Clawson L. Schneider J. Kent S.B. Science. 1989; 245: 616-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar, 4Kohl N.E.

Thus inhibition of protease dimerization by chemical reagents is likely to abolish proteolytic activity and inhibit HIV-1 replication. However, for possible development of HIV-1 protease dimerization inhibitors, better understanding of the nature and dynamics of protease dimerization is crucial. The monomer subunits are connected by polar and non-polar interactions to form the dimer. Hydrophobicity of Leu-89, Leu-90, and Ile-93 and several other residues have been considered important in the folding of a protease monomer as well as in dimer stabilization (5Lapatto R. Blundell T. Hemmings A. Overington J. Wilderspin A. Wood S. Merson J.R. Whittle P.J. Danley D.E. Geoghegan K.F. Hawrylik S.J. Lee S.E. Scheld K.G. Hobart P.M.

Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1391-1396Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). For a systematic analysis of the conserved network of hydrogen bonds, termed “fireman's grip,” Strisovsky et al. (7Strisovsky K. Tessmer U. Langner J. Konvalinka J. Krausslich H.G. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1631-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) have mutated the active site Thr-26 to a Ser, Cys, or Ala and have shown that T26A substitution reduced protease dimer stability, thus virtually nullifying the proteolytic activity of protease. Indeed, in our present study, T26A substitution effectively disrupted protease dimerization (see below), corroborating the results by Strisovsky et al. The flexibility of monomeric and dimeric HIV-1 protease and the feasibility of a stable protease monomer have also been studied by computational simulation (8Levy Y. Caflisch A. Onuchic J.N. Wolynes P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Levy Y. Caflisch A. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2003; 107: 3068-3079Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). There are four anti-parallel β-sheets involving the N and C termini of both monomer subunits and they contribute close to 75% of the dimerization energy (10Todd M.J. Semo N. Freire E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), explaining at least in part why DRV failed to dissociate mature protease dimer (see below). The termini interface has been explored as a dimerization inhibition target by several groups (11Bowman M.J. Byrne S. Chmielewski J. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 439-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 12Frutos S. Rodriguez-Mias R.A. Madurga S. Collinet B. Reboud-Ravaux M. Ludevid D. Giralt E.

Chem. 2006; 49: 4657-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We have also recently reported that certain peptides containing the dimer interface sequences amino acids 1-5 and amino acids 95-99 blocked HIV-1 infectivity and replication (14Davis D.A. Brown C.A. Singer K.E. Wang V. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P. Maeda K. Harada S. Yoshimura K. Kosalaraksa P. Mitsuya H. Yarchoan R. Antiviral Res. 2006; 72: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge, no evidence of direct dimerization inhibition by such compounds has been yet documented. In the present study, we developed an intermolecular fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based HIV-1-expression assay that employed cyan and yellow fluorescent protein-tagged HIV-1 protease monomers. Using this assay, we identified a group of non-peptidyl small molecule inhibitors of HIV-1 protease dimerization. These inhibitors, including the recently approved protease inhibitor (PI) darunavir (DRV) as well as two experimental protease inhibitors (PIs), blocked protease dimerization at concentrations of as low as 0.01 μm and blocked HIV-1 replication in vitro with IC50 values of 0.0002-0.48 μm. These agents also inhibited the proteolytic activity of mature HIV-1 protease. Another PI, tipranavir (TPV), active against HIV-1 variants resistant to multiple PIs, also blocked protease dimerization, although all other existing FDA-approved anti-HIV-1 drugs examined in the present study failed to block the dimerization. The present report represents the first demonstration that non-peptidic small molecule agents can disrupt protease dimerization. Generation of FRET-based HIV-1 Expression System—Cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)- and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged HIV-1 protease constructs were generated using BD Creator™ DNA cloning kits (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). First, XhoI/HindIII fragments from pCR-XL-TOPO vector containing the HIV-1 protease-encoding gene excised from pHIV-1NL4-3 was inserted into the pDNR-1r (donor vector) that had been digested with XhoI and HindIII. In the transfer of the protease gene from the donor vector into pLP-CFP/YFP-C1 (acceptor vector), the Cre-loxP site-specific recombination method was used according to manufacturer's instructions. Using Cre-recombinase with the lox P site, the protease gene from pDNR-1r was inserted into pLP-CFP-C1 or pLP-YFP-C1 through Cre-mediated recombination (15Hoess R.H. Abremski K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1026-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), generating a plasmid of CFP-tagged wild type protease (PRWT) and that of YFP-tagged PRWT, with which HIV-1 protease was successfully expressed as a fusion protein with CFP- and YFP-tagged at the C terminus, respectively. Western blot assay using anti-green fluorescent protein-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies revealed that protease was correctly tagged to CFP or YFP (data not shown). For the generation of full-length molecular infectious clones containing CFP- or YFP-tagged protease, the PCR-mediated recombination method was used (16Fang G. Weiser B. Visosky A. Moran T. Burger H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To this end, we amplified an upstream proviral DNA fragment containing ApaI site and HIV-1 protease (excised from pHIV-1NL4-3) with a primer pair: Apa-PRO-F (5′-TTG CAG GGC CCC TAG GAA AAA GG-3′) plus PR-5Ala-R (5′-GGC TGC TGC GGC AGC AAA ATT TAA AGT GCA GCC AAT CT-3′), a middle proviral DNA fragment containing CFP (excised from pCFP-C1) or YFP (excised from pYFP-C1) (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) with a primer pair: CFPYFP-5Ala-F (5′-GCT GCC GCA GCA GCC GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG GAG CTG-3′) plus CFPYFP-FP-R (5′-ACT AAT GGG AAA CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT GCC G-3′), and a downstream proviral DNA fragment containing the 5′-DNA fragment of reverse transcriptase (RT) and SmaI site from pHIV-1NLSma (17Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K. Kavlick M.F. Nagashima K. Gorelick R.J. Mardy S. Tang C. Summers M.F. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5952-5961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), which had been created to have a SmaI site by changing two nucleotides (2590 and 2593) of pHIV-1NL4-3 with a primer pair: FRT-F (5′-TTT CCC ATT AGT CCT ATT GAG ACT GTA-3′) plus NL4-3-RT263-R (5′-CCA GAA ATC TTG AGT TCT CTT ATT-3′). A linker consisting of five alanines was inserted between protease and fluorescent protein. The phenylalanine-proline site that HIV-1 protease cleaves was also introduced between the fluorescent protein and RT. Thus obtained three DNA fragments were subsequently joined by using the PMR reaction performed under the standard condition for ExTaq polymerase (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan) with 10 pmol of Apa-PRO-F (5′-TTG CAG GGC CCC TAG GAA AAA GG-3′) and NL4-3-RT263-R (5′-CCA GAA ATC TTG AGT TCT CTT ATT-3′) and the three DNA fragments (100 ng each) in a 20-μl reaction solution. Thermal cycling was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 50 s, 53 °C for 50 s, and 72 °C for 2 min, and finally by 72 °C for 15 min. The amplified PCR products were cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO vector according to the manufacturer's instructions (Gateway Cloning System, Invitrogen). PCR products were generated with pCR-XL-TOPO vector as templates, followed by digestion by both ApaI and SmaI, and the ApaI-SmaI fragment was introduced into pHIV-1NLSma (17Gatanaga H. Suzuki Y. Tsang H. Yoshimura K. Kavlick M.F. Nagashima K. Gorelick R.J. Mardy S. Tang C. Summers M.F. Mitsuya H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5952-5961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), generating pHIV-PRWTCFP and pHIV-PRWTYFP respectively. Analysis of Inter- and Intra-molecule Interactions of Protease Subunits—Analysis of inter- and intra-molecule interactions of protease subunits was conducted by employing the crystal structure of DRV with HIV-1 protease (PDB ID: 2IEN). Hydrogens were added and minimized using the OPLS2005 force field with constraints on heavy atom positions. The calculation was performed using MacroModel 9.1 from Schrödinger, LLC. Hydrogen bonds were assigned when the following distance and angle cut-off was satisfied: 3.0 Å for H-A distance; D-H-A angle >90°; and H-A-B angle >60° where H is the hydrogen, A is the acceptor, D is the donor, and B is a neighbor atom bonded to the acceptor. The representative distance between the termini of two monomers was determined by analyzing the protease-DRV crystal structure (PDB ID: 2IEN). The distance between the α carbons at the N termini and C termini is around 0.5 nm, whereas the distance between the α carbons of the N termini ends of two monomers is around 1.8 nm. FRET Procedure—COS7 cells plated on EZ view cover-glass bottom culture plate (Iwaki, Tokyo) were transfected with the indicated plasmid constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions in the presence of various concentrations of each compound, cultured for 72 h, and analyzed under Fluoview FV500 confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Optical Corp., Tokyo) at room temperature. When the effect of each compound was analyzed by FRET, test compounds were added to the culture medium simultaneously with plasmid transfection. The results of FRET were determined by quenching of CFP (donor) fluorescence and an increase in YFP (acceptor) fluorescence (sensitized emission), because part of the energy of CFP is transferred to YFP instead of being emitted. This phenomenon can be measured by bleaching YFP, which should result in an increase in CFP fluorescence. This technique, also known as acceptor photobleaching, is a well established method of determining the occurrence of FRET (18Sekar R.B. Periasamy A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar, 19Bastiaens P.I. Majoul I.V. Verveer P.J. Soling H.D. Jovin T.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 31269-31276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Dequenching of the donor CFP by selective photobleaching of the acceptor YFP was performed by first obtaining YFP and CFP images at the same focal plane, followed by illuminating for 3 min the same image at a wavelength of 488 nm with a laser power set at the maximum intensity to bleach YFP and re-capturing the same CFP and YFP images. The changes in the CFP and YFP fluorescence intensity in the images of selected regions were examined and quantified using Olympus FV500 Image software system (Olympus Optical Corp.). Background values were obtained from the regions where no cells were present and were subtracted from the values for the cells examined in all calculations. For each chimeric protein, the data were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Digitized image data obtained from the experiment were prepared for presentation using Photoshop 6.0 (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA). Ratios of intensities of CFP fluorescence after photobleaching to CFP fluorescence prior to photobleaching (CFPA/B ratios) were determined. It is well established that the CFPA/B ratios of >1.0 indicate that association of CFP- and YFP-tagged proteins occurred, and it was interpreted that the dimerization of protease subunits occurred. When the CFPA/B ratios were <1, it indicated that the association of the two subunits did not occur, and it was interpreted that protease dimerization was inhibited. Non-peptidyl Small Molecule Compounds—Seven non-peptidyl small molecule compounds were synthesized in a convergent manner by coupling an optically active P2 ligand and an (R)-hydroxyethylamino sulfonamide isostere (22Ghosh A.K. Pretzer E. Cho H. Hussain K.A. Duzgunes N. Antiviral. Res. 2002; 54: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Synthetic methods for TMC126 and DRV have been previously described (22Ghosh A.K. Pretzer E. Cho H. Hussain K.A. Duzgunes N. Antiviral. Res. 2002; 54: 29-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 23Ghosh A.K. Leshchenko S. Noetzel M. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 7822-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Detailed synthetic methods for the other four compounds will be described elsewhere. TPV was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. Dual Luciferase Assay—Dual luciferase assay was established using the CheckMate™ Mammalian Two-Hybrid System (Promega Corp., Madison, WI). Briefly, BamHI/KpnI fragments from pCR-XL-TOPO vector containing the HIV-1 protease (PRWT)-encoding gene excised from pHIV-1NL4-3 was inserted into the pACT vector and pBIND vector that had been digested with BamHI and KpnI, generating pACT-PRwt and pBIND-PRwt, which produced an in-frame fusion of wild-type HIV-1 protease downstream of the VP16 activation domain and GAL4 DNA-binding domain, respectively. COS7 cells were co-transfected with pACT-PRwt, pBIND-PRwt, and pG5luc in the absence or presence of 0.1 or 1.0 μm DRV in white 96-well flat bottom plates (Corning, NY), cultured for 48 h, and the intensity of firefly luminescence (Fluc) and Renilla luminescence (Rluc) was measured with TR717 microplate luminometer (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DRV was added to the culture medium simultaneously with plasmids to be used. Fluc/Rluc intensity ratios were determined with co-transfection of pACT-PRWT, pBIND-PRWT, and pG5luc in the absence of DRV, serving as maximal values. Fluc/Rluc intensity ratios determined with co-transfection of a pACT vector, a pBIND vector, and pG5luc served as minimal (background) values. Relative response ratios (RRR) were determined using the following formula: RRR = [(experimental Fluc/Rluc) - (negative control Fluc/Rluc)]/[(positive control Fluc/Rluc) - (negative control Fluc/Rluc)]. Drug Susceptibility Assay—The susceptibility of HIV-1LAI to various drugs and their cytotoxicity were determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay as previously described (24Koh Y. Nakata H. Maeda K. Ogata H. Bilcer G. Devasamudram T. Kincaid J.F. Boross P. Wang Y.F. Tie Y. Volarath P. Gaddis L. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Ghosh A.K. Mitsuya H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3123-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Briefly, MT-2 cells (2 × 104/ml) were exposed to 100 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50s) of HIV-1LAI in the presence or absence of various concentrations of drugs in 96-well microculture plates and cultured at 37 °C for 7 days. After 100 μl of the medium was removed from each well, 3-(4,5-dimetylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (10 μl, 7.5 mg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was added to each well, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 4 h. After incubation, 100 μl of acidified isopropanol containing 4% (v/v) Triton X-100 was added to each well, to dissolve the formazan crystals, and the optical density was measured in a kinetic microplate reader (Vmax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). All assays were performed in duplicate or triplicate. In some experiments, MT-2 cells were chosen as target cells in the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, because these cells undergo greater HIV-1-elicited cytopathic effects than MT-4 cells. Enzyme Kinetics—The chromogenic substrate Lys-Ala-Arg-Val-Nle-paranitro-Phe-Glu-Ala-Nle-amide (Sigma) was used to determine the kinetic parameters (25Kovalevsky A.Y. Liu F. Leshchenko S. Ghosh A.K. Louis J.M. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 161-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Ghosh A.K. Sridhar P.R. Leshchenko S. Hussain A.K. Li J. Kovalevsky A.Y.

Wild-type protease, at final concentrations of 160-190 nm, was added to varying concentrations of substrate (100-400 μm) maintained in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and assayed by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 310 nm using a Varian Cary 100Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer. The kcat and Km values were obtained employing standard data fitting techniques for a reaction obeying Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The data curves were fitted using SigmaPlot 8.0.2 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The active enzyme concentrations were calculated from the intercept of the linear fit to the IC50 versus [S] plots with the IC50 axis. The Ki values were obtained from the IC50 values estimated from an inhibitor dose-response curve with the spectroscopic assay using the equation Ki = (IC50 - [E]/2)/(1 + [S]/Km), where [E] and [S] are the protease and substrate concentrations, respectively (27Maibaum J.

The measurement was repeated at least three times to produce the average values. Assay for Effects of Darunavir on Dimerized Mature Protease—To examine whether a representative dimerization inhibitor, DRV, could dissociate mature protease that had already been dimerized, COS7 cells were co-transfected with a pair of plasmids encoding HIV-PRWTCFP and HIV-PRWTYFP and exposed to a protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX, 50 μg/ml, Sigma) at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of culture following transfection. The cells were then exposed to DRV (1 μm) on day 5 of culture, and the values of the CFPA/B ratio were determined at various time points. When the CFPA/B ratios determined were >1.0, it was determined that HIV-1 protease had been generated and dimerization had occurred. The production of HIV-1 was monitored every 24 h following transfection by determining levels of p24 Gag protein produced into culture medium as previously described (24Koh Y. Nakata H. Maeda K. Ogata H. Bilcer G. Devasamudram T. Kincaid J.F. Boross P. Wang Y.F. Tie Y. Volarath P. Gaddis L. Harrison R.W. Weber I.T. Ghosh A.K. Mitsuya H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2003; 47: 3123-3129Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Generation of FRET-based HIV-1 Expression Assay—The basic concepts of the intermolecular FRET-based HIV-1-expression assay (FRET-HIV-1 assay) are shown in Fig. 1. Within a plasmid (pHIV-1NL4-3), which encodes a full-length molecular infectious HIV-1 clone, the gene encoding a CFP was attached to the downstream end (C terminus) of the gene encoding an HIV-1 protease subunit through the flexible linker added (five alanines), generating pHIV-1NL4-3/CFP (Fig. 1A). Within the other plasmid (pHIV-1NL4-3), the gene encoding a YFP was attached to the downstream end of protease-encoding gene in the same manner, generating pHIV-1NL4-3/YFP. Both CFP and YFP were designed to have phenylalanine and proline in the connection with RT so that the protease is cleaved from RT when two subunits dimerize and the dimerized protease acquires enzymatic activity. Fig. 1B illustrates that HIV-1 virions generated in COS7 cells transfected with pHIV-1NL4-3/CFP contained CFP-tagged protease and those in COS7 cells transfected with pHIV-1NL4-3/YFP contained YFP-tagged protease as examined in Western blotting. The HIV-1 virions produced were capable of infecting CD4+ MT-4 cells when the cells were exposed to the supernatant of the transfected COS7 cells (data not shown), indicating that the expressed tagged protease was enzymatically and virologically functional. In the cytoplasm of COS7 cells co-transfected with pHIV-1NL4-3/CFP and pHIV-1NL4-3/YFP, a CFP-tagged protease subunit interacts and dimerizes with a YFP-tagged protease subunit, and CFP and YFP get close because the termini are separated by only 0.5 to 1.8 nm in the dimeric form of protease (note: the representative distance was determined by analyzing the protease-DRV crystal structure (PDB ID: 2IEN)). A focused laser beam excitation of CFP (triggered by helium-cadmium laser) results in rapid energy transfer to YFP, and most of the fluorescence photons are emitted by YFP (28Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2620) Google Scholar). If the dimerization is blocked, the average distance between CFP and YFP become larger, the energy transfer rate is decreased, and the fraction of photons emitted by YFP is lowered. To help us interpret the energy transfer efficiency quantitatively, we used the acceptor photobleaching technique, in which the change in CFP emission quenching is measured by comparing the value before and after selectively photobleaching YFP, which prevents problems associated with variable expression levels. In this acceptor photobleaching approach, when FRET occurs, the fluorescence of the CFP donor increases after bleaching the YFP acceptor chromophore, which is recognized as a signature for FRET (18Sekar R.B. Periasamy A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Thus, the analysis of the change in CFP fluorescence intensity in the same specimen regions, before and after removal of the acceptor, directly relates the energy transfer efficiency to both donor and acceptor fluorescence. Fig. 1C illustrates representative images of co-transfected cells prior to and after YFP photobleaching, showing that, following photobleaching, YFP fluorescence of YFP-tagged wild-type protease subunit (PRWT YFP) was decreased, whereas CFP fluorescence of PR WTCFP increased. To further help us evaluate the energy transfer efficiency, we determined the ratios of cyan fluorescence intensity, determined with a confocal laser scanning microscope, after photobleaching over that before photobleaching (hereafter referred to as CFPA/B ratios). We also determined YFPA/B ratios in the same manner. If the CFPA/B ratios are >1.0, it is thought the energy transfer (or FRET) took place (18Sekar R.B. Periasamy A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), signifying that dimerization of PR WTCFP and PRWTYFP subunits occurred. Fig. 1D shows that in the co-transfected COS7 cells (n = 23), the CFPA/B ratios were all >1.0 (CFPA/B ratios, 1.24 ± 0.11; YFPA/B ratios, 0.47 ± 0.09), demonstrating that dimerization of protease subunits occurred. Changes in Fluorescence Emission with Amino Acid Substitutions in Protease—First, it was determined whether the above-described FRET-HIV-1 assay could be used to detect the disruption of HIV-1 protease dimerization. Five amino acids at the N terminus and those at the C terminus have been shown to be critical for protease dimerization (29Babe L.M. Rose J. Craik C.S. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1244-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A, two protease monomer subunits are connected by four antiparallel β-sheets involving the N and C termini of both subunits. It is of note that mature dimerized protease has as many as 12 hydrogen bonds in this N- and C-terminal region. Thus, we introduced a Pro-1 to Ala substitution (P1A), Q2A, I3A, T4A, L5A, T96A, L97A, N98A, or F99A substitution into the replication-competent HIV-1NL4-3 and found that I3A, L5A, T96A, L97A, and F99A disrupted protease dimerization, although other substitutions did not disrupt the dimerization. Several amino acid substitutions outside the N and C termini have also been known to play a role in HIV-1 protease dimerization. Ishima and Louis and their colleagues have demonstrated that the introduction of T26A, D29N, D29A, or R87K to HIV-1 protease disrupts the dimer interface contacts and destabilizes protease dimer, c"

Glutamate, proline, and ectoine were the dominant compatible solutes synthesized by the various Bacillus species. The majority of the inspected Bacilli produced the tetrahydropyrimidine ectoine in response to high salinity stress, and a subset of these also synthesized a hydroxylation derivative of ectoine, 5-hydroxyectoine. In Salibacillus salexigens, a representative of the ectoine- and 5-hydroxyectoine-producing species, ectoine production was linearly correlated with the salinity of the growth medium and dependent on an ectABC biosynthetic operon. The formation of 5-hydroxyectoine was primarily a stationary growth phase phenomenon. The enzyme responsible for ectoine hydroxylation (EctD) was purified from S. salexigens to apparent homogeneity. The EctD protein was shown in vitro to directly hydroxylate ectoine in a reaction dependent on iron(II), molecular oxygen, and 2-oxoglutarate. We identified the structural gene (ectD) for the ectoine hydroxylase in S. salexigens. Northern blot analysis showed that the transcript levels of the ectABC and ectD genes increased as a function of salinity. Many EctD-related proteins can be found in data base searches in various Bacteria. Each of these bacterial species also contains an ectABC ectoine biosynthetic gene cluster, suggesting that 5-hydroxyectoine biosynthesis strictly depends on the prior synthesis of ectoine. Our data base searches and the biochemical characterization of the EctD protein from S. salexigens suggest that the EctD-related ectoine hydroxylases are members of a new subfamily within the non-heme-containing, iron(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase superfamily (EC 1.14.11).

Important examples of compatible solutes within the domain of the Bacteria are the imino acid proline, the disaccharide trehalose, the trimethylammonium compound glycine betaine, and the tetrahydropyrimidine ectoine (4Galinski E.A.

Ectoine ((S)-2-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid) (Fig. 1) was originally found as a compatible solute in the extremely halophilic phototrophic purple sulfur bacterium Ectothiorhodospira halochloris (12Galinski E.A. Kim H.P. Truper H.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 149: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Its discovery was soon followed by the description of its hydroxylated derivative, 5-hydroxyectoine ((S,S)-2-methyl-5-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid) (Fig. 1) in the Gram-positive soil bacterium Streptomyces parvulus (13Inbar L.

Molecular analysis of the ectoine biosynthetic genes in various Gram-negative and Gram-positive Bacteria has shown that the ectoine biosynthetic enzymes are encoded by an evolutionarily conserved gene cluster, ectABC (14Kuhlmann A.U.

The ectoine biosynthetic enzymes (EctABC) from H. elongata have been purified and characterized biochemically (21Ono H. Kim K. Khunajakr N. Tao T. Yamamoto M. Hiramoto M. Shinmyo A. Takano M. Murooka Y. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 91-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to synthesize ectoine is widespread within the domain of the Bacteria (15Reshetnikov A.S. Kim V.N. Trotsenko Y.A. Arch. Microbiol. 2006; 184: 286-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), but only a subset of the ectoine producers also synthesizes the hydroxylation derivative, 5-hydroxyectoine (4Galinski E.A.

Like ectoine, 5-hydroxyectoine serves as a compatible solute in vivo, functions as an osmoprotectant, and exhibits protein stabilizing properties in vitro (22Manzanera M. Kim A. Tondervik A.

The ability of a given microorganism to synthesize 5-hydroxyectoine invariably depends on its ability to produce ectoine, suggesting that 5-hydroxyectoine formation occurs either directly from ectoine (26Prabhu J.

The most straightforward route to produce 5-hydroxyectoine would be the direct hydroxylation of ectoine via a substrate-specific hydroxylase (Fig. 1). Here we report the biochemical characterization of such an enzyme from the moderate halophile Salibacillus salexigens. Chemicals—Ectoine ((S)-2-methyl-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid) and 5-hydroxyectoine (S,S)-2-methyl-5-hydroxy-1,4,5,6-tetrahydropyrimidine-4-carboxylic acid) were purchased from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). l-Proline, 3-hydroxy-dl-proline, and 4-hydroxy-l-proline were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Two synthetic ectoine derivatives, homoectoine ((S)-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2-methyl-1H-(1, 3)-diazepine-4-carboxylic acid) (28Schnoor M. Kim P. Cullen P. Boking T. Galla H.J. Galinski E.A. Lorkowski S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and DHMICA ((RS)-4,5-dihydro-2-methyl-imidazole-4-carboxylic acid) were kindly provided by E. A. Galinski (University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany). Anhydrotetracycline hydrochloride and d-desthiobiotin were purchased from IBA (Göttingen, Germany). High Pressure Liquid Chromatography Analysis of Ectoine and 5-Hydroxyectoine from Cell Extracts—Cultures (80 ml) of S. salexigens (DSM 11483T) were grown in a shaking water bath (220 rpm) in mineral salt-based medium (29Garabito M.J. Kim D.R. Mellado E. Marquez M.C. Ventosa A. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (for details, see supplemental material) with the indicated NaCl concentrations until the cultures reached an A578 of approximately 1. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (10 min; 4 °C; 2800 × g) and lyophilized, the dry weight of the cells was determined, and the cells were then extracted using a modified Bligh and Dyer technique (30Kunte H.J. Kim E.A. Trüper H.G. J. Microbiol. Methods. 1993; 17: 129-136Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine content of the cells was measured by HPLC 2The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; TES, N-tris(hydroxymethyl)methyl-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid. analysis using a GROM-SIL 100 Amino-1PR, 125 mm by 4 mm (3 μm) column (GROM, Rottenburg-Hailfingen, Germany) as described by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14Kuhlmann A.U. Kim E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 772-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Quantification of ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine was performed with the ChromStar 6 software (SCPA, Stuhr, Germany) using commercially available ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine as reference standards. Enzyme Assay—Ectoine hydroxylase activity in cell extracts of S. salexigens and after purification of the EctD protein was assayed by measuring the conversion from ectoine to 5-hydroxyectoine by HPLC analysis. One unit of ectoine hydroxylase activity is defined as the conversion of 1 μmol of ectoine to 1 μmol of 5-hydroxyectoine permin. During EctD purification, ectoine hydroxylase activity was assayed in a 30-μl reaction mixture that contained 10 mm TES buffer, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-oxoglutarate, 6 mm (S)-ectoine, 1 mm FeSO4·7H2O, 1.3 kilounits beef liver catalase (Roche Applied Science) and maximally 20 μl of the various protein fractions. Each reaction mixture was incubated at 32 °C for 20 min in a thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) with vigorous shaking to efficiently aerate the reaction mixture because EctD is an O2-dependent enzyme. The ectoine hydroxylase reaction was stopped by adding 30 μl of 100% acetonitrile (J. T. Baker, Deventer, The Netherlands) to the reaction mixture and subsequent immediate centrifugation (10 min, 4 °C; 32000 × g). Twenty microliters of the supernatant of these reaction mixtures were than loaded onto a GROM-SIL 100 Amino-1PR column (125 mm by 4 mm; 3-μm particle size (GROM, Rottenburg-Hailfingen, Germany), and ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine were monitored by their absorbance at 210 nm by using a UV-visible detector (LINEAR UVIS 205; SYKAM, Fürstenfeldbruck, Germany). The solute employed for ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine separation was 80% (v/v) acetonitrile. Chromatography was carried out isocratically at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 20 °C (14Kuhlmann A.U. Kim E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 772-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The retention times of ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine were determined by using commercially available ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine samples. After purification of the ectoine hydroxylase, the properties of the purified enzyme were determined by using the assay conditions described above with 2 milliunits of the purified enzyme. 5-Hydroxyectoine was produced from ectoine linearly under these conditions for up to 10 min. Kinetic parameters were calculated from velocity data of up to 5-min reactions at various substrate concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 20 mm for (S)-ectoine and from 0.1 to 15 mm for 2-oxoglutarate. Accession Numbers—The DNA sequence of the ectABC and ectD regions from S. salexigens were deposited in GenBank™ under accession numbers AY935521 and AY935522, respectively. De Novo Synthesis of Compatible Solutes within the Genus Bacillus and Closely Related Taxa—We used natural abundance 13C NMR (14Kuhlmann A.U. Kim E. Appl. Environ.

For these experiments, the various microorganisms were grown in chemically defined minimal media lacking components of rich media (e.g. yeast extract and peptone), thereby avoiding the accumulation of preformed osmoprotectants (e.g. glycine betaine and proline) from exogenous sources through transport processes by the microbial cells (35Dulaney E.L. Kim D.D. Rickes E.L. Dev. Ind. Microbiol. 1968; 9: 260-269Google Scholar). For each of the 13 different Bacilli analyzed, we evaluated the spectrum of compatible solutes synthesized in high salinity cultures grown either to mid-exponential or to stationary growth phase. We then compared these data with results from 13C NMR experiments conducted with cultures grown in the absence of high concentrations of NaCl. In each of the osmotically nonstressed cultures, we detected primarily resonances corresponding to glutamate, fully consistent with previous reports that this amino acid constitutes the dominant amino acid in the cytoplasmic organic solute pools of Bacillus subtilis (34Whatmore A.M. Kim J.A. Reed R.H. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1990; 136: 2527-2535Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) and Sporosarcina pasteurii (14Kuhlmann A.U. Kim E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 772-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Because the salinity of the growth medium was raised with NaCl, resonances of proline, ectoine, and 5-hydroxyectoine were detected in addition to those of glutamate. Resonances corresponding to 5-hydroxyectoine were found only in cultures grown at high salinity to stationary phase. The data from these 13C NMR experiments are summarized in Table 1, where they are compiled together with the data of a previous study conducted by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14Kuhlmann A.U. Kim E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 772-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) on the synthesis of compatible solutes produced in 13 additional osmotically stressed Bacilli. Hence, data on the de novo compatible solute synthesis in 26 different Bacilli are now available (Table 1), thereby providing a solid overview of the dominant compatible solutes synthesized within the genus Bacillus and closely related species.TABLE 113C NMR determination of the organic osmolytes synthesized by Bacilli strains and strains from related generaStrainDSM numberMedium (NaCl molarity)GlutamateProlineEctoineHydroxyectoineOthersAneurinibacillus aneurinilyticusaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).DSM 5562TSMM (0.5 m)+---Bacillus cereusaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).DSM 31TSMM (0.5 m)+---Bacillus circulansaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).DSM 11TSMM (0.5 m)+---Bacillus thuringiensisaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).DSM 2046TSMM (0.5 m)+---Sporosarcina globisporaDSM 4TSMM (0.2 m)+---Paenibacillus polymyxaaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).DSM 36TSMM (0.5 m)+---trehaloseBacillus amyloliquefaciensFZB 42SMM (1.0 m)++--Bacillus licheniformisaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).DSM 13TSMM (1.0 m)++--Bacillus megateriumaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).DSM 32TSMM (1.0 m)++--B. subtilisaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).JH642SMM (1.0 m)++--Bacillus vallismortisDSM 11031TSMM (1.8 m)++--Bacillus agaradhaerensDSM 8721TSMM (1.3 m)+-+-β-glutamateBacillus alcalophilusaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).DSM 485TSMM (1.0 m)+-+-Bacillus haloduransDSM 497TSMM (1.6 m)+-+-β-glutamateBacillus pseudalcaliphilusDSM 8725TSMM (1.0 m)+-+-Sporosarcina psychrophilaaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).DSM 3TSMM (1.0 m)+-+-Sporosarcina pasteuriiaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).,bS. pasteurii was grown in SMM supplemented with 2% urea.DSM 33TSMM (1.0 m)+-+-Bacillus clarkiiDSM 8720TSMM (1.8 m)+-++β-glutamateGracilibacillus halotoleransDSM 11805TSMM (2.0 m)+-++Salibacillus marismortuiDSM 12325TSMM (1.8 m)+-++Salibacillus salexigensaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).,cS. salexigens was grown in a mineral salt-based medium (MM) supplemented with glucose, casamino acids, and vitamins.DSM 11483TMM (3.4 m)+-++Bacillus mojavensisDSM 9205TSMM (1.5 m)+++-Bacillus pseudofirmusDSM 8715TSMM (1.6 m)+++-alanineHalobacillus halophilusdH. halophilus and H. trueperi were grown in a minimal medium with glucose as source of carbon and energy and supplemented with trace elements, vitamins, and amino acids.DSM 2266T802a (2.0 m)+++-N-ϵ-acetyl lysineHalobacillus trueperidH. halophilus and H. trueperi were grown in a minimal medium with glucose as source of carbon and energy and supplemented with trace elements, vitamins, and amino acids.DSM 10404T802a (2.5 m)+++-N-ϵ-acetyl lysineVirgibacillus pantothenticusaCompatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14).DSM 26TSMM (1.0 m)+++-a Compatible solute production of these strains were published by Kuhlmann and Bremer (14Kuhlmann A.U.

Open table in a new tab The evaluation of the pattern of compatible solute synthesis under high salinity growth conditions by these 26 Bacilli (Table 1) revealed the existence of three major groups: (i) species that produce only glutamate (6 of 26); (ii) species that produce glutamate and proline (5 of 26); and (iii) the majority (15 of 26) of the investigated species, which produced glutamate and ectoine. Hence, the ability to synthesize the compatible solute ectoine in response to high salinity stress is widespread within the genus Bacillus and closely related taxa. The 15 ectoine producers can be further subgrouped into three different classes: (i) those species that produce ectoine alone (6 of 15); (ii) those species that produce ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine (4 of 15); and (iii) those species that produce both ectoine and proline (5 of 15). Osmoregulatory ectoine production is therefore a widespread trait within the genus Bacillus and taxonomically closely related species. Finely Tuned and Osmotically Controlled Ectoine and 5-Hydroxyectoine Biosynthesis in S. salexigens—The main focus of this work is the elucidation of 5-hydroxyectoine formation in osmotically stressed Bacilli. We therefore chose S. salexigens as a representative of the four ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine producers discovered thus far within in the Bacilli (Table 1). S. salexigens (29Garabito M.J. Kim D.R. Mellado E. Marquez M.C. Ventosa A. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1997; 47: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) is a moderate halophile and soil bacterium that can grow over a wide range of salinities (between 0.1 and 3.4 m NaCl). This species has recently been reclassified, and the new name Virgibacillus salexigens has been suggested (36Heyrman J. Kim N.A. Busse H.J. Balcaen A. Lebbe L. Rodriguez-Diaz M. Swings J. De Vos P. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2003; 53: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To analyze the correlation between the salinity of the growth medium and the level of ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine production in S. salexigens, we grew this strain in minimal media of different salinities (0.1–2.0 m NaCl). We then quantitated the produced ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine by HPLC analysis when the cultures had reached approximately the same optical density (A578 =∼1). We found an essentially linear relationship between the ectoine content of the cells and the salinity of the growth medium over a wide range of osmotic conditions in these exponentially growing S. salexigens cultures (Fig. 2A). It is thus apparent that the cells sensitively adjust their ectoine content to the prevalent salinity of the growth medium to maintain a physiological appropriate level of cell water and consequently turgor. Although the exponentially growing cultures of S. salexigens contained a considerable amount of ectoine when the cells were stressed with various concentrations of NaCl, we found that the amount of 5-hydroxyectoine was negligible in these cultures (Fig. 2A). Our 13C NMR experiments with S. salexigens revealed that 5-hydroxyectoine production in osmotically challenged cells occurred primarily when the cultures entered the stationary growth phase. To investigate this in greater detail, we grew S. salexigens in a minimal medium with 3.2 m NaCl and monitored ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine production along the growth curve of the culture by HPLC analysis. Increased ectoine biosynthesis occurred as soon as the cells started to grow in this high osmolality medium, but there was no immediate 5-hydroxyectoine production. Appreciable amounts of 5-hydroxyectoine were made only when cell growth slowed and the culture entered stationary growth phase. Production of this compatible solute reached its maximum when the cells had stopped their growth (Fig. 2B). In these stationary growth phase cultures, we always found a mixture of both ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine (Fig. 2B), indicating that the cell converted only part of the de novo synthesized ectoine into the hydroxylation product. We examined a second ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine producer, Bacillus clarkii (Table 1), for the pattern of ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine synthesis in osmotically challenged exponential phase and stationary phase cultures. B. clarkii showed the same pattern of ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine production as that described in Fig. 2 for S. salexigens. 3N. Pica and E. Bremer, unpublished results. The other two 5-hydroxyectoine producers, Gracilibacillus halotolerans and Salibacillus marismortui, were not investigated for the pattern of ectoine and 5-hydroxyectoine production. Purification and Characterization of the Ectoine Hydroxylase—We took a biochemical approach to characterize the ectoine hydroxylase from S. salexigens. Kuhlmann and Bremer (14Kuhlmann A.U. Kim E.

We developed an enzymatic assay for ectoine hydroxylase activity that used assay conditions similar to those employed for the biochemically characterized l-proline 4-hydroxylase from Dactylosporangium sp. strain RH1 (38Shibasaki T.

Because the extent of agonist-induced activation of SPHK is modest, signaling via SPHK may be regulated through its localization at specific intracellular sites. Although the SPHK1 isoform has been extensively studied and characterized, the regulation of expression and function of the other isoform, SPHK2, remain largely unexplored. Here we describe an important post-translational modification, namely, phosphorylation of SPHK2 catalyzed by protein kinase D (PKD), which regulates its localization. Upon stimulation of HeLa cells by tumor promoter phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a serine residue in a novel and putative nuclear export signal, identified for the first time, in SPHK2 was phosphorylated followed by SPHK2 export from the nucleus. Constitutively active PKD phosphorylated this serine residue in the nuclear export signal both in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, down-regulation of PKDs through RNA interference resulted in the attenuation of both basal and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced phosphorylation, which was followed by the accumulation of SPHK2 in the nucleus in a manner rescued by PKD over-expression. These results indicate that PKD is a physiologically relevant enzyme for SPHK2 phosphorylation, which leads to its nuclear export for subsequent cellular signaling.

Although highly similar in amino acid sequence and possessing five evolutionarily conserved domains found in all SPHKs (17Liu H. Chakravarty D. Maceyka M. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 71: 493-511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SPHK2 diverges in its N terminus and central regions. These two isoforms have different kinetic properties and differ in developmental and tissue expression (5Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) implying that they may have distinct physiological functions. In fact, studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that, in contrast to cytosolic distribution of SPHK1, SPHK2 enters nuclei and inhibits DNA synthesis or induces apoptosis under stressful conditions such as serum deprivation (18Igarashi N.

Similarly, Liu et al. have reported that SPHK2 induces apoptosis through its putative BH3 domain (20Liu H. Toman R.E. Goparaju S.K. Maceyka M. Nava V.E. Sankala H. Payne S.G. Bektas M. Ishii I.

More recently, SPHK2 has been shown to phosphorylate an immunosuppressant drug FTY720 (21Billich A. Bornancin F. Devay P. Mechtcheriakova D. Urtz N. Baumruker T. J. Biol.

Magami Y. Yamamoto K. Fujiwara H. Mizuguchi J. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1352-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential immunomodulatory action. However, the physiological role of SPHK2 remains largely unknown. Nucleo/cytoplasmic shuttling of protein and RNA molecules plays an important role in eukaryotic cell function (24Weis K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 185-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). A related family of shuttling transport factors, importins and exportins, recognize nuclear localization signal (NLS)-containing or nuclear export signal (NES)-containing proteins. The coordination of trafficking between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is determined by the balance of nuclear import and export activity (25Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 26Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar, 27Hood J.K.

Modification of proteins regulates their function, location, and stability. The present studies were undertaken to investigate the post-translational phosphorylation of SPHK2 and its involvement in the regulation of nucleo/cytoplasmic shuttling of this protein. Here we report, for the first time, that SPHK2 can be phosphorylated in an agonist-dependent manner. We also have identified a unique NES, in SPHK2, whose function is regulated by protein phosphorylation. Furthermore we have identified the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of the serine residue in the NES as protein kinase D (PKD) and demonstrate that the phosphorylation of SPHK2 by PKD is critical for its nuclear export under physiological conditions.

Three days after transfection cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 15 mm NaF, 30 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, protease inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science), and 1% Triton X-100). PKD was immunoprecipitated for 4 h at 4 °C with the anti-HA affinity matrix (Roche Applied Science) and then eluted for 12 h at 4 °C with HA-peptide (Sigma, 100 μg/ml) in kinase buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Peptide Phosphorylation by PKD—Peptide phosphorylation by PKD was determined as described previously (28Zugaza J.L. Sinnett-Smith J. Van Lint J. Rozengurt E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6220-6230Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 mg/ml syntide-2 or the NES peptide was phosphorylated by affinity-purified PKD in the presence of 100 μm [γ-32P]ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. After incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was terminated by adding 75 mm H3PO4 and spotting onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Millipore). After washing the paper with 75 mm H3PO4 the radioactivity incorporated into peptides was determined by Cerenkov counting. Cell Cultures—HeLa and HEK293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37 °C. siRNA—siRNA for human PKD1 (5′-CAA UCC UCA UUG UUU CGA AAT-3′ and 5′-UUC GAA ACA AUG AGG AUU GGC-3′), human PKD2 (5′-CAA GUU UAA CUG UCA CAA ACG-3′ and 5′-UUU GUG ACA GUU AAA CUU GCA-3′), human PKD3 (5′-CGG CUU CCA GAA CGA AUU ACT-3′ and 5′-UAA UUC GUU CUG GAA GCC GAC-3′), and the control siRNA (5′-UUC UCC GAA CGU GUC ACG UdTdT-3′ and 5′-ACG UGA CAC GUU CGG AGA AdTdT-3′) were synthesized at Japan Bio Services (Saitama, Japan). HeLa cells were transfected both with siRNA and various expression vector constructs using Lipofectamine2000. Antibody—Preparation of an antibody against hSPHK2 has been described (18Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated SPHK2 (P-SPHK2)-specific polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits against a phosphopeptide (CSPLHRpSVpSDLPLP) encompassing the NES region fused with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Nonspecific antibodies were removed by passing through a HiTrap N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated HP column (GE Healthcare BioScience Corp.) conjugated with the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptide (CSPLHRSVSDLPLP). This antibody can be used for immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry but not for immunoprecipitation studies. For the detection of endogenous P-SPHK2 HepG2 cell lysates (500 μg of protein) were mixed with 30 μl (gel volume) of phenyl-Sepharose (GE Healthcare UK Ltd., Buckinghamshire, UK) with constant agitation for 4 h at 4 °C. In this procedure SPHK2 was bound to the gel with an approximate recovery of 60%. The gels were collected by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti-SPHK2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-P-SPHK2 antibody. Immunofluorescence—Cells were grown on four-chambered slides (Nalge/Nunc) and transfected using Fugene-6 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). Subcellular localization studies using confocal microscopy were performed as described previously (29Hayashi S. Okada T. Igarashi N. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33319-33324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antibodies used were polyclonal anti-phosphoSPHK2 (see above; 1:1000) and polyclonal anti-SK2 (1:1000). The fluorescence of Alexa488 and Alexa594 was observed under a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510 META, Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany), with excitation at 488 nm using a 505-530 nm band-pass barrier filter and with excitation at 543 nm using a 560 nm long-pass barrier filter, respectively. Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching—The FRAP analysis was performed with the Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal laser-scanning microscope as described (30Carrero G. Crawford E. Th'ng J. de Vries G. Hendzel M.J. Methods Enzymol. 2004; 375: 415-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells transfected with SPHK2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) were treated without or with 100 nm PMA for 30 min, and then each nuclear or cytoplasmic region of interest was photobleached by scanning for 8 s with an argon laser at the highest power. Recovery of fluorescence in the nuclei after nuclear photobleach (nuclear import) or decrease in fluorescence in the nuclei after cytoplasmic photobleach (nuclear export) was then analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy with low laser power at the indicated times after photobleaching. For all of the images, the noise levels were reduced by line scan averaging. Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from HeLa cells (2 × 106 cells) using ISO-GEN (Nippon gene, Toyama, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instruction. cDNA synthesis and real-time quantitative PCR were carried out as described previously (19Okada T. Ding G. Sonoda H. Kajimoto T. Haga Y. Khosrowbeygi A. Gao S. Miwa N. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36318-36325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The primer sequences (sense and antisense) were as follows: human PKD1, 5′-CCA GGA AGG CGA TCT TAT TGA A-3′ and 5′-GCT GGA GCT CTG TAT GAA TGA ACA-3′; human PKD2, 5′-AGC AAC AAG GAC ACG CTG AGA-3′ and 5′-GAT TTC TGA CAG CGG AAT TTC C-3′; human PKD3, 5′-GGG CAA GGG AAA GAT CAC AA-3′ and 5′-TTC CTC CAT AAA CGA TGC CAA AC-3′; human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GCC ATC AAT GAC CCC TTC ATT-3′ and 5′-TCT CGC TCC TGG AAG ATG G-3′. The expression of each mRNA was normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA expression. Phorbol Ester Induces the Phosphorylation of SPHK2—Post-translational phosphorylation of proteins is an important modification regulating protein function, localization, and stability. To study whether SPHK2 can be phosphorylated, HeLa cells transiently expressing HA-SPHK2 were treated with a tumor promoter, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), which is known to induce phosphorylation of various cellular proteins (31Nishizuka Y. Science. 1986; 233: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (4036) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with PMA for 2 h led to strong phosphorylation of SPHK2 as assessed by the incorporation of 32Pi (Fig. 1A), suggesting that SPHK2 can indeed be phosphorylated by agonist treatment of cells. PMA-induced Accumulation of SPHK2 in the Cytoplasm—We have previously reported that subcellular distribution of SPHK2 changes depending on cell culture conditions, i.e. anti-proliferative conditions such as high confluency (18Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) or serum starvation (19Okada T. Ding G. Sonoda H. Kajimoto T. Haga Y. Khosrowbeygi A. Gao S. Miwa N. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 36318-36325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) resulted in the accumulation of SPHK2 in the nucleus. We have also identified an NLS that is important for its nuclear import and localization (18Igarashi N. Okada T. Hayashi S. Fujita T. Jahangeer S. Nakamura S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46832-46839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Because protein modifications can affect the function and localization of proteins, and because SPHK2 was phosphorylated by PMA treatment, we studied the effect of PMA on the localization of SPHK2, which under basal conditions is localized predominantly in the nucleus of HeLa cells. We observed that, in HeLa cells expressing HA-SPHK2, when treated with PMA, under conditions where phosphorylation is strongly induced, a redistribution of SPHK2 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm occurred (Fig. 1, B and C). PMA Induces the Nuclear Export of SPHK2—PMA-induced cytoplasmic accumulation of SPHK2 could be due to an increase in the nuclear export or an inhibition of nuclear import processes. To identify which of these mechanisms was important for the observed effects, the PMA-induced shuttling of SPHK2 was further characterized by FRAP analysis. HeLa cells transiently expressing SPHK2-GFP were analyzed for the dynamics of the fluorescent protein after photobleaching. When the fluorescent protein in the nucleus was photo-bleached, recovery of nuclear fluorescence was almost indistinguishable between control and PMA-treated cells (Fig. 2, A and B). On the other hand, when fluorescence in the cytoplasmic region was photobleached, the rate of decrease in fluorescence intensity in the nuclear region was markedly (4-fold) enhanced by PMA treatment. These results indicate that PMA mainly causes an increase in the nuclear export of SPHK2, rather than an inhibition of nuclear import which results in the accumulation of SPHK2 in the cytosol. Further, we found that when HEK293 cells expressing HA-SPHK2 were treated with leptomycin B it led to an accumulation of SPHK2 in the nucleus. Leptomycin B can bind covalently to a cysteine residue in the nuclear export receptor chromosomal region maintenance 1 (CRM1) (32Nishi K. Yoshida M. Fujiwara D. Nishikawa M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6320-6324Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and interfere with the binding of both Ran and the cargo proteins (33Fukuda M. Asano S. Nakamura T. Adachi M. Yoshida M. Yanagida M. Nishida E. Nature. 1997; 390: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 34Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1741) Google Scholar), thereby inhibiting CRM1-mediated nuclear export of cargo proteins. This indicates a CRM1-mediated nuclear export of SPHK2 (data not shown). Taken together, these results along with those of Fig. 1 suggest a strong correlation between protein phosphorylation and nuclear export of SPHK2. Identification of NES in SPHK2—Proteins that are exported from nucleus in a CRM1-dependent manner are known to contain NES sequences, which consist of several leucine residues distributed with an uneven spacing (35Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 36Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S. Cell. 1995; 82: 463-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). As PMA-induced localization changes of SPHK2 were predominantly related to nuclear export, we sought to identify and characterize one or more NESs in the SPHK2 molecule. Close inspection of the SPHK2 sequence revealed at least one putative leucine-rich NES-like motif in the middle divergent region of the protein (Fig. 3A) along with several other potential NES-like sequences that were not investigated further during the present studies. It is known that changing the hydrophobic leucine residues of many CRM1-dependent NES sequences to alanine abrogates the export function of the NES (35Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Luhrmann R. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 36Wen W. Meinkoth J.L. Tsien R.Y. Taylor S.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 20024-20028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To determine whether the NES-like sequence was functional in the wild-type protein, we constructed an alanine substitution mutant in the NES-like sequence (NES mutant: leucines 423 and 425 into alanine, L423A/L425A) and studied its subcellular distribution when expressed in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were chosen, because transiently expressed recombinant SPHK2 is localized mainly in the cytosol of these cells. When the NES mutant was expressed in HEK293 cells, the number of cells showing nuclear predominant localization of the mutant protein was mildly increased (2- to 3-fold) compared with cells expressing wild-type protein (Fig. 3, B and C), suggesting that the NES is functional under basal conditions. It should be noted that the expression level and in vitro enzymatic activity of the NES mutant were similar to that of the WT protein indicating the mutations did not lead to gross structural changes in the protein (data not shown). Phosphorylation of SPHK2 at Serine Residue(s) within the NES and Its Nuclear Exit—Phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of nuclear shuttling proteins especially close to the NLS (38Rihs H.P. Jans D.A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 19209-19216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) is known to regulate the shuttling of these proteins. Because the NES is working weakly under basal conditions (Fig. 3) and contains two potential phosphorylation sites just after arginine 418 within its sequence, we speculated that one or both of the serine residues (419 and 421) in the NES may be the target of PMA-induced phosphorylation that is important for the regulation of the nuclear shuttling of this protein. To demonstrate this we constructed an alanine substitution mutant SPHK2S419A/S421A in the NES sequence (phosphorylation-deficient mutant: serines 419 and 421 into alanine) (Fig. 4A) and compared its subcellular localization with wild-type SPHK2 after expression in HeLa cells. The mutation did not affect the enzymatic activity or the expression of the mutant SPHK2 (data not shown). As expected, in contrast to wild-type SPHK2 the phosphorylation-deficient mutant lost its ability to exit from the nucleus in response to PMA treatment (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that nucleo/cytoplasmic shuttling of SPHK2 may be regulated by phosphorylation of the serine(s) in the NES. To further implicate the importance of phosphorylation of SPHK2 during its nuclear export, we generated an antibody that specifically recognizes the phosphorylated NES which has two serine residues at positions 419 and 421 that can potentially be phosphorylated. To show the specificity of this phosphorylated SPHK2 (P-SPHK2)-specific antibody SPHK2 was phosphorylated in a purified in vitro system by PKD and subjected to immunoblot analysis. P-SPHK2-specific antibody recognized the prote"

We describe a strategy for the recovery of genetic information from damaged DNA. By molecular breeding of polymerase genes from the genus Thermus (Taq (Thermus aquaticus), Tth (Thermus thermophilus) and Tfl (Thermus flavus)) and compartmentalized self-replication selection, we have evolved polymerases that can extend single, double and even quadruple mismatches, process non-canonical primer-template duplexes and bypass lesions found in ancient DNA, such as hydantoins and abasic sites. Applied to the PCR amplification of 47,000-60,000-year-old cave bear DNA, these outperformed Taq DNA polymerase by up to 150% and yielded amplification products at sample dilutions at which Taq did not. Our results demonstrate that engineered polymerases can expand the recovery of genetic information from Pleistocene specimens and may benefit genetic analysis in paleontology, archeology and forensic medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2018544658,"The trafficking of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) involves multiple complex pathways, including regulated, cAMP-, and cGMP-mediated pathways, as well as a constitutive recycling pathway. Although several accessory proteins have been indirectly implicated in AQP2 recycling, the direct protein-protein interactions that regulate this process remain largely unknown. Using yeast two-hybrid screening of a human kidney cDNA library, we have identified the 70-kDa heat shock proteins as AQP2-interacting proteins. Interaction was confirmed by mass spectrometry of proteins pulled down from rat kidney papilla extract using a GST-AQP2 C-terminal fusion protein (GST-A2C) as a bait, by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) assays, and by direct binding assays using purified hsc70 and the GST-A2C. The direct interaction of AQP2 with hsc70 is partially inhibited by ATP, and the Ser-256 residue in the AQP2 C terminus is important for this direct interaction. Vasopressin stimulation in cells enhances the interaction of hsc70 with AQP2 in IP assays, and vasopressin stimulation in vivo induces an increased co-localization of hsc70 and AQP2 on the apical membrane of principal cells in rat kidney collecting ducts. Functional knockdown of hsc70 activity in AQP2 expressing cells results in membrane accumulation of AQP2 and reduced endocytosis of rhodamine-transferrin. Our data also show that AQP2 interacts with hsp70 in multiple in vitro binding assays. Finally, in addition to hsc70 and hsp70, AQP2 interacts with several other key components of the endocytotic machinery in co-IP assays, including clathrin, dynamin, and AP2.

Although the complicated pathways of intracellular AQP2 trafficking remain to be completely elucidated, even less is known about the direct interaction of AQP2 or AQP2-containing vesicles with a host of accessory factors that must be involved in these processes. Understanding these interactions is a critical step in dissecting the processes of exocytosis, endocytosis, intracellular translocation, as well as degradation and shedding of AQP2 that all contribute to the final physiological response to VP in vivo. Many of the cytosolic proteins known to be involved in vesicular trafficking in general have also been implicated in AQP2 trafficking, including cytoskeletal components such as actin filaments, myosins, and microtubules, SNARE proteins, Rab proteins, and heterotrimeric G proteins, as well as protein kinases and their associated proteins (1Brown D.

However, direct evidence regarding the interaction of AQP2 with these components of the trafficking machinery remains scarce, although more information is slowly emerging in this area. For example, a recent study has identified AQP2 as a component of a multiprotein “motor” complex, including actin and the rho GTPase regulatory protein SPA1 (16Noda Y. Horikawa S. Furukawa T. Hirai K. Katayama Y. Asai T. Kuwahara M. Katagiri K. Kinashi T. Hattori M. Minato N. Sasaki S. FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Even before AQP2 was identified, several studies had suggested that water channels in the collecting duct are internalized via a clathrin-mediated endocytotic process (17Brown D. Orci L. Nature. 1983; 302: 253-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that AQP2 traffics via this clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway in either a regulated or a constitutive manner. Blocking the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis either with dominant-negative dynamin or pharmacologically using methyl-β-cyclodextrin results in hormone-independent and phosphorylation-independent plasma membrane accumulation of AQP2 in transfected cell models (6Sun T.X.

Physiol. 2006; 291: F246-F253Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The clathrin-mediated endocytotic pathway is one of the major routes of endocytosis in eukaryotic cells and is characterized by the selective internalization of specific proteins from the cell surface. A complex series of protein-protein interactions is involved in the regulation and selectivity of this process, which is highly regulated and dynamic, and involves rapid assembly or disassembly of transient protein complexes that involve the activity of both ATPases and GTPases (19Brodsky F.M.

Of particular interest, recent studies have expanded the many well known functions of heat shock protein 70, such as participating in protein synthesis, folding and assembly, translocation, degradation, and surface antigen presentation, to a novel role in mediating endocytosis (21Mayer M.P.

Cell. 2001; 12: 1303-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Many data have also shown that heat shock protein 70 is highly concentrated in the papilla of mammalian kidney, and a hypertonicity-responsive element that regulates hsp70 expression was identified in cultured kidney cells (33Woo S.K. Lee S.D. Na K.Y. Park W.K. Kwon H.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5753-5760Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis of the mouse kidney after water deprivation reveals an up-regulation of hsp70 expression, and a more recent proteomic analysis of the inner medullary collecting duct of Brattleboro rats after vasopressin treatment revealed that the level of heat shock protein 70 is increased in response to [deamino-Cys, d-Arg8] vasopressin (34van Balkom B.W.

All these data and the emerging appreciation of the role hsc70 in mediating channel trafficking raised the possibility that the 70-kDa heat shock proteins may also play a role in mediating AQP2 recycling. In this study, we use convergent techniques to show that both hsc70 and hsp70 interact with AQP2 directly and that the interaction with hsc70 is important for AQP2 trafficking/recycling. Chemicals and Antibodies—Lysine VP was obtained from Sigma. Tetramethylrhodamine transferrin conjugate was supplied by Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). GST, glutathione S-transferase-agarose, and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Purified, biotinylated hsc70 and purified hsp70 were purchased from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Purified hsp70 was biotinylated using a biotinylation kit from Pierce. Anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody was obtained from the supernatant of the 9E10 hybridoma cell line, which was purchased from the ATCC. Polyclonal antibodies against clathrin heavy chain, AP2, and dynamin 2 were kindly provided by Dr. Sanja Sever (36Sever S. Damke H. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1137-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Our affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody against the AQP2 C terminus has been described previously (37Sabolic I. Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Brown D. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 143: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Antibodies against hsc70 (rat monoclonal, SPA815) and hsp70 (mouse monoclonal, SPA 810, and rabbit polyclonal, SPA 812) were purchased from StressGen. Secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate or CY3-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Stable Cell Lines, DNA Constructs, and Recombinant Adenovirus—The generation of LLC-PK1 cell lines stably expressing c-Myc-tagged wild type AQP2, referred to as W2 in Figs. 3 and 4 and LLC-AQP2 in the remainder of the text and figures, has been described previously (7Katsura T. Verbavatz J.M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 38Katsura T. Gustafson C.E.

All cell lines were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C with 5% CO2.FIGURE 4AQP2 co-immunoprecipitates with hsc70 and hsp70. Panel A co-IP of AQP2 and hsc70 from AQP2 stably transfected LLC-AQP2 (W2) cells using an antibody against AQP2. Both cell lysate and kidney papilla extract were pre-cleared by protein A beads prior to co-IP experiments. hsc70 is detected in the co-IP complex pulled down with the anti-AQP2 antibody; AQP2 was also detected using anti-AQP2 antibody as expected (lower panel). Panel B shows co-IP of hsc70 and AQP2 using anti-hsc70 antibody. Both panels A and B show that antibodies against AQP2 or hsc70 are able to co-IP their binding counterparts from cell lysates, and this two way co-IP assay suggests an interaction between AQP2 and hsc70. Panel C shows that AQP2 is not only able to co-IP with hsc70 but also co-IP with hsp70 from rat kidney (Kid) papilla extract. Antibodies against hsc70 and hsp70 were used in this co-IP experiment. The molecular weight of AQP2 from LLC-AQP2 (W2) cells is greater than that from kidney papilla extract because of the presence of c-Myc tag in AQP2-transfected cells.

This bait protein was engineered as a single fusion peptide consisting of GAL4:DBD, plus the sequence coding for amino acids Met1-Glu16 from the N terminus of AQP2, Ala147-Ala161 from the second intracellular loop of AQP2, and Asn220-Ala271 from the C-tail of AQP2. The coding sequence of this C-terminal chimera construct was also subcloned into the bacterial expression vector pET41a (Novagen) as a fusion protein with a GST tag on its N terminus (39Bouley R. Breton S. Sun T. McLaughlin M. Nsumu N.N. Lin H.Y. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). All the constructs were sequenced to confirm their reading frame and predicted composition. The GAL4 AD:human kidney cDNA library constructed in the yeast plasmid pACT2 was purchased from Clontech. Recombinant adenoviruses expressing wild type hsc70 (Ad-hsc70), an ATPase-deficient hsc70 mutant (Ad-hscT204V), and a GTPase-deficient dynamin mutant (Ad-Dyn/K44A) were kindly provided by Dr. Sandra Schmidt (27Newmyer S.L. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Details of the infection of epithelial cells with adenovirus were described in our previous publication (6Sun T.X. Van Hoek A. Huang Y. Bouley R. McLaughlin M. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F998-F1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant adenovirus of ∼5 multiplicity of infection was used to infect LLC-AQP2 stably transfected cells. After incubation for 36 h, cells were harvested and used for immunochemistry or endocytosis assays with rhodamine-transferrin. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening and Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The yeast two-hybrid screening was performed in AH109 Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Clontech) that contains three reporters, ADE2, HIS3, and MEL1. The BD-expressing plasmid contains TRP1, and the AD-expressing plasmid contains LEU2. The medium stringency selection medium lacks tryptophan, leucine, and histidine; the high stringency selection medium lacks tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine but contains X-β-gal: 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (20 mg/ml). 3-Aminotriazole (2.5 mm) was added to both medium and high stringency selection media to inhibit HIS3 leakiness. The AH109 containing the pAS2-1/ALCT plasmid was transformed with 0.2 mg of AD:cDNA plasmid library using a modified lithium acetate method. The transformed cells were plated onto medium stringency selection medium and incubated at 30 °C for 14 days. Positive colonies were patched onto high stringency selection medium plates and incubated at 30 °C until sufficient growth was achieved and colonies turned blue. Colonies that activated all of the reporter genes in the AH109 stain were further analyzed. The AD:cDNA plasmid encoding the interacting protein was isolated from yeast cells and transformed to KC8 Escherichia coli. The colonies containing AD:cDNA plasmid were rescued on M9/-Leu selection medium plates, and the plasmid DNA was isolated and sent for sequencing. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed to further confirm the positive interaction of pAS2-1/ALCT and AD:cDNA plasmids as follows. AD:cDNA plasmids isolated from the primary screen were used to co-transform AH109 with pAS2-1/ALCT to confirm activation of reporters. The potential interacting clones were also co-transformed to AH109 with BD vector alone to test for false positivity. Transformed cells were plated on high stringency selection medium. AD:cDNA clones that were positive with pAS2-1/ALCT but negative with pAS2-1 were further characterized by DNA sequencing. Preparation of Cell Culture Lysates and Rat Kidney Papilla Extract—Cells were grown in 10-cm culture dishes in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with 10% fetal bovine serum) to 95% confluence. After various treatments, cells were washed three times with cold PBS and were scraped into lysis buffer (PBS buffer, pH 7.4, NaF 20 mm, Na3VO4 2mm, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1%Triton X-100, and a mixture of protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science)). Cell lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min and then passed 5-10 times through a 27-gauge syringe and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. The supernatants were used for pull down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Kidney papilla extract was prepared from Sprague-Dawley rat kidney. The papillae from two kidneys were washed three times with cold PBS and homogenized in a Teflon pestle homogenizer (Thomas Scientific). After passing through a syringe with a 25-gauge needle, the homogenates were resuspended in cold lysis buffer containing PBS, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaF, 2mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors. This rat kidney papilla extract was then used for pulldown and co-IP experiments. Expression and Purification of GST AQP2 Fusion Protein (GST-A2C)—Escherichia coli, BL21 (DE3) (Novagen), was used for GST fusion protein expression. DNA constructs encoding various GST-AQP2 C-terminal fusion proteins were transformed into bacteria using electroporation. Expression of GST-A2C in E. coli was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) at 37 °C for 4 h. Bacteria were lysed by lysozyme (1 mg/ml) and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in STE buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, EDTA 1 mm). Bacterial supernatant was allowed to bind to the glutathione-agarose column at 4 °C for 40 min with gentle rocking. After washing twice with STE buffer with 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% Triton X-100 and three times with normal STE buffer, the GST fusion protein was eluted with elution buffer (5 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) and further dialyzed against PBS buffer at 4 °C. Purified GST and GST-AQP2 fusion proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. Pulldown Experiments—Cell lysates and papilla extracts were pre-cleared on a glutathione column at 4 °C for 40 min. Approximately 20 μg of the GST or GST-A2C protein was incubated with 40 μl of glutathione beads and 500 μg to 1mg of pre-cleared cell lysate or rat kidney papilla extract at 4 °C with gentle rocking for 2 h. Then the glutathione beads were washed four times with PBS containing Nonidet P-40 (0.5%), Triton X-100 (0.5%), NaF (20 mm), and protease inhibitors to remove nonspecifically bound proteins. Finally, the pulled down material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. For mass spectrometry, the pulled down proteins from rat kidney papilla extracts were further processed with thrombin digestion (Novagen) and gel purification and finally sent for mass spectrometry analysis by MDS proteomics (Toronto, Canada). Meanwhile, purified GST-A2C fusion proteins were also used to pull down purified biotinylated hsc70 (StressGen) as mentioned above. Briefly, 20 μg of GST-A2C (wild type, S256A, and S256D constructs) was incubated with 40 μl of glutathione beads and 1 μg of biotinylated hsc70 at 4 °C for 2 h. After washing, the pulled down material was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin as a probe to detect the biotinylated hsc70 (Pierce). The immunoblots from five independent experiments were scanned, and mean signal intensity was calculated using IPLab Spectrum software. The percentages of the reduction of the ratio of biotinylation signal over AQP2 signal were calculated. Similar pulldown experiments were performed using purified wild type GST-A2C with purified, biotinylated hsc70 or hsp70, respectively, in the presence or absence of ADP (10 mm) or ATP (10 mm). Data were obtained from at least three independent experiments, analyzed using IPLab Spectrum software. As mentioned above, the percentages of the reduction of the signal intensity ratio of hsc70 (or hsp70) over AQP2 were calculated. Co-immunoprecipitation Procedure—Lysates from LLC-PK1, LLC-AQP2 (W2) cells, and rat kidney papilla extract were pre-cleared on protein A beads at 4 °C for 40 min prior to co-IP studies. Protein A beads (40 μl) were incubated with 0.5 μg of antibody and 500 μg of cell lysate or rat kidney papilla extract with gentle rocking for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing five times with washing buffer (PBS buffer, protease inhibitors, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% Triton X-100), the co-IP samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis using a variety of antibodies. Cell lysates incubated with protein A beads alone were routinely used as a negative control. Co-IP using lysates from nontransfected cells was also used as a negative control in each experiment. Studies were repeated at least three times. Immunocytochemistry and Electron Microscopy of Tissue and Cultured Cells—Rat kidney was fixed by cardiac perfusion with paraformaldehyde lysine periodate as described previously (39Bouley R.

Investig. 2000; 106: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) with or without pre-exposure to [deamino-Cys, d-Arg8] vasopressin administered for 3 days via Alzet osmotic minipumps implanted subcutaneously in the nape of the neck, and delivering about 1.2 μg or DDAVP per day. Tissues were rinsed three times for 5 min in PBS, cryo-protected in 30% sucrose in PBS, frozen, and sectioned at 5 μm for immunostaining. The kidney sections were treated with 1% SDS for 4 min to improve antigenicity (40Brown D. Lydon J. McLaughlin M. Stuart-Tilley A. Tyszkowski R. Alper S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS buffer before immunostaining. Primary antibodies against AQP2 (1:100) or hsc70 (or hsp70) (1:100) were added to kidney sections and incubated at room temperature for 90 min. After washing with PBS, fluorescein isothiocyanate- and CY3-conjugated secondary antibodies were applied for 60 min at room temperature. After final washes with PBS, sections were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame CA) and examined by conventional immunofluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse 800) and confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad Radiance 2000). LLC-PK1 or LLC-AQP2 cells were seeded onto coverslips and treated as described below. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min, washed three times for 5 min with PBS, permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 for 4 min, and then subjected to routine immunostaining for AQP2 or hsc70 as described previously (8Lu H. Sun T.X. Bouley R. Blackburn K. McLaughlin M. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: F233-F243Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). An estimate of translocation of AQP2 to the plasma membrane was obtained by quantitative analysis of AQP2 labeling in three independent experiments from cells infected with empty adenovirus (control), and cells infected with adenovirus expressing wild type hsc70, ATPase-deficient hsc70 mutant, and the GTPase-deficient K44A dynamin mutant. The percentage area occupied by AQP2 staining in a region of interest of the cytoplasm in each of at least 20 cells per experimental condition was quantified using IPLab Spectrum software, as described previously (39Bouley R. Breton S. Sun T. McLaughlin M. Nsumu N.N. Lin H.Y. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), and was compared with the control cells. The loss of cytoplasmic staining was shown previously to parallel an increase in membrane staining during the AQP2 trafficking process. For electron microscopy, kidneys were fixed by perfusion with paraformaldehyde lysine periodate. Small blocks of tissue were dehydrated through a"
https://openalex.org/W2009414144,"Phosphinothricin tripeptide (PTT, phosphinothricylalanylalanine) is a natural-product antibiotic and potent herbicide that is produced by Streptomyces hygroscopicus ATCC 21705 (ref. 1) and Streptomyces viridochromogenes DSM 40736 (ref. 2). PTT has attracted widespread interest because of its commercial applications and unique phosphinic acid functional group. Despite intensive study since its discovery in 1972 (see ref. 3 for a comprehensive review), a number of steps early in the PTT biosynthetic pathway remain uncharacterized. Here we report a series of interdisciplinary experiments involving the construction of defined S. viridochromogenes mutants, chemical characterization of accumulated intermediates, and in vitro assay of selected enzymes to examine these critical steps in PTT biosynthesis. Our results indicate that early PTT biosynthesis involves a series of catalytic steps that to our knowledge has not been described so far, including a highly unusual reaction for carbon bond cleavage. In sum, we define a pathway for early PTT biosynthesis that is more complex than previously appreciated."
https://openalex.org/W2065394018,"Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase represents one mechanism by which cholesterol synthesis is controlled in mammalian cells. The key reaction in this degradation is binding of reductase to Insig proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is stimulated by the cholesterol precursor lanosterol. Conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol requires removal of three methyl groups, which consumes nine molecules of dioxygen. Here, we report that oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) slows demethylation of lanosterol and its metabolite 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, causing both sterols to accumulate in cells. In addition, hypoxia increases the amount of Insig-1 and Insig-2 in a response mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α. Accumulation of lanosterol together with increased Insigs accelerates degradation of reductase, which ultimately slows a rate-determining step in cholesterol synthesis. These results define a novel oxygen-sensing mechanism mediated by the combined actions of methylated intermediates in cholesterol synthesis and the hypoxia-activated transcription factor HIF-1α."
https://openalex.org/W2014050156,"β-Adrenergic receptors critically modulate long-lasting synaptic plasticity and long-term memory in the mammalian hippocampus. Persistent long-term potentiation of synaptic strength requires protein synthesis and has been correlated with some forms of hippocampal long-term memory. However, the intracellular processes that initiate protein synthesis downstream of the β-adrenergic receptor are unidentified. Here we report that activation of β-adrenergic receptors recruits ERK and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling to facilitate long-term potentiation maintenance at the level of translation initiation. Treatment of mouse hippocampal slices with a β-adrenergic receptor agonist results in activation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E kinase Mnk1, along with inhibition of the translation repressor 4E-BP. This coordinated activation of translation machinery requires concomitant ERK and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling. Taken together, our data identify distinct signaling pathways that converge to regulate β-adrenergic receptor-dependent protein synthesis during long-term synaptic potentiation in the hippocampus. We suggest that β-adrenergic receptors play a crucial role in gating the induction of long-lasting synaptic plasticity at the level of translation initiation, a mechanism that may underlie the ability of these receptors to influence the formation of long-lasting memories. β-Adrenergic receptors critically modulate long-lasting synaptic plasticity and long-term memory in the mammalian hippocampus.

Activation of hippocampal noradrenergic afferents induces protein synthesis-dependent long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength in awake animals (12Walling S.G. Harley C.W. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 598-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of β-ARs during weak synaptic activity elicits protein synthesis-dependent enhancement of LTP in hippocampal slices (13Gelinas J.N. Nguyen P.V. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3294-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 14Huang Y.Y. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 611-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that stimulate protein synthesis following activation of β-ARs and the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate this initiation of translation are unknown. Thus, an important question is as follows: How does activation of β-ARs elicit translation to facilitate induction of protein synthesis-dependent LTP? Eukaryotic protein synthesis is controlled primarily at the level of translation initiation (15Dever T.E. Cell. 2002; 108: 545-556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 16Klann E. Antion M.D. Banko J.L. Hou L. Learn.

Recognition of the mRNA and ribosomal recruitment are intricately regulated, rate-limiting steps that involve the initiation factor eIF4E and its ability to form the eIF4F initiation complex, which serves as an anchoring site on the mRNA terminus for essential translation factors. In the basal state, eIF4E is sequestered by the inhibitory binding protein, 4E-BP (18Haghighat A. Mader S. Pause A. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5701-5709Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 19Mader S. Lee H. Pause A. Sonenberg N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4990-4997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Pause A.

We previously have demonstrated that the formation of the eIF4F initiation complex is a critical target of regulation during two forms of enduring synaptic plasticity. During group I metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) stimulate phosphorylation of 4E-BP (22Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar), which promotes formation of the eIF4F initiation complex and gates ERK-dependent eIF4E phosphorylation (34Banko J.L. Hou L. Poulin F. Sonenberg N. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of eIF4E by the ERK-dependent kinase, Mnk1, has been correlated with an increase in the rate of translation (23Duncan R.F. Peterson H. Hagedorn C.H. Sevanian A. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 213-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 24Scheper G.C. Proud C.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5350-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 25Wang X. Flynn A.

Interestingly, eIF4F initiation complex formation and eIF4E phosphorylation also are increased following one train of high frequency stimulation (HFS), the same stimulus that induces E-LTP; yet E-LTP typically does not require translation. When we genetically enhanced the level of complex formation by creating a 4E-BP2 knock-out mouse, we found that an E-LTP-inducing stimulus elicited enduring protein synthesis-dependent LTP (26Banko J.L. Poulin F. Hou L. DeMaria C.T. Sonenberg N. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9581-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Because pairing activation of β-ARs with E-LTP-inducing stimulation also produces enduring protein synthesis-dependent LTP, we asked whether activation of β-ARs could engage cap-dependent translation initiation machinery and elicit an increase in eIF4F initiation complex formation like that seen in the 4E-BP2 knock-out mice. Here we tested the hypothesis that β-ARs activate translation initiation signaling pathways and that activation of these path-ways leads to protein synthesis-dependent LTP in hippocampal area CA1 when paired with subthreshold stimulation. Our results indicate the following: 1) activation of the kinases mTOR and ERK are required for maintenance of β-AR-dependent LTP; 2) activation of β-ARs engages cap-dependent translation initiation signaling pathways and elicits eIF4F initiation complex formation, a process that is further increased when β-AR activation is paired with E-LTP inducing stimulation; and 3) mTOR and ERK signaling pathways converge at regulation of eIF4E during β-AR LTP, which is also observed during mGluR-LTD (34Banko J.L. Hou L. Poulin F. Sonenberg N. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), suggesting that this mechanism of eIF4E regulation is common to enduring forms of protein synthesis-dependent synaptic plasticity. Animals—Female C57BL/6 mice (aged 8-13 weeks; Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Montreal, Canada) were used for all experiments unless otherwise indicated. 4E-BP2 knock-out mice (aged 8-13 weeks) were used for some electrophysiology experiments. Heterozygous mice were originally derived on a mixed 129/SvJ and BALB/c background. Congenic C57BL/6 mutant mice were developed using marker-assisted breeding with the assistance of the JAX Genome Services group from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Currently, the 4E-BP2 knock-out colony is at N13 on a C57BL/6J background. All mice were housed under guidelines set forth by the Canadian Council on Animal Care and IACUC. Electrophysiology—Transverse hippocampal slices (400 μm) were obtained following cervical dislocation and decapitation. Slices were transferred to an interface recording chamber and maintained at 28 °C. Oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mm) 125 NaCl, 4.4 KCl, 1.5 MgSO4, 1.0 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, 10 glucose, 2.5 CaCl2 was used for dissection and perfusion. Slices were allowed to recover for at least an hour before recordings were attempted. Field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs) were elicited by stimulation of Schaeffer collaterals and subsequently recorded with a glass microelectrode positioned in stratum radiatum of area CA1. Baseline test stimuli were applied once per min at a stimulus intensity set to elicit 40% of maximal fEPSP amplitude (0.08 ms pulse width). LTP was induced with an HFS protocol consisting of 1 train of 100 Hz (1 s duration). fEPSPs were monitored with test stimuli for 120 min after induction of LTP. Drugs—The β-AR agonist isoproterenol (ISO; R(-)-isoproterenol (+)-bitartrate, 1 μm; Sigma) was prepared daily as a 1 mm stock solution in distilled water. The MEK inhibitor U0126 (20 μm; Bioshop Canada, Burlington, Ontario, Canada) and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Rap; 1 μm; Bioshop) were dissolved in Me2SO to make stock solutions at 20 and 1 mm, respectively. Each drug was diluted in ACSF and bath-applied at a perfusion rate of 1-2 ml/min. The concentrations of inhibitors used here have been shown to effectively block their respective kinase activities in in vitro hippocampal preparations (27Kelleher R.J. II I Govindarajan A. Jung H.Y. Kang H. Tonegawa S. Cell. 2004; 116: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 28Tang S.J. Reis G. Kang H. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Schuman E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in dimmed light conditions because of drug photosensitivity. Data Analysis—Initial slope of the fEPSP was used as an index of synaptic strength (29Johnston D. Wu S. Foundations of Cellular Neurophysiology. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1995Google Scholar). This slope was calculated between two points (point 1 and point 2) using Equation 1, slope=(voltage 2−voltage 1)/(time 2−time 1) (Eq. 1) Points 1 and 2 were selected 2-5 ms after the onset of the stimulus artifact, and they encompassed the initial linear down slope of the fEPSP (which is proportional to synaptic current and thus synaptic strength (29Johnston D. Wu S. Foundations of Cellular Neurophysiology. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1995Google Scholar)). fEPSP slopes from 20 min of stable baseline recording were averaged to obtain a baseline slope value for each experiment. All subsequent slopes were reported as percentages of these baseline slopes. We then compared inter-group levels of LTP at 120 min after LTP induction. Two-tailed unpaired Student's t test was used for statistical comparison between two groups, with Welch correction if standard deviations were significantly different between groups. The significance criterion was p < 0.05 in all cases. Data are reported as means ± S.E., with n equal to number of slices. Tissue Preparation for Biochemistry—CA1 regions from hippocampal slices prepared for electrophysiology were microdissected and homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (HB) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitor mixtures 10 min after application of stimulation protocol. The total protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Immunoprecipitation—Homogenates were precleared for 1 h with 50% protein A magnetic bead slurry. They were then sequentially incubated with anti-eIF4G1 antibody (10 μg) and 50% protein A magnetic bead slurry for 1 h at room temperature. The homogenates were subjected to a magnetic field, and the supernatant was discarded. The retained immunoprecipitated protein complexes were washed with fresh HB and eluted from the beads with β-mercaptoethanol before analysis by quantitative Western blotting. Quantitative Western Blot Analysis—Equivalent amounts of protein for each sample were resolved in 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with reversible MemCode protein stain to confirm equal loading and transfer. Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.24% I-Block (Tropix; Bedford, MA) and then incubated with the antibody of interest (phospho-ERK antibody (1:5000), phospho-Mnk1 antibody (1:1000), phospho-eIF4E antibody (1:1000), phospho-4E-BP1 antibody (1:500), total eIF4E (1:1000), or eIF4G1 antibody (1:1000)) for 1 h at room temperature. All antibodies were from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA) except for eIF4G1, which was obtained from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX). The phospho-4E-BP1 antibody has been shown to crossreact with 4E-BP2, ensuring detection of the predominantly neuronal 4E-BPs (26Banko J.L. Poulin F. Hou L. DeMaria C.T. Sonenberg N. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9581-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-linked goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:2500 dilution; Promega; Madison, WI) for 1 h at room temperature. All blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were stripped with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) for 1 h at 55 °C with agitation. The bands of each Western blot were quantified from film exposures in the linear range for each antibody and normalized to the MemCode membrane staining with densitometry using a desktop scanner and NIH Image software to determine the amount of immunoreactivity. GraphPad Prism data analysis software was used for graph production and statistical analysis. Statistical analysis via one-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni post tests were employed to assess the nonstandardized optical density data, with p < 0.05 as the significance criterion. Data were standardized as percent of control for graphing purposes. Immunohistochemistry—After appropriate pharmacological and/or electrical stimulation, hippocampal slices were immediately put in ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 7.4) and fixed over-night. The slices were then put in 30% sucrose overnight at 4 °C and embedded with optimal cutting compound. A sliding microtome was used to cut the slices into 20-μm sections. Free-floating sections were blocked with 10% normal goat serum in PBS, 0.7% Triton X-100 (PBS-TX) overnight at 4 °C. Sections were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with phospho-4E-BP1 (Thr-37/46) antibody (1:100). After washing three times with PBS-TX, sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with Cy3-conjugated Affi-niPure goat anti-rabbit IgG diluted 1:500 in blocking solution. Sections were then washed and mounted onto poly-l-lysine-coated slides. Sections were analyzed and imaged using a Zeiss LSM510 META confocal microscope system (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Each experiment was repeated a minimum of three times, imaging at least 10 dendritic puncta to quantify p-4EBP in dendrites. Puncta were delineated manually, and average pixel intensity was measured using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. One-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test was employed to determine statistical significance. β-Adrenergic Receptor-dependent Enhancement of LTP Maintenance Requires ERK and mTOR Signaling—Activation of β-ARs in hippocampal area CA1 can potently enhance synaptic responses to electrical stimulation (13Gelinas J.N. Nguyen P.V. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3294-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 31Thomas M.J. Moody T.D. Makhinson M. O'Dell T.J.

Neurosci. 1992; 12: 506-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Application of a β-AR agonist (ISO, 1 μm) in the absence of high frequency electrical stimulation generated a small, transient increase in synaptic strength that faded soon after drug washout (Fig. 1A; fEPSP slopes were 106 ± 6% 60 min after ISO application). Similarly, stimulation with one train of high frequency stimulation (HFS; 1 × 100 Hz with 1-s duration) induced decremental LTP that decayed to pre-HFS levels within 120 min (Fig. 1B; fEPSP slopes were 111 ± 6% 120 min after HFS). However, pairing this HFS with ISO application generated long-lasting LTP (Fig. 1B; fEPSP slopes were 156 ± 9% 120 min after HFS, p < 0.01 compared with HFS alone). This LTP has been shown to require dendritic protein synthesis (13Gelinas J.N. Nguyen P.V. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3294-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Because ERK and mTOR are involved in dendritic protein synthesis (27Kelleher R.J. II I Govindarajan A. Jung H.Y. Kang H. Tonegawa S. Cell. 2004; 116: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 28Tang S.J. Reis G. Kang H. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Schuman E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sonenberg N. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), we tested the hypothesis that ERK and mTOR are recruited by β-AR activation to enhance the maintenance of LTP. LTP induced by one train of HFS alone is usually independent of protein synthesis and is not substantially disrupted by inhibition of ERK or mTOR (35Winder D.G. Martin K.C. Muzzio I.A. Rohrer D. Chruscinski A. Kobilka B. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1999; 24: 715-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 36Cammalleri M. Lutjens R. Berton F. King A.R. Simpson C.

Therefore, inhibition of ERK or mTOR activity should affect only the β-AR-dependent component of LTP generated by pairing one train of HFS and ISO application. Treatment with an inhibitor of MEK (the upstream ERK kinase), U0126 (20 μm), attenuated β-AR-dependent LTP. Two hours after HFS, mean fEPSP slopes were 104 ± 4% for slices treated with U0126, compared with 156 ± 15% for slices treated with ISO + HFS alone (Fig. 2A; p < 0.05). Application of an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin (1 μm), also attenuated LTP maintenance. Mean fEPSP slopes 120 min after HFS were 114 ± 14% in rapamycin-treated slices and 164 ± 14% in slices treated with ISO + HFS alone (Fig. 2B; p < 0.05). These data indicate that ERK and mTOR signaling pathways are necessary for the induction of long-lasting β-AR-dependent LTP. Induction of β-Adrenergic Receptor-dependent LTP Engages the Coordinated Regulation of Translation Initiation Factors Mnk1, eIF4E, and 4E-BP—Although β-AR-dependent LTP requires protein synthesis, β-ARs have not been shown previously to couple to the translational machinery. Therefore, it is unclear whether our previous demonstration of activation of translation initiation factors by one train of 100-Hz HFS (26Banko J.L. Poulin F. Hou L. DeMaria C.T. Sonenberg N. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9581-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) is sufficient to account for the protein synthesis dependence during β-AR-dependent LTP (13Gelinas J.N. Nguyen P.V. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 3294-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Alternatively, β-ARs might recruit additional activation of these pathways to gate this form of enduring plasticity. In neurons, activation of ERK and mTOR can regulate plasticity-related protein synthesis by engaging multiple translation factors (27Kelleher R.J. II I Govindarajan A. Jung H.Y. Kang H. Tonegawa S. Cell. 2004; 116: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 28Tang S.J. Reis G. Kang H. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Schuman E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, the ERK and mTOR signal transduction pathways converge during metabotropic glutamate receptor-dependent long-term depression (mGluR-LTD) to regulate the critical translation initiation factor, eIF4E (34Banko J.L. Hou L. Poulin F. Sonenberg N. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2167-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 38Hou L. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 6352-6361Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Because we found that β-AR-dependent LTP required ERK and mTOR activation, we asked whether β-AR activation could similarly regulate translation initiation factors. The ERK-Mnk1-eIF4E signal transduction pathway can be engaged by various forms of synaptic stimulation, and its activation is associated with initiation of protein synthesis (26Banko J.L. Poulin F. Hou L. DeMaria C.T. Sonenberg N. Klann E. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 9581-9590Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 27Kelleher R.J. II I Govindarajan A. Jung H.Y. Kang H. Tonegawa S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). We found that activation of β-ARs with ISO activated ERK and Mnk1, as evidenced by enhanced phosphorylation of these kinases (Fig. 3, A-E, phospho-ERK, p < 0.01 versus ACSF; phospho-Mnk1, p < 0.02 versus ACSF). Interestingly, a significantly larger increase in phosphospecific immunoreactivity was observed when β-AR activation was paired with HFS (Fig. 3, A-E, ISO + HFS; phospho-ERK, p < 0.01 versus HFS alone; phospho-Mnk1, p < 0.05 versus HFS alone). This enhancement was blocked by the MEK inhibitor, U0126, but not by the mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin. Thus, ERK activation during β-AR-dependent LTP recruits Mnk1 independently of mTOR signaling. Activation of β-ARs with ISO also increased phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF4E (Fig. 4, A-C, phospho-eIF4E, p < 0.02 versus ACSF), consistent with the idea that β-ARs can engage the ERK-Mnk1-eIF4E signal transduction pathway. Similar to the results obtained for ERK and Mnk1, pairing ISO with HFS significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of eIF4E (Fig. 4, A-C, phospho-eIF4E, p < 0.05 versus HFS alone). However, this increase in phosphospecific immunore-activity was attenuated by application of either U0126 or rapamycin. This result indicates that, unlike Mnk1, eIF4E is dually regulated by ERK and mTOR signaling cascades. These data, taken together with the preponderance of literature demonstrating that one train of 100 Hz stimulation produces decremental LTP that is not dependent upon translation for its maintenance, suggest that β-ARs recruit additional activation of these translation initiation pathways to gate, and thereby enhance, the enduring plasticity achieved by pairing one train of 100 Hz with activation of β-ARs. Coordinated Regulation of eIF4E by mTOR and 4E-BP—The only eIF4E phosphorylation site that has been reported in mammals to significantly impact the affinity of eIF4E for the mRNA cap (i.e. translation initiation) is Ser-209 (for review see Ref. 16Klann E. Antion M.D. Banko J.L. Hou L. Learn. Mem. 2004; 11: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The ERK-dependent kinase, Mnk1, is reportedly responsible for phosphorylation of eIF4E Ser-209 in numerous systems (16Klann E. Antion M.D. Banko J.L. Hou L. Learn. Mem. 2004; 11: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 39Pyronnet S. Imataka H. Gingras A.C. Fukunaga R. Hunter T. Sonenberg N. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found that both the ISO and the ISO + HFS-induced Mnk1 and eIF4E phosphorylation required ERK activity (Figs. 3 and 4). However, we also observed that eIF4E phosphorylation was sensitive to rapamycin (Fig. 4). In an effort to define a mechanism for the rapamycin-dependent inhibition of the ISO + HFS-induced increase in phospho-eIF4E immunoreactivity, we performed an eIF4G/eIF4E co-immunoprecipitation assay (eIF4G/E co-immunoprecipitation; Fig. 5, A and B). It is well established that there is no direct binding site for Mnk1 on eIF4E. Instead, the phosphorylation event occurs via binding of both Mnk1 and eIF4E to the adaptor protein eIF4G (16Klann E. Antion M.D. Banko J.L. Hou L. Learn. Mem. 2004; 11: 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Consistent with the findings that ISO and ISO + HFS increased eIF4E phosphorylation of Ser-209, we found that pairing ISO with HFS induced a greater increase in the amount of eIF4E that co-precipitated with eIF4G compared with either treatment alone (Fig. 5, A and B, eIF4G/E co-immunoprecipitation; p < 0.02 versus ISO alone; p < 0.05 versus HFS alone). eIF4G and 4E-BP compete for the same binding site on eIF4E, and it is this condition that defines 4E-BP as a translational repressor. When eIF4E is bound to 4E-BP it cannot bind to the adaptor protein eIF4G and form the initiation complex that serves as the anchoring site for additional necessary initiation factors. In this situation, translation cannot commence. The affinity of 4E-BP for eIF4E is"

Also known as complex II, this tetrameric enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate and reduces ubiquinone. Mutations in the human SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD genes are tumorigenic, leading to the development of several types of tumors, including paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. The mechanisms linking SDH mutations to oncogenesis are still unclear. In this work, we used the yeast SDH to investigate the molecular and catalytic effects of tumorigenic or related mutations. We mutated Arg47 of the Sdh3p subunit to Cys, Glu, and Lys and Asp88 of the Sdh4p subunit to Asn, Glu, and Lys. Both Arg47 and Asp88 are conserved residues, and Arg47 is a known site of cancer causing mutations in humans. All of the mutants examined have reduced ubiquinone reductase activities. The SDH3 R47K, SDH4 D88E, and SDH4 D88N mutants are sensitive to hyperoxia and paraquat and have elevated rates of superoxide production in vitro and in vivo.We also observed the accumulation and secretion of succinate. Succinate can inhibit prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, which initiate a proliferative response through the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α.

The mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, also known as complex II or succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) 4The abbreviations used are:SDHsuccinate dehydrogenaseFADflavin adenine dinucleotideQPproximal quinone-binding sitePBSphosphate-buffered salineDCPIPdichlorophenol indophenolPMSphenazine methosulfateROSreactive oxygen speciesDHEdihydroethidiumHIFhypoxia-inducible factorPHprolyl hydroxylase is a critical enzyme linking the mitochondrial respiratory chain and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. SDH is an iron-sulfur flavoprotein that resides in the mitochondrial inner membrane and functions to oxidize succinate to fumarate and reduce ubiquinone (Q) to ubiquinol (1Ackrell B.A.C. Johnson M.K.

Mutations in the human SDHB, SDHC, and SDHD genes lead to inheritable forms of cancer such as pheochromocytomas (catechol-secreting tumors commonly occurring in the adrenal medulla), paragangliomas (benign vascularized tumors in the head and neck), and renal cell carcinoma (9Baysal B.E.

Assoc. 2004; 292: 943-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). More recently, it was reported that loss of the SDHD gene may contribute to gastric and colon cancers (12Habano W. Sugai T. Nakamura S. Uesugi N. Higuchi T. Terashima M. Horiuchi S. Oncol. Rep. 2003; 10: 1375-1380PubMed Google Scholar). These observations highlight the importance of SDH genes as mitochondrial tumor suppressors (13Gottlieb E. Tomlinson I.P. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Moreover, the SDHC and SDHD subunits are also implicated as regulators of apoptosis (14Albayrak T. Scherhammer V. Schoenfeld N. Braziulis E. Mund T. Bauer M.K. Scheffler I.E. Grimm S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3082-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 15Ishii T. Yasuda K. Akatsuka A. Hino O. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar). There are currently three models that link SDH deficiencies and oncogenesis. The first model suggests that mitochondria-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) result in oxidative damage of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, mutagenesis, and tumorigenesis. Expression of an SDHC gene with a V69E mutation in a mouse cell line leads to ROS overproduction and the ability to form benign tumors when injected into nude mice (15Ishii T. Yasuda K. Akatsuka A. Hino O. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant SDH leaks electrons to molecular oxygen and forms superoxide anions. SDH is not normally thought of as a major source of ROS, but evidence of oxidative stress, shortened lifespan of model organisms, genomic instability, and tumorigenesis associated with SDH mutations is accumulating (15Ishii T. Yasuda K. Akatsuka A. Hino O. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar, 16Walker D.W. Hajek P. Muffat J. Knoepfle D. Cornelison S. Attardi G. Benzer S. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 2003; 278: 47629-47635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The second model linking SDH dysfunction and oncogenesis also involves mitochondrial ROS, but in this case, the ROS act as signaling molecules that lead to the stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) (20Guzy R.D. Schumacker P.T. Exp. Physiol. 2006; 91: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions, the levels of HIF-1α are very low because of its constant degradation. HIF-1α degradation is signaled by its hydroxylation on two prolyl residues, a reaction catalyzed by prolyl hydroxylase (PH) enzymes. PH enzymes catalyze the conversion of proline residues, O2, and α-ketoglutarate to hydroxyproline, carbon dioxide, and succinate using ascorbate and Fe2+ as cofactors. Under hypoxic conditions, PH activity is reduced, and HIF-1α is stabilized. HIF activates a set of genes involved in angiogenesis, proliferation, cell survival, and glycolysis. High levels of ROS can induce a pseudo-hypoxic response by promoting the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, limiting PH activity and HIF-1α modification and degradation. In the third model, the signaling pathway involves succinate rather than ROS (21Selak M.A. Armour S.M. MacKenzie E.D. Boulahbel H. Watson D.G. Mansfield K.D. Pan Y. Simon M.C. Thompson C.B.

Genet. 2005; 14: 2231-2239Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar). Succinate accumulates as a result of SDH dysfunction and moves out of the mitochondria via the dicarboxylate carrier. It induces a pseudo-hypoxic response and HIF-1α stabilization via product inhibition of the PH enzymes. Mutations in the fumarate hydratase gene FH, which encodes another enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, are also associated with tumorigenesis activated by a pseudo-hypoxic response; in the case of FH mutations, fumarate accumulates and inhibits PH activity (23Pollard P.J.

High levels of succinate and the induction of HIF-1α have also been observed in SDHA-deficient fibroblasts, although tumorigenesis has not been observed, probably because the expression of a second isoform of SDHA in paragangliomas precludes succinate buildup (25Brière J.J. Favier J. Bénit P. Ghouzzi V.E. Lorenzato A. Rabier D. Di Renzo M.F. Gimenez-Roqueplo A.P. Rustin P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In this study, we used the yeast SDH to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms that link SDH function and tumorigenesis. We focused our attention on residues lining the QP site for two reasons. First, residues near the QP site are frequently mutated in paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma. In addition, the mev-1 mutation, also in the QP site, shortens lifespan, promotes apoptosis, and increases superoxide production in Caenorhabditis elegans; the mev-1 mutation is also tumorigenic in a murine model (15Ishii T. Yasuda K. Akatsuka A. Hino O. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 203-209PubMed Google Scholar, 17Ishii N. Fujii M. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanase S. Ayusawa D.

The human SDHC R72C mutation affects a conserved arginine residue located in the QP site (26Bayley J.P. van Minderhout I. Weiss M.M. Jansen J.C. Oomen P.H. Menko F.H. Pasini B. Ferrando B. Wong N.

We mutated the equivalent residue Arg47 in the yeast SDH3 gene to Cys, Glu, and Lys. Similarly, Asp113 is a conserved amino acid in the human SDHD gene, also located in the QP binding site. Single amino acid substitutions of Asp113 have not been reported in the SDH mutation data base (28Bayley J.P. Devilee P. Taschner P.E. BMC Med. Genet. 2005; 6: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), but an Asp113 mutation in combination with a frameshift mutation is associated with tumor formation (11Neumann H.P. Pawlu C. Peczkowska M. Bausch B. McWhinney S.R. Muresan M. Buchta M. Franke G. Klisch J. Bley T.A. Hoegerle S. Boedeker C.C. Opocher G. Schipper J. Januszewicz A. Eng C. J. Am. Med.

Genet. 2001; 100: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We mutated the equivalent yeast SDH4 residue Asp88 to Asn, Glu, and Lys. The SDH3 R47C and R47E mutations and the SDH4 D88K mutation result in a loss of respiratory competence. The SDH3 R47K and the SDH4 D88E and D88N mutations render the cells hypersensitive to oxygen and paraquat. Using in vivo and in vitro assays, we determined that these mutations increase the production of superoxide anions. Thus, SDH3 and SDH4 mutations can be a significant source of oxidative stress. Finally, all of the mutants secrete succinate, leading to highly elevated succinate to fumarate ratios in the medium. Our results confirm that the SDH QP site should be considered a significant source of ROS production and that mutations that reduce SDH activity lead to elevated levels of succinate. These observations suggest that elevated levels of both ROS and succinate may participate in delivering an oncogenic signal in human tumors. Strains, Media, Culture Conditions, and Isolation of Submitochondrial Particles—The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains sdh3W1 (MH125, sdh3::TRP1) and sdh4W2 (MH125, sdh4::TRP1) and the Escherichia coli strain DH5α have been described (30Oyedotun K.S.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 281-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 0.13-kb KpnI fragment from the SDH3 gene was replaced with a 0.83-kb KpnI fragment containing the TRP1 gene in the yeast strain, sdh4K6 (YPH499, sdh4::LYS2) (33Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The double knock-out strain was verified by PCR and complementation analysis. The yeast media (YPD, YPG, SG, SD, and YPGal) have been described (30Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol.

Acid secretion was assessed using YPDBP medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.5% glucose, 30 μg/ml bromocresol purple, pH 7.0) containing 2.5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0 (34de Kok J. Muller J.L.M. Slater E.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 387: 441-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). All of the site-directed mutants were confirmed by sequencing the entire gene as described (35Sarkar G. Sommer S.S. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 404-407PubMed Google Scholar). Oxygen sensitivity was measured on plates incubated at 30 °C in a jar continuously flushed with pure oxygen at ∼20 ml/min. Yeast precultures were grown on SD medium for 2 days to select for plasmid retention. YPGal medium was inoculated to a starting A600 = 0.1 and grown at 30 °C for 3 days. The cells were harvested and lysed in a French pressure cell for the preparation of submitochondrial particles (36Robinson K.M. von Kieckebusch-Gück A. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21347-21350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free Radical Determination—Intracellular ROS production was examined using dihydroethidium (DHE) and MitoSOX Red (Molecular Probes). MitoSOX is a lipid-soluble cation that accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix where it can be oxidized to a fluorescent product by superoxide (37Johnson-Cadwell L.I. Jekabsons M.B. Wang A. Polster B.M. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 2007; 6: 1619-1631Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar). DHE is uncharged and is not selectively accumulated in the mitochondrial matrix. As such, the fluorescent DHE oxidation product reports cytoplasmic and intermembrane space superoxide levels, although DHE may also be oxidized by hydrogen peroxide (37Johnson-Cadwell L.I. Jekabsons M.B. Wang A. Polster B.M. Nicholls D.G. J. Neurochem. 2007; 6: 1619-1631Crossref Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 38Solans A. Zambrano A. Rodriguez M. Barrientos A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 3063-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Both probes are cell-permeant, and the red fluorescence of the oxidation products is enhanced by intercalation into DNA (38Solans A. Zambrano A. Rodriguez M. Barrientos A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 3063-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in SG medium containing 0.05% glucose to an optical density at 600 nm of ∼2. Aliquots of 107 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 45 min at 25 °C in either 5 μm DHE or MitoSOX in the dark. Unlabeled cells were used to determine intrinsic fluorescence levels. The cells were washed three times and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence was measured using a LS 50B luminescence spectrometer (Perkin Elmer) with excitation and emission wavelengths of 510 and 580 nm, respectively. Enzyme Assays—SDH is normally isolated partially inhibited by oxaloacetate (39Singer T.P. Rocca E. Kearney E.B. Slater E.C. Flavins and Flavoproteins. Elsevier, Amsterdam1965: 391-420Google Scholar). To activate the enzyme, submitochondrial particles were preincubated in 20 mm succinate for 15 min at 30 °C immediately prior to analysis. The malonate-sensitive succinate-dependent reduction of ubiquinone was monitored spectro-photometrically as the decylubiquinone-mediated reduction of dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP) (40Kita K. Vibat C.R.T. Meinhardt S. Guest J.R. Gennis R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2672-2677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The succinate-dependent, phenazine methosulfate (PMS)-mediated malonate-sensitive reduction of DCPIP is used as a measure of the membrane-associated catalytic dimer. Succinate and glycerol phosphate cytochrome c reductase assays were performed as described (5Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol.

Superoxide generation was assayed as the superoxide dismutase-sensitive (from bovine erythrocytes; catalog number 190117, MP Biochemicals) and malonate-sensitive reduction of cytochrome c in the presence of 1 mm potassium cyanide (41Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ninety units of superoxide dismutase/ml were added to both sample and reference cuvettes. All of the assays were performed at room temperature. 1H NMR Analysis of Secreted Acids—Yeast strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in YP medium containing 0.25% glucose. The cells were removed by centrifugation, and the medium was subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and centrifugation. The supernatant was recovered, adjusted to pH 7 with NaOH, flash frozen in liquid N2, and stored at -80 °C until it could be lyophilized for 2 days and stored dry at 4 °C. The lyophilized material was dissolved in 570 μl of D2O (99.9%; Isotec Inc., Miamisburg, OH). Thirty μl of 5 mm 2,2-dimethyl-2-sila 3,3,4,4,5,5-hexadeuteropentane sulfonic acid were added as a chemical shift reference and used as a concentration standard for determining absolute metabolite concentrations. pH was also recorded for calibration purposes. The samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 min to remove particulate matter, and 500 μl of the supernatant were transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube. All of the spectra were acquired on a 600-MHz Inova NMR spectrometer at 25 °C using the tn noesy pulse sequence (circa Vnmr 6.1B software, Varian Inc). All of the spectra had an acquisition time of 4 s, a preacquisition delay of 1 s, a mixing time of 0.1 s, a sweep width of 7200 Hz, and 256 transients (42Saude E.J. Slupsky C.M. Sykes B.D.

Growth Phenotypes of the Mutants—The mutant SDH3 genes were cloned into the single copy shuttle vector YCplac33 and transformed into the SDH3 knock-out strain sdh3W1. Similarly, mutant SDH4 genes were cloned into the vector pRS416, and the resulting plasmids were introduced into sdh4W2. To quantify the ability of each strain to respire, growth yield assays on semisynthetic medium containing 0.1-0.5% galactose as the sole carbon source were performed (Fig. 2). S. cerevisiae exhibits a diauxic shift when cultured on galactose; an initial fermentative growth is followed by a respiratory phase when the fermentable carbon source is limiting (5Oyedotun K.S.

The strain sdh3W1/pYCplac33 (empty vector) achieved by fermentation alone a growth yield of 12 ± 1%. The SDH3 R47K mutant retained significant respiratory capacity with a 70 ± 6% growth yield. In contrast, the mutants R47C and R47E showed more severely impaired or abolished respiratory capacities with yields of 35 ± 4 and 12 ± 1%, respectively. We have previously noted that strains with a growth yield below ∼30% are unable to grow on minimal glycerol media. Thus, the yeast R47C mutation and likely its counterpart human R72C mutation that results in paraganglioma are strong alleles that severely impair SDH activity. The SDH4 deletion strain containing the empty vector sdh4W2/pRS416 achieves a growth yield of 10 ± 1% of the wild type (Fig. 2B). A similar growth yield for the D88K mutant indicates a complete loss of respiratory growth. In contrast, the D88E and D88N mutants have yields of 80 ± 7 and 72 ± 9%, respectively, demonstrating that they have retained significant respiratory capacity. We examined the abilities of the mutant strains to grow when glycerol, a nonfermentable carbon source, is available (Figs. 3, A and C, and 4, A and C). The SDH3 R47C and R47E mutants were unable to grow, whereas the R47K mutant grew as well as the wild type. Consistent with the galactose growth yield assays, the SDH4 D88K mutant is unable to grow on glycerol, whereas the D88E and D88N mutants displayed growth comparable with that of the wild type.FIGURE 4Respiratory growth of wild-type and mutant strains under normoxic or hyperoxic conditions. SDH3 (A and B) or SDH4 (C and D) knock-out strains transformed with wild type (WT) or empty vectors (Vec) or mutant SDH3 or SDH4 genes were grown overnight at 30 °C in SD. The cultures were serially diluted with sterile water, and 10-μl aliquots were spotted onto SG plates. The plates were incubated at 30 °C in an air atmosphere and photographed after 6 days (A and C) or in a tank continuously flushed with 100% oxygen and photographed after 7 days for SDH3 strains (B) and 6 days for SDH4 strains (D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Mutant Enzymes Assemble and Have Reduced Quinone Reductase Activity—We used two measures to assess the effects of the mutations on enzyme assembly.

This activity is a measure of the membrane-associated catalytic dimer; it does not require catalytically competent Sdh3p and Sdh4p subunits, but the subunits must be present to mediate membrane association of the Sdh1p/Sd"
https://openalex.org/W2075938093,"Chloroplast envelope quinone oxidoreductase (ceQORH) is an inner plastid envelope protein that is synthesized without cleavable chloroplast transit sequence for import. In the present work, we studied the in vitro-import characteristics of Arabidopsis ceQORH. We demonstrate that ceQORH import requires ATP and is dependent on proteinaceous receptor components exposed at the outer plastid surface. Competition experiments using small subunit precursor of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and precursor of ferredoxin, as well as antibody blocking experiments, revealed that ceQORH import does not involve the main receptor and translocation channel proteins Toc159 and Toc75, respectively, which operate in import of proteins into the chloroplast. Molecular dissection of the ceQORH amino acid sequence by site-directed mutagenesis and subsequent import experiments in planta and in vitro highlighted that ceQORH consists of different domains that act concertedly in regulating import.

Collectively, our results provide unprecedented evidence for the existence of a specific import pathway for transit sequence-less inner plastid envelope membrane proteins into chloroplasts. Plastids conduct vital biosynthetic functions, and many essential reactions are located exclusively within these organelles. However, plastids contain only limited coding information in their own DNA. Endosymbiotic evolution has resulted in the transfer to the nuclear genome of genes encoding the vast majority of plastid proteins. As a consequence of this displacement of genetic material, plastids had to evolve mechanisms to reimport cytoplasmically synthesized precursor proteins from the cytosol (1Soll J. Schleiff E. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 198-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 2Jarvis P. Robinson C. Curr.

In most cases, nucleus-encoded plastid proteins are synthesized in the cytosol as higher molecular weight precursors, with a cleavable N-terminal sequence called transit peptide (7Lee D.W. Lee S. Lee G.J. Lee K.H. Kim S. Cheong G.W. Hwang I. Plant Physiol. 2005; 140: 466-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Transit peptides contain all the information that is necessary and sufficient for import. During the actual import process, transit peptides are proteolytically removed by a stromal processing peptidase. Transit peptides can be simple, as found for stroma proteins, or bipartite, as found for proteins destined to thylakoids. In the latter case, the N-terminal part directs the precursor to the stroma, whereas the non-cleaved C-terminal part directs the partially processed precursors to their final intraorganellar destination; i.e. the thylakoid membranes and the thylakoid lumen. Ultimate precursor maturation occurs by virtue of the thylakoid-processing peptidase (8Richter S. Lamppa G.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 277: 43888-43894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (51) Google Scholar). During chloroplast import, the transit peptide first recognizes the chloroplast surface in a process involving membrane lipids and the translocon at the outer chloroplast envelope (TOC) 3The abbreviations used are:TOCtranslocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplastsTICtranslocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplastsceQORHchloroplast envelope quinone oxidoreductase homologueGFPgreen fluorescent proteinpSSUprecursor to the small subunit of RubiscoRubiscoribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenaseDTNB5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)PORA,-BNADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases A and BpFDprecursor of ferredoxin. (9Kouranov A. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The TOC complex consists of three distinct core subunits: the GTP-dependent Toc34 and Toc159 receptors and the translocation channel protein Toc75 (10Gutensohn M. Fan E. Frielingsdorf S. Hanner P. Hust B. Klösgen R.B. J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 163: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 11Kessler F. Schnell D.J. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 334-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Translocation across the inner envelope is mediated by another multiprotein complex, the translocon at the inner chloroplast envelope (TIC) and requires ATP in the stroma, most likely providing energy for the activity of chaperones (12Pain D. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3288-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the inner envelope, the integral membrane component Tic110 is supposed to form at least part of the translocation channel, whereas the integral membrane protein Tic20 is presumably involved in the formation of the protein translocation pore. In addition to these components of the presumed basic TIC complex, several auxiliary subunits have been identified, including the regulatory redox components Tic55, Tic32, and Tic62, the intermembrane space protein Tic22, and the chaperone coordinating factor Tic40 (10Gutensohn M. Fan E. Frielingsdorf S. Hanner P. Hust B. Klösgen R.B. J. Plant Physiol. 2006; 163: 333-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). All proteins targeted to the five different intraplastidic subcompartments (the inter-membrane space, the inner envelope, the stroma, the thylakoid membranes, and the lumen) contain cleavable N-terminal transit peptides that are quite variable in length and actual amino acid composition. In contrast, almost all proteins located at the outer envelope membrane do not bear such cleavable extensions, and their targeting signals reside within the mature part of the proteins (with the only known exception of Toc75 (13Tranel P.J. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 2093-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar)). Insertion of the overwhelming part of the outer envelope membrane proteins does not require either surface-exposed receptors or energy and has generally been assumed to be accomplished by a spontaneous mechanism or through interaction with the lipid components of the outer membrane (14Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 15Schleiff E. Klösgen R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1541: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Although early work suggested otherwise, the best studied outer membrane proteins are now known to use both proteins within the chloroplast and NTPs for insertion (5Hofmann N.R. Theg S.M.

An emerging concept suggests that multiple types of import complexes could be present within the same cell, each having a unique affinity for different plastid precursor proteins, depending upon the mix of TIC/TOC isoforms it contains. In a recent report, evidence was provided for the existence of distinct plastid import pathways for NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductases A and B (PORA and PORB) (25Reinbothe S. Quigley F.

Rios G. Koncz C. Jarvis P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 2059-2077Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) revealed that different TOC subcomplexes are capable of harboring different precursors. Last but not least, Nada and Soll (28Nada A. Soll J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3975-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) described unusual plastid import characteristics for the inner envelope protein Tic32. This protein is imported into plastids thanks to an uncleavable pre-sequence, and the targeting information is restricted to the N-terminal extremity of this protein. Interestingly, Tic32 import is not dependent on protease-sensitive receptors at the chloroplast surface and does not use the classic TOC machinery to be translated across the outer envelope membrane (28Nada A. Soll J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3975-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Tic32 was also demonstrated to be an essential component in chloroplast biogenesis (29Hormann F. Kuchler M. Sveshnikov D. Oppermann U. Li Y. Soll J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 34756-34762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and, more recently, calcium regulation of chloroplast protein translocation was demonstrated to be mediated by calmodulin binding to Tic32 (30Chigri F. Hormann F. Stamp A. Stammers D.K. Bolter B. Soll J. Vothknecht U.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 16051-16056Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In a previous study (31Miras S. Salvi D. Ferro M. Grunwald D. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47770-47778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), we identified an inner chloroplast envelope quinone-oxidoreductase homologue (ceQORH), which lacks a canonical cleavable N-terminal transit peptide and is, to date, the only known example of an inner envelope protein that contains internal targeting information for import. Here we demonstrate that ceQORH does not embark the trimeric TOC159/75/34 complex during import but uses a novel, proteinaceous, and evolutionarily conserved site. Moreover, molecular dissection of ceQORH has allowed us to identify domains in the polypeptide chain of ceQORH that act concertedly in directing the protein to this hitherto unknown import pathway. Purification of Chloroplast and Chloroplast Subfractions from Arabidopsis—All operations were carried out at 0–5 °C. Percoll-purified chloroplasts were obtained from 200–300 g of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. Crude cell extracts and chloroplast subfractions were purified and stored as previously described (32Ferro M. Salvi D. Brugière S. Miras S. Kowalski S. Louwagie M. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2003; 2: 325-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Protein content of the fractions was estimated using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent (33Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216412) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analyses—SDS-PAGE analyses were performed as described by Chua (34Chua N.H. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 69: 434-436Crossref Scopus (331) Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell). ceQORH and ceQORH fusions were detected using a previously described αceQORH rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the recombinant Arabidopsis ceQORH (31Miras S. Salvi D. Ferro M. Grunwald D. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47770-47778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) at a 1/5000 dilution. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) and GFP fusions were detected using a commercially available αGFP mouse monoclonal antibody (GFP-2A5, Euromedex, 67458 Mundolsheim, France) at a 1/4000 dilution. Construction of Vectors for Stable Expression in Arabidopsis and in Vitro Targeting—A detailed description of the strategies developed to construct the vectors used for stable expression in Arabidopsis and for in vitro import experiments are provided as supplemental test (supplemental data 1 and 2, respectively). Plant Material and Growth Conditions—Arabidopsis plants, Wassilevskija background, were germinated in Petri dishes containing solidified medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 1% (w/v) agarose) for 2 weeks before transfer to soil. Plants were then grown in growth rooms at 23 °C (12-h light cycle) with a light intensity of 150 μmol.m-2.s-1. The Arabidopsis ceqorh mutant (line DRM40) was identified by screening the FLAGdb/FST data base (35Samson F. Brunaud V. Balzergue S. Dubreucq B. Lepiniec L. Pelletier G. Caboche M. Lecharny A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) from the INRA (Versailles, France) collection of T-DNA insertion mutants. These lines, produced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation (36Bechtold N. Ellis J. Pelletier G. CR Acad. Sci. Paris Life Sci. 1993; 316: 1194-1199Google Scholar), were transformed with a T-DNA construct (pGKB5 binary vector) that carries both bar and nptII selection markers (37Bouchez D. Camilleri C. Caboche M. C R Acad. Sci. Paris Life Sci. 1993; 316: 1188-1193Google Scholar). Primary transformants were self-pollinated to obtain plants homozygous for the insertion. Arabidopsis Transformation—Wild-type and transgenic Arabidopsis plants ecotype Wassilevskija background were transformed by dipping the floral buds of 4-week-old plants into an Agrobacterium tumefaciens (C58 strain) solution containing a surfactant (Silwett L-77) according to Clough and Bent (38Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary transformants were selected on Murashige and Skoog medium containing 100 mg.liter-1 kanamycin. Only lines segregating 3:1 for the resistance to kanamycin and expressing the recombinant protein were selected for further analyses. Primary transformants were then self-pollinated to obtain plants homozygous for the insertion. Fluorescence microscopy was performed with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (TCS-SP2, Leica, Deerfield, IL). In Vitro Import Experiments—[35S]Methionine-radiolabeled molecules were synthesized by in vitro transcription/translation (TnT Coupled Wheat Germ Extract Systems, Promega, Madison, WI) of the cDNA clones (as described in supplemental data 2) and added to import mixture (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 330 mm Sorbitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 8.5 mm l-Met) in the presence of Mg-ATP and Mg-GTP at the desired mm concentrations. Seeds of barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Carina) were germinated on moist vermiculite at 25 °C and grown under continuous white-light illumination (30 watts/m2) for 8 days. Chloroplasts were prepared by differential centrifugation and Percoll density gradient centrifugation and were then depleted of energy sources (39Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Holtorf H. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Purified plastids (5 × 107) were then added to the import mixture, and import reactions were performed at various incubation times at 23 °C in the dark. After incubation, plastids were sedimented by centrifugation and treated (when specified) with thermolysin (40Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (5% (w/v) final concentration) and separated by denaturing SDS-PAGE on 11–20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gradients (41Reinbothe S. Krauspe R. Parthier B. Planta. 1990; 181: 176-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and finally radiolabeled molecules were detected by autoradiography. Competitive receptor binding and translocation studies were performed with the indicated radiolabeled precursors. The import mixture was complemented, as indicated, either by 0.25 μm, 2.5 μm, or 25 μm of bacterially expressed unlabeled pSSU, pFd, or Tic32, by 500-fold excesses of pFd or by 150-fold excesses of pPORB and pPORA (42Reinbothe S. Mache R. Reinbothe C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9795-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In this latter case, import experiments were performed using chloroplasts that had been incubated or not with 5-aminolevulinic acid as previously described (39Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Holtorf H. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Plastids were then sedimented by centrifugation and used for import experiments as described above. Quantitative Receptor Binding Studies—The methodology used was that described in Friedman and Keegstra (43Friedman A.L. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1988; 89: 993-999Crossref Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were isolated, and depleted of ATP, as described (44Theg S.M. Bauerle C. Olsen L.J. Selman B.R. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6730-6736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were then incubated at 4 °C with 0.1 mm Mg-ATP, and increasing concentrations of the radiolabeled ceQORH::GFP and (60–100)-ceQORH::GFP. After a 15-min incubation in the dark and a subsequent step of centrifugation, the numbers of plastid-bound ceQORH:: GFP and (60–100)-ceQORH::GFP molecules recovered in the sediment fractions and of nonbound precursor molecules present in the supernatant fractions were determined (43Friedman A.L. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1988; 89: 993-999Crossref Google Scholar) and plotted as a function of the total precursor concentrations in the assays (45Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17805) Google Scholar). Cross-linking Experiments—Cross-linking with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) (40Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 46Tokatlidis K. Junne T. Moes S. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Kronidou N. Nature. 1996; 384: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was performed by activating the cysteine residues in ceQORH::GFP and (60–100)-ceQORH::GFP and incubating the derivatized proteins with isolated plastids in the presence of Mg-ATP and Mg-GTP, as given in the text. Protein was recovered from the different samples by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid (5% (w/v) final concentration), resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10–20% (w/v) polyacrylamide gradients under reducing or nonreducing conditions (46Tokatlidis K. Junne T. Moes S. Schatz G. Glick B.S. Kronidou N. Nature. 1996; 384: 585-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and detected by autoradiography. In Vitro Import of ceQORH into Isolated Chloroplasts—In vitro-import experiments were performed with ceQORH, which had been synthesized by coupled in vitro-transcription/translation of a respective cDNA clone. The 35S-labeled protein was incubated with isolated barley chloroplasts. As control, the small subunit precursor of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (pSSU) was used. Although 35S-pSSU was rapidly imported and processed to mature size (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–4), 35S-ceQORH did not undergo a proteolytic maturation during incubation (Fig. 1B, lanes 1–5). At first glance this result suggested that ceQORH was not imported. When chloroplasts were re-isolated after import and treated with thermolysin, however, ceQORH was easily detectable in a protease-resistant, plastid-bound form (Fig. 1B, lanes 6–10). Moreover, in the absence of chloroplasts, 35S-ceQORH was degraded by the protease validating its protease-sensitivity (Fig. 1C, ceQORH, lanes 1–3). These observations revealed that ceQORH had been imported but without detectable proteolytic cleavage, a result that is consistent with our previous work (31Miras S. Salvi D. Ferro M. Grunwald D. Garin J. Joyard J. Rolland N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47770-47778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). ceQORH Uses a Novel Pathway to Cross the Outer Envelope— We next tested whether the trimeric TOC159/75/34 complex was involved in chloroplast import of ceQORH. In a first set of experiments, in vitro-import experiments were carried out in the presence or absence of chemical amounts (corresponding to large, 150-fold excesses of bacterially expressed and purified, unlabeled pSSU or pFd). Both precursors have previously been demonstrated to use the TOC159/75/34 import machinery for uptake (47Perry S.E. Buvinger W.E. Bennett J. Keegstra K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11882-11889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48Schnell D. Blobel G. Pain D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3335-3342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As internal control, import of 35S-pSSU was tested in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor. In fact, this control verified that no import of 35S-pSSU was detectable in the presence of excess pSSU and pFd. This is evident from (i) the lack of protease-protected precursor after incubation and (ii) the lack of processed, mature SSU (Fig. 2A, lanes 2–3 and 7–8). By contrast, import of 35S-ceQORH in chloroplasts (presented in Fig. 1B) occurred in the presence of excess pSSU and pFd competitors (Fig. 2B, panels a and b, lane 9). As a control, the same competition experiment was reproduced in the presence of excess pFd competitor using “minus competitor” and “plus competitor” conditions in the same experiment (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3ceQORH and Tic32 do not use the same import site into chloroplasts. 35S-ceQORH and 35S-Tic32 were synthesized in vitro and added to incubation mixtures containing 2 mm Mg-ATP and the indicated 0.25 μm, 2.5 μm, and 25 μm concentrations of bacterially expressed unlabeled ceQORH, Tic32, or pFd, used as competitors. The concentration of 0.25 μm ferredoxin in the incubation mixture was obtained using 35S-pFd (lane 13). Mock incubations lacked competitor. At time zero (lanes 1, 6, 11, and 16) and after 15 min (lanes 2–5, 7–10, 12–15, and 17–20) the reactions were stopped on ice. Plastids were repurified on Percoll and supplemented with thermolysin (Thl) to degrade non-imported protein, as indicated. Proteins were detected by auto-radiography following SDS-PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a second set of experiments, isolated barley chloroplasts were preincubated with antibodies directed against the TOC components Toc75 (the translocation channel of the outer envelope) or Toc159 (the major receptor at the outer envelope) (49Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and were then used for new import experiments (Fig. 2C). The preincubation of plastids with antibodies raised against Toc159 strongly affects pSSU binding to plastid surface (Fig. 2C, panel b, lane 5) and leads to the inhibition of the pSSU import into plastids (Fig. 2C, panel b, lane 6). Similarly, although the preincubation of plastids with antibodies raised against Toc75 did not largely affect pSSU binding to plastid surface (Fig. 2C, panel b, lane 8), these antibodies obstructed the translocation channel of the outer envelope, and therefore, strongly inhibited the pSSU import into plastids (Fig. 2C, panel b, lane 9). Finally, although preincubation of plastids with antibodies raised against Toc159 and Toc75 strongly affected the import of pSSU, the same pretreatment did not abolish the ceQORH import into plastids (Fig. 2C, panel a, lanes 6 and 9). As control, preincubation of plastids with pre-immune serum did not affect both the pSSU and the ceQORH import into plastids (Fig. 2C, panels a and b, lane 3). The lack of competition using excess of pSSU and pFd, as well as the lack of antibody blocking indicated that ceQORH did not utilize Toc159 and Toc75 for import. Evidence for the operation of distinct import sites was previously reported for the chloroplast import of PORA and PORB (42Reinbothe S. Mache R. Reinbothe C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9795-9800Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 25Reinbothe S. Quigley F. Gray J. Schemenewitz A. Reinbothe C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant J. 2005; 42: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Results, shown in supplemental Fig. S1, established that 35S-ceQORH import into chloroplasts is not affected in the presence of excess pPORA and hence did not involve the recently discovered protochlorophyllide-dependent translocon (25Reinbothe S. Quigley F. Gray J. Schemenewitz A. Reinbothe C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2197-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in a recent report, Nada and Soll (28Nada A. Soll J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3975-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported on import of another transit-sequenceless inner envelope protein, Tic32, into isolated chloroplasts. Competition experiments were used to address the question of whether ceQORH and Tic32 would share the same import pathway or not (Fig. 3). In a first set of experiments, bacterially expressed and purified Tic32 of Arabidopsis thaliana was added to import reactions containing 35S-ceQORH. Three different competitor concentrations were used: 0.25 μm, 2.5 μm, and 25 μm. In all three cases no competition occurred (Fig. 3, lanes 6–10). Vice versa, import of 35S-Tic32 was insensitive to an excess of bacterially expressed ceQORH (Fig. 3, lanes 16–20). Controls proved that either radiolabeled precursor was sensitive to an excess of the respective unlabeled protein (Fig. 3, lanes 1–5; and data not shown). Because import of 35S-ceQORH also occurred in the presence of excess ferredoxin (which is well known to utilize the standard protein import machinery containing Toc159 (51Pinnaduwage P. Bruce B.D. J.

We next asked whether the ceQORH import site may be (a) of proteinaceous nature and (b) universally conserved in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants species. We therefore performed import experiments with purified plastids isolated form wheat, spinach, and A. thaliana and pretreated or not with thermolysin, a protease which degrades surface-exposed outer envelope proteins, including receptors facing the cytosol (53Joyard J.

Even though they lack antennal N-acetylglucosamine residues, the biosynthesis of these glycans requires the sequential action of GlcNAc transferase I, Golgi mannosidase II, and, finally, β-N-acetylglucosaminidases. In Drosophila, the recently characterized enzyme encoded by the fused lobes (fdl) gene specifically removes the non-reducing N-acetylglucosamine residue from the α1,3-antenna of N-glycans. In the present study, we examined the products of five β-N-acetylhexosaminidase genes from Caenorhabditis elegans (hex-1 to hex-5, corresponding to reading frames T14F9.3, C14C11.3, Y39A1C.4, Y51F10.5, and Y70D2A.2) in addition to three from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtHEX1, AtHEX2, and AtHEX3, corresponding to reading frames At1g65590, At3g55260, and At1g05590). Based on homology, the Caenorhabditis HEX-1 and all three Arabidopsis enzymes are members of the same sub-family as the aforementioned Drosophila fused lobes enzyme but either act as chitotriosidases or non-specifically remove N-acetylglucosamine from both N-glycan antennae. The other four Caenorhabditis enzymes are members of a distinct sub-family; nevertheless, two of these enzymes displayed the same α1,3-antennal specificity as the fused lobes enzyme. Furthermore, a deletion of part of the Caenorhabditis hex-2 gene drastically reduces the native N-glycan-specific hexosaminidase activity in mutant worm extracts and results in a shift in the N-glycan profile, which is a demonstration of its in vivo enzymatic relevance. Based on these data, it is hypothesized that the genetic origin of paucimannosidic glycans in nematodes, plants, and insects involves highly divergent members of the same hexosaminidase gene family.

The N-linked oligosaccharides of invertebrates and plants display a number of features not observed in those of vertebrates (1Wilson I.B.H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar); the presence of immunogenic moieties such as core α1,3-fucose and β1,2-xylose is widespread in “lower” multicellular organisms, as is the tendency for core modified N-glycans to have mannose residues at the non-reducing termini. These oligosaccharides based on a trimannosyl core (see, e.g. the so-called MM, MMF6, or MMXF3 structures shown in Scheme 1) 2All glycan abbreviations are defined in Scheme 1. have been named “paucimannosidic” or “truncated” to distinguish them from oligomannosidic, hybrid, and complex N-glycans; particularly the latter are seen as a hallmark of mammals and other vertebrates. The reactions resulting in the biosynthesis of complex N-glycans in mammals have been well characterized (2Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3776) Google Scholar) and begin with the transfer of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 by oligosaccharyltransferase, followed by both removal and addition of glycan residues. As summarized in Scheme 2, key events in mammalian N-glycan biosynthesis are the sequential actions of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase I (GlcNAc-TI; EC 2.4.1.143) and Golgi mannosidase II (EC 3.2.1.114), whereby the N-acetylglucosamine residue transferred to the α1,3-antenna by GlcNAc-TI is retained in the finally processed glycan. A simplistic explanation of the origin of paucimannosidic glycans in invertebrates and plants would be that truncated glycans, as in some protozoans (3Samuelson J. Banerjee S. Magnelli P. Cui J. Kelleher D.J. Gilmore R. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 1548-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), are transferred by oligosaccharyltransferase. However, it has been shown that plants and insects synthesize the full Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 structure (4Hori H. Elbein A.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1983; 220: 415-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Parker G.F. Williams P.J. Butters T.D. Roberts D.B. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 58-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, various knock-outs show that normal glycan processing in these species is, as in mammals, dependent on the action of GlcNAc-TI (6Sarkar M. Leventis P.A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N.

Also, genes encoding GlcNAc-TI and GlcNAc-TII are known to be present in plants, insects, and nematodes (6Sarkar M. Leventis P.A. Silvescu C.I. Reinhold V.N. Schachter H. Boulianne G.L. J. Biol.

J. 1999; 16: 787-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Thus, to explain the “paradox” that the residue transferred by GlcNAc-TI is absent in many of the N-glycans isolated from invertebrates and plants, whereas, e.g. core fucose, is present, the concept of a “processing” hexosaminidase in these lower eukaryotes must be invoked. Some years ago, a membrane-bound hexosaminidase was enriched from a microsomal fraction of insect cells (21Altmann F. Schwihla H. Staudacher E. Glössl J. März L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17344-17349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This enzyme specifically removed the GlcNAc transferred by Glc-NAc-TI; recently, a member of the glycoside hydrolase family 20, encoded by the Drosophila melanogaster fused lobes (fdl) gene was verified to possess such an enzymatic activity and be localized within the secretory pathway (22Léonard R. Rendić D. Rabouille C. Wilson I.B.H. Préat T. Altmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4867-4875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). A similar activity was also found in Caenorhabditis elegans microsomes (23Zhang W. Cao P. Chen S. Spence A.M. Zhu S. Staudacher E. Schachter H. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); on the other hand, plants are assumed to have nonspecific vacuolar hexosaminidases, which trim any terminal GlcNAc residue (24Vitale A. Chrispeels M.J. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, unlike in insects, this trimming does not take place in the Golgi or secretory pathway, and, therefore, secreted plant glycoproteins such as lac-case contain extended structures with “Lewis a” epitopes (25Fitchette-Lainé A.C. Gomord V. Cabanes M. Michalski J.C. Saint Macary M. Foucher B. Cavelier B. Hawes C. Lerouge P. Faye L. Plant J. 1997; 12: 1411-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The genetic origin of the nematode and plant hexosaminidase activities has remained unknown. To investigate the hexosaminidases of both nematodes and plants (specifically Caenorhabditis elegans and Arabidopsis thaliana) in more detail, we set out to examine their family 20 glycoside hydrolases. A total of five nematode and three plant hexosaminidase cDNAs was engineered for expression of soluble forms of the corresponding proteins in the yeast Pichia pastoris. Whereas two A. thaliana hexosaminidases possessed the expected plant-type “random” specificity for terminal GlcNAc residues, it was found that two members of the novel nematode hexosaminidase subfamily removed specifically the α1,3-antennal GlcNAc residue from N-glycans. Thus, it appears that non-orthologous members of glycosidase family 20 are responsible for the appearance of paucimannosidic or truncated N-glycans in insects, plants, and nematodes. Cloning and Expression of Hexosaminidase Homologues-Total RNA was prepared from a mixed population of C. elegans (wild-type N2) with TRIzol (Invitrogen) reagent and subjected to reverse transcription using Superscript III (Invitrogen) with T18 as primer. Partial reading frames of hexosaminidase cDNAs suitable for soluble expression in P. pastoris were generated by PCR using Expand polymerase with C. elegans cDNA and the primers: CeHex1/1/PstI (aaactgcaggcagagacgacccgga) with CeHex1/2/KpnI (ggggtaccttaaagctctgtcttcgttg), CeHex2/1/PstI (aaactgcaggacatatgacctcatcatacccg) with CeHex2/2/SacII (tccccgcggtcatttcttgattgggaaatgc), CeHex3/1/PstI (aactgcagagttcaaatcgacgacaact) with CeHex3/2/KpnI (gggtacctatgtacaagttttttcgctt), CeHex4/1/PstI (aactgcagccaatgatcgatccagttat) with CeHex4/2/KpnI (gggtacctcaattagtaatctctgttc), and CeHex5/1/PstI (aactgcaggacaaaggtctatagttcattttg) with CeHex5/2/KpnI (ggggtacctcacctccggaaccacg). For isolation of the full open reading frames, the forward primers CeHex1/5 (atgcgacttttaattcccatac), CeHex2/5 (atgttcccgatgcggtgta), CeHex3/5 (atgcttcgaggttttttcgg), CeHex4/5 (atgcataaaatgtcgaaactc), and CeHex5/5 (atgtgcaacatttttcagattg) were used in conjunction with the aforementioned reverse primers, and the fragments were subcloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, USA) and sequenced. In the case of the A. thaliana hexosaminidases, partial cDNAs were cloned after reverse transcription-PCR of TRIzol-extracted RNA from the Columbia ecotype with the primers AtHex1/1/EcoRI (cggaattcatagagaggttgaggatt) with AtHex1/2/XbaI (gctctagatcactgagcgagacaagaac), AtHex2/1/EcoRI (cggaattctcgccggctgattctcct) with AtHex2/2/XbaI (gctctagatcactgagcatagcaagagc), and AtHex3/1/EcoRI (cggaattcaacatttggccaaagccg) with AtHex3/2/XbaI (gctctagattattgatcttgaagagcacc). The cDNA fragments were purified from the PCR reactions using the GFX DNA purification kit (GE Healthcare). Both fragment and vector were digested with the relevant restriction enzymes prior to ligation of the fragments into pPICZαB or -C, either in the form purchased from the supplier (Invitrogen) or in a form in which the vector was modified by inverse PCR to include a region encoding a FLAG tag just upstream of the multiple cloning site but downstream of the region encoding the Ste13 signal cleavage site. Ligation products were transformed into Escherichia coli TOP10F′ prior to selection on zeocin, plasmid preparation, and sequencing. The expression vectors were linearized and transformed into P. pastoris (GS115 strain), colonies were selected on Zeocin, and expression was performed with methanol induction at 16 or 30 °C as previously described (26Bencúrová M. Rendić D. Fabini G. Kopecky E.M. Altmann F. Wilson I.B.H. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 413-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). N-terminally FLAG-tagged forms of the C. elegans hexosaminidases HEX-1, HEX-3, and HEX-4 were detectable after Western blotting using the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1:10,000) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000).

Hexosaminidase Assays-Total nematode extracts were prepared as previously described from wild-type or mutant C. elegans (28Paschinger K. Rendić D. Lochnit G. Jantsch V. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol.

Cao P. Chen S. Spence A.M. Zhu S. Staudacher E. Schachter H. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crude supernatants of P. pastoris expressing recombinant C. elegans and A. thaliana hexosaminidases, as well as ammonium sulfate fractions (between 50 and 90% saturation) of these supernatants, were also assayed using a range of enzymatic assays. The majority of the recombinant enzymes were stable for several months at either 4 °C or -80 °C but not at -20 °C. A supernatant of Pichia expressing C. elegans Golgi mannosidase II was prepared during a previous study (10Paschinger K. Hackl M. Gutternigg M. Kretschmer-Lubich D. Stemmer U. Jantsch V. Lochnit G.

For the standard assay with p-nitrophenylglycosides, 5 μl of sample was incubated in a microtiter well with 25 μl of McIl-vaine citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 3.5–8.0), 2.5 μl of 100 mm p-nitrophenylglycoside in Me2SO, and 17.5 μl of water for 1 h at 37 °C; in some cases, diluted enzyme was used to attain linear substrate turnover over a period of up to 2 h. The reaction was stopped by addition of 250 μl of 0.4 m glycine-NaOH, pH 10.4, and the A405 was read using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader.

Glycans were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (Ultraflex Tof/Tof, Bruker-Daltonics, Bremen, Germeny) using a 6-aza-2-thiothymine matrix (5 mg/ml 6-aza-2-thiothymine in H2O) either in the MS or MS/MS mode. Normally 100–500 shots were summed. For external calibration, a peptide standard mixture (Bruker) was used. Tissue-specific Promoter Analysis-The 2000 bp upstream of the ATG start codon of each C. elegans hex gene was isolated by PCR from genomic DNA using Expand polymerase and the following primer pairs: CeHex1/prom3/BamHI (cgggatcctaatcataataaggcttcgaac) with CeHex1/prom4/BamHI (cgggatccatcaccttaacttcatagatg), CeHex2/prom5/BamHI (cgggatccggcaattttatgatctatggta) with CeHex2/prom6/BamHI (cgggatccatttttttacatttgaggctaa), CeHex3/prom1/BamHI (cgggatccgagtatcacttcccgtcc) with CeHex3/prom2/BamHI (cgggatccatggcgacgtttattgca), CeHex4/prom11/BamHI (cgggatccggtttgccgttaacgttt) with CeHex4/prom8/BamHI (cgggatccattattgtatttgtattgtacaa), and CeHex5/prom9/BamHI (cgggatcctggaatttccatagcctg) with CeHex5/prom10/BamHI (cgggatccataatcataatcaaaaaagattaaa). The reporter plasmid used was a modified form of the pPD95.67 (L2459) promoterless gfp vector modified, as previously described (10Paschinger K. Hackl M. Gutternigg M. Kretschmer-Lubich D. Stemmer U. Jantsch V. Lochnit G. Wilson I.B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28265-28277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), by insertion of a HindIII/XbaI fragment carrying the unc-119 gene into its multiple cloning site to generate pPD95.67/unc-119. PCR fragments and the vector were digested with BamHI and ligated. Selected clones were sequenced and verified to contain the expected upstream regions in the correct orientation and were used to transform unc-119 (ed3) mutants with a particle gun (Bio-Rad). Individuals from integrated lines were examined by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS SP2) with argon laser excitation at 488 nm and emission 500–540 nm using an HC Plans 10×/25 occular and HC PL Fluotar 63×/0.30 objective. Identification of Hexosaminidase Homologues in C. elegans and A. thaliana-Examination of the genome of C. elegans allows prediction of five putative hexosaminidases (T14F9.3, C14C11.3, Y39A1C.4, Y51F10.5, and Y70D2A.2), which we define as HEX-1, HEX-2, HEX-3, HEX-4, and HEX-5, respectively. These proteins have been defined in the CAZy data base (32Coutinho P.M. Henrissat B. Gilbert H.J. Davies G. Henrissat B. Svensson B. Recent Advances in Carbohydrate Bioengineering. 1999: 3-12Google Scholar) as being members of glycoside hydrolase family 20; based on actual cloning of the cDNAs, they are predicted to be of Mr 55,000–70,000 and contain potential N-glycosylation sites. Indeed, HEX-1 was proven in a large survey of glycoproteins to be glycosylated at positions 351 and 460, whereas HEX-5 is glycosylated in vivo at position 218 (33Fan X. She Y.M. Bagshaw R.D. Callahan J.W. Schachter H. Mahuran D.J. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 952-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Kaji H. Saito H. Yamauchi Y. Shinkawa T. Taoka M. Hirabayashi J. Kasai K Nat. Biotech. 2003; 21: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). HEX-2, HEX-3, and HEX-5 also have dibasic motifs just N-terminal of the single hydrophobic domain, suggestive of a Golgi localization or, at least, export from the endoplasmic reticulum (35Giraudo C.G. Maccioni H.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3753-3766Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whereas HEX-1 has a C-terminal KTEL sequence, which could, of course, be a variant of the typical endoplasmic reticulum (KDEL) retrieval sequence. The three A. thaliana hexosaminidase sequences identified in this study were previously included in the CAZy data base (36Henrissat B. Coutinho P.M. Davies G.J. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 47: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar); we hereby define them as AtHEX1 (At1g65590), AtHEX2 (At3g55260), and AtHEX3 (At1g05590). All three genes encode proteins of Mr ∼ 60,000 with five predicted, generally non-conserved, N-glycosylation sites and N-terminal hydrophobic regions, which may constitute signal sequences or transmembrane domains; AtHEX2 has been identified in a proteomic study as being a vacuolar resident (37Carter C. Pan S. Zouhar J. Avila E.L. Girke T. Raikhel N.V. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3285-3303Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), whereas both AtHEX1 and AtHEX3 are predicted by the WoLF PSORT program to have a vacuolar localization. AtHEX1 and AtHEX2 are 51% identical at the amino acid level, whereas AtHEX3 is more distantly related and displays only 29% identity to AtHEX1. Interestingly, the rice genome contains not only two genes homologous to the AtHEX1/AtHEX2 “pair” but also two genes homologous to AtHEX3. The Hexosaminidase Family 20 Has Two Major Branches-To align the hexosaminidase-related protein sequences from a variety of species, which appear not to be globally related but are only similar to one another in certain, narrow regions, the DIALIGN alignment program (27Morgenstern B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W33Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) had to be employed. Standard alignment algorithms (e.g. ClustalW using BLOSUM30 or PAM matrices) under a variety of conditions failed to align the conserved regions of the sequences. Using DIALIGN, a His/Asn-Xaa-Gly-Ala/Cys/Gly/Met-Asp-Glu-Ala/Ile/Leu/Val sequence was found in all sequences (see Fig. 1A). The glutamate residue of this motif corresponds to the general acid/base involved in the catalytic mechanism of hexosaminidases (38Hou Y. Vocadlo D.J. Leung A. Withers S.G. Mahuran D. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2201-2209Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1B) suggests that the nematode HEX-1 belongs to the same sub-family as the human lysosomal α and β subunits and the plant AtHEX1, AtHEX2, and AtHEX3; this sub-family also includes three sequences (Hexo1, Hexo2, and Fdl) from D. melanogaster (22Léonard R. Rendić D. Rabouille C. Wilson I.B.H. Préat T. Altmann F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4867-4875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) as well as ascomycete hexosaminidases such as Penicillium NagA (39Diez B. Rodriguez-Saiz M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2005; 242: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Indeed, C. elegans HEX-1 and AtHEX1 display 36–38% identity over ∼500 residues to the human hexosaminidase α and β subunits, respectively. On the other hand, the other four C. elegans hexosaminidase homologues (see also supplemental data for an alignment) can be grouped together with one sequence each from D. melanogaster, mouse, and man; members of this subfamily poorly align with the human and plant sequences. The six selected bacterial sequences, such as the well studied Streptomyces plicatus SpHex (40Mark B.L. Vocadlo D.J. Knapp S. Triggs-Raine B.L. Withers S.G. James M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10330-10337Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), also clearly associate with one or the other subfamily (Fig. 1A), suggestive of an ancient origin for the two branches. Expression of Recombinant Caenorhabditis and Arabidopsis Hexosaminidase Homologues-cDNA fragments encoding the putative luminal domains of each C. elegans and A. thaliana hexosaminidase homologue (i.e. lacking putative cytosolic and transmembrane domains) were engineered into Pichia expression vectors as non-tagged and/or FLAG-tagged forms. In the case of the nematode HEX-1, HEX-3, and HEX-4, both Coomassie staining and anti-FLAG Western blotting of crude supernatants and ammonium sulfate fractions indicated expression of proteins of Mr 80,000, 70,000, and 55,000, respectively; HEX-2 was only ever detected after SDS-PAGE by Coomassie staining (Mr ∼ 60000), and it was considered possible that the FLAG tag was removed by proteolysis, potentially at dibasic sites in the stem region. The expression of HEX-5 was, however, apparently below the detection limits of Western blotting and Coomassie staining, although a number of independent clones reproducibly showed an activity absent from control “empty vector” supernatants. AtHEX1, AtHEX2, and AtHEX3 were seen as FLAG-tagged bands of ∼Mr 65000 in either 50% or 70% ammonium sulfate fractions of the supernatants of recombinant yeast (data not shown). The initial enzymatic tests were performed with artificial chromogenic substrates (p-nitrophenyl-β-N-acetylgalactosaminide and p-nitrophenyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide) and showed that the homologues were indeed enzymatically active and that no enzyme activity was present in the supernatants of Pichia transfected with empty vector. Whereas HEX-1 was approximately equally active toward both substrates, HEX-2, HEX-3, HEX-4, and HEX-5 were most active (or only active) toward p-nitrophenyl-β-N-acetylgalactosaminide (see also Fig. 2); the latter hexosaminidases are, indeed, other than the Streptococcus pneumoniae StrH enzyme (41Clarke V.A. Platt N. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8805-8814Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), the first members of a new sub-division of family 20 to be enzymatically studied. The Km value of HEX-1 for p-nitrophenyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide was estimated to be 1.1 mm, which can be compared with a previously reported value of 0.45 mm with 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide for a hexosaminidase activity in crude C. elegans extracts (42Bolanowski M. Jacobson L.A. Russell R.L. Mech. Aging Dev. 1983; 21: 295-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The plant hexosaminidases AtHEX1, AtHEX2, and AtHEX3 were active with p-nitrophenyl-β-N-acetylglucosaminide as substrate (see also Fig. 3) but displayed only a minor activity toward p-nitrophenyl-β-N-acetylgalactosaminide (data not"

Recent studies have implicated cholesterol-rich, lipid raft microdomains in survival signals mediated by Akt1. Here we address the role of lipid raft membranes as a potential site of intersection of androgenic and Akt1 signaling. A subpopulation of androgen receptor (AR) was found to localize to a lipid raft subcellular compartment in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Endogenous AR interacted with endogenous Akt1 preferentially in lipid raft fractions and androgen substantially enhanced the interaction between the two proteins. The association of AR with Akt1 was inhibited by the anti-androgen, bicalutamide, but was not affected by inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). Androgen promoted endogenous Akt1 activity in lipid raft fractions, in a PI3K-independent manner, within 10 min of treatment. Fusion of a lipid raft targeting sequence to AR enhanced localization of the receptor to rafts, and stimulated Akt1 activity in response to androgen, while reducing the cells' dependence on constitutive signaling through PI3K for cell survival. These findings suggest that signals channeled through AR and Akt1 intersect by a mechanism involving formation within lipid raft membranes of an androgen-responsive, extranuclear AR/Akt1 complex. Our results indicate that cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains play a role in transmitting non-genomic signals involving androgen and the Akt pathway in prostate cancer cells.

Yao H.H. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2006; 17: 223-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). AR also plays a role in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer (PCa), including progression to the androgen-independent state and metastasis (2Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar, 3Cinar B. Koeneman K.S. Edlund M. Prins G.S. Zhau H.E. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7310-7317PubMed Google Scholar). Upon androgen binding, the AR undergoes conformational changes and translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus (4Tyagi R.K. Lavrovsky Y. Ahn S.C. Song C.S. Chatterjee B. Roy A.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1162-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), where the receptor-hormone complex regulates the expression of target genes (5Brinkmann A.O. Blok L.J. de Ruiter P.E. Doesburg P. Steketee K. Berrevoets C.A. Trapman J. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 307-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar).In addition to this well recognized genomic function, AR has been demonstrated to activate intracellular signaling pathways by a rapid (occurring in minutes) non-genomic process activated in response to hormonal stimulation (6Lutz L.B.

The mechanisms underlying the non-canonical pathways involving the AR and other nuclear receptors are still poorly understood, however, possible nongenomic roles for the AR have been described (8Migliaccio A.

Another report showed that cells treated with 17β-estradiol (E2) or androgen resulted in cell proliferation mediated by the rapid formation of a cytosolic signaling complex containing estrogen receptor-α or -β (ERα or ERβ (depending on the cell type)), AR, and the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src (8Migliaccio A. Castoria G. Di Domenico M. de Falco A. Bilancio A. Lombardi M. Barone M.V. Ametrano D. Zannini M.S. Abbondanza C. Auricchio F. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5406-5417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Kousteni et al. (9Kousteni S. Bellido T. Plotkin L.I. O'Brien C.A. Bodenner D.L. Han L. Han K. DiGregorio G.B. Katzenellenbogen J.A. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Roberson P.K. Weinstein R.S.

Membrane-associated AR was also shown to regulate the activity of both ERK and Akt in C6 glial cells (13Gatson J.W. Kaur P. Singh M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2028-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The recent demonstrations of membrane- or cytoplasm-initiated rapid androgenic signals from several groups indicate that one or more AR signaling pathways exist in parallel with the genomic pathway in some physiologic settings (14Freeman M.R. Cinar B. Lu M.L. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 273-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).Akt (protein kinase B) is a component of the PI3K/Akt/PTEN/mTOR signaling pathway (15Davies M.A. Koul D.

Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 2547-2553Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and consists of three paralogs with very similar structure and enzymatic properties: Akt1, Akt2, Akt3. Akt1 is the prototypical member of this family (16Nicholson K.M. Anderson N.G. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 381-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Activation of phosphoinositide 3′-kinase (PI3K) generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (18Carpenter C.L. Cantley L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1288: M11-M16PubMed Google Scholar), which in turn binds to the pleckstrin homology domain of Akt, resulting in recruitment of the kinase to the cell membrane (19Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). Upstream kinases phosphorylate Akt (Akt1) at Thr308 and Ser473, resulting in full activation of the enzyme (20Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar).Studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that epidermal growth factor receptor activation of Akt mediates cell survival signaling in LNCaP PCa cells, in part, through cholesterol-enriched membrane domains (21Zhuang L. Kim J. Adam R.M. Solomon K.R. Freeman M.R. J. Clin. Investig. 2005; 115: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 22Zhuang L. Lin J. Lu M.L. Solomon K.R. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2227-2231PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol-rich membranes, generally referred to as “lipid rafts,” exhibit a liquid-ordered structure and are insoluble in non-ionic detergents (23Waugh M.G. Minogue S. Anderson J.S. dos Santos M. Hsuan J.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts sequester and exclude certain types of signaling proteins and are thought to act as membrane platforms for signal transduction (24Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar). Caveolae, membrane structures that harbor caveolin proteins, are a form of lipid raft (24Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5110) Google Scholar, 25Couet J. Belanger M.M. Roussel E. Drolet M.C. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2001; 49: 223-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Although considerable heterogeneity has been found in lipid rafts isolated from different cell backgrounds (26Pike L.J. J. Lipid Res. 2003; 44: 655-667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar), signaling through lipid rafts does not require the presence of caveolins, which regulate many signal transduction proteins, particularly kinases, by direct binding (22Zhuang L. Lin J. Lu M.L. Solomon K.R. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2227-2231PubMed Google Scholar). A previous study demonstrated that enforced expression of caveolin-1 in (caveolin-null) LNCaP cells resulted in enhanced ligand-dependent AR transcriptional activity (27Lu M.L. Schneider M.C. Zheng Y. Zhang X. Richie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13442-13451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Enforced expression of AR in PC3 cells was also shown to result in complex formation and co-localization with epidermal growth factor receptor (28Bonaccorsi L. Carloni V. Muratori M. Formigli L. Zecchi S. Forti G. Baldi E. Int. J. Cancer. 2004; 112: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the possibility that either AR itself, or signaling proteins that communicate with the AR, reside in or transit through cholesterol-rich microdomains.Published studies have demonstrated that the treatment of AR-expressing cells with androgen rapidly activates Akt1 in a transcription-independent manner (11Baron S.

This non-genomic signal from AR to Akt was demonstrated to occur as a result of PI3K activation. In the present study, we identify the lipid raft subcellular compartment as a site where AR transmits a PI3K-independent signal to Akt1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmids and Constructs—Hemagglutinin-Myr-Akt was from Dr. Thomas Franke (Columbia University), and T7-Akt was from Dr. William R.

We engineered the pcDNA3.1-p/m-myc/his by inserting double-stranded 5′-phosphorylated DNA containing palmitoylation and myristoylation sequences from the Lck gene into the EcoRV site of the pcDNA3-myc/his vector. pcDNA3-hAR was described previously (30Cinar B.

Bicalutamide (Casodex) was provided by Dr. Leland Chung (Emory University, Atlanta, GA).Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitations—Cell fractionations were performed according to published methods (22Zhuang L. Lin J. Lu M.L. Solomon K.R. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2227-2231PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, and complete protease inhibitors or phosphatase inhibitor, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentrations were determined by standard methods (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, cleared protein lysates were incubated with an appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. Antibody-antigen complexes were collected on Protein A- or G-Sepharose, and immune complexes were washed three times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and blocked either with PBST (0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) skim milk powder (pan-specific antibodies) or PBST containing 5% BSA (Sigma) (phospho-specific antibodies). Following incubation with primary antibodies, membranes were incubated with species-specific secondary antibodies, and proteins were visualized using the SuperSignal chemiluminescence system and exposure of membranes to film.Cell Cultures and Transfections—RPMI medium was used for LNCaP, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was used for HEK 293 and COS cells. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and cells were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Where appropriate, complete serum-free RPMI medium was used in all experimental conditions. Cell transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions with some modifications. Stable transfections were performed as described (3Cinar B. Koeneman K.S. Edlund M. Prins G.S. Zhau H.E. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7310-7317PubMed Google Scholar).Density Gradient Analysis and Cholesterol Measurement—Monolayer cells treated with androgen (R1881) or vehicle (EtOH) for 10 min were washed with PBS, followed by lysis in TNET buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, and complete protease inhibitors). Cell lysis was performed on ice for 30 min. Lysates were passed through a 21-gauge syringe 12 times to break up the DNA. Lysates were cleared by (3000 × g) centrifugation at 4 °C for 10 min. Ice-cold OptiPrep reagent was added to cleared lysates to obtain 40% OptiPrep/sample mixture in a 1-ml volume. The samples were placed at the bottom of ultracentrifuge tubes, and then layered with 30, 20, 10, and 5% OptiPrep solution, 1 ml each. OptiPrep solutions were prepared in TNET buffer. Samples were centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 18 h using a swinging bucket rotor (MLS-50). Fractions were collected from the top. To measure cholesterol content, cholesterol was extracted adding equal volumes of phenol into sample (1:1 ratio), mixed, and centrifuged. The bottom phase was collected; phenol extractions were repeated three times, and the final extracts were washed two times with water. Cholesterol extracts were obtained by removing phenol in a SpeedVac (SPD1010, Thermo Savant). The cholesterol pellet was eluted with cholesterol reagent (Thermo Scientific, Inc.). Cholesterol content (pink color) was determined at A490 nm).Immunocytochemistry and Microscopy—LNCaP, COS, or HEK 293 cells were plated on 8-well tissue culture slides (BD Biosciences) at 70% confluence. Individual wells were transfected with either 100 ng of pcDNA3-hAR or p/m-hAR. In a separate experiment, LNCaP cells were also plated on 8-well tissue culture chamber slides at 70% confluence. Following transfection, cells were starved 24 h and incubated with 1 nm R1881 for 10 min where appropriate. Cells were labeled in serum-free growth media at 4 °C for 30 min with 20 ng/ml of FITC- or 10 ng/ml Alexa Fluor 594-CTB to visualize lipid rafts. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and incubated with anti-phospho-Akt1 (Ser473) antibody (1:100 dilutions) followed by goat anti-rabbit Cy3 antibody (1:1000 dilutions). Sequential labeling with anti-AR monoclonal antibody diluted at 1:100 and Cy5 goat anti-mouse diluted at 1:2000 was used to detect AR. Nuclei were visualized with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole containing mounting media (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Cells were imaged at ×63 with a Plan-Apochromat oil immersion lens on either an Axioplan 2 Apotome epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Germany) equipped with Axiovision 4.4 and 4.5 software or an LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss) with LSM 510 Browser software.Kinase and Apoptosis Assays—For in vitro Akt kinase reactions, Akt immune complexes were mixed with a reaction mixture containing an Akt substrate (H2B; 1 μg/reaction), 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 100 μm unlabeled ATP were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction mixture was mixed with sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. Apoptosis or cell death assays were performed using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science).Statistical Analysis—For biochemical and biological experiments, values are expressed as mean ± S.D. Where appropriate, a t test was conducted to assess the significance of differences between treatments. Statistical significance was determined at p ≤ 0.05.RESULTSAR Is Present Within Lipid Raft Membranes—We initially sought to determine whether Akt1 (hereafter Akt) could be rapidly activated by androgen in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells. Serum-depleted LNCaP cells were incubated with the AR agonist R1881 (1 nm) for varying times (0, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min). Akt activation, as assessed by measurement of phosphorylation at the Ser473 site, was stimulated by androgen in a time-dependent manner. Akt activation was evident as early as 5-10 min of treatment (Fig. 1A). To study the potential role of lipid raft membranes in this signaling event, we determined whether AR was present in Triton X-100-insoluble, octylglucoside-soluble biochemical fractions, which are enriched in lipid raft components (22Zhuang L. Lin J. Lu M.L. Solomon K.R. Freeman M.R. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2227-2231PubMed Google Scholar, 31Solomon K.R. Mallory M.A. Finberg R.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 325-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Triton X-100-soluble (TS) and Triton X-100-insoluble/octylglucoside-soluble (TI) fractions were isolated from LNCaP cells in log-phase growth, and the distribution of AR within these fractions was examined by Western blot. The results (Fig. 1B, upper panel) showed that substantial levels of AR partition into the TI fraction under these conditions. Correct partitioning of the lipid raft protein marker, Gαi2, into the raft fractions confirmed the integrity of the biochemical fractionation (Fig. 1B, lower panel).We next examined the effect of androgen on AR localization to the TI fraction. Serum-depleted LNCaP cells were treated with androgen for varying times (0, 15, 30, and 60 min), and the relative levels of AR partitioning into TI and TS fractions were assessed (Fig. 1C). Although the majority of AR was found in the TS fraction, substantial levels of AR were detected in the TI fraction at time 0, and levels of AR partitioning into lipid raft fractions were enhanced further by androgen. AR in the TI fraction reached a maximum 15 min following androgen treatment, with no significant difference in AR levels seen between 15 and 60 min. Western blots for β-tubulin and Gαi2, markers for cytosol/non-raft membrane and lipid raft membrane, respectively, showed no cross-contamination between the fractions (Fig. 1C, lower panels). A similar result was obtained using HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with wild-type (WT) human AR (supplemental Fig. S1).To verify the above findings, LNCaP cells were treated with androgen or vehicle for 10 min, and lipid raft fractions were isolated by gradient ultracentrifugation (32Korzeniowski M. Kwiatkowska K. Sobota A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5358-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Raft fractions in the gradient were identified by immunoblots of gradient fractions with antibodies against the raft markers Gαi2 (Fig. 2A, lower panel) and flotillin-2 (not shown). In response to androgen, AR accumulated in Gαi2-containing fractions (Fig. 2A). These results are largely in agreement with the data obtained using the successive detergent extraction method, although endogenous AR in the raft material obtained from gradient preps was more difficult to detect in the unstimulated condition by immunoblotting. Gαi2-reactive fractions contained high levels of cholesterol, verifying the cholesterol-rich nature of the raft material (Fig. 2B). Immunofluorescence cell staining of AR along with the Alexa Fluor 594-CTB labeling of GM1, a lipid raft-resident ganglioside, revealed that the AR co-localizes with the raft marker in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Taken together, these observations indicate that AR resides at lipid raft membranes and this association is enhanced within minutes in the presence of androgen.FIGURE 2Analysis of AR in density gradient fractions. A, Western blots of AR in gradient fractions. LNCaP cells grown in the absence of serum were treated with vehicle (EtOH) or R1881 (1 nm) for 10 min. Cell lysates were collected in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and subjected to OptiPrep (Sigma) density gradient centrifugation. Fractions were collected from the top of the gradient. Western blots of AR and Gαi2 were performed to assess the amount of AR in raft membranes (predominantly fractions 5 and 6). B, the levels of cholesterol in the indicated fractions from “A.” Cholesterol measurement was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C and D, immunofluorescence of AR along with the Alexa Fluor 594-CTB labeling of GM1 in LNCaP cells treated with vehicle (EtOH) or R1881 (1 nm) for 10 min in a serum depleted condition. Alexa Fluor 594-CTB conjugate was used to stain the lipid raft marker GM1 (red). AR was detected using FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit (green) secondary antibody. Co-localization of AR and GM1 are evident in the absence of androgen (yellow). Nuclei (blue) are stained with 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). These micrograph images are the representative of multiple images from at least three different experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)AR and Akt Interact in Lipid Rafts—A subpopulation of Akt is present in lipid rafts of LNCaP cells (22Zhuang L.

Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6238-6246Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This observation, along with previous studies indicating that AR and Akt can assemble into the same multiprotein complex (27Lu M.L. Schneider M.C. Zheng Y. Zhang X. Richie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13442-13451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Wen Y. Hu M.C. Makino K. Spohn B. Bartholomeusz G. Yan D.H. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6841-6845PubMed Google Scholar), suggest the hypothesis that AR and Akt may interact within lipid raft membranes. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that endogenous AR and Akt1 could be co-precipitated with anti-Akt1 specific antibody (IG1) from LNCaP cells (Fig. 3A). The AR/Akt interaction within lipid raft fractions was markedly stimulated by androgen treatment (Fig. 3A). Complex formation between AR and Akt was also seen by co-immunoprecipitation (IP) in total cell lysates from HEK 293 cells that were transiently co-transfected with AR and T7-Akt1 expression constructs and treated with androgen or vehicle control (Fig. 3B). To investigate whether Akt activity is required for the kinase to interact with the AR, two kinase-inactivation mutants (20Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) were analyzed in AR/Akt co-transfected HEK 293 cells. Both mutants interacted in an indistinguishable manner from the wild-type form, indicating that Akt activation is not required for complex formation (Fig. 3C). To determine whether AR and Akt interact directly, we carried out an in vitro binding experiment. Increasing amounts (0, 200, 400, and 800 ng) of pre-activated Akt1 recombinant protein were reconstituted with AR immune complex from LNCaP cells, and the presence of Akt1 in the precipitated complex was assessed by anti-Akt1 antibody. We observed that pre-activated Akt physically interacted with AR in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3AR/Akt complexes in Triton-X-100-insoluble fractions. A, AR/Akt complexes form principally in detergent-insoluble fractions in LNCaP cells. Cells were treated with R1881 (1 nm) or vehicle (EtOH). Cell fractionation was performed at 60 min post-treatment. AR/Akt complexes were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Akt antibody (IG1). Western blots were probed with AR or total Akt antibody.

Paradoxically, heme is also toxic at high concentrations and is capable of killing S. aureus. To maintain cellular heme homeostasis, S. aureus employs the coordinated actions of the heme sensing two-component system (HssRS) and the heme regulated transporter efflux pump (HrtAB). HssRS-dependent expression of HrtAB results in the alleviation of heme toxicity and tempered staphylococcal virulence. Although genetic experiments have defined the role of HssRS in the heme-dependent activation of hrtAB, the mechanism of this activation is not known. Furthermore, the global effect of HssRS on S. aureus gene expression has not been evaluated. Herein, we combine multivariable difference gel electrophoresis with mass spectrometry to identify the heme-induced cytoplasmic HssRS regulon. These experiments establish hrtAB as the major target of activation by HssRS in S. aureus. In addition, we show that signaling between the sensor histidine kinase HssS and the response regulator HssR is necessary for growth of S. aureus in high concentrations of heme. Finally, we show that a direct repeat DNA sequence within the hrtAB promoter is required for heme-induced, HssR-dependent expression driven by this promoter and that phosphorylated HssR binds to this direct repeat upon exposure of S. aureus to high concentrations of heme. Taken together, these data establish the mechanism for HssRS-dependent expression of HrtAB and, in turn, provide a functional understanding for how S. aureus avoids heme-mediated toxicity.

Staphylococcus aureus is a commensal organism that, upon breeching surface colonization sites, is capable of infecting virtually any tissue of the human body. Hence, it is likely that staphylococci can sense and respond to distinct environmental cues and stressors, which change upon the transition from commensal colonizer to invading pathogen. Consistent with this supposition, S. aureus has been shown to alter gene or protein expression upon changes in cell density, pH, oxidative stress, nutrient and oxygen availability, as well as upon heat and cold shock and growth in the presence of the iron source heme (1Bronner S. Monteil H. Prevost G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 2Cheung A.L. Bayer A.S. Zhang G. Gresham H. Xiong Y.Q. FEMS Immunol. Med.

Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 4275-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). A primary mechanism by which S. aureus mediates these changes in gene expression is through the elaboration of two-component systems (TCS) 4The abbreviations used are: TCStwo-component systemIsdiron-regulated surface determinantsHtsheme transport systemHssRSheme sensor system response regulator (R) and sensor kinase (S)HrtABheme-regulated ABC transporter ATPase (A) and permease (B)2D-DIGEtwo-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis.4The abbreviations used are: TCStwo-component systemIsdiron-regulated surface determinantsHtsheme transport systemHssRSheme sensor system response regulator (R) and sensor kinase (S)HrtABheme-regulated ABC transporter ATPase (A) and permease (B)2D-DIGEtwo-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis. (1Bronner S. Monteil H. Prevost G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). TCS typically sense signals through a membrane-localized histidine kinase, which undergoes autophosphorylation at a specific histidine residue upon recognition of a ligand or other appropriate signal. The phosphorylated histidine kinase then transphosphorylates an aspartate residue of its cognate response regulator (8Mascher T. Helmann J.D. Unden G. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2006; 70: 910-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated response regulators bind to the promoters of the genes that they regulate, often leading to enhanced target gene expression. Through this mechanism, bacteria use TCS to translate external signals into changes in gene expression programs, facilitating responses to environmental stimuli. Although S. aureus has a number of characterized and uncharacterized TCS, the signals that activate the sensor kinases of these systems, the molecular details of phosphorelay, and the target DNA sites to which activated response regulators bind are incompletely defined (1Bronner S. Monteil H. Prevost G. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 183-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).S. aureus undergoes a dramatic alteration in protein expression in response to depletion of nutrient iron (6Friedman D.B. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Whitwell C.W. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This programmed response is necessitated by the role of iron as a cofactor for enzymes involved in many cellular processes, including nucleotide biosynthesis, aerobic respiration, and protection against reactive oxygen species (9Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 10Bullen J.J. Griffiths E. Iron and Infection: Molecular, Physiological and Clinical Aspects, John Wiley and Sons, New York. 1999; Google Scholar). The requirement for iron in essential biochemical processes makes it a nutrient that pathogenic bacteria must acquire in the context of infection (10Bullen J.J. Griffiths E. Iron and Infection: Molecular, Physiological and Clinical Aspects, John Wiley and Sons, New York. 1999; Google Scholar). However, free iron is a limiting nutrient for invading bacteria due to the fact that most mammalian iron is sequestered by iron-binding proteins such as the iron transport protein transferrin, the iron storage protein ferritin, and the oxygencarrying and -storing proteins hemoglobin and myoglobin. In these latter two proteins, iron is found stably chelated at the center of the porphyrin ring of heme and is thus inaccessible to most bacteria. Nevertheless, the fact that the majority of the iron within the human body is in the form of heme establishes it as a potential source of iron for pathogenic bacteria (11Deiss A. Semin. Hematol. 1983; 20: 81-90PubMed Google Scholar).S. aureus is able to satisfy its nutrient iron requirement by acquiring heme from hemoglobin, a process vital to staphylococcal infection (12Torres V.J.

Staphylococcal heme acquisition is accomplished through cell wall-anchored, membrane-bound, and cytoplasmic proteins of the Isd and Hts loci (15Reniere M.L. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. Biometals. 2007; 20: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The concerted actions of the Isd and Hts systems free heme from hemoglobin, shuttle it across the bacterial cell wall, transport it through the membrane and into the cytoplasm, and cleave the porphyrin ring to release free iron (13Skaar E.P.

Biometals. 2007; 20: 333-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar).Heme is a challenging molecule for biological systems to metabolize due to its propensity to generate reactive oxygen species, damage membranes, and peroxidate lipids (16Everse J. Hsia N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1075-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Although heme as well as its oxidized form hemin represent a valuable iron source for S. aureus, high concentrations of hemin or other metalloporphyrins are toxic to the bacterium (17Torres V.J. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Bezbradica J.S. Gordy L.E. Iturregui J. Anderson K.L. Dunman P. Joyce S. Skaar E.P.

Drugs. 2001; 10: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, S. aureus is capable of undergoing an adaptive response to growth in the presence of hemin (6Friedman D.B. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Whitwell C.W. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 17Torres V.J. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Bezbradica J.S. Gordy L.E. Iturregui J.

Pre-exposure of staphylococci to a sub-toxic concentration of hemin confers resistance to what would otherwise be a lethal level of hemin. This adaptive response is facilitated by the sensing of hemin through the two-component heme sensor system (HssRS) (17Torres V.J. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Bezbradica J.S. Gordy L.E. Iturregui J. Anderson K.L. Dunman P. Joyce S. Skaar E.P. Cell Host & Microbe. 2007; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Upon exposure of S. aureus to hemin, HssRS increases transcription of the genes encoding the heme-regulated transporter efflux pump (HrtAB), a bicistronic ABC-type transporter involved in the alleviation of hemin toxicity (17Torres V.J. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Bezbradica J.S. Gordy L.E. Iturregui J. Anderson K.L. Dunman P. Joyce S. Skaar E.P. Cell Host & Microbe. 2007; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Interestingly, S. aureus mutants in hrtAB display increased hepatic virulence and an amplified hemin-induced secretion of virulence factors (17Torres V.J. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Bezbradica J.S.

This highlights the importance of hemin sensing and adaptation in S. aureus pathogenesis. Although HssRS has been identified as a regulatory system that is critical to staphylococcal hemin sensing and involved in pathogenesis, the complete hemin-dependent HssRS regulon has not been described. Furthermore, the mechanism by which HssRS activates hrtAB expression in a hemin-dependent manner has not been elucidated.In this report, we investigate the mechanism of signaling and gene regulation by HssRS. We present evidence that hrtAB is the major target of HssRS upon exposure of S. aureus to hemin. Furthermore, we show that signaling between the sensor histidine kinase HssS and the response regulator HssR is essential for the adaptive response to hemin. We also demonstrate that phosphorylated HssR binds to a direct repeat DNA sequence within the hrtAB promoter when bacteria encounter exogenous hemin. These studies directly connect HssRS with the adaptive response to hemin and reveal the functional details of a newly identified S. aureus TCS. The conservation of hrtAB and hssRS across a variety of Gram-positive organisms that associate with vertebrate blood makes these findings applicable to numerous bacterial pathogens.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Plasmids—S. aureus strain Newman (20Duthie E.S.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 587-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), after which they were electroporated into appropriate electrocompetent secondary recipients (23Schenk S. Laddaga R.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1992; 73: 133-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2D-DIGE—Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) was performed on triplicate samples of cytoplasmic extract from S. aureus wild type or an isogenic ΔhssR mutant grown for 15 h at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm in the presence or absence of 5 μm hemin. Samples were prepared, labeled, and resolved, and individual protein features with altered expression patterns were identified as described (6Friedman D.B. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Whitwell C.W. Torres V.J. Skaar E.P. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).Purification of HssR and HssS—The entire hssR open reading frame and the signaling domain of hssS (corresponding to amino acids 185–457) were cloned into the E. coli expression plasmid pET15b, making pET15b.hssR and pET15b.hssS for the expression of hexahistidine N-terminal fusions of both proteins. Pfu mutagenesis (24Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) was used to create expression constructs for the mutants HssR:D52A and HssS:H249A. pET15b.hssR:D52A and pET15b.hssS:H249A were verified by sequencing (Vanderbilt University DNA sequencing facility). For all protein expression, E. coli BL-21(DE3) harboring each plasmid was subcultured 1:100 from 15-h cultures into terrific broth at 37 °C with shaking at 225 rpm until the A600 of the culture reached 0.3. Growth temperature was then switched to 16 °C for 1 h, and expression was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.2 mm). After an additional 20 h of growth at 16 °C, bacteria were harvested, and recombinant proteins were purified by nickel affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Purified proteins were dialyzed and stored at –20 °C.In Vitro Phosphorelay—70 μl of HssS or HssS:H249A labeling reaction was prepared (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm KCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 20 μm ATP, 5 μm HssS or HssS:H249A). 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Biosciences) was added to both labeling reactions, and samples were incubated at 37 °C. At 5, 15, and 45 min after the addition of radiolabeled ATP, 10-μl samples were removed and mixed with 2× SDS loading buffer. At 45 min, HssR or HssR:D52A were added to the appropriate reactions to a final concentration of 17.5 μm. 10-μl samples were taken 5, 15, and 45 min after the addition of HssR or HssR:D52A. Samples were loaded onto 15% polyacrylamide gels, and, after SDS-PAGE, gels were dried and analyzed using a PhosphorImager.XylE Reporter Constructs/hrtAB Promoter Truncations and Mutations—Construction of phrtAB.xylE has been described previously (17Torres V.J. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Bezbradica J.S. Gordy L.E. Iturregui J. Anderson K.L. Dunman P. Joyce S. Skaar E.P. Cell Host & Microbe. 2007; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A reporter construct in which the xylE gene is controlled by the S. aureus lipoprotein diacylglycerol transferase (lgt) promoter (25Bubeck Wardenburg J. Williams W.A. Missiakas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13831-13836Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was made by removing an NdeI site from xylE by Pfu mutagenesis (24Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Schoettlin W. Cline J. Mathur E. Bauer J.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar) and cloning xylE lacking an NdeI site into pOS1plgt (25Bubeck Wardenburg J. Williams W.A. Missiakas D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 13831-13836Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) between the NdeI and BamHI sites of this vector, making plgt.xylE. Using phrtAB.xylE as a template, five truncations were made in the hrtAB promoter by PCR amplification using 5 different 5′ primers, which anneal to sites within the hrtAB promoter and a 3′ primer matching the 3′-end of xylE. These promoter-xylE fragments were inserted into pOS1 (26Schneewind O. Model P. Fischetti V.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 267-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), making phrtAB.xylE.T1–5. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing from the 5′-end of the hrtAB promoter to the 3′-end of xylE. Four residues within the direct repeat sequence upstream of the hrtAB start site were mutated by PCR SOEing (27Horton R.M. Cai Z.L. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar). phrtAB.xylE with four direct repeat base mutations (phrtAB.xylE.DR) was confirmed by sequencing as above.Complementation Constructs—A plasmid containing a copy of hssR under the control of its native promoter was created by PCR-amplifying hssR with its promoter using S. aureus Newman genomic DNA as a template and inserting amplified DNA into pOS1, making phssR. A plasmid containing a copy of hssS under the control of the lgt promoter was created by PCR-amplifying hssS and inserting amplified DNA into pOS1plgt, creating phssS. A C-terminal c-myc-tagged hssR was created by PCR-amplifying hssR from S. aureus genomic DNA using a 5′ primer within the hssR promoter and a 3′ primer matching the 3′-end of hssR and including the coding sequence for the c-myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL). Amplified DNA was inserted into pOS1, creating phssR-myc. A C-terminal c-myc-tagged hssS was created in the same manner as for hssR. Amplified DNA was inserted into pOS1plgt, generating phssS-myc. The hssRmyc D52N mutation and the hssS-myc H249A mutation were introduced as described above for the generation of E. coli expression constructs, generating phssR-myc:D52N and phssS-myc:H249A. Mutations were confirmed, and secondary mutations were ruled out by sequencing. Expression of tagged HssS and HssR was tested by preparing bacterial extracts and immunoblotting as follows. For HssR-Myc, 15-ml cultures of bacteria grown for 15 h were centrifuged, washed with wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), and lysed in 800 μl of lysis buffer (wash buffer containing two complete protease inhibitor tablet per milliliter (Roche Diagnostics)) by mechanical disruption using a FastPrep 24 (MP Biomedicals). For HssS-Myc, bacteria were grown and washed as above. Bacteria were then resuspended in TSM (100 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 500 mm sucrose, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 μg/ml lysostaphin) and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and protoplasts were harvested by centrifugation. Protoplasts were re-suspended in 800 μl of lysis buffer as above and were sonicated. Triton X-100 was added to 1%, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and supernatant was removed for analysis. 30 μg of lysate from HssR-Myc or HssS-Myc expressing S. aureus was subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with sc-789 polyclonal rabbit anti-c-Myc primary (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and AlexaFluor-680-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary (Invitrogen) antibodies. Membranes were dried and scanned using an Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).S. aureus Growth Kinetics—15-h cultures of S. aureus grown in the presence or absence of 2 μm hemin were diluted 1:75 into 150 μl of fresh medium with or without 10 μm hemin in triplicate on a 96-well round-bottom cell culture plate. Cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm, and absorbance values were determined at the indicated times after inoculation. All spectrophotometry was performed using a Cary 50 MPR microplate reader coupled to a Cary 50 Bio UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc.).XylE Activity Assay—Appropriate strains were grown overnight at 37 °C with shaking at 180 rpm and were then subcultured into fresh media for 3 h. Bacteria were then dispensed into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing hemin dilutions and were grown for 2 h. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared and reporter activity was determined as previously described (17Torres V.J. Stauff D.L. Pishchany G. Bezbradica J.S. Gordy L.E. Iturregui J. Anderson K.L. Dunman P. Joyce S. Skaar E.P. Cell Host & Microbe. 2007; 1: 109-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Magnetic Bead Pulldown Assay—For capture of HssR-Myc from S. aureus extracts, S. aureus harboring phssR-myc was subcultured 1:100 from an overnight culture into 100 ml of Tryptic soy broth with or without 7 μm hemin. Bacteria were grown for 7 h at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm and were then pelleted, washed with 20 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and re-suspended in 20 ml of TSM for 30 min. Bacterial protoplasts were then pelleted, resuspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2), and lysed by French press. Mechanically sheared salmon sperm DNA was added to lysates to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml. Bead-DNA complexes were prepared by adding 5 μg of biotinylated 300-bp hrtB coding sequence DNA or hrtAB promoter DNA prepared by PCR using a 5′-biotinylated primer to 500 μg of Dynabeads M-280 streptavidin (Dynal Biotech) in 400 μl of bead binding and wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA) and rotating on a rotisserie at room temperature for 15 min. DNA-bead complexes were washed three times in 1 ml of bead binding and wash buffer, re-suspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer, and added to 5 ml of S. aureus extract. Mixtures were rotated for 30 min at room temperature, and DNA-bead complexes were washed four times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and eluted with 50 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. For oligonucleotide elution experiments, DNA-protein-bead complexes were prepared using extracts from hemin-treated S. aureus as above and were eluted in increasing concentrations (0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 12.5 μm) of double-stranded oligonucleotides dissolved in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and prepared by allowing complementary 40-mer corresponding to the wild-type (AAAAACAATTGTTCATATTGAGTTCATATTTCAACCTTAT) or mutant (AAAAACAATTGTACATATAGAGATCTTATTTCAACCTTAT) hrtAB direct repeat to cool to room temperature from 90 °C. Samples from triplicate experiments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. For quantification, band intensities were determined using Odyssey Infrared Imaging System software (LI-COR Biosciences). For each elution series, band intensities were adjusted for background intensity, summed, and each band intensity was expressed as a percentage of the sum. For pulldown assay of in vitro phosphorylated purified HssR, 200 μl of phosphorylation reactions was prepared by incubating 1 μm HssR or HssR:D52A in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2 with or without 20 μm potassium acetyl phosphate for 2 h at 37 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 2 min to remove precipitated protein, and 10 μl of soluble protein was removed for SDS-PAGE analysis. 25 μl of bead-DNA complexes prepared as described above were added to 75 μl of soluble protein in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. Samples were rotated on a rotisserie at room temperature for 15 min, after which beads were washed four times and eluted with 50 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using an anti-hexahistidine tag antibody as described for the detection of c-myc-tagged proteins.RESULTShssRS Is Required for Hemin-induced Expression of HrtA—S. aureus uses hemin as a nutrient iron source, and hemin-iron acquisitio"
https://openalex.org/W2041374621,"Various pathological processes are accompanied by release of high amounts of free heme into the circulation. We demonstrated by kinetic, thermodynamic, and spectroscopic analyses that antibodies have an intrinsic ability to bind heme. This binding resulted in a decrease in the conformational freedom of the antibody paratopes and in a change in the nature of the noncovalent forces responsible for the antigen binding. The antibodies use the molecular imprint of the heme molecule to interact with an enlarged panel of structurally unrelated epitopes. Upon heme binding, monoclonal as well as pooled immunoglobulin G gained an ability to interact with previously unrecognized bacterial antigens and intact bacteria. IgG-heme complexes had an enhanced ability to trigger complement-mediated bacterial killing. It was also shown that heme, bound to immunoglobulins, acted as a cofactor in redox reactions. The potentiation of the antibacterial activity of IgG after contact with heme may represent a novel and inducible innate-type defense mechanism against invading pathogens.

Heme is a pivotal molecule for prokaryote and eukaryote organisms. As a prosthetic group of different proteins, it performs versatile biological functions, e.g. oxygen transport and storage, oxygen activation, and electron transport. The characteristics that make heme a key component of the aerobic metabolism (easy acceptance or donation of electrons by the iron ion) also make it inherently dangerous. Heme is redox-active and when liberated from hemoproteins may induce or aggravate the oxidative stress (1Darley-Usmar V. Halliwell B. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 1996; 13: 649-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 2Kumar S. Bandyopadhyay U. Toxicol. Lett. 2005; 157: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Heme could be released in large amounts as a result of many pathological conditions such as hemolysis, rhabdomyolysis, hemoglobinopathies, ischemia/reperfusion, malaria, severe inflammation, etc. (2Kumar S.

Usually under these conditions, the systems that protect the organism from free heme toxicity are saturated, and high plasma concentrations of this pro-oxidative molecule are reached (more than 20 μm). Heme, when liberated from its protein-bound state, may interact and oxidize lipids (9Camejo G. Halberg C. Manschik-Lundin A. Hurt-Camejo E. Rosengren B. Olsson H. Hansson G.I. Forsberg G.B. Ylhen B.

Chem. 1983; 258: 12069-12072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Free heme is also implicated in the catalytic nitration of tyrosine residues of proteins in a number of pathological conditions (14Bian K. Gao Z. Weisbrodt N. Murad F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5712-5717Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 15Thomas D.D. Espey M.G. Vitek M.P. Miranda K.M. Wink D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12691-12696Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In addition to its pro-oxidative potential, it has been found that free heme also possesses potent pro-inflammatory activity. In vivo it induces increase in the vascular permeability, an increase in the expression of the adhesion molecules on the endothelial cells, and leukocyte recruitment to the organs (6Wagener F.A.

Furthermore, it was shown that the transient exposure of neutrophils to heme triggers the oxidative burst and delays spontaneous apoptosis (17Graca-Souza A.V. Arruda M.A. de Freitas M.S. Barja-Fidalgo C. Oliveira P.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 4160-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 18Arruda M.A. Rossi A.G. de Freitas M.S. Barja-Fidalgo C. Graca-Souza A.V. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 2023-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) Heme also acts as a potent chemoattractant for neutrophils in vitro and in vivo (17Graca-Souza A.V. Arruda M.A. de Freitas M.S. Barja-Fidalgo C. Oliveira P.L. Blood. 2002; 99: 4160-4165Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In addition, heme possesses potent mitogenic activity for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and increases the expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interferon-γ from these cells (19Stenzel K.H. Rubin A.L. Novogrodsky A. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 2469-2473PubMed Google Scholar, 20Novogrodsky A. Suthanthiran M. Stenzel K.H. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3981-3987PubMed Google Scholar). Because of its pro-oxidative and pro-inflammatory properties, free heme is implicated in the pathogenesis of many disease conditions such as acute renal failure after hemolysis, tissue injury induced by ischemia/reperfusion, as well as chronic inflammation that could be observed in some hemolytic diseases (6Wagener F.A. Volk H.D. Willis D. Abraham N.G. Soares M.P. Adema G.J. Figdor C.G. Pharmacol. Rev. 2003; 55: 551-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 7Balla J. Vercellotti G.M. Nath K. Yachie A. Nagy E.

Immunoglobulins are the main serum glycoproteins responsible for detection and destruction of pathogens or their products. In disease conditions accompanied by the release of large amounts of heme from hemoproteins Igs could be exposed to high concentrations of this molecule. This may influence their biological functions. Indeed, it has been observed recently that the in vitro exposure of polyclonal antibodies from healthy individuals to heme resulted in the appearance of new strong reactivities toward various autoantigens (22McIntyre J.A. Thromb. Res. 2004; 114: 579-587Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23McIntyre J.A. Wagenknecht D.R. Faulk W.P. J. Autoimmun. 2005; 24: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24McIntyre J.A. Wagenknecht D.R. Faulk W.P. Autoimmun.

Immunol. 2007; 65: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects on heme on the antigen binding activity of Igs are not understood. It is also not clear what is the biological significance of the interaction of the heme with the Igs. In an attempt to address these questions and because of the importance of such studies for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of diseases accompanied by release of heme, this study was undertaken. Our results demonstrated that an exposure of antibodies to heme resulted in a substantial increase in their binding to bacterial antigens. Kinetic, thermodynamic, and spectroscopic analyses revealed that antibodies have an intrinsic property to bind heme and to use it for acquiring promiscuous antigen binding. It was also found that this caused more efficient pathogen elimination by complement. The heme-mediated broadening of the antibody repertoire may provide an inducible innate-like defense against invading pathogens. However, it may also contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation and autoimmunity.

Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis—The kinetic constants of the interactions between native or hematin-exposed monoclonal antibodies were determined by using a surface plasmon resonance BIAcore 2000 (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Purified mouse IgG2a (clone IP2-11-1) was immobilized on research grade CM5 sensor chip (Biacore) using amino-coupling kit as described by the manufacturer (Biacore). After that, the monoclonal IgG2a antibody solutions in 5 mm maleate, pH 4, with final concentrations of 25, 10, or 5 μg/ml, were injected with a flow rate of 10 μl/min and a contact time of 7 min on the surfaces of three independent flow cells. All the experiments were performed using HEPES-buffered saline (0.01 m HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% polysorbate) as running buffer and sample dilution buffer. All solutions were filtered through 0.22-μm filters and degassed under vacuum. Concentrations ranging from 37.5 to 600 nm of the native or 5 μm hematin-exposed Z2 antibody were injected on the immobilized monoclonal IgG2a with flow rate of 10 μl/min. Association phase was monitored for 10 min and then the chip surfaces were exposed to running buffer for 10 min to monitor the dissociation phase. For the regeneration of the chip surface, a3 m solution of potassium thiocyanate (Sigma) was used. All kinetic measurements were performed at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 °C. The binding to the surface of the control flow cell was always subtracted from the binding to the antigen-coated cells. The details of surface plasmon resonance measurements of the interactions of 77IP52H7 antibody with FVIII are given in the supplemental Experimental Procedures. BIAevaluation version 4.1 software (Biacore) was used for the calculation of the kinetic rate constants of association and of dissociation. Analysis was performed by global analysis of the experimental data using the kinetic models, included in the software, fitting the data with lowest value of χ2. The values of the equilibrium dissociation constant were determined as the result of the ratio between the kinetic rate constants (KD = koff/kon). The evaluation of the thermodynamic parameters of the interactions of Z2 antibody was described under the supplemental Experimental Procedures. Determination of the Salt Concentration Dependence of the Kinetic Rate Constants—The salt concentration dependence of the kinetic rate constants of native and of hematin-exposed Z2 were determined by using BIAcore. For this, the kinetic measurements were performed consecutively in variants of phosphate buffer (5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, and 0.005% Tween 20) differing by the NaCl concentrations(0, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mm). The native and hematin-exposed Z2 antibodies were diluted in various buffers to concentrations ranging from 18.75 to 300 nm and injected on the immobilized monoclonal IgG2a with a flow rate of 20 μl/min. Association times of 5 min and dissociation times of 10 min were monitored. For the regeneration of the chip surface, a 3 m solution of KSCN was used. All measurements were performed at 25 °C. UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—UV-visible spectroscopic assays for the binding of heme to polyclonal IgG were taken in PBS, pH 7.4, or in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl with Ultraspec 1000 spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences). A stock solution (2.5 mm) of hematin in 0.1 m NaOH was added to the buffer containing IgG (0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, or 1 μm) to a final concentration of 2 μm. After hematin addition, the samples were homogenized and allowed to stand for 5 min at room temperature. The absorption spectra of the solutions were then recorded in wavelength range from 350 to 650 nm. In some cases potassium cyanide or imidazole were added (from 25 mm stock solutions) to buffers containing hematin or IgG-hematin. The absorption spectra of IgG alone in the range 350–650 nm were also recorded. It was found not to be significantly different from the background absorbance of the buffer alone. For titration of binding of heme to IgG, aliquots from a hematin stock solution were added to 1 μm solution of IgG and to reference cuvette containing buffer only. After each addition, samples in two cuvettes were homogenized and incubated for 5 min in dark at 25 °C. Then difference absorption spectra were recorded. The IgG heme binding curve was build by plotting the difference in absorbance (Aheme-IgG – Aheme) at 390 nm versus molar concentrations of heme. For determination of heme binding to Fc-γ or to F(ab′)2 fragments from human pIgG, a stock solution (2.5 mm) of hematin was added to the PBS containing 50 μm F(ab′)2 fragments or 100 μm Fc-γ fragments to a final concentration of 20 μm. Assessment of Peroxidase Activity—For measurement of the peroxidase-like activity of the complexes of hematin with pIgG, 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS) was used as the chromogenic substrate. ABTS was added to 0.1 m phosphate citrate buffer, pH 5, to a final concentration of 1 mm. Samples under study were added to the reaction buffer at quantities resulting in final hematin concentrations of 0.2 or 2 μm. The hydrogen peroxide to a concentration of 6 mm was then added. The peroxidase activities were followed by an increase in absorbance at 414 nm. The measurements were performed in a 1-cm cuvette at 20-s time intervals for at least 600 s. For preparation of the samples, hematin from 2.5 mm stock solution in 0.1 m NaOH was added to PBS alone or to PBS containing pIgG (50 or 100 μm), Fc-γ (50 μm), or F(ab′)2 (50 μm) to final concentrations 10 or 50 μm. In some cases, 10 mm NaN3 was also added. After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, samples were tested for their peroxidase activity as described above. Oxidation of Indigo Carmine by a Metal-catalyzed Oxidation System—Fe(II) ions (from ferrous sulfate) and EDTA were both added in PBS (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) to final concentrations of 100 μm. The reaction buffer also contained 300 μm indigo carmine. Also added to the reaction buffer were pIgG to a final concentration of 10 μm, hematin to a final concentration of 1 μm, or pIgG preincubated with hematin (100 μm pIgG preincubated with 10 μm for 1 h at 25 °C) to final concentrations of 10 μm pIgG and 1 μm hematin. The Fenton reaction was started by addition of hydrogen peroxide to concentration of 1 mm. After 10 min of incubation at 25 °C, the absorption at 610 nm was measured. In some cases reaction buffer contained 200 units/ml CuZn-superoxide dismutase from bovine erythrocytes or 40 units/ml crystalline bovine liver catalase. The redox activity of the pIgG-hematin complex preincubated with 1000-fold molar excess (in relation to hematin) of KCN or NaN3 was evaluated by using the same assay. Bactericidal Activity by Hydrogen Peroxide—In a typical experiment, a culture of ampicillin-resistant Escherichia coli (HB101 strain) (in log phase growth, A600 = 0.2–0.3) was repeatedly pelleted (three times at 3000 rpm) and resuspended in PBS, pH 7.4. The PBS suspended cells were then added to sterile Eppendorf tubes. Pooled human IgG (final concentration 100 μm) was pretreated with hematin at final concentrations of 0, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μm. Control preparations of hematin with the same final concentration but without IgG were also prepared. After 1 h, four series of E. coli were incubated as follows: with IgG (10 μm final concentration), pretreated with increasing hematin concentrations; IgG, pretreated with increasing hematin concentrations in the presence of 0.5 mm H2O2 (this concentration was estimated to cause 50% killing); PBS with increasing hematin concentrations (0–10 μm); PBS with increasing hematin concentrations (0–10 μm) in the presence of 0.5 mm H2O2 for 1 h at 37 °C. Viability of bacteria was assessed by recovery of colony-forming units (CFUs) on agar plates after overnight incubation at 37 °C. Each experiment was performed at least in duplicate. Data are given as percent of the viability of E. coli without any treatment. Bacterial Killing by Complement—E. coli was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with hematin (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 μm)-pretreated pIgG. Subsequently, guinea pig complement (1:100, 1:40, or 1:20 dilutions, or PBS) was added, and again bacteria were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Viability was determined by recovery of CFUs on agar plates after 12 h of incubation at 37 °C. Each experiment was performed in at least duplicate. As a control, the experiment was performed with two different preparations of pIgG, and the results were comparable. Data are given as percent of the viability of E. coli without any treatment. Exposure of Polyclonal IgG to Heme Resulted in Increased Antibody Binding to Foreign Antigens and to Myosin—We first addressed the question whether the heme exposure could influence the ability of antibodies to recognize foreign antigens. Normal human pIgG was briefly incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of hematin, and its ability to interact with bacterial proteins was then evaluated by an immunoblot technique. A significant hematin dose-dependent increase in the binding of pIgG to these antigens was observed (Fig. 1A). Moreover, we tested the ability of hematin-exposed pIgG to bind to intact E. coli cells, immobilized on a solid matrix. A considerable increase in the binding of heme-exposed pIgG to bacteria was detected (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, the appearance of new binding specificities of pIgG for E. coli antigens was detected after exposure to concentrations of heme that were lower than those reached in vivo under certain pathological conditions (3Muller-Eberhard U. Javid J. Liem H.H. Hanstein A. Hanna M. Blood. 1968; 32: 811-815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of secondary antibodies to native or heme-exposed pIgG, immobilized on ELISA plates, did not differ significantly (data not shown). This observation ruled out the possibility that heme treatment of IgG results in enhanced recognition by secondary antibodies. Furthermore, we studied the interaction of heme-exposed pIgG with myosin. A significant increase in the binding of pIgG to this self-protein was detected after exposure to heme (Fig. 1D). Antibodies from native pIgG interacted only negligibly with myosin, whereas the pIgG exposure to even 1 μm hematin resulted in an ∼2-fold increase in the binding. In addition, by using label-free real time interaction measurements, a significant increase in the binding of heme-exposed pIgG or of heme-exposed F(ab′)2 fragments (obtained from pIgG) to human complement factor H was observed (data not shown). To rule out possibility that increased antigen binding activity of IgG is caused by heme-induced IgG multimer formation, size-exclusion chromatography was performed. The exposure of pIgG to hematin, at concentrations that considerably influence antigen binding behavior (2, 10, 20, and 40 μm), did not result in a significant increase in the proportion of IgG dimers or multimers (supplemental Fig. S1A). Moreover, the reactivity of the monomer fraction isolated from hematin-exposed IgG with human factor VIII was considerably higher than that of the monomer fraction from native pIgG (Fig. S1B), as seen in the case of unfractionated IgG (Fig. 1). Kinetic and Thermodynamic Analyses of the Interactions of Heme-exposed IgG—To elucidate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the effects of heme on the antigen-binding properties of antibodies, kinetic and thermodynamic analyses were performed. The characteristics of the interactions of the mouse monoclonal IgG2b antibody Z2 to its cognate antigenmouse IgG2a were deciphered by surface plasmon resonance. The exposure of Z2 to hematin resulted in the appearance of new antigen binding specificities (Fig. 1C). This allows us to use Z2 as a suitable model system for studies on the biophysical mechanisms of heme-induced changes in antigen binding behavior of antibodies. Comparison of the interaction profiles of the native with those of hematin-exposed Z2 antibody revealed a qualitative difference in the interactions with the same antigen between the two forms of the antibody (supplemental Fig. S2A). In contrast, the exposure to hematin of monoclonal antibody 77IP52H7 resulted only in small difference in the interaction profiles (supplemental Fig. S2B). These data clearly indicate that heme does not influence the antigen-binding properties of all antibodies and rule out nonspecific effects of heme on immunoglobulin molecules. The studies of the interactions of Z2 allowed us to determine the binding affinity for the target antigen. The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) measured at 25 °C was 140 nm (±12, n = 3) for the native antibody. The binding affinity of Z2 was increased more than twice after exposure to hematin (to KD value of 56 nm (±10, n = 3)). We then evaluated the effect of temperature on the KD. For the native form of Z2, the correlation between the interaction temperatures and the change in the KD values was not significant (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the values of KD characterizing the binding of the heme-exposed antibody showed significant dependence on the change in the temperature. Interestingly, with increasing temperatures from 5 to 25 °C, 2-fold elevation of the antigen binding affinity of the antibody was observed (Fig. 2A). The value of the equilibrium dissociation constant depends on the values of the kinetic rate constants that describe the dissociation and the association phases of the interaction process. The comparison of the kinetic rate constants of the native and of heme-exposed Z2, measured at 25 °C, revealed that the increased antigen binding affinity after contact with heme was because of both an increase of the association rate constant (kon) and a decrease of dissociation rate constant (koff). Thus, the value of kon for native antibody was 3.60 × 104 m–1 s–1 (±0.24 × 104, n = 3), whereas it was 5.50 × 104 m–1 s–1 (±0.026 × 104, n = 3) for the heme-exposed antibody. The koff values of 5.10 × 10–3 s–1 (±0.126 × 10–3, n = 3) and of 3.11 × 10–3 s–1 (±0.0156 × 10–3, n = 3), respectively, were measured. Furthermore, the temperature dependences of the kinetic rate constants were evaluated. On Fig. 2B Arrhenius plots depict the temperature dependences of the kon and of koff constants, characterizing the interaction of the native and heme-exposed Z2. The rate of association for both forms of the antibody was weakly dependent on temperature change. However, although an increase of the temperature resulted in a decrease of the rate of association of native Z2, a reverse temperature dependence of kon was observed for heme-exposed Z2 (Fig. 2B). It is interesting to note that the rates of association at low temperatures (10 and 15 °C) were slightly slower for heme-exposed Z2 than those for the native one. At higher temperatures the opposite tendency was seen. In contrast to the results for kon, the temperature sensitivity of the dissociation kinetic rate constant was similar for the native and heme-treated antibodies (Fig. 2B). Moreover, at all studied temperatures, the values of koff of the hematin-treated antibody were lower than those of native one. The kinetic measurements performed on surfaces with different quantities of the target antigen or by using different flow rates gave similar values of the kinetic parameters. This rules out a skewing of the kinetic data by effects of the mass transport or by other rebinding artifacts. The activation energies derived from the Arrhenius plots were used to evaluate the changes in the thermodynamic parameters that characterize association, dissociation, and equilibrium phases of the interactions of the native and of hematin-exposed Z2 (Fig. 2C). The change in the entropy term (TΔS) for the association step was with a negative value for the interactions of both forms of the antibody. However, considerable differences were observed in the extent of the change of this parameter. Thus, the unfavorable TΔS of –75.90 ± 1.10 kJ mol–1 for the association of native Z2 was significantly attenuated to –36.34 ± 2.23 kJ mol–1 in the case of the hematin-exposed antibody (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the change in the enthalpy (ΔH) differed qualitatively between both forms of Z2. Although the association ΔH for the native antibody was favorable with a value of –28.96 ± 0.4 kJ mol–1, the change of the same parameter for the heme-treated antibody was unfavorable with a value of 9.58 ± 0.6 kJ mol–1. No significant difference in the change of the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) of association was found between two forms of the Z2. During the dissociation phase, neither of the thermodynamic parameters differed between native and heme-exposed antibody. The value of the changes in enthalpy at equilibrium was favorable for the native antibody and highly unfavorable for the heme-exposed one (–9.66 ± 1.45 and 27.62 ± 4.46 kJ mol–1, respectively). A favorable TΔS at equilibrium was observed to be characteristic for the interactions of both forms of the antibody (TΔS = 36.84 ± 5.60 kJ mol–1, in the case of native antibody, and TΔS = 68.96 ± 11.14 kJ mol–1, in the case of heme-exposed one). This result indicates that the binding of IgG2a by Z2 is essentially an entropy-driven process. No signific"

Here, we show that the protein translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane is required for Bax insertion and cytochrome c release. The release of cytochrome c and other pro-apoptotic proteins from the mitochondrial intermembrane space into the cytosol is a key event in the activation of apoptosis. Once in the cytosol, cytochrome c interacts with APAF-1, in the presence of dATP, to form the apoptosome and trigger the activation of pro-caspase-9 (1Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6261) Google Scholar). Caspase-9 then cleaves and activates procaspase-3, the main executioner caspase. Although cytochrome c-mediated activation of the caspases is regarded as the main outcome of mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, other intermembrane space proteins play additional, independent roles in cell death signaling (2Danial N.N. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 2004; 116: 205-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar). During the early phase of apoptosis, only the mitochondrial outer membrane is permeabilized, whereas other intracellular membranes as well as the plasma membrane remain intact. The mechanism(s) by which the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane have been studied extensively during recent years. A major pathway involves the soluble cytoplasmic proteins Bid and Bax. Upon cleavage of Bid by proteases, e.g. caspase-8, a truncated 16-kDa C-terminal fragment (tBid) 4The abbreviations used are: tBidtruncated 16-kDa C-terminal fragmentCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidTOMtranslocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane is formed, which subsequently can promote the oligomerization/insertion of Bax into the outer mitochondrial membrane (3Luo X.

The C terminus is of critical importance for the pro-apoptotic function of Bax, and it shows some similarity to the signals that normally direct tail-anchored proteins to mitochondria (8Nechushtan A.

One of them involves an interaction of Bax with the mitochondrial porin, also called voltage-dependent anion channel, a β barrel protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane (9Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar). Another claims that cardiolipin, a phospholipid present in the mitochondrial inner membrane and in the contact sites between the two membranes, is important for tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release (10Kuwana T.

In addition, it has recently been reported that Bax interacts via its N terminus with Tom22, a receptor of the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane (TOM) complex (11Bellot G. Cartron P.F.

In this study, we have used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to investigate which proteins in the mitochondrial outer membrane might be responsible for the specific interaction with tBid/Bax. Yeast was instrumental in the discovery of several biologically important mechanisms, which turned out to be highly conserved between yeast and mammalian systems. The straightforward genetics allow the usage of mutants that are not available at a comparable quality in any eukaryotic system. By employing an in vitro system consisting of yeast mitochondria and recombinant proteins, we found that neither cardiolipin nor porin is required for tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release. In contrast, we report that a functional translocase of the outer membrane, the TOM complex, is involved in tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release from yeast as well as mammalian mitochondria. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions, Mitochondrial Preparation-The wild type strain used in this study was W303-A, and the CRD1-mutant and the porin double deletion mutant were described earlier (12Iverson S.L.

Yeast cultures were grown in a lactate medium at 30 °C, except for the strains tom40-4 and tom40-2, and the parental wild type, which were grown at 25 °C.

Recombinant Proteins-Full-length human Bax and human tBid were expressed in Escherichia coli strain (BL21 DE3) as N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged proteins from the vectors pET23Bax and pET23tBid, respectively.

The proteins were dialyzed against 30% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4, and stored at –80 °C. To obtain oligomeric Bax, the recombinant, monomeric Bax was incubated prior to the experiments with 1% octylglycoside for 1 h at 4°C (7Yethon J.A. Epand R.F. Leber B. Epand R.M. Andrews D.W. J.

Cytochrome c Release and Bax Insertion-Isolated mitochondria from yeast or rat liver were incubated in SHKCl-buffer (600 mm sorbitol, 100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4) at a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. To suppress permeability transition of rat liver mitochondria, 1 μm cyclosporin A was present. Recombinant proteins were added at a concentration of 10 nm (tBid) or 150 nm (monomeric Bax), and the suspension was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C; in one series of experiments, incubation was for 1 h at 37°C. Thereafter, the samples were fractionated into supernatant and pellet by centrifugation (15 min, 16,000 × g, 4 °C) and applied to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. To analyze for the insertion of Bax, the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 100 mm sodium carbonate and incubated with continuous shaking at 4 °C for 30 min. Then, the membranes were recovered by centrifugation (30 min, 100,000 × g, 4 °C) and dissolved in loading buffer. Import of Precursor Proteins and Proteinase K Treatment-Precursor proteins were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate (TnT, Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine and imported into isolated mitochondria, essentially as described previously (16Ahting U. Waizenegger T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To remove proteins and protein domains exposed to the outside of mitochondria, the organelles were incubated with 50 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 0 °C. Then, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and the sample was incubated for an additional 5 min. Mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation (10 min, 10 000 × g, 4 °C) and either suspended in loading buffer or used for subsequent experiments. Co-immunoprecipitation of Bax with the Isolated TOM Complex-The TOM core complex of Neurospora crassa strain GR-107 was purified as described (17Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and stored at –80 °C. For co-immunoprecipitation, the purified TOM core complex, as well as Bax and tBid were incubated at the same protein concentration of 15 μg/ml in immunoprecipitation buffer (140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4) for 15 min at 30 °C. The reaction was cleared by centrifugation (15 min, 16,000 × g, 4 °C) and split, and the indicated antibodies were added together with protein G-Sepharose beads. Samples were gently rotated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the immunoprecipitation buffer before bound proteins were eluted with loading buffer without reducing agent. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunodecoration. Co-immunoprecipitation of Bax with the TOM Complex during Protein Insertion-Isolated wild type yeast mitochondria were incubated with Bax and tBid in 140 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm sorbitol, 10 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4 for the indicated time at 4 °C. Mitochondria were lysed directly by the addition of 0.5% CHAPS and cleared by centrifugation (15 min, 16,000 × g, 4 °C) and split, and the indicated antibodies were added together with protein G-Sepharose beads. Samples were gently rotated for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the immunoprecipitation buffer before bound proteins were eluted with loading buffer without reducing agent. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunodecoration. Antibody Competition with Mitochondria and Permeabilized Cells-Bax/Bak double knock-out murine fibroblasts were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of 500 mm sorbitol, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm KPO4, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm succinate, 50 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4. Cells were permeabilized by the addition of 0.01% digitonin. The permeabilized cells were preincubated with polyclonal antibodies against rat Tom20 (a gift from Henry Weiner, Indiana) or porin (Calbiochem) for 30 min on ice. The sample was divided, and one half was treated with the recombinant proteins. The other half was incubated with radiolabeled pSu9-DHFR. The samples were fractionated by centrifugation (15 min, 16,000 × g, 4 °C). Alternatively, yeast mitochondria were incubated in the same way with polyclonal antibodies against yeast Tom20 and Tom22 and tested for cytochrome c release induced by the recombinant proteins. Cytochrome c Release from Isolated Yeast Mitochondria Induced by Recombinant tBid and Bax-To investigate mitochondrial components that might be required for tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release, we decided to use yeast mitochondria as a model system. First, we tested whether yeast mitochondria release cytochrome c in a fashion similar to rat liver mitochondria, when incubated with recombinant, purified proteins. Rat liver mitochondria released no cytochrome c if exposed to monomeric Bax for 15 min at 30 °C. In contrast, treatment with a combination of tBid and monomeric Bax caused substantial cytochrome c release (Fig. 1A), which is in accordance with the notion that monomeric Bax has to be activated by tBid to mediate cytochrome c release. Monomeric Bax induced a minor release of cytochrome c with mitochondria from wild type yeast under similar conditions. However, a combination of tBid and Bax triggered the release of a substantial amount of cytochrome c from these organelles (Fig. 1B). These findings encouraged us to use wild type yeast, and the various mutants available, to study the molecular requirements for tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release. Exposed Domains of Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Proteins Are Not Required for tBid/Bax-induced Cytochrome c Release-To address the question whether domains of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins, which are exposed to the cytosol, are involved in tBid/Bax targeting, we removed such domains by controlled proteinase K treatment of the isolated mitochondria. Thereby, protease-accessible domains of, for example, the receptor proteins Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70, could be removed, whereas integral membrane proteins, such as the β barrel proteins Tom40 and the porins, were not affected (Fig. 1C). When mitochondria were incubated with recombinant tBid and Bax after pretreatment with proteinase K, the amount of cytochrome c released was similar to that in mock-treated mitochondria. Therefore, we concluded that exposed domains of mitochondrial outer membrane proteins are not required for tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release. Notably, it was recently reported that Tom22 may interact with Bax during apoptosis (11Bellot G. Cartron P.F. Er E. Oliver L. Juin P. Armstrong L.C. Bornstein P. Mihara K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 14: 785-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Tom22 recognizes cryptic targeting signals of inner membrane or matrix proteins and is, at least in yeast, not required for the biogenesis of outer membrane proteins. In our system, removal of the cytosolic domain of Tom22 by proteinase K treatment did not influence cytochrome c release. Neither Cardiolipin nor Porin Is Required for tBid/Bax-induced Cytochrome c Release in Yeast-As mentioned above, the uniquely mitochondrial phospholipid, cardiolipin, has been suggested to act as a possible mitochondrial target for tBid in mammalian systems (18Lutter M. Fang M. Luo X. Nishijima M. Xie X. Wang X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that cardiolipin is required for tBid/Bax-induced membrane permeabilization in a reconstituted system containing liposomes and the recombinant proteins (10Kuwana T. Mackey M.R. Perkins G. Ellisman M.H. Latterich M. Schneiter R. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D. Cell. 2002; 111: 331-342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). Using a yeast mutant lacking the gene for cardiolipin synthase, CRD1, we demonstrated earlier that cardiolipin is not required for cytochrome c release induced by treatment with chemically oligomerized Bax (12Iverson S.L. Enoksson M. Gogvadze V. Ott M. Orrenius S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1100-1107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To test whether cardiolipin is required for tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release, mitochondria isolated from this mutant were now incubated with a combination of tBid and Bax. The induced release of cytochrome c was similar to that seen in wild type mitochondria (Fig. 1D, upper panel). Thus, it appears that cardiolipin is not required for cytochrome c release in yeast, which is in line with a recent study in mammalian cells demonstrating that down-regulation of the mammalian cardiolipin synthase by small interfering RNA did not abolish apoptosis signaling via Fas ligation, caspase-8 activation, and Bid cleavage (19Choi S.Y. Gonzalvez F. Jenkins G.M. Slomianny C. Chretien D. Arnoult D. Petit P.X. Frohman M.A. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 14: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Next, we tested whether the mitochondrial porins, the voltage-dependent anion channels, might be required in the release process. It has previously been proposed that these proteins are targets for Bcl-2 family proteins (9Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1928) Google Scholar, 20Cheng E.H. Sheiko T.V. Fisher J.K. Craigen W.J. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2003; 301: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). However, when isolated mitochondria from a yeast strain lacking both porins were incubated with tBid and Bax, the extent of cytochrome c release was similar to that observed with wild type mitochondria (Fig. 1D, lower panel). This finding suggests that the porins are not involved in tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release, at least not in yeast. The Mitochondrial TOM Complex Is Required for tBid/Bax-induced Cytochrome c Release-Next, we tested whether other mitochondrial β barrel proteins could possibly be required for the action of tBid/Bax on mitochondria. To investigate the role of Tom40, the pore-forming subunit of the TOM complex, we used yeast mutants expressing a temperature-sensitive version of Tom40, which is inactivated by incubation at a non-permissive temperature 37 °C (21Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert W. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 289-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 22Kassenbrock C.K. Cao W. Douglas M.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); since Tom40 is essential for cell viability, there is no yeast mutant completely devoid of this protein. Incubation at non-permissive temperature in the absence of tBid/Bax did not lead to cytochrome c release from either mutant or wild type mitochondria (Fig. 2A). Further, when mitochondria from both strains were incubated with tBid and Bax at permissive temperature, the extent of cytochrome c release was similar. However, when the mitochondria were preincubated at non-permissive temperature, which destroys the function of the mutant Tom40 protein, tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release from wild type mitochondria was not affected, whereas mitochondria from the tom40-4 strain, as well as those from the tom40-2 strain (not shown), reproducibly released less cytochrome c when exposed to tBid/Bax (Fig. 2, A and B). Thus, it appears that functional Tom40 is required for the release process in yeast. Bax Insertion Is Affected in tom40-4 Mitochondria-It has previously been shown that Tom40 is involved not only in the translocation of precursor proteins across the mitochondrial outer membrane but also in the insertion of proteins into this membrane (for review, see Ref. 23Rapaport D. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the insertion of outer membrane signal-anchored proteins, such as Tom20 and Tom70, does not require receptors of the TOM complex but is mediated by the Tom40 protein (16Ahting U. Waizenegger T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Bax insertion was defective in the tom40 mutants, we employed fractionation experiments with alkaline treatment. Bax was recovered in similar quantities in the membrane fraction of wild type mitochondria, independently of whether they had been preincubated at 37 °C or not. In contrast, Bax insertion was strongly reduced in the heat-treated tom40-4 mitochondria (Fig. 2C). This finding suggests that a functional Tom40 is required for Bax insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane. To verify the defective protein import in the tom40-4 strain, we investigated the import of [35S]methionine-labeled pSu9-DHFR into these mitochondria. Import of this model precursor protein can be monitored by the formation of the mature polypeptide that is resistant to externally added trypsin. Import proceeded normally in mitochondria from the tom40-4 strain incubated at permissive temperature. However, if the mitochondria were preincubated at non-permissive temperature, the import of this protein was markedly decreased (Fig. 2D). As expected, wild type mitochondria that had been preincubated at 37 °C showed no import defect (not shown). The TOM Complex Is Not Required for Cytochrome c Release Induced by Chemically Oligomerized Bax-To exclude the possibility that heat-treated mitochondria from the tom40-4 strain are unable to release proteins from their intermembrane space, we incubated mitochondria from this strain with chemically oligomerized Bax. This form of Bax is known to have undergone conformational changes that resemble those found under apoptotic conditions (7Yethon J.A. Epand R.F. Leber B. Epand R.M. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48935-48941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). When these mitochondria were incubated with oligomeric Bax, the resulting cytochrome c release was identical, whether or not the mitochondria contained functional Tom40 (Fig. 2E). Thus, it seems that mitochondria from the tom40-4 strain are in fact able to release cytochrome c from their intermembrane space and that permeabilization of the outer membrane by chemically oligomerized Bax and by tBid-activated monomeric Bax occurs by distinct mechanisms. At Harsher Incubation Conditions, the TOM Complex, but not tBid, Is Required for Bax to Release Cytochrome c-It was recently reported that during prolonged (1 h) incubation of yeast mitochondria at 37 °C, tBid was not required for Bax to release cytochrome c and that the release process was unaffected by tom40 mutations (24Sanjuan Szklarz L.K. Kozjak-Pavlovic V. Vogtle F.N. Chacinska A. Milenkovic D. Vogel S. Durr M. Westermann B. Guiard B. Martinou J.C. Borner C. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed a series of experiments under similar conditions. Indeed, when the yeast mitochondria were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, monomeric Bax-induced cytochrome c release was observed and occurred independently of tBid (Fig. 2F). However, in our experiments (Fig. 1B), the addition of tBid still enhanced Bax-induced cytochrome c release, a finding that more accurately reflects the situation prevailing in the mammalian and liposome systems. A possible explanation for this discrepancy between yeast and mammalian mitochondria is that yeast does not contain any anti-apoptotic Bcl-2-like proteins, which might inhibit “accidental” insertion of Bax and/or its assembly into functional oligomeres (24Sanjuan Szklarz L.K. Kozjak-Pavlovic V. Vogtle F.N. Chacinska A. Milenkovic D. Vogel S. Durr M. Westermann B. Guiard B. Martinou J.C. Borner C. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The low effectiveness of this process in the absence of tBid seen under our conditions (Fig. 1B) could increase in a time- and temperature-dependent manner and thus lead to a more efficient Bax-induced cytochrome c release under those harsher conditions. However, in contrast to the findings of Sanjuan Szklarz et al. (24Sanjuan Szklarz L.K. Kozjak-Pavlovic V. Vogtle F.N. Chacinska A. Milenkovic D. Vogel S. Durr M. Westermann B. Guiard B. Martinou J.C. Borner C. Pfanner N. Meisinger C. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 44-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the amount of cytochrome c released from tom40-4 mitochondria (and from tom40-2 mitochondria, not shown) under those harsher conditions was lower as compared with that found with wild type mitochondria, which showed almost complete release (Fig. 2F). From this, we concluded that also during prolonged incubation at higher temperature, the functionality of the TOM complex affects the amount of cytochrome c that can be released by Bax. Bax Interacts Directly with the TOM Complex-To analyze whether Bax can interact directly with the TOM complex in vitro, we incubated isolated TOM core complex (consisting of Tom40, Tom22, Tom5, Tom6, and Tom7 from N. crassa) with tBid and Bax. After incubation for 15 min at 30 °C, the sample was split and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against Tom40, Bax, or a control antibody. Antibodies against Tom40 recovered Tom40 and, to a lesser extent, Bax. Similarly, antibodies against Bax could precipitate Bax together with a lower, but significant, amount of Tom40. The control antibody, however, did not precipitate any detectable Bax or Tom40 (Fig. 3A). From this, we concluded that isolated TOM core complex and Bax can interact with each other in vitro. Next, we asked whether Bax might interact directly with the TOM complex during import into isolated yeast mitochondria. As the interactions of protein insertases with their substrates are normally transient and occur with low affinities, we performed the experiment at low temperature to slow down the speed of the reaction. To do so, mitochondria were incubated at 4 °C with the recombinant proteins and permeabilized after 2 and 30 min. Next, the lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation using antibodies against Tom22 and porin (Fig. 3B). Antibodies against Tom22 allowed isolating Tom22 together with Tom40. Bax was only co-immunoprecipitated with the TOM complex from lysates of mitochondria that were exposed to Bax for 2 min but not from lysates of mitochondria that were incubated with Bax for 30 min. Antibodies against porin did not co-immunoprecipitate Bax or the TOM complex. From this, we concluded that Bax interacts transiently with the TOM complex during its insertion into the outer mitochondrial membrane. Antibodies against the TOM Complex Inhibit Cytochrome c Release from Mammalian Mitochondria-To investigate whether the TOM complex is required for tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release by another, independent approach, we performed antibody competition experiments. Thus, we preincubated isolated yeast mitochondria with antibodies against Tom20 and Tom22 and probed for tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release. Both Tom20 and Tom22 are subunits of the TOM complex that expose a large domain into the cytosol. Preincubation with antibodies against these proteins markedly decreased cytochrome c release (Fig. 4A), suggesting that antibodies against the receptors of the TOM complex can inhibit cytochrome c release from yeast mitochondria. Next, we investigated whether the TOM complex might also be involved in tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release from mammalian mitochondria. For this purpose, we used embryonic fibroblasts from Bax/Bak double knock-out mice (25Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). When the plasma membrane was permeabilized with low concentrations of digitonin, which left the mitochondrial outer membrane intact, there was no cytochrome c released from the mitochondria (Fig. 4B). As expected, cytochrome c release could be induced by the combined addition of tBid and Bax but not with tBid or Bax alone (not shown). When these permeabilized cells were preincubated with antibodies directed against Tom20, cytochrome c release could be blocked efficiently. In contrast, antibodies against mitochondrial porin did not protect from cytochrome c release. Similarly, preincubation with Tom20 antibodies decreased the amount of Bax associated with the mitochondria, whereas incubation with a porin antibody did not show any effect. These findings are similar to those reported for the biogenesis of the single membrane-spanning protein Tom22, whose insertion into the outer membrane of rat liver mitochondria could be blocked by antibodies against Tom20 (26Nakamura Y. Suzuki H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21223-21232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Finally, we investigated the effect of the antibodies on import of pSu9-DHFR. Although antibodies against Tom20 completely inhibited import and maturation of this model protein, antibodies against porin had no effect (Fig. 4C). From this, we can conclude that inhibition of the mammalian TOM complex with antibodies leads to a decreased protein import into mitochondria and also reduces tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release. Concluding Remarks-In this study, we show that a functional TOM complex is required for optimal tBid/Bax-induced cytochrome c release from yeast and mammalian mitochondria and that the combination of tBid and monomeric Bax is sufficient to trigger this release process, as no other Bcl-2 family proteins are present in yeast. Cardiolipin, mitochondrial porins, and cytosolic domains of outer membrane proteins appear not to play an important role in the targeting of Bax to yeast mitochondria. The finding that Bax requires the TOM complex for insertion is reminiscent of a similar requirement for insertion of single membrane-spanning proteins, such as Tom20, Tom22, and Tom70, into the mitochondrial outer membrane (16Ahting U. Waizenegger T. Neupert W. Rapaport D. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 48-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, interaction with the TOM complex could be a crucial step in the targeting of Bax to the mitochondrial outer membrane, which is an important event during apoptosis signaling (Fig. 5). In addition, it appears likely that the interaction of tBid with Bax may facilitate the membrane insertion of Bax via the TOM complex (27Ruffolo S.C. Breckenridge D.G. Nguyen M. Goping I.S. Gross A. Korsmeyer S.J. Li H. Yuan J. Shore G.C. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Such interaction might result in conformational changes, which allow targeting signals in Bax to be exposed and recognized by the TOM complex. The TOM complex might then mediate the insertion of monomeric Bax into the mitochondrial outer membrane, where, possibly with the help of tBid or solely by the close contact with the membrane (7Yethon J.A. Epand R.F. Leber B. Epand R.M. Andrews D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48935-48941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), Bax can oligomerize to form pores. Notably, tBid seems not to mediate, but rather facilitate, the process of Bax insertion and oligomerization in the yeast outer membrane, as monomeric Bax alone can provoke cytochrome c release, although with a lower effectiveness as compared with a combination of monomeric Bax and tBid (Figs. 1B and 3F). The observation that cytochrome c release induced by chemically oligomerized Bax did not display a requirement for the TOM complex suggests that this form of Bax has already undergone the conformational changes needed for membrane integration and assembly. The nature of the targeting signal of Bax is yet unclear. Bax possesses a C-terminal α helix that shares some homology with the signals known to direct tail-anchored proteins to mitochondria. Deletion of this domain abolishes the proapoptotic activity of the molecule (8Nechushtan A. Smith C.L. Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2330-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). However, the N terminus was also suggested to posses targeting information (28Cartron P.F. Priault M. Oliver L. Meflah K. Manon S. Vallette F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11633-11641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), although this domain does not show a signature found in signal-anchored proteins. Further experimental work is also required to characterize the molecular mechanism(s) by which the TOM complex, possibly with the help of tBid and other factors, mediates the insertion of Bax into the mitochondrial outer membrane.

Recent studies have indicated that the accumulation of mutant α1-antitrypsin Z in the ER specifically activates the autophagic response but not the unfolded protein response and that autophagy plays a critical role in disposal of insoluble α1-antitrypsin Z. In this study, we used genomic analysis of the liver in a novel transgenic mouse model with inducible expression to screen for changes in gene expression that would potentially define how the liver responds to accumulation of this mutant protein. There was no unfolded protein response. Of several distinct gene expression profiles, marked up-regulation of regulator of G signaling (RGS16) was particularly notable. RGS16 did not increase when model systems were exposed to classical inducers of ER stress, including tunicamycin and calcium ionophore, or when a nonpolymerogenic α1-antitrypsin mutant accumulated in the ER. RGS16 was up-regulated in livers from patients with α1-antitrypsin deficiency, and the degree of up-regulation correlated with the hepatic levels of insoluble α1-antitrypsin Z protein. Taken together, these results indicate that expression of RGS16 is an excellent marker for the distinct form of “ER stress” that occurs in α1-antitrypsin deficiency, presumably determined by the aggregation-prone properties of the mutant protein that characterizes the deficiency.

From many years of research on the disease, we now know that these globules represent rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) distended by accumulation of the mutant ATZ molecule (where ATZ is the Z variant of α1-antitrypsin). The wild type AT is a classical liver-derived secretory glycoprotein that is delivered by the circulating blood to tissues to subserve its predominant function of inhibiting the neutrophil serine proteases neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3. The point mutation that characterizes the ATZ variant converts glutamate 342 to lysine and is sufficient to result in selective retention of the glycoprotein in the ER (reviewed in Refs. 1Perlmutter D.H. Pediatr. Res. 2006; 60: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 2Perlmutter D.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).

Characterization of the structure of AT and its functional correlates led to the remarkable observation that the substitution of lysine for glutamate 342 conferred on the ATZ molecule a tendency to polymerize and aggregate (3Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar, 4Lomas D.A. Mahadeva R. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although it is still not clear whether the tendency to polymerize is the cause, or an effect, of ER retention, there is clear-cut evidence that polymers and aggregates of this molecule are formed in the ER, and there is growing evidence that these polymers and aggregates play a role in how liver cells respond and whether liver inflammation and carcinogenesis evolve in individuals homozygous for the ATZ allele (2Perlmutter D.H. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 110: 1579-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 5Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). This is a particularly important issue because we know from unique epidemiological studies carried out in Sweden over the last 35 years that there is wide variability in the liver disease phenotype of individuals that are homozygous for the ATZ allele with only a subpopulation developing severe liver inflammation and/or carcinoma (6Sveger T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 294: 1316-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 7Sveger T. Acta Paediatr. Scand. 1998; 77: 847-851Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Thus, the Swedish studies implicate genetic modifiers and/or environmental factors that determine the hepatic phenotype of this disease. Cellular response pathways that are activated by the ER stress state are therefore theoretically candidate genetic modifiers or targets of environmental factors that determine the hepatic phenotype. Furthermore, cellular response pathways are potential targets for preventive or therapeutic interventions. In a recent study we began to characterize the cellular response pathways that are activated by accumulation of ATZ in the ER by using cell line and transgenic mouse models with inducible expression of ATZ (5Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We reasoned that these types of model systems would provide highly controlled information about the earliest activation events and would ultimately permit an elucidation of the effect of ER ATZ retention in terms of duration, concentration, and developmental stage. The initial studies in these novel model systems examined known potential response pathways and showed that accumulation of ATZ in the ER activates the autophagic response, the ER overload pathway characterized by activated NFκB, ER, and mitochondrial caspases and BAP31, an ER protein that is thought to mediate pro-apoptotic signals from the ER to the mitochondria. Accumulation of ATZ in the ER did not activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the model systems or in human liver tissue (5Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We have surmised that this is because of the intrinsic properties of ATZ, perhaps its tendency to polymerize in the ER, because two other naturally occurring nonpolymerogenic AT mutants that accumulate in the ER do activate the UPR. In addition to its importance in understanding the pathogenesis of liver injury in AT deficiency, this last observation provides evidence that ER stress is not synonymous with activation of the UPR, a notion frequently implied in the literature. The autophagic response appears to be a particularly important part of the cellular response to ATZ accumulation. Our recent studies using cell lines genetically deficient in autophagy show that the autophagic response is essential for disposal of ATZ (8Kamimoto T. Shoji S. Hidvegi T. Mizushima N. Umebayashi K. Perlmutter D.H. Yoshimori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4467-4476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the absence of autophagy, inclusions of ATZ were markedly propagated throughout the cytoplasm. Moreover, by using a mouse model with inducible expression of ATZ mated to a mouse model that makes green fluorescent autophagosomes, we found that accumulation of ATZ in the ER is sufficient to activate the autophagic response (8Kamimoto T. Shoji S. Hidvegi T. Mizushima N. Umebayashi K. Perlmutter D.H. Yoshimori T. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4467-4476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the importance of the autophagic response has been provided by Kruse et al. (9Kruse K.B. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) who by screening for yeast mutants that were impaired in degradation of ATZ found that autophagy gene atg6 was essential for disposal of the insoluble forms of ATZ. Atg6 was also found to be essential for disposal of mutant fibrinogen subunits that accumulate in the ER in insoluble fibrils in the liver disease associated with inherited hypofibrinogenemia (10Kruse K.B. Dear A. Kaltenbrun E.R. Crum B.E. George P.M. Brennan S.O. McCracken A.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2006; 168: 1299-1308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Together, these studies have suggested that the autophagic response is specialized for the type of ER stress that is associated with mutant proteins that are aggregationprone (11Perlmutter D.H. Autophagy. 2006; 2: 258-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study, we used genomic analysis of liver from the Z mouse, which has hepatocyte-specific, inducible expression of ATZ, as a method to determine whether there were other cellular response pathways activated by accumulation of ATZ in vivo. Using the inducible system we can titrate the duration, concentration, and developmental stage of the pathologic event, and the results can be interrogated in the context of powerful controls, including Z mice in which the transgene is not induced, M mice with inducible expression of the wild type AT gene in the induced or uninduced condition, and nontransgenic littermates. Because we already know that ER retention of ATZ does not activate the UPR, we hypothesized that the gene expression profiles that were found to characterize ER accumulation of ATZ in this system would identify signaling pathways that have not been previously implicated in ER stress states. Materials-Rabbit anti-human AT antibody was purchased from Dako (Santa Barbara, CA); goat anti-human AT IgG was from Diasorin (Stillwater, MN); antibody to GAPDH was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp.; and antibody to regulator of G protein signaling 16 (RGS16) and GRP78 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Purified human AT was purchased from Athens Research and Technologies (Athens, GA). Tunicamycin and A23187 were from Sigma. Human liver originated from excess liver tissue of normal liver transplant donors and from the native liver of patients with homozygous AT deficiency that underwent liver transplantation as approved by the Human Studies Committee of Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. Transgenic Mice-Mice with hepatocyte-specific inducible expression of wild type AT (M mice), mutant ATZ (Z mice), mutant ATSaar (Saar mice), and mutant ATSaarZ (SaarZ mice) have been described previously (5Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These mice were maintained with doxycycline (dox; 40 μg/ml; changed twice weekly) until expression of AT was induced by withdrawal of dox over specified time intervals. The PiZ mouse model with constitutive, tissue-unspecific expression of mutant ATZ (12Carlson J.A. Rogers B.B. Sifers R.N. Finegold M.J. Clift S.M. DeMayo F.J. Bullock D.W. Woo S.L.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1989; 83: 1183-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) bred into the C57/BL6 background has also been described previously (5Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For specific experiments tunicamycin was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 1 μg/g body weight in 150 mm dextrose, and mice were then sacrificed 18 h later for harvesting of the liver, a protocol that has been shown to alter the processing of XBP1 mRNA in a manner consistent with activation of the UPR (5Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Serum samples were obtained by retro-orbital puncture and stored at –20 °C until use. Mice were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. Liver and other tissue were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen before storage at –70 °C. All mice were sacrificed in the morning hours unless specified otherwise. Maintenance and all experimental manipulations of the mice were approved by the Animal Research and Care Committee of Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, Rangos Research Center. Cell Lines-Human epidermal HeLa cell lines and murine hepatoma Hepa1–6 cell lines with inducible expression of wild type AT, mutants ATZ, ATSaar, and ATSaarZ have been described previously (5Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The HeLa cell lines are named HTO/M, HTO/Z, HTO/Saar, and HTO/SaarZ, and the Hepa cell lines are named HepaTO/M, HepaTO/Z, HepaTO/Saar, and HepaTO/SaarZ. The cell lines were maintained in 40 ng/ml dox until expression of AT was induced by withdrawal of the dox for predetermined time intervals. For experiments with tunicamycin and A23187 HepaTO cell lines were treated for 3 h with tunicamycin (2.5 mg/ml), A23187 (0.25 mm), or solvent control (Me2SO) in an equivalent volume. Western Blot Analysis and ELISA-For Western blots, serum samples were diluted 1:200 in PBS/Tween 20/Laemmli loading buffer and 10-μl samples loaded on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Liver samples were homogenized by Dounce homogenizer using 3 ml of Argon buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% NaDOC, 0.5% Triton X-100). Samples were loaded with 20 μg of total protein for detection of AT and 100 μg for detection of RGS16. Purified human AT (5 ng) was used as a positive control. Blots were blocked in PBS, Tween 20, 5% milk and then incubated with goat anti-human AT or goat antimouse RGS16 in blocking buffer as first antibody. Horseradish peroxidase anti-goat IgG from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) was used as secondary antibody. Blots were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura from Pierce. For ELISA, mouse serum was diluted 1:10,000 in PBS/Tween 20, 2% bovine serum albumin, 1% milk. Liver homogenates were diluted 1:20 in PBS/Tween 20 (100 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, 0.05% Tween 20). Total protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay kit from Pierce. Purified human AT at dilutions of 1–100 ng/ml was used as standard. 96-Well plates were coated with rabbit antihuman AT, blocked with PBS/Tween 20, and the samples applied. The secondary antibody was goat anti-human AT and then anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate and OPD substrate were used for detection. High Density Oligonucleotide Array Analysis-Z mice and M mice were studied at ages 6 weeks and 3 months. For each, groups of three mice that had been on or off dox from birth were included. One group of FVB/N mice at the same age was also included as a nontransgenic control. Total RNA was extracted from the liver using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and the RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). RNA quality control was carried out with the 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 NanoLab-Chip kit (Agilent Technologies). The validity of the experimental paradigm was verified by Western blot analysis from the same livers and Q-PCR from the RNA samples. In each case the levels of AT corresponded to the presence or absence of dox (see below). cDNA and cRNA synthesis using the liver RNA samples was carried out according to the instructions from Affymetrix. Hybridization to the mouse MOE430A chip set was carried out by the University of Pittsburgh PittArray core facility. Microarray images were analyzed using Affymetrix GCOS 1.2 software. Signal intensity was scaled to 150 for each microarray. Probe level data (CEL files) were processed by S-PLUS 6.2 array analyzer module (Insightful). Normalization to adjust for back-ground noise, to correct for random and nonspecific binding was done as follows: background control = robust multichip analysis and normalization = quantiles. The differential expression analysis was performed applying local pooled error (LPE) test with Bonferroni adjustment (family-wise error rate/family detection rate control = 0.05). Expression data of M mice off dox (M4) and M mice on dox (M1) at each age were compared with each other (M4vs1), followed by the same procedure using Z mice off dox (Z4) compared with Z mice on dox (Z1). Intensity ratios were then expressed. Significantly increased and decreased genes (p < 0.05) in the wild type (M) group were subtracted from the pool of significantly increased and decreased genes (p < 0.05) in the mutant (Z) group, and the fold change threshold was set to 1.8 in juvenile (6-week-old) and 2.0 in adult (3-month-old) comparisons (Fig. 2, analysis strategy). Hierarchical clustering was carried out with the Genes at Work software (13Lepre J. Rice J.J. Tu Y. Stolovitzky G. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2004; 20: 1033-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Pathway analysis was carried out by subjecting the data set containing differentially expressed genes to analysis for relevant molecular interactions, biological functions, and pathways using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool. Comparison between the two groups was carried out with unpaired t test and/or Mann-Whitney Rank sum test (SigmaStat 2.03). Real Time Quantitative PCR-Total RNA was purified from mouse liver using RNeasy columns (Qiagen); three livers per condition were harvested. First strand cDNA (RT reaction) was synthesized from 500 ng of RNA using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's directions. A negative control was also performed without enzyme (NRT reaction). RT and NRT reactions were also performed on 500 ng of commercially prepared liver RNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) to serve as the calibrator for the real time QPCRs. Each experimental sample was normalized to a nontransgenic control (fold change). For PCR, duplicate aliquots of the RT reaction and 1 aliquot of the NRT reaction served as templates for the target genes and the control gene β-glucuronidase. Reaction components, including the ROC internal control, were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The probes and primers were obtained from Applied Biosystems (FAM™ dye labeled TaqMan® minor groove binder probes, inventoried assays). Real time reactions were run on an ABI7000 and ABI7300 with the following cycle conditions: 95 °C for 12 min (95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min) for 40 cycles. Differential gene expression was calculated by the ΔΔCT calculation (14Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods (San Diego). 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). The ΔΔCT method controls for potential differences in efficiency of the RT, as well as the PCR, whereas calculations based on standard curves do not (ΔΔCT =ΔCT(exp) –ΔCT(ctr) when ΔCT = CT(gene)–CT(norm)). Gene Expression Profile in the Liver in Response to Accumulation of ATZ in Hepatocytes-To ensure that the model system was appropriate, liver was harvested from 3-month-old Z and mice that had been on or off dox since birth, and then subjected to Western blot analysis for AT (Fig. 1). The results show that the AT polypeptide is detected in equivalent amounts in the Z and M mice but only when off dox. There was no detectable AT when either mouse had been on dox. Control included equivalent amounts of liver from a normal human specimen, a specimen from a patient homozygous for AT deficiency, and the PiZ mouse that has ubiquitous constitutive expression of human ATZ (5Hidvegi T. Schmidt B.Z. Hale P. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39002-39015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These controls show that the AT expressed in the Z and M mice migrates to the same electrophoretic mobility and is present at the same or lower steady state levels indicating that it is not expressed at supra-physiologic levels in these models. Absence of a signal in liver from the FVB/N mouse, the back-ground strain for the Z and M mice, provides reassurance that the Western blot analysis is done under conditions that do not detect the endogenous murine AT ortholog. Next, high density oligonucleotide array analysis of hepatic genes was carried out in Z mice at 6 weeks of age (“juvenile”) and 3 months of age (“adult”). Groups of three mice each had (Z1) or did not have dox (Z4) in the drinking water. Controls included M mice on (M1) or off (M4) dox and nontransgenic mice from the background strain FVB/N. RNA and protein were extracted from the liver. Changes in AT expression were first validated by Western blot analysis, ELISA, and real time QPCR. RNA was then hybridized to the mouse Affymetrix MOE430A chip set, and the resulting data were subjected to differential expression analysis with the LPE test (S-Plus). Changes in gene expression in the Z4 group versus the Z1 group were compiled. Several criteria were used to conclude that these changes were significant. First, they needed to be greater than 1.8-fold in magnitude. Second, the change needed to be statistically significant. Third, there could not be a similar change in gene expression in the M4 versus the M1 group. Fourth, any significant change in gene expression in the Z4 group compared with the Z1 group needed to be significantly changed in the same way (up-regulated or down-regulated) in the Z4 compared with the M4 and the Z4 compared with the nontransgenic FVB/N group (Fig. 2). Using these criteria, 25 up-regulated transcripts and 24 down-regulated transcripts were identified in the juvenile series and 75 up-regulated transcripts and 131 down-regulated transcripts were identified in the adult series (supplemental Table 1). Six transcripts were up-regulated, and seven transcripts were down-regulated in both juvenile and adult series. There was marked up-regulation of human AT gene expression in Z4 versus Z1 and in M4 versus M1 reaching between 3040- to 8855-fold, providing validation of the induction of AT gene expression. Several patterns of global gene expression changes were notable. The gene expression profile did not reflect an unfolded protein response in any substantive way. The only change in gene expression that was similar to what is seen in the UPR was a 2.4-fold increase in HERPUD1 in the adult series. No other changes in expression of genes known to be altered during the UPR or that appear in previous high density oligonucleotide array analyses of the UPR (15Nair S. Xu C. Shen G. Hebbar V.

The profile of changes in gene expression was analyzed in three ways. First, using the Affymetrix GO Browser software, there were significant changes in 19 categories, the most significant of which were regulation of transcription, lipid/steroid/sterol biosynthesis and metabolism, other biosynthesis/metabolism, cell cycle/proliferation and differentiation/cell fate, signal transduction/signaling, and immune response (supplemental Table 2). Other categories that had significant changes were regulation of protein synthesis, protein and amino acid phosphorylation events, proteolysis, ubiquitin-dependent processes, protein folding, carbohydrate metabolism, electron transport, other transport, circadian rhythm, regulation of apoptosis, cell adhesion, and cytoskeleton. Second, using the statistical analysis program EASE, a large number of biological themes reached significance, most of which overlapped with the GO analysis. Using clustering analysis, the EASE program identified three major clusters in the up-regulated genes and five major clusters in the down-regulated genes. The clusters of up-regulated genes were in categories of regulation of transcription/cellular metabolism/biological rhythm/ubiquitin conjugation (enrichment = 2.18); heme-binding/iron-binding/oxidoreductase/linoleic acid metabolism (enrichment = 1.56); protein-tyrosine kinase/phosphotransferase/ATP-binding/protein serine-threonine kinase (enrichment = 0.66). The clusters of down-regulated genes were in categories of sterol biosynthesis/cholesterol and lipid metabolism (enrichment = 7.44); protein metabolism/ubiquitin conjugation/lipoprotein metabolism (enrichment = 3.22); lysosomal hydrolase/endopeptidase (enrichment = 2.82); chromosomal assembly DNA packaging/chromosomal biogenesis (enrichment = 1.97); regulation of transcription/cell metabolism/zinc-binding/TGFβ signaling (enrichment = 1.65). Third, we used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Significant changes in gene expression were found in a number of categories of molecular and cellular function (Fig. 3A) that were also identified by the GO and EASE programs. Four metabolic and signaling pathway categories were identified, including sterol biosynthesis, glycine/serine/threonine synthesis, antigen presentation, and cytochrome P450 pathways (Fig. 3B). We also used Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to predict networks that are affected by the gene expression profile. This analysis identified 11 networks. The two most powerful of these suggest a marked effect on cellular growth and proliferation/carcinogenesis converging on the SP1, hepatic nuclear factor 4α, Kruppel-like factor 10 transcription factors, bone morphogenic factor 2 (Fig. 4A), and a network showing a marked effect on cellular morphology and cellular compromise converging on tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 2 and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, the effects on tumor necrosis factor superfamily member 2 and FGF19 were not apparent in the gene expression profile and therefore predict post-transcriptional changes in activity of these proteins. The other networks predicted by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis include the following (supplemental Fig. 1): changes in lipid metabolism that would be explained by a decrease in sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factors 1 and 2 (SREBP1 and SREBP2) activity (supplemental Fig. 1a); changes in cellular movement/morphology/assembly that predict an increase in mitogen-activated kinase (ERK2) and ERBB2 (v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2) activity (supplemental Fig. 1b); changes in cell death/carcinogenesis that predict increases in caspase 3 and apoptotic peptidase activating factor 1 activity together with increased transcription factor CEBPβ and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2a activity (supplemental Fig. 1c); a network that converges on increased p53, TNFα-induced protein 2 and TGFβ (transforming growth"
https://openalex.org/W2067102852,"The sphingoid long chain bases (LCBs) and their phosphorylated derivatives (LCB-Ps) are important signaling molecules in eukaryotic organisms. The cellular levels of LCB-Ps are tightly controlled by the coordinated action of the LCB kinase activity responsible for their synthesis and the LCB-P phosphatase and lyase activities responsible for their catabolism. Although recent studies have implicated LCB-Ps as regulatory molecules in plants, in comparison with yeast and mammals, much less is known about their metabolism and function in plants. To investigate the functions of LCB-Ps in plants, we have undertaken the identification and characterization of Arabidopsis genes that encode the enzymes of LCB-P metabolism. In this study the Arabidopsis At1g27980 gene was shown to encode the only detectable LCB-P lyase activity in Arabidopsis. The LCB-P lyase activity was characterized, and mutant plant lines lacking the lyase were generated and analyzed. Whereas in other organisms loss of LCB-P lyase activity is associated with accumulation of high levels of LCB/LCB-Ps and developmental abnormalities, the sphingolipid profiles of the mutant plants were remarkably similar to those of wild-type plants, and no developmental abnormalities were observed. Thus, these studies indicate that the lyase plays a minor role in maintenance of sphingolipid metabolism during normal plant development and growth. However, a clear role for the lyase was revealed upon perturbation of sphingolipid synthesis by treatment with the inhibitor of ceramide synthase, fumonisin B(1)."
https://openalex.org/W2051311695,"Abstract NhaA, the Na+/H+ antiporter of Escherichia coli, exists in the native membrane as a homodimer of which two monomers have been suggested to be attached by a β-hairpin at the periplasmic side of the membrane. Constructing a mutant deleted of the β-hairpin, NhaA/Δ(Pro45-Asn58), revealed that in contrast to the dimeric mobility of native NhaA, the mutant has the mobility of a monomer in a blue native gel. Intermolecular cross-linking that monitors dimers showed that the mutant exists only as monomers in the native membrane, proteoliposomes, and when purified in β-dodecyl maltoside micelles. Furthermore, pull-down experiments revealed that, whereas as expected for a dimer, hemagglutinin-tagged wild-type NhaA co-purified with His-tagged NhaA on a Ni2+-NTA affinity column, a similar version of the mutant did not. Remarkably, under routine stress conditions (0.1 m LiCl, pH 7 or 0.6 m NaCl, pH 8.3), the monomeric form of NhaA is fully functional. It conferred salt resistance to NhaA- and NhaB-deleted cells, and whether in isolated membrane vesicles or reconstituted into proteoliposomes exhibited Na+/H+ antiporter activity and pH regulation very similar to wild-type dimers. Remarkably, under extreme stress conditions (0.1 m LiCl or 0.7 m NaCl at pH 8.5), the dimeric native NhaA was much more efficient than the monomeric mutant in conferring extreme stress resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2133170382,"Three-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, known as statins, induce skeletal muscle injury including myalgia, myositis, and rhabdomyolysis. The mechanism of this myotoxicity remains unknown. This study examined the effect of statins on single skeletal myofibers enzymatically isolated from the rat flexor digitorum brevis muscles. Fluvastatin and pravastatin induced the formation of numerous vacuoles in the myofibers after 72 h of treatment. This effect progressed in a time- and concentration-dependent manner and, consequently, cell death occurred after 120 h. Electron micrographs revealed craters along the sarcolemma and swelling of the sarcoplasmic reticula and mitochondria, in addition to intracellular vacuoles. When caffeine was added after 72 h of fluvastatin treatment, contractile shortening of statin-treated myofibers was significantly attenuated and blebs formed on the surface of the myofibers. The coapplication of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) with fluvastatin prevented the morphological changes, while that of farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) was ineffective. Furthermore, perillyl alcohol, an inhibitor of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase-I (GGTase-I), mimicked the effect of statins, while a specific GGTase-I inhibitor (GGTI-298) or a farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI-277) failed to do so. These results suggest that the inactivation of Rab GTPase, which involved in intracellular membrane transport, is a crucial factor in statin-induced-morphological abnormality in skeletal muscle fibers."
https://openalex.org/W1995076371,"Chemokine receptor CCR3 is highly expressed by eosinophils and signals in response to binding of the eotaxin family of chemokines, which are up-regulated in allergic disorders. Consequently, CCR3 blockade is of interest as a possible therapeutic approach for the treatment of allergic disease. We have described previously a bispecific antagonist of CCR1 and CCR3 named UCB35625 that was proposed to interact with the transmembrane residues Tyr-41, Tyr-113, and Glu-287 of CCR1, all of which are conserved in CCR3. Here, we show that cells expressing the CCR3 constructs Y113A and E287Q are insensitive to antagonism by UCB35625 and also exhibit impaired chemotaxis in response to CCL11/eotaxin, suggesting that these residues are important for antagonist binding and also receptor activation. Furthermore, mutation of the residue Tyr-113 to alanine was found to turn the antagonist UCB35625 into a CCR3 agonist. Screens of small molecule libraries identified a novel specific agonist of CCR3 named CH0076989. This was able to activate eosinophils and transfectants expressing both wild-type CCR3 and a CCR1–CCR3 chimeric receptor lacking the CCR3 amino terminus, indicating that this region of CCR3 is not required for CH0076989 binding. A direct interaction with the transmembrane helices of CCR3 was supported by mutation of the residues Tyr-41, Tyr-113, and Glu-287 that resulted in complete loss of CH0076989 activity, suggesting that the compound mimics activation by CCL11. We conclude that both agonists and antagonists of CCR3 appear to occupy overlapping sites within the transmembrane helical bundle, suggesting a fine line between agonism and antagonism of chemokine receptors.

Asthma is characterized by the accumulation within the bronchial wall of leukocytes, of which the eosinophil predominates (1Gleich G.J. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2000; 105: 651-663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). Once recruited, eosinophils release a variety of mediators implicated in asthma pathology. Some of these, such as major basic protein, eosinophil cationic protein, and eosinophil peroxidase, can directly induce tissue damage (2Venge P. Dahl R. Fredens K. Peterson C.G. Am. Rev. Respir.

This is postulated to lead to conformational changes in the receptor, resulting in G protein recruitment and activation of intracellular signaling. Data from studies of activation of the related receptor CCR5 suggest that the amino terminus of the chemokine disrupts interactions between the side chains of neighboring transmembrane helices, leading to the induction of the active receptor conformation (17Blanpain C.

A homology model of the structure of the CCR1 transmembrane region, calculated using the structure of the related receptor rhodopsin as a template (27Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A.

Here we show that within CCR3 the conserved residues Tyr-113 and Glu-287 are important for the antagonist activity of UCB35625 and also for the agonist activity of CCL11. We also describe a novel small molecule agonist of CCR3, CH0076989, which binds to a site within the receptor overlapping that of the antagonist.

Generation of HA-CCR3 Point Mutants-A CCR3 construct tagged at the amino terminus with the HA epitope was used as a template for mutagenesis. Point mutants of human HA-CCR3 were generated by PCR according to the manufacturer's instructions, using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Verification of mutation was performed by DNA sequencing on both strands (MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Cell Culture and Transfection-The murine pre-B lymphoma cell line L1.2 was maintained in suspension in HEPES-modified RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1× minimal essential medium non-essential amino acids at 37 °C with 5% CO2 at a density of no more than 1 × 106 cells/ml. The previously described 4DE4 cell line stably transfected with CCR3 (15Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19972-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was cultured in the aforementioned medium supplemented with 1 mg/ml G-418. L1.2 cells were transiently transfected by electroporation with 1 μg of DNA/1 × 106 cells as described previously (23Auger G.A. Pease J.E. Shen X. Xanthou G. Barker M.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1052-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and were incubated overnight in the presence of 10 mm sodium butyrate to increase responsiveness. Flow Cytometry-Approximately 5 × 105 cells were harvested, washed once with fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (0.25% bovine serum albumin and 0.01% NaN3 in HEPES-modified phosphate-buffered saline), and incubated with 50 μg/ml anti-HA/anti-CCR3 antibody or the appropriate isotype control in 100 μl of ice-cold FACS buffer for 20 min. Cells were then washed with FACS buffer and incubated with 50 μg/ml of the corresponding secondary antibody for 20 min in 50 μl of ice-cold FACS buffer. After this, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 400 μl of FACS buffer before being analyzed by flow cytometry as described previously (26de Mendonca F.L. da Fonseca P.C. Phillips R.M.

Chemotaxis Assay-The chemotactic responsiveness of cells was ascertained using ChemoTx™ plates (NeuroProbe, Gaithersburg, MD) as described previously (26de Mendonca F.L. da Fonseca P.C. Phillips R.M.

Using an assay buffer of RPMI supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, duplicate concentrations of agonist in the presence or absence of UCB35625 were applied in a final volume of 31 μl to the lower wells of the chemotaxis chamber. The filter was put in place and 2 × 105 cells in the same assay buffer were applied to the upper surface. Following a 5-h incubation in a humidified chamber at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2, the number of migrating cells traversing a 5-μm pore filter were counted using a hemocytometer. Data are shown as the percentage of migrating cells. Internalization Assay-Chemokine receptor internalization was assessed by the loss of cell surface receptor expression as determined by flow cytometry using an antibody directed against CCR3 (28Sabroe I. Jorritsma A. Stubbs V.E. Xanthou G. Jopling L.A. Ponath P.D. Williams T.J. Murphy P.M. Pease J.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). 1 × 106 cells were resuspended in duplicate in 100 μl of ice-cold culture medium with an additional tube serving as a buffer control. One set of cells was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min prior to the addition of appropriate stimuli while the duplicates remained on ice. Either 100 nm CCL11, 10 μm CH0076989, or 10 μm UCB35625 were added to tubes incubating at 37 °C or their controls on ice. All samples were then incubated for 20 min at either 37 °C or on ice before washing, staining, and receptor expression analysis by flow cytometry. The remaining receptor expression was calculated as the mean fluorescence of antibody-stained chemokine cells - mean fluorescence of isotype-stained chemokine-treated cells. This was expressed as a percentage of mean fluorescence of buffer-treated cells. Gated Autofluorescence Forward Scatter (GAFS) Assay-GAFS assays were performed as described previously (29Sabroe I.

Blood was taken from healthy donors according to a protocol approved by the St. Mary's Hospital Ethics Committee, and granulocytes (comprising neutrophils and eosinophils) were isolated over discontinuous platelet-depleted plasma/Percoll gradients (30Haslett C. Guthrie L.A. Kopaniak M.M. Johnston R.B. Henson P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1985; 119: 101-110PubMed Google Scholar). Granulocytes were preincubated at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml for 30 min at room temperature in filtered GAFS buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.9 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin). The cells were washed and then incubated in GAFS buffer with varying concentrations of CH0076989 for 4 min at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. Cells were then placed on ice and 250 μl of ice-cold fixative added. Finally the cells were analyzed on a FACScaliber (BD Biosciences) as described previously (29Sabroe I. Hartnell A. Jopling L.A. Bel S. Ponath P.D. Pease J.E. Collins P.D. Williams T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2946-2955PubMed Google Scholar). Homology Modeling-Generation of a CCR3 model structure and docking of antagonists and agonists were carried out as previously described (26de Mendonca F.L. da Fonseca P.C. Phillips R.M. Saldanha J.W. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4808-4816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), using our earlier model of CCR1 as a template. Data and Statistical Analysis-Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments and were analyzed with a relevant statistical test, where stated, using PRISM v4.03 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Identification of the Binding Pocket within CCR3 for UCB35625-We have previously described the bispecific CCR1–CCR3 antagonist UCB35625 (Fig. 1A), which antagonizes responses mediated by either CCR1 and CCR3, with the compound an order of magnitude more potent at CCR1 (25Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The mode of action of this compound at either receptor is intriguing. While the compound is unable to effectively displace chemokines from either receptor (as deduced by radiolabeled binding studies), in assays of eosinophil shape change the compound induces profiles of insurmountable antagonism (reduced maximal response) from CCR1-expressing cells and profiles of surmountable antagonism (right-shifted response) from CCR3-expressing cells (25Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Using L1.2 CCR3 transfectants, chemotactic responses to increasing concentrations of CCL11 were assessed in the presence or absence of 500 nm UCB35625 (Fig. 1B). In keeping with earlier reported GAFS data (25Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B. Jorritsma A. Simmons G. Clapham P.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) antagonism was surmountable, with high concentrations of CCL11 able to induce migration albeit with reduced efficacy. This is indicative of a competitive element to the antagonist activity of UCB35625 at CCR3. A previous study from our group determined the binding site of UCB35625 within CCR1, with mutation of the transmembrane (TM) amino acids Tyr-41 (TM1), Tyr-113 (TM3), and Glu-287 (TM7) leading to resistance to UCB35625 (26de Mendonca F.L. da Fonseca P.C. Phillips R.M. Saldanha J.W. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 4808-4816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Because CCR3 and CCR1 exhibit a high level of homology at the amino acid level and all three residues are conserved between both receptors, we postulated that the compound might interact with the same residues within CCR3. HA-tagged Y41A, Y113A, and E287Q mutant CCR3 constructs were generated via site-directed mutagenesis. These were transiently transfected into L1.2 cells along with wild-type (WT) HA-CCR3 and surface receptor expression measured by flow cytometry using an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2A). All three mutants were expressed at the cell surface, although the Y41A mutant appeared to be expressed at slightly reduced levels compared with WT CCR3. The same transfectants were subsequently examined in a chemotaxis assay in response to increasing concentrations of CCL11 in the presence or absence of 500 nm UCB35625 (Fig. 2, B–E). In contrast to our previous findings with CCR1, mutation of Tyr-41 to alanine in CCR3 did not lead to resistance to blockade by UCB35625, with cells expressing this construct responding to CCL11 with an identical profile to cells expressing the WT receptor (Fig. 2, C and B, respectively), albeit with a reduced maximum. This correlates with the apparent reduced expression of the Y41A construct. However, mutagenesis of both Tyr-113 and Glu-287 yielded CCR3 constructs resistant to antagonism of the CCL11 response by UCB35625 (Fig. 2, D and E). Also of interest was the reduced potency of CCL11 for cells expressing the Y113A and E287Q constructs, with little activity observed at the 1 nm concentration of CCL11 compared with cells expressing WT CCR3. This suggests that Tyr-113 and Glu-287 are involved in both antagonist binding and receptor activation by the agonist CCL11. On closer inspection of the response of Y113A transfectants (Fig. 2D), we identified an apparent increase in basal chemotaxis in the absence of CCL11 but in the presence of 500 nm UCB35625, suggesting that the compound might possess agonist activity at this mutated receptor. This was subsequently verified by assessment of the chemotaxis of Y113A and WT CCR3 transfectants to increasing concentrations of the antagonist (Fig. 2F). While UCB35625 was not chemotactic for the WT CCR3 transfectants, Y113A transfectants responded with a typical bell-shaped profile, although with significantly lower efficacy compared with the natural ligand CCL11. Collectively, these data suggest that Tyr-113 and Glu-287 are involved in both antagonist binding and receptor activation by agonist and that mutation of Tyr-113 to alanine converts UCB35625 from an antagonist of CCR3 to a partial agonist of the receptor. The Small Molecule CH0076989 Is an Agonist of CCR3-A subsequent screen of a small molecule library identified a compound, CH0076989 (Fig. 3A), that to our surprise raised the base line of CCL11 responses in the GAFS assay (data not shown). We subsequently investigated whether CH0076989 had agonist activity independent of CCL11. Eosinophils isolated from four different donors were found to respond in a dose-dependent manner to the compound (Fig. 3B), with optimal activity at 1 μm CH0076989, suggesting that the compound was indeed an agonist at an unidentified receptor. Because eosinophils express CCR3 but can also express CCR1 (29Sabroe I. Hartnell A. Jopling L.A. Bel S. Ponath P.D. Pease J.E. Collins P.D. Williams T.J. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2946-2955PubMed Google Scholar, 31Phillips R. Stubbs V.E.L.S. Henson M.R. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. Sabroe I. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 6190-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that one of these receptors might be mediating the response to CH0076989. Stable transfectants expressing CCR3 or CCR1 were used in chemotaxis assays and the responses to increasing amounts of CH0076989 determined (Fig. 4A). Although CCR1 transfectants were unresponsive to the compound, CCR3 transfectants migrated in a concentration-dependent fashion to CH0076989 with optimal chemotaxis observed at 1 μm, identical to the concentration required for optimal activity in the GAFS assay. Preincubation of CCR3 transfectants with anti-CCR3 antibodies reduced chemotactic responses to both 1 μm CH0076989 and 10 nm CCL11 (Fig. 4B), thus confirming that CH0076989 is a specific agonist of CCR3.FIGURE 4The small molecule agonist CH0076789 induces chemotaxis via CCR3 but not CCR1. Panel A shows the chemotactic responses of L1.2 cells stably expressing either CCR1 or CCR3 to increasing concentrations of CH0076789. Panel B shows the response of L1.2 cells stably expressing CCR3 to either 1 μm CH0076789 or 10 nm CCL11 in the presence of a CCR3-specific blocking antibody or an isotype control.

CH0076989 was notably less potent and efficacious than CCL11, with maximal chemotactic responses to CCL11 observed at 3 nm compared with an optimal concentration of 1 μm CH0076989 (Fig. 5A). Upon incubation with a concentration of ligand in excess of that required for optimal chemotaxis, chemokine receptors typically undergo endocytosis or internalization. Because the small molecule showed activity at CCR3 in GAFS and chemotaxis assays, we assessed whether or not the compound could modulate receptor internalization as assayed by flow cytometry using CCR3-specific antibodies. Cell surface expression of CCR3 was seen to be reduced following treatment of L1.2 CCR3 transfectant cells with 100 nm CCL11 for 20 min at 37 °C (Fig. 5B) in agreement with previous findings (28Sabroe I. Jorritsma A. Stubbs V.E. Xanthou G. Jopling L.A. Ponath P.D. Williams T.J. Murphy P.M. Pease J.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 2005; 35: 1301-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A 10-μm concentration of CH0076989 was also seen to induce a loss of CCR3 at the cell surface. In contrast to the reduced efficacy of the compound in chemotaxis assays, CH0076989 reduced surface receptor expression levels to those observed with CCL11 (59.4 and 59.6% of original expression, respectively). Surface expression was not significantly reduced following incubation with 10 μm of the previously characterized CCR1–CCR3 bispecific antagonist UCB35625 (25Sabroe I. Peck M.J. Jan Van Keulen B.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25985-25992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) suggesting that agonist activity at the receptor, and not simply the ability to bind to CCR3, is needed to induce receptor endocytosis. We have previously shown that in order to activate CCR3 CCL11 has to bind to the amino terminus and extracellular regions of the receptor (15Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19972-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Duchesnes C.E. Murphy P.M. Williams T.J. Pease J.E. Mol. Immunol. 2006; 43: 1221-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Indeed, CCR1–CCR3 chimeric constructs in which the amino termini of both receptors are exchanged are unable to efficiently activate G proteins, despite being able to bind ligand (15Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19972-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Because CH0076989 is several orders of magnitude smaller than CCL11, we hypothesized that it may activate CCR3 by binding to different receptor determinants than the natural ligand CCL11. To test this hypothesis, a chimeric receptor (Chi-1) containing amino acids 1–32 from CCR1 fused to amino acids 33–355 of CCR3 (15Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19972-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) was employed in chemotaxis assays (Fig. 6A). Cells transiently expressing either the chimeric construct Chi-1 or wild-type CCR3 were assessed for their chemotactic responses to increasing concentrations of CH0076989 or a fixed concentration of 10 nm CCL11 (Fig. 6, B and C). CCR3 transfectants responded robustly to CCL11 and CH0076989 as seen before (Fig. 5B). Cells expressing Chi-1 transfectants were able to respond to CH0076989 in a manner identical to CCR3 transfectants but showed markedly reduced responsiveness to CCL11 as previously described (15Pease J.E. Wang J. Ponath P.D. Murphy P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19972-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that although the amino terminus of CCR3 is required for effective CCL11 activity, it is dispensable for functional responses to CH0076989. CH0076989 Interacts with a Binding Pocket within CCR3 That Overlaps with That of UCB35625-Because CH0076989 is predominantly hydrophobic and does not appear to interact with the amino terminus of CCR3, we hypothesized that, like UCB35625, CH0076989 might bind to CCR3 within a pocket located between the TM helices. We therefore examined the three mutants of CCR3 that we had generated in our analysis of UCB35625 function, namely Y41A, Y113A, and E287Q. Whereas transfectants expressing WT CCR3 were able to migrate in response to CH0076989,"

Filamentous fungi secrete small proteins, hydrophobins, that have a unique ability to spontaneously form amphiphilic layers on hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces (1Wessels J. Ásgeirsdóttir O., de Vries S. Schuren F. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 793-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophobins are distributed in two classes according to the pattern of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acid residues in the protein sequence and the dissociation resistance of the assembled amphiphilic layers (2Wessels J. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1994; 32: 413-437Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). The pioneering work (3Wösten H. van Wetter M. Lugones L. van der Mei H. Busscher H. Wessels J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 85-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) with the class I hydrophobin SC3 from Schizophyllum commune revealed the dual role served by this protein in the growth of the fungal hypha: hydrophobins reduce the surface tension of water and provide a protective coating on the hyphal surface, once exposed to air. Hydrophobins are an attractive target of study due to their vast application potential provided by their unique characteristics (4Scholtmeijer K. Wessels J. Wösten H. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 56: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Examples include anti-fouling applications, coatings that increase biocompatibility in medical instruments, coatings in drug delivery, surface patterning, use in products of personal care as emulsifiers, use in immobilization techniques, and as very potent foam-forming agents (5Hektor H. Scholtmeijer K. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2005; 16: 1-6Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 6Linder M. Szilvay G. Nakari-Setälä T. Penttilä M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 29: 877-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). In addition, protein purification of hydrophobin fusion proteins in aqueous two-phase systems has been demonstrated (7Linder M. Qiao M. Laumen F. Selber K. Hyytiä T. Nakari-Setälä T. Penttilä M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 11873-11882Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). So that we understand the mechanism of the function of hydrophobins, the structural information of these proteins is crucial. The first hydrophobin structure was determined by x-ray diffraction in 2004 (PDB codes 1R2M, 2B97) (8Hakanpää J. Paananen A. Askolin S. Nakari-Setälä T. Parkkinen T. Penttilä M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 9Hakanpää J. Linder M. Popov A. Schmidt A. Rouvinen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 356-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), describing a class II hydrophobin HFBII from Trichoderma reesei. Now, the structure of a class I hydrophobin EAS from Neurospora crassa has been determined by the NMR method (PDB code 2FMC) (10Kwan A. Winefield R. Sunde M. Matthews J. Haverkamp R. Templeton M. Mackay J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Class I and II hydrophobins, on the basis of determined structures, seem to share a common fold with a small β-barrel forming the core structure and being reinforced by four disulfide bridges formed by the eight conserved cysteine residues that are characteristic of all hydrophobin sequences. The disulfide bridges form in the same, non-consecutive order (Cys-1-Cys-6, Cys-2-Cys-5, Cys-3-Cys-4, Cys-7-Cys-8) in both class I and II structures and align perfectly when the structures are superimposed. The main differences between class I and II hydrophobins are that the class I structure does not contain an α-helix and does contain two large disordered regions. The functional site of class II hydrophobins has been assigned to the hydrophobic area in the molecular surface, composed of hydrophobic side chains of 13 amino acid residues (8Hakanpää J. Paananen A. Askolin S. Nakari-Setälä T. Parkkinen T. Penttilä M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic patch covers ∼18% of the total surface area, and contributing residues are mainly located between the third and the fourth and the seventh and the eighth cysteines in the protein sequence (supplemental data). Unfortunately, this is also the area in which the disordered loops occur in the class I EAS structure (Met-22-Ser-42 and Val-65-Phe-72), and therefore it is difficult to interpret whether the functional site is the same in both classes. However, the disordered regions include many hydrophobic residues, indicating a similar function. In addition, the sequences of class I hydrophobins contain more residues in these areas in comparison to class II hydrophobins. The sequence comparison also reveals that the segment between the fourth and the fifth cysteines in class I hydrophobins is shorter than in class II. This is the location of the α-helix in class II structures and indicates that the lack of the α-helix is a common feature for class I hydrophobins. The place occupied by the α-helix in the class II structure is taken up by two short pieces of β-strands, one of which originates from the N terminus, in class I structure. Based on the x-ray structure of HFBII and the x-ray structures of native and variant forms of HFBI (PDB codes 2FZ6, 2GVM) (11Hakanpää J. Szilvay G. Kaljunen H. Maksimainen M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2129-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), which is also a class II hydrophobin from T. reesei, we have previously proposed that oligomerization in solution is an important property of hydrophobins. Hydrophobins seem to oligomerize via the hydrophobic surface areas in order to conceal the hydrophobic areas from the solvent. This also explains why hydrophobins are readily soluble in water. The solution behavior of HFBI and HFBII has been studied with the use of Förster resonance energy transfer and size exclusion chromatography (12Szilvay G. Nakari-Setälä T. Linder M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8590-8598Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with the conclusion that the preferred oligomerization state is a tetramer, while monomers and dimers are also observed. Crystallographic results show dimeric and tetrameric structures and the tetrameric structure indicates that the tetramer is composed of two dimers (11Hakanpää J. Szilvay G. Kaljunen H. Maksimainen M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2129-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Similar results related to oligomerization have been reported for class I hydrophobin SC3 from S. commune(13Wang X. Graveland-Biker J. de Kruif C. Robillard G. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 810-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), for which the primary oligomerization state was determined to be a dimer. However, the experiments with SC3 were conducted at lower protein concentrations in comparison to the experiments with HFBI and HFBII, while the oligomerization process is also thought to be a concentration-dependent phenomenon. The natural function of hydrophobins is to form amphiphilic layers on the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfaces. How these layers are formed from the building blocks that originate from the solution is the key problem we wish to examine here. Another matter that has received a vast amount of attention is the formation of a rodlet structure on the hydrophilic surface of the assembled layers of class I, but not class II, hydrophobins. These rodlets have been identified as amyloidal, because they are stained by the amyloid-specific dyes Congo Red and thioflavin and the appearance of the rodlet resembles that of amyloid fibrils (14Wösten H. de Vocht M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Biomembr. 2000; 1469: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Even though the rodlet formation is specific to class I hydrophobins only, fibrils are also formed by class II hydrophobins (15Torkkeli M. Serimaa R. Ikkala O. Linder M. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 2240-2247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe a fiber structure, possibly similar to fibrils and/or rodlets, observed in the new, orthorhombic crystal form of HFBII. Crystallization—The protein was produced and purified as described previously (16Hakanpää J. Parkkinen T. Hakulinen N. Linder M. Rouvinen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 163-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The protein was crystallized at room temperature using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. The crystallization solution contained 0.1 m lithium sulfate, 20% polyethylene glycol (MW 2000), and 0.1 m Tris buffer at pH 8.5. The pH of the crystallization solution was 8.48 and 6.91 for the crystals of space groups P21 and P212121, respectively. The crystallization drops contained 4 μl of crystallization solution, 1 μl of 300 mm detergent (heptyl-β-d-thioglycoside), and 5 μl of hydrophobin, dissolved in pure water at a concentration of 8 mg/ml. Streak seeding was used to produce the monoclinic crystals. Data Collection—The cryoprotection protocol for monoclinic crystals involved equilibrating the crystallization drop over a reservoir containing the crystallization solution with an elevated (30%) polyethylene glycol 2000 concentration for 19 h. The diffusion method, rather than soaking, was used as the cryoprotection protocol and this improved the diffraction quality of the monoclinic crystal form remarkably, from 3.1 to 2.2 Å. The orthorhombic crystals were cryoprotected by a brief soak in the crystallization solution with the concentration of polyethylene glycol 2000 increased to 30%. The data collection statistics are presented in Table 1. Due to overloads caused by the high resolution, the data for the orthorhombic crystals were collected in two passes.TABLE 1Statistics of data collection and refinementCrystal formMonoclinicOrthorombica (Å)61.0825.3b (Å)66.4157.1c (Å)79.7772.1β (o)99.2390.0Space groupP21P212121SourceID14-3, ESRFX12, EMBLWavelength (Å)0.9310.900Resolution range (Å)20-2.2 (2.5-2.2)20-1.0 (1.2-1.0)No. of observations145265365515No. of unique reflections61949 (19671)107245 (44537)Completeness (%)98.6 (98.4)98.3 (96.9)Rmeans (%)11.9 (40.2)12.0 (30.9)I/σ(I)7.70 (3.10)8.82 (3.89)R (%)22.412.5Rfree (%)28.015.2Rmsd bond length (Å)0.9950.014Rmsd bond angle (o)1.3632.289No. protein atoms4033963No. of water molecules521149No. of other atoms5724Average B-factor (Å2)33.310.2 Open table in a new tab Data Processing—Both the data sets were processed with the XDS program (17Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3243) Google Scholar). Structure determination was straightforward, because the structure of HFBII had already been solved in space group C2 (8Hakanpää J. Paananen A. Askolin S. Nakari-Setälä T. Parkkinen T. Penttilä M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The molecular replacement was carried out using the program Phaser (18McCoy A. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Storoni L. Read R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar) in the CCP4 interface (19Collaborative Computational Project Number 4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), using one molecule of the previously solved HFBII structure as a search model. Data Refinement—The data were refined with the CNS (20Brünger A. Adams P. Clore G. DeLano W. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R. Jiang J. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N. Read R. Rice L. Simonson T. Warren G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) and SHELXL (21Sheldrick G. Schneider T. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 319-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (1892) Google Scholar) programs for monoclinic and orthorhombic data, respectively. Program O (22Jones T. Zhou J. Cowan S. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Found. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) was used to inspect the electron density maps. For the atomic resolution data of the orthorhombic crystals, hydrogens were included in the refinement and anisotropic displacement parameters were refined. Hydrogen atoms were introduced as “riding” on a parent atom, and their temperature factors were not allowed to freely refine. Therefore, the atomic positions of the hydrogens were not included in the coordinate file deposited at the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. The Monoclinic Crystal Form of HFBII—The structure of the monoclinic crystal form has been deposited with the PDB under code 2PL6. The structure included eight protein molecules, polypeptide chains assigned from A to H, each consisting of 71 amino acid residues, three detergent molecules (heptyl-β-d-thioglucoside), and 521 molecules of water. Six residues (Ile-22 in molecule C, Thr-28 in molecules D and H, and Gln-65 in molecules A, E, and F) showed density indicative of being ordered into two positions; two conformations for these residues were included into the model. The structures of individual hydrophobin molecules were very similar to those that have been previously described (8Hakanpää J. Paananen A. Askolin S. Nakari-Setälä T. Parkkinen T. Penttilä M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, a structural change was identified in some of the molecules at the area of Ala-55-Ala-61 (Ala-60-Ala-66 in the HFBI sequence). Here, the position of the main chain in the middle of this area differs by 7-11 Å from that typically observed. Molecules B, D, F, and G of the monoclinic HFBII structure harbor this structural change. In all of the molecules A-H, the corresponding area was slightly disordered and the temperature factors were higher than elsewhere in the structure. Fig. 1 shows the area of Ala-55-Ala-61 superimposed for all molecules (A-H). Molecules B, F, and G in the HFBII structure are in a similar, extended conformation. Molecules A, C, E, and H are in a similar conformation to each other; this conformation is that previously observed for HFBII at an ultra-high resolution. However, molecule D has the area Ala-55-Ala-61 in a conformation that is between the closed and the extended conformation. Most likely, judging by the high temperature factors in this area for all of the molecules, several conformations are present in each molecule, but only the predominant one is presented in the model. The conformational change in molecules B, F, and G also resulted in a slight change in the secondary structure of the protein; the fourth β-strand was shortened from 8 residues (59-66) to 3 (64-66), which decreased the β-sheet content of the structure from 37 to 31%. The functional site of hydrophobins, a hydrophobic patch consisting of the side chains of residues Leu-7, Val-18, Leu-19, Leu-21, Ile-22, Val-24, Val-54, Ala-55, Val-57, Ala-58, Ala-61, Leu-62, and Leu-63, was located on the protein surface as previously described (8Hakanpää J. Paananen A. Askolin S. Nakari-Setälä T. Parkkinen T. Penttilä M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The three detergent molecules that originated from the crystallization solution were coordinated between two hydrophobin molecules in the region of the hydrophobic patches. The electron density produced by the detergent molecules (Fig. 2a) was ambiguous and the temperature factors remained high, despite the evident presence of the detergents. This is likely due to the detergent molecules being slightly disordered because of their structural flexibility. At fairly low resolution, it was also difficult to distinguish between clusters of water and detergent molecules. Indeed, some residual density remained in clearly hydrophobic locations, indicating that partially occupied detergent sites may have been left unmodeled. The eight molecules of the asymmetric unit were packed in two rows and arranged in the shape of a horseshoe (Fig. 2b). The crystal packing resulted in the formation of a layer structure when the helical parts of the molecules packed together in an anti-parallel fashion and the hydrophobic surface areas within one layer all pointed in the same direction, thus creating a larger hydrophobic surface. The detergent molecules were packed between the hydrophobic surface areas of two neighboring asymmetric units (Fig. 2c). When the layer structure is viewed in a perpendicular direction, a very symmetrical packing of six-membered rings, formed by hydrophobin molecules, can be observed (Fig. 2d). The diameter of these rings is ∼62 Å. The ring is slightly tilted; in other words, it winds up in a manner typical of helical structures. The Orthorhombic Crystal Form of HFBII—The structure of the orthorhombic crystal form has been deposited at the PDB under code 2PL7. The structure contained two molecules of hydrophobin HFBII, designated A and B, one detergent molecule, a sulfate ion, and 149 molecules of water. No conformational changes were observed in this structure. The C termini were found to be either degraded or so flexible that some of the residues could not be seen in the electron density maps. The three C-terminal residues were not fitted to the model due to lack of electron density; thus, the sequences end with Ala-67. The electron density for the heptyl-β-d-thioglycoside was weak yet clearly visible, and therefore the detergent molecule was modeled with 50% occupancy (Fig. 3d). The detergent was coordinated in the vicinity of the hydrophobic patches. Some residual density, quite likely caused by partial presence of another detergent molecule, was seen elsewhere but also close to the hydrophobic surface areas. However, this density was too ambiguous for a detergent molecule to fit it. The two molecules of the asymmetric unit formed a dimer in such a way that contact between the molecules was made through the N-terminal loops, the first β-hairpin loop, and the fourth β-strand. This contact resulted in the hydrophobic surface areas being located close together on one side of a dimer, creating a shared hydrophobic surface (Fig. 3a). More of these dimers packed together sideways, in the same rotation angle and only by translation of one unit along the x-axes. In this way, an elongated structure was created, with a shared, continuous hydrophobic surface (Fig. 3b). On top of this surface there was, in very close contact, a symmetrical row of molecules, with a symmetry matrix x+1/2 -y+1/2 -z relating the molecules to x, y, z and the row being continuous with the translation of one unit along the x-axes (Fig. 3c). The interaction between these two elongated chains was through the areas of the hydrophobic surface patch. The packing through the hydrophobic patch proceeded in a zigzag pattern: molecule A was in contact with molecule B of an adjacent dimer through the hydrophobic surface and molecule B was in contact with molecule A of another adjacent dimer. Thus, this kind of packing led to a fiber-like structure, with most of the hydrophobic surface areas buried inside the fiber. The entire crystal was composed of these fibers packed close together. However, the interactions between adjacent fibers were considerably weaker than within a fiber. Only a small portion of the hydrophobic patches was left exposed to the solvent after the formation of the fiber structure and close-packing through the hydrophobic surface areas. This hydrophobic pocket hosted the carbon tail of the detergent molecule. The Conformational Change—Some structural flexibility was found in the primitive monoclinic structure of HFBII at the area of Ala-55-Ala-61 (Fig. 1). A similar conformational change was previously observed for HFBI (11Hakanpää J. Szilvay G. Kaljunen H. Maksimainen M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2129-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This type of change has only been observed when class II hydrophobins have been crystallized in the presence of a detergent and also only on half of the molecules in the asymmetric unit. The precise function of the conformational change is not evident from the crystal structures. It could be hypothesized that the movement is driven by an attempt to adjust the position of the hydrophobic patch in relation to the hydrophobic substrate, as with the previously observed plasticity in the molecular structure of hydrophobins (11Hakanpää J. Szilvay G. Kaljunen H. Maksimainen M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2129-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of the class I hydrophobin EAS from N. crassa (10Kwan A. Winefield R. Sunde M. Matthews J. Haverkamp R. Templeton M. Mackay J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) contains two unstructured loop regions, Met-22-Ser-42 and Val-65-Phe-72. The latter, smaller area may partially coincide with the area of the conformational change observed in class II hydrophobin structures, because both of these areas lay between the last 2 cysteine residues in the sequence. The disordered regions in the EAS structure concern 29 residues (35%) while 7 residues (10%) are involved in the conformational change in HFBI and HFBII structures. It remains slightly unclear whether the loop areas of the EAS are truly disordered or just undefined by NMR, because earlier NMR results (23Mackay J. Matthews J. Winefield R. Mackay L. Haverkamp R. Templeton M. Structure. 2001; 9: 83-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) indicated that the entire protein is largely unstructured. In addition, it is not possible to model the unstructured areas using the crystals structures of class II hydrophobins, because the loops are significantly larger in size in class I hydrophobins. Oligomer Formation and the Mechanism of Function—Hydrophobins are typically readily soluble in water. We have previously proposed that oligomerization is the mechanism of how hydrophobins remain soluble despite the amphiphilicity of the molecules, and we have described the energetic principles as the driving force of the self-assembly (8Hakanpää J. Paananen A. Askolin S. Nakari-Setälä T. Parkkinen T. Penttilä M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 534-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 11Hakanpää J. Szilvay G. Kaljunen H. Maksimainen M. Linder M. Rouvinen J. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 2129-2140Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In the previous crystal structures of hydrophobins the governing interactions between the protein molecules have occurred via the hydrophobic surface areas. For the first time, in the orthorhombic crystal structure presented in this report a type of tight interaction, likely similar to a lateral interaction in the amphiphilic layer, is observed. The two molecules in the asymmetric unit form a closely packed dimer that does not bury the hydrophobic surface areas but aligns them on one side of the dimer (Fig. 4, b and e). When this amphiphilic dimer is superimposed on the tetramer with hydrophobic interaction (Fig. 4, d and e), its position is close to that of two non-dimeric molecules (just slightly tilted), which originate from two different constituent dimers. We suppose that the monomeric HFBII (Fig. 4, a and e) oligomerizes in solution first to dimers held together by hydrophobic interaction (Fig. 4, c and e) and then further forms tetramers by combining two dimers. The tetramer may break down to a dimer similar to that in the orthorhombic crystal structure. This dimer has the hydrophobic surface patches of both molecules aligned on one side of the dimer, ready to interact with the hydrophobic surface. The amphiphilic dimer is then incorporated to the assembly on the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface or (in the presence of an excess amount of hydrophobin) to the fibril structure. A schematic representation of the complete mechanism of function is shown in Fig. 5.FIGURE 5The mechanism of the function for hydrophobins, schematic representation. Monomers multimerize to dimers, two of which form a tetramer. The tetramer may split into two new dimers with hydrophobic surface areas aligned. These amphiphilic dimers precede the formation of amphiphilic monolayer on hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. At high concentration, excess hydrophobin forms fibril structures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interfacial Structures—Both class I and II hydrophobins form amphiphilic layer structures, with the distinction that class I layers are more resistant to dissociation and the class I layers show a rodlet-like surface pattern. For class II hydrophobins, the surface of the layer appears to be smooth, but closer examination by atomic force microscopy reveals that it actually has an ordered pattern of small pores (26Paananen A.

Laurikainen K. Vuorimaa E. Lemmetyinen H. Peltonen J. Linder M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2345-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The basic building block in these films is a parallelogram of ∼60 Å and the diameter of the micropores in the structure is 10-20 Å (27Szilvay G. Paananen A. Laurikainen K. Vuorimaa E. Lemmetyinen H. Peltonen J. Linder M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2345-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 28Serimaa R. Torkkeli M. Paananen A. Linder M. Kisko K. Knaapila M. Ikkala O. Vuorimaa E. Lemmetyinen H. Seeck O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 499-502Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The appearance of the films in the atomic force microscopy images of HFBII (supplemental data) and the dimension of the building blocks and pores are strikingly similar to those found in the primitive monoclinic crystal structure of HFBII (ring diameter 60 Å, pore size 20 Å). The hydrophobic surface areas of hydrophobin molecules in this crystal structure are aligned to create an amphiphilic layer structure. Viewed perpendicular to the aligned hydrophobic surface, the structure mimics a primitive, hexagonal lattice in two dimensions and relates to structures observed by atomic force microscopy. Therefore, we propose that the structure of the assembled hydrophobin monolayer is similar to that of one layer in the crystal structure of HFBII in the primitive monoclinic space group. Also, an interaction similar to that of the amphiphilic dimer (orthorhombic structure) is found in the primitive monoclinic structure (Fig. 4f), indicating that the amphiphilic dimer might be a building block for the interfacial structures. The porous structure of the assembled hydrophobin layer, as suggested here, would also agree very well with the finding that the layers are permeable for small molecules (29Wang X. Shi F. Wösten H. Hektor H. Poolman B. Robillard G. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3434-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Alignment of hydrophobic surface areas necessitates favorable lateral interactions in the hydrophobin assembly. In the orthorhombic crystal structures, residues Pro-4, Phe-8, Asp-20, and Gln-65 interact between the two molecules of the asymmetric unit, whereas Thr-16, Asn-17, and Asp-20 tie together the two dimers in the side-by-side manner of the fiber formation. In the primitive monoclinic structure, residues Pro-4, Phe-8, Thr-16, Asp-20, and Gln-65 participate in contacts between the molecules of the asymmetric unit. Residues Pro-29, Thr-30, and Pro-56 mediate the packing of adjacent ring-like structures in the primitive monoclinic structure of HFBII, whereas Asp-59 and Gln-60 seem to strengthen the interaction when the hydrophobic patches pack close together in the orthorhombic fiber-like structure. All the residues involved in the lateral interactions are well conserved in class II hydrophobin sequences and have no other apparent reason for conservation other than the involvement in lateral interactions. Whether the assembled amphiphilic layer is a mono- or multilayer of hydrophobins is not clear. For films of hydrophobin HFBI on a water droplet, the thickness of the dried surface layer has been determined to be 1.1-3.0 nm (28Serimaa R. Torkkeli M. Paananen A. Linder M. Kisko K. Knaapila M. Ikkala O. Vuorimaa E. Lemmetyinen H. Seeck O. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2003; 36: 499-502Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar), indicating a monolayer. Also, judging by the detergent-mediated layer structure in the primitive monoclinic crystal form, it would seem that multilayers would require additional hydrophobic moieties, i.e. the detergent, in order to form. For class I hydrophobin SC3, the formation of both 10- and 3-nm-thick layers has been reported (29Wang X. Shi F. Wösten H. Hektor H. Poolman B. Robillard G. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3434-3443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Wösten H. de Vries O. Wessels J. Plant Cell. 1993; 5: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), indicating multi- and monolayer, respectively. The formation of the layer is said to be concentration-dependent, and it has been found for SC3 that a featureless film is formed first and that after overnight incubation the 10-nm film with rodlet patterning forms (25de Vocht M. Reviakine I. Ulrich W. Bergsma-Schutter W. Wösten H. Vogel H. Brisson A. Wessels J. Robillard G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In relation to the thickness of hydrophobin films, it is also noteworthy that SC3 is heavily glycosylated (31Wösten H. de Vries O. van der Mei H. Busscher H. Wessels J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7085-7086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas HFBI (32Nakari-Setälä T. Aro N. Kalkkinen N. Alatalo E. Penttilä M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 235: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), HFBII (33Nakari-Setälä T. Aro N. Ilmén M. Muños G. Kalkkinen N. Penttilä M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and EAS (23Mackay J. Matthews J. Winefield R. Mackay L. Haverkamp R. Templeton M. Structure. 2001; 9: 83-91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) are not. Glycosylations add to the thickness of the layer and affect the surface pattern on the hydrophilic side. Fibril Formation—The basic structural unit in the orthorhombic structure is an amphiphilic dimer. These dimers are packed in a fiber-like array throughout the crystal. These fibers are mostly hydrophilic on the surface and their diameter is ∼55 Å. We propose that this fiber-like array (Fig. 3c) is, in fact, the structure of fibrils observed for class II hydrophobins. The fibrils are formed upon vigorous shaking and appear to be a way to efficiently conceal the hydrophobic surface areas when an excess amount of hydrophobin is present. It is not known how the fibrils formed by class II hydrophobins are related to the rodlets formed by class I hydrophobins, if they are in any way. Rodlets have been observed on the hydrophobic side of the self-assembled films of class I hydrophobins (24Ma H. Snook L. Tian C. Kaminskyj S. Dahms T. Mycol. Res. 2006; 110: 879-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and it has recently been reported for class I hydrophobin SC3 that during the self-assembly a featureless film is formed first and that after overnight incubation a 10-nm film with rodlet patterning forms (25de Vocht M. Reviakine I. Ulrich W. Bergsma-Schutter W. Wösten H. Vogel H. Brisson A. Wessels J. Robillard G. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 1199-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This supports the idea that the formation of fibrils and rodlets is more of an artifact of hydrophobin surface properties, a way to preserve excess hydrophobin molecules, than a functionally meaningful phenomenon. A theoretical, amphiphilic fiber structure has been proposed for class I hydrophobin EAS (10Kwan A. Winefield R. Sunde M. Matthews J. Haverkamp R. Templeton M. Mackay J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 3621-3626Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). In this model, the β-barrels of adjacent molecules are aligned, creating a fibril with a diameter of 25 Å. Folding of the disordered loops into β-strands is assumed, even though the β-strand formation results in the majority of the hydrophobic residues in the disordered loop region being placed in the solvent phase. This seems energetically unfavorable and diminishes the credibility of the model. Due to the similarities in the folding of the individual hydrophobin molecules, we feel that it is well possible that the rodlets of class I hydrophobins have a similar structure to that of the HFBII fiber. Whether the fiber formed of class I hydrophobins would be amphiphilic or not depends on the fold of the loop areas that currently remain unresolved. The two crystal structures described in this report have given clear indications with regard to major issues in hydrophobin research. These structures have allowed us to build an energetically reasonable pathway, starting from a soluble molecule and ending with an amphiphilic layer. The crystal structures also indicated how the layers and fibril structures may be constructed of their building blocks, the hydrophobin molecules. However, it still needs to be clarified how the loop areas in class I hydrophobins are structured before we can make full comparisons of the two hydrophobin classes.

Glucosamine (GS) is an amino monosaccharide and has been widely used for alternative regimen of (osteo) arthritis. However, the mechanism of action of GS on COX-2 expression remains unclear. Here we describe a new action mechanism of glucosamine hydrochloride (GS-HCl) to tackle endogenous and agonistdriven COX-2 at protein level. GS-HCl (but not GS sulfate, N-acetyl GS, or galactosamine HCl) resulted in a shift in the molecular mass of COX-2 from 72–74 to 66–70 kDa and concomitant inhibition of prostaglandin E2 production in a concentration-dependent manner in interleukin (IL)-1β-treated A549 human lung epithelial cells. Remarkably, GS-HCl-mediated decrease in COX-2 molecular mass was associated with inhibition of COX-2 N-glycosylation during translation, as assessed by the effect of tunicamycin, the protein N-glycosylation inhibitor, or of cycloheximide, the translation inhibitor, on COX-2 modification. Specifically, the effect of low concentration of GS-HCl (1 mm) or of tunicamycin (0.1 μg/ml) to produce the aglycosylated COX-2 was rescued by the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 but not by the lysosomal or caspase inhibitors. However, the proteasomal inhibitors did not show an effect at 5 mm GS-HCl, which produced the aglycosylated or completely deglycosylated form of COX-2. Notably, GS-HCl (5 mm) also facilitated degradation of the higher molecular species of COX-2 in IL-1β-treated A549 cells that was retarded by MG132. GS-HCl (5 mm) was also able to decrease the molecular mass of endogenous and IL-1β- or tumor necrosis factor-α-driven COX-2 in different human cell lines, including Hep2 (bronchial) and H292 (laryngeal). However, GS-HCl did not affect COX-1 protein expression. These results demonstrate for the first time that GS-HCl inhibits COX-2 activity by preventing COX-2 co-translational N-glycosylation and by facilitating COX-2 protein turnover during translation in a proteasome-dependent manner.

If excessive, however, PGs play a pathogenic role in many chronic inflammatory and neoplastic diseases (1Smith W.L. Dewitt D.L. Adv.

COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most cells, and COX-1-derived PGs are involved in the maintenance of physiological functions. On the other hand, COX-2 is inducible by pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumor promoters, mitogenes, oncogenes, and growth factors in many types of cells, including monocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells (1Smith W.L.

Evidence that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or compounds that target COX-2 lessen major inflammatory symptoms such as fever and pain suggests a role for COX-2 in inflammation (6Williams G.W. Curr. Pain Headache Rep. 2005; 9: 377-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). COX-2 expression is regulated at transcription, post-transcription, and translation. COX-2 transcription is induced by various exogenous stimuli that regulate intracellular signaling pathways that in turn modulate the activity of transcription factors and hence stimulate the COX-2 promoter (7Herschman H.R. Reddy S.T. Xie W. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 407: 61-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclic AMP-responsive element, nuclear factor-interleukin 6, and NF-κB cis-acting elements were shown to be important for transcriptional COX-2 induction (8Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M.

In addition, activities of MAPKs, including ERKs, p38 MAPK, and JNKs, were reported to be important for COX-2 expression (13Chen W. Tang Q. Gonzales M.S. Bowden G.T.

Of interest, it has been previously shown that inhibition of COX-2 N-glycosylation by site-directed mutagenesis or tunicamycin (TN), a protein N-glycosylation inhibitor, results in expression of COX-2 with the reduced molecular mass and activity (17Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the importance of this co-translational modification in COX-2 enzyme catalysis.Glucosamine (GS) is an amino monosaccharide and has been widely used as an alternative regimen for rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis. Recent in vivo studies have shown that GS salts, including GS sulfate or GS-HCl, have preventive actions on adjuvant arthritis in rats (18Hua J. Suguro S. Hirano S. Sakamoto K. Nagaoka I. Inflamm. Res. 2005; 54: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), possess the significant symptom-modifying effect on osteoarthritis in long term human clinical trials (19Reginster J.Y. Deroisy R.

Orth M.W. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2000; 8: 258-265Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, many recent in vitro studies have demonstrated that GS-HCl suppresses IL-1β-induced COX-2 expression by decreasing COX-2 transcript level in chondrocytes and synoviocytes (21Nakamura H. Shibakawa A. Tanaka M. Kato T. Nishioka K. Clin. Exp. Rheumatol. 2004; 22: 293-299PubMed Google Scholar), and that GS sulfate inhibits IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation in human osteoarthritic chondrocytes (22Largo R. Alvarez-Soria M.A. Diez-Ortego I. Calvo E. Sanchez-Pernaute O. Egido J. Herrero-Beaumont G.

From these, it is suggested that GS exerts its anti-inflammatory effect in part through transcriptional down-regulation of various genes involved in inflammation, cell adhesion, matrix degradation, and/or migration. However, the action mechanism by which GS affects expression and activity of COX-2 is not fully understood.In this study, we evaluated the effects of different GS salts (GS-HCl, GS sulfate) or a GS derivative (N-acetyl GS) and galactosamine HCl (Gal-HCl), another hexosamine, on the expression of COX-2 and production of PGE2 by IL-1β in A549 human lung epithelial cells. Here we demonstrate for the first time a new mechanism of GS-HCl to specifically inhibit endogenous and agonist-driven COX-2 at protein level.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen. Fetal bovine serum was from Hyclone. GS-HCl, GS sulfate, N-acetyl GS, Gal-HCl, chloroquine diphosphate salt (CQ), calpain inhibitor I (ALLN), benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD), N-acetyl-Leu-Glu-Val-Asp-CHO trifluoroacetate salt (LEVD), TN, TNF-α, and actin antibody were from Sigma. NS398 and antibodies against COX-1 or COX-2 were from Cayman. MG132 was purchased from Calbiochem. An anti-O-linked GlcNAc monoclonal antibody RL2 was from Affinity BioReagents. Antibodies against anti-rabbit or mouse secondary horseradish peroxidase, ECL Western detection reagents, and PGE2 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit were from Amersham Biosciences. Actinomycin D and cycloheximide (CHX) were from Biomol. Bradford reagent was from Bio-Rad. Antibodies against phospho-ERKs (p-ERKs), phospho-JNKs (p-JNKs), and phospho-p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK) were from Cell Signaling Tech. Antibody against IκB-α was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PUGNAc, an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase, was from CARBO GEN. IL-1β was from R & D Systems.Cell Lines-Human cell lines used included A549 (lung), H292 (bronchial), and Hep2 (laryngeal). A549 and H292 cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Hep2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Preparation of Whole Cell Lysates-Briefly, the cells were pretreated for 1 h with GS-HCl, GS sulfate, N-acetyl GS, Gal-HCl, NS398, TN, or PUGNAc and then exposed to IL-1β or TNF-α for 4 h. For the inhibition study, A549 cells were pretreated for 0.5 h with GS-HCl or TN. After removing the conditioned medium, the cells were once more exposed for 0.5 h to GS-HCl or TN plus respective inhibitor such as MG132, CQ, ALLN, Z-VAD, or LEVD. After pretreatment with drugs, the cells were then treated for 4 h with IL-1β and GS-HCl or TN plus respective inhibitor. After treatment, the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 1mm NaF and lysed in a modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 200 nm aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 50 μm phenanthroline, 280 μm benzamidine-HCl). The supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and its protein concentration was then determined.Western Blot Analysis-Equal amounts of proteins (40 μg/lane) were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred onto membrane (Millipore). The membrane was then washed with Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) and blocked in TBST containing 5% nonfat dried milk. The membrane was then incubated with antibodies of COX-1 (1:500), COX-2 (1:2,000), actin (1:10,000), p-JNKs (1:1000), p-ERKs (1:2000), p-p38 MAPK (1:2000), GRP78 (1:1,000), RL2 (1:1,000), or IκB-α (1:2,000). The membrane was then exposed to secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase and developed in the ECL Western detection reagents.PGE2 Assay-PGE2 was measured using the PGE2 enzymelinked immunosorbent assay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Briefly, 7 × 105 cells plated were pretreated with GS-HCl or NS-398, a COX-2-specific inhibitor, for 1 h and then treated with IL-1β for additional 4 h in the absence or presence of GS-HCl or NS-398. The conditioned medium was collected and subjected to PGE2 assay in a 96-well plate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Principally, the product of this enzymatic reaction has a blue color that absorbs at 450 nm. The extent of color is inversely proportional to the amount of free PGE2 present in the well during the incubation.Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR-Total RNA was isolated with the RNAzol-B (Tel-Test). Three micrograms of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Single-stranded cDNA was amplified by PCR with sequences of the following primers: COX-2 sense, 5′-TTGAAGACCAGGAGTACAGC-3′; COX-2 antisense, 5′-GGTACAGTTCCATGACATCG-3′; GAPDH sense, 5′-GGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACG-3′; and GAPDH antisense, 5′-GGTAGGAACACGGAAGGCCA-3′. The PCR conditions applied were: COX-2, 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 52 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s; and GAPDH, 18 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 57 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. GAPDH was used as an internal control to evaluate the relative expression of COX-2.Determination of COX-2 mRNA Stability-A549 cells were initially grown in the absence or presence of IL-1β for 4 h to highly induce endogenous COX-2 mRNA in A549 cells. The cells were then treated with IL-1β alone or IL-1β plus GS-HCl in the presence of actinomycin D, a transcription inhibitor, to block ongoing transcription for additional 1, 2, 4, or 8 h. At each time, total RNA was isolated and subjected to COX-2 or GAPDH RT-PCR to determine the amounts of each mRNA that remained in the cells.Determination of COX-2 Protein Stability-A549 cells were initially grown in the absence or presence of IL-1β for 4 h to highly induce endogenous COX-2 protein in A549 cells. The cells were then treated with IL-1β alone or IL-1β plus GS-HCl for 2, 4, or 8 h in the absence or presence of CHX, a translation inhibitor. At each time, whole cell lysate was prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis for COX-2 or actin to determine the amounts of each protein that remained in the cells.Statistical Analysis-The results are expressed as the means ± S.E., and the significance of difference was determined by Student's t test.

As shown in Fig. 1A, IL-1β induced high COX-2 protein (lane 3) compared with control (lane 1). Treatment of cells with low concentrations of GS-HCl (0.01 and 0.1 mm) had no effect on expression of COX-2 protein induced by IL-1β (lanes 4 and 5). In contrast, treatment of cells with relatively high concentrations of GS-HCl (1–5 mm) led to the expression of COX-2 protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼66–70 kDa (lanes 6–8) as compared with the normally expressed 72–74-kDa protein (lane 3). Notably, treatment with GS-HCl at 5mm led to strong accumulation of a distinct COX-2 with ∼66 kDa (lane 8, marked with arrow). Of interest, A549 cells also expressed substantial levels of endogenous COX-1 protein that was not affected by IL-1β (Fig. 1A). Moreover, treatment with GS-HCl at concentrations used (0.01–5 mm) had no effect on the expression of COX-1 protein. Expression of actin protein was also not affected by GS-HCl, suggesting the specificity of GS-HCl to modify COX-2 at protein level. Remarkably, GS-HCl did not affect IL-1β-mediated expression of steady-state COX-2 mRNA (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1B, kinetic studies further demonstrated that pretreatment with GS-HCl (5 mm) did not affect newly synthesizing COX-2 mRNA expression (lanes 1–9) but led to the expression of COX-2 with mostly 66 kDa (marked with arrow) in A549 cells upon treatment with IL-1β in different times, indicating that GS-HCl does affect nascent COX-2 protein synthesis. Expression of either actin protein or GAPDH mRNA was also not affected by GS-HCl at times tested (Fig. 1B). To see whether GS-HCl-modified COX-2 is functional, the effect of GS-HCl on the production of PGE2, a major and stable COX-2 metabolite, in IL-1β-treated A549 cells was next investigated. As shown in Fig. 1C, IL-1β increased PGE2 production and COX-2 protein (lane 4) compared with control (lane 1), indicating that COX-2 induced by IL-1β is functional. NS398 was used as a positive control to assess the efficacy of GS-HCl to inhibit COX-2 activity. As anticipated, NS398 did not affect expression of COX-2 protein but almost completely inhibited PGE2 production in IL-1β-treated A549 cells (lane 8), suggesting the efficacy of NS398 to inactivate COX-2. Importantly, there was a concentration-dependent trend in the decreased molecular mass of COX-2 and PGE2 production in IL-1β-treated A549 cells following GS-HCl treatment (lanes 5–7). In particular, there was ∼40 and 90% inhibition of PGE2 production by GS-HCl at 1 and 5 mm, respectively. These results collectively suggest a correlation between the reduction of COX-2 molecular mass and the loss of COX-2 activity following GS-HCl treatment. Compared with GS-HCl (Fig. 1D, lane 3), however, GS sulfate, N-acetyl GS, or Gal-HCl did not influence the expression of COX-2 protein in IL-1β-treated A549 cells (Fig. 1D, lanes 4–6). Taken together, these results demonstrate that GS-HCl specifically inhibit COX-2 by decreasing its molecular mass and activity in IL-1β-treated A549 cells.The Effect of GS-HCl to Decrease the Molecular Mass of COX-2 Is Unrelated with Protein O-Glycosylation and MAPKs Phosphorylation or NF-κB Pathway-The dynamic competition between protein glycosylation and phosphorylation has been reported (24Whelan S.A. Hart G.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). GS is shown to inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate-1 and -2 in response to insulin signal that is associated with increased O-glycosylation of these proteins (25D'Alessandris C. Andreozzi F. Federici M. Cardellini M. Brunetti A. Ranalli M. Guerra Del FASEB J. 2004; 18: 959-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been reported that prolonged incubation of PUGNAc, an inhibitor of O-GlcNAcase that cleaves O-linked glycan groups and not N-linked glycans from glycoproteins, results in increased O-glycosylation of cellular proteins (26Arias E.B. Kim J. Cartee G.D. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Using PUGNAc, we next asked whether the effect of GS-HCl on lowering the molecular mass of COX-2 is associated with the ability of GS-HCl to modulate protein O-glycosylation and/or phosphorylation in response to IL-1β. An anti-O-linked GlcNAc monoclonal antibody RL2 specific for O-glycosylated protein(s) was used. As shown in Fig. 2A, RL2 recognized many endogenous O-glycosylated proteins in A549 cells (lane 1). IL-1β alone did not affect the O-glycosylated proteins in A549 cells (lane 4). Apparently, GS-HCl (lane 2) or PUGNAc (lane 3) augmented or induced the O-glycosylated proteins in A549 cells (marked with arrow). Overall, PUGNAc enhanced or induced higher O-glycosylated proteins in IL-1β-treated A549 cells (lane 6) than GS-HCl (lane 5). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 2B, whereas GS-HCl led to decrease in the molecular mass of COX-2 in IL-1β-treated A549 cells (lane 5, marked with arrow), PUGNAc did not (lane 6). Notably, although low, A549 cells also expressed endogenous COX-2 protein (lane 1). Interestingly, GS-HCl was able to decrease the molecular mass of this endogenous COX-2 (lane 2), suggesting the ability of GS-HCl to modify both endogenous COX-2 and agonist (IL-1β)-driven COX-2. Actin level was not affected by treatment with GS-HCl or PUGNAc tested. It has been reported that IL-1β signals to increase phosphorylation (activation) of many signaling proteins, including ERKs, p38 MAPK, and JNKs, and their activations are necessary for the cytokine-induced COX-2 expression (27Liu W. Reinmuth N. Stoeltzing O. Parikh A.A. Tellez C. Williams S. Jung Y.D. Fan F. Takeda A. Akagi M. Bar-Eli M. Gallick G.E. Ellis L.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3632-3636PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to test the effect of GS-HCl on protein phosphorylation in response to IL-1β. As shown in Fig. 3A, IL-1β stimulated or enhanced phosphorylation of ERK-1/2, JNK-1/2, and p38 MAPK in A549 cells (lane 3) without affecting the total protein level of ERK-1/2, JNK-1/2, or p38 MAPK (data not shown), suggesting the ability of IL-1β to increase phosphorylation of pre-existing ERK-1/2, JNK-1/2, or p38 MAPK. In IL-1β-treated A549 cells, GS-HCl had no effect on phosphorylation of ERK-1/2, JNK-1/2, and p38 MAPK (Fig. 3A, lane 4) but led to production of the low molecular mass of COX-2 (Fig. 3B, lane 4). Accordingly, IL-1β signals to degrade IκB-α, a cytosolic inhibitory protein of NF-κB, and the resultantly activated NF-κB are involved in COX-2 transcriptional induction in A549 cells (8Newton R. Kuitert L.M. Bergmann M. Adcock I.M. Barnes P.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 237: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). GS sulfate is reported to inhibit IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation in chondrocytes (22Largo R. Alvarez-Soria M.A. Diez-Ortego I. Calvo E. Sanchez-Pernaute O. Egido J. Herrero-Beaumont G. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2003; 11: 290-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). This led us to test whether GS-HCl affects IL-1β-mediated degradation of IκB-α in A549 cells. Distinctly, GS-HCl had no effect on IL-1β-mediated degradation of IκB-α (Fig. 3A, lane 4), suggesting that GS-HCl or GS sulfate may differentially regulate NF-κB activity in a cell-specific manner in response to IL-1β. Collectively, these results suggest that the effect of GS-HCl to decrease the molecular mass of COX-2 in IL-1β-treated A549 cells seems to be unrelated with protein O-glycosylation, MAPK phosphorylation, and/or NF-κB pathway.FIGURE 2Comparison of GS-HCl and PUGNAc on protein O-glycosylation and COX-2 expression in IL-1β-treated A549 cells. A549 cells were pretreated with GS-HCl or PUGNAc, an inhibitor of GTFase that eventually leads to increased protein O-glycosylation, for 1 h. The cells were then treated with IL-1β for 4 h in the absence or presence of GS-HCl or PUGNAc. Whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using an anti-O-linked GlcNAc monoclonal RL2 antibody that can detect O-glycosylated protein(s) (A) or antibodies for COX-2 or actin (B). In B, the arrow indicates expression of the reduced molecular mass of COX-2 (66 kDa) following GS-HCl treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3Effect of GS-HCl on MAPK phosphorylation, IκB-α degradation, and COX-2 expression in IL-1β-treated A549 cells.

Hochgesang G Jr P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3109-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Hla T. Neilson K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7384-7388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). The mass difference between 72 and 74 kDa COX-2 is suggested to be due to variance of the degree of N-glycosylation on Asn580 (15Nemeth J.F. Hochgesang G Jr P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3109-3116Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been recently shown that GS prevents N-glycosylation of certain proteins (29Davidson M.B. Hunt K. Fernandez-Mejia C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Qiu W. Avramoglu R.K. Rutledge A.C. Tsai J. Adeli K. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1749-1761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), including glucose transporter 1 and a lipoprotein apoB-100. From these, we speculated that GS-HCl-modified COX-2 molecular mass and activity (Fig. 1A, lanes 6–8) might be associated with COX-2 N-glycosylation. TN is shown to inhibit COX-2 N-glycosylation, resulting in expression of the aglycosylated COX-2 with lowered molecular mass (∼66 kDa) and activity (17Otto J.C. DeWitt D.L. Smith W.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18234-18242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, TN was used"

Here we show that the Drosophila ortholog of the CBP/p300 family of transcription co-activators, nejire (nej), is an intrinsic component of the circadian clock that performs regulatory functions for circadian controlled transcription. Screening of overexpression mutants revealed that gain of nej function was associated with a loss of behavioral and molecular rhythms. Overexpression of NEJ suppresses the long period phenotype of a mutation in the clock gene period (per). NEJ physically interacts through two binding sites with CLOCK and the CLOCK·CYCLE (CLK·CYC) complex. Induction of CLK·CYC-dependent transcripts upon induction of nej expression from a heat-shock promoter showed that NEJ is limiting. Reduced CLK·CYC-mediated transcription in a nej hypomorphic mutant indicates an essential function of NEJ/CBP for CLK·CYC activity and a regulation of circadian transcription by availability of the co-activator.

Shaw P.J. Science. 2006; 313: 1775-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). However, these pathways also feedback on the molecular oscillator at least in part through control of CLK·CYC activity (13Weber F. Kim H.C. Maurer C. Kay S.A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cross-talk between circadian and cell signaling may increase the robustness of circadian oscillations and allow a coordination of circadian transcription with physiological requirements. Previous studies showed that recruitment of the CREB-binding protein (CBP) from a limiting cellular pool mediates cross-talk between the transcription factors E2F, JAK/STAT, AP1, and nuclear hormone receptors (14Costa S.L.

Here we show that CLK·CYC-mediated transcription is also dependent on CBP, and importantly circadian transcription responds to changes in limiting levels of the co-activator. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for cross-talk between CLK·CYC and other CBP-dependent transcription factors.

Quantitative Real-time PCR (RT-PCR)—1–7-day old flies were harvested after incubation for at least 48 h in constant light at either constant 20 °C or after application of a 30-min heat shock at 37 °C. Heads were isolated and total RNA was purified by homogenization in peqGOLD TriFast (PEQLAB, Erlangen, Germany) following manufacturer's instructions. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with random hexamer primers using the Quantitect Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer's instructions. cDNA products were amplified in an ABI PRISM 7000 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

Western Blotting—CLK protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis as detailed in the legend of Fig. 4 using an antibody that was raised in rabbit against a peptide composed of the C-terminal 15 amino acids of CLK. Immunohistochemistry—Third instar larvae were entrained for 3 days in cycles of 12 h LD, and the brains were dissected during the first day of constant darkness at times indicated in the figures. Circadian time (CT) 0 marks time of subjective “lights on” and CT12 marks time of subjective “lights off”. The experiments were repeated twice, and for each time point at least 8 brains were dissected. Brains were fixed in 4% formaldehyde in PEM buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgSO4) for 2 h, blocked with 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in PT buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.3% Triton X-100) for 2 h at room temperature, and subsequently incubated for 48 h at 4 °C in 50 μl of primary antiserum solution containing 1:200 diluted rabbit anti-PER (Alpha Diagnostics, San Antonio, TX) and 1:1000 diluted guinea pig anti-PAP (20Renn S.C.

Brains were rinsed with PT buffer and PT plus 5% NGS for 20 min each and then incubated at room temperature for 2 h in secondary antiserum solution containing 1:200 diluted TRITC-conjugated donkey anti-guinea pig (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA) and 1:200 diluted fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (Calbiochem) in PT buffer with 10% NGS. After incubation, brains were rinsed with PT buffer and PT plus 5% NGS for 20 min each and mounted in the mounting medium (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8, 90% glycerol, 2.5% DABCO (Sigma)). Confocal Microscopy and Quantification of Staining—Optical sections of larval lateral neurons (LNs) were imaged on a Carl Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. For each CT, LNs from at least 16 brain hemispheres per fly strain were scanned. For each LN sample, PAP staining was used to identify and select an optical section, which was then scanned for PER immunoreactivity. Three images were taken per LN with single laser at 488 nm, 543 nm, and with both lasers together. Images taken with single 488-nm laser were imported to NIH ImageJ 1.34s, and the localization of neuronal PER staining was determined by the double-laser images. Total pixel intensity of PER staining was measured, and the mean ± S.E. of all brains at a particular CT is reported in the graphs. Expression Constructs and Co-transfection Assays—Clk, E1A(12S), and a E1A(12S) construct that carries a deletion of the first 72 amino acids (E1A(ΔN)) were cloned into XhoI and PmeI sites of pAc5.1/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen) for expression in Drosophila S2 cells. pHT control vector, reporter plasmids pRLcopia for Renilla luciferase control and pGL3-(4-per-E-box)hs::luc+, pGL3-per::luc+, and pGL3-tim::luc+ for expression of firefly luciferase from a minimal heat-shock promoter with four per-E-box elements, a per promoter, and a tim promoter, respectively, are described previously (13Weber F.

Expression levels of E1A constructs were determined by Western blot analysis using an anti-E1A(12S) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For dsRNA production, approximately 500-bp long DNA fragments of the coding region of target genes Clk, cyc, nej, and EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) control were generated by PCR using primers that contained a 5′ T7 RNA polymerase-binding site followed by gene specific sequences. Primers were as follows: Clk (fwd, TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGG TGG TCT GCA CCC ATA AGG; rev, TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC GTG CGT CAT CAT GGA CT); cyc (fwd, TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGT GGG TTG TGA CCG AGG AC; rev, TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA GTT GCG AAC GTT GGG C); nej (fwd, TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC AAT CTG ACG GGT CTG GTA GTG GAT; rev, TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGT GGG TTG CTG CTG TTG TTG CTG ATG); EGFP (fwd, TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGC ACA TGA AGC AGC ACG ACT T; rev, TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA CTG GGT GCT CAG GTA GTG G). Purified DNA fragments were in vitro transcribed using the T7 RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega, Madison, WI). The RNA products were isolated by using the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega) and annealed to dsRNA by incubation at 65 °C for 30 min and slow cooling to room temperature. To test effects of dsRNAs on reporter gene expression in co-transfection assays, 250 μl of Drosophila S2 cells (2 × 106 cells/ml) in serum-free Schneider's insect medium (Sigma) were incubated with 7.5 μg of dsRNA for 45 min prior to addition of 250 μl of Schneider's medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum. Cells were incubated for 24 h, and co-transfection assays were performed essentially as described previously (13Weber F. Kim H.C. Maurer C. Kay S.A. J. Neurochem. 2006; 98: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with the difference that another 7.5 μg of dsRNA was added 45 min prior to the addition of 20% fetal bovine serum. Averages of at least three independent experiments are shown as percent of control. Control is CLK·CYC-activated LUC activity in the absence of dsRNA set to 100%. Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments—FLAG-tagged CLK or CLKJrk as well as CYC and domains of NEJ were expressed from a pAc5.1 vector, which carried a SP6 promoter insertion in the KpnI site, in reticulocyte lysate using the SP6 quick-coupled transcription/translation system (Promega) as instructed by the manufacturer. NEJ domains include amino acids 1–897 (NEJ1), 898–1667 (NEJ2), 1668–2653 (NEJ3) and 2677–3190 (NEJ4). FLAG-tagged CLK or CLKJrk was expressed with unlabeled methionine to reduce background, whereas CYC and NEJ fragments were labeled with [35S]methionine. The immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (22Lee C. Kim K. Edery I. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 5316-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In brief, 10 μl of NEJ-expressing lysate was pre-incubated with 10 μl of anti-FLAG-M2-conjugated-agarose (Sigma) in 150 μl of IB solution (5 mm Tris-Cl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1× complete protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics)) to eliminate nonspecific interaction. The agarose was then removed from the lysate. The NEJ lysate was added to different interaction reactions either with or without 10 μl of CLK or CLKJrk lysate in the absence or presence of 10 μl CYC lysate (as indicated in Fig. 3), and the final volume of the interaction mixture was adjusted to 500 μl with IB solution. The protein mixture was incubated at 25 °C with gentle rotation for 30 min. Subsequently, 10 μl of anti-FLAG-M2-conjugated-agarose, previously pre-blocked in IB solution with 1% milk, was added and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C. The beads were then collected and washed three times with 500 μl of IB solution for 10 min each. Proteins were eluted with 30 μl of 2× sodium dodecyl-sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, and radiolabeled proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. We identified a circadian function of nejire (nej), which is the CBP ortholog in Drosophila, by screening of duplication mutants for phenotypes in circadian behavioral rhythms. A duplication of the X-chromosomal nej locus on the Y chromosome in Dp(1;Y)FF1 caused a large increase in the number of arrhythmic flies (Fig. 1A; Table 1). Specific overexpression of nej from a heat-shock promoter (hs-nej) resulted in a similar phenotype. Interestingly even a moderate increase in nej levels by about 45%, as observed in hs-nej flies in the absence of heat shock (Fig. 1B), was associated with a loss of behavioral rhythms in 71% of the flies (Table 1, Fig. 1A, and supplemental Fig. S1). The remaining rhythmic flies displayed a wild-type period length. This phenotype was reminiscent to the effects observed for the overexpression of Clk, which also increased the number of arrhythmic flies without affecting period length (23Kim E.Y. Kim K. Ng F.S. Glossop N.R. Hardin P.E. Edery I. Neuron. 2002; 34: 69-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). A similar increase in arrhythmicity of nej overexpressing flies was observed after entrainment in temperature cycles under subsequent free-running conditions (Table 1). This finding indicated that nej did not affect a specific entrainment pathway but the circadian clock itself. To further test specificity of the behavioral phenotype, we overexpressed nej from a UAS enhancer after transcription of a GAL4 driver from a tim promoter (tim-GAL4). Several EP lines carry an insertion of the UAS enhancer in the 5′-untranslated region of nej (24Marek K.W. Kim N. Fetter R. Smolik S. Goodman C.S. Davis G.W. Neuron. 2000; 25: 537-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). EP(X)1179 overexpressed nej by the tim-GAL4 driver, whereas two lines, EP(X)950 and EP(X)1410, carried the UAS enhancer in the inverse orientation, serving as a control that lacked nej overexpression (Fig. 1, C and D). Overexpression of nej by tim-GAL4 in EP(X)1179 resulted in an increase of behavioral arrhythmicity, without significant effects on general activity levels (Table 1). In contrast, EP(X)950 and EP(X)1410 showed wild-type rhythms. These results demonstrate that nej gain of function causes an increase in the number of behaviorally arrhythmic flies.TABLE 1Results of free-running locomotor activity measurementsGenotypeRhythmic/totalRhythmicPeriod length%±S.E.After entrainment in 12-h light/12-h dark cycles Oregon R35/428324.4 ± 0.1 w111845/469823.7 ± 0.1 Canton S – hsaLocomotor activity without (–hs) or with (+hs) application of a 37 °C heat shock for the last hour of darkness during prior entrainment in light and dark cycles120/1478223.7 ± 0.1 Canton S + hs45/587824.1 ± 0.1 hs-nejbA detailed statistical analysis indicated that within the group of arrhythmic flies, about 33% of Dp(1;Y)FF1 and 21% of hs-nej flies maintain weak behavioral rhythms (Fig. S1) – hs11/146823.9 ± 0.2 hs-nej + hs13/602224.4 ± 0.3 Dp(1;Y)FF1bA detailed statistical analysis indicated that within the group of arrhythmic flies, about 33% of Dp(1;Y)FF1 and 21% of hs-nej flies maintain weak behavioral rhythms (Fig. S1) – hs35/1113223.5 ± 0.1 Dp(1;Y)FF1 + hs3/57523.9 ± 0.4 ClkJrk – hs2/962NAcNA, not analyzed ClkJrk + hs3/585NA EP(X)95038/468324.1 ± 0.2 EP(X)950; tim-GAL4/+81/918924.9 ± 0.1 EP(X)141031/516123.4 ± 0.2 EP(X)1410; tim-GAL4/+77/948224.1 ± 0.1 EP(X)117930/437024.1 ± 0.3 EP(X)1179; tim-GAL4/+33/893724.9 ± 0.2 EP(X)114927/465927.6 ± 0.4 EP(X)1149; tim-GAL4/+16/901824.3 ± 0.2After entrainment in cycles of 12 h 18 °C and 12 h 28 °C Canton S29/397422.7 ± 0.1 hs-nej6/371623.5 ± 0.4 Dp(1;Y)FF13/32922.7 ± 0.7 ClkJrk0/370NAa Locomotor activity without (–hs) or with (+hs) application of a 37 °C heat shock for the last hour of darkness during prior entrainment in light and dark cyclesb A detailed statistical analysis indicated that within the group of arrhythmic flies, about 33% of Dp(1;Y)FF1 and 21% of hs-nej flies maintain weak behavioral rhythms (Fig. S1)c NA, not analyzed Open table in a new tab To analyze whether nej has a role in the molecular oscillator itself, we investigated the circadian profile of clock gene expression by real-time monitoring of CLK·CYC-dependent expression of a luciferase reporter from a per promoter in individual BGluc flies (25Stanewsky R. Kim M. Emery P. Beretta B. Wager-Smith K. Kay S.A. Rosbash M. Hall J.C. Cell. 1998; 95: 681-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (775) Google Scholar). After entrainment of BGluc flies in cycles of 12-h light and 12-h darkness, CLK·CYC-dependent luciferase bioluminescence was monitored for 3 days in constant darkness. Luciferase expression oscillated in BGluc control flies, whereas the antimorphic ClkJrk mutation caused molecular arrhythmicity (Fig. 2A). A moderate overexpression of nej from the heat-shock promoter at 20 °C induced arrhythmicity in 40% of hs-nej flies (Fig. 2A). Similarly, duplication of the nej locus caused molecular arrhythmicity in 64% of the flies (Fig. 2A). These results show that overexpression of nej affects the ability to maintain free running molecular rhythms, consistent with the observed increase of behaviorally arrhythmic flies. We also analyzed PER protein expression in PDF positive pacemaker lateral neurons of larval brains from EP lines that carried a tim-GAL4 driver (Fig. 2, B and C and data not shown). Although EP(X)950 and EP(X)1410 control flies displayed normal PER oscillations with trough levels at CT 10 and a peak at CT 24, the EP(X)1179 line showed a strongly reduced amplitude of PER protein oscillations. For both time points PER staining intensities in nej overexpressing EP(X)1179; tim-GAL4 flies were similar to trough PER levels in the EP(X)950; tim-GAL4 control line (supplemental Fig. S2). In summary the data show that gain of nej function is associated with a strong increase in molecular and behavioral arrhythmicity. In contrast to gain of function, a nej loss of function cannot be analyzed because of embryonic lethality. Two heterozygous nej loss of function mutants (nej3 and nejQ7) did not display a phenotype because of the remaining wild-type allele (data not shown). The lack of a period phenotype for nej partial loss of function is reminiscent to the effects of decreased CLK·CYC activity in partial Clk loss of function flies, which show a reduced amplitude but wild-type period length of circadian oscillations (26Allada R. Kim S. Nandakumar N. Rosbash M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3367-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the insertion of the UAS enhancer in the 5′-untranslated region of nej in EP(X)1149 flies has also been shown to cause a nej partial loss of function, when investigated in the absence of a GAL4 driver (24Marek K.W. Kim N. Fetter R. Smolik S. Goodman C.S. Davis G.W. Neuron. 2000; 25: 537-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We observed a severe long period phenotype in EP(X)1149 flies (Table 1). However, this phenotype did not segregate with the EP-element insertion. Sequencing revealed that this line carried an additional mutation in the per locus that substitutes serine 45 to tyrosine and has previously been coined perSLIH (27Hamblen M.J. Kim N.E. Emery P.T. Kaiser K. Hall J.C. Genetics. 1998; 149: 165-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The perSLIH mutation causes a temperature-sensitive phenotype with a long period oscillation of about 27.6 h at low temperature and a shorter period length at higher temperatures. Because nej can be overexpressed in EP(X)1149 flies by a tim-GAL4 driver (Fig. 1D), we analyzed the effects of nej overexpression on the perSLIH phenotype. In the presence of the tim-GAL4 driver, overexpression of nej in EP(X)1149 caused a strong increase in arrhythmic flies, similar to the observations in EP(X)1179 (Fig. 1A, Table 1). The remaining rhythmic flies showed, however, a wild-type period length at low temperatures demonstrating that nej overexpression suppressed the temperature-sensitive effect of the perSLIH mutation. The genetic interaction between per and nej supports an intrinsic clock function of nej as a co-activator for CLK·CYC-dependent transcription. To directly test this hypothesis we first analyzed the effects of decreased nej activity on CLK·CYC function in cell culture. CLK·CYC-dependent luciferase expression from a four per-E-box containing reporter in cell culture (21Darlington T.K. Kim K. Ceriani M.F. Staknis D. Gekakis N. Steeves T.D. Weitz C.J. Takahashi J.S. Kay S.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1599-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar) was strongly reduced by co-expression of the adenoviral E1A(12S) protein (Fig. 3A), a well characterized inhibitor of CBP/p300 (28Chawla S. Kim G.E. Quinn D.R. Bading H. Science. 1998; 281: 1505-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Specificity of NEJ/CBP inhibition was verified by co-expression of E1A(ΔN), a truncated construct that lacked the N-terminal CBP/p300 binding domain, which showed no inhibition of CLK·CYC activity. The same results were obtained using a reporter construct that expressed luciferase from a genomic fragment of the tim or per promoter (Fig. 3B and data not shown). Both E1A(12S) and E1A(ΔN) were expressed to similar levels (Fig. 3C). To confirm the specificity of reduced CLK·CYC function by inhibition of nej, we analyzed the effects of a knock-down of nej expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNA) in the co-transfection assay (Fig. 3D). siRNA targeting either Clk or cyc expression strongly reduced CLK·CYC activity as expected. In contrast, control siRNA targeting the EGFP gene had no effect on CLK·CYC function. When siRNA targeting nej transcription was included in the reporter assay, CLK·CYC activity was significantly reduced. The decrease in CLK·CYC-dependent transcription was almost proportional to the reduction in nej mRNA levels (compare Fig. 3D and supplemental Fig. S3). An almost complete inhibition of CLK·CYC activity (less than 10%) was observed after reduction of nej transcription by s"

The first of these regions, the N-terminal one, was shown to interact with E2ec (9Park Y. Wei W. Zhou L. Nemeria N. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 14037-14046Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A BLAST search and structure alignment of E1ec with transketolase suggested that a highly conserved residue His-407 of the 401-413 disordered loop (henceforth the “inner” loop) occupies space similar to that proposed for the catalytically important residue His-263 in transketolase. Guided by these modeling studies, we subsequently showed that the residue His-407 has an important role in the reductive acetylation of E2ec, i.e. in inter-component communication (10Nemeria N. Arjunan P. Brunskill A. Sheibani F. Wei W. Yan Y. Zhang S. Jordan F. Furey W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 15459-15467Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It was exciting to discover that in the crystal structure of E1ec in complex with phosphonolactyl-ThDP (PLThDP), a stable analog of LThDP in supplemental Scheme I, both the inner and the outer loop (residues 541-557) become organized (11Arjunan P.

From this latter structure many interactions between loop residues and between bound PLThDP and loop residues are seen (Fig. 1A). This study gives structural insights into the role of the His-407 residue and of the inner loop bearing it, not seen in the E1ec-ThDP complex because of disorder of the loops. A BLAST search and sequence alignment showed that residues on the inner loop are among conserved residues in E1ec and the E1 component of other bacterial 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes with octahedral symmetry (Fig. 2). On the basis of these findings, we set out to investigate potential roles (if any) of conserved loop residues, particularly their effect on loop dynamics, catalysis, and E1ec:E2ec active center communication. Site-directed mutagenesis and various spectroscopic approaches revealed that charged residues on both termini of the inner loop contribute to its stability. Whereas Asn-404 has an important role in outer loop stability (11Arjunan P. Sax M. Brunskill A. Chandrasekhar K. Nemeria N. Zhang S. Jordan F. Furey W. J. Biol.

The studies provide strong biochemical evidence regarding the role of the inner loop in covalent addition of substrate to ThDP and specificity and in sequestering the active site from solvent.

Additional purification to homogeneity, if required, was performed by applying the protein on a TSK DEAE-5PW HPLC column and eluting with a linear gradient (0.075-0.5 m) of NaCl in 20 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.5). All proteins used were >98% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and densitometry. Activity Measurements—Activities of wild type E1ec and variants was measured either by reconstitution with independently expressed E2ec and E3ec subunits (12Nemeria N. Volkov A. Brown A. Yi J. Zipper L. Guest J. Jordan F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 911-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) or with 3-lipoyl domain E2ec obtained from National BioResource Project (National Institute of Genetics, Shizuoka, Japan) (14Kitagawa M. Ara T. Arifuzzaman M. Ioka-Nakamichi T. Inamoto E. Toyonaga H. Mori H. DNA Res. 2005; 12: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar) and E3ec. The E1ec subunit-specific activity was determined by monitoring the reduction of 2,6-dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP) at 600 nm (15Nemeria N. Yan Y. Zhang Z. Brown A.M. Arjunan P. Furey W. Guest J.R. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45969-45978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Percent activities reported for variants are compared with similarly treated E1ec. All activity measurements were carried out at 30 °C. Circular Dichroism Spectroscopy—CD spectroscopy was used to determine the dissociation constants of substrate analog methyl acetyl phosphonate (MAP) (Kd(MAP)) for E1ec and loop variants. Spectra were recorded on an Aviv model 202 CD spectrometer or Chirascan CD spectrometer (Applied Photophysics) at 30 °C as described previously (15Nemeria N. Yan Y. Zhang Z. Brown A.M. Arjunan P. Furey W. Guest J.R. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45969-45978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, a 1-cm path length quartz cuvette was used for the near-UV region (250-400 nm). The instrument was calibrated using (+)-10-camphorsulfonic acid as a reference standard. ThDP was removed prior to the experiment by chromatographing E1ec and its variants on a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0). For recording CD spectra, 1.0-1.8 mg/ml of E1ec and the variants were dissolved in 10 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ThDP and titrated with variable concentrations of MAP. Data were collected at a wavelength step of 1.0 nm, an integration time of 1 s, and a bandwidth of 1 nm. Data preparation, fitting, and calculations were done using SigmaPlot (Systat Software) as described previously (15Nemeria N. Yan Y. Zhang Z. Brown A.M. Arjunan P. Furey W. Guest J.R. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45969-45978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Carboligation products were analyzed according to an NMR method described elsewhere (16Nemeria N. Tittmann K. Joseph E. Zhou L. Vazquez-Coll M. Arjunan P. Hübner G. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 21473-21482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Temperature dependence of Ka (Ka = 1/Kd(MAP)) was used to calculate thermodynamic parameters for substrate analog binding. Nonlinear fitting was done using nonlinear integrated van't Hoff equation (17Lee J.C. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 1754-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). The apparent values of the free energy ΔG, enthalpy ΔH, entropy ΔS, and the heat capacity change ΔCp of the binding reaction were calculated using Equations 7-11, respectively.lnKa=a+b(1/T)+clnT(Eq. 7) ΔG=-RTlnKa(Eq. 8) ΔH=-R(cT-b)(Eq. 9) ΔS=(ΔH-ΔG)/T(Eq. 10) ΔCp=Rc(Eq. 11) where R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. In cases where van't Hoff plots were linear, the data were fitted to Equation 12,lnKa=(-ΔH/R)(1/T)+(ΔS/R)(Eq. 12) Fluorescence Measurements—The binding affinity of ThDP to E1ec and variants was measured by quenching of the intrinsic protein fluorescence by the coenzyme as described previously (15Nemeria N. Yan Y. Zhang Z. Brown A.M. Arjunan P. Furey W. Guest J.R. Jordan F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45969-45978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Mass Spectrometric Determination of Reductive Acetylation—Reductive acetylation of independently expressed lipoyl domain by the E1ec or its variants and pyruvate was monitored by incubating the protein (0.1 or 0.5 μm) in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm ThDP, 2.0 mm pyruvate, and 0.6 mm lipoyl domain in a total volume 0.10 ml at 25 °C. Aliquots (0.5 μl) were withdrawn at different times and were mixed with 0.5 μl of α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid matrix on the target plate. Mass spectra were acquired on a 4800 Plus MALDI TOF/TOF™ Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The spectrometer was calibrated using ubiquitin (8566 Da) and lipoyl domain (8975 Da) as mass standards. Chiral Gas Chromatography—To analyze the carboligation side products and their enantiomeric excess, chiral gas chromatography (GC) was used (18Baykal A. Chakraborty S. Dodoo A. Jordan F. Bioorg. Chem. 2006; 34: 380-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The carboligation reaction was initiated by adding 8.0 mm pyruvate to 10.0 mm KH2PO4 (pH 7.0) containing 0.2 mm ThDP, 1.0 mm Mg2+, and 30.0 μm E1ec or its variants and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Acetoin from the supernatant of carboligation reaction was extracted with chloroform and injected into the Chiladex B-DM chiral column on an HP 5950 gas chromatograph (Astec, Advanced Separation Technologies, Inc.) equipped with a flame ionization detector at a flow rate of 1.2 ml/min. Analysis was carried out at 70 °C. A 20-μl aliquot of sample was injected with a 100:1 split ratio. Because this column interacts more favorably with the (S)-enantiomer thus delaying its retention time, we could readily assign the enantiomers. Acetolactate, however, could not be analyzed with this method because it would be decarboxylated under GC conditions. Crystallization and Data Collection—The apo-E401K variant of E1ec was co-crystallized separately with ThDP and PLThDP in the presence of Mg2+ by the sitting drop vapor diffusion method as described previously for E1ec (8Arjunan P. Nemeria N. Brunskill A. Chandrasekhar K. Sax M. Yan Y. Jordan F. Guest J.R. Furey W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5213-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The best crystals were obtained at a reservoir solution with 15-20% PEG2000 monomethyl ether, 10% propanol, 0.2% NaN3 in 60 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.05). Drops were 6-10 μl consisting of equal parts of reservoir and protein solution. The crystals grew within 4-6 weeks at 22 °C and were isomorphous to crystals of E1ec complexed with ThDP (8Arjunan P. Nemeria N. Brunskill A. Chandrasekhar K. Sax M. Yan Y. Jordan F. Guest J.R. Furey W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5213-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Synchrotron x-ray data sets for E401K-ThDP and E401K-PLThDP complexes were collected from single crystals flash-cooled at -180 °C at SERCAT (sector 22, ID line, Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory). All data sets were processed with the HKL2000 package (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38589) Google Scholar). The data sets were truncated at 1.85 and 1.77 Å resolution for the E401K-ThDP and E401K-PLThDP crystals, respectively. Model Building and Refinement—The previous E1ec-ThDP structure, refined to 1.85 Å resolution (8Arjunan P. Nemeria N. Brunskill A. Chandrasekhar K. Sax M. Yan Y. Jordan F. Guest J.R. Furey W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5213-5221Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), was used as the starting model for both structure determinations. The initial model included 1602 amino acids without ThDP. Both variant structures were refined using the program CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Price L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16977) Google Scholar). Refinements were carried out first keeping the entire α2 homodimer as a rigid body, and later simulated annealing was performed with a random subset of all data (∼5%) set aside for calculation of Rfree without imposing any noncrystallographic symmetry. After refinements of the protein parts were complete, 2Fo - Fc composite-simulated annealing omit maps were calculated. The maps revealed the locations of the cofactors ThDP in the E401K-ThDP complex and intermediate analogs PLThDP in the E401K-PLThDP complex. After including the ligands, the models were refined by simulated annealing. Further model building, water-molecule picking, and refinement cycles resulted in R factors of 21.8% for the E401K-ThDP complex and 23.2% for the E401K-PLThDP complex. Inspection of electron density maps, model building, and structural comparisons were carried out using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Graphical representations of protein models were generated by using the program RIBBONS (22Carson M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 958-961Crossref Scopus (783) Google Scholar). Data collection and refinement statistics are given in Table 1. Coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with the access codes 2QTA and 2QTC for the E401K-ThDP and E401K-PLThDP complexes, respectively.TABLE 1Crystallographic data and refinement statisticsApo-E401K + ThDPApo-E401K + PLThDPWavelength (Å)1.001.00Space groupP21P21Unit cella81.81 Å81.61 Åb141.83 Å142.11 Åc82.56 Å82.14 Åβ102.01°102.68°Resolution1.85 Å1.77 ÅCompleteness % (last shell)97.1 (91.5)90.6 (76.4)Total reflections151,931160,246Rmerge0.0750.100Refinement statisticsResolution range50-1.85 Å50-1.77 ÅR-factor (last shell)0.218 (0.255)0.232 (0.308)Rfree (last shell)0.242 (0.281)0.264 (0.339)No. of residues16021602No. of waters413394Average B factor (Å)Main chain18.6120.65Side chain18.9020.88Solvent atoms18.7021.34Root mean square deviationsBond lengths0.010 Å0.010 ÅBond angles1.5°1.6° Open table in a new tab Substitutions of Inner Loop Residues Affect Activities to Varying Degrees—Substitution of the amino acids of the inner loop to alanine did not alter the overall activity of the complex significantly, with the exception of His-407 discussed earlier (10Nemeria N.

Substitution with charge-reversed residues, however, led to appreciable reduction in overall activity, especially toward the N-terminal end of the loop. The E1-specific (DCPIP) activities followed a similar trend; charge reversal reduced the activity more than alanine substitution and especially toward lower numbered amino acids. The reduction in E1-specific activity is always smaller than in the overall activity for all variants. A similar change in activity was observed in H407A and H407C (on the cysteineless variants of E1ec; data not shown). Although His-407 and Gln-408 form hydrogen bonds with PLThDP (the latter indirectly through water), and both of them are also in the active site cleft (11Arjunan P. Sax M. Brunskill A.

Chem. 2006; 281: 15296-15303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the Q408A substitution has very little effect on overall activity and none on DCPIP activity. The kcat values followed the same trend as the specific activity, decreasing by as much as 177-fold in charge reversal variants.TABLE 2Activity and binding kinetics of substrate pyruvate and coenzyme ThDP for 401-413 loop variantsSubstitutionActivityaOverall activity determined by reconstituting with 3-lipoyl domain E2ec (3-lipE2ec) as opposed to 1-lipE2ec used with all other variants.

Open table in a new tab Km and Kd Values for ThDP and Pyruvate Binding—The Km(ThDP) values (Table 2) were not very different from that for E1ec except for some charge-reversed variants. The latter could not be analyzed by this method because of their low activity. Binding of ThDP according to fluorescence quenching experiments yielded similar Kd(ThDP) values for E1ec and all inner loop variants. However, curve fitting to a Hill equation resulted in a Hill coefficient (nH) >2 for K410A (nH = 2.08), K411A (nH = 2.39) and K410E (nH = 2.16), K411E (nH = 2.68) variants (compared with nH = 1.06 for E1ec) indicating that these substitutions induced strong positive cooperativity for ThDP binding. The Km(pyruvate) increased slightly in the E401A and K403A variants, but kcat/Km(pyruvate) decreased significantly (∼23- and 25-fold). This indicates that steps from substrate binding through decarboxylation (supplemental Scheme I) are impaired. Because charge reversal of these residues yielded very low activity, they could not be treated in a similar fashion. Covalent Addition of Substrate to ThDP Is Greatly Impaired in the Loop Variants—All the loop variants when titrated with substrate analog MAP to check the formation of PLThDP (a stable analog of pre-decarboxylation intermediate LThDP (supplemental Scheme II)) gave a CD band with λmax ∼300-305 nm, assigned to the 1′,4′-imino tautomer of PLThDP (16Nemeria N. Tittmann K. Joseph E. Zhou L. Vazquez-Coll M. Arjunan P. Hübner G. Furey W. Jordan F. J. Biol.

Given sufficient time for full development of the signal at each point in the titration, the amplitude of the CD signal will be directly proportional to the concentration of substrate analog, enabling us to obtain the apparent dissociation constant for MAP (Kd(MAP)). The Kd(MAP) consists of two dissociation constants (supplemental Scheme II), the first for forming a Michaelis-type noncovalent complex (K2,MM) and the second for reversible formation of the covalent PLThDP (or LThDP) intermediate (K2,covalent).

This interaction requires an intact C terminus of Kv4.2 and occurs via the PDZ domains of SAP97. Pharmacologically induced translocation of SAP97 to spines also drives Kv4.2 to the PSD, whereas SAP97 lentivirally based RNA interference reduces Kv4.2 in the PSD.

These results show that SAP97-CaMKII pathway plays an important role for the trafficking of Kv4.2 to dendrites and spines. The efficient transmission and processing of information in neurons depend on the precise subcellular localization and distribution of ion channels in different compartments and at sites of synaptic communication (1Sheng M. Wyszynski M. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Lai H.C. Jan L.Y. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 548-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Dendrites and spines are the primary sites of synaptic input and express several ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels. Among those are the transient, fast-inactivating A-type channels. The density of A-type channels increases at least 5-fold from the soma to about 350 μmin dendrites (3Hoffman D.A. Magee J.C. Colbert C.M. Johnston D. Nature. 1997; 387: 869-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and appears to be high in the oblique dendrites as well. The A-type current plays an important role in regulating dendritic excitability by reducing the amplitude of excitatory postsynaptic potentials and back propagating action potential and by regulating the induction and expression of long term potentiation. These A-type channels are also modulated by a variety of neurotransmitters such as norepinehrine, acetylcholine, and dopamine (4Birnbaum S.G. Varga A.W. Yuan L.L. Anderson A.E. Sweatt J.D.

Pharmacological and molecular biological studies have implicated Kv4.2 as a key subunit of the A-type channel (5Jerng H.H. Pfaffinger P.J. Covarrubias M. Mol. Cell.

Despite this observation, very little is known about how K+ channels, and in particular A-type channels, are targeted and expressed in dendrites and spines. In heterologous expression systems, K+ channels have been shown to interact with members of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) family. In particular, interaction with PSD-95 has been shown to facilitate surface expression and clustering of the K+ channels (7Wong W. Newell E.W. Jugloff D.G. Jones O.T. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol.

SAP97 and PSD-95 have been shown to exhibit distinct mechanisms for regulating the surface expression and clustering of Kv1-type channels. SAP97 is also of importance for the surface expression of Kv1.5 (10Folco E.J. Liu G.X. Koren G. Am. J.

In particular, we have previously shown that CaMKII can in vivo phosphorylate SAP97 into two different residues, Ser-39 and Ser-232. These two residues are located in crucial domains responsible for regulating SAP97 protein trafficking as well as binding of SAP97 to interacting proteins (15Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C.

Here, we have investigated the molecular details of Kv4.2 interaction with MAGUK proteins in organotypic slice cultures of the hippocampus and the role of this interaction for the subcellular localization of Kv4.2 in hippocampal neurons. In addition, we have found evidence for the SAP97-CaMKII pathway in regulating the subcellular localization of Kv4.2. DNA Constructs—The enhanced green fluorescent protein Kv4.2 fusion (EGFP Kv4.2) has been described previously (16Kunjilwar K. Strang C. DeRubeis D. Pfaffinger P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54542-54551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A truncation mutant of Kv4.2 lacking the entire C terminus was constructed by introducing a stop codon at position 409 of Kv4.2. The EGFP Kv4.2 fusion construct and the EGFP Kv4.2 truncation mutant lacking the C terminus were subcloned into the pSinRep5 (17; Invitrogen). Both EGFP fusion constructs were expressed at similar expression levels (data not shown). The Kv4.2 IRES constitutively active calmodulin-dependent kinase II α (IRES tCaMKII) was generated by transferring the IRES tCaMKII construct kindly provided by Y. Hayashi (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) into EGFP Kv4.2 in pSinRep 5. The integrity of these constructs was verified by automatic sequencing. Antibodies—The monoclonal antibody to Kv4.2 (K57/1) was purchased from Neuromab and has been described previously (18Rhodes K.J. Carroll K.I. Sung M.A. Doliveira L.C. Monaghan M.M. Burke S.L.

The monoclonal antibody was developed by and/or obtained from the University of California, Davis, NINDS/NIMH NeuroMab Facility. Monoclonal antibody to synaptophysin was purchased from Roche Applied Science; mouse αCaMKII antibody was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA); polyclonal SAP97 antibody, polyclonal SAP102 antibody, and monoclonal PSD-95 antibody were purchased from Affinity BioReagents Inc. (Golden, CO); monoclonal SAP97 antibody was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada); polyclonal anti-GFP and AlexaFluor 488, 555, 568, and 633 secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Neuronal Culture and Transfection—Hippocampal neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day 18 to 19 rat hippocampi as described previously, with minor modifications (19Sala C. Piech V. Wilson N.R. Passafaro M. Liu G. Sheng M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 115-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Neurons were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method at 7 days in vitro (DIV). Organotypic Slice Cultures and Sindbis Virus Infections—Organotypic slice cultures were prepared from postnatal day 7 (P7) animals and cultured on Millicell inserts (Millipore) as described previously in detail (17Jeromin A. Yuan L.L. Frick A. Pfaffinger P. Johnston D. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Typically, slice cultures were infected after 5-7 DIV. Sindbis pseudovirions were prepared using a modified less cytotoxic variant. The cDNAs were subcloned into a modified form of pSinRep5 and packaged using the DHBB helper. Psesudovirions were harvested typically after 72 h and used to focally infect the slice cultures as described previously (17Jeromin A. Yuan L.L. Frick A. Pfaffinger P. Johnston D. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Lentiviral RNA Interference of SAP97—For the siRNA expressing lentivirus vector, an RNAi stem-loop (12Nakagawa T. Futai K. Lashuel H.A. Lo I. Okamoto K. Walz T. Hayashi Y. Sheng M. Neuron. 2004; 44: 453-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) has been cloned in the lentivirus-based vector pLL3.7 (20; Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Cancer Research, Cambridge), and an empty pLL3.7 vector has been used to generate the control lentivirus vectors. The lentiviral infecting particles were prepared as described previously (21Lois C. Hong E.J. Pease S. Brown E.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 295: 868-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). Neurons were infected with SAP97i-lentivirus or control virus at DIV6, and TIF preparation was performed at DIV10. Subcellular Fractionation—TIF were isolated from neurons harvested at 10-14 DIV or hippocampal slices as described previously (15Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PSDs from rat hippocampus were purified as described previously (22Gardoni F. Caputi A. Cimino M. Pastorino L. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1733-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). COS-7 Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells at 20-50% confluence (24 h after plating on glass coverslips in 12-well plates) were transfected by Superfect® transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with cDNA expression constructs (1-1.5 μg of DNA/well) for 3 h at 5% CO2, 37 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, fed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and grown for 24-48 h before fixation for immunocytochemistry or before metabolic labeling experiments. Mutated products were obtained by using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Immunofluorescence Labeling, Image Acquisition, Quantification, and Statistical Analysis—Hippocampal neurons were fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C for 15 min. Primary and secondary antibodies were applied in GDB buffer (30 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.2% gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 0.8 m NaCl). Confocal images were obtained using a Nikon ×60 objective with sequential acquisition setting at 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution. Each image was a z series projection of ∼8-12 images taken at 0.5-1-μm depth intervals. Transfected COS-7 cells, transfected neurons, and pharmacologically treated neurons were chosen randomly for quantification from two to five coverslips from three to five independent experiments. Quantification of confocal experiments was performed using Laserpix software (Bio-Rad). Image acquisition, quantification of the fluorescence signal, and co-localization analysis were performed by investigators who were ‘blind’ to the experimental condition. Quantification of Western blot analysis was performed by means of computer-assisted imaging (Quantity-One® System; Bio-Rad), and statistical evaluations were performed according to one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni as post hoc comparison test; if the experiment includes only two experimental conditions, paired Student's t test was used. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. and, if not indicated otherwise, as percentage of control derived from three to six independent experiments. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of GST Fusion Protein—SAP97 fragments were subcloned downstream of glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the BamHI and HindIII sites of the expression plasmid pGEX-KG by PCR using plaque-forming unit polymerase (Promega). The inserts were fully sequenced with the ABI Prism 310 genetic analyzer (ABI Prisma). SAP97-GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma), and eluted as described previously (23Gardoni F. Schrama L.H. van Dalen J.J. Gispen W.H. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 394-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Pulldown Assay—Aliquots of PSD containing 10 μg of proteins were diluted with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% SDS to a final volume of 200 μl and incubated (1 h, 37 °C) with glutathione-agarose beads saturated with GST fusion proteins or GST alone. The beads were extensively washed with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100. Bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis with a monoclonal Kv4.2 antibody. SAP97 Co-localization and Interaction with Kv4.2 from Rat Hippocampus—We first examined the relative abundance of voltage-gated potassium channel Kv4.2 in rat hippocampal subcellular compartments by means of a biochemical fractionation method, as described previously (15Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Postsynaptic densities (PSD) were purified from rat hippocampus, and the expression of Kv4.2 as well as of pre- and postsynaptic markers was investigated in various subcellular compartments through Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig. 1a, Kv4.2 channel was enriched in the PSD fraction and in the Triton-insoluble “PSD-enriched” fraction (TIF). Kv4.2 was present with a similar distribution in the total homogenate and in the crude membrane fraction (P2) and at a low level in the synaptosomal membrane and in the low speed supernatant (S1) fractions. In the same samples, we examined the subcellular distribution of synaptophysin (presynaptic marker), αCaMKII, PSD-95, SAP102, and SAP97. As expected, synaptophysin was present in all subcellular compartments analyzed but not in the PSD and in the TIF-purified fractions, whereas PSD-95 and αCaMKII have a similar distribution pattern being enriched in synaptosomes and PSD fractions (Fig. 1a). The partition pattern of Kv4.2 channel was similar to that of SAP97 and SAP102. Previous works described the presence of a specific binding between Kv4.2 and PSD-95 (7Wong W. Newell E.W. Jugloff D.G. Jones O.T. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20423-20430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Wong W. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 444-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Because we found a comparable subcellular localization of Kv4.2 with both SAP97 and SAP102, we investigated whether Kv4.2 forms complexes with different members of the MAGUK protein family. First of all, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed from homogenate of rat hippocampus (Fig. 1b). As shown in Fig. 1b (top panel), homogenates were incubated with antibodies directed against PSD-95, SAP97, and SAP102, and the precipitates were probed with the Kv4.2 antibody. Anti-SAP97 and anti-PSD-95, but not anti-SAP102, co-immunoprecipitated Kv4.2 (Fig. 1b, top panel); the absence of any Kv4.2 signal in the No Ab lane tends to exclude that in our experimental conditions, and the co-precipitation of Kv4.2 reflects an unspecific immunoprecipitation of insoluble proteins. Accordingly, anti-Kv4.2 was able to co-precipitate SAP97 and PSD-95 but not SAP102 (Fig. 1b, bottom panel). Furthermore, we performed Kv4.2-MAGUK co-immunoprecipitation experiments from different subcellular fractions, i.e. synaptosomes and PSD to evaluate the capability of SAP97 and PSD-95 to bind Kv4.2 in specific subcellular compartments. Fig. 1c (top panel) shows that, in all tested compartments, Kv4.2 co-precipitates with SAP97 suggesting the subsistence of the binding between the proteins also at synaptic sites. On the other hand, the PSD-95-Kv4.2 interaction was more pronounced in the PSD fraction (Fig. 1c, bottom panel). It is known that PSD-95 binding to Kv4.2 requires the VSAL motif at the C-terminal domain of the channel indicating a PDZ-mediated interaction (7Wong W. Newell E.W. Jugloff D.G. Jones O.T. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20423-20430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Wong W. Schlichter L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 444-452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). To determine which SAP97 domain is involved in the association to Kv4.2, fusion proteins of GST with SAP97-N terminal domain-(7-223), SAP97-PDZ1-(217-318), SAP97-PDZ3-(465-545), and SAP97-SH3-(580-650) were prepared and incubated with aliquots of PSD purified from rat hippocampi for a pulldown assay. Only GST-SAP97-PDZ1 and GST-SAP97-PDZ3 were able to pull down Kv4.2, and neither GST alone nor other SAP97 domains tested showed positive results (Fig. 1d). Interaction between SAP97 and Kv4.2 in Virally Infected Organotypic Slices—To further confirm an interaction of Kv4.2/SAP97 in neurons and to confirm in neurons the identity of Kv4.2 and SAP97 domains needed for the interaction, we used organotypic slices virally infected with SAP97 and Kv4.2 constructs. Slices were infected with a modified Sindbis virus expressing EGFP-SAP97 or EGFP-PSD-95 constructs (17Jeromin A. Yuan L.L. Frick A. Pfaffinger P. Johnston D. J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 2741-2750Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed from infected slice homogenates by means of an EGFP antibody. Fig. 2a (left panel) shows that both infected SAP97 and PSD-95 are able to bind endogenous Kv4.2. No immunostaining for Kv4.2 was detected when the precipitating EGFP antibody was omitted. In addition, experiments performed by transfecting slices with an EGFP-SAP97-ΔPDZ construct lacking the three PDZ domains of SAP97 (Fig. 2a, right panel) confirmed the specificity of the co-precipitation assay as well as the existence of a PDZ-mediated interaction between SAP97 and Kv4.2 as already suggested by the pulldown assay (see Fig. 1d). To further strengthen this point, viral transfection of organotypic slices and subsequent co-precipitation experiments were repeated by using EGFP-Kv4.2 constructs. Under these experimental conditions, the EGFP antibody was able to co-precipitate endogenous SAP97 (Fig. 2b) from EGFP-Kv4.2 transfected slice homogenates; no bands corresponding to SAP97 were found in the EGFP lane indicating the absence of any interaction between the exogenously added EGFP tag and endogenous SAP97 present in organotypic slice culture. Viral infection of the EGFP-Kv4.2-construct lacking the Kv4.2 C terminus, including VSAL PDZ-binding domain, did not produce any immunostaining for SAP97 in the co-immunoprecipitated material; these data confirm the requirement of the PDZ-mediated interaction to detect Kv4.2 binding to SAP97. Recent studies have shown that Kv4.2 as well as SAP97 are substrates for CaMKII in hippocampal neurons (6Varga A.W. Yuan L.L. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Wu G.Y. Gatchel J.R. Johnston D. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3643-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar); to check whether CaMKII phosphorylation could affect Kv4.2-SAP97 protein-protein interaction, active αCaMKII (1-290 truncation) was co-transfected with SAP97 and Kv4.2 (Fig. 2c). The co-precipitation assay showed the presence of Kv4.2-SAP97 co-precipitation also in presence of the active form of the kinase (Fig. 2c), suggesting that the constitutively active CaMKII does not qualitatively alter the interaction between Kv4.2 and SAP97. SAP97-mediated Trafficking of Kv4.2 in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons—To address the role of SAP97 in modulating Kv4.2 localization to the postsynaptic compartment, we infected primary hippocampal cultures with SAP97 RNAi expressing lentivirus. Nearly 100% of neurons in culture can be infected with lentivirus with minimal cytotoxicity (data not shown); the effect of SAP97 RNAi could therefore be quantified through a biochemical approach across the entire population of neurons in culture. TIF was obtained from control and SAP97 RNAi neurons (15Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Mauceri D. Gardoni F. Marcello E. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1032-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and protein levels were measured in the homogenate and TIF. The same amount of proteins from homogenate and TIF was loaded on the SDS-PAGE for Western blot analysis. Compared with empty virus infection at the same viral titer, lentivirus expressing SAP97 RNAi caused pro-found and specific knockdown of SAP97 as shown by immunoblotting of total homogenate of hippocampal cultures (Fig. 3a). As shown in Fig. 3a, siRNA knockdown of SAP97 leads a significant reduction in Kv4.2 localization in the postsynaptic compartment (p < 0.05, -30.0 ± 7.4% SAP97 RNAi versus control) suggesting a specific role for SAP97 in the correct Kv4.2 localization at synaptic sites. No alterations of SAP102 or αCaMKII levels were observed in total lysates as well as in TIF fractions, confirming the specificity of SAP97 RNAi knockdown (Fig. 3a). Recent observations indicate that activation of ryanodine receptors in the hippocampus, through caffeine treatment, can play a role in synaptic plasticity events by means of elevation of CaMKII activity (14Mauceri D. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Gardoni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23813-23821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), addressing CaMKII as a potential enzymatic target of the calcium-induced calcium release from ER ryanodine stores. Interestingly, calcium-induced calcium release from ryanodine receptors, as induced by caffeine treatment, has been shown necessary to trigger CaMKII-dependent SAP97 trafficking (14Mauceri D. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Gardoni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23813-23821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 24Mauceri D. Gardoni F. Marcello E. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1032-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we tested whether caffeine treatment (10 mm, 15 min) was sufficient to induce not only SAP97 but also Kv4.2 trafficking from the ER. These experiments were performed in the presence of d-2-amino-5-phosphopentanoic acid (APV) to block NMDA receptors as a source of extracellular calcium. As shown in Fig. 3b, caffeine treatment significantly increased Kv4.2 immunostaining in TIF without affecting the total Kv4.2 protein level in the homogenate (*, p < 0.01; +60.2 ± 13.1%, caffeine versus control expressed as Kv4.2 ratio TIF/homogenate). As expected, treatment of hippocampal cultures with caffeine also leads to a higher staining of SAP97 in TIF (*, p < 0.01; +51.1 ± 8.3%, caffeine versus control expressed as SAP97 ratio TIF/homogenate) confirming previous observations (14Mauceri D. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Gardoni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23813-23821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). On the other hand, no significant effect of caffeine treatment on αCaMKII, SAP102 and PSD-95 localization in the TIF was found (Fig. 3b). We have very recently described that treatment of hippocampal neurons with ryanodine (100 μm), to block calcium-induced calcium release from intracellular ER stores, and with a brief pulse of NMDA (50 μm), to promote a raise in calcium levels into the postsynaptic compartment, does not influence SAP97-Ser-39 phosphorylation and consequently does not modify SAP97 subcellular distribution (24Mauceri D. Gardoni F. Marcello E. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1032-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Based on these data, we treated primary hippocampal neurons with NMDA + ryanodine to check whether not only SAP97 but also Kv4.2 localization was unaffected by this experimental treatment. As shown in Fig. 3c, no significant effect of both SAP97 (p < 0.05; -3.7 ± 9.3%, NMDA + ryanodine versus control expressed as SAP97 ratio TIF/homogenate) and Kv4.2 (p > 0.05; -9, 1 ± 13.2%, NMDA + ryanodine versus control expressed as Kv4.2 ratio TIF/homogenate) localization in the TIF was induced by NMDA + ryanodine treatment. To further study the role of SAP97-CaMKII pathway on subcellular localization of native Kv4.2 in neurons, we analyzed by confocal microscopy the effect of caffeine treatment on the endogenous distribution of Kv4.2 in primary hippocampal cultures. It has been shown that Kv4.2 channels in neurons are primarily localized in cell soma and dendrites (4Birnbaum S.G. Varga A.W. Yuan L.L. Anderson A.E. Sweatt J.D. Schrader L.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 803-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 25Maletic-Savatic M. Lenn N.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3840-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sheng M. Tsaur M.L.

As shown in Fig. 3d (left panel), endogenous Kv4.2 displayed an intense labeling in the cell soma; immunoreactivity was also detectable in dendrites where a diffuse staining was present. Interestingly, caffeine (Fig. 3d, right panel) was able to affect Kv4.2 immunostaining leading to a higher signal in the dendritic shafts paralleled to a decreased immunofluorescence in the cell soma. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed to check the possible modulation of the MAGUK-Kv4.2 interaction by caffeine. A significant increase of SAP97-Kv4.2 co-precipitation was found (Fig. 3e) both in homogenate (*, p < 0.05; +30.2 ± 6.9%, caffeine versus control) and TIF (*, p < 0.01; +76.1 ± 10.5%, caffeine versus control) confirming the hypothesis of a Kv4.2 SAP97-mediated trafficking induced by caffeine (Fig. 3e). PSD-95-Kv4.2 complex was detected in the TIF only after caffeine treatment, confirming the increased localization of Kv4.2 in the postsynaptic compartment. No PSD-95-Kv4.2 interaction was found in the homogenate under these experimental conditions (Fig. 3e). No interaction of SAP102 to Kv4.2 was found confirming the specificity of the binding of SAP97 and PSD-95 to the channel (Fig. 3e). CaMKII-dependent Phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-39 Affects Kv4.2 Trafficking—A co-localization assay in COS-7 cells was used to study interactions of wild type and mutated forms of SAP97 and Kv4.2 in intact cells and to check whether CaMKII phosphorylation of SAP97 and Kv4.2 phospho-sites could affect Kv4.2-SAP97 protein-protein interaction. In single transfections, both Kv4.2wt (Fig. 4a) and SAP97wt (Fig. 4b) showed a characteristic perinuclear accumulation as reported previously (15Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 28Tiffany A.M. Manganas L.N. Kim E. Hsueh Y.P. Sheng M. Trimmer J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 147-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Co-transfection of SAP97wt and Kv4.2wt (Fig. 4, f-h) displayed a high co-localization value between the two proteins (87.1 ± 6.3%) confirming an elevated affinity of Kv4.2 channel for SAP97, as described above. Recent data showed that CaMKII-dependent SAP97 Ser-39 phosphorylation, induced by caffeine treatment, regulates the subcellular localization of SAP97, providing a fine molecular mechanism responsible for the synaptic delivery of SAP97 itself as well as SAP97-interacting proteins (14Mauceri D. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Gardoni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23813-23821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we co-transfected in COS-7 cells Kv4.2wt with SAP97(S39D) mutation construct mimicking CaMKII-dependent SAP97 Ser-39 phosphorylation (Fig. 4, c-e). Co-expression of Kv4.2wt with SAP97(S39D) caused a redistribution of Kv4.2 channel staining throughout the cell with a concomitant reduction of the strong fluorescence around the nucleus. Thus, SAP97 mutant mimicking the CaMKII phospho-site appears to facilitate release of the Kv4.2 channel from the internal compartments and recruitment toward the cell surface, without affecting SAP97 clustering with Kv4.2. Conversely, co-transfection of Kv4.2 with SAP97 (S39A) showed a more pronounced perinuclear accumulation of the two proteins (Fig. 4, i-k). No effect on Kv4.2 distribution was observed by mutation into aspartate of the two Kv4.2 CaMKII-dependent phospho-sites (6Varga A.W. Yuan L.L. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Wu G.Y. Gatchel J.R. Johnston D. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3643-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) both in Kv4.2 single transfections (data not shown) and in co-transfection with SAP97wt (Fig. 4, l-n). No significant effect on the degree of co-localization between the two transfected proteins was produced by any mutation constructs used, confirming the idea that CaMKII phosphorylation of Kv4.2 or SAP97 does not affect the co-localization between the two proteins. To confirm the results obtained in transfected COS-7 cells and to address the role of SAP97 Ser-39 phosphorylation in modulating Kv4.2 localization in neurons, we transfected primary hippocampal cultures with GFP-SAP97wt, GFP-SAP97-S39D, or GFP-SAP97-S39A constructs (Fig. 5, a-d) (14Mauceri D.

Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SAP97 staining overlapped Kv4.2 distribution in cultured hippocampal neurons (Fig. 5b); co-localization analysis revealed a high co-localization pattern between the two proteins (76.0 ± 9.2%). Analysis of endogenous Kv4.2 staining in neurons transfected with GFP-SAP97wt revealed no major differences compared with untransfected cells (data not shown; for quantification see Fig. 5d) in agreement with previous observations in COS-7 cells (see Fig. 4, f-h) indicating a high co-localization between the two wild-type proteins without any specific effect on Kv4.2 distribution. On the other hand, hippocampal neurons transfected with GFP-SAP97 S39D showed an increased staining of Kv4.2 in “spine-like” structures where the Kv4.2 channel co-localizes precisely with the S39D mutant form of SAP97 (14Mauceri D. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Gardoni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23813-23821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5c). In addition, quantification of the dendritic shaft versus somatic signal of Kv4.2, measured by the relative fluorescence intensity within these structures, revealed that GFP-SAP97 S39D transfected neurons displays an increased Kv4.2 fluorescent signal in dendritic structures (Fig. 5, c and d, p < 0.005, GFP-SAP97 S39D versus untransfected). Conversely, transfection of GFP-SAP97 S39A (Fig. 5a) resulted in a redistribution of Kv4.2 signal toward the cell soma with a decreased dendritic staining (Fig. 5d **, p < 0.001, GFP-SAP97 S39A versus untransfected) suggesting that CaMKII phosphorylation of SAP97-Ser-39 phospho-site can be necessary for synaptic trafficking of SAP97 interacting proteins, such as Kv4.2. The somatodendritic A-type potassium current, ISA, is particularly important for regulating action potential back propagation as well as the local excitability of the dendrite. Modulations in the expression and functional properties of the ISA current have been observed during long term potentiation and epilepsy, and increasing evidence suggests that abnormal regulation of these channels may be acquired during epilepsy (4Birnbaum S.G. Varga A.W. Yuan L.L. Anderson A.E. Sweatt J.D. Schrader L.A. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 803-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), leading to an increased excitability of the pyramidal neuron dendrite that contributes to the initiation and prolongation of seizures. It is thereby of importance to understand the regulatory mechanism underlying the trafficking of key constituents of ISA, such as Kv4.2, into dendrites and spines. Here we show that Kv4.2 is enriched in rodent purified PSDs by means of SAP97-mediated trafficking from the ER. Indeed, we have observed that Kv4.2 interacts with SAP97 and PSD-95, although in different cell compartments suggesting the binding with SAP97 as being instrumental for SAP97 trafficking to and with PSD-95 for localization in the postsynaptic compartment. Based on co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the interaction of Kv4.2 with SAP97 appears to require an intact C terminus of Kv4.2. In GST pulldown assays, we have identified the PDZ domains of SAP97 as being a key constituent for the binding to Kv4.2. We have previously shown that CaMKII phosphorylates SAP97 and causes an enrichment of SAP97 in the postsynaptic compartment (14Mauceri D. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Gardoni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23813-23821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 15Gardoni F. Mauceri D. Fiorentini C. Bellone C. Missale C. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44745-44752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that CaMKII phosphorylation of Kv4.2 increases the surface expression of Kv4.2 in fibroblasts or cultured hippocampal neurons without altering its biophysical properties (6Varga A.W. Yuan L.L. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Wu G.Y. Gatchel J.R. Johnston D. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3643-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Interestingly, here we show that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Kv4.2 in the two previously identified sites (6Varga A.W. Yuan L.L. Anderson A.E. Schrader L.A. Wu G.Y. Gatchel J.R. Johnston D. Sweatt J.D. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3643-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) does not affect Kv4.2 interaction with SAP97 as well as Kv4.2 distribution in transfected cells. Interestingly, knockdown of SAP97 significantly reduces the localization of Kv4.2 in the Triton-insoluble postsynaptic compartment addressing a specific role of SAP97 in driving Kv4.2 to synaptic sites. Using site-specific mutants of SAP97 mimicking either its phosphorylation in Ser-39 by CaMKII or abolishing it, we show that the SAP97 Ser-39 phosphorylation increased the presence of endogenous Kv4.2 in dendrites compared with wild type, whereas the mutant with abolished phosphorylation site decreased it. In addition, we dissected the intracellular biochemical pathways governing trafficking of endogenous Kv4.2 from the ER. In particular, treating neurons with caffeine, a pharmacological tool capable of activating ER-associated CaMKII and consequently driving the exit of SAP97 from the ER (14Mauceri D. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Gardoni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23813-23821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we saw an increase in the staining of Kv4.2 in dendrites, as well as its level in a TIF fraction, resembling the composition of the postsynaptic density. On the other hand, a pharmacological strategy blocking Ca2+ efflux from the ER and promoting activation of CaMKII in the spine (24Mauceri D. Gardoni F. Marcello E. Di Luca M. J. Neurochem. 2007; 100: 1032-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) is not capable of inserting new Kv4.2 subunits in the TIF fraction. With this view, we here confirm and expand the observation that CaMKII activation results in a direct regulation of SAP97 function; indeed, we show here that CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of SAP97 at Ser-39 affects trafficking and distribution of SAP97-interacting proteins, i.e. Kv4.2, thus strengthening the hypothesis that phosphorylation of SAP97 entails redistribution of SAP97 complexes from the ER to synaptic compartments. In agreement with these data, Nakagawa et al. (12Nakagawa T. Futai K. Lashuel H.A. Lo I. Okamoto K. Walz T. Hayashi Y. Sheng M. Neuron. 2004; 44: 453-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) recently reported that SAP97 S39A mutant shifts SAP97 balance toward multimerization and, consequently, toward a static localization. In addition, our study confirms previous data showing that SAP97 phosphorylation by CaMKII is a key step in the complex and finely tuned mechanism governing delivery of SAP97-interacting proteins, i.e. GluR1 (14Mauceri D. Cattabeni F. Di Luca M. Gardoni F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23813-23821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), to the postsynaptic complex. Schluter et al. (29Schluter O.M. Xu W. Malenka R.C. Neuron. 2006; 51: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) recently identified a two isoforms of SAP97 and PSD-95. Although the α isoforms promote AMPA receptor insertion in an activity-independent manner, the β isoforms influence AMPA receptor-dependent synaptic strength in a CaMKII-dependent manner. Interestingly, the effect of the β isoform of SAP97 was dependent of the knockdown of endogenous PSD-95. Future studies will have to address a possible differential role of the two isoforms of PSD-95 and SAP97 in combination with acute knockdown and rescue experiments. It will also be interesting to determine how the induction of synaptic plasticity influences the distribution of Kv4.2 to synapses. Expression of PSD-95 did not change the localization of Kv4.2 in dendrites or spines in cultured neurons (data not shown). A previous report had suggested clustering of Kv4.2 in transfected fibroblasts by co-expressed PSD-95, but we did not notice any apparent differences in the localization of endogenous Kv4.2 upon expression of PSD-95 in transfected neurons. Our co-immunoprecipitation experiments clearly suggest the presence of a PSD-95-Kv4.2 complex only at synaptic sites, suggesting that SAP97 is a key protein responsible for Kv4.2 trafficking, whereas PSD-95 represents an important anchoring element for Kv4.2 once the protein has been delivered at membrane/synaptic compartment. Finally, our study has clarified the molecular details of Kv4.2 interaction with MAGUK proteins in hippocampal neurons addressing a key role of CaMKII in the regulation of SAP97-mediated localization of Kv4.2 at synaptic sites. The monoclonal antibody to Kv4.2, was developed by and/or obtained from the University of California, Davis, NINDS/NIMH NeuroMab Facility, supported by National Institutes of Health Grant U24NS050606 and maintained by the Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis."

Cbl proteins bind to phosphotyrosine residues on activated RTKs to affect ligand-dependent ubiquitylation of these receptors targeting them for degradation in the lysosome. Both c-Cbl and Cbl-b contain a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, which is important for Cbl dimerization and tyrosine phosphorylation; however, the mechanism of UBA-mediated dimerization and its requirement for Cbl biological activity is unclear. Here, we report the crystal structure of the UBA domain of c-Cbl refined to 2.1-Å resolution. The structure reveals the protein is a symmetric dimer tightly packed along a large hydrophobic surface formed by helices 2 and 3. NMR chemical shift mapping reveals heterodimerization can occur with the related Cbl-b UBA domain via the same surface employed for homodimerization. Disruption of c-Cbl dimerization by site-directed mutagenesis impairs c-Cbl phosphorylation following activation of the Met/hepatocyte growth factor RTK and c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of Met. This provides direct evidence for a role of Cbl dimerization in terminating signaling following activation of RTKs.

This provides direct evidence for a role of Cbl dimerization in terminating signaling following activation of RTKs. Cbl proteins are a small class of E3 ubiquitin ligases represented by three mammalian members: c-Cbl, Cbl-b, and Cbl-3. Unlike Cbl-3, the c-Cbl and Cbl-b genes are ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels of expression in hematopoietic tissues. c-Cbl and Cbl-b are important regulators of many receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTKs), 5The abbreviations used are:RTKreceptor-tyrosine kinaseUBAubiquitin-associatedHGFhepatocyte growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorFKBPFK506-binding proteinHAhemagglutininHEKhuman embryonic kidney 5The abbreviations used are:RTKreceptor-tyrosine kinaseUBAubiquitin-associatedHGFhepatocyte growth factorEGFepidermal growth factorFKBPFK506-binding proteinHAhemagglutininHEKhuman embryonic kidney including the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor Met. Cbl proteins are recruited to many activated RTKs and promote their ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation (1Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The domain architecture for the Cbl family contains a highly conserved NH2-terminal half that includes a tyrosine kinase-binding domain and a RING finger domain, which recruits the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and is required for Cbl-mediated down-regulation of RTKs. The COOH-terminal half of Cbl proteins is more variable. c-Cbl and Cbl-b contain multiple protein interaction domains in addition to a COOH-terminal ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain (1Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Biochem. J. 2005; 391: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). An intact UBA domain is required for efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl and Cbl-b proteins downstream from the EGF and insulin RTKs (2Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Liu J. DeYoung S.M. Hwang J.B. O'Leary E.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36754-36762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hence, the Cbl UBA domain may play a role in the recruitment of Cbl proteins to these RTKs. This domain was originally thought to be a leucine zipper dimerization motif (2Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), which contains leucine/isoleucine residues spaced every seventh amino acid residue along one side of an α-helix. Several approaches, including yeast two-hybrid, far Western, and in vitro binding assays, have shown that the putative leucine zipper motif can mediate homodimerization of c-Cbl (2Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the same motif could also mediate homodimerization of Cbl-b and heterodimerization of c-Cbl/Cbl-b (3Liu J. DeYoung S.M. Hwang J.B. O'Leary E.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36754-36762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, from bioinformatics analyses, the putative leucine zipper in c-Cbl and Cbl-b has the sequence pattern of a UBA domain (4Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem.

UBA domains are protein-protein interaction modules that utilize hydrophobic surfaces to recognize their binding partners. The three-dimensional structures of a number of UBA domains have been determined using NMR and x-ray crystallography (5Chang Y.G. Song A.X. Gao Y.G. Shi Y.H. Lin X.J. Cao X.T. Lin D.H. Hu H.Y.

Despite low sequence homology, their three-dimensional structures are very similar, consisting of a bundle of three α-helices. The majority of UBA domains studied bind to ubiquitin or ubiquitin-like domains using a hydrophobic patch of residues in the α1-α2 loop and helix α3 (10Mueller T.D. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1243-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Besides c-Cbl UBA, other UBA and UBA-like domains have been implicated in homodimerization (15Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J.

Biol. 2001; 313: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms involved in dimerization of Cbl UBA domains are poorly understood. Here, we report the crystal structure of the human c-Cbl UBA domain. In combination with NMR, site-directed mutagenesis, and biochemical studies, it shows that Cbl UBA domains have a conserved hydrophobic surface, which is utilized for their homo- and heterodimerization. To address the function of the UBA domains in Cbl proteins, we show that an intact UBA domain is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl proteins and ubiquitination of the Met receptor. Generation of DNA Constructs—The UBA domain from c-Cbl (residues 856-895) was cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences) and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) in rich (LB) medium as a fusion protein with an amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase tag. Human c-Cbl was tagged with either an HA or a FLAG epitope at their amino terminus and subcloned in the pMX139 mammalian expression vector. The c-CblΔUBA construct was generated by adding a stop codon at Pro855 in c-Cbl, using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the same kit and confirmed by DNA sequencing. c-Cbl-FKBP was constructed by subcloning c-CblΔUBA into the pC4Fv1E vector from the ARGENT Regulated Homodimerization kit (www.ariad.com/regulationkits, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) to generate FKBP fused to the COOH terminus of c-CblΔUBA. DNA Transfections, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting—Transient transfections in HeLa and HEK 293 cells were performed using Lipofectamine Plus reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). HEK 293 cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection. For HGF stimulation of HeLa cells, 24 h post-transfection, the cells were serum-starved for 24 h. They were then stimulated with 1.5 nm HGF for the indicated amount of time. HGF was a generous gift from George Vande Woude (Van Andel Research Institute, Grand Rapids, MI). To induce the dimerization of the Cbl-FKBP fusion proteins, cells were treated with 100 nm AP20187 (ARIAD Pharmaceuticals) 30 min prior to HGF stimulation. To examine in vivo ubiquitination of Met, cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (0.05% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 nm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate) with inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mg/ml aprotinin, and 10 mg/ml leupeptin). Otherwise, cells were lysed in TGH lysis buffer with inhibitors (50 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol). Immunoprecipitations were carried out at 4 °C for 2 h with gentle rotation with the indicated antibody. Proteins collected on either protein A- or G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) were washed three times in their respective lysis buffers, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitro-cellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies in TBST for 2 and 1 h, respectively. After four washes with TBST, bound proteins were visualized with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). The immunoblots were quantified using ImageJ 1.36b (Wayne Rasband, National Institutes of Health). Protein Expression, Preparation, and Purification—For production of a selenomethionine-labeled protein, the c-Cbl UBA expression plasmid was transformed into the E. coli methionine auxotroph strain DL41T7(DE3) (18Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Selenomethionine-labeled protein was produced using LeMaster medium (18Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). For NMR experiments, the recombinant fragments were labeled by growth of E. coli BL21 in M9 minimal medium with 15N-ammonium sulfate or 15N-ammonium sulfate/13C-glucose as the sole sources of nitrogen and carbon. Cells were harvested and broken in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.8. The glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose resin and tags were removed by cleavage with thrombin, leaving Gly-Ser NH2-terminal and Ala-Ala-Ala-Ser COOH-terminal extensions for the c-Cbl UBA domain. The cleaved protein was additionally purified using C18 reverse phase chromatography. Selenomethionine-labeled protein was purified in a similar manner. Crystallization—Initial crystallization conditions were identified utilizing hanging drop vapor diffusion using sparse matrix screens (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA). Crystals of c-Cbl UBA were obtained by equilibrating a 0.6-μl drop of a protein (15 mg/ml) in 20 mm ammonium phosphate, mixed with 0.6 μl of reservoir solution containing 3.8 m sodium formate, 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5, and 4% (v/v) glycerol and suspended over 1 ml of reservoir solution. Crystals grew in 2-4 days at 20 °C. For data collection, crystals were picked up in a nylon loop and flash cooled in a N2 cold stream (Oxford Cryosystem). Crystals belong to a primitive tetragonal system, space group P41212 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 82.0, c = 56.2 Å. The crystals contain three molecules in the asymmetric unit (Z = 24) corresponding to Vm = 3.11 Å3 Da-1 and a solvent content of 60.4%. Structure Solution and Refinement—Diffraction data from a selenomethionine-labeled crystal of c-Cbl UBA domain were collected using a three-wavelength MAD regime on a Quantum-4 CCD detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.) at beamline F2 at the Cornell High-Energy Synchrotron Source (Table 1). Data processing and scaling were performed with HKL2000 (19Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38453) Google Scholar). The structure was determined by SAD phasing using the program SOLVE/RESOLVE (20Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Data to 2.1-Å resolution at the maximum peak wavelength (λ = 0.9790) were used to locate selenium atoms in the asymmetric unit. The asymmetric unit contains three UBAc molecules. Density modification with the program ARP/wARP (21Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) allowed for automated model building of almost complete chains A and B. The model obtained from ARP/wARP was extended manually using program Xfit (22McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar) and was improved by several cycles of refinement, using the program REFMAC (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar). The refined chain A was used in molecular replacement program PHASER (24Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar) to locate chain C, followed by several cycles of refinement and refitting for this chain using Xfit (22McRee D.E. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 125: 156-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). In addition, 73 water molecules were included in the model. The final model was subjected to translation-libration-screw refinement (25Winn M.D. Murshudov G.N. Papiz M.Z. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 300-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar). Of 46 residues in the c-Cbl UBA construct, the final model does not include residues Gln856-Leu857 for chain C in addition to the very NH2- and COOH-terminal residues from the linkers for chains B and C. The final model has an Rwork factor of 0.216 and Rfree of 0.260 for all data to 2.1-Å resolution (Table 1) and has excellent stereochemistry computed using PROCHECK (26Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W.

Open table in a new tab NMR Spectroscopy—NMR resonance assignments of the UBA domain from c-Cbl were carried out using 15N-labeled and 13C,15N-labeled protein samples. Protein signal assignments were performed using standard techniques, including three-dimensional experiments HNCACB, CBCA(CO)NH, and 15N-nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation. NMR samples contained 0.5-1.0 mm protein in 50 mm phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.8. NMR sample preparation and signal assignments for the Cbl-b UBA domain are described elsewhere (27Peschard P.

For heterodimerization NMR titrations, unlabeled UBA domain from Cbl-b or c-Cbl was added to the 15N-labeled 0.25-0.5 mm c-Cbl or Cbl-b UBA, respectively, to the final molar ratio of (6 ÷ 7) to 1. All NMR experiments were performed at 303 K using Varian 500 and 800 MHz spectrometers and a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer. NMR self-diffusion experiments were acquired at 300 K. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPipe (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

UBA Domain Is Required for c-Cbl Dimerization—Despite their high sequence identity (Fig. 1), the UBA domains from c-Cbl and Cbl-b display remarkably different ubiquitin-binding abilities. Whereas the UBA domain of Cbl-b binds ubiquitin chains with high affinity, the UBA domain of c-Cbl shows no binding (30Davies G.C. Ettenberg S.A. Coats A.O. Mussante M. Ravichandran S. Collins J.

The UBA domain of c-Cbl and Cbl-b has been implicated in Cbl homodimerization and heterodimerization but nothing is known about their dimerization interface (2Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Liu J. DeYoung S.M. Hwang J.B. O'Leary E.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36754-36762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To confirm that the UBA domain is required for the homodimerization of c-Cbl, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments with HA and FLAG-tagged c-Cbl protein. Following transient expression, FLAG-c-Cbl efficiently coimmunoprecipitates with HA-c-Cbl, consistent with its homodimerization (Fig. 2A). In agreement with previous results (3Liu J. DeYoung S.M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 36754-36762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), deletion of the c-Cbl UBA domain abrogated the ability of c-Cbl to homodimerize, whereas deletion of a prolinerich region in the carboxyl-terminal region does not affect dimerization (Fig. 2A). To establish the ability of the c-Cbl UBA domain to dimerize in solution we performed NMR self-diffusion measurements (Fig. 2B and supplemental Table S1). The UBA domain showed an apparent size of ∼10 kDa, consistent with the molecular mass of a dimer.FIGURE 2Dimerization of the c-Cbl UBA domain. A, the UBA domain of c-Cbl is required for its homodimerization. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with FLAG-tagged c-Cbl wild-type (wt) and HA-tagged c-Cbl WT or mutants (c-CblΔ6Pro, deletion of prolines 542 to 548, c-CblΔ472-645). FLAG-tagged c-Cbl was immunoprecipitated (IP) and revolved by SDS-PAGE. The presence of HA-c-Cbl proteins in the immunoprecipitate was detected by Western blotting (IB).

Dependence of the signal intensity (I) from the gradient strength (G) results in slopes that are equal to diffusion coefficients. The gradient strength was calibrated by the PFG experiment for lysozyme (D = 1.34 × 10-6 at 303 K) (40Ekiel I. Abrahamson M. Fulton D.B. Lindahl P. Storer A.C. Levadoux W. Lafrance M. Labelle S.

The crystals in symmetry space group P41212 contain three molecules in the asymmetric unit. The chains were traced from Gln856 (Ser858 in chain C) to Phe895. All three chains are nearly identical, as their backbone could be overlaid with root mean square deviations between 0.29 and 0.45 Å. Despite the odd number of molecules in the asymmetric unit, the crystal packing clearly displayed dimeric species. Whereas chains A and B within the asymmetric unit formed a tightly packed dimer, chain C makes a similar dimer with its counterpart from the adjacent asymmetric unit across the crystallographic axis. As in the case with single chains, overlay of both dimers results in a low root mean square deviation value of 0.93 Å. Each chain has a typical UBA fold consisting of a three-helical bundle (α1-α3) (Fig. 3A). The domain has a well defined hydrophobic core that includes Leu857, Ile861, Leu864, Ile874, Leu878, Ile885, and Leu892. Noticeably, Tyr869 from the α1-α2 loop is a part of the core stacking against Leu892 (Fig. 3B). Most of the remaining hydrophobic residues are located on the α2-α3 surface and participate in dimer formation. Two protomers form a symmetric dimer through hydrophobic contacts of Ile880, Met887, Ile891, and Phe895 (Fig. 3C). Whereas both helices, α2 and α3, make close intermolecular contacts in the dimer, helix 3 is particularly important as it provides three of four hydrophobic residues for dimerization. Interestingly, the side chain of Met887 from one protomer contacts the same residue from the second protomer (Fig. 3C). Intermolecular salt bridges between Lys876 and Glu894 further stabilize the dimer (Fig. 3D). Apart from Met887, the residues forming contacts in the c-Cbl UBA homodimer are conserved in Cbl-b (Fig. 1). Overall, the dimerization surface observed in the crystal structure corresponds to the most conserved regions of Cbl UBA domains (helix α3 and the loop between helices α2 and α3) (Fig. 1). The recently released solution structure of the UBA domain from mouse c-Cbl (Protein Data Bank code 2D9S) is largely similar to our crystal structure, confirming that the dimerization interface observed in the crystal does not result from crystal packing. c-Cbl UBA Employs the Same Surface to Homo- and Heterodimerize in Solution—To study heterodimerization between c-Cbl and Cbl-b UBA domains we used NMR titration of 15N-labeled c-Cbl UBA with its unlabeled counterpart. The heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum of the 15N-labeled c-Cbl UBA domain showed a good dispersion of signals characteristic of well folded domains (Fig. 4A). These were assigned using standard heteronuclear techniques. Heterodimerization experiments resulted in a slow-exchange mode as signals for both c-Cbl UBA homodimers and c-Cbl/Cbl-b heterodimers were present during the NMR titration (Fig. 4B). The c-Cbl UBA domain showed specific spectral changes, identifying the regions affected by heterodimerization (Fig. 4, C and D). These regions coincide with the homodimerization surface of the c-Cbl UBA. Based on the slow-exchange mode in heterodimerization experiments (Fig. 4B), we estimate the high limit of Kd for c-Cbl UBA homodimerization to be in a low micromolar range. Likewise, titration of the 15N-labeled Cbl-b UBA domain with unlabeled c-Cbl UBA also resulted in similar chemical shift changes. When mapped to the Cbl-b UBA structure (PDB ID code 2OOA), the same α2-α3 surface of Cbl-b UBA was affected (Fig. 4, E and F). This shows that the surface employed for homodimerization in c-Cbl UBA is also used for heterodimerization by both c-Cbl and Cbl-b UBA domains. Because NMR is very sensitive to even low-affinity interactions, and because the Cbl-b UBA domain, but not c-Cbl UBA domain, has been shown to bind to ubiquitin in vitro (30Davies G.C. Ettenberg S.A. Coats A.O. Mussante M. Ravichandran S. Collins J. Nau M.M. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7104-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we probed binding between the c-Cbl UBA domain and ubiquitin using NMR titrations. Even a high (6:1) ratio of unlabeled ubiquitin to 15N-labeled c-Cbl UBA failed to produce detectable chemical shift changes in the UBA heteronuclear single quantum correlation spectrum (data not shown), confirming the lack of binding between these molecules. Disruption of the Dimerization Interface of UBA Impairs Cbl Functions—Recruitment of c-Cbl and Cbl-b proteins to the Met receptor promotes its ubiquitination and is required for efficient receptor degradation and suppression of its transforming activity (32Peschard P.

Lipkowitz S. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29565-29571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To test the biological role of UBA domains in Cbl proteins, we performed functional studies (Fig. 5). When transiently co-expressed with wild-type c-Cbl, the Met receptor becomes ubiquitinated (Fig. 5B). In contrast, a mutant of c-Cbl lacking the UBA domain (c-CblΔUBA) is unable to induce efficient ubiquitination of Met (Fig. 5B), demonstrating a requirement for the UBA domain in this process. An intact UBA domain was previously shown to be required for tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl downstream of the EGF and insulin RTKs (2Bartkiewicz M. Houghton A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30887-30895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3Liu J. DeYoung S.M. Hwang J.B. O'Leary E.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36754-36762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Hence, the CblΔUBA proteins may be inefficient at inducing Met receptor ubiquitination as a result of decreased recruitment to Met. Because tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl by RTKs is considered to reflect the recruitment of Cbl, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of c-CblΔUBA in response to activation of the Met receptor by its ligand, HGF. Whereas wild-type c-Cbl is efficiently tyrosine phosphorylated at 2 and 10 min following stimulation, c-CblΔUBA is not, supporting a role for an intact UBA domain for Cbl recruitment to the Met receptor (Fig. 5C). To confirm the physiological relevance of the c-Cbl dimerization mechanism, and its requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Cbl, and ubiquitination of the Met RTK, we substituted Ile880 and Ile891 for glutamic acid residues. The mutant was structured as verified by the one-dimensional NMR spectrum (supplemental materials Fig. 1). According to the c-C"

Furthermore, after endocytosis, receptors are recycled back to the plasma membrane, retained in intracellular compartments, or targeted for degradation. Thus, sorting of receptors between these fates is critical for determining the role that endocytosis plays in regulating signal transduction. For receptors that are recycled, endocytosis provides a mechanism for resensitizing them to the presence of ligand. For receptors that are degraded, endocytosis serves as the first step toward down-regulation (for review, see Ref. 2Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. Pharmacol.

Many membrane proteins, including the transferrin receptor, recycle after endocytosis by default, presumably due to bulk membrane recycling (3Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Several GPCRs have also been postulated to recycle by default. However, a number of GPCRs have been shown to require protein motifs within their cytoplasmic tails to be efficiently recycled. This has led to the hypothesis that specific “recycling proteins” exist that interact with these domains and promote GPCR recycling. In some cases, these recycling proteins have been identified. For example, the β2 adrenergic receptor (B2AR) interacts with NHERF/EBP50 (4Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), NSF (5Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2265-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), all of which appear to contribute to recycling of the receptor. Disruption of the interaction between the B2AR and any of these proteins prevents receptor recycling and promotes receptor degradation. In other cases, for example, the μ opioid peptide receptor (MOP-R) (7Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Several proteins have been described that appear to regulate the postendocytic sorting of GPCRs to the degradative pathway. These include the sorting nexins (for review, see Ref. 9Carlton J. Bujny M.

Von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). GASP1 is an intriguing sorting protein in that it shows selectivity for individual members of GPCR families. For example, GASP1 interacts with the δ opioid peptide receptor (DOP-R) but not the MOP-R (11Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M.

Neurochem. 2004; 89: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although the functional significance of these interactions have yet to be established. Together, these data suggest that GASP1 may be an important universal regulator of postendocytic GPCR degradation. GASP1 has a highly homologous homolog, GASP2, and is weakly homologous to several other proteins of unknown function (16Simonin F. Karcher P. Boeuf J.J. Matifas A. Kieffer B.L. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 766-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Here we show that GASP1 and GASP2 bind to several mutant receptors. Both a mutant B2AR that is targeted for degradation (4Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and a mutant MOP-R (7Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) that is targeted for degradation interact with GASP. In the case of the B2AR, the addition of an alanine to the extreme C terminus disrupts the PDZ domain-mediated interaction of the B2AR with NHERF/EBP50 (4Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, the resulting receptor, B-alaR, interacts with GASP and is degraded. In the case of the MOP-R, deletion of a small motif within the cytoplasmic tail enhances the interaction of the receptor with GASP both in vitro and in HEK293 cells. The resulting receptor is thus degraded after endocytosis. However, a mutant D1R, which fails to recycle due to the deletion of a small motif within its cytoplasmic tail (8Vargas G.A. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37461-37469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), does not show an increased affinity for GASP either in vitro or in vivo. Importantly, although this mutant D1R does not recycle, it is also not targeted for degradation. Thus, we show that facilitating interaction of a receptor with GASP, either by disrupting an interaction with a recycling protein or by enhancing the affinity of the receptor for GASP via mutation, can alter the postendocytic fate of the receptor. Thus, either “recycling motifs” can have defined binding proteins that associate with them to affect trafficking or they may provide structural determinants that prevent the binding of GASP.

Concurrent with ligand treatment 100% and strip plates remained at 4 °C. After ligand treatment, plates were washed in PBS, and remaining cell surface-biotinylated receptors were stripped in 50 mm glutathione, 0.3 m NaCl, 75 mm NaOH, 1% fetal bovine serum at 4 °C for 30 min. Cells were quenched with PBS containing 50 mm iodoacetamide, 1% bovine serum albumin and then lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland). Cleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, treated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs) for 1 h, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized with streptavidin overlay (Vectastain ABC immunoperoxidase reagent, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). For quantification, at least three blots for each condition were quantified by using Scion IMAGE software package. Agonist treatment for 30 min was designated 100% for each agonist/condition tested. Co-immunoprecipitation of Receptors and GASP—HEK293 cells stably expressing MOP-R, MOP-TR, B2AR, B-alaR, D1R, D1-TR, or no heterologous receptor were grown to confluency and washed twice with PBS, and lysates were prepared as described previously (11Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) in 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl,10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors. Cleared lysate was incubated with M2 anti-FLAG affinity resin (Sigma) for 1 h at 4°C, washed extensively, and deglycosylated with PNGase F for 1 h. Precipitates were resolved on a 4–20% gradient Tris·HCl precast gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and the blots were cut below the 75-kDa marker band to separately immunoblot for either receptor (lower blot) or GASP (upper blot). GASP blots were incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-GASP (1:1,000) and for 1 h with horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (New England Biolabs) (1:4,000, 1 h at room temperature) and then visualized with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Receptor blots were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated M2 antibody (1:250) (Sigma) and then visualized with streptavidin overlay (Vectastain ABC reagents, Vector Laboratories) and ECL Plus. Co-immunoprecipitation of Receptors with GFP·cGASP and NHERF/EBP50—HEK293 cells stably expressing B2AR or B-alaR alone or stably expressing B2AR and GFP·cGASP or B-alaR and GFP·cGASP were grown to confluency and washed twice with PBS, and lysates were prepared as described previously (11Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) in 0.1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, with protease inhibitors. Cleared lysate was incubated with M2 anti-FLAG affinity resin (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed extensively, and deglycosylated with N-glycosidase F for 1 h. Precipitates were divided in two and were resolved on a 8% gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were cut below the 75-kDa marker band and separately immunoblotted for receptor, EBP50, or GFP·cGASP. GFP·cGASP blots were incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-GFP (1:1,000, Clontech) and for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (New England Biolabs) (1:4,000, 1 h at room temperature) and then visualized with ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). Receptor blots were incubated for 1 h with biotinylated M2 antibody (1:250) (Sigma) and then visualized with streptavidin overlay (Vectastain ABC reagents, Vector Laboratories) and ECL Plus. In Vitro Transcription/Translation—The full-length coding sequence of GASP1 or GASP2 was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). In vitro translation of these constructs was performed in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine (Amersham Biosciences) using the T7 RNA polymerase promoter and a coupled in vitro transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI). GST Fusion Protein Affinity Chromatography—Cytoplasmic receptor tails downstream of the conserved NPXXY motif for MOP-R, MOP-TR, B2AR, B-alaR, D1R, and D1-TR were amplified by PCR, cloned into a pGEX-4T1 vector, and expressed in E. coli. GST fusion proteins were prepared as described (11Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The GST fusion protein loads of individual constructs were determined before the GST pull-down experiment and confirmed by Coomassie Blue stain of the gel. For affinity chromatography of in vitro translated GASP1 or GASP2 on the different receptor tails, 30 μl of the GST fusion protein-loaded resins (50% (v/v) suspensions) were preblocked in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4,100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature. In vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled proteins were incubated with the GST fusion protein resins in binding buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Resins were washed four times with binding buffer and eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. GASP1 and GASP2 binding was analyzed by autoradiography. Mutant B2ARs Bind GASP and Degrade—Following agonist stimulation and internalization, the B2AR is rapidly recycled to the plasma membrane (18von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3530-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recycling is dependent on the interaction of the receptor with either NHERF/EPB50 (4Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and/or NSF (5Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45145-45152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) through a PDZ domain in the C terminus of the receptor. The addition of a single alanine residue to the C terminus disrupts the PDZ domain and prevents recycling of the receptor (4Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). In fact, disruption of this interaction not only prevents recycling but promotes targeting of the internalized mutant B2AR away from recycling compartments and into lysosomal compartments. Specifically, internalized wild type (B2AR), but not mutant (B-alaR) receptors, colocalize with the early endosome marker, transferrin (Fig. 1A). Conversely, internalized mutant, but not wild type receptors, colocalize with the late endosome and lysosomal markers LAMP1 and -2 (Fig. 1B). Next, we used the biotin protection/degradation assay to specifically monitor the postendocytic fate of the B2AR and the mutant B-alaR. Both the B2AR and the B-alaR were efficiently internalized upon stimulation with the agonist isoproterenol (Fig. 2A, iso 30′) when compared with receptors in cells that were not treated with agonist (Fig. 2A, NT 30′). The internalized “protected” pool of B2ARs was relatively stable, even under constant agonist pressure, for 3 h (Fig. 2A, compare iso 30′ with iso 180′), although some degradation of the internalized pool did occur (quantification in Fig. 2B). In contrast, the internalized protected pool of the mutant B-alaR was nearly completely degraded after 3 h (Fig. 2A, compare iso 30′ with iso 180′). This result was not necessarily expected. Disrupting the recycling of the V2 vasopressin receptor, for example, leads to retention of the receptor in endocytic vesicles, not receptor degradation (19Innamorati G. Sadeghi H.M. Tran N.T. Birnbaumer M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2222-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Hence, degradation does not appear to be the default pathway for receptors that fail to recycle. Thus, we hypothesized that the mutant B-alaR was specifically targeted for degradation after endocytosis. Previously, the GPCR-associated sorting protein, GASP, has been shown to target several GPCRs for degradation after endocytosis, including the DOP-R (11Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), the D2R (12Bartlett S.E. Enquist J. Hopf F.W. Lee J.H. Gladher F. Kharazia V.

Pharmacol. 2007; 71: 494-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We thus asked whether GASP could be mediating the degradation of the B-alaR. In vitro, both GASP1 and GASP2 bound with similar affinity to the cytoplasmic tails of the wild type B2AR and to the B-alaR (Fig. 3A). However, in HEK293 cells, GASP co-immunoprecipitated selectively with the mutant B-alaR but not with the wild-type B2AR (Fig. 3B). Together, these results suggest that the absolute affinity of GASP for the B2AR is not affected by the addition of an alanine to the C terminus but rather that interaction of the wild-type receptor with a recycling protein present in HEK293 cells, presumably NHERF/EBP50 (4Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and/or NSF (5Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45145-45152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), is preventing the receptor from interacting with GASP. We hypothesize that disruption of the interaction between receptor and NHERF/EBP50 and/or NSF, through the addition of an alanine, allows GASP to access the receptor. This hypothesis is supported by the observations that wild type B2ARs, but not B-alaRs, co-immunoprecipitate with NHERF/EBP50 and NSF (Fig. 3E) (4Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 5Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Overexpression of the dominant negative GASP, cGASP, has been shown to disrupt the interaction of receptors, including the DOP-R (11Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), D2R (12Bartlett S.E. Enquist J. Hopf F.W. Lee J.H. Gladher F. Kharazia V. Waldhoer M. Mailliard W.S. Armstrong R. Bonci A. Whistler J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 11521-11526Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the CB1 receptor (13Martini L. Waldhoer M. Pusch M. Kharazia V. Fong J. Lee J.H. Freissmuth C. Whistler J.L. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 802-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), with endogenous GASP. If GASP were mediating the degradation of the B-alaR, one would expect that cGASP overexpression could inhibit receptor degradation. Indeed, stable overexpression of cGASP in cells expressing the mutant B-alaR delayed receptor degradation (Fig. 3D). Together, these results suggest that disrupting interaction of the B2AR with NHERF/EBP50 and/or NSF does at least two things; first, it prevents recycling of the receptor, and second, it allows the receptor to interact with GASP, which targets the receptor for degradation. Overexpression of cGASP does not affect the recycling of the wild-type B2AR, which recycles in the presence or absence of cGASP (data not shown). However, overexpression of cGASP does decrease the amount of NHERF/EBP50 that is associated with the B2AR (Fig. 3E), suggesting that GASP, in this case cGASP, and NHERF/EBP50 compete for receptor binding. Nevertheless, as they do for endogenous GASP, B2ARs show a lower affinity for cGASP than do B-alaRs (Fig. 3E, compare the B2AR + GFP·cGASP and B-alaR + GFP·cGASP lanes). Thus, under conditions where only endogenous GASP and NHERF/EBP50 are present, binding of NHERF/EBP50 to the B2AR predominates. However, overexpression of cGASP, ∼40-fold over endogenous GASP (data not shown), can shift this balance to favor less EBP50 and more cGASP binding. We did not examine whether stable overexpression of full-length GASP could likewise compete with NHERF/EBP50 and thereby change B2AR trafficking because overexpression of full-length GASP dramatically affected cell viability (11Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S.R. Von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Mutant MOP-Rs Bind GASP and Degrade—The wild type MOP-R has been shown to rapidly recycle following internalization in heterologous expression systems (11Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J.

Grandy D.K. Williams J.T. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5769-5776Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (25Szeto H.H. Soong Y. Wu D. Fasolo J. Anesth. Analg. 2001; 93: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Truncation of the MOP-R or deletion of a small sequence in the C terminus of the receptor has been shown to disrupt its recycling (7Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These results led to the hypothesis that there was an as yet unidentified sorting protein that bound to the C terminus of the MOP-R that facilitated its recycling (7Tanowitz M. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 45978-45986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, truncation of the MOP-R (MOP-TR) not only inhibits its recycling but also appears to redirect the receptor to the degradative pathway. Internalized wild type MOP-R, but not MOP-TR, is primarily co-localized with the early endosomal marker transferrin (Fig. 4A), whereas internalized MOP-TR, but not MOP-R, is primarily localized to late endosomes and lysosomes (Fig. 4B). We again used the biotin protection/degradation assay to specifically monitor the postendocytic fate of internalized MOP and MOP-T receptors. Both receptors were efficiently internalized in response to the agonist ligand etorphine (Fig. 5A, ET 30′). However, although the internalized pool of MOP-R was relatively stable even under constant agonist pressure for 3 h (Fig. 5A, upper panel, compare ET 30′ with ET 180′), the MOP-TR was substantially degraded at this time point (Fig. 5A, lower panel, compare ET 30′ with ET 180′). Overall, the MOP-TR was degraded more quickly and more completely than the wild type MOP-R (Fig. 5B). Thus, truncation of the MOP-R does not appear to merely inhibit recycling but also appears to enhance degradation. We next examined whether GASP could be responsible for the degradation of the MOP-TR. In fact, even in vitro, both GASP1 and GASP2 showed a higher affinity for the MOP-TR than for the MOP-R (Fig. 6A). This is in contrast to observations with the wild type B2AR and mutant B-alaR, which showed equivalent in vitro affinity for GASP1 and GASP2 (Fig. 3A). These data suggest that truncation of the MOP-R can directly alter the affinity of the receptor for GASP. Thus, truncation of the MOP-R may not remove a binding site for a recycling protein but may instead unmask a GASP binding site. Consistent with this hypothesis, in HEK293 cells, both GASP1 and GASP2 co-immunoprecipitated with the MOP-TR but not with the MOP-R (Fig. 6, C and D). Mutant D1s That Fail to Recycle but Do Not Degrade Do Not Bind GASP—D1 dopamine receptors, such as B2ARs and MOP-Rs, have been shown to rapidly recycle after endocytosis (12Bartlett S.E. Enquist J. Hopf F.W. Lee J.H. Gladher F. Kharazia V. Waldhoer M. Mailliard W.S. Armstrong R. Bonci A. Whistler J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, in contrast to the B2AR and the MOP-R, truncation of the D1R inhibits its recycling without promoting its down-regulation (8Vargas G.A. Von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37461-37469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) (Fig. 7). Consistent with its stability even in the absence of recycling, D1-TRs did not show an increased affinity for GASP either in vitro (Fig. 8A) or in HEK293 cells (Fig. 8, B and C). This is in contrast to truncated MOP-Rs, which showed an increased affinity for GASP (Fig. 6) and were thus degraded (Fig. 5). Together, these data suggest that merely preventing recycling does not necessarily promote receptor degradation unless affinity for sorting proteins, such as GASP, that mediate degradation are altered as well.FIGURE 8D1R and D1-TR show similar GASP affinity. A, radioactively labeled, recombinant GASP1 and GASP2 produced by in vitro translation were incubated with GST alone or GST fusion protein containing the cytoplasmic tail of D1R, D1-TR, or D2R as a positive control.

For the B2AR, our results suggest that there is an interplay between recycling proteins (NHERF/EBP50 and NSF) and degrading proteins (GASP1 and GASP2), which determines the postendocytic fate of the B2AR. In HEK293 cells, the recycling proteins appear to “win” in that recycling is the predominant fate of the receptor, and the majority of B2ARs co-immunoprecipitate with NHERF/EBP50 (4Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) and NSF (5Cong M. Perry S.J. Hu L.A. Hanson P.I. Claing A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45145-45152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) rather than with GASP. Binding of the wild-type receptor to NHERF/EBP50 and/or NSF may directly occlude the interaction of the receptor with GASP. Alternatively, binding of NHERF/EBP50 and/or NSF could change the conformation of the receptor and thereby decrease the affinity of GASP for the receptor. Importantly, the PDZ domain interactions that promote recycling of the B2AR are regulated by phosphorylation (4Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Thus, in cell types or under conditions where the B2AR is phosphorylated, the degrading proteins would be expected to predominate. In contrast, for the MOP-R, structural sequence determinants within the cytoplasmic tail appear to prevent degradation of the MOP-R by interfering with GASP binding. This enhanced affinity for GASP by the truncated receptor appears to be independent of any competing recycling protein since the enhanced affinity is observed even in vitro. It remains to be determined whether modifications of the MOP-R tail, such as phosphorylation, could alter GASP affinity by changing the conformation of the structural determinants that prevent or enhance GASP binding. In short, mutations or modifications that prevent recycling of GPCRs may do so by disrupting interactions with recycling proteins, including unidentified ones such as appears to be the case with the truncated D1R or identified ones, such as NHERF/EBP50 for the B2AR. Alternatively, mutations or modifications can directly promote the interaction of receptors with degrading proteins such as GASP, as appears to be the case for the truncated MOP-R. Postendocytic sorting of GPCRs plays a crucial role in determining whether receptor endocytosis serves a resensitization or down-regulatory function in signal transduction. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that key sorting proteins appear to have conserved roles across multiple GPCR families. We thank Lene Martini and Li He for critical reading of the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2032322183,"The large conductance, voltage- and Ca2+-activated K+ channel plays key roles in diverse body functions influenced by estrogen, including smooth muscle and neural activities. In mouse (m), estrogen up-regulates the transcript levels of its pore-forming α-subunit (Slo, KCNMA1), yet the underlying genomic mechanism(s) is (are) unknown. We first mapped the promoters and regulatory motifs within the mSlo 5′-flanking sequence to subsequently identify genomic regions and mechanisms required for estrogen regulation. mSlo gene has at least two TATA-less promoters with distinct potencies that may direct mSlo transcription from multiple transcription start sites. These qualities mark mSlo as a prototype gene with promoter plasticity capable of generating multiple mRNAs and the potential to adapt to organismal needs. mSlo promoters contain multiple estrogen-responsive sequences, e.g. two quasi-perfect estrogen-responsive elements, ERE1 and ERE2, and Sp1 sites. Accordingly, mSlo promoter activity was highly enhanced by estrogen and blocked by estrogen antagonist ICI 182,780. When promoters are embedded in a 4.91-kb backbone, estrogen responsiveness involves a classical genomic mechanism, via ERE1 and ERE2, that may be complemented by Sp factors, particularly Sp1. Simultaneous but not individual ERE1 and ERE2 mutations caused significant loss of estrogen action. ERE2, which is closer to the proximal promoter, up-regulates this promoter via a classical genomic mechanism. ERE2 strategic position together with ERE1 and ERE2 independence and Sp contribution should ensure mSlo estrogen responsiveness. Thus, the mSlo gene seems to have uniquely evolved to warrant estrogen regulation. Estrogen-mediated mSlo genomic regulation has important implications on long term estrogenic effects affecting smooth muscle and neural functions."
https://openalex.org/W1973449380,"The HAMP domain plays an essential role in signal transduction not only in histidine kinase but also in a number of other signal-transducing receptor proteins. Here we expressed the EnvZ HAMP domain (Arg180–Thr235) with the R218K mutation (termed LRK) or with LRK connected with domain A (Arg180–Arg289) (termed LARK) of EnvZ, an osmosensing transmembrane histidine kinase in Escherichia coli, by fusing it with protein S. The LRK and LARK proteins were purified after removing protein S. The CD analysis of the isolated L protein revealed that it consists of a random structure or is unstructured. This suggests that the EnvZ HAMP domain by itself is unable to form a stable structure and that this structural fragility may be important for its role in signal transduction. Interestingly the substitution of Ala193 in the EnvZ HAMP domain with valine or leucine in Tez1A1, a chimeric protein of Tar and EnvZ, caused a constitutive OmpC phenotype. The CD analysis of LARK(A193L) revealed that this mutated HAMP domain possesses considerable secondary structures and that the thermostability of this entire LARK(A193L) became substantially lower than that of LARK or just domain A, indicating that the structure of the HAMP domain with the A193L mutation affects the stability of downstream domain A. This results in cooperative thermodenaturation of domain A with the mutated HAMP domain. These results are discussed in light of the recently solved NMR structure of the HAMP domain from a thermophilic bacterium (Hulko, M., Berndt, F., Gruber, M., Linder, J. U., Truffault, V., Schultz, A., Martin, J., Schultz, J. E., Lupas, A. N., and Coles, M. (2006) Cell 126, 929–940)."
https://openalex.org/W1985139909,"The cytotoxic action of ribonucleases (RNases) requires the interaction of the enzyme with the cellular membrane, its internalization, translocation to the cytosol, and the degradation of ribonucleic acid. The interplay of these processes as well as the role of the thermodynamic and proteolytic stability, the catalytic activity, and the evasion from the intracellular ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) has not yet been fully elucidated. As cytosolic internalization is indispensable for the cytotoxicity of extracellular ribonucleases, we investigated the extent of cytosolic internalization of a cytotoxic, RI-evasive RNase A variant (G88R-RNase A) and of various similarly cytotoxic but RI-sensitive RNase A tandem enzyme variants in comparison to the internalization of the non-cytotoxic and RI-sensitive RNase A. After incubation of K-562 cells with the RNase A variants for 36 h, the internalized amount of RNases was analyzed by rapid cell disruption followed by subcellular fractionation and semiquantitative immunoblotting. The data indicate that an enhanced cellular uptake and an increased entry of the RNases into the cytosol can outweigh the abolishment of catalytic activity by RI. As all RNase A variants proved to be resistant to the proteases present in the different subcellular fractions for more than 100 h, our results suggest that the cytotoxic potency of RNases is determined by an efficient internalization into the cytosol. The cytotoxic action of ribonucleases (RNases) requires the interaction of the enzyme with the cellular membrane, its internalization, translocation to the cytosol, and the degradation of ribonucleic acid. The interplay of these processes as well as the role of the thermodynamic and proteolytic stability, the catalytic activity, and the evasion from the intracellular ribonuclease inhibitor (RI) has not yet been fully elucidated. As cytosolic internalization is indispensable for the cytotoxicity of extracellular ribonucleases, we investigated the extent of cytosolic internalization of a cytotoxic, RI-evasive RNase A variant (G88R-RNase A) and of various similarly cytotoxic but RI-sensitive RNase A tandem enzyme variants in comparison to the internalization of the non-cytotoxic and RI-sensitive RNase A. After incubation of K-562 cells with the RNase A variants for 36 h, the internalized amount of RNases was analyzed by rapid cell disruption followed by subcellular fractionation and semiquantitative immunoblotting. The data indicate that an enhanced cellular uptake and an increased entry of the RNases into the cytosol can outweigh the abolishment of catalytic activity by RI. As all RNase A variants proved to be resistant to the proteases present in the different subcellular fractions for more than 100 h, our results suggest that the cytotoxic potency of RNases is determined by an efficient internalization into the cytosol. The ribonucleolytic activity of ribonucleases (RNases) 2The abbreviations used are: RNase Aribonuclease Aβ-AGAN-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidaseBSAbovine serum albumincatBLScathepsins B, L, and S, fractions C, E, L, M, and T, cytosolic, endosomal, lysosomal, microsomal, and total internalization fractions, respectivelyRIribonuclease inhibitor. provides the potential to use these enzymes as therapeutics for tumor treatment. Particularly, members of the RNase A and RNase T1 superfamilies have shown promising cytotoxicity to cancer cells (1Youle R.J. D'Alessio G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F.

Among these enzymes, Onconase™ (Alfacell Corp., Bloomfield, NJ), an RNase from the Northern Leopard frog, is farthest along the clinical trials (4Pavlakis N. Vogelzang N.J. Expert. Opin. Biol. Ther. 2006; 6: 391-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To overcome the disadvantage of the renal toxicity of Onconase and a possible immunogenicity of non-mammalian RNases, RNase A or human pancreatic RNase 1 evolved as targets for the development of antitumor agents (5Leland P.A. Raines R.T. Chem. Biol. 2001; 8: 405-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Because RNases from mammalian sources are silenced due to the tight binding by the intracellular inhibitor protein (RI) and, thus, are not cytotoxic (6Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), various strategies have been mapped out to accomplish cytotoxicity.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) proved to be strategies of rather varying success, we developed RNase A tandem enzymes (22Leich F. Köditz J. Ulbrich-Hofman R. Arnold U. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in which two RNase A molecules are coupled covalently by a peptide linker. Due to steric hindrance, a complete binding by RI should be prevented and in contrast to bovine seminal RNase, the RNase A entities of the tandem constructs cannot dissociate, which would result in a subsequent binding by RI. In fact, the RNase A tandem constructs have been found to be cytotoxic, with IC50 values between 70 and 13 μm (22Leich F. Köditz J. Ulbrich-Hofman R. Arnold U. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). ribonuclease A N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase bovine serum albumin cathepsins B, L, and S, fractions C, E, L, M, and T, cytosolic, endosomal, lysosomal, microsomal, and total internalization fractions, respectively ribonuclease inhibitor. However, to unfold their cytotoxicity in the correct place, the RNases first have to reach the cytosol of the target cells by endocytosis (23Haigis M.C. Raines R.T. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) except for RNases from Rana catesbeiana and Rana japonica, which cause cell death by binding to the cell surface followed by agglutination of the cells (1Youle R.J. D'Alessio G. D'Alessio G. Riordan J.F. Ribonucleases: Structures and Functions. 1997: 491-514Google Scholar). To meet the target RNA, the RNases must be released from the endosomes into the cytosol. In contrast to Onconase, which enters the cytosol from the endosome recycling compartment (24Rodriguez M. Torrent G. Bosch M. Rayne F. Dubremetz J.F. Ribó M. Benito A. Vilanova M. Beaumelle B. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 1405-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), mammalian RNases are translocated into the cytosol from the endosomal/lysosomal pathway (21Bosch M. Benito A. Ribó M. Puig T. Beaumelle B. Vilanova M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2167-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In the endosomes (as well as in the lysosomes) and in the cytosol the RNases have to resist the attack by proteases. Furthermore, as a consequence of an estimated cytosolic concentration of RI of 1 μm (6Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), RNases with a dissociation constant (Ki) of the RNase·RI complex of <10–6 m such as RNase A should be inactivated rapidly by endogenous RI when they reach the cytosol. Thus, it has been suggested that only RNases that can evade RI binding exert cytotoxicity. While in many cases the relation between RI evasion (characterized by Ki) and cytotoxic potency (i.e. IC50 value) obviously holds true (6Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), derivatives of RNases that have been engineered to be cytotoxic still proved to be inhibited by RI (11Rybak S.M. Newton D.L. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 325-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Bosch M. Benito A. Ribó M. Puig T. Beaumelle B. Vilanova M.

FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2663-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recently, De Lorenzo et al. (27De Lorenzo C. Di Malta C. Cali G. Troise F. Nitsch L. D'Alessio G. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) could show for an antibody-RNase 1 fusion protein, which is inactivated by RI but is nevertheless strongly cytotoxic (IC50 = 50 nm) (26De Lorenzo C. Nigro A. Piccoli R. D'Alessio G. FEBS Lett. 2002; 516: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), that the amount of fusion protein that reaches the cytosol readily neutralizes the endogenous RI. Domain-swapped RNase A species, which are cytotoxic (28Matousek J. Gotte G. Pouckova P. Soucek J. Slavik T. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23817-23822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Libonati M. Gotte G. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), were found to be bound by RI with Ki values comparable with the complex of RNase A and RI (25Naddeo M. Vitagliano L. Russo A. Gotte G. D'Alessio G. Sorrentino S. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 2663-2668Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Similarly, the RNase A tandem constructs (22Leich F. Köditz J. Ulbrich-Hofman R. Arnold U. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) were completely inhibited by RI but nevertheless proved to be considerably cytotoxic. Consequently, RI evasion cannot be the reason for the cytotoxic effect exerted by the domain-swapped RNase A dimers and the RNase A tandem enzymes. A more avid endocytosis as a consequence of an improved interaction of these cationic proteins with the polyanionic cell surface was proposed as the basis for the cytotoxicity (28Matousek J. Gotte G. Pouckova P. Soucek J. Slavik T. Vottariello F. Libonati M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23817-23822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 29Libonati M. Gotte G. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). This proposal is supported by the fact that the cationization of RNase A and RNase 1 rendered these noncytotoxic proteins cytotoxic by improved interaction with the cellular surface (15Futami J. Maeda T. Kitazoe M. Nukui E. Tada H. Seno M. Kosaka M. Yamada H. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7518-7524Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We have analyzed the cellular uptake and subcellular localization of various RI-sensitive but cytotoxic RNase A tandem enzyme variants that differ in length and amino acid composition of the linker sequence in comparison with the RI-sensitive, non-cytotoxic RNase A and the RI-evasive, cytotoxic variant G88R-RNase A. The data indicate that endocytosis efficiency is a crucial factor for the magnitude of cytotoxicity of RNase A variants. Obviously, the effect of RI on RI-sensitive RNase A tandem enzymes is abolished if enough of the RNase A molecules reach the cytosol to neutralize the intracellular RI (2Benito A. Ribó M. Vilanova M. Mol. Biosyst. 2005; 1: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast, proteolytic stability proved to be not limiting for the cytotoxic potency of RNase A variants, as all used cytotoxic RNase A variants and the non-cytotoxic RNase A were stable under the applied conditions for more than 50 h. Proteins and Chemicals-RNase A from Sigma was purified on a SOURCE S FPLC column (Amersham Biosciences). Growth media for bacterial cultures were from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). Escherichia coli strains XL 1 Blue and BL21(DE3) were from Stratagene. RPMI 1640, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen; milk powder, bovine serum albumin (BSA), enzyme substrates, Nonidet P-40, and E 64 were from Sigma, and protease inhibitor mixture Complete™ was from Roche Applied Science. Polyclonal anti-RNase A antibodies were a gift from H. Younus, Aligarh Muslim University, India. Polyclonal anti-cathepsin B antibodies were from Biomol GmbH (Hamburg, Germany); monoclonal anti-β-actin antibodies were from Sigma. All other chemicals were of purest grade commercially available. Expression, Renaturation, and Purification of RNase A Variants-The experimental procedure for expression and renaturation was performed as described previously (22Leich F. Köditz J. Ulbrich-Hofman R. Arnold U. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The proteins were purified on a SOURCE S column (Amersham Biosciences) (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, with a linear gradient of 0–500 mm NaCl). Cells-K-562 cells, which are from a human erythroleukemia cell line, were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing CO2 (5% v/v). Culture medium was RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v), penicillin (100 units ml–1), and streptomycin (100 μgml–1). The cells were grown in T7 cell culture bottles in a volume of 100 ml to densities of 0.5–1 × 106 cells ml–1. Differential Fractionation-Differential fractionation was carried out according to Schröter et al. (30Schröter C.J. Braun M. Englert J. Beck H. Schmid H. Kalbacher H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 227: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. All procedures were carried out at 4 °C or on ice. 10 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 250 mm sucrose was used as fractionation buffer throughout the procedure. About 1 × 109 cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min and washed three times. The cell pellet was resuspended in 0.3 ml of buffer and homogenized by ultrasonic treatment (5 pulses of 5 J) (Vibra Cell; Bioblock Scientific, Lyon). The cell homogenate was then centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 10 min to remove debris, intact cells, plasma membranes, and nuclei (30Schröter C.J. Braun M. Englert J. Beck H. Schmid H. Kalbacher H. J. Immunol. Methods. 1999; 227: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 6 min to isolate mitochondria, endosomes, and lysosomes (fractions E and L) in the pellet. The supernatant was again centrifuged at 130,000 × g for 60 min to remove microsomes (fraction M). The final supernatant contained highly purified cytosol (fraction C). All pellets were washed with fractionation buffer and centrifuged again. The supernatants of the washing steps were discarded. Separation of Endosomes and Lysosomes-Lysosomes were isolated from the combined fractions E and L by a 20-min hypotonic lysis according to Bohley et al. (31Bohley P. Kirschke H. Langner J. Ansorge S. FEBS Lett. 1969; 5: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) using an 18-fold volume of distilled water over the pellet. After another centrifugation step (100,000 × g for 8 min), the content of the lysosomes was in the supernatant (fraction L) whereas mitochondria and endosomes were in the pellet (fraction E). The pellet was washed with fractionation buffer and centrifuged again. The supernatant of the washing step was discarded. Characterization of the Subcellular Fractions-Lysosomes were characterized by the activity of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (β-AGA) determined by a fluorometric assay according to Schmid et al. (32Schmid H. Lindmeier I. Schmitt H. Eissele R. Neuhaus G. Wehrmann M. Renal Physiol. Biochem. 1993; 16: 222-232PubMed Google Scholar). The activity of β-AGA was determined in 95 μl of 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.8 mm 4-methylumbelliferon-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminid and 5 μl of the subcellular fraction. Reactions were incubated in a microtiter plate at 25 °C. Fluorescence emission at 460 nm was followed upon excitation at 360 nm on a POLARstar Galaxy Microplate Reader (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany) for 60 min. The amount of the released product methylumbelliferon was determined from the initial slope using a calibration curve of methylumbelliferon ranging from 10 to 400 μm. For calibration, methylumbelliferon was dissolved (10 mm in 0.5 m sodium glycine buffer, pH 10.4, 0.5 m NaCl) and diluted with 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.02% BSA. In addition, lysosomes were characterized by determination of the total activity of the cathepsins B, L, and S (catBLS). Activity of catBLS was determined fluorometrically (33Schmid H. Koop M. Utermann S. Lambacher L. Mayer P. Schaefer L. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in 95 μlof 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 4 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% BSA, 4 mm EDTA, and 6 μm aprotinin using 0.5 mm benzoyloxycarbonyl-phenylalanyl-arginine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin as substrate and 5 μl of the subcellular fraction. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Activity of catBLS was inhibited by addition of E-64 (final concentration 10 μm) according to Schmid et al. (34Schmid H. Sauerbrei R. Schwarz G. Weber E. Kalbacher H. Driessen C. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1277-1283PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission at 460 nm was determined on a POLARstar Galaxy Microplate Reader upon excitation at 360 nm after diluting the reaction mixtures 200-fold with 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0. 7-Amino-4-methylcoumarin was used for calibration between 2 and 20 μm. The cytosol was characterized by the activity of lactate dehydrogenase according to Storrie and Madden (35Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The activity of lactate dehydrogenase was determined in a mixture of 150 μl of 50 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.5, containing 0.31 mm sodium pyruvate and 5 μl of 8 mm NADH. The reaction was started by addition of 5 μl of subcellular fraction. The decrease of absorbance was followed continuously in a 1 × 0.2-cm cuvette on a UV-visible spectrometer (Ultraspec 3000; Pharmacia Biotech) at 340 nm for 1 min. Lactate dehydrogenase activity was estimated by the use of the extinction coefficient for NADH of 6,300 m–1 cm–1. Immunoblotting-10 ml of K-562 cells (density 0.5–1 × 106 cells ml–1) were incubated for 36 h with 100 μm RNase A entities (100 μm monomeric RNase A variant or 50 μm RNase A tandem enzyme, respectively). As a control, 10 ml of K-562 cells were incubated with phosphate-buffered saline to detect cross-reactivity of the antibodies. After harvesting, extracts of subcellular fractions were prepared and characterized as described above. Additionally, samples of the centrifuged cell homogenate (without debris, intact cells, plasma membranes, and nuclei) were used to quantify the total internalization (T). The same amount of protein for each subcellular fraction (300 ng for total internalization, 60 ng for fraction E, 25 ng for fraction L, and 250 ng for fraction C) was then applied to SDS-PAGE (see below), and proteins were blotted onto an Amersham Biosciences Hybond™-ECL™ nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare) (60 min at 1 mA cm–2). After treatment with milk powder (2.5%, w/v, in Tris-buffered saline, containing 1% v/v Tween), the corresponding parts of the membranes were incubated with polyclonal anti-RNase A (34 μgml–1) and anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase antibodies, with monoclonal anti-β-actin (2 μgml–1) and anti-mouse IgG peroxidase antibodies, or with polyclonal anti-cathepsin B (10 μgml–1) and anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase antibodies. β-actin (43 kDa) was used as internal standard for fractions T and C, and cathepsin B (25 kDa) was used as internal standard for fractions E and L. The ECL system (GE Healthcare) was used for visualization. Quantification was carried out using a GeneGenome (Syngene bioimaging, Cambridge, UK) detection system. Proteolysis-Fractions L and C were prepared as described above. Volumes of fraction C corresponding to 2.67 units ml–1 lactate dehydrogenase activity were used for proteolysis in 10 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 250 mm sucrose and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Volumes of fraction L corresponding to 0.03 units ml–1 catBLS activity were used for proteolysis in 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 2 mm dithiothreitol. The protein concentration of RNases as well as of BSA as control was 0.1 mg ml–1. The reaction was started by addition of the corresponding volume of the cytosolic and the lysosomal fractions. After defined time intervals at 37 °C, samples of 10 μl were withdrawn, mixed immediately with 5 μl of a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete™), dried under nitrogen, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Additionally, in vivo proteolysis was investigated by immunoblot experiments. For each data point, 5 ml of K-562 cells (0.5–1 × 106 cells ml–1) were incubated for 12 to 54 h with 50 μm GP3G-RNase A tandem enzyme. After harvesting, the supernatant of the centrifuged cell homogenate was used to quantify the total internalization and the extent of degradation of the GP3G-RNase A tandem enzyme. The same amount of protein for each sample (100 ng) was applied to SDS-PAGE, and proteins were blotted onto an Amersham Biosciences Hybond™-ECL™ nitrocellulose membrane and visualized as described above. β-actin was used as internal standard. SDS-PAGE and Determination of the Rate Constants of Proteolysis (kp)-Electrophoresis was carried out on a Midget Electrophoresis Unit (Hoefer, San Francisco, CA) according to Laemmli (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) using 5 and 15% (w/v) acrylamide for stacking and separating gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brillant Blue G250. After destaining, the gels were evaluated using a CD 60 densitometer (Desaga, Heidelberg, Germany) at 595 nm. Values of kp were calculated from the decrease in the peak areas of the band of intact protein as a function of time of proteolysis, which followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The determination of kp was performed in triplicate. As RNase A variants differ remarkably in their cytotoxic potency as well as in their capability to evade RI binding, we compared the following variants with respect to cellular uptake and proteolytic stability in order to contribute to the clarification of the contradictory statements on the crucial factors for the cytotoxicity of RNases: RNase A, which is RI-sensitive (Ki = 44 fM) (37Lee F.S. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and non-cytotoxic, G88R-RNase A, which is RI-evasive (Ki = 0.4 nm) (6Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and cytotoxic (IC50 = 7 μm) (6Leland P.A. Schultz L.W. Kim B.M. Raines R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10407-10412Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and the RNase A tandem enzymes with the linker sequences GP3G, GP4G, GP5G, SGSGSG, and SGRSGRSG, which are RI-sensitive but cytotoxic (IC50 = 70, 20, 22, 40, and 13 μm, respectively) (22Leich F. Köditz J. Ulbrich-Hofman R. Arnold U. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 358: 1305-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All RNase A variants are of similar stability and activity. Cell Homogenization and Characterization of the Subcellular Fractions-The harvested cells were homogenized by ultrasonic treatment using 5 pulses of 5 J as more rigorous homogenization conditions increased the portion of destroyed organelles. Subcellular fractions C, E, L, and M obtained by differential fractionation (Fig. 1) as described under “Experimental Procedures” were analyzed for the lysosomal marker enzymes β-AGA and catBLS as well as for the cytosolic marker enzyme lactate dehydrogenase. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the highest activity of the lysosomal marker enzyme was in fraction L (10.9 ± 2.1 units mg–1 corresponding to 78% of the total β-AGA activity). In fraction E, β-AGA activity was 2.2 ± 1.1 units mg–1 whereas the activity of β-AGA in fractions C and M was marginal (0.5 ± 0.2 and 0.4 ± 0.1 units mg–1, respectively). As expected, the highest value of catBLS activity was also found in fraction L with 20.2 ± 3.9 units mg–1; little cathepsin activity was found in endosomes (0.9 ± 0.1 units mg–1). The catBLS activity in fraction C and fraction M was negligible with values of 0.1 ± 0.05 units mg–1 each. In contrast, the cytosolic marker, lactate dehydrogenase activity, was exclusively found in the cytosol (112.9 ± 3.6 units mg–1). These data prove that almost no organelles were disrupted by our cell homogenization method. Proteolysis of RNase A Variants by the Cytosolic and Lysosomal Subcellular Fractions and in Intact K-562 Cells-As internalized RNases face attack by the proteases in the lysosomes as well as in the cytosol, thereby abolishing their catalytic activity, we analyzed the proteolytic susceptibility of the RNase A variants in fractions C and L as well as the proteolytic degradation of an internalized RNase A variant in intact K-562 cells. As exemplified in Fig. 3 for G88R-RNase A and the GP5G-RNase A tandem enzyme, no protein degradation was detectable for all RNase A variants. All these enzymes were stable in the presence of fractions C and L for more than 100 h (Fig. 3). Moreover, the RNase A tandem enzymes were also stable for 54 h in vivo when internalized into intact K-562 cells as shown for the GP3G-RNase A tandem enzyme (Fig. 4). No proteolysis products were detectable by immunoblotting. On the contrary, proteolytic degradation of BSA as a control by fraction C and fraction L was highly reproducible with kp values of (4.0 ± 0.2) × 10–2 h–1 and (3.5 ± 0.3) × 10–2 h–1, respectively.FIGURE 4Immunoblot of the proteolytic degradation of the GP3G-RNase A tandem enzyme. K-562 cells were incubated for 12 h (1), 18 h (2), 24 h (3), 30 h (4), 36 h (5), 42 h (6), 48 h (7), or 54 h (8) with GP3G-RNase A tandem enzyme (50μm). After homogenization and removal of debris, intact cells, and plasma membranes by centrifugation, the totally internalized and proteolytically degraded GP3G-RNase A tandem enzyme (GP3G) as well as β-actin, which was used as internal standard, were detected by immunoblotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Detection of RNase A Variants in the Subcellular Fractions- To quantify the uptake of the RNase A variants into the cells, K-562 cells were incubated in the presence of the respective RNase A variants for 36 h, harvested, and disrupted by ultrasonic treatment. Subcellular fractions were separated by differential fractionation as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Relative amounts of RNase A variants were determined by semiquantitative immunoblotting. As can be seen in Fig. 5, RNase A is clearly detectable only in fraction T. While the GP3G-, GP4G-, GP5G-, and SGSGSG-RNase A tandem enzymes are enriched in this fraction ∼5-fold over RNase A (Fig. 5), the SGRSGRSG-RNase A tandem enzyme, which is the most cytotoxic RNase A tandem enzyme (IC50 = 13 μm"
https://openalex.org/W2035611131,"Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) has been studied extensively, primarily because of its role in the assembly of very low density lipoproteins by the liver and chylomicrons by the intestine. Recent studies have suggested that MTP may also play key roles in other cellular processes. In this paper we report the identification of a novel splice variant of MTP in mice. This isoform, MTP-B, has a unique first exon located ∼2.7 kilobases upstream of canonical MTP (MTP-A) exon 1. The alternative exon encodes 35 amino acids compared with 20 amino acids encoded by exon 1 of MTP-A. MTP-B represents ∼90% of total MTP mRNA in mouse adipocytes and 3T3-L1 cells and <5% in mouse liver and intestine. Expression of the alternate isoform in mouse liver was confirmed by mass spectrometry. Co-transfection of COS cells with truncated forms of apoB and either MTP-A or MTP-B demonstrated that both isoforms are effective in the assembly and secretion of nascent apoB-containing lipoproteins. Confocal microscopy of 3T3-L1 cells transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein or DsRed fusions of the two proteins revealed that MTP-A is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas MTP-B localizes primarily to the Golgi complex in these cells. We conclude that MTP-B functions similarly to MTP-A in lipoprotein assembly. However, in nonlipoprotein-secreting cells, such as the adipocyte, MTP-B may have different localization properties, perhaps reflecting a distinct role in lipid storage and mobilization.

Because some of these tissues do not express apoB, their specialized needs may require MTP for other aspects of lipid trafficking and/or storage. In addition to its role in bulk lipid transport, MTP may also be important in the lipidation of the CD1 family of lipid-antigen-presenting proteins and may, in fact, regulate their function (17Brozovic S. Nagaishi T. Yoshida M. Betz S. Salas A. Chen D. Kaser A. Glickman J. Kuo T. Little A. Morrison J. Corazza N. Kim J.Y. Colgan S.P. Young S.G. Exley M. Blumberg R.S. Nat.

Recently, we reported the presence of MTP in adipocytes of mouse brown and white fat as well as in 3T3-L1 cells and demonstrated triglyceride transfer activity in adipose tissue microsomes (18Swift L.L.

Our confocal microscopy studies demonstrated prominent MTP fluorescence in juxtanuclear areas of undifferentiated 3T3-L1 cells that appeared to parallel individual Golgi cisternae. In contrast, MTP is localized primarily within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in hepatocytes and enterocytes (19Wetterau J.R. Lin M.C.M. Jamil H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1345: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 20Swift L.L. Zhu M.Y. Kakkad B. Jovanovska A. Neely M.D. Valyi-Nagy K. Roberts R.L. Ong D.E. Jerome W.G. J.

Based on this unusual distribution of MTP within the adipocyte, a cell that does not produce apoB or assemble lipoproteins, we hypothesized that adipocyte MTP may be different from MTP found in liver and intestine. In this paper we report the identification of a novel MTP isoform, MTP-B, and demonstrate that this new isoform functions similarly to canonical MTP (MTP-A) in the assembly of nascent apoB-containing lipoproteins. However, our finding that the alternate isoform is the major form of MTP in adipocytes coupled with earlier findings that MTP may be involved in the biogenesis of lipid droplets (18Swift L.L. Kakkad B. Boone C. Jovanovska A. Jerome W.G. Mohler P.J. Ong D.E. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3183-3189Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) suggests that MTP-B may be important in triglyceride metabolism within the fat cell. Animals—C57BL/6 mice (4–8 weeks old) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). The animals were maintained in the Animal Care facility on a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were fed a normal mouse chow diet (RP5015, PMI Feeds Inc., St. Louis, MO). All animal procedures were carried out in accordance with institutional guidelines with approval from the Animal Care Committee at Vanderbilt University. Cell Culture—3T3-L1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm glutamine, 4500 mg/liter glucose, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, and 1500 mg/liter sodium bicarbonate. To maintain cells in a predifferentiated state, they were not allowed to reach confluence. Differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells into adipocytes was initiated by the addition of 10 μm dexamethasone, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, and 10 μg/ml insulin to confluent cells for 2 days. The cells were then cultured in medium containing 10 μg/ml insulin for 2 days after which they were maintained in complete media. The medium was changed every 2 days until differentiation was complete (∼day 8). RNA Preparation—Total tissue or 3T3-L1 cell RNA was prepared using Trizol (Invitrogen) at 1 ml per 100 mg of tissue/cells according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA pellets were dried and dissolved in water. Reverse Transcription-PCR—cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT) priming and the Superscript II reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen) according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. PCR (Advantage II protocol, BD Biosciences, Clontech) was performed using 40–200 ng of cDNA as template and desalted sense and antisense oligonucleotides (Operon Biotechnologies, Inc., Huntsville, AL). Oligonucleotides for full-length cDNA amplification were ATGATCCTCTTGGCAGTGCTTT (MTP-A, sense), ATGACAGTCGTGATGGGGAAATGT (MTP-B, sense), and CCGCTCGAGTCAAAACCATCCACCGGAGTTATC (MTP-A and -B, antisense). Oligonucleotides for analytical PCR, used to screen relative tissue expression of the isoforms were, ATGATCCTCTTGGCAGTGCTTT (MTP-A, sense), ATGACAGTCGTGATGGGGAAATGT (MTP-B, sense), and TCACTACCTACAAGATAGAGGACAG (MTP-A and -B, antisense). Mouse β-actin-specific primers were included in each PCR experiment for normalization (Superscript II PCR, Invitrogen). Quantitative Real-time-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from tissues (liver, intestine, white fat, brown fat) and from 3T3-L1 cells using TRIzol as described above. cDNA was synthesized using a gene-specific primer and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was performed using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) in a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system. Cycling conditions were 95 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C. PCR amplifications were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis to confirm product size. Four serial dilutions of cDNA from each tissue were used to determine linearity and efficiencies of amplification. Standard curves were generated for each isoform using dilutions of a pcDNA vector into which full-length cDNA for either MTP-A or MTP-B had been cloned. The efficiencies of amplification were greater than 95%. The threshold cycles for equivalent concentrations of vectors containing either cDNA differed by an average of 0.18 ± 0.25 cycles (A < B). The relative amount of the mRNA for the two isoforms in each sample was calculated using the 2-ΔΔCT method corrected for the difference in efficiency of the primers. Data were obtained from tissue samples from three to five different mice and are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Identification of Alternate MTP Isoform by Mass Spectrometry—MTP was isolated from mouse liver microsomes by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE. The band, visualized using colloidal Coomassie stain (ProtoBlue Safe, National Diagnostics, Atlanta, GA) was excised and digested with trypsin (21Ham A.L. Encyclopedia of Mass Spectrometry Volume 3: Biological Applications. Part A: Peptides and Proteins.in: Caprioli R.M. Gross M.L. Elsevier, Oxford, UK2005: 10-17Google Scholar). Liquid chromatography-MS-MS analyses were performed using a Thermo Finnigan LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with a Thermo Finnegan Surveyor HPLC pump and autosampler, nanospray source, and Xcalibur 2.0 instrument control and a Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with an Eksigent NanoLC 1D plus HPLC and autosampler as previously described (22Hill K.E.

The full MS data obtained with the LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer were collected at 60,000 resolution, and MS/MS data were collected on the LTQ portion of the instrument similarly to the settings for the LTQ instrument. Some expected masses were targeted to trigger MS/MS spectra throughout the run to verify the initial results. Proteins were identified using the TurboSEQUEST Version 27 (revision 12) algorithm (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA (23Yates J.R. II I Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar)) using the mouse subset of the Uniref 100 data base. Data were also searched for unanticipated modifications using the P-Mod algorithm (24Hansen B.T. Davey S.W. Ham A.J. Liebler D.C. J.

Parks J.S. Weinberg R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44702-44707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mouse MTP-A and MTP-B were cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector. COS cells were cultured as described (26Shelness G.S. Morris-Rogers K.C. Ingram M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9310-9318Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in 100-mm dishes and transiently co-transfected with 3 μg of human apoB34 and 3 μg of human MTP, mouse MTP-A, mouse MTP-B, or human placental alkaline phosphatase (negative control) using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) (27Sellers J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were metabolically radiolabeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys (EasyTag Express protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in Met/Cys-deficient DMEM for 3 h. Cell lysates and media samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-apoB antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography, as described (27Sellers J.A. Shelness G.S. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 1897-1904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flotation and Density Gradient Analysis of Lipoproteins—COS cells in 100-mm dishes were co-transfected with apoB34 (3 μg) and an equivalent mass of human MTP, MTP-A, or MTP-B. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were metabolically radiolabeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys for 4 h. After the addition of protease inhibitors, the medium (1 ml) was subjected to KBr density gradient ultracentrifugation as described (25Shelness G.S. Hou L. Ledford A.S. Parks J.S. Weinberg R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44702-44707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Twelve fractions (1 ml each) were collected, subjected to immunoprecipitation with apoB antibodies, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The mean densities of two blank gradients were determined gravitometrically. Transfection of 3T3-L1 Cells—Full-length MTP-A and MTP-B cDNAs were cloned into pEGFP-N2 and pDsRed-Monomer N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech) using standard molecular techniques. The integrity of the resulting clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing. 3T3-L1 cells were cultured at 20% confluence on 35 mm Mattek plates. One day post-passage, pEGFP-MTP-A and pDsRed-MTP-B plasmids were co-transfected into 3T3-L1 cells in serum-free DMEM using Effectene reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). Twelve hours post-transfection, cells were washed, and serum-containing (10%) DMEM was added. Twenty-four hours later cells were fixed and processed for imaging as described below. Confocal Microscopy—Images were collected and analyzed on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta confocal laser microscope (40-power oil 1.3 NA (Zeiss) or 63-power oil 1.4 NA (Zeiss), pinhole equals 1.0 Airy Disc) using Carl Zeiss Imaging software. Both channels were collected on PMT3 using calibrations to confirm that fluorescence was collected in the linear range. For display, images were converted into TIFF format and processed using Adobe Photoshop software (Version 7.0). Transfection of CHO Cells—CHO cells were plated at ∼20% confluence. Twenty-four hours later they were transfected with the pcDNA3.1 vector expressing full-length MTP-A or -B as described above. Twelve hours post-transfection cells were washed, and serum-containing (10%) DMEM was added. Forty-eight hours later the cells were collected and lysed in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Protein was determined using the bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay, and aliquots were taken for co-immunoprecipitation studies. Co-immunoprecipitation Studies—Co-immunoprecipitations were carried out in deoxycholate buffer (62.5 mm sucrose, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4). Antibody to MTP or PDI (mouse monoclonal IgG2a, Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) was allowed to bind with protein A-agarose (Calbiochem), and the pellets were washed 5 times with ice-cold deoxycholate buffer. Cell lysates (∼200 μg of protein) were added to the antibody/protein A-agarose suspension and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The complexes were recovered by centrifugation, and the pellets were washed 5 times with ice-cold deoxycholate buffer. The immunoprecipitates were solubilized in NuPAGE LDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE Bis-tris gels (4–12% gradients) (Invitrogen), and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) after incubations with appropriate antibodies. Identification of MTP Splice Variant—The published mRNA sequence for mouse Mttp (NM008642) was compared with sequences in the Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) data base (NCBI; blastn), and multiple “hits” were observed across the Mttp mRNA sequence (see Fig. 1, A and B). We identified 28 ESTs that matched the Mttp mRNA sequence; however, only 24 of these were identical to the Mttp 5′ end. The remaining four matches (Fig. 1C) contained a unique 5′ sequence of 85 nucleotides. Comparison of the sequence of these four clones with the intron-exon organization of mouse Mttp revealed that the break in alignment with the published Mttp mRNA sequence was located at the junction between exons 1 and 2. Inspection of mouse genomic sequence revealed that the novel 5′ sequence matched a region of mouse chromosome 3, 2702 bp upstream of Mttp exon 1. These data suggest that the novel 5′ sequence contained within the four similar ESTs may have arisen from transcription initiation at an alternate upstream exon 1. Amplification of Full-length MTP-B cDNA from Mouse Cells and Tissues—Sense strand PCR primers specific for the 5′ ends of either canonical MTP (MTP-A) or the novel MTP (MTP-B) were generated. These were used in combination with a 3′ antisense strand primer common to both forms of MTP mRNA. Full-length MTP-A (∼2.7 kilobases) was amplified from mouse liver, white fat, brown fat, and intestine cDNA (Fig. 2, lanes 2, 8, 10, 12, and 14). MTP-A PCR product was also amplified from undifferentiated or differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 2, lanes 4 and 6). Sequence analysis of the MTP-A-specific PCR reactions revealed 2685 nucleotide products that corresponded to the published mRNA sequence for mouse MTP (NM008642) (data not shown). Using the primer set designed to amplify the unique MTP-B sequence, an abundant PCR product slightly larger than the MTP-A product was generated in all tissues examined (Fig. 2, lanes 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13). Evaluation of the unique 5′ sequence revealed several ATG codons; however, only the upstream ATG was found within the context of a well defined translation initiation consensus sequence (28Kozak M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 197-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). This MTP-B initiator codon is positioned 106 nucleotides upstream from the start of exon 2, compared with 61 nucleotides for canonical MTP-A (Fig. 3). These data together further support the conclusion that the unique 5′ sequence present in MTP-B arises from transcription initiation at an alternative upstream exon (exon 1B), which is spliced directly to exon 2. MTP mRNA sequences derived from exons 2–18 are identical for both the MTP-A and -B isoforms (Fig. 3). As a result of the alternate first exons, the size of the MTP-A and MTP-B mRNAs and proteins are different. Canonical MTP-A encodes an 894-amino acid protein, with the first 20 amino acids encoded by canonical exon 1 (exon 1A) (Fig. 3). Of these 20 amino acids, the first 18 are predicted to comprise the signal sequence (29Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5622) Google Scholar, 30Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar). Hence, the resulting N-terminal residues of mature MTP-A are VK. The new MTP (MTP-B) is predicted to be 909 amino acids, 35 of which are encoded by the alternate first exon (exon 1B) (Fig. 3). Employing neural network prediction models, as implemented by SignalP 3.0 (29Bendtsen J.D. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Brunak S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 783-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (5622) Google Scholar, 30Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4923) Google Scholar), a cleavage site between residues 31–32 is predicted with high probability and two lower probability sites between residues 30–31 and 32–33. These processing events would leave three-five novel residues at the mature N terminus of MTP-B, as depicted in Fig. 3. Tissue Expression of MTP-A and MTP-B mRNA—Reverse Transcription-PCR was used to probe the expression profiles of MTP-A and MTP-B in mouse tissues and 3T3-L1 cells. For both MTP-A and MTP-B, an antisense oligonucleotide was generated ∼600 nucleotides downstream of the exon 1/exon 2 junction. MTP-A- and MTP-B-specific sense oligonucleotides were designed with similar GC content, melting temperatures, and ΔG (6.0 kcal/mol). Mouse β-actin primers, generating a ∼500-bp product, were included as a reference control. PCR products for both isoforms were generated in all tissues examined as well as in 3T3-L1 cells (Fig. 4A). Real-time PCR was used to quantitate the relative expression levels of the two isoforms. In liver, jejunum, and ileum, MTP-A PCR product represented >97% of the total (Fig. 4B). In contrast, in white and brown fat as well as in 3T3-L1 cells, MTP-B predominated, composing at least 90% of the total PCR product. Mass Spectrometric Identification of MTP-B—Liquid chromatography-MS analysis of the digest of the MTP band confirmed the presence of MTP. Approximately 46% of the entire sequence was identified after filtering the Sequest data for confidently identified peptides. Additional analysis of the data with the P-Mod algorithm (24Hansen B.T. Davey S.W. Ham A.J. Liebler D.C. J. Proteome Res. 2005; 4: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) revealed a match to a doubly charged peptide, QNSGHTTGLSLNNER, with a mass shift of approximately -17 Da (Fig. 5A). Peptides containing an N-terminal glutamine can cyclize and lose NH3 to form a pyroglutamate moiety (31Tabb D.L. Friedman D.B. Ham A.J. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2213-2222Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), consistent with this MS/MS spectrum. Additional confirmatory evidence for the identity of this peptide was obtained using the LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer which showed that the peptide was doubly charged and within 2.2 ppm of the predicted mass (Fig. 5B). This peptide could only arise from the B isoform of MTP (Fig. 3). In addition, it would not likely be formed by trypsin digestion (which cleaves at arginines and lysines), supporting its identification as the N-terminal peptide of mature MTP-B. Functional Properties of MTP-A and MTP-B—Studies in our laboratory have demonstrated abundant triglyceride transfer activity in lysates from 3T3-L1 cells, which predominantly express MTP-B (Fig. 4). To explore further the functional properties of the MTP-B isoform, COS cells were co-transfected with human apoB34 and either human MTP, mouse MTP-A, or mouse MTP-B followed by metabolic radiolabeling with [35S]Met/Cys and immunoprecipitation (25Shelness G.S. Hou L. Ledford A.S. Parks J.S. Weinberg R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 44702-44707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). As observed in Fig. 6A, cotransfection of apoB34 with the control plasmid, alkaline phosphatase (AP), resulted in abundant apoB34 synthesis (lane 1) but undetectable secretion (lane 2). Cotransfection with human MTP and the mouse MTP isoforms revealed that each was capable of inducing apoB34 secretion to a similar extent (compare lanes 4, 6, and 8). However, immunoblot analysis o"

Serpin metastability drives both a large conformational change that is utilized during proteinase inhibition and confers an inherent structural flexibility that renders serpins susceptible to aggregation under certain conditions. These include point mutations (the basis of a number of important human genetic diseases), small changes in pH, and an increase in temperature. Many studies of serpins from mesophilic organisms have highlighted an inverse relationship: mutations that confer a marked increase in serpin stability compromise inhibitory activity. Here we present the first biophysical characterization of a metastable serpin from a hyperthermophilic organism. Aeropin, from the archaeon Pyrobaculum aerophilum, is both highly stable and an efficient proteinase inhibitor. We also demonstrate that because of high kinetic barriers, aeropin does not readily form the partially unfolded precursor to serpin aggregation. We conclude that stability and activity are not mutually exclusive properties in the context of the serpin fold, and propose that the increased stability of aeropin is caused by an unfolding pathway that minimizes the formation of an aggregation-prone intermediate ensemble, thereby enabling aeropin to bypass the misfolding fate observed with other serpins.

They, therefore, represent an exception to the Anfinsen rule that all proteins fold to their most energetically preferred state (4Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar). Other metastable proteins include influenza hemagglutinin (5Bullough P.A. Hughson F.M. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1994; 371: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar) and α-lytic protease (6Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). All these proteins use their metastability as a source of stored potential energy that is expended to perform their biological function. serine proteinase inhibitor reactive center loop guanidine hydrochloride nitrilotriacetic acid archetypal serpin antitrypsin serine proteinase inhibitor reactive center loop guanidine hydrochloride nitrilotriacetic acid archetypal serpin antitrypsin For serpins, the metastable native state possesses an intrinsic structural flexibility, which permits a rapid conformational change that is required for proteinase inhibition. The propensity to undergo conformational change is supported by a highly conserved tertiary architecture, which consists of three β-sheets (A to C) surrounded by 9 α-helices (hA–hI) and a solvent-exposed reactive center loop (RCL), which determines inhibitory specificity (Fig. 1). During proteinase inhibition, the RCL is cleaved by the proteinase and becomes incorporated as a middle strand of the A-sheet, a process referred to as the stressed → relaxed (S to R) transition. As a result, the proteinase is translocated to the opposite pole of the serpin, and the two are trapped in a highly stable, covalent serpin-enzyme complex (7Huntington J.A. Read R.J. Carrell R.W. Nature. 2000; 407: 923-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). The serpin thus surrenders its metastability in favor of adopting a more stable conformation that complements proteinase inhibition. The energetic basis of this inhibitory mechanism is that incorporation of the RCL as a strand into the A-sheet is thermodynamically favorable (8Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, serpins can also adopt another thermodynamically favorable state by inserting their RCL into an adjacent serpin molecule. Propagation of the resulting loop-sheet linkages results in the formation of long-chain A-sheet polymers (9Mast A.E. Enghild J.J. Salvesen G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2720-2728Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 10Bottomley S.P. Hopkins P.C. Whisstock J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biol. 1999; 293: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Loop A-sheet polymers occur when the serpin native state is perturbed by mutation or small changes in pH and temperature. Such perturbation results in the partial unfolding of the serpin and the formation of a nonnative ensemble of structures, which then readily self-associate (13James E.L. Bottomley S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 14Cabrita L.D. Dai W. Bottomley S.P.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 2642-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It has been shown that by increasing the stability of this intermediate ensemble or the rate of its formation, the likelihood of polymerization occurring is also significantly increased (16Yu M.H. Lee K.N. Kim J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Physiologically, this is manifested in a range of loss-of-function diseases such as emphysema, liver cirrhosis, thrombosis, and dementia (17Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). An understanding of the determinants of metastability in serpins thus has relevance to important human pathologies. Extensive biochemical and biophysical studies have demonstrated that residues important to maintaining and controlling metastability are distributed throughout the molecule (18Seo E.J. Im H. Maeng J.S. Kim K.E. Yu M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16904-16909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 19Lee C. Park S.H. Lee M.Y. Yu M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 2003; 325: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Stabilizing mutations produce more diverse effects: some only moderately enhance stability and retain serpin function (19Lee C.

Mol. Biol. 2003; 325: 581-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), while others yield increased stability at the expense of inhibition, presumably because the flexibility that is required for inhibition is no longer present (22Im H. Ryu M.J. Yu M.H. Protein Eng. Des. Sel. 2004; 17: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These studies, which have been restricted to serpins from mesophilic organisms, highlight a serpin metastability paradigm that reflects an exquisite balance between structural stability and flexibility to achieve biological function. This structure/function compromise seemingly precludes the possibility of an active serpin with a greatly increased native state stability. However, this position is at odds with the presence of serpin sequences in the genomes of several moderate to highly thermophilic bacteria and archaea (23Irving J.A. Steenbakkers P.J. Lesk A.M.

This article reports the first characterization of a serpin from a hyperthermophilic organism: the crenarchaeon, Pyrobaculum aerophilum, which thrives in deep thermal vents at temperatures exceeding 100 °C (23Irving J.A.

We demonstrate that this serpin, aeropin, possesses a remarkable resistance to chemical and thermal denaturation with respect to all other characterized serpins, while paradoxically remaining an effective proteinase inhibitor. More intriguingly, the data reveal a potential mechanism by which aeropin and other hyperthermophilic proteins are able to avoid aggregation. Cloning, Expression, and Purification—Genomic DNA was extracted from P. aerophilum (DSMZ). The following sense and antisense oligonucleotides were used to amplify the aeropin gene (GenBank™ ID 1464742):(5′–3′) ctaattggatccttgcggcccctcccgagc and (5′–3′) gcccgggtcgacttaagtcggcgtaaagcc. The PCR fragment was cloned into pRSETC (Invitrogen). Mutations, created using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), were introduced to remove the disulfide bonds. The presence of the mutations was verified with DNA sequencing. The following oligonucleotide sequences were used to introduce the mutations, the mutation is underlined.

For expression and purification, the expression vectors containing aeropin and the disulfide mutants were transformed into Rosetta-Gami pLysS Escherichia coli (Novagen). Expression of aeropin and the disulfide mutants was induced at an A600 nm of ∼0.6 and continued for 5 h at 37 °C. The protein was purified using both Ni-NTA affinity and size exclusion (Superdex 200 16/60) chromatography. It was found that the concentration of NaCl had to be maintained at 200 mm to ensure the protein remained soluble, a characteristic that has been seen for other proteins derived from P. aerophilum (29Toth E.A.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14484-14492Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The most pure fractions as determined by SDS-PAGE were concentrated and stored at –80 °C. Cleaved aeropin was prepared as previously described except following digestion, the protein was incubated at 100 °C for 60 min to remove residual uncleaved material (24Irving J.A. Cabrita L.D. Rossjohn J. Pike R.N. Bottomley S.P. Whisstock J.C. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Enzyme Kinetics—All kinetic measurements were performed in 50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) PEG 8000, pH 7.8 as previously described (31Djie M.Z. Le Bonniec B.F. Hopkins P.C. Hipler K. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11461-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Spectroscopic Methods—Stock solutions of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) were prepared in 20 mm NaPO4, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.8, and the concentration was confirmed using refractive index measurements (32Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). Equilibrium unfolding and refolding curves were performed as previously described (33James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Heat-induced Polymerization—Polymerization was followed using non-denaturing PAGE analysis (13James E.L. Bottomley S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The protein was at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml in 20 mm NaPO4, 200 mm NaCl pH 7.8 for 15 min and analyzed between 20 and 100 °C. Size-exclusion Chromatography Analysis—Samples of aeropin at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml were incubated in 0–6 m GdnHCl overnight. The samples were then separated using a Superose 12 10/30 column in 20 mm NaPO4, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.8. Aeropin Is a Serine Proteinase Inhibitor—The aeropin (Gen-Bank™ ID 1464742) gene was cloned into an E. coli expression system, and the protein expressed and purified to homogeneity with its integrity confirmed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Sequence alignment of aeropin with other serpins (Fig. 1B) demonstrates that it possesses most of the highly conserved residues of the serpin superfamily (34Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome. Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), suggesting that it conforms to the common serpin structure, as shown in the molecular model in Fig. 1A. Aeropin most likely lacks the D-helix, an element also absent from the structure of crmA (35Renatus M. Zhou Q. Stennicke H.R. Snipas S.J. Turk D. Bankston L.A. Liddington R.C. Salvesen G.S. Structure Fold Des. 2000; 8: 789-797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (53) Google Scholar), based on a significantly truncated region containing two proline residues. The sequence alignment also indicates that aeropin is likely to be a proteinase inhibitor due to the presence of an inhibitory hinge motif (23Irving J.A. Steenbakkers P.J. Lesk A.M. Op den Camp H.J. Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The primary determinant of the inhibitory specificity of a serpin is typically a dipeptide sequence around 14 residues C-terminal to the hinge region motif (36Hopkins P.C. Carrell R.W. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7650-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), known as the P1-P1′ site (37Schechter I. Berger A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 27: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (4697) Google Scholar). However, the cognate proteinase inhibited by aeropin is not known, and the aeropin P1-P1′ residues (V-C) did not immediately propose a model target proteinase. Subsequently, aeropin was found to be a potent chymotrypsin inhibitor with a stoichiometry of inhibition of 1.2 molecules of inhibitor required to inhibit 1 molecule of proteinase at 37 °C (Fig. 2 and Table 1). SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions confirmed that the proteinase and inhibitor were locked in a covalent inhibitory complex (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, the association rate constant (kassoc) at 37 °C was found to be 1.8 × 105 m–1 s–1 (Table 1). Cumulatively, these data indicate that aeropin is a highly efficient proteinase inhibitor, that employs the serpin mechanism of inhibition, and hence aeropin is capable of undergoing the S → R transition.TABLE 1Inhibitory and stability characteristics of aeropin and its variantsSIkappkassocTm (in 3.5 m GdnHCl)m-1 s-1m-1 s-1°CAeropin1.2 ± 0.11.5 × 105 ± 0.21.8 × 10565 ± 0.5ΔCysRCL>200NDaND, not determined.—61 ± 0.5ΔCysAE1.2 ± 0.11.0 × 105 ± 0.21.2 × 10556 ± 0.5ΔCys>200ND—55 ± 0.5a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Aeropin Is Thermostable—The thermal stability of aeropin was measured by observing changes in secondary structure using far-UV circular dichroism (CD), during an increase in temperature. Aeropin, in non-denaturing buffer, showed no appreciable change in signal over the entire temperature range (Fig. 3A), which suggested that its melting temperature (Tm) exceeds 95 °C. The thermal melt was repeated in the presence of 3.5 m GdnHCl, which was shown in preliminary experiments to preserve the native conformation of aeropin. The presence of denaturant resulted in an observable thermal unfolding transition from the baseline, with a Tm of 65 °C (Fig. 3A and Table 1). It is interesting to note that under the same denaturing conditions the archetypal serpin antitrypsin (α1-AT), used as a benchmark for comparison throughout this study, is >80% unfolded (33James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that aeropin possesses a markedly enhanced thermostability with respect to all other inhibitory serpins studied to date. A hallmark of serpin metastability is the transition to a more stable state upon proteolytic cleavage of the RCL. To determine whether aeropin was indeed metastable, the thermal stability of the chymotrypsin-cleaved form of aeropin was analyzed. As can be seen in Fig. 3A, in the presence of 3.5 m GdnHCl cleaved aeropin does not unfold even at temperatures in excess of 90 °C, indicating that RCL cleavage leads to an increase in stability. The thermostability profile of aeropin was also monitored using non-denaturing PAGE analysis (Fig. 3B). Consistent with the thermal melt data, aeropin remained monomeric until >90 °C after which there was a disappearance of aeropin protein from the running gel. Such a disappearance presumably reflects aggregation and not polymerization as no laddering consistent with serpin polymerization was observed. This characteristic has been seen previously with other serpins (38Chang W.S. Whisstock J. Hopkins P.C. Lesk A.M. Carrell R.W. Wardell M.R. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 89-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Aeropin Is Resistant to Changes in pH—We next determined whether the high stability of aeropin was maintained over a broad pH range. Thermal denaturation, monitored by far-UV CD, was undertaken at different pH values were carried out, and the midpoint of denaturation determined for both aeropin and α1-AT (Table 2). Aeropin proved to be remarkably stable to changes in pH and did not display an unfolding transition until the pH was lowered to around 4. In contrast α1-AT displayed a decreased Tm value below pH 6 and was completely unfolded at pH 3.5 (39Devlin G.L. Chow M.K. Howlett G.J. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).TABLE 2The effect of pH upon aeropin stabilitypHAeropin TmAntitrypsin Tm°C°C3.581Unfolded4.093395.0>95576.0>95647.0>95628.0>9559 Open table in a new tab Equilibrium Unfolding—Unfolding studies of aeropin were conducted using both far-UV CD and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Refolding was also attempted; however, in common with many other serpins aeropin did not refold to 100% active material. As a result, a full thermodynamic analysis could not be performed on the data; hence, transition midpoints on the unfolding curve were used as the measure of protein stability. No significant change in the secondary structure occurred below 3.5 m GdnHCl, at which point a single transition occurred with a midpoint of 4.3 m GdnHCl, and complete unfolding was observed in 6.5 m GdnHCl (Fig. 4A). The unfolding failed to reveal the plateau region, associated with a highly populated intermediate ensemble, that is characteristic of all other serpins studied to date (24Irving J.A. Cabrita L.D.

Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was also used to monitor unfolding. As observed with far-UV CD, the unfolding of aeropin showed a native baseline to 3.5 m GdnHCl (Fig. 4B) after which there was a single highly co-operative transition to the unfolded state centered around a midpoint of 4.0 m GdnHCl. While individually the fluorescence and CD unfolding curves suggest a two-state unfolding mechanism, the observation that they are not super-imposable indicates that aeropin follows a three-state model with an unfolding intermediate. The presence of an unfolding intermediate has been previously characterized in several serpins by their ability to bind the hydrophobic dye, bis-ANS (33James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 42Pearce M.C. Rubin H. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28513-28518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To test whether the intermediate ensemble adopted by aeropin possessed such a property, we incubated denatured aeropin in the presence of bis-ANS, and recorded the resulting spectra. However, there was no detectable change in the fluorescence signal (data not shown), indicating that the intermediate ensemble possesses different characteristics to intermediates previously studied. Equilibrium Unfolding Monitored by Size-exclusion Chromatography—It has been previously reported that incubation at high protein concentration and low denaturant concentrations causes α1-AT to polymerize (45Lomas D.A. Evans D.L. Stone S.R. Chang W.S. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 500-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To assess whether aeropin was subject to aggregation during the unfolding process, aeropin (0.2 mg/ml) was incubated in increasing GdnHCl concentrations and separated using size-exclusion chromatography. Between 0 and 2 m GdnHCl, a single elution peak centered at ∼13.6 ml was observed (Fig. 4C). By 4 m GdnHCl, there was a heterogeneous population of both unfolded (∼10 ml) and folded material (13 ml), and there was also a small shoulder centered on 11 ml. The appearance of the shoulder coincided with the concentration of denaturant identified in the spectroscopic studies to produce an intermediate species. Upon incubation in 6 m GdnHCl, aeropin became fully unfolded, with an elution peak at 9.5 ml. Preliminary studies showed that polymeric serpins elute at 7.7 ml, and thus it is clear that no polymeric aeropin was present during unfolding (data not shown) despite prolonged incubations of up to 2 days. Kinetics of Aeropin Unfolding—As partial unfolding of the native serpin state is the first step in polymerization (13James E.L. Bottomley S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 46Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), we determined the unfolding rate of aeropin using tryptophan fluorescence. Fig. 5 is a representation of the unfolding of aeropin in 6 m GdnHCl. It is clear that aeropin unfolds over a very long timescale (order of minutes) and a kinetic analysis indicates the presence of two kinetic phases. A kinetic unfolding profile for aeropin over a range of denaturant concentrations was determined and the two rates of unfolding (in water) were calculated by extrapolation as previously described (32Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). The N → I rate was found to be 2.41 × 10–9 s–1, while the I→ U transition was ∼200-fold faster at 4.31 × 10–7 s–1. These rates were found to be concentration-independent, indicating that aggregation was not occurring during the unfolding reaction. Investigating the Role of the Disulfides in the High Stability of Aeropin—Our current data have shown that aeropin has both high stability and inhibitory activity. To identify a possible structural basis for this property, an initial homology model of aeropin was constructed based on the structure with the highest sequence identity (31%) antithrombin (23Irving J.A. Steenbakkers P.J. Lesk A.M. Op den Camp H.J. Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As noted previously the model suggested the possible presence of two disulfide bonds that could play a significant role in both its activity and stability (Fig. 1A) (23Irving J.A. Steenbakkers P.J. Lesk A.M. Op den Camp H.J. Pike R.N. Whisstock J.C. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2002; 19: 1881-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Using antitrypsin numbering, these cysteines are Cys102, Cys136, Cys224, and Cys359. We predicted that the Cys102–Cys136 pair would form a disulfide between the E-helix and the region preceding s2A, while Cys224–Cys359 would form a disulfide between the C sheet and the P1′ of the RCL. When aeropin is analyzed by SDS-PAGE in the absence and presence of dithiothreitol, there is a significant band shift indicating the presence of disulfide bonds which restrict the SDS-induced unfolding of aeropin (Fig. 6). The presence of two bonds was confirmed first by sulfhydral titration using the Ellman assay (47Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 74: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar) in which aeropin was reacted with DNTB, and the release of the NTB anion was followed spectrophotometrically. In a non-reducing environment, there was no appreciable change in absorbance, indicating an absence of free thiols. When aeropin was incubated under reducing conditions, a concentration of 4 thiols per aeropin molecule was determined, indicating that there are 2 disulfide bonds present in the native molecule. Three mutants were constructed in which the cysteines were replaced with serines to probe the role of the disulfides in aeropin stability and inhibitory properties. ΔCysRCL represents the variant with substitutions at positions Cys224 and Cys359, ΔCysAE has substitutions at Cys102 and Cys136, and ΔCys has all the cysteines replaced by serine (Fig. 6). The absence of free thiols in the double mutants determined using the titration assay detailed above, confirmed the disulfide bond pattern predicted from the homology model. The inhibitory activity of the variants was tested against chymotrypsin. As shown in Table 1, the inhibitory activity of both ΔCysRCL and ΔCys was significantly compromised with SI values in excess of 200, whereas ΔCysAE, had an SI identical to the wild-type protein (SI = 1.2). The thermostability of the disulfide variants was assessed using far-UV CD (in the presence of 3.5 m GdnHCl). ΔCys and ΔCysAE were found to have the greatest difference in stability relative to wild-type, with Tm values of 55 °C and 56 °C, respectively (Table 1), while ΔCysRCL had a Tm of 61 °C, which is comparable to wild-type. Cumulatively, these data suggest that loss of the disulfide at the RCL makes little difference to the stability of the molecule, and contrasts with the loss at s2A-E which results in a large destabilization. Native-PAGE analysis of the effects of heat upon the disulfide variants of aeropin reported a similar finding (Fig. 6). There was a disappearance of the monomer band at temperatures above 80 °C for both the ΔCysAE and ΔCys variants, while the ΔCysRCL mutant was stable to temperatures beyond 90 °C (Fig. 6). In addition, no laddering was observed consistent which is consistent with a lack of serpin polymerization. While there were differences between the stability of the variants, in all, they appeared to have retained a remarkable resistance to thermal denaturation. This report presents the first biophysical characterization of a serpin from an extremophile. Aeropin was found to be metastable and an active, efficient proteinase inhibitor, consistent with the serpin mechanism of function. Moreover, it possesses a remarkable tolerance to both chemical and thermal denaturation, and did not polymerize in either low denaturant concentrations, with heating or changes in pH as observed with other serpins (13James E.L.

Partial unfolding of α1-AT and other serpins has been shown to be a critical first step toward aggregation (13James E.L. Bottomley S.P. Arch. Biochem.

All of the serpins studied to date unfold via a three-state mechanism, which involves the adoption of an intermediate ensemble (24Irving J.A. Cabrita L.D. Rossjohn J. Pike R.N. Bottomley S.P.

The intermediate ensemble of α1-AT for example, possesses a molten globule-like structure with a partially opened A-sheet and disrupted F-helix (33James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9482-9488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 50Tew D.J. Bottomley S.P. J. Mol.

Under appropriate conditions, this ensemble is the key polymerogenic precursor. In α1-AT deficiency the three most common disease variants Z, Siiyama, and Mmalton involve single point mutations that cause stabilization of this intermediate species and subsequent polymerization at physiological temperatures (16Yu M.H. Lee K.N. Kim J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). How does aeropin avoid the unfolding trap that leads to polymerization and aggregation? The data presented here suggest two reasons: (1Huber R. Carrell R.W. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8951-8966Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) the intermediate ensemble is different in character to the polymerogenic form observed with mesophilic serpins; and (2Cabrita L.D. Bottomley S.P. Eur. Biophys. J. 2004; 33: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) aeropin has evolved a kinetic mechanism to minimize the population of its unfolding intermediate. We have shown that aeropin follows a three-state unfolding profile, however, unlike the intermediate of α1-AT and other serpins (13James E.L. Bottomley S.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 33James E.L. Whisstock J.C. Gore M.G. Bottomley S.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 48644-48650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the aeropin intermediate ensemble was unable to bind bis-ANS and did not show a 20% loss in secondary structure, suggesting that it is in a different conformation. In addition to the altered intermediate conformation aeropin displays a high kinetic stability with a transition half-life (N → I) of ∼80,000 h, that separates the aeropin native state and its intermediate ensemble. The equivalent N → I phase for α1-AT is difficult to measure because of its speed; however, the presence of 0.4 m sodium sulfate increases its half-life to 0.92 s. 7L. D. Cabrita and S. P. Bottomley, unpublished observations. A stabilized native state significantly decreases the likelihood of partial unfolding and therefore aggregation. This is consistent with experimental studies on the effects of the stabilizing F51L mutation on the Z variant of α1-AT, which rescued the folding defect from Z α1-AT by decreasing the rate of unfolding (54Kim J. Lee K.N. Yi G.S. Yu M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8597-8601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Other proteins achieve a modified intermediate ensemble through modification of the stability of the native state. For example, in thymidylate synthase, a single point mutation stabilized the native structure and resulted in the accumulation of the intermediate over a narrower denaturant concentration range than the wild-type protein. The implication was that the protein was less likely to aggregate (55Prasanna V. Gopal B. Murthy M.R. Santi D.V. Balaram P. Proteins. 1999; 34: 356-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Similarly, stabilization of the native structure of ricin resulted in the loss of its aggregation-prone intermediate (56McHugh C.A. Tammariello R.F. Millard C.B. Carra J.H. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 2736-2743Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, suppressor mutations have also been demonstrated to destabilise the aggregation-prone intermediate in a tail spike protein (57Mitraki A. Fane B. Haase-Pettingell C. Sturtevant J. King J. Science. 1991; 253: 54-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 58Fane B. Villafane R. Mitraki A. King J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11640-11648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). While fine details underlying the stability of the aeropin native state await an experimental structure, the biophysical confirmation of the presence of two disulfide bonds suggested these as likely stabilizing factors against unfolding and polymerization. Indeed, this was found to be the case for the covalent linkage between helix E and the region preceding strand 2A. However, removal of this linking yielded a mutant that remained relatively stable. Remarkably, removal of the disulfide between the C-sheet and the RCL did not significantly affect thermal stability. Hence, other stabilizing factors must be present. A sequence comparison with ten mesophilic serpins (listed in Fig. 1B) revealed that aeropin has a lower proportion of uncharged polar residues, and hence a higher ratio of charged to uncharged polar side chains (1.43), than the mesophilic counterparts (1.07 ± 0.12). This has been noted for other thermophilic proteins (59Suhre K. Claverie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17198-17202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and may enhance stability through the formation of salt bridges (60Chakravarty S. Varadarajan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8152-8161Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 61Greaves R. Warwicker J. BMC Struct. Biol. 2007; 7: 18Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Aeropin also shows a significantly higher number of glycine, alanine, and valine side chains (p < 0.01). Interestingly, aeropin also contains significantly more tyrosine residues than the mesophilic serpins, many of which are predicted from the model to be predominantly surface-inaccessible; the ability of these residues to simultaneously form hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic and cation-pi interactions may further stabilize the protein. The metastability paradigm describes a delicate balance between structural flexibility and inhibitory activity, where the maintenance of the former property is vital for effective inhibition. Aeropin highlights that it is possible for a serpin to adopt a high native state stability and an atypical intermediate. As a result, conformational changes required for biological activity are retained while unfolding events that may promote misfolding are less likely to occur. Presumably, the degree of native state stability consistent with serpin inhibitory activity stability depends on temperature, and in the case of an organism existing in extreme heated environments, compensating changes to the polymerogenic intermediate have also been necessary. This may thus explain the intolerance that many mesophilic serpins have shown to an increase in stability. Moreover, as aeropin retains an unfolding profile that in character, if not degree, is seen with other serpins, it has reinforced the importance of the intermediate ensemble and the relationship between unfolding, stability, and activity."
https://openalex.org/W2011219771,"Cancer cells escape apoptosis by intrinsic or acquired mechanisms of drug resistance. An alternative strategy to circumvent resistance to apoptosis could be through redirection into other death pathways, such as necrosis. However, necrosis is a nonspecific, nontargeted process resulting in cell lysis and inflammation of both cancer and normal cells and is therefore not a viable alternative. Here, we report that a C-terminal peptide of p53, called p53p-Ant, induced targeted necrosis only in multiple mutant p53 human prostate cancer lines and not normal cells, because the mechanism of cytotoxicity by p53p-Ant is dependent on the presence of high levels of mutant p53. Topotecan- and paclitaxel-resistant prostate cancer lines were as sensitive to p53p-Ant-induced targeted necrosis as parental lines. A massive loss of ATP pools and intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species was involved in the mechanism of targeted necrosis, which was inhibited by (O2·¯) scavengers. We hypothesize that targeted necrosis by p53p-Ant is dependent on mutant p53, is mediated by (O2·¯) loss and ATP, and can circumvent chemotherapy resistance to apoptosis.

The currently accepted paradigm is that most anticancer agents, at clinically relevant concentrations, act by inducing cell death in cancer cells via pathways of apoptosis. Therefore, anticancer agents are developed to maximize apoptosis. However, cancer cells eventually become resistant to therapeutic agents that induce caspase-dependent apoptosis. There are multiple specific mechanisms that may contribute to resistance to apoptosis not only in prostate cancer cells but virtually all cancer cells, which include changes in Bcl-2 (1Raffo A.J. Perlman H. Chen M.W. Day M.L. Streitman J.S. Buttyan R. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4438-4445PubMed Google Scholar), p53 (2Isaacs W.B. Carter B.S. Ewing C.M.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7861-7871Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Therefore, disabling just one of the prior mechanisms of resistance may not render sensitivity to cancer cells, because of the multiple, redundant anti-apoptotic mechanisms that exist concomitantly within cancer cells (7Howell S.B. Mol. Urol. 2000; 4: 225-231PubMed Google Scholar). In the search for more effective therapies, possible avenues to examine are alternate death pathways, which bypass resistance mechanisms of apoptosis. Necrosis is one alternate pathway, with fewer mechanisms of resistance compared with apoptosis. But because it is a nonspecific process resulting in cell lysis and inflammation of cancer and normal cells, necrosis has not generally been considered a viable alternative to apoptosis. However, it maybe possible to exploit necrosis, specifically against cancer cells, by induction of what we termed “targeted necrosis” (8Do T.N. Rosal R.V. Drew L. Raffo A.J. Michl J. Pincus M.R. Friedman F.K. Petrylak D.P. Cassai N. Szmulewicz J. Sidhu G. Fine R.L. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 1431-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Targeted necrosis has potential clinical utility, because its cell death mechanism retains the cancer cell specificity of apoptosis and bypasses apoptotic resistance by redirection into necrosis. The molecular mechanisms of necrosis have not been well defined, but it can occur as a result of an incomplete execution of apoptosis (9Formigli L. Papucci L. Tani A. Schiavone N. Tempestini A. Orlandini G.E. Capaccioli S. Orlandini S.Z. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Necrosis and apoptosis share some common pathway elements (10Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar), and often the same stimulus can direct a cell into either mode of death (11Bonfoco E. Krainc D. Ankarcrona M. Nicotera P. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7162-7166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). Apoptosis requires energy through ATP, whereas necrosis is an ATP-independent mechanism of cell death. Therefore, one primary factor that determines whether a cell follows an apoptotic or necrotic pathway is the intracellular concentration of ATP (9Formigli L. Papucci L. Tani A. Schiavone N.

This peptide induced classical apoptosis in several colon and breast carcinoma and Burkitt's lymphoma lines with mutant p53 (15Selivanova G. Iotsova V. Okan I. Fritsche M. Strom M. Groner B.

Thus, the ability of the peptide for induction of apoptosis was directly correlated to levels of endogenous p53. We found that the binding target site of the peptide was at the tetramerization domain of p53 (18Li Y. Mao Y. Rosal R.V. Dinnen R.D. Williams A.C. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Fine R.L. Int. J.

Further studies in our lab with peptide and purified wt and mutant p53 in surface plasmon resonance (Biacore) studies revealed potent dissociation constants (Kd = ∼10–12 m) for mutant p53, whereas the Kd for wt p53 was weaker (∼10–10 m). This may explain why p53p-Ant was not toxic to null p53 cells, normal cells, and CD34+ pluripotent marrow stem cells, which have either no p53 or low levels of wt p53 (18Li Y. Mao Y. Rosal R.V.

In this paper we report that p53p-Ant, when exposed to hormone-refractory, mutant p53 prostate cancer cell lines, induced primarily necrosis with some aborted features of apoptosis (9Formigli L.

Our hypothesis is that the mechanism of targeted necrosis is specific for mutant p53 prostate tumor cells and can overcome resistance to apoptosis by redirection to a necrotic pathway whose mechanism depends on the generation and toxic effects of superoxide (O2·¯) Materials—C-terminal p53 peptide (aa 361–382) (p53p), Ant, p53p-Ant, and p53p truncated control (aa 372–379) (p53-AntCONT) peptides were chemically synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) and high pressure liquid chromatography-purified to more than 95% pure as previously described (17Kim A.L.

The human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines PC-3 (null p53), DU-145 (mutant p53, Leu-223 and Phe-274), 22Rv1 (mutant p53, Arg-331), VCaP (mutant p53, Trp-248), and LNCaP (wt p53) were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The stably transfected, temperature-sensitive mutant p53 PC-3 cell line was made in our lab as described below under “Plasmids and Stable Transfection.” P69 immortalized normal prostate cells were generously supplied by Dr. Paul Fisher (Columbia University). P69 cells were allowed to adhere to cell culture dishes for up to4hin RPMI medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 ng/ml gentamycine (Invitrogen), 0.1 μm dexamethasone, and ITS premix (BD Biosciences). The medium was then changed to RPMI containing 2 mm glutamine, 50 μg/ml gentamycine, 0.1 μm dexamethasone, ITS premix, and 1 μg/liter EGF (BD Biosciences). DURC-1 cells were generously supplied by Dr. Panayotis Pantazis (University of Miami). The DURC-1 cell line were parental DU-145 cells made resistant to camptothecin (CPT-11) and topotecan (19Urasaki Y. Laco G.S. Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Kohlhagen G. Gioffre C. Zhang H. Chatterjee D. Pantazis P. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1964-1969PubMed Google Scholar). Paclitaxel (PAC)-resistant DU-145 (DU-Tax-R) cells were generated in our lab by increasing the concentration of PAC in the medium over several months. Monolayer cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals, Norcross, GA), 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. For experiments, the cells were trypsinized and allowed to adhere overnight prior to treatment in medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum. For caspase inhibition experiments, the pancaspase inhibitor BOC-Asp-FMK (Enzyme Systems Products, Livermore, CA) or Me2SO vehicle control (final concentration, ≤0.1%) was added 30 min prior to treatment with peptide. Plasmids and Stable Transfection—Plasmids of pCMV and pCMV/mutant temperature-sensitive p53-143 were a kind gift of Dr. Albert Deisseroth (Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, La Jolla, CA). The plasmids were transfected into PC-3 cells by using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). The selection of clones was carried out for 2 weeks with 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). The insertion of the temperature-sensitive p53-143 cDNA was determined by Western blot. The cells were maintained at 37 °C (mutant p53 conformation). Western Blotting Analysis—Following treatment, the cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min. The cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm benzamidine, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 15 min on ice and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The lysates (50 μg) were boiled in SDS sample buffer and loaded on SDS-PAGE. After transferring, immunoreactive products were detected by ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Actin or α-tubulin was used as a control. Peptide Uptake—p53p-Ant uptake into cells was determined by Western blotting and by monitoring uptake of rhodamine B conjugated to the C terminus of the peptide (p53p-Ant-RhoB). The cells were placed on a confocal microscope with 30 μm p53pAnt-RhoB, and uptake was monitored over time. Thirty μm p53pAnt was the IC50 concentration for induction of apoptosis in human mutant p53 breast and colon cancer lines (17Kim A.L. Raffo A.J. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Pincus M.R. Monaco R. Abarzua P.

Kalberer C.P. Wodnar-Filipowicz A. Skoda R.C. Blood. 2004; 103: 4511-4513Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and propagated in 293A cells according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). The virus particle titer after filtration-based concentration (Adeno-X virus purification kit; Clontech) was 1 × 109 pu/ml as determined by plaque titration assay in 293A cells. DU-145 cells in log phase were infected for 48 h with pAd/U6/p53-shRNA or pAd/U6/shuffled-p53-shRNA at a multiplicity of infection of 4, 10, or 20. After infection, the cells were split, allowed to adhere overnight, and exposed to p53p-Ant for 6 h, and annexin V (Anx V) analysis was performed (see below). Flow Cytometric Analysis for PI, TUNEL, ROS, Anx V, and Cell Surface Fas—The cells were incubated in the indicated concentration of peptides for up to 6 h unless otherwise stated. Following treatment, floating and adherent cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in PBS. For PI analysis, the cells were fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, washed in PBS, and incubated with PI staining buffer (10 μg/ml PI and 250 μg/ml RNAse A) (Sigma) for 30 min at 25 °C. For TUNEL analysis, the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min on ice, washed, and fixed in ice-cold 70% ethanol, washed, and incubated with fluorescein-dUTP and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase using the Mebstain apoptosis kit direct (MBL International, Watertown, MA). For ROS measurements, 10 μm DCFDA (2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate or 10 μm dihydroethidium (DHE) (Molecular Probes, Eugene OR) (for O2.) was added in the final 30 min of incubation. The cells were then scraped off the plate, washed, and resuspended in PBS. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-human monoclonal Fas/CD95 antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA) were used to determine cell surface Fas. For combined Anx V/PI analysis, floating and trypsinized cells were pooled and exposed to Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) in binding buffer. PI stain was added (final concentration, 3.3 μg/ml) for 1 min and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and quantified using CELLQuest software. The fluorescent intensity of 10,000 cells were analyzed for PI, and 5000 cells were analyzed for TUNEL, ROS, Anx V, and Fas. Assays for Nucleosomes, Caspase-3 and 8 Activity, ATP, LDH, and MTT—For all assays, the cells were seeded overnight and then incubated with peptides as indicated. All of the assays utilized pooled floating and trypsinized adherent cells and were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cytoplasmic mono- and oligonucleosomes were determined using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for nucleosomes (Roche Applied Science). Caspase-3 or caspase-8 protease activity were determined using colorimetric assay kits (MBL International, Watertown, MA). For intracellular ATP determination, the cells were collected and resuspended in ddH2O and boiled for 5 min. Intracellular ATP levels were determined using a TD 20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale CA) at 560 nm using an ATP determination kit (Molecular Probes). The LDH assay was performed using a CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay for LDH release into the extracellular space (Promega). The maximal LDH release control was obtained by two rounds of freeze-thawing of cells, which fractured the plasma membrane of virtually all cells under the microscope. The MTT assay was performed using a cell proliferation kit (Roche Applied Sciences). Cytotoxicity Analysis by Fluorescence Viability Assay—For determination of necrotic cells after peptide treatment, the cells were initially seeded onto poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips (Becton Dickinson). At the indicated times after peptide treatment, the coverslips were removed and exposed to Calcein AM and Ethidium homodimer-1 using a live/dead viability/cytotoxicty kit (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturers' instructions with pictures taken under a fluorescence microscope, and at least 300 cells were counted per time point by a blinded observer. Confocal and Electron Microscopy—For confocal microscopy, the cells were initially seeded for 24 h in glass-bottomed plates (MatTek Corporation). Following treatment with 30 μm p53p-Ant-RhoB for the indicated times, the cells were viewed (Zeiss LSM 410 confocal laser scanning microscope). For electron microscopy, adherent and floating cells were collected, washed in PBS, and fixed with 2.5% gluteraldehyde-PBS. The fixed cells were rinsed in a 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), postfixed in 2% osmium tetroxide-PBS (pH 7.3), dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol and propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon 812. Sections were cut at 700 Å, stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined with a Jeol JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope. Uptake of p53p-Ant—Ant transduces peptides across plasma and nuclear membranes in a non-cell type-specific manner. Therefore, we investigated by Western blotting whether p53p-Ant could transduce DU-145 cells using the anti-p53 antibody PAb421. Immunoblotting of p53p-Ant alone without cells produced a band of 4.4 kDa (data not shown). A 4.4-kDa band was detected in DU-145 lysates. Similar results were found for PC-3 cells (Fig. 1A). The 4.4-kDa band was not observed in DU-145 cells incubated with p53p alone without Ant (Fig. 1B). The blots were stripped and reprobed with the anti-p53 N-terminal DO-1 antibody, which recognizes p53 but not the p53p-Ant epitope. This confirmed p53 expression in DU-145 cells, which has mutant p53, and confirmed that PC-3 cells were null for p53 (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine subcellular localization of p53p-Ant, live cells were incubated with p53p-Ant-RhoB, and fluorescence was monitored in DU-145 cells by confocal microscopy over 10 min (Fig. 1C). p53p-Ant-RhoB rapidly crossed the plasma membrane, with cytoplasmic, nuclear and nucleolar localization within 1 min, followed by more intense and diffuse accumulation. Similar results were detected in the PC-3 cells (data not shown). Morphological Changes and Cell Viability in DU-145 Cells Treated with p53p-Ant—DU-145 cells were incubated with p53p-Ant, or Ant or p53p alone, or p53AntCONT peptides, and morphology was observed by phase contrast microscopy. Rapid and distinct morphological changes were observed (Fig. 2A) that were not seen in control Ant or p53p or p53AntCONT alone-treated cells. Loss of the typical cobblestone-like appearance was observed, with cells rounding and detaching from the plate at less than 1 h post-treatment. Both plasma and nuclear membranes became more distinct, associated with subsequent swelling. In contrast, PC-3 cells (null p53) showed an initial rounding and plasma membrane ruffling by 1 h, but then the great majority of PC-3 cells regained the appearance of untreated cells by 6 h with ∼10% rounded and detached cells observed (Fig. 2A). As shown by MTT assay, p53p-Ant, but not the controls Ant or p53p alone, induced a reduction in viability as early as 3 h and up to 24 h after treatment (Fig. 2B). p53p-Ant was significantly more inhibitory to DU-145 than PC-3 cells at all time points tested. After 3 h, the PC-3 cells showed only a marginal toxicity of less than 8% compared with DU-145 cells, which exhibited more than 75% toxicity after the same treatment (Fig. 2C). The reduction in cell viability was concentration-dependent with an approximate IC50 of 30 μm, similar to the IC50 concentration previously found in breast cancer cells exposed to p53pAnt (Fig. 2B) (17Kim A.L. Raffo A.J. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Pincus M.R. Monaco R. Abarzua P. Fine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34924-34931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, concentrations up to 50 μm of control peptide p53-AntCONT did not show any inhibition of proliferation, in either PC-3 or DU-145 cells (data not shown). Additional experiments found that 30 μm p53p-Ant increased the percentage of trypan blue-positive cells from 2.2 ± 0.6 to 31.5 ± 1.8% (14.3-fold) in DU-145 and 4.2 ± 1.0 to 8.9 ± 1.1% (2.1-fold) in PC-3 cells, consistent with the results from the viability assay and phase contrast microscopy. In addition, trypan blue-positive cells increased from 12.7 ± 0.7 to 20.5 ± 0.8% (1.6-fold) in the wt p53 prostate cancer cell line LNCaP; from 6.1 ± 2.2 to 10.7 ± 0.7% in the immortalized, nonmaligant prostate cell line P69; and from 5.3 ± 0.3 to 45.6 ± 3.1% (8.6-fold) and 7.2 ± 1.0 to 48.9 ± 2.3% (6.8-fold) in the mutant p53, prostate cancer cell lines 22Rv1 and VCaP, respectively. To further confirm that p53p-Ant-induced cell death was dependent on the presence of mutant p53, cell death in stably transfected temperature-sensitive PC-3 cells expressing mutant p53-143 at 37 °C and wild type p53 at 32 °C was determined. The cells were more sensitive to p53p-Ant at the mutant p53 temperature (37 °C) than at the wt p53 temperature (32 °) (Fig. 2D). This is consistent with BIACORE data showing that p53p-Ant binds wt p53 with 100-fold lower affinity than mutant p53. Measurement of Apoptotic Cell Death Induced by p53p-Ant—We reported that p53p-Ant induced apoptosis without necrosis in mutant p53 but not null p53 breast cancer cell lines (17Kim A.L. Raffo A.J.

Therefore, we examined apoptotic markers in p53p-Ant-induced cytotoxicity. A concentration- and time-dependent sub-G1 peak (typically 30–50%) was detected by flow cytometry of PI-stained cells but not with the controls Ant or p53p alone. Minor cytotoxicity of ∼7% from p53p-Ant was observed in null p53 PC-3 cells (Fig. 3A). DU-145 cells showed a 5.7-fold increase nucleosomal DNA fragments (mono- and oligosomes) in cytoplasmic fractions after a 6-h exposure to p53p-Ant but not to Ant (1.4-fold) or p53p alone (0.9-fold) (Fig. 3B). In contrast, PC-3 cells did not show any accumulation of nucleosomal fragments after a 6-h exposure to p53p-Ant (Fig. 3B). When DU-145 cells were stained simultaneously with Anx V and PI, p53p-Ant induced an increase in Anx V+/PI– cells (apoptotic), within 0.5 min, which became Anx V+/PI+ cells (necrotic), after 5 min, indicating that p53p-Ant first induced apoptosis which was later switched to necrosis (Fig. 3C). In contrast, PC-3 cells, did not show significant cell death. p53p-Ant-induced Death Is Independent of Fas and Caspase Activation—We reported that a 1-h exposure of breast cancer cells to p53p-Ant increased Fas expression without mRNA or protein synthesis, activation of caspase-8 and 3, and PARP cleavage (17Kim A.L. Raffo A.J. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Pincus M.R. Monaco R. Abarzua P. Fine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34924-34931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether prostate cancer cell death by p53p-Ant also involved Fas and caspase activation. Treatment with p53p-Ant for 1 h failed to increase Fas membrane expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis (Fig. 4A). However, the same treatment increased Fas expression in mutant p53 MDA-468 human breast cancer cells, consistent with our previous findings (17Kim A.L. Raffo A.J. Brandt-Rauf P.W. Pincus M.R. Monaco R. Abarzua P. Fine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34924-34931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The PARP cleavage product was also not observed in DU-145 cells under conditions of maximal cell death by peptide. However, DU-145 cells treated with 50 nm PAC induced classical apoptosis (21Haldar S. Chintapalli J. Croce C.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1253-1255PubMed Google Scholar) with PARP cleavage (Fig. 4, B and C). This demonstrated that under conditions that induced apoptosis (PAC treatment), PARP cleavage does occur in DU-145 cells. Additionally, PAC, but not p53p-Ant, increased caspase-3 and -8 activities in DU-145 cells. The lack of caspase-3 activation from p5"

The polypeptide substrate specificity determinants for pea Rubisco large subunit methyltransferase were investigated using a fusion protein construct between the first 23 amino acids from the large subunit of Rubisco and human carbonic anhydrase II. A total of 40 conservative and non-conservative amino acid substitutions flanking the target Lys-14 methylation site (positions P-3 to P+3) were engineered in the fusion protein. The catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of PsLSMT was determined using each of the substitutions and a polypeptide consensus recognition sequence deduced from the results. The consensus sequence, represented by X-(Gly/Ser)-(Phe/Tyr)-Lys-(Ala/Lys/Arg)-(Gly/Ser)-π, where X is any residue, Lys is the methylation site, and π is any aromatic or hydrophobic residue, was used to predict potential alternative substrates for PsLSMT. Four chloroplast-localized proteins were identified including γ-tocopherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT). In vitro methylation assays using PsLSMT and a bacterially expressed form of γ-TMT from Perilla frutescens confirmed recognition and methylation of γ-TMT by PsLSMT in vitro. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the PsLSMT homologue (NtLSMT) in transgenic tobacco plants resulted in a 2-fold decrease of α-tocopherol, the product of γ-TMT. The results demonstrate the efficacy of consensus sequence-driven identification of alternative substrates for PsLSMT as well as identification of functional attributes of protein methylation catalyzed by LSMT.

Two of these modifications are methylations, one on the ϵ-amine of Lys-14 in the large subunit (LS (2Houtz R.L. Stults J.T. Mulligan R.M. Tolbert N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) and another on the α-amine of Met-1 in the small subunit (4Grimm R. Grimm M. Eckerskorn C. Pohlmeyer K. Rohl T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Methylation at Lys-14 is catalyzed by LSMT (EC. 2.1.1.127), a highly conserved SET domain protein lysine methyltransferase (PKMT) found in all plant species as well as orthologues in representative organisms across all eukaryotic species (5Dirk L.M.A. Trievel R.C. Houtz R.L. Tamanoi F. Clarke S. The Enzymes. 2006: 179-228Google Scholar). LSMT transcripts are coordinately expressed with the LS of Rubisco through several light-regulated promoter elements and are predominantly found in leaf tissue (6Klein R.R. Houtz R.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 249-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Despite much effort, an exact role for LSMT and Lys-14 methylation in the LS of Rubisco remains obscure. Although there is a partial correlation of LSMT activity with plant species known to exhibit light/dark regulation of Rubisco activity through changes in carboxyarabinitol-1-P levels (3Houtz R.L. Portis A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), there are other plant species without Lys-14 methylation that nonetheless have LSMT homologues, some of which are alternatively spliced (7Ying Z. Mulligan R.M. Janney N. Houtz R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36750-36756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Thus, there may be several different roles played by Lys-14 methylation as well as LSMT that vary in a species-specific manner (3Houtz R.L. Portis A.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 414: 150-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase founding members of the domain SU-(VAR)3–9, E(Z), and TRX protein lysine methyltransferase S-adenosyl-l-methionine P. sativum large subunit of Rubisco methyltransferase Nicotiana tabacum large subunit of Rubisco methyltransferase human carbonic anhydrase large subunit polyvinylidene difluoride γ-tocopherol methyltransferase N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine. SET domain PKMTs are well known for their role in the methylation of histones and subsequent influence on epigenetic gene expression (8Shilatifard A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 243-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 9Trievel R.C. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 2004; 14: 147-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 10Lee D.Y. Teyssier C. Strahl B.D. Stallcup M.R. Endocr. Rev. 2005; 26: 147-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Although PKMTs have in the past been regarded as having exceptionally high polypeptide substrate specificity, recent results clearly demonstrate that PKMTs can have more than one polypeptide substrate. Human Smyd2 (11Brown M.A. Sims R.J. II I Gottlieb P.D. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cancer. 2006; 5: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), specific for Lys-36 in H3 histones, also methylates Lys-370 in p53 (12Huang J. Perez-Burgos L. Placek B.J. Sengupta R. Richter M.

Nature. 2006; 444: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), and SET1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, specific for Lys-4 in H3 histones, methylates, as well, lysyl residues in DAM1 (13Zhang K.

Talianidis I. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 175-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) as well as Lys-372 in p53 (17Chuikov S. Kurash J.K. Wilson J.R. Xiao B. Justin N. Ivanov G.S. McKinney K. Tempst P. Prives C. Gamblin S.J. Barlev N.A. Reinberg D. Nature. 2004; 432: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Examination of the structural basis for substrate flexibility in SET 7/9 revealed a consensus recognition sequence that was used to tentatively identify other polypeptide substrates with data base search engines (18Couture J.F. Collazo E. Hauk G. Trievel R.C. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Identification of alternative substrates for PKMTs and consensus sequence requirements for catalytic activity broadens the repertoire of target polypeptide substrates, but more importantly, can also lead to an increased understanding of previously unknown functional aspects of protein methylation (19Couture J.F. Trievel R.C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2006; 16: 753-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). PKMT protein specificity studies frequently rely on synthetic polypeptide substrates and/or site-directed mutagenesis of the target polypeptide substrate. With LSMT, however, polypeptide mimics of the N-terminal region of the LS, specifically acetylated-Pro-3 to Tyr-25, do not bind with any appreciable affinity to LSMT, and furthermore, the hexadecameric plant forms of Rubisco cannot be expressed and assembled in bacteria. To explore the determinants of polypeptide substrate specificity for Pisum sativum (pea) LSMT (PsLSMT) and potentially identify new alternative substrates, an artificial polypeptide substrate was created by fusing the C terminus of the first 23 amino acids from the LS of spinach Rubisco (N-terminal residue directly determined as N-acetyl-proline; from Pro-3 to Tyr-25) to the N termini of human carbonic anhydrase II (HCA II). This fusion protein (LS·HCA II) was acceptable as a substrate for PsLSMT and allowed an examination of the amino acid sequence requirements for recognition of Rubisco by PsLSMT. In the present work, we report the amino acid consensus sequence required for the trimethylation of Lys-14 in the LS of Rubisco by examining the effect of amino acid replacements in the region encompassing residues Val-11 to Val-17. The consensus sequence was used to screen protein databases and identify putative alternate substrates. Chloroplastic γ-to-copherol methyltransferase (γ-TMT) was identified and confirmed as a potential alternative substrate for PsLSMT in vitro. Analysis of the amounts of α-tocopherol (the product of γ-TMT) in LSMT knockdown tobacco plants suggested that methylation of γ-TMT results in increased activity in vivo. Enzymes, Substrates, and Chemicals-PsLSMT (residues 38–485, 51.7 kDa) was expressed and purified as described previously (20Trievel R.C. Beach B.M. Dirk L.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H.

Biochem. 2005; 342: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and was judged to be greater than 95% homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE. Des(methyl) spinach Rubisco was purified from spinach leaves (23McCurry S.D. Gee R. Tolbert N.E. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 90: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). S-Adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet) from Sigma was purified prior to use (24Chirpich T.P. Zappia V. Costilow R.N. Barker H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 1778-1789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HiTrap™ chelating columns and [methyl-3H]AdoMet (∼70–80 Ci mmol-1) were from GE Healthcare. AdoMet was diluted to a specific activity of 1–4 μCi nmol-1 for enzyme assays. Immobilon-P (PVDF) membrane and MF-Millipore membrane filters (0.025 μm) were from Millipore Corp. (Billerica, MA). His-Mag agarose beads, Benzonase® nuclease, and pET 23b and 23d expression plasmids were from Novagen (EMD Biosciences, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). pGEM-T Easy Vector System I was from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). BL21(DE3)pLysS competent cells, PfuUltra™ high fidelity DNA polymerase, and the StrataScript® first-strand cDNA synthesis kit were from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). T4 DNA ligase and restriction enzymes were products of Invitrogen, and acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution was from Bio-Rad Laboratories. QIAquick® gel extraction kit and RNeasy plant mini kit were from Qiagen Sciences (Germantown, MD). Metaphor® agarose was from Lonza Bioscience (Rockland, ME). pRK2013 helper plasmid was purchased from Clontech. Tocol was purchased from Mantreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). Hexane, acetonitrile, and methanol were high pressure liquid chromatography grade. All other chemicals and reagents were from Sigma. Seeds of Perilla frutescens were procured from Southern Exposure Seed Exchange (Mineral, VA). LS·HCA II Fusion Protein Constructs-The DNA encoding human carbonic anhydrase (HCA II) was obtained as a kind gift from Prof. P. Laipis (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL) in a modified pET 31 bacterial expression vector (25Tanhauser S.M. Jewell D.A. Tu C.K. Silverman D.N. Laipis P.J. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 117: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) with 5′-NcoI and 3′-XhoI restriction sites. Twenty-two base pairs overlapping sense and antisense oligonucleotides (OL34.1, 34.2; supplemental Table S1), encoding the N-terminal amino acids of the LS of Rubisco from Pro-3 to Tyr-25 (with an initiating Met) and the first 5 amino acids of HCA II, were synthesized as indicated in supplemental Table S1 with an intervening NcoI site. Two additional primers (OL34.3, 34.4; supplemental Table S1) were synthesized for amplification of the HCA II with a 31-bp overlap with the 3′-end of the previous primer set and a 3′-end XhoI site. After two separate PCR reactions created the respective fragments, the products were separated on gels (Metaphor agarose for the 96-bp amplicon) and purified with a QIAquick® gel extraction kit. The gel-purified products were mixed together in a PCR reaction, and after 10 cycles, full-length fusion DNA was amplified by including OL34.1 and OL34.4 (0.15 μm of each; supplemental Table S1) for a further 20 cycles. After TA cloning to pGEM-T Easy, the full-length fusion was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated with T4 DNA ligase into predigested pET 23b expression plasmid. The ligated fusion DNA in the LS·HCA II construct was verified by DNA sequencing and transformed to BL21(DE3)pLysS cells for expression. Sequence Mutations-Mutations were generated in the LS·HCA II construct using mutated oligonucleotides as listed in supplemental Table S1. Equal amounts of mutated (42 single point substitutions and 3 multiple point substitutions; supplemental Table S1) and reverse primer (OL34.4; supplemental Table S1) were mixed with the LS·HCA II construct as template DNA, and the resultant amplicon was digested with NdeI and XhoI and ligated into pET 23b expression vector. All recombinant clones were sequenced for validation of insert and desired mutation. LS·HCA II Protein Purification-Purification of LS·HCA II proteins was performed as described by Banerjee et al. (26Banerjee A.L. Swanson M. Mallik S. Srivastava D.K. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 37: 450-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), with the following modifications. An induction time of 5 h at 25 °C with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used once the culture in Luria-Bertani medium (LB) containing ampicillin (100 μgml-1) and chloramphenicol (34 μgml-1) reached an A600 of 0.5. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 10 min and lysed using four cycles of freeze-thaw in the presence of 0.01% (v/v) Benzonase® nuclease with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g, the supernatant was applied to a HiTrap™ chelating column charged with 0.3 m ZnSO4, and LS·HCA II was eluted with a linear gradient of imidazole from 0 to 125 mm. Fractions containing LS·HCA II were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed for 1 h using MF-Millipore membrane filters against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8. Western Blot and Phosphorimages-Western blot and phosphorimage analyses were performed on proteins electrophoretically transferred from SDS-PAGE gels (12.5% acrylamide) to PVDF membranes. Western blots were performed using an antibody specific for the N terminus of the LS of spinach Rubisco (residues 3–25). Phosphorimage analyses of radiolabel incorporation from [methyl-3H]AdoMet into proteins transferred to PVDF membranes utilized exposure times from 24 to 48 h depending on the level of radioactivity. PsLSMT Methyltransferase Assays-PsLSMT activity was determined as described previously (20Trievel R.C. Beach B.M. Dirk L.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H. Cell. 2002; 111: 91-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 21Trievel R.C. Flynn E.M. Houtz R.L. Hurley J.H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, assays contained 100 mm Bicine, 20 mm MgCl2 pH 8, [methyl-3H]AdoMet (7–9 × 105 dpm nmol-1 at various concentrations), 4 μg of PsLSMT, and indicated amounts of LS·HCA II fusion protein in a final volume of 20 μl. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 2 min and terminated by the addition of 25 volumes of 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. The precipitated protein pellet was dissolved with 150 μl of 0.1 n NaOH and precipitated again prior to dissolution in 50 μl of formic acid, the addition of scintillation mixture, and the determination of radioactivity. Kinetic parameters (Km and kcat) were obtained from fitted Michaelis-Menten equations using SigmaPlot (version 10), except when mutations resulted in large increases in the Km. Under these conditions, the slope of the velocity versus substrate concentration plot was used as an estimate of kcat/Km (27Couture J.F. Collazo E. Brunzelle J.S. Trievel R.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). All assays were optimized for linearity with time and enzyme concentration, and substrate consumption was limited to 20% or less. γ-TMT Cloning, Expression, and Purification-Seeds of P. frutescens were cultured in the greenhouse. Total RNA from immature embryos was isolated with the RNeasy plant mini kit following the manufacturer's directions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized using an oligo(dT) primer and the reagents provided with the StrataScript® first-strand cDNA synthesis kit. The full-length cDNA of the γ-TMT gene (GenBank™ accession number AF213481) was then amplified from the first-strand cDNA using the oligonucleotide 5′-GTCAAAATCACCAATTACCTATTT-3′, oligo(dT), and PfuUltra™ high fidelity DNA polymerase. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.0% agarose gel, and the expected 1369-bp amplicon was excised from the gel. The DNA fragment was purified using the QIAquick® gel extraction kit, ligated into a pGEM-T Easy® cloning vector, and sequenced. The full-length γ-TMT cDNA was truncated at the N terminus according to the predicted chloroplast processing site from ChloroP 1.1 (28Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar) to obtain a clone encoding the mature form of the enzyme. Accordingly, a forward primer (5′-CCATGGCGGAGATGGAGACGGAGATGGAG-3′ at 299 bp in the γ-TMT cDNA with an ATG and an NcoI restriction site), a reverse primer (5′-CTCGAGAGATGCAGGTTTTCGGCATGTA-3′ at 1195 bp with a XhoI restriction site), and PfuUltra™ high fidelity DNA polymerase were used to amplify the partial cDNA. The amplicon was sequenced and then digested using NcoI and XhoI; the fragment was ligated into pET 23d in-frame with the histidine tag. The vector was then transformed to BL21(DE3)pLysS cells for expression. Transformed colonies were induced when A600 was 0.6 with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and vigorously shaken at 25 °C overnight. Harvested cells were disrupted with four cycles of freeze-thaw and one quick cycle of sonication, and the tagged protein was purified using His-Mag agarose beads following manufacturer's instructions. Construction of NtLSMT Knockdown Tobacco Plants-The full-length cDNA for tobacco Rubisco LSMT (29Ying Z. Janney N. Houtz R.L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 663-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was cloned in the sense or antisense orientation into the multiple cloning site of the binary vector pKYLX (30Schardl C.L. Byrd A.D. Benzion G. Altschuler M.A. Hildebrand D.F. Hunt A.G. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3850 was transformed with the sense or antisense construct by triparental mating (31Ditta G. Stanfield S. Corbin D. Helinski D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7347-7351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1888) Google Scholar) with Escherichia coli HB101 containing the pRK2013 helper plasmid. The sense or antisense construct was introduced into tobacco (cv Petite Havana) using A. tumefaciens-mediated transformation following the standard leaf disk method (32Horsch R.B. Fry J.E. Hoffmann N.L. Eichholtz D. Rogers S.G. Fraley R.T. Science. 1985; 227: 1229-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (3790) Google Scholar). PCR was used to confirm the presence of the sense or antisense 35S-Rubisco LSMT transgene in the genome of the tobacco plants. Plants (T2) identified by PCR as positively transformed were crossed sense with antisense to generate RNA interference for Rubisco LSMT (33Waterhouse P.M. Graham M.W. Wang M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13959-13964Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). The progenies (F1) were screened for in vitro substrate susceptibility of tobacco Rubisco to incorporate methyl groups from [methyl-3H]AdoMet in the presence of PsLSMT. γ-TMT Activity Assays and Product Analyses-A tobacco leaf disk (12-mm diameter) was incubated in 150 μl of buffer (50 mm Bicine, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 3 mm γ-tocopherol and 10 μl of [methyl-3H]AdoMet (77 Ci mmol-1) for 3 h under constant illumination (360 μmol m-2 s-1) at room temperature (∼25 °C). Total tocopherols were then extracted as described previously (34Sanchez-Machado D.I. Lopez-Cervantes J. Vazquez N.J. J. Chromatogr. A. 2006; 1105: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) by grinding the leaf disk in 5 ml of 0.5 m KOH in methanol after the addition of 20 μg of tocol as an internal standard. The suspension was incubated for 15 min at 80 °C followed by the addition of 1 ml of Nanopure H2O and 5 ml of hexane. The samples were vortexed and centrifuged for 2 min at 600 × g for phase separation. The hexane was collected and evaporated under nitrogen, and the residue was resuspended in acetonitrile:methanol 95:5 (v/v). Tocopherols were separated on a Waters Nova-Pak® C18 4-mm reverse phase column (300 - 3.9 mm) with acetonitrile:methanol 95:5 (v/v) at 1 ml min-1 for 35 min using detection at 214 nm. The peak corresponding to α-tocopherol was collected for the determination of radiolabel incorporation. The determination of α-tocopherol amounts was essentially identical to the aforementioned procedure except that 20 disks were used for each determination. All analyses were replicated at least four times, and the percentage of recovery was calculated from the tocol internal standard according to linear standard curves with R2 above 0.99. The LS·HCA II protein fusion was evaluated as a polypeptide substrate for PsLSMT. The fusion protein exhibited a slightly higher molecular mass than HCA II (∼2.6 kDa, corresponding to the N-terminal sequence from the LS of Rubisco), immunoreactivity with an antibody specific for the N-terminal amino acid sequence (residues 3–25) of the LS of Rubisco, and more importantly, radiolabel incorporation from [methyl-3H]AdoMet in the presence of PsLSMT (Fig. 1A). The fusion protein was thus considered as a potentially effective tool for mapping the polypeptide substrate specificity of PsLSMT. There are 3 additional lysyl residues (other than the Lys-14 methylation site) within the LS N-terminal sequence located at positions 8, 18, and 21. Mutagenesis of these residues to either Arg or Ala did not affect methylation of Lys-14 by PsLSMT, whereas mutagenesis of the Lys-14 methylation site abolished methylation (Fig. 1B). The methylation site specificity was, thus, not altered in the LS·HCA II protein. Additionally, product analyses confirmed that the predominant methylation product was ϵ-N-trimethyllysine (Fig. 1C, MexK), identical to previous results with Rubisco. Kinetic analyses of PsLSMT using the LS·HCA II protein as a polypeptide substrate revealed an increase in the apparent Km when compared with Rubisco from 1.4 μm to 1.2 mm, a decrease in kcat from 2.4 to 0.6 min-1, and a change in catalytic efficiency from 1.7 μm-1 min-1 to 0.5 mm-1 min-1 (Fig. 2A). Although reduced, the catalytic rate constant was still within the range of activities reported for several other SET domain PKMTs (27Couture J.F. Collazo E. Brunzelle J.S. Trievel R.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 35Dirk L.M. Flynn E.M. Dietzel K. Couture J.F. Trievel R.C. Houtz R.L. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 3905-3915Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 36Patnaik D. Chin H.G. Esteve P.O. Benner J. Jacobsen S.E. Pradhan S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53248-53258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); however, the weaker binding affinity suggests that other regions of PsLSMT interact with Rubisco outside the immediate target methylation site and that those regions contribute to the affinity of polypeptide substrate binding. Nevertheless, this is unlikely to compromise the determination of substrate specificity, but likely, instead, to provide a more conservative estimate of substrate specificity. An examination of AdoMet kinetics revealed a change in the Km from 6 to 19 μm and a similar change in kcat as described above. Each of the flanking 3 residues surrounding the Lys-14 methylation site (those before Lys-14 denoted as P-3, P-2, and P-1 and those after Lys-14 denoted P+1, P+2, and P+3) was individually mutagenized using amino acid substitutions reflecting the entire range of general side chain chemistries, and the LS·HCA II polypeptide was evaluated as a substrate for PsLSMT (Fig. 3). Kinetic plots of PsLSMT activity revealed changes in both kcat and apparent Km; therefore, catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) was considered as a better measure of polypeptide substrate specificity. As an example, PsLSMT activity using mutated LS·HCA II Val-11 to Lys and Val-17 to Leu had similar apparent Km values, and yet, due to differences in kcat, PsLSMT processed the Val-11 to Lys substrate more efficiently than unmodified substrate, whereas PsLSMT processed the Val-17 to Leu substrate with similar efficiency. Furthermore, some mutations led to increases in the Km of PsLSMT to the extent that saturated velocities could not be obtained. Under these conditions, however, the kcat/Km can be estimated from the initial slope of the enzyme velocity versus substrate concentration plot (27Couture J.F. Collazo E. Brunzelle J.S. Trievel R.C. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1455-1465Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), as denoted in Fig. 3 by L following the efficiency estimate. Out of 40 single point substitutions (excluding substitutions at Lys-14), 13 were acceptable as substrates (Fig. 3). The remaining substitutions either resulted in protein that was insoluble or supported activity too low to be considered a substrate for PsLSMT. There was limited symmetry of the tolerated substitutions around the methylation site in that the majority of replacements at the P-3 and P+3 positions, regardless of degree of conservation, were suitable as PsLSMT substrates. All substitutions at position 11 (P-3) were tolerated, suggesting considerable flexibility in the position normally occupied by Val-11, whereas negative and polar substitutions at P+3 of the hydrophobic Val-17 were not considered substrates. Generally, substitutions were not well tolerated at P-2 and P+2; only Ser was acceptable as a replacement for either Gly-12 or Gly-16. At the P-1 site, Tyr, but not Trp, partly substituted for Phe-13, suggesting a preference at this position for residues with an aromatic side chain but with a particular side chain volume; 189.0 Å3 for Phe and 193.6 Å3 for Tyr were suitable, but neither 227.8 Å3 for Trp nor 153.2 Å3 for His were acceptable (37Zamyatnin A.A. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1972; 24: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). At the P+1 position, several substitutions supported low but detectable PsLSMT activity, and both Arg and Lys were well tolerated substitutions. Three non-conservative substitutions resulted in increased substrate acceptability, namely, Lys and Ser at position P-3 (∼3- and 2-fold, respectively) and Lys at position P+1 (∼4-"
