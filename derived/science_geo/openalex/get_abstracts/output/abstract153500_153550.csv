https://openalex.org/W2062188301,"Posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) in plants results from the degradation of mRNAs and shows phenomenological similarities with quelling in fungi and RNAi in animals. Here, we report the isolation of sgs2 and sgs3 Arabidopsis mutants impaired in PTGS. We establish a mechanistic link between PTGS, quelling, and RNAi since the Arabidopsis SGS2 protein is similar to an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase like N. crassa QDE-1, controlling quelling, and C. elegans EGO-1, controlling RNAi. In contrast, SGS3 shows no significant similarity with any known or putative protein, thus defining a specific step of PTGS in plants. Both sgs2 and sgs3 mutants show enhanced susceptibility to virus, definitively proving that PTGS is an antiviral defense mechanism that can also target transgene RNA for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2107330252,"Posttranscriptional gene silencing is a defense mechanism in plants that is similar to quelling in fungi and RNA interference in animals. Here, we describe four genetic loci that are required for posttranscriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis. One of these, SDE1, is a plant homolog of QDE-1 in Neurospora crassa that encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The sde1 mutation was specific for posttranscriptional gene silencing induced by transgenes rather than by viruses. We propose that the role of SDE1 is to synthesize a double-stranded RNA initiator of posttranscriptional gene silencing. According to this idea, when a virus induces posttranscriptional gene silencing, the virus-encoded RNA polymerase would produce the double-stranded RNA and SDE1 would be redundant."
https://openalex.org/W2119195901,"Asymmetric cell divisions play an important role in the establishment and propagation of the cellular pattern of plant tissues. The SHORT-ROOT (SHR) gene is required for the asymmetric cell division responsible for formation of ground tissue (endodermis and cortex) as well as specification of endodermis in the Arabidopsis root. We show that SHR encodes a putative transcription factor with homology to SCARECROW (SCR). From analyses of gene expression and cell identity in genetically stable and unstable alleles of shr, we conclude that SHR functions upstream of SCR and participates in a radial signaling pathway. Consistent with a regulatory role in radial patterning, ectopic expression of SHR results in supernumerary cell divisions and abnormal cell specification in the root meristem."
https://openalex.org/W2044484847,"The genesis of vertebrate peripheral ganglia poses the problem of how multipotent neural crest stem cells (NCSCs) can sequentially generate neurons and then glia in a local environment containing strong instructive neurogenic factors, such as BMP2. Here we show that Notch ligands, which are normally expressed on differentiating neuroblasts, can inhibit neurogenesis in NCSCs in a manner that is completely dominant to BMP2. Contrary to expectation, Notch activation did not maintain these stem cells in an uncommitted state or promote their self-renewal. Rather, even a transient activation of Notch was sufficient to cause a rapid and irreversible loss of neurogenic capacity accompanied by accelerated glial differentiation. These data suggest that Notch ligands expressed by neuroblasts may act positively to instruct a cell-heritable switch to gliogenesis in neighboring stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2038661569,"It has been puzzling that mammalian telomeric proteins, including TRF1, TRF2, tankyrase, and TIN2 have no recognized orthologs in budding yeast. Here, we describe a human protein, hRap1, that is an ortholog of the yeast telomeric protein, scRap1p. hRap1 has three conserved sequence motifs in common with scRap1, is located at telomeres, and affects telomere length. However, while scRap1 binds telomeric DNA directly, hRap1 is recruited to telomeres by TRF2. Extending the comparison of telomeric proteins to fission yeast, we identify S. pombe Taz1 as a TRF ortholog, indicating that TRFs are conserved at eukaryotic telomeres. The data suggest that ancestral telomeres, like those of vertebrates, contained a TRF-like protein as well as Rap1. We propose that budding yeast preserved Rap1 at telomeres but lost the TRF component, possibly concomitant with a change in the telomeric repeat sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2082421546,"The connections formed between sensory and motor neurons (MNs) play a critical role in the control of motor behavior. During development, the axons of proprioceptive sensory neurons project into the spinal cord and form both direct and indirect connections with MNs. Two ETS transcription factors, ER81 and PEA3, are expressed by developing proprioceptive neurons and MNs, raising the possibility that these genes are involved in the formation of sensory-motor connections. Er81 mutant mice exhibit a severe motor discoordination, yet the specification of MNs and induction of muscle spindles occurs normally. The motor defect in Er81 mutants results from a failure of group Ia proprioceptive afferents to form a discrete termination zone in the ventral spinal cord. As a consequence there is a dramatic reduction in the formation of direct connections between proprioceptive afferents and MNs. ER81 therefore controls a late step in the establishment of functional sensory-motor circuitry in the developing spinal cord."
https://openalex.org/W2079912175,"Mammalian thioredoxin reductases (TrxR) are dimers homologous to glutathione reductase with a selenocysteine (SeCys) residue in the conserved C-terminal sequence -Gly-Cys-SeCys-Gly. We removed the selenocysteine insertion sequence in the rat gene, and we changed the SeCys(498) encoded by TGA to Cys or Ser by mutagenesis. The truncated protein having the C-terminal SeCys-Gly dipeptide deleted, expected in selenium deficiency, was also engineered. All three mutant enzymes were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity with 1 mol of FAD per monomeric subunit. Anaerobic titrations with NADPH rapidly generated the A(540 nm) absorbance resulting from the thiolate-flavin charge transfer complex characteristic of mammalian TrxR. However, only the SeCys(498) --> Cys enzyme showed catalytic activity in reduction of thioredoxin, with a 100-fold lower k(cat) and a 10-fold lower K(m) compared with the wild type rat enzyme. The pH optimum of the SeCys(498) --> Cys mutant enzyme was 9 as opposed to 7 for the wild type TrxR, strongly suggesting involvement of the low pK(a) SeCys selenol in the enzyme mechanism. Whereas H(2)O(2) was a substrate for the wild type enzyme, all mutant enzymes lacked hydroperoxidase activity. Thus selenium is required for the catalytic activities of TrxR explaining the essential role of this trace element in cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W2029186790,"Morphogenesis and cell differentiation in multicellular organisms often require accurate control of cell divisions. We show that a novel cell cycle regulator, tribbles, is critical for this control during Drosophila development. During oogenesis, the level of tribbles affects the number of germ cell divisions as well as oocyte determination. The mesoderm anlage enters mitosis prematurely in tribbles mutant embryos, leading to gastrulation defects. We show that Tribbles acts by specifically inducing degradation of the CDC25 mitotic activators String and Twine via the proteosome pathway. By regulating CDC25, Tribbles serves to coordinate entry into mitosis with morphogenesis and cell fate determination."

https://openalex.org/W2007857578,"Stages in development with rapid transitions between mitosis and morphogenesis may require specific mechanisms to coordinate cell shape change. Here we describe a novel mitotic inhibitor that acts during Drosophila gastrulation to counteract String/Cdc25, specifically in the cells that invaginate to form the mesoderm. We have identified two genes, frühstart and tribbles, that are required for this ventral inhibition. tribbles encodes a kinase-related protein whose RNA, however, is also present outside of the ventral region. Effective inhibition of mitosis in the cells of the ventral furrow depends on the transcription factor Snail that triggers the ventral cell shape changes. When overexpressed in a microinjection assay, Tribbles directly inhibits mitosis. We propose that Frühstart and Tribbles form a link between the morphogenetic movements and mitotic control."

https://openalex.org/W2024396222,"Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) play an important role in regulating cellular differentiation and proliferation in several types of mammalian cells. One mechanism for this action involves modulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-mediated cellular responses. This report examines the expression of Prx I and Prx II in thyroid cells and their roles in eliminating H2O2 produced in response to thyrotropin (TSH). Prx I and Prx II are constitutively expressed in FRTL-5 thyroid cells. Prx I expression, but not Prx II expression, is stimulated by exposure to TSH and H2O2. In addition, methimazole induces a high level of Prx I mRNA and protein in these cells. Overexpression of Prx I and Prx II enhances the elimination of H2O2 produced by TSH in FRTL-5 cells. Treatment with 500 μm H2O2 causes apoptosis in FRTL-5 cells as evidenced by standard assays of apoptosis (i.e. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate-biotin nick end labeling, BAX expression, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. Overexpression of Prx I and Prx II reduces the amount of H2O2-induced apoptosis measured by these assays. These results suggest that Prx I and Prx II are involved in the removal of H2O2 in thyroid cells and can protect these cells from undergoing apoptosis.

The antithyroid drug methimazole (MMI) is an immunomodulatory agent (18.Cho B.Y. Shong M. Yi K.H. Lee H.K. Koh C.S. Min H.K. Clin.

Recently, the ability of peroxiredoxins (Prxs) to eliminate H2O2 was described in a variety of cells in response to external stimuli (24.Lee T.H., Yu, S.L. Kim S.U. Kim Y.M. Choi I. Kang S.W.

Prx exists as multiple isoforms in mammalian cells (26.Lyu M.S. Rhee S.G. Chae H.Z. Lee T.H. Adamson M.C. Kang S.W. Jin D.Y. Jeang K.T. Kozak C.A. Mamm.

The amino acid sequence of Prx is similar to thioredoxin peroxidase, a 25-kDa peroxidase initially identified in yeast (27.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

However, the mechanisms that control the level of intracellular peroxiredoxins are still obscure (32.Matsumoto A. Okado A. Fujii T. Fujii J. Egashira M. Niikawa N. Taniguchi N.

These two Prx isoforms are constitutively expressed, but the expression of Prx I is modulated by TSH and MMI. Prx I and Prx II play a role in the elimination of H2O2 produced in response to TSH. In addition, Prx I and Prx II modulate the apoptotic response to H2O2 in thyroid cells. These results are the first evidence that peroxiredoxins are involved in regulating the level of intracellular H2O2 induced by TSH and H2O2-induced apoptosis in the thyroid gland. Highly purified bovine TSH was from Sigma. The antibodies to peroxiredoxin isoforms were provided by Dr. Rhee (NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). These antibodies were generated by injecting rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugated peptide that corresponds to the sequences in the COOH-terminal region of Prx isoforms (27.Kang S.W. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. The source of all other materials was Sigma, unless otherwise noted. FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells (Interthyr Research Foundation, Baltimore, MD) were a fresh subclone (F1) that had all properties previously detailed (34.Kohn, L. D., Valente, W. A., Grollman, E. F., Aloj, S. M., and Vitti, P. (September 2, 1986) U. S. Patent 4,609,622Google Scholar). Their doubling time with TSH was 36 ± 6 h; without TSH, they did not proliferate. After cells were maintained for 6 days in medium lacking TSH, addition of 1 milliunit/ml TSH stimulated thymidine incorporation into DNA by at least 10-fold. Cells were diploid and between their 5th and 20th passages. Cells were grown in 6H medium consisting of Coon's modified F12 supplemented with 5% calf serum, 1 mm nonessential amino acids and a mixture of six hormones: bovine TSH (1 milliunit/ml), insulin (10 μg/ml), cortisol (0.4 ng/ml), transferrin (5 μg/ml), glycyl-l-histidyl-l-lysine acetate (10 ng/ml), and somatostatin (10 ng/ml). Fresh medium was added to all cells every 2 or 3 days, and cells were passaged every 7–10 days. In individual experiments, cells were shifted to 5H medium lacking TSH and 5% calf serum; after incubation in this medium, TSH, MMI, or other agents were added as noted. For Northern analysis, total RNA was prepared from the tissues of a Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat according to the standard method (35.Kingston R.E. Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Ausubel F.M.

The polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into pCR3.1TM basic vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) to yield pCRprx I and pCRprx II. Clones containing the coding sequences in the correct orientation were selected and used for transfection. All plasmid preparations were purified twice by CsCl gradient centrifugation (40.Montani V.

Transient transfection used an electroporation technique (Gene Pulser II, Bio-Rad). Cells were harvested, washed, and suspended at 1.5 × 107 cells/ml in 0.8 ml of electroporation buffer (272 mm sucrose, 7 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7.4, and 1 mm MgCl2). Cells were pulsed (330 V; capacitance, 900 microfarads), plated (approximately 6 × 106 cells/dish), and cultured for 48 h. Cell viability was approximately 80%. Immunoblot analyses were performed using anti-Prx I or anti-Prx II antibody (38.Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S. Kim K. Baines I.C. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

Adherent FRTL-5 cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of MMI (1 mm), TSH (1 milliunit/ml) or H2O2 (100 μm) for 4 h at 37 °C. The treated cells were scraped, lysed by addition of SDS sample buffer (62.5 mmTris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% (w/v) SDS, 30% glycerol, 125 mmdithiothreitol, 0.03% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis along with biotinylated molecular weight standards. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane by electrotransfer for 2 h. After soaking the membrane in blocking buffer (1× Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween-20 with blocking reagent 5% milk) the membrane was incubated with the primary antibodies (anti-Prx I and anti-Prx II antibodies) overnight at 4 °C. Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit secondary antibody and chemiluminescent detection system (Phototope®-horseradish peroxidase Western blot detection kit, New England Biolabs). Intracellular H2O2 was assayed in FRTL-5 cells with a fluorescent dye, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA), as described (42.Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Briefly, phosphate-buffered saline-washed FRTL-5 cells were stimulated with TSH (1 milliunit/ml), rapidly washed once with Krebs-Ringer solution, and then incubated in Krebs-Ringer solution containing DCFH-DA (5 μg/ml). DCFH-DA is nonpolar and readily diffuses into cells, where it is hydrolyzed to the nonfluorescent polar derivative DCFH and thereby trapped within the cells. In the presence of H2O2, DCFH is oxidized to the highly fluorescent 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). DCF fluorescence was measured with a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope equipped with a X20 Neoflur objective and Zeiss LSM410 confocal attachment. To avoid photooxidation of DCFH, fluorescent images were collected with a single rapid scan (four-line average; total scan time, 4.33 s) and identical parameters such as contrast and brightness for all samples. The cells were then examined by differential interference contrast microscopy. Five groups of 10–20 subconfluent cells or 20–30 confluent cells were randomly selected from the image for each sample. The average fluorescence intensity for each group was calculated from the fluorescence intensity per cell. Averages were from five group values. Apoptosis of FRTL-5 cells were evaluated by using an detection kit (Promega, Inc., Madison, WI). FRTL-5 cells that were transfected with pCRprx I and pCRprx II were cultured on glass coverslips for 48 h after reaching confluency. The cell-coated coverslips were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 20 min. Coverslips were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the cells were made permeable by incubating in 0.2% Triton® X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C for 15 min. Cells with fragmented nuclear DNA were detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (0.5 units/μl) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dUTP (0.5 nmol/μl) from Promega (Madison, WI); incubations were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-dUTP fluorescence was detected using the following filter combinations: BP 450–490/LP520 installed on an Episcopic fluorescence microscope from Nikon, Inc. (Melville, NY). The proportion of apoptotic cells was determined by dividing the number of cells with a TUNEL-positive nucleus, measured on 10–20 randomly taken fields by the total number of cells in the corresponding fields. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad) and used recrystallized bovine serum albumin as the standard. All experiments were repeated at least three times with different batches of cells. Values are the mean ± S.E. Significance between experimental values was determined by two-way analysis of variance. The expression of Prx I and Prx II was examined by Northern hybridization analysis using RNA from rat tissues (Fig.1 A). Hybridization conditions were stringent in order to avoid cross-hybridization of the Prx I and Prx II cDNA probes. Single Prx I and Prx II transcripts were detected at variable expression levels in the tissues examined. Prx I mRNA was expressed at a lower level in the brain than in testis, kidney, muscle, liver, lung, spleen, thyroid, and heart (Fig. 1 A, top panel). Prx II mRNA was expressed at much higher level in heart than in other tissues (Fig. 1 A). Prx II mRNA was expressed at a comparable level in thyroid, testis, kidney, and liver. The regulation of Prx gene expression was studied in FRTL-5 thyroid cells treated with TSH, H2O2, forskolin, or MMI (Fig. 1 B). Cells were cultured in 6H5% medium until reaching confluence, maintained in 5% 5H medium lacking TSH for 7 days, and treated with TSH, H2O2, forskolin, or MMI for 2 h. The expression of Prx I and Prx II mRNA was up-regulated by the addition of TSH, H2O2, or forskolin (Fig. 1 B). The expression of Prx I increased in the presence of MMI, but the expression of Prx II was not changed by this reagent (Fig. 1 B). The TSH-induced expression of Prx I and Prx II peaked within 2 h after the addition of TSH to FRTL-5 cells (data not shown). Prx I and Prx II protein expression was readily detected by Western blot of extracts from FRTL-5 cells (Fig.2 A, lane 1), and the level of Prx I protein increased and was maintained at a high level in the presence of TSH, H2O2 or MMI (Fig. 2 A, top panel, lanes 3–5). However, the level of Prx II protein did not increase in the presence of TSH, H2O2 or MMI (Fig. 2 A, middle panel). Iodide did not change the level of Prx I or Prx II protein expression (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). TSH stimulated the expression of Prx I maximally after approximately 4 h (Fig. 2 B, top panel, lane 1 versus lanes 5 and6), but it did not stimulate the expression of Prx II until 6 h of exposure (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that Prx I and Prx II are expressed in thyroid cells and that Prx I is up-regulated by TSH, H2O2, and MMI. H2O2 is produced by TSH in thyroid cells. The effect of Prx I and Prx II on this process was examined by transiently overexpressing mouse Prx I and II in FRTL-5 cells. Cells were co-transfected with a β-galactosidase reporter construct to normalize values and correct for differences in transfection efficiency. The intracellular concentration of H2O2 was monitored with the oxidation-sensitive fluorescent probe DCFH-DA and confocal microscopy (Fig.3 A). The addition of exogenous H2O2 increases the DCF fluorescence in these cells (data not shown). Similarly, DCF fluorescence rapidly increases after the addition of TSH to TSH-starved cells (Fig. 3). DCF fluorescence reached its maximal level within 10 min after TSH treatment (Fig. 3 B). This system monitors the intracellular concentration of H2O2 in cells under different conditions or in different cell lines. The following experiment was carried out with FRTL-5 cells transiently transfected with vector (pCR3.1) or expression plasmids for Prx I (pCRprx I) or Prx II (pCRprx II). As expected, TSH stimulated DCF fluorescence in cells with vector alone (Fig. 4). Interestingly, overexpression of Prx I or Prx II inhibited the TSH-induced increase in DCF fluorescence (Fig. 4, B and C). Enhanced expression of Prx I and Prx II after transfection were confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 4 A). These findings suggest that Prx I and Prx II are involved in the elimination of H2O2 produced by TSH in FRTL-5 cells.Figure 4Effect of Prx overexpression on TSH-induced H2O2 in FRTL-5 cells. FRTL-5 cells were cultured as described in the legend to Fig. 3 and transiently transfected with the indicated expression plasmids. The expression of Prx I and Prx II was measured by immunoblot analysis (A). After 3 days, DCF fluorescence was measured with a confocal microscope after incubation of the cells in the presence of TSH (1 milliunit/ml) for 5 min (B). Relative fluorescence intensity per cell was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data shown are means ± S.E. of the values from five groups of 20–30 cells (C). pCR 3.1 is the vector without an insert.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the above findings indicate that Prx I and Prx II are involved in eliminating H2O2 in thyroid cells, it seemed possible that Prx I and Prx II could inhibit H2O2-mediated apoptosis in thyroid cells. H2O2 (0.1–1 mm) induces apoptotic events in FRTL-5 cells without cycloheximide or actinomycin D (data not shown). FRTL-5 cells were transiently transfected with Prx I and Prx II expression vectors or the vector control plasmid and cultured for 24 h in 6H medium with 5% calf serum. Cells were transferred to 5H medium lacking serum and TSH for 36 h and treated with 500 μmH2O2 for 36 h. As shown in Fig.5 A, this treatment induces apoptosis in FRTL-5 cells transfected with the control plasmid pCR3.1 (Fig. 5 A, panel 2); about 60% of these cells were positive in the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, FRTL-5 cells overexpressing Prx I or Prx II were less apoptotic, and fewer cells were positive in the TUNEL assay (Fig. 5 B). Prx I and Prx II were approximately equally effective in inhibition of H2O2-mediated apoptosis (Fig.5 B). In a parallel experiment, expression of the proapoptotic proteins BAX and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was monitored by Western blot. Prx I- and Prx II-transfected cells were treated with 500 μm H2O2 for 36 h (Fig.6). FRTL-5 cells transfected with the control plasmid pCR3.1 expressed a very low level of BAX expression (Fig. 6, lane 1), which increased dramatically in cells treated with H2O2 (Fig. 6, lane 2). Expression of Prx I or Prx II significantly inhibited the expression of BAX after treatment with H2O2. These results suggest an antiapoptotic role for Prx I and Prx II in cells treated with H2O2. Further support for this idea was obtained by monitoring PARP cleavage after treating cells with H2O2. A small amount of the 85-kDa cleaved PARP fragment was present in FRTL-5 cells, which may be related to the serum starvation of these cells prior to treatment with H2O2. In cells transfected with the control vector, the level of uncleaved PARP was significantly reduced by treatment with H2O2. In contrast, expression of Prx I and Prx II inhibited PARP cleavage, so that a normal level of uncleaved PARP protein was maintained after treatment with H2O2. These findings support the suggestion that Prx I and Prx II protect thyroid cells against H2O2-induced apoptosis. This study provides evidence for two significant conclusions: 1) Prx I and Prx II are involved in eliminating H2O2 produced by thyroid cells in physiological response to TSH, and 2) Prx I and Prx II protect thyroid cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis. At present, at least six forms of Prx are known in mammalian cells (25.Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 219-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar,43.Knoops B.

Prx I and Prx II are cytosolic proteins with peroxidase activity (28.Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The recombinant forms of Prx I and Prx II reduce hydrogen peroxide using thioredoxin as electron donor (29.Netto L.E.S. Chae H.Z. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol.

In addition, Prx I and Prx II reduce H2O2 in cells stimulated with growth factors (31.Jin D.Y. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30952-30961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar) and inhibit activation of NF-κB by H2O2 or tumor necrosis factor-α (31.Jin D.Y. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G.

Chem. 1998; 273: 6297-6302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). These results indicate that Prx I and Prx II function as peroxidasesin vivo and may be components of signaling cascades for which H2O2 is an intracellular messenger (38.Kang S.W. Chae H.Z. Seo M.S.

Thyroid cells generate large amounts of H2O2 in response to TSH for synthesis of thyroid hormone (44.Carvalho D.P. Dupuy C. Gorin Y. Legue O. Pommier J. Haye B. Virion A. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 45.Corvilain B. van Sande J. Laurent E. Dumont J.E. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar); however, the mechanisms regulating the intracellular concentration of H2O2 are not well understood (46.Ekholm R. Bjorkman U. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2871-2878Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This report shows that Prx I and Prx II are constitutively expressed in many rat tissues, including the thyroid gland and in rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells (Figs. 1 and 2). In addition, Prx I is up-regulated by TSH in these cells. These results suggest that Prx proteins are involved in regulating intracellular H2O2 levels; for example, TSH-induced Prx I expression may be a mechanism for controlling the H2O2 generated in response to TSH. The mechanism by which TSH up-regulates Prx I expression is not yet known. It is possible that TSH-induced Prx I expression is a response to the increase in H2O2 level resulting from TSH-stimulation. Alternatively, transcription of Prx I and Prx II genes may be induced by activated redox-sensitive transcription factors (47.Carrero P. Okamoto K. Coumailleau P. O'Brien S. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar,48.Adler V. Yin Z. Tew K.D. Ronai Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6104-6111Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Prx II is expressed constitutively at a higher level than Prx I (Fig. 2), but Prx II protein is not induced by TSH (although its mRNA level is up-regulated by TSH). This result suggests that Prx II may eliminate cytosolic H2O2 constitutively in resting and TSH-stimulated thyroid cells. The mechanism by which H2O2 triggers apoptosis is not well understood (49.Migliaccio E. Giorgio M. Mele S. Pelicci G. Reboldi P. Pandolfi P.P. Lanfrancone L. Pelicci P.G. Nature. 1999; 402: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1479) Google Scholar, 50.von Harsdorf R. Li P.F. Dietz R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). However, H2O2and other reactive oxygen species induce apoptosis in many cell types (51.Vollgraf U. Wegner M. Richter-Landsberg C. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 2501-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 52.Madeo F. Frohlich E. Ligr M. Grey M. Sigrist S.J. Wolf D.H. Frohlich K.U. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25433-25438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). However, the physiological mechanisms that protect against apoptosis induced by reactive oxygen species are not clearly elucidated (54.Kamata H. Hirata H. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FRTL-5 cells that overexpress Prx I or Prx II are resistant to H2O2-mediated apoptosis. The number of cells that scored positive in the TUNEL assay for apoptosis decreased in Prx I- and Prx II-transfected FRTL-5 cells compared with control cells treated with 500 μm H2O2. In addition, the proapoptotic protein Bax was expressed in control cells treated with H2O2, but it was expressed at a lower level in cells expressing Prx I or Prx II (Fig. 6). At present, the mechanism by which Prx I and Prx II protect against H2O2-mediated apoptosis is unclear. However, it is likely that this effect is related to the ability of Prx proteins to eliminate intracellular H2O2 and other reactive oxygen species (55.Zhang P. Liu B. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Rhee S.G. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30615-30618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). TSH is involved in antiapoptotic processes in human (56.Feldkamp J. Pascher E. Perniok A. Scherbaum W.A. Horm. Metab. Res. 1999; 31: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and rat (57.Li X. Lu S. Miyagi E. Katoh R. Kawaoi A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5962-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) thyroid cells. This property of TSH may be mediated by decreasing P27 protein, increasing cyclin D expression, and promoting transition from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle (57.Li X. Lu S. Miyagi E. Katoh R. Kawaoi A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5962-5970Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The results presented here suggest another possible mechanism for this action of TSH; the antiapoptotic effects of TSH may involve its regulation of Prx I protein expression. Similarly, the antithyroid drugs MMI and propylthiouracil have been suggested as oxygen free radical scavengers (8.Imamura M. Aoki N. Saito T. Ohno Y. Maruyama Y. Yamaguchi J. Yamamoto T. Acta Endocrinol. 1986; 112: 210-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20.Balazs C. Kiss E. Leovey A. Farid N.R. Clin. Endocrinol. 1986; 25: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 23.Heufelder A.E. Wenzel B.E. Bahn R.S. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1992; 74: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that exposure of FRTL-5 cells to MMI enhances expression of Prx I (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that MMI-mediated radical scavenging may depend on its ability to stimulate expression of Prx I. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that two Prx isoforms, Prx I and Prx II, are involved in eliminating H2O2 in thyroid cells and in protecting these cells from H2O2-induced apoptosis. These observations are likely to be physiologically important because large amounts of H2O2 are produced in thyroid cells in response to TSH. Therefore, this study contributes to understanding of the mechanism for regulating intracellular H2O2 in the cells of the thyroid gland. We are grateful to Dr. Zee-Won Lee, Biomolecule Research Team, Korea Basic Science Institute (Taejon, South Korea) for the technical assistance in measuring intracellular H2O2 in thyroid cells."

Proteolytic cleavage of IGFBP-3 may regulate insulin-like growth factor bioavailability. IGFBP-3 is extensively degraded in serum during pregnancy; however, as yet the pregnancy-specific protease, or proteases, have not been identified. We utilized a yeast two-hybrid assay and a human placental cDNA library to investigate IGFBP-3-interacting proteins. A disintegrin and metalloprotease-12 (ADAM 12), a member of a family of metalloprotease disintegrins that is highly expressed in placental tissue, was identified as interacting with IGFBP-3. This interaction involved the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM 12. Unlike other members of this family of disintegrin metalloproteases that are membrane proteins, ADAM 12 exists as an alternatively spliced soluble secreted protein. To verify the interaction between ADAM 12 and IGFBP-3, an expression construct containing an ADAM 12-S cDNA was transfected into COS-1 cells. Co-precipitation was observed when conditioned medium was analyzed by immunoprecipitation with an antibody against either ADAM 12 or IGFBP-3 followed by Western blotting with anti-IGFBP-3 or anti-ADAM 12. Although minimal proteolysis of IGFBP-3 was observed in conditioned medium from control cells, this was increased ∼4-fold in conditioned medium from ADAM 12-S-transfected cells. Recombinant ADAM 12-S partially purified from conditioned medium on a heparin-Sepharose column also proteolyzed IGFBP-3. The degradation pattern was similar to that seen with pregnancy serum, and the presence of ADAM 12-S in serum during pregnancy was confirmed.

Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 49-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). This binding protein is present in serum as a complex of ∼150–200 kDa. This ternary complex is composed of IGF-I or IGF-II, an 85-kDa acid-labile subunit and IGFBP-3 (2.Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 49-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The ternary complex represents a relatively slowly turning over the reservoir of IGF, which is regulated largely by growth hormone. Both the acid-labile subunit and IGFBP-3 are growth hormone-dependent, either directly or via IGF-I (3.Ooi G.T. Hurst K.R. Poy M.N. Boisclair Y.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 675-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Zapf J. Hauri C. Waldvogel M. Futo E. Hasler H. Benz K. Guler H.P. Schmid C. Froesch E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Because IGFBP-3 has an affinity for IGF-I and -II comparable, or greater than, their receptors and is present in high concentrations in serum and biological fluids, the mechanism whereby IGF is liberated from this complex to interact with the respective membrane receptors is unclear at present. Proteolytic degradation of IGFBP-3 generates fragments with reduced binding affinity for IGF-I and consequently has been regarded as one potential mechanism whereby delivery of IGF-I to the receptor is facilitated (5.Kubler B. Cowell S. Zapf J. Braulke T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Bereket A. Lang C.H. Blethen S.L. Fan J. Frost R.A. Wilson T.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Endocrinol. 1991; 130: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Under normal circumstances the IGFBP-3 present in the plasma is largely intact, although some IGFBP-3 protease activity is detectable. In serum from pregnant women and to a lesser extent serum from poorly controlled diabetic patients and patients recovering from surgery or severe illness, much of the immunoreactive IGFBP-3 is present as smaller proteolytic fragments that have reduced binding affinity for IGF-I (5.Kubler B. Cowell S. Zapf J. Braulke T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6.Bereket A. Lang C.H. Blethen S.L. Fan J. Frost R.A. Wilson T.A. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Endocrinol. 1991; 130: 469-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). It is thought that this proteolytic degradation of IGFBP-3 enhances IGF-I and -II bioavailability in these situations. Evidence from size fractionation suggests that IGFBP-3 protease activity present in third trimester serum is likely to be because of more than one IGFBP-3 protease (8.Bang P. Fielder P.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 135: 3912-3917Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This IGFBP-3 protease activity disappears rapidly after parturition and is thought to arise from the placenta (5.Kubler B. Cowell S. Zapf J. Braulke T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Bang P. Fielder P.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 135: 3912-3917Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 protease activity has also been identified in a variety of other situations such as in conditioned medium from MCF-7 breast cancer cells (9.Salahifar H. Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), skin blister fluid (10.Xu S. Savage P. Burton J.L. Sansom J. Holly J.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

The relationship between each of these protease activities is not clear at this point in time. Partial purification of a major IGFBP-3 protease from late pregnant serum indicates that the protease also has activity against IGFBP-4 and -5, is present in fractions containing proteins of apparent molecular size of 50–100 kDa, and is a gelatinase-like protease that is recognized by an antidisintegrin domain antibody (5.Kubler B. Cowell S. Zapf J. Braulke T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This latter observation suggests that this protease may possibly be a soluble disintegrin metalloprotease, that is, a member of the ADAM family. Although this gelatinase-like protease appears to be the major IGFBP-3 protease present in pregnancy serum, there is evidence of other abundant proteases in sera from pregnant women that have slightly different specificity (8.Bang P. Fielder P.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 135: 3912-3917Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We utilized a yeast two-hybrid system to identified placental proteins that interact with IGFBP-3. ADAM 12-S, a secreted disintegrin metalloprotease, was identified (12.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Furthermore our results suggest that IGFBP-3 is a substrate for ADAM 12-S proteolytic activity. The plasmid, pBluescript/human IGFBP-3, containing a 2.4-kb full-length human IGFBP-3 cDNA was digested with HindIII. The 1.9-kbHindIII fragment was recovered and cut with AvaI, resulting in a 1.0-kb fragment containing a sequence encoding 30–264-amino acid residues with a 27-amino acid signal sequence deleted. The AvaI fragment was blunted with klenow enzyme, and ligated into the blunted BamHI site of vector pAS1 of the yeast two-hybrid system, resulting in a in-frame fusion of human IGFBP-3 cDNA downstream of GAL4 DNA binding domain. The correct in-frame sequence was verified by sequence analysis. The expression of the fusion protein with molecular mass of 48 kDa was confirmed by Western blot in the yeast cell strain CG1945 transfected with this construct. A human placental cDNA library in the pACT2 plasmid (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was screened with the human IGFBP-3 bait construct pAS1/hBP-3 using the large scale sequential polyethylene glycol/lithium acetate transformation method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Yeast cells of the CG-1945 strain containing pAS1/hBP-3 were transformed with 20–40 μg of library DNA/transformation. The transformed cells were spread on 40 SD/-Trp-Leu-His plates containing 5 mm3-amino-1,24-triazole and incubated 5 days at 30 °C. Plasmid DNAs were extracted from yeast cells cultured in SD/Trp-Leu-His/3-amino-1,24-triazole medium. Separating the pAS1/BP-3 plasmid from the AD/library plasmid, and selecting AD/library plasmids was carried out by transformation of Escherichia coli HB101 carrying a leuB mutation and plating cells on M9 agar medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 40 μg/ml proline, and 1 mmthiamine-HC1. The plasmids were analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion and polymerase chain reaction. The interaction of IGFBP-3 with the positive cDNA clones was verified by mating yeast. Yeast Y187 cells were transformed with pAS1/BP-3 and the yeast CG/1945 cells were transformed with AD-positive plasmids prepared from E. coli HB101. These two yeast cells were mated and plated on SD/Trp-Leu-His/5 mm3-amino-1,24-triazole medium. Plasmids were sequenced on an ABI automated DNA sequencer with a dye terminator kit (ABI, Foster City, CA), and a comparison of the DNA sequence with those in sequences in GenBankTM was done using the BLAST search and Antheprot software. The pACT2/ADAM 12-S plasmid identified in the yeast-two hybrid assay contains a 1.5-kb insert and includes 0.8 kb of the 3′-untranslated region of ADAM 12-S. Three in-frame deletion constructs were generated using polymerase chain reaction with the following primer: 5′-CGGAATTCAAGGAGGTGCCAGC-3′, 5′-CGGAATTCAAAATATTAGTGTCT-3′, 5′ACGAATTCCCATCCGGCAAGCAG-3′, and the reverse primer 5′-GTTGAAGTGAACTTGCGGGG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into the EcoRI/Xho1 site of the pACT2 vector, and the open-reading frame of the fusion protein was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Yeast Y187 cells were co-transfected with pAS1/hBP3 and the various deletion constructs of pACT2/ADAM 12-S and grown on SD/Trp-Leu plates. The interaction of BP-3 with the various ADAM 12-S domains was determined by the detection of β-galactosidase activity using a chemiluminescent detection kit (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Biotinylated goat anti-human IGFBP-3 antibody was obtained from Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX. The rabbit ADAM 12 antibody, rb 119, was raised against the disintegrin domain of ADAM 12, amino acids 411–557 (13.Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M-G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The rb 122 antibody was raised in rabbits against the cysteine-rich domain and is equivalent to the rb 104 antibody described previously (13.Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M-G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A rat monoclonal antibody 14E3 was raised against a 17-kDa recombinant protein containing the cysteine-rich domain of ADAM 12-S (13.Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M-G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R.

An expression construct containing a full-length human ADAM 12-S cDNA (GenBankTM accession number AF023477 (12.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol.

After 24 h the transfected cells were washed twice with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cultured for a further 48 h. The conditioned medium was centrifuged at 1100 x gfor 10 min, and the supernatant was concentrated 10-fold using an Amicon Centricon-10 filter. For immunoprecipitation, 50 μl of protein-A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was washed with 0.05m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C with 5 μl of anti-human IGFBP-3, anti-ADAM 12, or nonimmune rabbit serum in a 50-μl total volume. The complexes were centrifuged, washed, and incubated at 4 °C overnight with 100 μl of the conditioned medium to which 100 ng of IGFBP-3 (Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) was added. The mixture was centrifuged and washed four times. The resulting pellet was mixed with 50 μl of Laemmli buffer, boiled for 5 min, and vortexed. Samples were centrifuged briefly, and the supernatants were subsequently analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with anti-ADAM 12 antibody or anti-IGFBP-3 antibody at 4 °C overnight and then with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Life Technologies, Inc.). Detection was performed using an ECL Western blotting detection kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The ADAM 12-S cDNA was cloned in between the PvuII and NotI sites of the expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The 293-EBNA cell line (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was transfected with this expression plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with Glutamax I and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to select for cells carrying the expression plasmid. For partial purification of the ADAM 12-S protein, cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium, and the conditioned medium was diluted with two volumes of 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and subjected to chromatography on a HiTrap Heparin column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Elution was performed with a 50–300 mm NaCl gradient in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 0.2% CHAPS. Fractions containing the ADAM 12-S protein were identified by Western blotting. Corresponding fractions from chromatography of medium from untransfected 293-EBNA cells served as a negative control. The IGFBP-3 protease activity was assessed as described previously (9.Salahifar H. Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Samples were incubated with recombinant human IGFBP-3 in the buffer containing 100 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mmCaCl2, and 0.02% sodium azide for 16 h at 37 °C except in the case of the heparin-Sepharose-purified fractions where the buffer contained 50 mm PIPES (pH 7.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% CHAPS, 2 mm CaCl2, and 1 μm ZnCl2 unless otherwise stated. Subsequently, the samples were subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions, and the proteolytic fragments were detected by Western blot as described above. Serum from normal nonpregnant women and women in the third trimester of pregnancy was obtained with informed consent by Dr. J. McCoshen, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Manitoba and by Dr. J. Bock, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University Hospital of Copenhagen, Denmark. The heparin-Sepharose fraction of conditioned medium from 293-EBNA transfected with the ADAM 12-S cDNA was stripped of divalent cations by incubation with 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm 1,10-phenanthroline. After 10 min at 20 °C the chelating reagents were removed using a MicroSpin G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The result fraction was tested in the IGFBP-3 protease assay in the presence and absence of 2 mmCaCl2 and 1 μm ZnCl2. A total of 5 × 106 tryptophan and leucine auxotrophic transformants were screened resulting in the identification of 53 positive colonies. Three colonies were chosen at random for further study. The plasmids were rescued from these colonies, expanded inE. coli, and re-introduced into yeast cells to confirm the interaction with the pAS1/hBP-3 bait plasmid. The inserts present in the three AD-positive plasmids were sequenced and found to be identical to the previously reported sequence of human TAP1 (14.Alpan R.S. Zhang M. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 4358-4361PubMed Google Scholar), fibronectin (15.Globus R.K. Doty S.B. Lull J.C. Holmuhamedov E. Humphries M.J. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and ADAM 12 also known as meltrin α (GenBankTMaccession number AF023477 (12.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar)). Because ADAM 12 is an active metalloprotease (12.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and highly expressed in placenta (13.Gilpin B.J. Loechel F. Mattei M-G. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 157-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), we chose to examine the interaction of ADAM 12 and IGFBP-3 in detail. The GAL4-DNA activation domain fusion protein identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen contains the ADAM 12 sequence starting at amino acid number 546, that is, downstream of the disintegrin domain and upstream of the fusion peptide-like sequence in the cysteine-rich domain (Fig.1). The clone identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen contained a 1.5-kb insert including 0.8-kb 3′-untranslated sequence. Sequence information derived from the 3′-end of the insert indicated that the cDNA sequence was that of ADAM 12-S, lacking the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail that is present in the long form, ADAM 12-L. In frame 5′-deletions were made using polymerase chain reaction and the mutant clones tested for interaction in the yeast system. Deletion of amino acids 546–619 reduced the expression of β-galactosidase by ∼10-fold (Fig. 1). Deletion of a further 60 amino acid residues reduced β-galactosidase activity to baseline. Sera from nonpregnant and pregnant women were analyzed by immunoblot using polyclonal rabbit serum and monoclonal antibody generated against ADAM 12. ADAM 12-S was not detected in serum from nonpregnant women, whereas the 68-kDa protease was easily detected with either antibody in serum from a pregnant women (Fig. 2). An immunoreactive band of ∼250 kDa was also apparent with both antibodies and may represent ADAM 12-S complexed to larger proteins such as α2-macroglobulin (12.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To confirm the interaction of ADAM 12 with IGFBP-3, COS-1 cells were transfected with an expression vector containing a full-length ADAM 12-S cDNA (12.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Expression of recombinant ADAM 12-S in COS-1 cells was confirmed by Western blotting using antisera raised against ADAM 12 (13). Although both the 96-kDa proenzyme and the mature 68-kDa protease were observed in conditioned medium, the 68-kDa form predominated (data not shown). Although COS-1 express IGFBP-3 at a low level, additional exogenous human IGFBP-3 was added to demonstrate interaction with ADAM 12. Immunoprecipitation with antibody against IGFBP-3-precipitated ADAM 12 from conditioned medium (Fig. 3,lane 1). In immunoprecipitates from conditioned medium from ADAM 12-S-transfected cells, four bands were apparent, the 92- and 68-kDa forms of ADAM 12-S and a faint slowly migrating band and a prominent band with an apparent size of 50 kDa. We assume that these bands correspond to the immunoglobulin fragments, because they are present in immunoprecipitates of conditioned medium from vector-transfected cells (lane 2). Both the 92- and 68-kDa forms of ADAM 12-S were observed in the immunoprecipitates; however, because of the relatively higher abundance of the 68-kDa form of ADAM 12-S in conditioned medium, this form predominated in the immunoprecipitates. The specificity of these immunoreactive bands was confirmed by the absence in conditioned medium from COS-1 cells transfected with the empty vector. Only the immunoglobulin-derived bands were apparent in the immunoprecipitates of the control conditioned medium (Fig. 3, lane 2). Furthermore protein A-Sepharose beads coated with normal rabbit serum did not precipitate ADAM 12-S (Fig. 3, lane 4). A complementary experiment was performed to confirm the interaction. In this case conditioned medium from ADAM 12-S-transfected cells together with conditioned medium from control cells were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with antibody to ADAM 12-S, and the IGFBP-3 present in the immunoprecipitates was identified by immunoblotting with antibody to IGFBP-3 (Fig.4). IGFBP-3 was easily identified in the anti-ADAM 12 immunoprecipitates from ADAM 12-S-transfected cells but was not observed when nonimmune normal rabbit serum was used (Fig. 4,lane 1 compared with lane 3). In these experiments, a biotinylated anti-IGFBP-3 antibody was used together with a streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate, and consequently the immunoglobulin bands are not apparent. A very weak IGFBP-3 band was observed when conditioned medium from control cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody to ADAM 12 and normal rabbit serum (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 4) and also in conditioned medium from ADAM 12-S-transfected cells immunoprecipitated with normal rabbit serum (Fig. 4, lane 3). This most probably reflects residual, nonspecifically bound IGFBP-3 not completely removed during the washing steps.Figure 4Immunoblot analysis of immunoprecipitates of ADAM 12-S cDNA and vector transfected cells. 25 ng of recombinant IGFBP-3 was added to conditioned medium (CM) and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads coated with anti-ADAM 12 antiserum or normal rabbit serum. After gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, IGFBP-3 was revealed using a biotinylated goat anti-IGFBP-3 antibody and chemiluminescence.

Although the endogenous IGFBP-3 secreted by the COS-1 cells was largely intact in ADAM 12-S containing conditioned medium, the 30-and 19-kDa IGFBP-3 proteolytic fragments were easily seen. Whereas in conditioned medium from control cells only a small amount of the 30-kDa fragment was observed (Fig.5). Because this IGFBP-3 proteolysis could have occurred at the cell membrane rather than in the conditioned medium, we tested the ability of the conditioned medium to degrade IGFBP-3 in the absence of the cell monolayer. For these experiments recombinant IGFBP-3 was incubated with control or ADAM 12-S containing conditioned medium. As a positive control human third trimester pregnancy serum was included in the analysis. Proteolytic degradation of IGFBP-3 was apparent with conditioned medium from the COS-1 cell transfected with ADAM 12-S but not with conditioned medium from cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 6 A, lane 4 and 5 compared with lane 7). The major immunoreactive proteolytic fragments of IGFBP-3 generated by the ADAM 12-S containing conditioned medium had similar apparent molecular masses, ∼30 and 19 kDa, as that apparent in human pregnancy serum (Fig. 6, lane 3). The time course of proteolytic degradation is shown in Fig.7. A small amount of degraded IGFBP-3 was apparent in the zero time sample possibly as a result of degradation of endogenously expressed IGFBP-3 or because of some minimal degradation of exogenous IGFBP-3 that occurs during the storage of this sample of −20 °C for the 24-h period. In samples incubated at 37 °C there was a time-dependent increase in the amount of IGFBP-3 degraded. However even after 24 h the majority of the IGFBP-3 remained intact. When the immunoreactive bands were analyzed by densitometry, the ratio of the sum of 17- and 30-kDa IGFBP-3 fragment to intact IGFBP-3 increased from 0.001 to 0.258. The ADAM 12-S was partially purified from COS-1 and 293-EBNA cell-conditioned medium by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The heparin-Sepharose fraction from transfected cells was devoid of any endogenous IGFBP-3 (Fig. 8 A,lane 4) had marked protease activity against IGFBP-3, whereas no activity was apparent in the heparin-Sepharose fraction of conditioned medium from untransfected cells (Fig. 8). The proteolytic activity of the ADAM 12-S-containing heparin-Sepharose fraction was partially inhibited by EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline (Fig.8 A). To investigate the effect of divalent cations further, the partially purified ADAM 12-S was preincubated with EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline and then excess EDTA and 1,10-phenanthroline was removed by Sephadex G25 chromatography. In the absence of divalent cations, the resulting ADAM 12-S containing fraction was without activity against IGFBP-3 (Fig. 8 B, lane 4). However, this fraction had full activity in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 and 1 μmZnCl2 (Fig. 8 B, lane 5). Utilizing the yeast two-hybrid system and IGFBP-3 as a bait, we identified ADAM 12, TAP1, and fibronectin cDNAs in a human placental library. TAP1 is a member of the ABC transporter superfamily and is associated with the export of proteins from the cytosol to the endoplasmic reticulum lumen (16.Elliott T. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 47-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional significance of the association between TAP1 and IGFBP-3 is unclear, and no attempt as yet has been made to confirm this interaction in mammalian cells. Although no direct interaction between IGFBP-3 and fibronectin has been reported, the closely related binding protein, IGFBP-5, binds to fibronectin (17.Jones J.I. Gockerman A. Busby W.H. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 121: 679-687Crossref Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that IGFBP-3 also interacts with fibronectin. We chose to examine the interaction between ADAM 12 and IGFBP-3 in further detail because a component of the IGFBP-3 protease activity in pregnancy serum appears to be because of metalloprotease (5.Kubler B. Cowell S. Zapf J. Braulke T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Bang P. Fielder P.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 135: 3912-3917Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). ADAM 12, also known as meltrin α, is a member of a large family of disintegrin metalloproteases that are widely distributed and developmentally regulated and conserved across species (18.Wolfsberg T.G. Straight P.D. Gerena R.L. Huovila A-P.J. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). They are usually membrane-anchored proteins that serve multiple functions including cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion as well as proteolysis (18.Wolfsberg T.G. Straight P.D. Gerena R.L. Huovila A-P.J. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). These disintegrin metalloproteases are involved in a diverse array of physiological processes including lymphocyte adhesion, wound healing, hemostasis, sperm attachment, invasion, and metastasis (18.Wolfsberg T.G. Straight P.D. Gerena R.L. Huovila A-P.J. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. Dev. Biol. 1995; 169: 378-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). ADAM 12 is abundantly expressed in the human placenta (12.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In addition to the membrane-bound form or long form of this protein, ADAM 12-L, an alternatively spliced secreted form is expressed in the placenta (12.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). ADAM 12-S differs from ADAM 12-L at the C-terminal end, is devoid of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, and as demonstrated here is present in the maternal circulation. ADAM 12-S, which is not active in its 96-kDa form, contains a prodomain at the N terminus, upstream of a furin cleavage site. Removal of the prodomain converts ADAM 12-S into a ∼68-kDa active zinc-dependent metalloprotease (12.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Downstream of the metalloprotease domain is the disintegrin domain followed by a cysteine-rich domain. The GAL4-DNA binding domain fusion protein identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen contains the ADAM 12-S sequence starting at amino acid number 546, that is, downstream of the disintegrin domain and within the cysteine-rich domain. By deletion analysis we determine that IGFBP-3 interacts with the proximal part of the region from residue 546 to 679. This sequence is also present in the extracellular region of the membrane-bound form ADAM 12-L. When a full-length ADAM 12-S was expressed in the COS-1 or 293-EBNA cells both the 92- and 68-kDa forms were apparent indicating that these cells express furin or a similar protease capable of activating the ADAM 12-S proenzyme. Interestingly, lower amounts of endogenous intact IGFBP-3 and correspondingly more IGFBP-3 degradation products were observed in cells transfected with the ADAM 12-S expression vector than the empty vector. Interaction of ADAM 12-S with IGFBP-3 was confirmed in the mammalian cell system by reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. It is also likely, although as yet unproven, that IGFBP-3 also interacts with the membrane-bound ADAM 12-L. Thus it is possible that the membrane bound form, ADAM 12-L, may be responsible for one, or another, of the IGFBP-3 membrane binding sites previously identified in various cell lines (19.Oh Y. Muller H.L Pham H. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26045-26048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Rajah R. Valentinis B. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12181-12188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The majority of the IGF binding capacity in rodent and human serum is attributable to IGFBP-3 (1.Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 49-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). This binding protein is present in a ternary complex of ∼150 kDa, composed of IGF-I or IGF-II, an 85-kDa acid-labile subunit, and IGFBP-3 (1.Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 3-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It represents a relatively slowly turning over reservoir of IGF (21.Guler H.P. Zapf J. Schmid C. Froesch E.R. Acta Endocrinol. 1989; 121: 753-758Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because IGFBP-3 has an affinity for IGF-I and -II comparable or greater than their receptors and is present in high concentrations in serum and biological fluids, the mechanism whereby IGF is liberated from this complex to interact with the respective membrane receptors is unclear at present. Proteolytic degradation of IGFBP-3 generates fragments with reduced binding affinity for IGF-I and consequently may be one mechanism whereby delivery of IGF-I to the receptor is facilitated. Under normal circumstances the IGFBP-3 present in the plasma is largely intact, although some IGFBP-3 protease activity is detectable. In serum from pregnant women and to a lesser extent serum from poorly controlled diabetic patients and patients recovering from surgery or severe illness, a variable proportion of the immunoreactive IGFBP-3 is present as smaller proteolytic fragments. It is thought that this proteolytic degradation of IGFBP-3 enhances IGF-I and -II bioavailability in these situations. Evidence from size fractionation of serum from late pregnancy suggests that IGFBP-3 protease activity is likely to be because of more than one IGFBP-3 proteases (8.Bang P. Fielder P.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 135: 3912-3917Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). IGFBP-3 protease activity largely disappears after parturition suggesting that much of IGFBP-3 protease arises from the placenta, decidual tissue, or trophoblasts (8.Bang P. Fielder P.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 135: 3912-3917Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 22.Sakai K. Iwashita M. Takeda Y. Endocrinol. J. 1997; 44: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23.Irwin J.C. Suen L.-F. Cheng B.-H. Martin R. Cannon P. Deal C.L. Giudice L.C. Endocrinology. 1999; 141: 666-674Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In late pregnancy serum, protease activity directed against IGFBP-3 is present in fractions containing proteins of 50–100 kDa (5.Kubler B. Cowell S. Zapf J. Braulke T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zymography indicates that the major IGFBP-3 protease activity is because of a gelatinase-like protease that is recognized by an antidisintegrin domain antibody (5.Kubler B. Cowell S. Zapf J. Braulke T. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1556-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This latter observation would suggest that this protease was likely to be a soluble disintegrin metalloprotease, and as such ADAM 12-S, which is highly expressed in the placenta and present in serum from pregnant women, is a possible candidate. ADAM 12-S was not detectable by Western blotting in serum from nonpregnant women. In addition to demonstrating the interaction of IGFBP-3 and ADAM 12-S, we provide evidence that IGFBP-3 is a substrate for ADAM 12-S. Conditioned medium from cells transfected with ADAM 12-S cDNA when incubated with excess recombinant IGFBP-3 resulted in the generation of IGFBP-3 fragments similar to that seen in late pregnancy serum. This was not the case with conditioned medium from cells transfected with the empty vector. Furthermore, the concentration of intact IGFBP-3 in conditioned medium COS-1 cells, as determined by Western blotting, was less than that in conditioned medium from vector-transfected cells. Although a number of mechanisms may be responsible for this reduction in IGFBP-3 concentration in conditioned medium from ADAM 12-S-expressing cells, it is likely that enhanced proteolysis and degradation of IGFBP-3 is at least partly responsible. Despite the reduced amount of endogenous IGFBP-3 in ADAM 12-S containing conditioned medium, the smaller molecular weight IGFBP-3 fragments were more abundant suggesting that degradation of endogenously expressed IGFBP-3 in COS-1 cells was enhanced by overexpression of ADAM 12-S in these cells. Using heparin-Sepharose, we were able to partially purify the ADAM 12-S from conditioned medium of COS-1 and 293-EBNA cells and show that this fraction had IGFBP-3 protease activity. In contrast the equivalent heparin-Sepharose fraction from conditioned medium from untransfected cells had no activity. Furthermore the protease activity of the partially ADAM 12-S fraction was inhibited by EDTA and 1,10 phenanthroline. ADAM 12-S has previously been shown to bind to heparin-Sepharose and to be a zinc-dependent metalloprotease (12.Loechel F. Gilpin B.J. Engvall E. Albrechtsen R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16993-16997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These data provide evidence that ADAM 12-S is able to interact with IGFBP-3, and the interaction results in proteolysis of IGFBP-3. ADAM 12-S may represent only one of the components of circulating IGFBP-3 protease activity present in pregnancy serum, because the evidence suggests that additional proteases are present in this situation (8.Bang P. Fielder P.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 135: 3912-3917Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined what the relative contribution of ADAM 12-S is to the total IGFBP-3 protease activity present in pregnancy serum. The interaction of IGFBP-3 with ADAM 12-S reported here raises the possibility that IGFBP-3 may also interact with the membrane-bound ADAM 12-L. Further studies are required to determine whether IGFBP-3 interacts with ADAM 12-L."
https://openalex.org/W2129567613,"Big mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (BMK1), a member of the mammalian MAP kinase family, is activated by growth factors. The activation of BMK1 is required for growth factor-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. We have previously shown that BMK1 regulates c-jun gene expression through direct phosphorylation and activation of transcription factor MEF2C. MEF2C belongs to the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) protein family, a four-membered family of transcription factors denoted MEF2A, -2B, -2C, and -2D. Here, we demonstrate that, in addition to MEF2C, BMK1 phosphorylates and activates MEF2A and MEF2D but not MEF2B. The blocking of BMK1 signaling inhibits the epidermal growth factor-dependent activation of these three MEF2 transcription factors. The sites phosphorylated by activated BMK1 were mapped to Ser-355, Thr-312, and Thr-319 of MEF2A and Ser-179 of MEF2D both in vitro and in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis reveals that the phosphorylation of these sites in MEF2A and MEF2D are necessary for the induction of MEF2A and 2D transactivating activity by either BMK1 or by epidermal growth factor. Taken together, these data demonstrate that, upon growth factor induction, BMK1 directly phosphorylates and activates three members of the MEF2 family of transcription factors thereby inducing MEF2-dependent gene expression.

In mammalian cells, four families of MAP kinases have been identified, including the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 kinase, and big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1/ERK5). Each MAP kinase family is regulated by a distinct signal transduction mechanism that influences specific cellular functions, including cell growth, cell differentiation, programmed cell death, neoplastic transformation, and certain stress-related responses (1.Cobb M.H.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). For example, MAP kinases have been shown to regulate the activity of c-Jun, CHOP10, c-Myc, ternary complex factor, and MEF2 transcription factors (9.Gupta S. Davis R.J.

Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). MEF2 transcription factors bind as homodimers and heterodimers to MEF2 sites found within the promoters of numerous genes, including muscle-specific genes and the proto-oncogene c-jun (14.Martin J.F.

Biol. 1998; 14: 167-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these four MEF2 proteins exhibit amino acid sequence similarity within their DNA binding and transactivating domains (16.Olson E.N. Perry M. Schulz R.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar).BMK1, a newer member of the MAP kinase family, was cloned by us and others using distinct approaches (17.Lee J.-D. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 37.Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12665-12669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that BMK1 is activated by growth factors, oxidative stress, and hyperosmolarity and that BMK1 activity is required for growth factor-induced cell cycle progression through S phase (18.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 19.Abe J.I. Kushuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.-D. J. Biol.

Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Transcription factor MEF2C is a direct substrate for BMK1, and its phosphorylation by BMK1 is involved in serum-induced proto-oncogene c-jun expression via the MEF2 site found within c-jun promoter (18.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). However, the effect of the BMK1 signaling pathway on other MEF2 family members has not yet been explored. In this study, we have investigated the regulation of MEF2A, -2B, and -2D proteins by BMK1. We found that, in addition to MEF2C, BMK1 can specifically phosphorylate and activate MEF2A and -2D but not -2B. The BMK1 phosphorylation sites within MEF2A and MEF2D were subsequently identified both in vivo and in vitro and shown to be critical for both BMK1 and growth factor-mediated activation of these transcription factors.DISCUSSIONThe MEF2 family members, along with certain specific splice variants, were originally described as muscle-specific DNA binding proteins that recognize MEF2 motifs found within the promoters of many muscle-specific genes (14.Martin J.F. Miano J.M. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 26.Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Recently, however, several groups have reported MEF2 binding activity and MEF2 proteins in a wide variety of cell types where these proteins appear to play an important role in growth factor- and stress stimulus-induced early gene responses (13.Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.T. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar,18.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 22.Han T.-H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the expression and function of MEF2 transcription factors is broader than originally thought. All four MEF2 family members can bind MEF2 promoter elements as either homodimers or a combination of heterodimers. Our laboratory has previously determined that BMK1 can modulate MEF2C activity induced by growth factors (18.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 20.Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Herein, the effect of BMK1 on other MEF2 family members was investigated, and we found that, in addition to MEF2C, the transcriptional activity of MEF2A and -2D is also directly up-regulated by BMK1-catalyzed phosphorylation. Nonetheless, the biological consequence of BMK1-mediated activation of MEF2 proteins in various cell types and tissues is still largely unknown and needs to be explored.MEF2A, -2C, and -2D in MEF2 family share amino acid sequence similarity within their transactivating domains, and, in this paper, we have demonstrated that their activity can be modulated by the phosphorylation of these domains by BMK1. Interestingly, our findings, combined with our previous report (18.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), suggest that the MEF2 sites phosphorylated by BMK1 are not conserved with respect to each other (Fig. 10). These results indicate that the general structural similarity among MEF2 proteins may only contribute to their initial recognition/interaction with BMK1 but that the actual site phosphorylated by BMK1 is determined by other factors. One possibility is that different cellular cofactors orient the kinase domain of BMK1 with different phosphorylation sites of these three MEF proteins. Another possibility is that the more subtle variations in the amino acid sequences of each of the MEFs contribute to the precise site phosphorylated by BMK1.The MAP kinase p38 has also been shown to regulate the activity of MEF2A and MEF2C (13.Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.T. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 21.Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V. Kato Y. Gram H. di Padova F. Olson E.N. Ulevitch R.J. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 27.Yang S.H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this regard, a conserved p38-docking domain was found in both MEF2A and MEF2C. In comparison, the docking domain of MEF2D is significantly different and has been considered inaccessible by p38 (27.Yang S.H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We have shown that BMK1 can interact with all three of the aforementioned MEF proteins Thus, the recognition and interaction of BMK1 with MEF family members may to be less stringent than that of p38. The other possibility is that BMK1 recognizes domains in these MEFs distinct from that utilized by p38. Moreover, BMK1 has been shown to physically interact with amino acids found within the DNA binding domain of MEF2A and MEF2C (28.Yang C.C. Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. Cruz T.F. Prody C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4771-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences or existence of this association in MEF2D have not yet been explored. It appears unlikely that this function of p38 acts in concert with BMK1 in the induction of c-jun expression, as the agonists for p38 are largely activators of stress and inflammation and are not mitogenic in nature (13.Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.T. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 29.Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. David R.J. J.

Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar).In collaboration with B. C. Berk's laboratory, we have previously shown BMK1 is strongly activated by oxidative stress in smooth muscle cells and by shear stress in endothelial cells (19.Abe J.I. Kushuhara M. Ulevitch R.J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 143-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MEF2 proteins are expressed in these cell types where they have been shown to be involved in vascular development (33.Lin Q. Lu J. Yanagisawa H. Webb R. Lyons G.E. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1998; 125: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Bi W. Drake C.J. Schwarz J.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, a possible role for BMK1 in endothelial cell organization and smooth muscle cell differentiation warrants investigation. In addition, because these MEF2 proteins are critical in regulating muscle-specific gene expression, it is worthy to determine if BMK1-mediated signaling is involved in the MEF2-dependent differentiation or proliferation of muscle cells during development.The proto-oncogene c-jun is an immediate early gene expressed in quiescent cells in response to mitogens such as growth factors. The induction of c-jun expression, mediated by mitogens or by signals from G protein-coupled receptors, requires ATF1 (AP-1 like) and MEF2 sites in the promoter of this gene (24.Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35.Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that a MEF2 promoter element is required for the BMK1-mediated activation of c-jun expression as deletion of this element completely abrogates this effect (Fig. 8 a). The induction of c-jun expression appears to be essential for cell proliferation as microinjection of a deactivating anti-c-jun antibody has been shown to abrogate serum-induced cell cycle progression (36.Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4466-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies in our laboratory have established that BMK1 activity is required for mitogen-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (20.Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the requirement for BMK1 in mitogen-induced cell cycle progression may be due to its ability to activate MEF transcription factors and thereby induce c-jun expression. As the ras/rac/MEKK1 signal transduction pathway has also been implicated in EGF-induced c-jun expression (24.Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine if this pathway, along with that provided by BMK1, mediates synergistic effects on c-jun activation. Mitogen-activated protein (MAP)1 kinase signal transduction pathways constitute one of the major mechanisms by which extracellular stimuli are converted into specific nuclear responses (1.Cobb M.H. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 479-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 2.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol.

In mammalian cells, four families of MAP kinases have been identified, including the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2), c-Jun N-terminal kinase, p38 kinase, and big MAP kinase 1 (BMK1/ERK5). Each MAP kinase family is regulated by a distinct signal transduction mechanism that influences specific cellular functions, including cell growth, cell differentiation, programmed cell death, neoplastic transformation, and certain stress-related responses (1.Cobb M.H.

Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). For example, MAP kinases have been shown to regulate the activity of c-Jun, CHOP10, c-Myc, ternary complex factor, and MEF2 transcription factors (9.Gupta S. Davis R.J.

MEF2 transcription factors bind as homodimers and heterodimers to MEF2 sites found within the promoters of numerous genes, including muscle-specific genes and the proto-oncogene c-jun (14.Martin J.F.

Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). However, the effect of the BMK1 signaling pathway on other MEF2 family members has not yet been explored. In this study, we have investigated the regulation of MEF2A, -2B, and -2D proteins by BMK1. We found that, in addition to MEF2C, BMK1 can specifically phosphorylate and activate MEF2A and -2D but not -2B. The BMK1 phosphorylation sites within MEF2A and MEF2D were subsequently identified both in vivo and in vitro and shown to be critical for both BMK1 and growth factor-mediated activation of these transcription factors. DISCUSSIONThe MEF2 family members, along with certain specific splice variants, were originally described as muscle-specific DNA binding proteins that recognize MEF2 motifs found within the promoters of many muscle-specific genes (14.Martin J.F. Miano J.M. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 26.Yu Y.T. Breitbart R.E. Smoot L.B. Lee Y. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1783-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Recently, however, several groups have reported MEF2 binding activity and MEF2 proteins in a wide variety of cell types where these proteins appear to play an important role in growth factor- and stress stimulus-induced early gene responses (13.Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.T. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar,18.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 22.Han T.-H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the expression and function of MEF2 transcription factors is broader than originally thought. All four MEF2 family members can bind MEF2 promoter elements as either homodimers or a combination of heterodimers. Our laboratory has previously determined that BMK1 can modulate MEF2C activity induced by growth factors (18.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 20.Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Herein, the effect of BMK1 on other MEF2 family members was investigated, and we found that, in addition to MEF2C, the transcriptional activity of MEF2A and -2D is also directly up-regulated by BMK1-catalyzed phosphorylation. Nonetheless, the biological consequence of BMK1-mediated activation of MEF2 proteins in various cell types and tissues is still largely unknown and needs to be explored.MEF2A, -2C, and -2D in MEF2 family share amino acid sequence similarity within their transactivating domains, and, in this paper, we have demonstrated that their activity can be modulated by the phosphorylation of these domains by BMK1. Interestingly, our findings, combined with our previous report (18.Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), suggest that the MEF2 sites phosphorylated by BMK1 are not conserved with respect to each other (Fig. 10). These results indicate that the general structural similarity among MEF2 proteins may only contribute to their initial recognition/interaction with BMK1 but that the actual site phosphorylated by BMK1 is determined by other factors. One possibility is that different cellular cofactors orient the kinase domain of BMK1 with different phosphorylation sites of these three MEF proteins. Another possibility is that the more subtle variations in the amino acid sequences of each of the MEFs contribute to the precise site phosphorylated by BMK1.The MAP kinase p38 has also been shown to regulate the activity of MEF2A and MEF2C (13.Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.T. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 21.Zhao M. New L. Kravchenko V.V. Kato Y. Gram H. di Padova F. Olson E.N.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this regard, a conserved p38-docking domain was found in both MEF2A and MEF2C. In comparison, the docking domain of MEF2D is significantly different and has been considered inaccessible by p38 (27.Yang S.H. Galanis A. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4028-4038Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We have shown that BMK1 can interact with all three of the aforementioned MEF proteins Thus, the recognition and interaction of BMK1 with MEF family members may to be less stringent than that of p38. The other possibility is that BMK1 recognizes domains in these MEFs distinct from that utilized by p38. Moreover, BMK1 has been shown to physically interact with amino acids found within the DNA binding domain of MEF2A and MEF2C (28.Yang C.C. Ornatsky O.I. McDermott J.C. Cruz T.F. Prody C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 4771-4777Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the functional consequences or existence of this association in MEF2D have not yet been explored. It appears unlikely that this function of p38 acts in concert with BMK1 in the induction of c-jun expression, as the agonists for p38 are largely activators of stress and inflammation and are not mitogenic in nature (13.Han J. Jiang Y. Li Z. Kravchenko V.V. Ulevitch R.T. Nature. 1997; 386: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 29.Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. David R.J. J.

Berk's laboratory, we have previously shown BMK1 is strongly activated by oxidative stress in smooth muscle cells and by shear stress in endothelial cells (19.Abe J.I. Kushuhara M. Ulevitch R.J.

Interestingly, MEF2 proteins are expressed in these cell types where they have been shown to be involved in vascular development (33.Lin Q. Lu J. Yanagisawa H. Webb R. Lyons G.E. Richardson J.A. Olson E.N. Development. 1998; 125: 4565-4574Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Bi W. Drake C.J. Schwarz J.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, a possible role for BMK1 in endothelial cell organization and smooth muscle cell differentiation warrants investigation. In addition, because these MEF2 proteins are critical in regulating muscle-specific gene expression, it is worthy to determine if BMK1-mediated signaling is involved in the MEF2-dependent differentiation or proliferation of muscle cells during development.The proto-oncogene c-jun is an immediate early gene expressed in quiescent cells in response to mitogens such as growth factors. The induction of c-jun expression, mediated by mitogens or by signals from G protein-coupled receptors, requires ATF1 (AP-1 like) and MEF2 sites in the promoter of this gene (24.Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 35.Coso O.A. Teramoto H. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3963-3966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that a MEF2 promoter element is required for the BMK1-mediated activation of c-jun expression as deletion of this element completely abrogates this effect (Fig. 8 a). The induction of c-jun expression appears to be essential for cell proliferation as microinjection of a deactivating anti-c-jun antibody has been shown to abrogate serum-induced cell cycle progression (36.Kovary K. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4466-4472Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, previous studies in our laboratory have established that BMK1 activity is required for mitogen-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression (20.Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.-D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the requirement for BMK1 in mitogen-induced cell cycle progression may be due to its ability to activate MEF transcription factors and thereby induce c-jun expression. As the ras/rac/MEKK1 signal transduction pathway has also been implicated in EGF-induced c-jun expression (24.Clarke N. Arenzana N. Hai T. Minden A. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to determine if this pathway, along with that provided by BMK1, mediates synergistic effects on c-jun activation.

https://openalex.org/W2996510211,"The glass transition can be viewed simply as the point at which the viscosity of a structurally disordered liquid reaches a universal threshold value. But this is an operational definition that circumvents fundamental issues, such as whether the glass transition is a purely dynamical phenomenon. If so, ergodicity gets broken (the system becomes confined to some part of its phase space), but the thermodynamic properties of the liquid remain unchanged across the transition, provided they are determined as thermodynamic equilibrium averages over the whole phase space. The opposite view claims that an underlying thermodynamic phase transition is responsible for the pronounced slow-down in the dynamics at the liquid-glass boundary. Such a phase transition would trigger the dynamic standstill, and then be masked by it. Here we perform Monte Carlo simulations of a two-dimensional system of polydisperse hard disks far within its glassy phase. The approach allows for non-local moves in a way that preserves micro-reversibility. We find no evidence for a thermodynamic phase transition up to very high densities; the glass is thus indistinguishable from the liquid on purely thermodynamic grounds."

Recent work shows that Hck, a member of the Src tyrosine kinase family with myeloid-restricted expression, associates with and is activated by Bcr-Abl. Here we investigated the mechanism of Hck interaction with Bcr-Abl and the requirement for Hck activation in Bcr-Abl transformation signaling. Binding studies demonstrated that the Hck SH3 and SH2 domains are sufficient for interaction with Bcr-Ablin vitro. Hck binding localizes to the Abl SH2, SH3, and kinase domains as well as the distal portion of the C-terminal tail. To address the requirement for endogenous Src family kinase activation in Bcr-Abl signaling, a kinase-defective mutant of Hck was stably expressed in the cytokine-dependent myeloid leukemia cell line DAGM. Kinase-defective Hck dramatically suppressed Bcr-Abl-induced outgrowth of these cells in the absence of cytokine compared with a control cell line expressing β-galactosidase. In contrast, kinase-defective Hck did not affect cell proliferation in response to interleukin-3, suggesting that the effect is specific for Bcr-Abl.

Bcr-Abl can also activate Ras via Shc, an adaptor protein that couples the receptors for many growth factors and cytokines to the Grb2/Sos complex (14.Goga A. McLaughlin J. Afar D.E.H. Saffran D.C. Witte O.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 981-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Other work has identified Crk-L as a binding partner and substrate for Bcr-Abl (15.Senechal K. Halpern J.

Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Crk-L may couple Bcr-Abl to the guanine-nucleotide exchange factor C3G, providing an additional connection to Ras activation (17.Nosaka Y. Arai A. Miyasaka N. Miura O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30154-30162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to the Ras pathway, Bcr-Abl is coupled to PI-3K signaling and activation of Akt/PKB kinases downstream (18.Skorski T. Bellacosa A. Nieborowska-Skorska M.N. Majewski M. Martinez R. Choi J.K. Trotta R. Wlodarski P. Perrotti D. Chan T.O. Wasik M.A. Tsichlis P.N. Calabretta B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6151-6161Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). This pathway may promote cytokine-independent survival by Bcr-Abl (19.Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C.

Other studies have demonstrated that Bcr-Abl induces activation of Stat transcription factors, which have also been implicated in proliferative and survival signaling in a wide variety of hematopoietic cell types (21.Carlesso N.

Med. 1999; 189: 1229-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). All of these signaling pathways involve components with SH2 and SH3 domains and are dependent upon tyrosine phosphorylation. Although Bcr-Abl possesses a constitutively active tyrosine kinase domain, recent work suggests that it may initiate signaling by activating other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases, including members of the Fps/Fes and Src families (25.Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Warmuth M. Bergmann M. Priess A. Hauslmann K. Emmerich B. Hallek M. J. Biol.

Regarding the Src family, Bcr-Abl has been shown to associate directly with Lyn and Hck in 32Dcl3 cells. This interaction correlates with increased Lyn and Hck tyrosine kinase activity (25.Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Hck has been shown to phosphorylate p210 Bcr-Abl on Tyr 177, the site responsible for direct recruitment of Grb-2/Sos through the Grb-2 SH2 domain (26.Warmuth M. Bergmann M. Priess A. Hauslmann K. Emmerich B. Hallek M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33260-33270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This result suggests that Src family kinases may facilitate the coupling of Bcr-Abl to Ras and other signaling pathways related to transformation. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of Hck interaction with Bcr-Abl. We observed that the Hck SH2 and SH3 domains bind strongly to recombinant Bcr-Ablin vitro. Constitutive binding was observed with the SH3 domain, while SH2-mediated binding was found to require Bcr-Abl autophosphorylation. In reciprocal experiments, we observed that multiple regions of Abl, including the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains as well as the distal portion of the C-terminal region interact directly with Hck. We also found that a kinase-inactive mutant of Hck strongly suppressed Bcr-Abl proliferative signals in cytokine-dependent myeloid leukemia cells, suggesting that activation of Hck or other members of the Src kinase family is required for Bcr-Abl transformation signaling. Activation of Src family kinases by Bcr-Abl may contribute to the diversity of signaling pathways activated by this transforming tyrosine kinase. Construction of pGEX-2T vectors and expression of the noncatalytic regions of Hck as GST fusion proteins is described elsewhere (29.Briggs S.D. Bryant S.S. Jove R. Sanderson S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14718-14724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly,Escherichia coli DH5α were transformed with pGEX-Hck constructs, and GST fusion protein expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Following induction, recombinant fusion proteins were isolated from clarified cell extracts with glutathione-agarose beads. The concentration of each protein was determined on Coomassie-stained gels by two-dimensional laser densitometry using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For the binding reactions, wild-type and kinase-defective forms of Bcr-Abl were expressed in Sf-9 insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses as described elsewhere (28.Lionberger J.M. Smithgall T.E. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1097-1103PubMed Google Scholar). Immobilized GST fusion proteins (20 μg) or GST alone as a negative control were added to 1 ml aliquots of clarified Sf-9 cell lysates and rotated at 4 °C for 2 h. Fusion proteins were pelleted by centrifugation and washed once with 1.0 ml Hck lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100) followed by three washes with RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS). Precipitated proteins were solubilized in SDS-PAGE sample buffer and associated Bcr-Abl was detected by immunoblotting. The coding sequences for the human Abl SH3 and SH2 domains (Gly57–Thr224) and kinase domain (Tyr215–Ile489) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL-GST (30.Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of Abl was similarly amplified as a series of four sequences encoding residues Pro480–Gly638 (CT1), Arg639–Leu813 (CT2), Ile801–Ala993 (CT3), and Gly994–Arg1130 (CT4), which were subcloned into the same vector. The resulting pVL-GST constructs were used to create recombinant baculoviruses for the expression of these Abl regions as GST fusion proteins. Sf-9 cells (2.5 × 106) were co-infected with each of the GST-Abl baculoviruses (or a GST baculovirus as a negative control) and an Hck baculovirus. Forty-eight h postinfection, the cells were lysed in 1.0 ml of Hck lysis buffer, and GST fusion proteins were precipitated with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma; 20 μl of a 50% w/v suspension). The precipitates were washed three times with 1.0 ml of RIPA buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by heating in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were resolved on duplicate SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Associated Hck was visualized by immunoblotting with Hck polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz). The amount of precipitated GST-Abl fusion protein present in each reaction was determined by immunoblotting with anti-GST antibodies (Santa Cruz). Equivalent expression of Hck in each culture was verified by immunoblot analysis of the clarified cell lysates. The relative amount of bound Hck and GST-Abl fusion protein present in each lane was determined by densitometry (Bio-Rad GS-710 Imaging Densitometer), and the amount of Hck bound was corrected to the amount of GST-Abl fusion protein present in each sample. Subcloning of the Hck wild-type and kinase-inactive (Hck-KE) cDNAs into the retroviral expression vector pSRαMSVtkneo (31.Muller A.J. Young J.C. Pendergast A.M. Pondel M. Landau R.N. Littman D.R.

The coding sequence for bacterial β-galactosidase was subcloned from the expression vector pCMVSport (Life Technologies, Inc.) into pSRαMSVtkneo. Similar pSRαMSVtkneo constructs containing the coding sequences for the p210 and p185 forms of Bcr-Abl were obtained from Dr. Owen Witte, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, UCLA. To make retroviral stocks, subconfluent 100-mm dishes of 293T cells were transfected with 30 μg of each retroviral construct and an ecotropic packaging vector using the calcium phosphate method described elsewhere (32.Briggs S.D.

Viral supernatants were collected 48, 72, and 96 h posttransfection, pooled, filtered with 0.45-μm filters, and stored at −80 °C. DAGM myeloid leukemia cells (14.Goga A. McLaughlin J. Afar D.E.H. Saffran D.C. Witte O.N.

Cells were infected with β-gal or Hck retroviruses and selected with G-418 at 800 μg/ml. Expression of Hck proteins in the drug-resistant cell populations was verified by immunoblotting. Hck and β-gal control cells were then superinfected with Bcr-Abl or β-gal control retroviruses as follows: 106 cells were resuspended in 5 ml of viral supernatant in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene. To enhance retroviral gene transfer, culture plates were centrifuged at 2,400 rpm for 4 h at 20 °C (35.Bahnson A.B. Dunigan J.T. Baysal B.E. Mohney T. Atchison R.W. Nimgaonkar M.T. Ball E.D. Barranger J.A. J. Virol. Methods. 1995; 54: 131-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The virus was replaced with fresh medium containing G-418 and IL-3 and the cultures incubated for 72 h. For analysis of IL-3-independent outgrowth, cells were washed free of cytokine and 4 × 104 cells were plated in 100 μl of complete medium in each well of a 96-well plate. To quantitate cell outgrowth, cells in each well were combined with 25 μl of MTT reagent (5 mg/ml in H2O) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 100 μl of MTT lysis buffer (50%N,N-dimethylformamide in H2O containing 20% SDS, 2.5% glacial acetic acid, and 2.5% 1n HCl, pH 4.7). Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the absorbance of each well was read at 570 nm. Positive controls were analyzed in a similar manner in the presence of IL-3. For all plates, a well containing only culture medium and no cells served as a background control for the absorbance readings. Previous studies have shown that Bcr-Abl forms a complex with endogenous Hck and Lyn in 32Dcl3 myeloid leukemia cells and that interaction correlates with activation of these Src family kinases (25.Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the molecular basis for this interaction, we expressed a family of GST fusion proteins containing each of the noncatalytic domains of Hck (N-terminal, SH3, and SH2 either alone or in various combinations) in E. coli and immobilized them on glutathione-agarose beads. Equal amounts of each fusion protein were incubated with lysates from Sf-9 cells expressing the p210 form of Bcr-Abl, a kinase-defective form of p210 (p210-KR) or the p185 form of Bcr-Abl. Protein complexes were collected by centrifugation, washed, and associated Bcr-Abl was visualized by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1, fusion proteins containing the Hck SH2 or SH3 domains readily precipitated both p210 and p185 Bcr-Abl. In contrast, no binding was detected with a GST fusion protein of the unique N-terminal region of Hck, GST alone, or the glutathione-agarose resin. To test for the dependence of these interactions on Bcr-Abl tyrosine phosphorylation, a similar experiment was conducted with extracts from Sf-9 cells expressing the kinase-defective form of p210 Bcr-Abl. As shown in Fig. 1, this mutant was unable to bind to the isolated Hck SH2 domain, strongly suggesting that autophosphorylation of Bcr-Abl creates a specific binding site for the SH2 domain of Hck. In contrast, the kinase-defective mutant bound to the fusion proteins containing the SH3 domain to the same extent as kinase-active Bcr-Abl, as expected for an SH3-mediated interaction. These results indicate that multiple docking sites for Src family kinases exist within Bcr-Abl. Recent studies have shown that SH3 and SH2 engagement is sufficient to activate Src kinases in a variety of cellular contexts. The SH2/SH3-mediated interaction of Hck with Bcr-Abl may provide a mechanistic basis for previous reports of Hck activation by Bcr-Abl in vivo (see “Discussion”). To identify the regions of Bcr-Abl that interact with Hck, a series of GST-Abl fusion proteins was co-expressed with wild-type Hck in Sf-9 cells. The primary structures of these GST-Abl fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 2 and include the SH3/SH2 region, the kinase domain, and the long C-terminal tail as a series of four fusion proteins. The GST-Abl proteins were precipitated from infected cell lysates with glutathione-agarose beads, and associated Hck was visualized by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.3, several regions of Abl bound independently to Hck, including the SH3/SH2 region, the kinase domain, and the distal portion of the C-terminal tail. Hck did not bind to the Abl C-terminal fusion proteins containing proline-rich sequences involved in SH3 binding to the Crk-L adaptor protein (16.Heaney C. Kolibaba K. Bhat A. Oda T. Ohno S. Fanning S. Druker B.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 297-306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that Hck interacts with the Abl portion of Bcr-Abl through multiple sites that may include a novel interaction with the C-terminal actin-binding domain (see “Discussion”).Figure 3Hck interacts with multiple regions of Abl. Recombinant GST-Abl fusion proteins shown in Fig. 2 (or GST alone as negative control) were co-expressed with Hck in Sf-9 insect cells. The fusion proteins were precipitated from clarified cell lysates with glutathione-agarose beads, washed with RIPA buffer, and associated Hck was visualized by immunoblotting (Bound). Recovery of each GST fusion protein was determined by immunoblotting an aliquot of the precipitate with anti-GST antibodies (GST). The asterisks indicate the positions of the full-length fusion proteins. To verify equivalent expression of Hck in each sample, an aliquot of the lysate was also blotted with anti-Hck antibodies (Lysate). The levels of bound Hck and GST-Abl fusion proteins were determined by densitometry, and the relative ratios of Hck bound to GST-Abl present are presented at the top. This experiment was repeated three times with comparable results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have demonstrated a direct interaction of Bcr-Abl with Hck and Lyn in myeloid leukemia cells, suggesting that activation of Src kinases may contribute to Bcr-Abl signaling (25.Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether interaction with endogenous Src kinases is required for Bcr-Abl signal transduction, we tested the effect of kinase-inactive Hck on Bcr-Abl-induced transformation of the IL-3-dependent myeloid leukemia cell line, DAGM. Introduction of Bcr-Abl into these cells with a recombinant retrovirus has been shown to result in cytokine-independent proliferation (14.Goga A. McLaughlin J. Afar D.E.H. Saffran D.C. Witte O.N. Cell. 1995; 82: 981-988Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). DAGM cells were infected with recombinant retroviruses carrying either the kinase-defective form of Hck (Hck-KE) or β-galactosidase (β-gal) as a negative control. Cells were selected in the presence of G-418 and cytokine, and expression of Hck-KE was verified by immunoblotting (data not shown). The DAGM cell populations stably expressing Hck-KE or β-gal were then re-infected with retroviruses carrying p210 Bcr-Abl, p185 Bcr-Abl, or the β-gal control. Cytokine-independent proliferation was monitored using an MTT reduction assay, and the results are presented in Fig.4. As expected, both p185 and p210 Bcr-Abl induced rapid cellular outgrowth in the β-gal control cell populations, consistent with previous results. However, the presence of kinase-defective Hck dramatically suppressed DAGM cell outgrowth by both forms of Bcr-Abl relative to the β-gal control cells. No outgrowth was observed with any of the cell populations following superinfection with the β-gal control virus, indicating that transformation to cytokine independence is dependent upon Bcr-Abl. These data provide the first evidence that Src kinases play an essential role in transformation signaling downstream of Bcr/Abl. To determine whether expression of kinase-defective Hck produced a general suppression of proliferative capacity, the populations of DAGM cells expressing Hck-KE as well as the β-gal control cells were treated with IL-3 and outgrowth was measured using the MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the cells grew rapidly in the presence of IL-3, suggesting that the actions of Hck-KE are specific for Bcr-Abl and are not the result of a general suppressive effect on cell proliferation or survival. In a final control experiment, we examined whether overexpression of wild-type Hck affected p210 Bcr-Abl-induced conversion of DAGM cells to cytokine independence. Cell populations were produced which stably expressed β-gal, wild-type Hck, or kinase-defective Hck as described in the preceding section. These cell populations were then re-infected with retroviruses carrying p210 Bcr-Abl or the β-gal control, and cytokine-independent proliferation was monitored using the MTT reduction assay. As shown in Fig. 6, wild-type Hck partially suppressed Bcr-Abl-induced conversion of DAGM cells to cytokine independence relative to the β-gal control. In contrast, kinase-defective Hck produced a complete block in outgrowth, consistent with the data shown in Fig. 4. All three of these cell lines showed identical proliferative responses in the presence of IL-3 (data not shown). The partial suppressive action of wild-type Hck overexpression suggests that activation of multiple Src family members may contribute to survival and proliferative signaling by Bcr-Abl (see “Discussion”). Data presented in this paper provide new mechanistic insight regarding the association of Src family kinases with Bcr-Abl and show for the first time that these interactions may be required for Bcr-Abl transformation signaling. Regarding the mechanism of interaction, binding assays demonstrate that the SH2 and SH3 domains of Hck are sufficient to bind Bcr-Abl in vitro (Fig. 1). SH2-dependent binding occurs through a phosphotyrosine-dependent mechanism, as a kinase-defective mutant of Bcr-Abl was unable to bind to the Hck SH2 domain. These data suggest a mechanism to explain previous observations that interaction with Bcr-Abl activates Hck and Lyn (25.Danhauser-Riedl S. Warmuth M. Druker B.J. Emmerich B. Hallek M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3589-3596PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of Src family kinases to other proteins through their SH2 and/or SH3 domains is often sufficient for activation. For example, the SH3-dependent interaction of Hck with the Nef protein of HIV-1 leads to Hck activation and transformation of Rat-2 fibroblasts (32.Briggs S.D. Sharkey M. Stevenson M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17899-17902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 36.Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26579-26583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This effect is due to the ability of Nef to displace the SH3 domain of Hck from an intramolecular interaction with the linker connecting the SH2 and kinase domains (37.Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Together with intramolecular binding of the tyrosine-phosphorylated tail region to the SH2 domain, SH3-linker interaction is a key part of negative regulation of Src family kinases (38.Sicheri F. Kuriyan J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1997; 7: 777-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Binding of Hck or other Src kinases to Bcr-Abl through their SH3 and SH2 domains may result in kinase activation though a similar mechanism involving disruption of intramolecular regulatory interactions. Three regions within the Abl portion of Bcr-Abl demonstrated strong interactions with Hck, including the SH3/SH2 region, the kinase domain, and the distal portion of the C-terminal tail. Binding of the Abl SH3/SH2 region to Hck may occur through sites of Hck tyrosine autophosphorylation and/or the polyproline linker connecting the SH2 and kinase domains. Interaction of the Abl SH3 domain with the Hck linker could contribute to Hck activation by disturbing intramolecular SH3-linker interactions as described above. Interestingly, the SH2/SH3 region of Bcr-Abl has recently been shown to play a role in the activation of Stat5, although direct interaction of Bcr-Abl with Stat5 does not occur to a significant extent (24.Nieborowska-Skorska M. Wasik M.A. Slupianek A. Salomoni P. Kitamura T. Calabretta B. Skorski T. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1229-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Our observation that the SH3/SH2 region of Bcr-Abl is involved in the recruitment of Hck suggests that Src kinases may serve as intermediates linking Bcr-Abl to Stat5 activation and downstream survival signaling. Interaction experiments involving the Abl C-terminal region also produced unexpected results. Fusion proteins encompassing the C-terminal regions of Abl with known SH3-binding sites for other proteins such as Crk-L did not interact strongly with Hck (Figs. 2 and3). On the other hand, the fusion protein containing the C-terminal 137 amino acids of Abl (CT4) associated strongly with Hck, despite the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation or an obvious PxxP motif. This region of Abl encompasses the F-actin binding domain and is required for Bcr-Abl transforming activity (39.McWhirter J.R. Galasso D.L. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7587-7595Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 40.McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1533-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 41.McWhirter J.R. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1553-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether or not this region also contributes to interactions with Src-related kinases in vivowill require further study. In addition to investigating the mechanism of Bcr-Abl interaction with Src kinases, we also present evidence that activation of Hck or other Src family members may be required for transformation signaling by Bcr-Abl in myeloid cells. Co-expression of Bcr-Abl with a kinase-defective mutant of Hck strongly suppressed both p185 and p210 Bcr-Abl signals for cytokine-independent outgrowth of the DAGM myeloid leukemia cell line (Fig. 4). This result is consistent with the binding data shown in Fig. 1, as both forms of Bcr-Abl demonstrated equivalent binding to the SH2 and SH3 domains of Hck. In contrast, kinase-defective Hck had no effect on cytokine-induced cell outgrowth, arguing against a nonspecific effect of Hck on cellular proliferation (Fig. 5). These results suggest that the kinase-defective mutant of Hck interacts directly with Bcr-Abl and competes for association with endogenous Src family kinases, resulting in the observed suppression of DAGM cell proliferation. The partial suppressive effect of wild-type Hck in this system (Fig. 6) suggests that activation of more than one Src kinase family member may contribute to survival and proliferative signaling. Overexpression of wild-type Hck may compete for activation of other Src family members required for a complete biological signal, while maintaining the signal from Hck. Consistent with this idea is the observation that Lyn and Fyn associate with the same regions of Bcr-Abl as Hck in vitro (data not shown). Previous studies have shown that kinase-defective and other Src mutants can interfere with growth factor and cytokine signal transduction and block growth factor induced entry into the cell cycle in some cases (reviewed in Ref. 42.Abram C.L. Courtneidge S.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 254: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Whether or not Src kinases are required to couple Bcr-Abl to proliferative and survival signaling pathways during the development of CML will require further investigation. We thank Dr. Owen Witte, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, UCLA for the Bcr-Abl cDNA clones, retroviral vectors, and the DAGM cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2043683039,"It has been generally accepted that the TATA binding protein (TBP) is a universal mediator of transcription by RNA polymerase I, II, and III. Here we report that the TBP-related factor TRF1 rather than TBP is responsible for RNA polymerase III transcription in Drosophila. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro transcription assays using immunodepleted extracts supplemented with recombinant proteins reveals that a TRF1:BRF complex is required to reconstitute transcription of tRNA, 5S and U6 RNA genes. In vivo, the majority of TRF1 is complexed with BRF and these two proteins colocalize at many polytene chromosome sites containing RNA pol III genes. These data suggest that in Drosophila, TRF1 rather than TBP forms a complex with BRF that plays a major role in RNA pol III transcription."

Vav1 activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases JNK and p38. The Vav1-mediated activation of JNK employed a pathway involving Rac, HPK1, MLK3, and MKK7. The costimulation-induced activation of p38 was inhibited by dominant negative forms of Vav1, Rac, and MKK6. Here we show that Vav1 also induces transcription factors that bind to the CD28RE/AP element contained in the interleukin-2 promoter. A detailed mutational analysis of Vav1 revealed a series of constitutively active and nonfunctional forms of Vav1. Almost all inactive versions were mutated in their Dbl homology domain and behaved as dominant negative mutants that impaired costimulation-induced activation of JNK, p38, and CD28RE/AP-dependent transcription. In contrast to NF-AT-dependent transcription, Vav1-mediated transcriptional induction of the CD28RE/AP element in the interleukin-2 promoter could only partially be inhibited by cyclosporin A, suggesting a dual role of Vav1 for controlling Ca2+-dependent and -independent events. In this study we identified tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav1 as an early point of integration between the signaling routes triggered by the T-cell receptor and CD28 in human T-cell leukemia cells. Costimulation resulted in a prolonged and sustained phosphorylation and membrane localization of Vav1 in comparison to T-cell receptor activation alone.

Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Full activation of T-lymphocytes necessarily requires two signals (2.Bretscher P. Cohn M. Science. 1970; 169: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The first signal is provided by the interaction of major histocompatibility complex molecules loaded with processed foreign antigens on antigen-presenting cells with the specific TCR·CD3·CD4 complex. The second signal is mediated by the occupancy of auxiliary receptors such as CD28. The two signaling pathways derived either from TCR or CD28 merge and synergistically stimulate the activity of JNK, NF-κB, and the expression of various target genes including IL-2, which promotes the proliferation and differentiation of T-cells and is therefore required for the full immune response (3.Gomez J. Gonzalez A. Martinez A.-C. Rebollo A. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 185-220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Costimulation also induces an actin/myosin-dependent, directional transport of proteins including the TCR and lipid domains to a cap structure, termed the immunological synapse (4.Grakoui A. Bromley S.K. Sumen C. Davis M.M. Shaw A.S. Allen P.M. Dustin M.L. Science. 1999; 285: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). One of the earliest events in TCR signaling is the activation of cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, including members of the Src (Lck and Fyn) and Syk (ZAP70 and Syk) families (5.Wange R.L. Samelson L.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 197-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Induced tyrosine phosphorylation of target proteins allows the formation of multiprotein complexes at the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. Membrane anchorage is mediated by transmembrane adaptor proteins including linker for activation of T-cells (LAT) (6.Zhang W. Sloan Lancaster J. Kitchen J. Trible R.P. Samelson L.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 83-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar), which serve as docking ports for the formation of multiprotein complexes. This complex, which we refer to as T-cell activation signaling complex (TASC), contains other crucial signaling molecules such as PLCγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the adaptor protein SLP76 (7.Schraven B. Marie-Cardine A. Hübener C. Bruyns E. Ding I. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The TASC propagates the signals and links them to multiple downstream signaling pathways. Tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT binds to PLCγ which then cleaves phosphatidylinositol diphosphate thus generating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol. Whereas diacylglycerol mediates activation of protein kinase C family members (8.Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6174) Google Scholar), inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate mobilizes Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The Ca2+-mediated activation of the serine phosphatase calcineurin stimulates the nuclear entry of transcription factor NF-ATc (9.Jain J. McCaffrey P.G. Miner Z. Kerppola T.K. Lambert J.N. Verdine G.L. Curran T. Rao A. Nature. 1993; 365: 352-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Among the substrates for protein tyrosine kinases is also the Vav1 protein, which is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells. The 95-kDa product of the Vav1 proto-oncogene displays a unique arrangement of signaling motifs including a calponin homology domain, an acidic domain, a DBL homology (DH) domain, a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, a cysteine-rich domain (CR), a SH2 domain flanked by two proline-binding SH3 domains, and a bipartite putative nuclear localization signal (10.Romero F. Fischer S. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments show that Vav1, once activated by phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate binding and Lck phosphorylation, stimulates the GDP/GTP exchange activity of Rac (11.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 12.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Therefore, Vav1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) with selectivity for the Rho family of GTPases such as Rac. Gene disruption experiments reveal the importance of Vav1 for receptor-mediated proliferation, cytoskeletal reorganization, and thymic selection (13.Fischer K.D. Zmuldzinas A. Gardner S. Barbacid M.

Biol. 1995; 15: 4337-4346Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) can be further augmented by overexpression of Vav1 together with SLP76 (20.Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). However, the underlying biochemical mechanisms for these functions and the signaling routes employed by Vav1 are not fully understood (10.Romero F. Fischer S. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The molecular events mediating the cooperation between TCR- and CD28-induced signaling are incompletely known. The synergistic activation appears to be unique for JNK and NF-κB (21.Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25185-25190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), since neither ERK nor NF-AT requires coreceptor-derived signals. The signals generated at the cell surface are then transmitted downstream to the cell nucleus on different routes. Small GTP-binding proteins employ the widely used mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways that lead to the activation of p38 and JNK. The different cytoplasmic signals are finally integrated by multiple recognition motifs contained within the promoter of the IL-2 gene (22.Jain J. Loh C. Rao A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1995; 7: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). This promoter harbors binding sites for numerous transcription factors including NF-AT, NF-κB, AP-1, and the CD28RE/AP composite element. The latter is contacted by various proteins including members of the NF-κB/Rel and AP-1 families of transcription factors and so far only partially characterized proteins comprised in the so-called CD28 response complex (23.McGuire K.L. Iacobelli M. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 1319-1327PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to study and characterize the early molecular mechanisms underlying the synergism between TCR- and CD28-mediated signaling. We identify tyrosine-phosphorylated Vav1 as an early point of signal integration upstream from Rac. Vav1 shows synergistic and sustained phosphorylation, membrane localization, and assembly into a multiprotein TASC in response to CD28 costimulation. Vav1 synergizes with TCR/CD28- and also CD28-derived signals to activate the MAPK family members JNK and p38. Vav1 strongly activates transcription from the CD28RE/AP element contained within the IL-2 promoter. The effects of various inactive and constitutively active Vav1 mutants reveal Vav1 as an important integrator for signals provided by the TCR and CD28. Jurkat T-leukemia cells expressing the large T antigen were grown at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 10 mm Hepes, 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mm glutamine, and 2 mg/ml G418. Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) at 250 V/950 microfarads. Stimulation of Jurkat cells was performed in a final volume of 500 μl by adding αCD3 (final concentration 10 μg/ml, clone OKT3) and/or αCD28 (final concentration 10 μg/ml, clone 9.3). Cell lysates were prepared and cleared from the stimulating antibodies with protein A/G-Sepharose prior to further analysis. αFLAG-M2 antibody was purchased from Sigma, and αHA antibody (12CA5) was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals; α-phosphotyrosine (4G10), αMyc (9E10), and αVav1 monoclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.; α-phospho-p38 was from New England Biolabs. αTCR(CD3) (OKT3), αCD28, and isotype-matched control antibodies (IgG2) were kindly provided by Dr. R. Breitkreuz. Antibodies against LAT, SLP76, Lck, PLCγ, p85, and Lck were purchased by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All other reagents were from Sigma or Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed essentially as described by preparing nuclear extracts (24.Shapiro V.S. Truitt K.E. Imboden J.B. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4051-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of nuclear protein were tested for DNA binding to the following CD28RE/AP oligonucleotide: 5′-TCTGGTTTAAAGAAATTCCAAAGAGTCATCAG-3′ and 3′-CAAATTTCTTTAAGGTTTCTCAGTAGTCAGCT-5′. The supershift experiments were performed by preincubating the extracts with 2 μg of the respective antibodies (αc-Rel, gift from Dr. N. Rice; αp65 and αp50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the pellets were resuspended on ice for 30 min in 250 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm NaF, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, leupeptin (10 μg/ml), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). The cell debris was pelleted upon centrifugation with 14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. Extracts from antibody-stimulated cells were precleared with protein A/G-Sepharose. Equal amounts of protein contained in the supernatants were mixed with 1–2 μg of antibody and 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose. After rotation for 4 h on a spinning wheel at 4 °C, the immunoprecipitates were washed 5× in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were boiled in 1× SDS sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE prior to immunoblotting. The proteins were detected after extensive washing with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Western blots were quantitated using the Lumi-ImagerTM from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. 3 × 107 Jurkat cells were stimulated with αTCR(CD3)/αCD28 antibodies as specified in the figure legends. Cells were collected by centrifugation and washed in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 250 μl of Buffer S1 (10 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 38 mm NaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 25 mmNaF, 1 mm vanadate) and subjected to four freeze-thaw cycles. Subsequently nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation. Membrane fractions were obtained after a 100,000 × gcentrifugation step of cytosolic extracts. The supernatant of this step represents the S100 fraction. The membrane pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 6 m urea prior to the addition of SDS sample buffer (fraction “membrane”). Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer 1 day after transfection. The JNK protein contained in the cell lysate was precipitated by the addition of 1 μg of αHA antibody (12CA5) and 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose. The precipitate was washed three times in lysis buffer and two times in kinase buffer (20 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.4, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20 mm MgCl2). The kinase assay was performed in a final volume of 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of GST-c-Jun, 20 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation for 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5× SDS loading buffer. After separation by SDS-PAGE the gel was fixed, dried, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Vav1 deletion mutants were constructed by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pEF-BOS-derived vectors containing either a FLAG or Myc epitope tag. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the Quickchange Kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All point mutants were sequenced, and Vav1 inserts were subcloned into the original vectors to avoid point mutations in the vector backbone. pRK5-Vav1 was provided by Dr. A. Ullrich (25.Hobert O. Schilling J.W. Beckerle M.C. Ullrich A. Jallal B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1577-1581PubMed Google Scholar), and SLP76 expression vectors were provided by Dr. G. Koretzky (26.Musci M.A. Motto D.G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). MKK7 vectors were a gift from Dr. E. Nishida (31.Moriguchi T. Toyoshima F. Masuyama N. Hanafusa H. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7045-7053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). MKK6, MKK4, and p38 expression constructs were provided by Dr. R. Davis. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer and lysed in reporter lysis buffer (25 mm trisphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm CDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). The luminometer (Duo Lumat LB 9507, Berthold) was programmed to inject 50 μl of assay buffer (40 mm Tricine, 2.14 mm(MgCO3)4Mg(OH)2 × 5 H2O, 5.34 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm EDTA, 66.6 mm dithiothreitol, 540 μm CoA, 940 μm luciferin, 1.06 mm ATP) and to measure light emission for 10 s after injection. The most proximal events in T-cell signaling occur at the plasma membrane. Here, not only the receptors but, in addition, also many consecutive downstream effectors such as Src family kinases or PLCγ are in proximity to the membrane. Therefore, we investigated the subcellular localization of the Vav1 protein in response to T-cell activation. Exposure of human T-cell lymphoma Jurkat cells tested for high level expression of both surface molecules (data not shown) to a combination of soluble agonistic αTCR(CD3) and αCD28 antibodies, followed by subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting, revealed an immediate and nearly complete recruitment of Vav1 to the plasma membrane (Fig.1 A). Relocation to the cytosol was detectable approximately 30 min after stimulation. Subsequently, we compared the membrane localization of Vav1 in response to TCR(CD3)/CD28 costimulation with the stimulation of both receptors alone (Fig.1 B). TCR(CD3)-stimulated T-cells showed a rapid and almost complete membrane recruitment of Vav1, whereas CD28 stimulation failed to induce membrane localization of Vav1. The TCR(CD3)/CD28-costimulated T-cells showed no significant difference in respect to the amount of membrane-recruited Vav1, but the kinetics of Vav1 relocation to the cytoplasm was significantly slower in the costimulated T-cells, when compared with T-cells that received their signals only from the TCR. Previous studies identified Vav1 as one of the earliest targets for protein tyrosine kinases following a wide array of different stimuli (32.Margolis B. Hu P. Katzav S. Li W. Oliver J.M. Ullrich A. Weiss A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 356: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Vav1 is not only phosphorylated upon TCR cross-linking but also in response to solely triggering the CD28 receptor either by its physiologic ligand B7.1 or by agonistic antibodies (33.Nuñes J.A. Collette Y. Truneh A. Olive D. Cantrell D.A. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1067-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Vav1 receives signals from both receptors, we compared the tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 in response to stimulation of TCR(CD3) or CD28 alone versus simultaneous stimulation of both receptors. Human T-cell lymphoma Jurkat cells were treated with αTCR(CD3) and/or αCD28 antibodies as indicated (Fig.1 C). The tyrosine phosphorylation status of the immunoprecipitated Vav1 protein was analyzed by immunoblotting with a monoclonal α-phosphotyrosine antibody. The induced phosphorylation of Vav1 occurred 1 min after stimulation of TCR(CD3) and reached a maximum after 5 min. Albeit less intense, the CD28-triggered Vav1 phosphorylation was significantly more durable and stable in comparison to TCR(CD3) activation. The coligation of both receptors resulted in a stronger and prolonged tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1, showing that the cooperative effects between TCR and CD28 are already manifested on the level of Vav1 tyrosine phosphorylation. Vav1 phosphorylation was accompanied by the increased appearance of two coprecipitating tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, which were identified as SLP76 and the regulatory p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase by immunoblotting (Fig. 1 C). We next asked whether the costimulation-induced increase in the coprecipitating phosphoproteins reflects an increased tyrosine phosphorylation or enhanced protein/protein interactions. Jurkat cells were left untreated or stimulated with various combinations of αTCR(CD3) and αCD28 antibodies. Total cell extracts were prepared, and the endogenous Vav1 protein was isolated by immunoprecipitation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated coprecipitating proteins were detected by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A, upper). These experiments revealed several proteins that were inducibly phosphorylated by costimulation. Western blot experiments revealed the prominent phosphotyrosine protein of 95 kDa as Vav1 (data not shown). Some of the Vav1-associated coprecipitating proteins were identified by Western blotting (Fig. 2 A, lower). TCR(CD3) ligation resulted in the induced association of Vav1 with PLCγ, p85, SLP76, Lck, and LAT. Triggering of the costimulatory CD28 receptor alone induced the association of Vav1 with Lck, SLP76, and p85. Upon ligation of both receptors, a synergistic association was evident for PLCγ, p85, SLP76, and LAT, whereas the association with Lck was only additive (Fig. 2 A, lower). Remarkably, these differences became only evident following a stimulation period of 15 min but were hardly detectable in response to receptor activation for less than 10 min. In summary, these experiments suggest that the signals emanating from both receptors merge at an early stage of signal transduction and affect Vav1 phosphorylation and the inducible TASC formation. The proteins constituting the TASC are not completely identified, and their stoichiometry and sequential order of binding is not fully understood. The coprecipitation between Vav1 and LAT (see Fig.2 A) raises the possibility that the membrane attachment of Vav1 is mediated via LAT. We therefore addressed the question whether Vav1 directly binds to LAT or whether this contact requires intermediate proteins such as SLP76, which is known to bind both proteins (7.Schraven B. Marie-Cardine A. Hübener C. Bruyns E. Ding I. Immunol. Today. 1999; 20: 431-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were left untreated or stimulated with various combinations of αTCR(CD3) and αCD28 antibodies. Cell lysates were prepared and divided into several pools that were immunodepleted with antibodies recognizing either Vav1, SLP76, or LAT (Fig. 2 B). SLP76 and LAT were not detectable in Vav1-depleted extracts that were prepared from TCR(CD3)- or TCR(CD3)/CD28-stimulated cells. In contrast, Vav1-depleted extracts from unstimulated or αCD28-treated cells still contained SLP76 and LAT, indicating that binding of Vav1 with SLP76 and LAT is inducible by TCR(CD3) or TCR(CD3)/CD28 stimulation. In a complementary experimental approach, SLP76-depleted extracts were tested for the occurrence of Vav1 and LAT by immunoblotting. Ligation of TCR(CD3) and costimulation triggered association of both proteins, whereas extracts from untreated and CD28-stimulated cells still contained Vav1 and LAT. LAT-depleted extracts showed TCR(CD3)- and TCR(CD3)/CD28-induced binding to Vav1 and SLP76, revealing that all three proteins are mutually binding in an inducible manner. These results show that the entire pool of Vav can be incorporated into a LAT-containing protein complex, which may mediate the membrane recruitment of Vav1. Activation of JNK necessarily requires at least two different inputs, either from CD3 plus CD28 or each of these stimuli in combination with phorbol esters such as PMA (34.Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). An early signal integrating role of Vav1 raises the possibility that it also controls downstream signaling events such as the activation of JNK. This possibility was tested by transient transfection of Jurkat T-cells with a constant amount of an expression vector encoding HA-tagged JNK together with increasing amounts of Vav1 prior to stimulation with αTCR(CD3)/αCD28 antibodies as indicated. The activity of immunoprecipitated JNK was determined by immune complex kinase assays. Increasing amounts of transfected Vav1 resulted in a strongly enhanced costimulation-induced JNK activity (Fig.3 A and supplemental data on the JBC website). The basal JNK activity was not significantly triggered when Vav1 was expressed for 1 day, but expression for more than 36 h resulted in a strong JNK activation (data not shown). Consistent with the model of CD28 as the major contributor for JNK activation, gradual overexpression of Vav1 significantly increased the JNK activity after combined stimulation with CD28 and PMA (Fig.3 B), whereas no additional effects were detectable upon treatment of cells with various concentrations of PMA alone (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 by Lck is known to induce its GEF activity (11.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the impact of Vav1 phosphorylation on its capacity to activate JNK. Lck is an efficient inducer of Vav1 phosphorylation as seen by in vitro kinase assays with immunoprecipitated Lck using bacterially expressed and purified Vav1 protein as a substrate (data not shown). Beyond their physical association, the functional interaction of Vav1 and Lck was investigated by coexpression of Vav1 with increasing amounts of wild type (WT) Lck. Cells were costimulated with αTCR(CD3)/αCD28 antibodies as indicated, and JNK activity was determined (Fig.3 C). In contrast to wild type Lck alone that was ineffective in JNK activation (data not shown), the coexpression of this kinase together with Vav1 resulted in a strong increase of induced JNK activity. The same set of experiments was performed using a dominant negative (DN) form of Lck, which contains a point mutation in the ATP binding domain (LckR273Y505F). Coexpression of increasing amounts of LckR273Y505F efficiently reduced TCR(CD3)/CD28-induced activation of JNK (Fig. 3 D), supporting the importance of Lck for the activation of Vav1. Jacinto and colleagues (35.Jacinto E. Werlen G. Karin M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) also described the participation of Rac for the synergistic activation of JNK. Therefore, we tested the impact of simultaneous Rac and Vav1 coexpression on the costimulation-induced JNK activity. In the presence of constant amounts of Vav1, the coexpression of increasing amounts of WT Rac strongly stimulated the receptor-initiated JNK activation (Fig. 3 E), whereas basal activities were only moderately changed by the wild type form of Rac (data not shown). Coexpression of a dominant negative form of Rac (Asn-17 Rac) dose-dependently decreased the TCR(CD3)/CD28-induced activation of JNK (Fig. 3 F), showing that Rac is an important member of the JNK activation cascade triggered by Vav1. The understanding of signaling pathways and the identification of kinases participating in JNK activation is constantly prog"
https://openalex.org/W2056321966,"The binding of erythropoietin (Epo) to its receptor leads to the transient phosphorylation of the Epo receptor (EpoR) and the activation of intracellular signaling pathways. Inactivation mechanisms are simultaneously turned on, and Epo-induced signaling pathways return to nearly basal levels after 30–60 min of stimulation. We show that proteasomes control these inactivation mechanisms. In cells treated with the proteasome inhibitorsN-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (LLnL) or lactacystin, EpoR tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of intracellular signaling pathways (Jak2, STAT5, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) were sustained for at least 2 h. We show that this effect was due to the continuous replenishment of the cell surface pool of EpoRs in cells treated with proteasome inhibitors. Proteasome inhibitors did not modify the internalization and degradation of Epo·EpoR complexes, but they allowed the continuous replacement of the internalized receptors by newly synthesized receptors. Proteasome inhibitors did not modify the synthesis of EpoRs, but they allowed their transport to the cell surface. N-Ac-Leu-Leu-norleucinal, but not lactacystin, also inhibited the degradation of internalized Epo·EpoR complexes, most probably through cathepsin inhibition. The internalized EpoRs were not tyrosine-phosphorylated, and they did not activate intracellular signaling pathways. Our results show that the proteasome controls the down-regulation of EpoRs in Epo-stimulated cells by inhibiting the cell surface replacement of internalized EpoRs."
https://openalex.org/W1987125440,"Repetitions of CAG or CTG triplets in DNA can form intrastrand hairpin loops with combinations of normal and mismatched base pairs that easily rearrange. Such loops may promote primer-template slippage in DNA replication or repair to give triplet-repeat expansions like those associated with neurodegenerative diseases. Using self-priming sequences (e.g.(CAG)16(CTG)4), we resolve all hairpin loops formed and measure their slippage and expansion rates with DNA polymerase at 37 °C. Comparing CAG/CTG loop structures with GAC/GTC structures, having similar hydrogen bonding but different base stacking, we find that CAG, CTG, and GTC triplets predominantly form even-membered loops that slip in steps of two triplets, whereas GAC triplets favor odd-numbered loops. Slippage rates decline as hairpin stability increases, supporting the idea that slippage initiates more easily in less stable regions. Loop stabilities (in low salt) increase in the order GTC < CAG < GAC < CTG, while slippage rates decrease in the order GTC > CAG ≈ GAC > CTG. Loops of GTC compared with CTG melt 9 °C lower and slip 6-fold faster. We interpret results in terms of base stacking, by relating melting temperature to standard enthalpy changes for doublets of base pairs and mispairs, considering enthalpy-entropy compensation.

Occasionally, a repetitive region within a human gene expands sufficiently to cause inherited human disease (7.Sutherland G.R. Richards R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

At least 12 neurological disorders are associated with triplet repeat expansions within human genes (5.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Eight such disorders arise by the expansion of CAG repetitions in gene regions encoding glutamine repeats in protein. In each case, involving a different gene (Huntingon's disease, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, and spinocerebellar ataxias 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7), the number of CAG repeats in tandem is expanded from a normal range of 5–30 to a disease-causing range of 40–100 (5.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). The resultant polyglutamine expansion in protein may cause disease by forming insoluble nuclear protein aggregates (8.Davies S.W. Turmaine M. Cozens B.A. DiFiglia M. Sharp A.H. Ross C.A.

Another four disorders involve other triplet repetitions expanded in noncoding regions of genes. Myotonic dystrophy, for example, is associated with repeating CTG triplets expanded in an untranslated 3′-terminal gene region, from a normal range of 5–40 repeats to a disease-causing range of 50–3000 (5.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Expansions of this magnitude are also observed in CGG repeats and CCG repeats, found in 5′-untranslated regions of genes associated with fragile X syndromes A and E, respectively (5.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). Similarly large increases are observed for GAA repetitions in an intron of a gene associated with Friedreich's ataxia (5.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar). In each case, the noncoding region involved is transcribed into RNA but not translated into protein. The increased number of repetitions in RNA may cause disease by interfering with RNA transcription or processing within cell nuclei (15.Krahe R. Ashizawa T. Abbruzzese C. Roeder E. Carango P.

In DNA undergoing replication or repair, repeating triplets may enable one DNA strand to slip relative to the other so that the number of triplet repeats can be expanded by DNA polymerase (2.Schlotterer C.

Also, because CNG triplets associated with disease can form intrastrand hairpin folds with secondary structure (20.Gacy A.M. Goellner G. Juranic N. Macura S. McMurray C.T. Cell. 1995; 81: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 21.Mitas M., Yu, A. Dill J. Kamp T.J. Chambers E.J. Haworth I.S.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), it is of interest to determine how such folding affects slippage and expansion with polymerase. Recently, we developed a convenient in vitroassay, using self-priming repeat sequences, to measure rates of slippage and expansion in relation to hairpin structure (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In an earlier study of the major (CAG/CTG) class of disease-associated triplets (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we examined DNA polymerase extension products of the self-priming sequence, (CTG)16(CAG)4, which forms a well defined series of hairpin loops. Using high resolution gel electrophoresis to analyze product lengths, we found that the CTG repeats form loops that are predominantly even-membered (i.e. have even rather than odd numbers of bases in the hairpin bend). The products of polymerase extension were observed to slip and expand in steps of two triplets at rates of ∼1 step/min at 37 °C. In the present study, a similar analysis is made for the complementary case, (CAG)16(CTG)4, and “sister” cases obtained by replacing CAG/CTG with GAC/GTC. Since these cases exhibit the same hydrogen bonding with different base stacking, they reveal the influence of base stacking on the even-odd character of hairpin folds and slippage rates leading to repeat expansions with polymerase. Like the self-priming DNA 60-mer, 5′-(CTG)16(CAG)4-3′ previously studied (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), the complement (CAG)16(CTG)4 and sisters, (GTC)16(GAC)4 and (GAC)16(GTC)4, were each synthesized using β-cyanoethyl phosphoramidites in an Applied Biosystems DNA/RNA synthesizer and purified by electrophoresis on denaturing 12% polyacrylamide gel. Each DNA 60-mer extracted from gel was dialyzed extensively against the same 0.02 m Na+phosphate buffer used previously (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) (5 mmNaH2PO4, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mm Na4EDTA, pH 7.0) and stored at −70 °C. The KFexo−polymerase used to achieve rapid primer 3′ extension on template, anEscherichia coli DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment mutant (D355A,E357A) devoid of 3′ → 5′ as well as 5′ → 3′ exonuclease activity, was purified from overproducing strains (23.Derbyshire V. Freemont P.S. Sanderson M.R. Beese L. Friedman J.M. Joyce C.M. Steitz T.A. Science. 1988; 240: 199-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The dNTP substrates used in extension experiments were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, along with ddNTPs employed for sequence analysis of extended products. Thermal denaturation profiles were obtained for each DNA 60-mer at the same strand concentration (2 μm) in 0.02 m Na+ phosphate buffer (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), by measuring UV absorbance (A 260)versus temperature, from 20 to 85 °C at 2 °C/min. For use in extension reactions, DNA 60-mers were 5′-labeled with 32P, using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (U.S. Biochemical Corp./Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH. 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol). As before (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), labeled samples at 100 nm strand concentration were unfolded by heating at 100 °C for 5 min and refolded by slow cooling to room temperature and then stored at 4 °C to avoid intermolecular associations promoted by freezing (22.Petruska J. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled DNA samples at 10 nm strand concentration, in polymerase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2), were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min to allow equilibration. A 120-μl aliquot was then micropipetted into a 0.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tube containing 30 μl of polymerase plus dNTPs in reaction buffer at 37 °C, at which point (within 3 s), running time (t) for reaction was started. The concentrations of DNA polymerase KFexo− and each dNTP in the reaction mixture were 60 and 400 nm, respectively. After short intervals of reaction time (t = 15 s, 30 s, etc.), a 5-μl aliquot of reaction mixture was removed and added (within 2 s) to 10 μl of 20 m formamide solution containing 20 mm EDTA to quench the reaction. Extension products of radiolabeled DNA were separated into bands of increasing chain length by electrophoresis at 2000 V on 12% polyacrylamide slab gel (40 cm × 40 cm × 0.2 mm) containing 16 m formamide as denaturant, in TBE buffer (90 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 2 mm Na2EDTA). Gels were dried on paper and scanned by a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager. FragmeNT Analysis software (Molecular Dynamics) was used to integrate the intensity of each radioactive band in a gel lane, expressed as a percentage of total integrated band intensities in the lane. In each of the four cases studied here, the initial 60-mer sequence (A) forms a series of self-primed hairpin loops, A n (n= 0, 1, 2, etc.), where n is the number of overhanging template triplets at the 5′-end, as illustrated (Fig. 1,a–d), with an asterisk indicating the 5′-end labeled with 32P. The loops are rapidly extended to their corresponding blunt-end products by adding DNA polymerase and sufficient amounts (0.4 μm each) of the three dNTPs needed to reach near maximum velocity of primer extension on template, with minimal background “pause” banding caused by misinsertion or terminal transferase activity (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In 15 s of reaction time (t) with polymerase, the primer 3′-end ofA n is extended by n primer triplets to form the corresponding blunt-end product, A n plusn triplets, measured as a discrete gel band intensity (I n) by denaturing gel electrophoresis and PhosphorImager analysis. Each I n (n= 0, 1, 2, etc.) changes as reaction time t is increased, because each blunt-end product undergoes slippage and further extension with polymerase. By analyzing I n versus t and extrapolating back to t = 0, we evaluate I n0, indicating the approximate amount of loop A n present initially, before polymerase was added.Figure 1Possible hairpin loops formed by self-priming sequences of CAG/CTG and GAC/GTC triplet repeats. A, self-priming DNA sequence having 16 repeats of a template triplet followed by four repeats of complementary primer triplet;A n, hairpin fold of sequence A, havingn overhanging template triplets on which DNA polymerase can rapidly add n complementary primer triplets to the primer 3′-end. a, loops A n (n = 0, 1, 2, etc.) with hydrogen-bonded base pairs for sequence 5′-(CTG)16(CAG)4-3′; b, corresponding loops for “sister” sequence of same base composition, (GTC)16(GAC)4; c and d, corresponding loops for respective “complementary” cases, (CAG)16(CTG)4 and (GAC)16(GTC)4. The hairpin bends in even-numbered loops (n = 0, 2, … 14) are made with an even number of unpaired bases, minimally four as shown; those in odd-numbered loops (n = 1, 3, … 15) are made with an odd number of unpaired bases (at least three). The hydrogen-bonded, Watson-Crick base pairs are indicated bydots in a horizontal series; three dotsbetween triplets in parentheses indicate stably paired primer-template triplets in the p/t duplex domain; two dotsbetween triplets in parentheses indicate less stably paired template triplets in the t/t loop domain. The asterisk indicates the 5′-end of template labeled with 32P. Note that loopsA n have n template triplets available for extending primer 3′-end on template with DNA polymerase (e.g. polymerase KFexo−). In the presence of three dNTPs (n = C, G, and A or T), polymerase KFexo− rapidly extends A n byn primer triplets to form product blunt-end hairpins. The products in each case, A n plus (CAG)n(a), A n plus (GAC)n(b), A n plus (CTG)n(c), or A n plus (GTC)n(d), are observed as a series of band intensitiesI n (n = 0, 1, 2, etc.) by denaturing gel electrophoresis (Figs. 2 b and 3 b). The changes in I n with increasing reaction time are measured to determine rates at which successive blunt-end product hairpins undergo slippage resulting in further polymerase-catalyzed expansion. Extrapolation of I n to zero reaction time yields I n0, the initial amount ofA n formed by each sequence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The loops are classified as even-numbered or odd-numbered, depending on whether an even or odd number of bases is enclosed within the loop. The even-numbered loops (n = 0, 2, … 10) have the same kind of hairpin bend made with an even number of unpaired bases, minimally four as shown (Fig. 1, a–d). The odd-numbered loops (n = 1, 3, … 11) have another kind of bend made with an odd number of unpaired bases (minimally 3). The other loops shown (n = 12–15) have one or more primer triplets in the bend region where there is less opportunity for correct base pairing; these are much less stable loops, indicating how bend regions change as primer triplets enter the bend region in extreme cases of slippage. The initial blunt-ended loop, A 0, which cannot be extended unless slippage occurs, is seen as band intensityI 0 remaining after 15 s of reaction. AsA 0 undergoes slippage to an extendable form (A 1, A 2, etc.),I 0 declines in a simple manner, suggesting a first order differential equation, dI 0/dt = −k 0 I 0, or in terms of measured differences (Δ) as follows, ΔI0/Δt=−k0I0Equation 1 where k 0 is the slippage rate constant and I 0 is the average intensity value measured in a short time interval, Δt, of 15 or 30 s. For Δt between reaction times t x andt y, the intensity change is ΔI 0 =I 0(t y) −I 0(t x), and the correspondingI 0 on the right side of Equation 1 is the average value, I o = 0.5(I 0(t x) +I 0(t y)). In our experiments, I 0 decays to a low residual “background” intensity (I 0b) that remains nearly constant, indicating that a small fraction (<1%) of initial 60-mers are unreactive at the 3′-end. To takeI 0b into account, we modify Equation 1 as follows. ΔI0/Δt=−k0(I0−I0b)Equation 2 The resultant integrated equation is then the following, ln(I0−I0b)=ln(I0o)−k0tEquation 3 where I 00 is the initial intensity corrected for background. To evaluate I 0b and rate constantk 0, we plot ΔI 0/Δt versus I 0 and fit a straight line by least squares, obtaining slope −k 0 and interceptk 0 I 0b according to Equation 2. Then, using Equation 3, we plot ln(I 0 − I 0b)versus t and linearly extrapolate tot = 0 to obtain I 00, indicating the amount of A 0 present initially, as a percentage of total loops A n (n= 0–11). The rate constantk 0 indicates the rate ofA 0 slippage, resulting in extension with DNA polymerase. Two k 0 components are examined,k 01 contributing to band intensityI 1 (by A 0 →A 1 slippage and extension by 1 triplet) andk 02 contributing to I 2(by A 0 → A 2 slippage and extension by 2 triplets). To determine the relative magnitude of these components, we start with the differential equations, dI 1/dt =k 01 I 0 −k 1 I 1 and dI 2/dt =k 02 I 0 +k 12 I 1 −k 2 I 2 and replace differentials by measured differences, as in Equation 1 as follows. ΔI1/(I1Δt)=k01(I0/I1)−k1Equation 4 ΔI2/(I2Δt)=k02(I0/I2)+k12(I1/I2)−k2Equation 5 Equation 4 is used to evaluate k 01 andk 1 by a linear least squares fit to a plot of ΔI 1/(I 1Δt)versus(I 0/I 1). To evaluatek 02 and k 2 in a similar manner, we examine linear versions of Equation 5 obtained for three different approximations: (a) k 02≫ k 12, (b)k 02 ≈ k 12, and (c) k 02 ≪k 12. Experimental plots of ΔI 2/(I 2Δt) against (a) (I 0/I 2), (b) (I 0 +I 1)/I 2, and (c) I 1/I 2 are then compared to determine which plot gives the best linear least squares fit for k 2 evaluation. In all cases where even-numbered loops predominate, approximation a gives the best fit, indicating that extension following slippage is more frequent in steps of two triplets than in steps of one triplet. Only in the case of (GAC)16(GTC)4, where odd-numbered loops are favored over even-numbered, do we find approximationsb or c giving a better fit. Having evaluated k 0, k 1, and k 2 as described above, we use a similar approach to obtain other k n values forn > 2. In each case, starting with the general form of Equation 5, ΔIn/(InΔt)=kn−2,n(In−2/In)+kn−1,n(In−1/In)−knEquation 6 we apply approximations (a)k n− 2,n ≫k n− 1,n, (b)k n− 2,n ≈k n− 1,n, and (c) k n− 2,n≪ k n− 1,n to determine which gives the best k n estimate by linear least squares fit. In all cases where approximation a applies ton = 2 (i.e. k 02 ≫k 12 in Equation 5), we find that the corresponding general approximation (k n− 2,n ≫k n− 1,n) also applies to Equation 6 for evaluating other even-numbered k nvalues (n = 4, 6, etc.). By using thek n values measured with corresponding simplified (linear) versions of Equations 5 and 6, we extrapolateI n back from t = 15 s tot = 0, to estimate I n0, indicating the initial amount of loop A n present before extension with polymerase. Each of the self-priming sequences examined here, like (CTG)16(CAG)4 previously studied (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), forms a series of hairpin loops, A n (n = 0, 1, 2, etc.), with stable p/t1duplex enclosing a less stable t/t loop domain (Fig.1, a–d). The subscriptn in A n indicates that there aren overhanging template triplets on which DNA polymerase can extend the primer 3′-end rapidly (in seconds) to yield blunt-end product (A n + n triplets) proportional to the amount of A n present. With increasing reaction time, each blunt-end product undergoes slippage, allowing more triplets to be added by DNA polymerase, as shown in Figs.2 and3.Figure 3Comparison of (GAC)16(GTC)4 and (GTC)16(GAC)4 melting transitions and corresponding band patterns showing triplets added with increasing time of DNA polymerase reaction. a, melting curves obtained by plotting UV absorbance A 260 versustemperature at the same (2 μm) strand concentration in low salt buffer, showing that (GAC)16(GTC)4 has higher first T m than (GTC)16(GAC)4 (54 versus 47 °C) but the same second T m (78 °C). b, patterns of bands on denaturing gel, obtained by reaction with DNA polymerase KFexo− at 37 °C, using 0.4 μm each of three dNTPs (N = C, G, and T or A) required for correct extension of primer triplets on template triplets.

The p/t duplex in A n (n = 0, 1, … 11) encloses a t/t loop domain containing 12 − ntemplate triplets. The t/t domain has the hairpin bend made with an even or odd number of unpaired bases and also has mispaired bases held between correct bp formed between opposing (antiparallel) template triplets. Opposing triplets of type CTG or GTC form mispairs of type T opposite T (T/T) held between correct G/C and C/G bp (dots), as shown (Fig. 1, a andb) for sequences (CTG)16(CAG)4 and (GTC)16(GAC)4, respectively. On the other hand, opposing triplets of type CAG or GAC form mispairs of A opposite A (A/A), as shown (Fig. 1, c andd) for (CAG)16(CTG)4 and (GAC)16(GTC)4, respectively. Loops A 12 to A 15(Fig. 1, a–d), having fewer than four of the primer triplets correctly bound to template triplets, are much less stable and are hardly apparent initially. These loops are included to show how bends change in extreme cases of slippage after more then 11 triplets are added by DNA polymerase in longer reaction times (Figs.2 b and 3 b). To measure the relative stability of loop structures formed in absence of polymerase, thermal denaturation curves were obtained for each 60-mer sequence in low salt buffer (0.02m Na+), by plotting UV absorbance (A 260) versus temperature (Figs.2 a and 3 a). In each case, as found previously for (CTG)16(CAG)4 (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), two sigmoidal transitions are evident, the first with melting temperature (T m) below 60 °C and the second with T m near 80 °C. The first transition indicates the melting of the t/t loop domain containing the base pairs and mispairs of template triplet interactions. As anticipated from previous work (22.Petruska J. Arnheim N. Goodman M.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1992-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and seen by comparing Figs. 2 a and 3 a, this domain is most stable for CTG triplets (T m = 56 °C) followed by GAC (54 °C), CAG (52 °C), and last GTC (47 °C). The second transition indicates the dissociation of stable p/t duplex, which melts at nearly the same temperature (T m ≈ 79 °C) in all four cases. If slippage in the stable p/t duplex is promoted by slippage in the less stable t/t domain, as we suggested previously (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), then (GTC)16(GAC)4, having the lowestT m for the first transition (47 °C, Fig.3 a), should also have the highest rate of slippage and expansion with polymerase. This is evidently the case, as seen by comparing gel band patterns (Figs. 2 b and 3 b) obtained by primer extension with DNA polymerase KFexo− at 37 °C, for reaction times ranging from 0.5 to 16 min. The addition of DNA polymerase KFexo− and appropriate (0.4 μm) dNTP substrates results in rapid extension of loops A n to their blunt-end products, A n + ntriplets, resolved as band intensities I n by electrophoresis and 32P PhosphorImager analysis (Figs.2 b and 3 b). After stopping the reaction at various times and resolving product bands in gel lanes, we evaluate band intensities I 0, I 1,I 2, etc. by integration in each lane, to measure the relative amounts of products A 0,A 1 + 1 triplet, A 2 + 2 triplets, etc. as a function of time. The I n values obtained at times of 0.25 and 0.5 min, before products rearrange significantly by slippage, are used for extrapolation back to 0 time, to obtain I n0, indicating the initial amounts of A n present when polymerase was added. In the case of (CTG)16(CAG)4, whose band patterns are shown in Fig. 2 b (left), we see that the loops are predominantly of the even-numbered type, as previously reported (4.Petruska J. Hartenstine M.J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5204-5210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The complementary case, (CAG)16(CTG)4, shown in Fig. 2 b(right), also forms mainly even-numbered loops, as does (GTC)16(GAC)4, shown in Fig. 3 b(left) After 0.5 min of reaction time, the most intense bands correspond to even numbers of triplets added (0, 2, … 10). As reaction time is increased, the band intensities gradually change as blunt-end products rearrange by slippage and are expanded further, mainly in steps of two triplets. By examining band intensity changes with reaction time (Fig.2 b), we see that expansion by slippage is several times faster for (CAG)16(CTG)4 than for (CTG)16(CAG)4. A faster slippage rate is in keeping with the observation (Fig. 2 a) that the first transition has a 4 °C lower T m value, 52 °C, compared with 56 °C for (CTG)16(CAG)4, The second transition in both cases is the same (T m = 79 °C). The “sister” sequence (GTC)16(GAC)4, which has the same base composition as (CTG)16(CAG)4, has a much lower first transition (T m = 47 °C), with no significant change in the second transition (T m = 78 °C), as seen in Fig. 3 a. The first T m is 9 °C below that for (CTG)16(CAG)4, and the rate of expansion by slippage is also much faster as found by comparing the gel band patterns in Figs. 3 b (left) and 2b(left) Nevertheless, (GTC)16(CAG)4still forms even-numbered loops preferentially and slips in steps of two triplets, as do (CTG)16(CAG)4 and (CAG)16(CTG)4. In contrast, (GAC)16(GTC)4, which has the same base composition as (CAG)16(CTG)4, tends to form odd-numbered loops. Unlike the other three cases, the most intense bands in this case (Fig. 3 b, right) correspond to odd numbers of triplets added (1, 3, 5, etc.). The changes in band intensity with time indicate that expansion by slippage is much slower than observed for (GTC)16"

Because inflammatory processes are often accompanied by hsp expression and because stress and cytokines share several signaling pathways, we investigated the possibility that hsp70 might modulate the cellular response to cytokines. We found that stable cell clones overexpressing hsp70, or cells shortly after transfection with hsp70, produced 2 times more nitric oxide and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) protein and mRNA in response to cytokines than control cells expressing undetectable amounts of hsp70. Since mitogen-activated protein kinases participate in the activation of iNOS by cytokines, we investigated whether hsp70 affected the activation of these signaling pathways. hsp70 overexpression led to a specific enhancement of the activation of the p38 pathway by cytokines, producing little or no effect on the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase or Jun N-terminal kinase. Blocking p38 activity with SB203580 totally abolished the enhancing effect of hsp70 on cytokine-induced endogenous iNOS mRNA accumulation or transcription of an iNOS promoter-driven luciferase gene, while having little effect on the cytokine response observed in control cells.

During protein damaging treatments such as heat shock, the capacity of hsp70 to bind denatured proteins provides protection by preventing protein aggregation, accelerating refolding, and mediating degradation of damaged proteins (5.Bukau B.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6124-6134Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). One proposed mechanism involves the inhibition of the activation of the MAP kinases JNK and p38, two stress-activated protein kinases which contribute in some conditions to induction of apoptosis (10.Gabai V.L.

Whereas ERK is preferentially activated by growth factors, JNK and p38 are most strongly activated by chemical and physical stresses and by inflammatory cytokines (12.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2242) Google Scholar). The role of p38 in the cellular response to cytokines is particularly well documented. p38 was discovered as a major LPS-activated protein kinase in macrophages and as the target for a group of anti-inflammatory drugs which inhibit IL-1β and TNFα biosynthesis in monocytes (13.Lee J.C. Laydon J.T. McDonnell P.C. Gallagher T.F. Kumar S. Green D. McNulty D. Blumenthal M.J. Heys J.R. Landvatter S.W. Stricker J.E. McLaughlin M.M. Siemens I.R. Fisher S.M. Livi G.P. White J.R. Adams J.L.

Pharmacological or molecular inhibition of p38 results in reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines by fibroblasts and macrophages and impairs IFN-γ production in T helper 1 cells (13.Lee J.C.

One key element of the action of p38 is its downstream target MAPKAP kinase-2, which regulates both the stability and the translation of cytokine mRNAs containing AU-rich sequences in their 3′-untranslated region (19.Winzen R.

A number of circumstantial evidence suggests a role of hsp in cytokine signal transduction and in the control of cytokine expression. Heat shock treatments sufficient to induce hsp accumulation reduced TNFα and IL-1β induction in monocytes after stimulation with LPS (26.Ensor J.E. Wiener S.M. McCrea K.A. Viscardi R.M. Crawford E.K.

In other studies heat shock either reduced or enhanced cytokine-stimulated NO production (29.Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Aquino D.A. Li G.C. Xu H. Reis D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17724-17732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 30.Wong H.R. Finder J.D. Wasserloos K. Pitt B.R. Am. J.

Merval R. Esposito B. Tedgui A. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 270: 115-118PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, cytokines can also induce hsp expression. In human monocytes, LPS and TNFα lead to the increased expression of hsp70 (33.Fincato G. Polentarutti N. Sica A. Mantovani A. Colotta F. Blood. 1991; 77: 579-586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar induction of hsp70 by cytokines has been reported in nonimmune cells such as rat pancreatic islets and cardiac myocytes (34.Helqvist S. Polla B.S. Johannesen J. Nerup J. Diabetologia. 1991; 34: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 35.Low-Friedrich I. Weisensee D. Mitrou P. Schoeppe W. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1992; 87: 12-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This adds to more direct evidence indicating that hsp70, as other hsp, is involved in antigen presentation and mediates the induction of T helper 1-type cytokines in immune cells thus increasing cellular immunity (36.Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 37.Todryk S. Melcher A.A. Hardwick N. Linardakis E. Bateman A. Colombo M.P. Stoppacciaro A. Vile R.G. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 1398-1408PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the detection of antibodies against hsp in some autoimmune disorders including type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus suggests that hsp are implicated in the autoimmune disease process (38.Ozawa Y. Kasuga A. Nomaguchi H. Maruyama T. Kasatani T. Shimada A. Takei I. Miyazaki J. Saruta T. J. Autoimmun. 1996; 9: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39.Tishler M. Shoenfeld Y. Semin. Arthritis Rheum. 1996; 26: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).In the present study, we investigated the possible role of hsp70 as a modulator of the cellular response to cytokines using iNOS as a model system for cytokine inducible genes. In two different rodent cell types, we showed that hsp70 increased the expression of iNOS and the production of nitric oxide. Furthermore, we provide evidence that this effect results from an hsp70-mediated enhancement of the activation of p38 by cytokines suggesting a novel role for hsp70 as a p38-dependent modulator of inflammatory responses.DISCUSSIONThe work presented in this study stemmed from the observation that heat shock, while causing an initial inhibition of cytokine-induced NO production, resulted at 24 h post-treatment in an enhanced response to cytokines. An inhibition of the cytokine response early after heat shock has been observed previously in different cell types such as rat lung, liver, smooth muscle cells, or glial cells (29.Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Aquino D.A. Li G.C. Xu H. Reis D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17724-17732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 30.Wong H.R. Finder J.D. Wasserloos K. Pitt B.R.

Hepatology. 1996; 24: 1238-1245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and likely results at least in part from initial heat-induced damage. Protein denaturation during heat shock is the trigger for hsp gene transcription. Accumulation of chaperone hsp which bind denatured proteins and assist refolding, facilitates cell recovery. Eventually, accumulation of hsp is also responsible for turning off hsp transcription (57.Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). In the present study, we presented strong evidence that elevated expression of hsp70 after heat shock can modify the cellular response to cytokines. RIN and WEHI cells overexpressing hsp70 produced 2 to 3 times more NO than control cells after treatment with IL-1β or a combination of LPS and IFN-γ, respectively. The enhanced NO production did not result from a mere stabilization of iNOS activity through hsp70 chaperone function. Hsp70-mediated enhancement of NO production was accompanied by an increased transcriptional activity of the iNOS gene and an increased accumulation of iNOS mRNA and protein. Furthermore, the effect appears specific to hsp70, since overexpression of another hsp, hsp27, produced no enhancement of NO production (data not shown).Besides the well documented hsp70 chaperone activity (5.Bukau B.

Here we found that hsp70 expression enhanced LPS/IFN-γ or IL-1β-induced p38 MAP kinase activation in WEHI cells. A similar effect was also observed in RIN cells exposed to IL-1β (data not shown). The effect of hsp70 on p38 activation was concentration dependent. It increased proportionally with the concentration of hsp70 in transiently transfected cells. Furthermore, in cells constitutively expressing hsp70, the enhanced p38 activation could be abrogated by expression of a hsp70 antisense construct. The effect was also specific to p38. Hsp70 overexpression had no effect on cytokine-induced JNK or ERK activation. Finally the effect was specific to cytokines. In the same cells, hsp70 antagonized hydrogen peroxide or heat shock-induced p38 activation.The mechanisms responsible for the opposite effect of hsp70 on stress activation versus receptor-mediated activation of the p38 signaling pathway is unclear. In the case of stress activation, it is conceivable that the hsp70 inhibitory effects result from an inhibition of the initial damaging event that is responsible for triggering p38 activation. For example, hsp70 was shown to block apoptosis and p38 can be activated downstream of some apoptotic events (9.Jäättelä M. Wissing D. Kokholm K. Kallunki T. Egeblad M.

The findings that hsp70 also reduced activation of the p38-activating kinases MKK3/6 and MKK4 support the view that hsp70 does not act directly on p38 but instead at a level more proximal to the initial triggering event. Thus the action of hsp70 on p38 activation is different from its action on JNK. The inhibition of JNK activation by hsp70 was reported to result from a protection mediated by hsp70 at the level of a JNK phosphatase that is sensitive to protein damaging agents (63.Meriin A.B. Yaglom J.A. Gabai V.L. Zon L. Ganiatsas S. Mosser D.D. Sherman M.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2547-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In that study, the mechanism for the inhibition of p38 activation was not identified but was shown to be different. In contrast, in the case of receptor-mediated activation of p38, a chaperone activity of hsp70 at the level of signaling elements that contribute positively to p38 activation may prevail. There are a few reports indicating an association of hsp70 with the proximal elements of signaling pathways other than p38. For example, hsp70 together with hsp90 associate with the inactive glucocorticoid receptor, keeping it in a competent state for activation (64.Dittmar K.D. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13047-13054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Hsp70 is also associated with the scaffold complex formed of the kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR), the ERK MAP kinase kinases MEK1 and MEK2 and other proteins (65.Stewart S. Sundaram M. Zhang Y. Lee J. Han M. Guan K.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5523-5534Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Hsp70 was found to bind and increase the stability of the MAP kinase kinase kinase MOS (66.Liu H. Vuyyuru V.B. Pham C.D. Yang Y. Singh B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3461-3470Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Similarly, elevated expression of the chaperone hsp70 may stabilize or promote the formation of signaling complexes linking cytokine receptors to the p38 activation cascade, resulting in an enhanced activation. Our results showing that hsp70 enhances the activation of p38-activating kinases support such an action of hsp70 early in the signaling pathway.The study also indicated that the increased activation of p38 was responsible for the hsp70-mediated enhancement of cytokine-induced iNOS expression. The additional iNOS mRNA which accumulated in a hsp70-dependent manner was abolished in the presence of the p38 inhibitor SB203580. Interestingly, p38 activity was not found to play a major role in the basal expression of iNOS in control cells but was responsible for the enhancing effect observed in hsp70-transfected cells. Similar results were obtained in the RIN cell model stimulated by IL-1β. In these cells overexpression of hsp70 enhanced cytokine-induced transcription of a luciferase reporter gene containing the cytokine-regulated elements of the rat iNOS gene. The enhancement was totally abolished in the presence of the p38 inhibitor, suggesting that the hsp70-mediated effect occurred at the level of transcription and was in major part regulated by p38.The role of the MAP kinases and in particular p38 in modulating iNOS expression has been investigated in several studies. Varying results have been obtained which likely resulted from the different nature of the cell lines and agonists used, but also from the complexity of the regulatory mechanisms of iNOS regulation and the multitude of targets of p38 which can influence iNOS expression. In macrophages activated by LPS/IFN-γ, as we found here in control WEHI cells, inhibition p38 activity had little effect on iNOS expression (67.Caivano M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 68.Chan E.D. Winston B.W. Uh S.T. Wynes M.W. Rose D.M. Riches D.W. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 415-422PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases, however, as we found here in the hsp70 overexpressing cells, inhibition of p38 led to a partial inhibition of the response (23.Da Silva J. Pierrat B. Mary J.L. Lesslauer W. J. Biol.

The murine iNOS promoter contains several regulatory elements, of which at least three bind transcriptional factors known to be regulated by the p38 pathway and to be essential for full expression of iNOS. The iNOS promoter contains two NF-κB binding motifs. Upon activation, NF-kB translocates to the nucleus and binds to DNA. p38 has little effect on the binding activity but contributes to NF-kB mediated transactivation (15.Beyaert R. Cuenda A.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3285-3290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). The most distal region of the iNOS promoter contains 2 regions directly and indirectly regulated by STAT1: an IFN-stimulated response element which binds IFN regulatory factor-1, a factor which is newly synthesized in cells after stimulation with LPS/IFN-γ (22.Faure V. Hecquet C. Courtois Y. Goureau O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4794-4800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and requires STAT1 for its own transcriptional activation, and a IFN-γ-activated site which binds STAT1 dimers directly (73.Decker T. Kovarik P. Meinke A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Targeted disruption of the STAT1 gene abolishes completely the response to IFN-γ (74.Meraz M.A. White J.M. Sheehan K.C. Bach E.A. Rodig S.J. Dighe A.S. Kaplan D.H. Riley J.K. Greenlund A.C. Campbell D. Carver-Moore K. DuBois R.N. Clark R. Aguet M. Schreiber R.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 431-442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that p38 plays a key role in the phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 727 and the activation of its transcriptional activity (21.Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 75.Gollob J.A. Schnipper C.P. Murphy E.A. Ritz J. Frank D.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4472-4481PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, p38 activity might enhance iNOS transcription directly through STAT1 acting at the IFN-γ-activated site but also indirectly at the IFN-stimulated response element since blocking p38 activity impairs STAT1 dependent accumulation of IFN regulatory factor-1 after IFN-γ stimulation (22.Faure V. Hecquet C. Courtois Y. Goureau O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4794-4800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In many of these studies, inhibition of p38 activity led to partial inhibition whereas constitutive activation of p38 led to a major enhancement of the response. Thus any factor which like hsp70 can enhance p38 activation would be expected to increase importantly the expression of iNOS. Intriguingly, an insulin-dependent enhancement of iNOS gene expression coupled with an enhancement of p38 activation was also observed in glomerular mesengial cells stimulated with IL-1β (76.Guan Z. Buckman S.Y. Baier L.D. Morrison A.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F673-F679Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).NO is an important mediator in inflammation and autoimmune diseases (49.Kröncke K.D.

The upstream sequence of the gene coding for human CK2α (CSNK1A1, chromosomal location 20p13) has been examined for promoter location and transcription factor interactions using reporter gene assays (luciferase; HeLa cells), site-directed mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, super-shifts, UV cross-linking, Western blotting, and DNA affinity chromatography. Highest promoter activity has been found in a region comprising positions −9 to 46. Factors Sp1, Ets-1, and NF-κB have been identified as interaction partners and, by mutation of individual sites and simultaneous mutations of two or more sites, shown to cross-talk to each other. At least two of the factors (Sp1; NF-κB) were susceptible to phosphorylation by CK2 holoenzyme, a tetramer composed of two CK2α and two regulatory CK2β proteins, but not by individual CK2α. Because the phosphorylation decreases promoter binding and repeated immunoprecipitation reveals presence of “free” CK2β in cell extracts, it is tempting to speculate that the gene product CK2α might readily form CK2 holoenzyme and feed back onto gene transcription. The data represent the first promoter control analysis of a mammalian CK2α gene and provide a hypothesis of how the constant expression level of CK2α may be achieved.

CK2 occurs in two highly related isoforms, CK2α and CK2α′. Both of these occur as tetrameric holoenzymes complexed stoichiometrically to regulatory CK2β proteins. This tetrameric structure is also highly conserved and required for appropriate control of substrate specificity. Although a considerable number of substrates has been documented, comprising proteins involved in processes such as transcription, replication, translation, and signaling, the exact physiological role of CK2 remains poorly understood. However, CK2 has been linked to proliferation, transformation, and cell cycle regulation (reviewed in Refs. 1.Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 95-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The expression of CK2 proteins appears to be kept quite constant throughout tissues, and deviations have been related to diseased states. There is accumulating evidence that CK2α may, under certain cellular conditions, exert harmful effects; the targeted overexpression of CK2α in T cells of transgenic mice, for instance, results in the development of lymphomas, a situation paralleled by Theileria parva-infected bovine lymphocytes (11.Ole-MoiYoi O.K. Science. 1995; 267: 834-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Misregulation of CK2α works synergistically with oncogenes such as Myc and Tal-1 in lymphoma development (12.Seldin D.C. Leder P. Science. 1995; 267: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 13.Kelliher M.A. Seldin D.C. Leder P.

Seldin D.C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2965-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore control of CK2α expression is a subject of particular importance. The human genome contains two CK2α loci, at chromosomes 20p13 and 11p15. Only the 20p13 locus seems to be transcriptionally active; the other appears to be a pseudogene remaining permanently silent despite the presence of potential promoter elements in the 5′ region (15.Wirkner U. Voss H. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. Genomics. 1998; 48: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16.Wirkner U. Pyerin W. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 191: 59-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have been successful in unraveling the structure of the active CK2α gene, a gene spanning roughly 70 kilobases (15.Wirkner U. Voss H. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. Genomics. 1998; 48: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The promoter of the active gene has been located within a region comprising positions −256 to 144. The promoter shows features of a so-called housekeeping gene: no TATA box, presence of GC boxes, a CpG island around exon 1, and more than one, namely two, transcription start sites located at positions +1 and 50 (15, 16). Although the term housekeeping implies permanent expression with little regulation, even highly tissue-specific regulation has been shown to occur with this type of promoter. (e.g. with the promoter of peptidyl peptidase IV gene (17.Boehm S.K. Gum J.R. Erickson R.H. Hicks J.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 835-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or the promoter of platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (18.Gumina R.J. Kirschbaum N.E. Piotrowski K. Newman P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1260-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In this context it was interesting that in addition to the potential cis-acting elements typical for housekeeping promoters, potential binding sites for transcription factors such as NF-κB or AP2 are also present in the CK2α gene promoter. Whether these have a physiological significance has not yet been determined. We demonstrate here that three of those factors, Sp1, NF-κB, and Ets1, bind to the promoter, are mutually interactive, and could be decisive in controlling the expression of the CK2α gene. In addition, the data seem to indicate the possibility for an autoregulatory loop of CK2α expression via phosphorylation of these transcription factors by CK2 holoenzyme formed upon complexation of the gene product CK2α to the regulatory protein CK2β. pGL3-vector system, luciferase and β-galactosidase assay kits, and recombinant transcription factors were purchased from Promega. Stratagene was the provider of Pfu-turbo polymerase and the Quick Change site-directed mutagenesis kit; enzymes originated from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Stratagene, and MBI Fermentas. Chromatography material and Hybond-C membrane was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Microcon filtration units were from Amicon, and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Millipore. Radioactive labeled nucleotides were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Plasmid kits, fetal calf serum, LipofectAMINE, and media were from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals originated from Roth, Sigma, and Merck. Construction of Luciferase Reporter Gene Vectors—Oligonucleotides derived from the sense and antisense strand of CK2α promoter regions (see Fig. 1) were synthesized (oligonucleotide synthesis group, DKFZ, Heidelberg) with additional terminal adapter sequences of XmaI, BglII, orKpnI/HindIII restriction sites and cloned into the multiple cloning site of pGL3 basic, enhancer, and promoter vectors (Promega). Correct insertion and orientation was confirmed by sequencing. Promoter sequences that were too long for synthesis (>100 base pairs) were created by deletion mutagenesis from α promoter insert −256/144. The QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis method of Stratagene was used for modifying defined nucleotides in CK2α promoter sequences previously inserted as wild type sequence into pGL3 vectors. Mutagenic exchange was confirmed by sequencing. Recloning of modified CK2α promoter inserts into pGL3 vectors eliminated any risk of random mutations in the vector sequence that might lead to altered reporter gene activity. HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in six-well plates to reach 60–80% confluence at the time of transfection. Before transfection LipofectAMINE (4 μg/well) was incubated with 4 μg of the respective luciferase vector and 1 μg of a β-galactosidase reporter gene vector for 35 min in a volume of 50 μl of Opti-MEM and added to each well. Medium was adjusted to 10% fetal calf serum after 5 h and incubation for another 17 h followed. Cells were harvested in 120 μl of cell lysis buffer (Promega), and an ensuing 1-min centrifugation step (20,000 ×g) yielded a luciferase-containing supernatant. In both cases aliquots of 20-μl supernatant were tested for luciferase activity (luciferase assay kit, Promega) and for β-galactosidase activity (β-galactosidase assay kit, Promega) to adjust for transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to Dignam et al. (19.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar) and filtered (0.2 μm filters). Buffer exchange and desalting was achieved in one step with HiTrap desalting columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In the case of affinity chromatography, desalting columns were arranged in line with DNA affinity columns and removed immediately after proteins had passed through. N-Hydroxysuccinimide-activated fast protein liquid chromatography columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used for coupling oligonucleotides of 4-fold repeats of CK2α promoter regions to be investigated, adapting the manufacturer's protocol for coupling of peptides. The coupling procedure was prolonged to 24 h at 4 °C. Finally, the columns were washed and equilibrated (19.Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9132) Google Scholar). Columns were arranged in line in an automated fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and HeLa S3 nuclear extracts (750 μg of total protein in 250 μl volume) were chromatographically separated. Poly(dI-dC) (50 μg/ml) was added to abolish nonspecific binding of nuclear proteins to DNA. The run-through was re-applied for at least 3 times before bound proteins were eluted by a linear gradient from 0 to 1 m KCl, followed by a step with 2 m KCl. Eluates were concentrated to equal volumes using Microcon concentrators (Amicon). Samples were applied on 12% SDS-PAGE (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and either run at 200 V (constant) for 47 min or at 11 mA (constant) for 16–18 h. Gels of UV-cross-linking experiments were Coomassie-stained; all others were either dried and autoradiographed directly or used for semi-dry blotting on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for immunological detection of separated proteins (21.Kyhse-Andersen J. J. Biochem. Biophys. Methods. 1984; 10: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar). In the latter case the membranes were either blocked with a solution containing 1 μg of polyvinyl alcohol/ml in phosphate-buffered saline or overnight with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% milk powder. Membranes were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with specific antibodies (diluted 1:4,000 for anti-α329–343; 1:2,000 for anti-α′, and 1:10,000 for anti-β171–186; anti-Ets1, anti-Sp1, and anti-NF-κB-antibodies were diluted 1:1,500) treated with protein A-biotin (1:10,000) for 45 min at room temperature and followed by a 1-h incubation with peroxidase-coupled streptavidin. All steps were followed by 4 washings for 5 min (22.Krehan A. Lorenz P. Plana-Coll M. Pyerin W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4966-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 23.Krehan A. Meggio F. Pipkorn R. Pinna L.A. Pyerin W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 667-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Detection was achieved using 4-chloronaphthol as substrate (24.Kobayashi R. Tashima Y. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Anti-peptide antibodies against CTCF were generated in a procedure described previously (22.Krehan A. Lorenz P. Plana-Coll M. Pyerin W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4966-4975Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For CTCF, amino acids 2–12 of human sequence EGDAVEAIVEES served as antigenic determinant. End-labeled double-strand oligonucleotides of 14–23 base pairs in length (40,000 cpm/reaction) shown to have a positive binding capacity for nuclear proteins in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) technique were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 12.5 μg of nuclear extracts prepared from HeLa S3 nuclei in a volume of 50 μl. The incubation mixture was identically composed as in EMSA. Samples cooled to 0 °C in an ice-water bath were exposed to 254-nm UV light for 4 times 15 min with 20-min intervals, 5-fold SDS sample buffer was added, and samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min before separating cross-linked products on a 12% SDS-PAGE (11 mA constant for 18 h). Gels were Coomassie-stained for detection of marker bands, then dried and autoradiographed. Oligonucleotides representing 14–23-mer CK2α promoter were synthesized in sense and antisense orientation, annealed, and end-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase (MBI Fermentas). Surplus radioactivity was removed by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Microspin columns. Gel-shift assays were performed using 40,000 cpm of32P end-labeled oligonucleotides and 5 μg of HeLa S3 nuclear extracts per assay in a final volume of 20 μl. The presence of poly(dI-dC) prevented nonspecific protein-DNA binding. All other components were taken from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech gel-shift kit. An incubation for 20 min preceded electrophoretic separation on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel (100 V constant) at 4 °C. For super-shift EMSAs, native 3.5% polyacrylamide gels were run. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. For competition reactions with unlabeled oligonucleotides, the latter were added in 25- or 100-fold surplus depending on the nature of the oligonucleotide. Competitor oligonucleotides had the sequences: AP2, GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT; Ets1, GATCTCGAGCAGGAAGTTCGA; NF-κB, AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC; CTCF, TCGGCCGCCCCCTCGCGGCGCGCC; GCF, TGGTGGGTGGTGAGGGGGCGGGGGTGG; Sp1, AATCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC). For super-shift analyses appropriate amounts of antibody (as suggested by the supplier) were added to the samples and preincubated on ice for a minimum of 30 min before labeled oligonucleotide was added, and standard incubation for 20 min at room temperature followed. HeLa cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (37 °C, 95% humidity, 5% CO2). For immunoprecipitation experiments, near-confluent cells from 10-cm dishes were lysed in 190 μl of radioimmune precipitation buffer (supplemented with 150 μm aprotinin, 200 μm AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride), 1 mmbenzamidine, 10 μm EDTA, 28 μm E-64, and 20 μm leupeptin), aspirated 10 × through an 18-gauge needle, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g (4 °C, 15 min). Supernatants were used for immunoprecipitations. SDS-PAGE and Western blot were performed as described above. 20 pmol of the respective antibody per assay and 40 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added to 500 μl of HeLa cell extracts obtained from 10 dishes. After agitation by rotation for 60 min (4 °C) and centrifugation (6000 × g, 1 min), the supernatant was used for three repeated immunoprecipitation reactions. In a subsequent fourth immunoprecipitation reaction (4 °C, overnight), an antibody against the respective other CK2 subunit was applied. Sedimented protein-A agarose beads were washed 6 times in radioimmune precipitation buffer at all steps, 35 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min. Band intensities were determined by scanning films used for chemiluminescent detection. Different amounts of recombinant CK2 subunits (0.1 to 1.0 pmol) were used to calculate a standard curve for each individual blot. Quantification was supported by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). Recombinant transcription factors (2 pmol each) were phosphorylated by 0.02 pmol of either CK2α or CK2 holoenzyme in a final volume of 10 μl for 30 min at 30 °C in a Tris-buffered solution (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). 0.4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP per assay served as phosphoryl group donor. The reaction was stopped by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie staining, the gel was dried and autoradiographed. For generation of CK2-phosphorylated Sp1 for EMSA analysis, 2 footprinting units of Sp1 (Promega) were phosphorylated in the presence of 100 mm MOPS, pH 6.9, 80 μmATP, 10 mm MgCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C. The region comprising positions −256 to 144 (−256/144) has been shown to contain the promoter of the human CK2α gene (15.Wirkner U. Voss H. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. Genomics. 1998; 48: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To identify the decisive segment, region −256/144 was sequentially deleted from either end. The resulting segments were cloned into pGL3 luciferase reporter gene vectors (pGL3 BV) and tested for promoter activity in HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 1 A, deletion of the 3′ end to provide segment −256/65 had no significant effect; 92% of promoter activity remained. When deletion was extended to give segment −256/−40, a complete loss of activity was observed. Deletion of the 5′ end to provide segment −69/144 resulted in a roughly 20% decrease of promoter activity. The activity remained practically unaltered when deletion was extended to give segments −39/144 and −26/144. Stepwise further deletion then led to a moderate further decrease with segment −9/144 (66% activity), then dropped to half with segment 10/144 (32% activity) and to zero level with segment 47/144 (complete inactivity was previously observed with segment 45/144 (15.Wirkner U. Voss H. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. Genomics. 1998; 48: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar)). Thus, the 3′ deletion data seemed to locate promoter activity to positions −39 to 65, which may be narrowed down for a main activity segment comprising positions segment −9 to 46. In addition, the presence of enhancer activity upstream of position −39 (segment −256/−70) was indicated. To verify this assumption, region −256/144 was divided into five short segments, including segment −9/46, and the segments were cloned into a luciferase reporter gene vector containing an enhancer element (pGL3 EV) in order to detect even minor promoter activities. Highest activity was obtained with the construct containing segment −9/46, showing 91% of the activity of region −256/144 (Fig. 1 B). The three segments 5′ of −9/46 (−69/−10, −144/−70, −145/−256) were inactive, and the adjacent 3′ sequence (segment 47/144) had only slight promoter activity (13% activity). In addition, two segments overlapping with segment −9/46 were tested, −39/13 containing transcription start site 1 and 10/65 containing transcription start site 2. They both showed promoter activity but were less than half as active as segment −9/46 (42% and 33%, respectively). It was concluded that the promoter activity of the CK2α gene is located within a region ranging from positions −39 to 65, that segment −9/46 was the most active part, and that there exist functional contexts between segments −39/13 and 10/65. The upstream region of the human CK2α gene contains putative binding sites for various transcription factors, including sites for Sp1, GCF, Ets1, AP2 and NF-κB (15.Wirkner U. Voss H. Ansorge W. Pyerin W. Genomics. 1998; 48: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and CTCF (HUSAR program, DKFZ Heidelberg). When nuclear extracts (NEs) of HeLa cells were tested for their presence by Western blotting, signals were obtained for factors AP2, Ets1, NF-κB (both forms, p50 and p65), and Sp1 (data not shown). (GCF and CTCF antibodies were not commercially available, and our own efforts to raise peptide antibodies were unsuccessful). To examine its capability of binding proteins present in NEs, the upstream region was divided into nine overlapping segments of 14 to 23 base pairs in length synthesized as oligonucleotides and employed in EMSAs. Segments were selected according to the location of potential transcription factor binding sites, avoiding destruction of motifs (Fig. 2 A). When incubated with NEs, strong protein binding occurred with oligonucleotides −26/−8, −7/11, 12/27, and 18/40. Binding, although considerably weaker, was also obtained with oligonucleotides 7/22 and 28/45, whereas oligonucleotides −41/−22 and 23/36 did not bind proteins (not shown), and oligonucleotide 46/65 only occasionally gave binding signals (hinting at DNA-protein complexes of variable stability) (Fig.2 B). Migration of the protein-DNA complexes differed significantly, indicating that different proteins had obviously interacted with these segments. The segments forming the most stable complexes contained transcription factor sites such Sp1, GCF, AP2, CTCF, NF-κB, and Ets1. However, binding sites are known to interact frequently with different factors in different contexts. Therefore, various tests were carried out to pinpoint the nature of the binding proteins. A first clue came from cross-linking studies. DNA fragments incubated with NEs followed by UV-cross-linking and SDS-gel electrophoresis led, using segment −7/11, to DNA-bound proteins with molecular masses in the range of 80–100 kDa (Fig. 3). This segment possesses Sp1 sites, and Sp1 has a molecular mass of 97 kDa. By contrast, segment 7/22 and, even more pronounced, segment 12/27, both of which are devoid of Sp1 sites but contain a CTCF site, gave a number of bands ranging from 20 to 100 kDa, the higher molecular mass bands corresponding to the 70-, 73-, 80-, and 97-kDa isoforms of CTCF (25.Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. Paterson H.F. Carne A.F. Heath C.M. Goodwin G.H. Neiman P.E. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7612-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and the anomalous migration behavior of recombinant human CTCF (26.Filippova G.N. Fagerlie S. Klenova E.M. Myers C. Dehner Y. Goodwin G. Neiman P.E. Collins S.J. Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2802-2813Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In addition, with segment 12/27, a less intense signal in the 50-kDa range and a stronger one at around 65 kDa was obtained, corresponding to the p50 and p65 subunits of NF-κB. When oligonucleotides representing binding site consensus sequences of these factors were added to EMSAs, formation of radioactive complexes showed significant competitive inhibition (data not shown). In addition, DNA fragments in which consensus motifs had been mutated showed decreased or no protein binding with NEs, as exemplified for the consensus sequences of Sp1 (both binding fragments, −26/−8 and −7/11), NF-κB, and CTCF (Fig.4 A). When EMSAs were carried out in the presence of specific antibodies, complexes obtained with segments such as −26/−8 or −7/11 containing Sp1 sites showed up-shifts in the presence of anti-Sp1 antibodies (Fig. 4 B). Shifts were also obtained with NF-κB and promoter segment 12/27 in presence of anti-NF-κB antibodies (data not shown). Using commercially available recombinant transcription factors such as Sp1 or NF-κB instead of NEs, binding was observed in EMSAs, with DNA fragments containing the respective consensus sites but not with fragments lacking those sites; results were negative for AP2 (data not shown). Finally, affinity columns were prepared by immobilizing DNA fragments to solid supports and used for a chromatographic selection of proteins present in HeLa NEs. Specificity of affinity chromatography was ensured by adding excess poly(dI-dC) to NEs in order to compete for nonspecific binding, by increasing salt concentration (to 100 mm) to help dissociate unspecific protein complexes, and by employing pre-columns containing DNA with various consensus motifs to eliminate factors prone to nonspecific DNA binding, as for instance described for factor Ku (27.Quinn J.P. Farina A.R. FEBS. 1991; 286: 225-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Eluates of columns prepared with 4-fold repeats of segments −7/11 or −26/−8, i.e. segments with Sp1 sites, contained Sp1 as demonstrated by Western blotting (Fig.5). Columns prepared with repeats of NF-κB (p65) or Ets1 resulted in Western blots positive for NF-κB or Ets1, respectively. In summary, transcription factors Sp1, Ets1, NF-κB, and CTCF appeared to be present in nuclear extracts and to interact specifically with DNA fragments that have promoter activity and contain the respective binding sites. These factors, therefore, were considered candidates for a role in transcriptional control of the CK2α gene. The segment with the strongest promoter activity, segment −9/46, contains several transcription factor binding motifs, including a cluster of Sp1 motifs (4-fold; Sp1.2), a CTCF motif, two adjacent Ets1 motifs, and two overlapping NF-κB motifs. These were examined by mutational analysis in combination with indicator gene assays (luciferase; HeLa cells) for their significance in determining promoter activity. Three or four bases each were exchanged within motifs by polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenesis to provide −9/46 segments Sp1.2mut, CTCFmut, Ets1mut, and NF-κBmut, respectively. Aside from a significant decrease or loss of protein binding (see Fig.4 A), this resulted in a gradiated effect on transcriptional activity (Fig. 6). Although activity was unchanged with Sp1.2mut and moderately decreased with CTCFmut, both Ets1mut and NF-κBmut were strongly affected; promoter activity was decreased to roughly 30% each. To detect functional linkages, double mutants were created with Ets1, NF-κB, and Sp1 sites. Although showing no effect in isolation, the Sp1.2 site mutation appeared to amplify the effect of Ets1 site mutation (Sp1.2/Ets1mut), decreasing promoter activity to 8% and indicating a possible functional linkage of Ets1 and Sp1 (Fig. 6). By contrast, the Sp1.2 site mutation had little effect on NF-κB site mutation; promoter activity of the double mutant (Sp1.2/NF-κBmut) was similar to that of the NF-κB site mutant alone or slightly higher (42% activity). When Ets1 and NF-κB sites were mutated simultaneously, promoter activity was decreased to 9%, i.e.the effect was significantly stronger than with either of the single mutations alone, indicating a possible functional cooperation between Ets1 and NF-κB as well. The differential effects of Ets1 and NF-κB mutations could be detected since particular attention was paid to the selectivity of base exchanges from adjoining motifs (28.Lodie T.A. Reiner M. Coniglio S. Viglianti G. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 268-276PubMed Google Scholar). The question then was whether these mutations would also have effects when larger DNA fragments were investigated that more closely represent the in vivo situation. Thus, mutations analogous to those in −9/46 were introduced into the largest of the genomic fragments used in the present study, region −256/144. As shown in Fig.7, mutation of Sp1 motifs had different effects. Although Sp1.1mut, a mutation within an 8-fold Sp1 cluster 20 base pairs upstream of Sp1.2, had no detectable effect on indicator gene expression, the Sp1.2mut decreased activity to 25%. CTCFmut had little impact on promoter activity, matching the moderate effect seen above with segment −9/46. Mutation of Ets1 and NF-κB sites"
https://openalex.org/W2120647427,"TAFII105, a substoichiometric coactivator subunit of TFIID, is important for activation of anti-apoptotic genes by NF-κB in response to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. In the present study we have analyzed the mechanism of TAFII105 function with respect to its regulation of p65/RelA, a component of NF-κB. We found two independent p65/RelA-binding domains within the N terminus of TAFII105. One of these domains appears to be crucial for TAFII105-mediated anti-apoptotic gene activation in response to TNF-α. Analysis of the interaction between TAFII105 and different NF-κB complexes has revealed substantial differences in the affinity of TAFII105 toward different p65/RelA-containing dimers. We have identified the TNF-α induced anti-apoptotic A20 gene as a target gene of TAFII105. A20 has a differential protective effect on cell death induced by TNF-α in the presence of either the dominant negative mutant of TAFII105 (TAFII105ΔC) or the superdominant IκBα. The results suggest that the inhibitory effect of TAFII105ΔC on NF-κB-dependent genes is restricted to a subset of anti-apoptotic genes while the effect of IκBα is more general. Thus, an interaction between NF-κB and a specific coactivator is important for specifying target gene activation.

Thus, an interaction between NF-κB and a specific coactivator is important for specifying target gene activation. tumor necrosis factor glutathione S-transferase reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction cytomegalovirus green fluorescent protein glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase An important issue in control of gene expression is the mechanism underlying the specificity of the cellular response to extracellular signals. In many cases this response is mediated by specific transcription factors that are activated by signaling pathways. In recent years considerable progress has been made in understanding the molecular mechanism by which signaling pathways regulate transcription in a variety of cellular systems. Nevertheless some serious problems remain unsolved. For instance, certain transcription factors can be activated by several distinct signals; yet, the genes induced by these factors and thus the cellular response vary significantly. The molecular basis for such differential activation of genes by specific transcription factors is not yet clear. One family of transcription factors that is activated by a broad range of extracellular signals is NF-κB. The signals include inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, interferons, major histocompatibility complex proteins, growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, viruses, and certain stress signals (1.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). NF-κB transcription factors also regulate apoptosis. They mediate activation of survival genes that protect cells from apoptosis induced by various agents such as the cytokine TNF-α1 (2.Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Verma I.M. Green D.R. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar), certain oncogenes (3.Mayo M.W. Wang C.-Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 4.Reuther J.Y. Reuther G.W. Cortez D. Pendergast A.M. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 968-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), ionizing radiation, and chemotherapeutic agents (5.Wang C-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar). However, under some circumstances, NF-κB has the opposite effect, and can activate genes that promote apoptosis (6.Sonenshein G.E. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7.Foo S.Y. Nolan G.P. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 229-235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The transcriptionally active NF-κB is a dimeric complex composed of members of the Rel family of proteins, p65/RelA, p50, c-Rel, RelB, and p52 (8.Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwep D. Miyamoto S. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2723-2735Crossref PubMed Scopus (1647) Google Scholar). In most cells, these factors are localized in the cytoplasm bound by IκB proteins, a family of inhibitory proteins that prevents nuclear transport of NF-κB proteins. Signals that activate NF-κB, such as cytokines or stress, induce phosphorylation of IκB and its subsequent degradation, thereby releasing NF-κB. NF-κB then translocates into the nucleus and activates its target genes (1.Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5510) Google Scholar). Previously we reported that hTAFII105 serves as coactivator for the p65/RelA NF-κB subunit and is required for activation of certain anti-apoptotic genes in human 293 cells (9.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This function of hTAFII105 involves direct interaction between the p65 subunit of NF-κB and the N-terminal domain of hTAFII105. In addition to hTAFII105, numerous reports have indicated that the coactivator protein CBP and its homolog p300 are also involved in transcription activation by p65 subunit of NF-κB (10.Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 11.Gerritsen M.E. Williams A.J. Neish A.S. Moore S. Shi Y. Collins T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2927-2932Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Likewise, other TFIID subunits such as hTAFII250, hTAFII80, and hTAFII28 have been reported to bind p65/RelA (12.Guermah M. Malik S. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3234-3244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, p65 was also found to interact specifically with the composite coactivator ARC/DRIP and this complex supports NF-κB dependent transcriptional activation in vitro (13.Naar A.M. Beaurang P.A. Zhou S. Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). At present it is not clear whether these coactivator complexes display redundant functions, or whether transcription activation by NF-κB utilizes each of these complexes sequentially. We report here a detailed analysis of TAFII105-p65/RelA physical and functional interaction. Our findings suggest that TAFII105 is involved in activation of only a subset of NF-κB genes and this selective effect of TAFII105 is associated with preference for selected forms of p65/RelA complexes. These results reveal the importance of combinatorial interactions between activators and coactivators for differential target gene activation. The N-terminal fragments of TAFII105 were expressed as GST fusion in Escherichia coli. The recombinant proteins were purified and immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. 35S-Labeled p65 was synthesized in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase and rabbit reticulocytes lysate (Promega TNT kit), and incubated with the different GST purified proteins in 0.1 m KCl HEMG buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed 3 times with the same buffer and twice with 0.2 mKCl HEMG buffer. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in protein sample buffer 5 min followed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Nuclear extracts (50 μl, 15 μg/μl) from BJAB cells in 0.1m HEMG + 0.1% Nonidet P-40 were incubated with GST105ΔC or with GST beads as described above. After the washes, bound proteins were eluted with 1 m NaCl HEMG, loaded on SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by Western blot, using anti-p65 and anti-p50 antibodies (Santa Cruz). pCMV-TAFII105, pCMV-TAFII105ΔC-(1–552) and pCMV-TAFII105ΔC-(1–452) were previously described (9.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). TAFII105ΔC-(Δ453–471) was constructed by ligating a PCR fragment encoding amino acid 472–552 to the 3′ of TAFII105ΔC-(1–452) digested with HindIII and filled in. GST-TAFII105ΔC-(1–552) was described previously. GST-TAFII105-(211–358) was constructed by ligating a Sau3A-PvuII fragment intoBamHI-SmaI of pGEX2TK. GST-TAFII105-(350–445) was constructed by ligating anHaeIII fragment-(1048–1335) into StuI site of pGEX2TKN. The DNA encoding amino acids 411–552 was generated by PCR and cloned into NcoI-EcoRI sites of pGEX2TKN. GST-TAFII105-(411–445) was generated by digesting 411–552 with NcoI and HaeIII and ligating into pGEX2TKN digested with NcoI and StuI. 445–552 is anHaeIII-EcoRI fragment from GST-TAFII105-(1–552) cloned intoStuI-EcoRI of pGEX2TKN. The fragment encoding amino acids 472–552 was generated by PCR and cloned into theSmaI-BamHI digest of pGEX3. The cDNA encoding the A20 gene (2.4 kilobases) was obtained by PCR from human Daudi cDNA library. The 5′ oligonucleotide was AGTCCTTCCTCAGGCTTTGTA; and the 3′ oligonucleotide, CCCACTTCTTGCAGGAGGTGA. To construct the A20 expression plasmid, CMV-A20, the cDNA was cloned in pCGN vector inSmaI site. The insert was sequenced and expression was verified by Western blot using anti-hemagglutinin antibody (data not shown). To generate the A20 luciferase reporter plasmid, aPstI fragment from A20-CAT (a gift of Dr. Dixit, V), spanning the proximal promoter region, was cloned in thePstI site of pLuc, a promoter-less reporter plasmid. The NF-κB deleted A20 promoter was generatd by PCR. Total RNA was prepared from 293 cells, untreated or treated with TNF-α for 1–3 h, using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), according the manufacturers instructions. To determine the effect of TAFII105 and IκB on A20 mRNA, subconfluent 293T cells in 100-mm plates were transfected with 3.5 μg of the different expression plasmids in a total of 10 μg of DNA. RNA preparations were treated with RQ1 DNase I (Promega) to avoid contamination of genomic and transfected DNAs. First strand cDNA and PCR amplification were performed in a single tube using the Access RT-PCR System (Promega). The oligonucleotides used for RT-PCR are: GAPDH forward, TTGTCATCAATGGAAATCCC; GAPDH reverse, TGTCGCTGTTGAAGTCAG; A20 forward, CACACAAGGCACTTGGATCC; A20reverse, CAGGATGTTCTTGCAGGAGG; A1 forward, CAAGACTTTGCTCTCCACCA; A1 reverse, GGCAATCGTTTCCATATCAGT;MnSOD forward, ATGTTACAGCCCAGACAGC; MnSODreverse, TTCAATCACTTGCCCAATAA; IEX-1L forward, AGGCAACTTGAACTCAGAACA; IEX-1L reverse, CTCGCAGCCACCCTAA;Bcl-xL forward, ACCCATCCTGGCACCTGGCA; Bcl-xLreverse, GGATCCAAGGCTCTAGGTGG; cIAP2 forward, GAAATAAGGGAAGAGGAGAG; cIAP2 reverse, TACGAACTGTACCCTTGATT. Oligonucleotides used as probes for the RT-PCR products wereGAPDH, TGAAGCAGGCGTCGGAGGGC, and A20, AGATCCCTCGCGGCTCGTCC. 293 cells are embryonic kidney fibroblasts. 293T cells express SV40 large T-antigen and therefore allow replication of plasmids bearing SV40 origin. 293, 293T, and HT1080 cell lines were maintained in F-12 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using the standard Ca/PO4method. For apoptosis assays, 293 cells were transfected in 6-well plates using a total of 3 μg of plasmid DNA/transfection. Transfections were performed with 0.2–0.6 μg of p65 DNA; 0.5–0.6 μg of TAFII105 or TAFII105ΔC DNA; 0.5–0.6 of IκB DNA and 0.3–0.5 μg of A20. Reporter assays were performed as described previously (9.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The amount of the different activator plasmids varied between 5 and 20 ng, and TAFII105 plasmid used was 300–500 ng/well. In each transfection the amount of CMV containing plasmid was kept constant. Luciferase activity was determined according to the manuacturer's protocol (Promega). Nuclear extracts were prepared as described (38.Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar) from 293 cells treated with 10 ng/ml TNF-α for 1 h, or 48 h after transfection of NF-κB subunits as indicated. A double stranded oligonucleotide, containing the NF-κB site was labeled with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I as probe. The oligonucleotides sequence is: 5′-GATCCAGAGGGGACTTTTCCGAGAG-3′; 5′-GATCCTCTCGGAAAGTCCCCTCTG-3′. Purified recombinant GST or GST-TAFII105 fragments (1 μg) were added to the binding reaction together with the DNA probe and incubated at room temperature for 30 min before loading onto the gel. For the survival analysis 293 cells in 6-well plates were co-transfected with pBabe-GFP reporter plasmid (50–100 ng) together with the indicated expression vectors (500 ng each). TNF-α (5 ng/ml) was added 12–24 h after transfection and 48–60 h after transfection cells were visualized by microscope for green fluorescent cell detection. The number of GFP cells was determined by counting three different randomly chosen fields. TNF-α induction stimulates a protein synthesis independent apoptotic response. In cells resistant to the TNF-α cytotoxic effect, it also induces expression of proteins that block apoptosis and this activation is mediated by NF-κB. TAFII105 interacts with the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB and is involved in activation of NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes in human 293 cells (9.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To examine the mechanism of TAFII105 action with respect to NF-κB, we mapped the domain within the TAFII105 N terminus directing the interaction with p65/RelA. For this purpose various fragments of TAFII105 N-terminal domain were cloned in front of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene (Fig.1 A). The different fusion proteins were purified from E. coli and used for an in vitro pull-down assay with 35S-labeled p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 1 B). This analysis revealed two p65/RelA-binding regions within TAFII105 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 6). Quantitation of the relative binding indicated that the C-terminal-binding domain interacts with p65/RelA more efficiently. Further deletion analysis of the major p65/RelA-binding site indicated that the amino acid residues between 445 and 472 are crucial for p65 binding (lanes 7–12). Based on the binding experiments we constructed mammalian expression plasmids carrying mutated variants of TAFII105ΔC, a dominant negative form of TAFII105 (Fig.2 A). We next analyzed the inhibitory effect of TAFII105ΔC mutants on p65/RelA-mediated transcription activation in 293 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the TAFII105ΔC mutant lacking the major p65-binding domain is a less potent inhibitor of p65/RelA transcription activity than the mutants carrying p65-binding domain (columns 3–5). Next, we examined the effect of these mutants on NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic gene activation in response to the cytokine TNF-α. We used the green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression assay to measure cell viability of transfected cells (Fig. 2 D). A significant reduction in cell viability in response to TNF-α is observed in cells expressing any form of TAFII105ΔC containing the p65/RelA binding (Fig.2 D) as occurred also in cells expressing superdominant IκB (Fig. 7). We confirmed that this effect is related to programmed cell death by analyzing the genomic DNA of cells expressing TAFII105ΔC and induced with TNF-α (Fig. 2 E). The DNA ladder characteristic to apoptotic response is clearly observed in cells expressing TAFII105ΔC and stimulated with TNF-α (lane 5) while no DNA fragmentation appeared in TNF-α-induced 293 cells transfected with empty expression vector (lane 3). Notably, the survival of 293 cells seems to be partially dependent on the constitutive nuclear NF-κB activity since expression of either superdominant IκB (Fig. 7) or TAFII105ΔC (Fig. 2 D) reduces by 20–30% cell survival of transfected cells without providing external apoptotic signal. TAFII105ΔC lacking the p65/RelA-binding region failed to inhibit the basal as well as TNF-α induced anti-apoptotic gene activation and to sensitize cells to TNF-α cytotoxic effect (Fig. 2 D, columns 7–10). These results suggest that the p65-binding domain of TAFII105 is crucial for its anti-apoptotic function.Figure 7Effect of A20 expression on survival of TNF -α-induced cells. A, human 293T cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids as indicated in the bottom of each column, and the GFP expression plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection TNF-α was added and 48 h later green fluorescent cells from three fields were counted. These results are average of four independent transfection experiments.

A possible regulatory mechanism for specifying gene transcription would be if various combinations of NF-κB dimers display differential coactivator binding. We have compared the relative binding of TAFII105 to different forms of NF-κB complexes: constitutive, TNF-α induced, and transfected NF-κB dimers. Nuclear extracts, prepared from control, TNF-α-induced, and NF-κB-transfected 293 cells, were used in electrophoresis mobility shift assays with a labeled oligonucleotide specific to the NF-κB-binding site. The DNA binding reaction was incubated with TAFII105 recombinant fragment which included the major p65-binding domain (GST-(445–551)). A mutated TAFII105 protein lacking the p65-binding region (GST-(470–551)) was used as a control (Fig.3). As expected, strong NF-κB binding activity was detected following TNF-α induction or transfection of various NF-κB members (Fig. 3, A and C). TNF-α induced the formation of two major NF-κB binding complexes (Fig. 3 A). Using antibodies directed against different subunits of the NF-κB family, we identified the low mobility complex as a homodimer of p65 and the faster migrating complex as a p65/p50 subunit heterodimer (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, among the TNF-α induced NF-κB complexes, the p65/p65 homodimer but not the p65/p50 complex formed a ternary supershifted complex with the wild type although not with the p65-binding site-deleted TAFII105 peptide (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6–9). The formation of the supershifted complex is accompanied with 53% reduction in the intensity of p65/p65 complex and less significant reduction in the intensity of p65/p50 complex (5%) as determined by densitometric analysis (see also Fig. 3 A, short exposure). Similarly, the constitutive NF-κB complex which is also composed of a p65 homodimer (data not shown), bound TAFII105 efficiently (Fig. 3 A, lanes 10–12). Incubation of p65 homodimeric complex derived from transfected cells with the GST-(445–552) TAFII105 fragment resulted in a weaker p65 complex (Fig.3 A, lane 5, 38% reduction). A weak ternary supershifted complex could be seen only after prolonged exposure (data not shown). It is likely that this ternary complex is not stable under the electrophoresis conditions indicating this type of p65 homodimeric complex bound TAFII105 less efficiently than native p65/p65 complex such as the TNF-α induced or the constitutive p65/p65 complex (Fig. 3 A compare lanes 5–9 and 12). This suggests that the affinity of TAFII105 for the p65 homodimer may also be regulated, perhaps by signaling pathways. p65/p50 or p50/p50 dimers derived from transfected cells were impaired in TAFII105 association in this assay (Fig. 3 C, lanes 3–6). In contrast, the p65/c-Rel heterodimer did bind to TAFII105 (Fig. 3 C, lanes 7–9). To further test the association of TAFII105 with NF-κB proteins we used nuclear extract prepared from the B cell line BJAB. This extract was incubated with immobilized TAFII105 (N terminus, amino acid 1–552) and bound NF-κB subunits were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies specific to either p65 or p50 subunits of NF-κB. As shown in Fig. 4, only p65 but not p50 was specifically retained on TAFII105 containing beads. Since this BJAB extract contains p65/p50 complex (data not shown), this experiment further confirms the preference of TAFII105 to p65 dimers devoid of the p50 subunit. Taken together these findings indicate that NF-κB dimers vary in their affinity to TAFII105. Numerous studies have indicated that NF-κB anti-apoptosis involves activation of several genes that inhibit, partially or fully, the TNF-α cell death response. In an attempt to identify anti-apoptotic gene(s) targeted by TAFII105 in 293 cells, we first examined the expression of these genes in response to short term TNF-α induction using RT-PCR. We analyzed the manganese superoxide dismutase gene (14.Wong G.H. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1989; 58: 923-931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar), theA20 gene (15.Opipari A.W. Hu J.R. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) andIEX-1L (19.Wu M.X. Ao Z. Prasad K.V.S. Wu R. Schlossman S.F. Science. 1998; 281: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We also tested the expression of BclXL, an anti-apoptotic gene that is not induced by TNF-α and the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Of all these genes, the A20 gene was rapidly and most significantly induced by TNF-α (Fig. 5 A). TheIEX-1L was moderately induced and the rest of the genes analyzed were not induced at all by TNF-α. The finding that only two out of the five NF-κB-dependent anti-apoptotic genes that we analyzed are TNF-α inducible in 293 cells suggests that in different cell types, resistance to TNF-α induced cell death is conferred by different sets of anti-apoptotic genes. To examine the possible involvement of TAFII105 inA20 transcription, we tested whether the endogenousA20 mRNA level is affected by TAFII105 expression. 293 cells were transiently transfected with wild type or dominant negative mutant TAFII105ΔC and treated with TNF-α for 1 h. RNA was extracted and used to monitor the level of the A20 mRNA by RT-PCR reaction. TAFII105 expression elevates the TNF-α-induced A20 mRNA whreas TAFII105ΔC inhibits it (Fig. 5, B andC). The effect of TAFII105 is specific since it had no significant effect on the level of GAPDH mRNA. In agreement with a previous study (20.Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17971-17976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we found that the transcription of the A20 gene is NF-κB dependent, since expression of superdominant IκB similarly inhibited A20 transcription. Thus, induction A20 mRNA by TNF-α involves NF-κB proteins and the TFIID complex containing TAFII105. The proximal promoter region of the A20 gene contains two NF-κB-binding sites that are crucial for the TNF-α inducibility of this gene (20.Krikos A. Laherty C.D. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17971-17976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further test the involvement of the TAFII105·TFIID complex in A20 transcription we determined the effect of TAFII105 on the promoter activity of the A20 gene. 293 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene under the control of the A20promoter together with p65 subunit of NF-κB and TAFII105. TAFII105 enhances both, basal and p65 induced activity of the A20 promoter (Fig.6 A, columns 3 and7), and this induction requires the presence of NF-κB proteins as TAFII105 fails to induce the A20promoter activity in the presence of the NF-κB inhibitor protein, IκB (columns 5 and 9) or when NF-κB sites were deleted from the promoter (columns 11–14). We also examined the effect of the dominant negative mutant of TAFII105 on the A20 promoter activity. TAFII105ΔC inhibited the basal and p65 induced activity of the A20 promoter (compare columns 1 and4 to 6 and 10). The inhibition of basal and induced A20 promoter activity by TAFII105ΔC is similar to that of IκB (columns 5 and 8). We then tested the effect of TAFII105 on the TNF-α induced activity of the A20 promoter. Here again TAFII105 enhances the TNF-α induced promoter activity (Fig. 6 B, column 3) and TAFII105ΔC abolished this induction (column 6). In the presence of IκB, or when the NF-κB-binding site is deleted, TAFII105 fails to enhance A20 promoter activity (column 5) indicating that enhancement of TNF-α stimulated promoter activity by TAFII105 requires the NF-κB proteins. Similarly, TAFII105 further stimulated the activity of theA20 promoter in the human fibroblast cell line HT1080 (Fig.6 C) indicating that the effect of TAFII105 on the A20 promoter is not restricted to 293 cells. The early TNF-α induced gene A20 is a zinc finger-containing protein involved in modulation of TNF-α signaling (21.Song H.Y. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6721-6725Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar) and inhibition of apoptotic proteases (22.Wissing D. Mouritzen H. Jaattela M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 25: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A20 confers resistance to TNF-α cytotoxicity and to other apoptotic signals in certain cell types (15.Opipari A.W. Hu J.R. Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12424-12427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23.Jaattela M. Mouritzen H. Elling F. Bastholm L. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12343-12346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 25.Fries K.L. Miller W.E. Raab-Traub N. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8653-8659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since promotion of cell death by TAFII105ΔC and IκBα is associated with inhibition of anti-apoptotic genes such asA20, we tested whether overexpression of the A20gene would protect cells from the apoptotic effect of TAFII105ΔC or IκBα. Cells were transfected with expression plasmids of TAFII105ΔC or superdominant IκBα along with the green fluorescent protein plasmid and viability of the transfected cells was measured 48 h after addition of TNF-α. Similar marked reductions in cell survival were observed in cells expressing TAFII105ΔC or superdominant IκBα, in response to TNF-α (Fig. 7 A, columns 4 and6, and B, middle panel). However, when theA20 gene was co-transfected with TAFII105ΔC, the TNF-α-induced apoptosis was overcome and cell survival was significantly increased (Fig. 7 A, compare columns 4 and 8, and B). It was noted that theA20 gene only partially blocked the TNF-α-induced apoptosis in cells expressing superdominant IκBα (comparecolumns 6 to 10). This suggests that full rescue from IκBα-mediated apoptosis requires expression of some other anti-apoptotic genes besides A20. Furthermore, the differential protective effect of A20 indicates that the inhibitory effect of TAFII105ΔC on NF-κB anti-apoptotic genes is more restricted than that of IκBα which is known to be a general inhibitor of NF-κB. Thus, it can be concluded that TAFII105 mediates activation of only a subset of NF-κB-dependent genes in response to TNF-α. This notion is consistent with the selective binding of TAFII105 by just one of the NF-κB complexes induced by TNF-α. In this study we have dissected the molecular mechanism involved in activation of anti-apoptotic genes by TAFII105 and p65/RelA. Using biochemical and functional analyses of TAFII105-NF-κB interaction together with the characterization of a gene regulated by TAFII105 and NF-κB, we show that TAFII105 functions in a selective manner with respect to NF-κB. TAFII105 exhibits high affinity to NF-κB dimers composed of p65/p65 and p65/c-Rel subunits; interaction with heterodimer composed of p65/50, however, is significantly less efficient. Since in the cell the amount of TAFII105-TFIID complex is limited (26.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), it is likely that it will be targeted only by those NF-κB complexes for which it displays high affinity. Genes activated by the p65/p50 complex are, therefore, less likely to be regulated by TAFII105. Identification of A20 as a gene regulated by TAFII105, and examination of its anti-apoptotic activity provided some evidence that the relative affinity of TAFII105 toward different forms of NF-κB dimers contributes to differential gene activation by NF-κB. The results showed that the TNF-α-induced mRNA level of the endogenousA20 gene is enhanced by TAFII105 expression and reduced by both dominant negative mutants of TAFII105 and IκBα. Consistent with the cell death protective function of theA20 gene, its expression in 293 cells shields them against apoptosis induced by the mutant TAFII105 protein and TNF-α, suggesting that down-regulation of A20 by TAFII105ΔC is associated with the cell death response. Since the A20 gene only partially suppresses apoptosis induced by superdominant IκBα and TNF-α, full protection requires additional genes activated by NF-κB as reported elsewhere (17.Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2552) Google Scholar). Importantly, the differential effect of A20 on TAFII105ΔC and IκBα indicates that the inhibitory effect of TAFII105ΔC on NF-κB activity is not as general as is that of IκBα, and is directed to certain specific genes. These results are compatible with the selective association of TAFII105 with one of NF-κB complexes induced by TNF-α in 293 cells. Hence, it is conceivable that NF-κB can utilize alternative pathways for transcription activation. Such alternative pathways might be dependent on the structure and composition of the target gene promoter as well as on the existence of other coactivators for NF-κB proteins. This idea is consistent with recent studies showing that transcription activation by the p65/RelA subunit of NF-κB can be mediated by multiple and distinct coactivators (9.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10.Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J.

Zhou S. Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that different coactivator complexes may act sequentially during the transcription activation process (28.Cosma M.P. Tanaka T. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 97: 299-311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Our results also raise the possibility that different coactivator subunits may function in the context of different target genes, suggesting that activator-coactivator interaction is important for specifying gene activation. The suggested mechanism provides a partial explanation as to how NF-κB containing complex activates different arrays of genes in response to different extracellular signals. The expression pattern of TAFII105 and A20 genes in normal tissues is similar. TAFII105 protein levels are relatively high in certain B cell lines (26.Dikstein R. Zhou S. Tjian R. Cell. 1996; 87: 137-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and in normal murine lymphoid organs such as spleen and thymus (data not shown). Similarly, high levels of the murine A20 mRNA were also found in lymphoid organs, including the thymus and spleen (27.Tewari M. Wolf F.W. Seldin M.F. O'Shea K.S. Dixit V.M. Turka L.A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 1699-1706PubMed Google Scholar). Since NF-κB is constitutively active in many lymphoid cell types, it is possible that large amounts of NF-κB·TAFII105·TFIID complex in lymphoid cells are responsible for the significant expression of theA20 gene in these cells. The role of TAFs in transcription is not entirely understood. In vitro transcription studies have clearly indicated that TAFs are essential activation domains mediators, as well as promoter selectivity factors (29.Verrijzer C.P. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 338-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 30.Hoffmann A. Oelgeschlager T. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8928-8935Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). On the other hand genetic analysis of some yeast TAFs indicated that transcription from many promoters is not affected by their inactivation (31.Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poon D. Weil P.A. Struhl K. Nature. 1996; 383: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 32.Walker S.S. Reese J.C. Apone L.M. Green M. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent studies revealed a mechanism of transcription activation that is TAF-independent (33.Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Nature. 1995; 368: 466-469Crossref Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 34.Oelgeschlager T. Tao Y. Kang Y.K. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and that certain TAFs are subunits of additional multiprotein complexes (35.Grant P.A. Schieltz D. Pray-Grant M.G.

Nature. 1998; 393: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It is therefore apparent that identifying the genes regulated by TFIID subunits and the mechanism by which these TAFs functionin vivo are critical to understanding the role of TAFs. The previous finding that TAFII105 is an activation domain-specific coactivator of p65/RelA required for transcription activation of anti-apoptotic genes (9.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) together with the present characterization of TAFII105 as coactivator of a specific set of NF-κB genes, is an important step toward understanding how TAFs work and what role they play in specific gene regulatory pathways.

Comparison of functional and structural properties of both chimeras show that rChII can accommodate the imposed modifications and displays nearly all the acetylcholinesterase-blocking activities of fasciculins. The three-dimensional structure of rChII demonstrates that rChII adopts a typical three-fingered fold with structural features of both parent toxins.

The abundant literature on the structures of three-fingered toxins indicates that their fold is composed of a globular core with four disulfides and three fingers that emerge from the core. It has been suggested that the primary function of the core is to maintain the overall structure of this family of toxins (11.Brown L.R. Wütrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 1118-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 12.Hatanaka H. Oka M. Kohda D. Tate S. Suda A. Tamiya N. Inagaki F. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas a structural plasticity is perceived at the level of the loops (13.Albrand J.P. Blackledge M.J. Pascaud F. Hollecker M. Marion D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5923-5937Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The latter might allow functional residues in different active toxins to adopt a variety of arrangements to recognize their targets (14.Ménez A. Bontems F. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Toma F. Harvey A.L. The Advancement of Drug Discovery. Royal Society of Edinburg, 1992: 83-103Google Scholar, 15.Ohno M. Ménez R. Ogawa T. Danse J.M. Shimohigashi Y. Fromen C. Ducancel F. Zinn-Justin S. Le Du M.H. Boulain J.C. Tamiya T. Ménez A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 307-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Close inspection of individual three-finger structures reveals that they display marked differences from one toxin to another, indicating that this fold can indeed accommodate some deviations. Thus, the first loop is longer in short-chain than in long-chain curaremimetic toxins, and long-chain toxins possess an extra loop cyclized by a disulfide bond localized at the very tip of the central loop (2.Endo T. Tamiya N. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 165-222Google Scholar). In muscarinic toxins, the tip of the central loop is more twisted than in a short-chain curaremimetic toxins (7.Ségalas I. Roumestand C. Zinn-Justin S. Gilquin B. Ménez R. Ménez A. Toma F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1248-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The orientations of the loops relative to the plane defined by the sheet characteristic of three-fingers toxins can also vary from one toxin to another (15.Ohno M. Ménez R. Ogawa T. Danse J.M. Shimohigashi Y. Fromen C. Ducancel F. Zinn-Justin S. Le Du M.H. Boulain J.C. Tamiya T. Ménez A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 307-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Finally, the fold acts as a monomer in most toxins or as a dimer in neuronal toxins. It is currently speculated that these structural deviations reflect distinct functions, and indeed this hypothesis recently received some support. Thus, it has been demonstrated that the capacity of long-chain curaremimetic toxins to recognize the α7-type neuronal acetylcholine receptor with high affinity, is depending on the presence of an extra cyclic loop at the tip of their central loop (16.Servent D. Winckler-Dietrich V. Hu H.Y. Kessler P. Drevet P. Bertrand D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24279-24286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The aim of this paper was to explore the possibility that other structural deviations, more subtle than the presence of a cluster of additional residues, could also reflect the localization of a particular functional topography. To investigate this hypothesis, we searched for structural deviations between two functionally unrelated three-fingered toxins: a short-chain curaremimetic toxin that blocks acetylcholine receptors (17.Chang C.C. Lee C.Y. Snake Venoms, Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology. 52. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1979: 309-376Google Scholar), and a fasciculin known as acetylcholinesterase blocker (18.Rodriguez-Ithuralde D. Silveira R. Barbeito L. Dajas F. Neurochem. Int. 1983; 5: 267-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The biological determinants of these two toxins were recently shown to be located within the same area of the three finger fold but on opposite faces (15.Ohno M. Ménez R. Ogawa T. Danse J.M. Shimohigashi Y. Fromen C. Ducancel F. Zinn-Justin S. Le Du M.H. Boulain J.C. Tamiya T. Ménez A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1998; 59: 307-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). An exhaustive mutational analysis revealed that a short-chain neurotoxin recognizes the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor via a homogenous and polar surface of 10 residues located on one face of the toxin (19.Pillet L. Trémeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P. Zinn-Justin S. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Trémeau O. Lemaire C.

In contrast, the three-dimensional structures of two fasciculin 2 AChE1 complexes revealed a three point anchorage forming a large contact area located on the other face of the toxin and involving a majority of main-chain/side-chain hydrophobic interactions (21.Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 22.Harel M. Kleywegt G.J. Ravelli R.B.G. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We investigated the possibility of generating acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activity within the host curare-like toxin α through the progressive transfer of the most structural deviating regions from fasciculin 2. We show that the host protein cannot only accommodate the imposed structural modifications but also that the biological activity of the host short-chain toxin vanished, whereas nearly all the acetylcholinesterase-blocking activities of fasciculins emerged in a chimeric protein. The three-dimensional structure of the most active chimeric compound we engineered reveals a typical three-finger fold among which only transferred regions adopt a fasciculin-like conformation. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that structural deviations and functional topographies are intimately linked to each other. They also emphasize the great structural flexibility and functional adaptability of the three-finger fold. We propose this approach as a convenient alternative to systematic mutations in predicting a functional determinant at the surface of a toxin adopting a three-fingered scaffold. The evolutionary implications of these findings will be discussed. DNA fragments encoding recombinant fasciculin 1 (rFas1) and chimeric Tα/Fas proteins, named rChI and -II, were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pCP (23.Drevet P. Lemaire C. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Lajeunesse E. Ducancel F. Pinkasfeld S. Courçon M. Trémeau O. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and expressed as fusion proteins with two synthetic IgG binding domains derived from protein A (24.Nilsson B. Moks T. Jansson B. Abrahmsen L. Elmbllad A. Holmgren E. Henrichson C. Jones T.A. Uhlen M. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Extremities of the cDNA encoding fasciculin 1 were conveniently modified by polymerase chain reaction amplification to allow its orientated cloning. The synthetic genes encoding the two chimera were derived from that initially built to express the native toxin α from Naja nigricollis (23.Drevet P. Lemaire C. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Lajeunesse E. Ducancel F. Pinkasfeld S. Courçon M. Trémeau O. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using the primary structures of native toxin α and fasciculin 2 (Fig.1 A). Briefly, the strategy for assembling the genes was as follows: first, 100 pmol of 12 complementary oligonucleotides with sizes ranging from 17 to 48 bases, covering both strands and using high frequency codons in Escherichia coli, were annealed together; second, semisynthetic genes were generated after ligation together of the three N and C terminus cassettes, respectively, and third, semisynthetic genes were gel-purified and covalently associated. The cDNA and the two synthetic genes have at their 5′-extremities a KpnI restriction site followed by a sequence encoding residues Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys specifically recognized by the bovine enterokinase. Two tandem stop codons TAA and aBamHI restriction site were created de novo at the 3′-extremities (Fig. 1 B). Finally, correctness of these constructions was checked by DNA sequencing of both strands. E. coli BL21(DE3)LysS was used as a host strain for the expression of ZZ-Fas1 and ZZ-Tα/Fas I and II. For this purpose, an overnight culture of freshly transformed cells was used to inoculate 500 ml of tryptic soy broth (Difco, Detroit, MI) supplemented with glucose (5 g/liter), ampicillin (200 mg/l), and chloramphenicol (30 mg/l). Induction of hybrids production was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mm (final concentration) isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside when the optical density of the culture incubated at 37 °C under aeration reached 0.5–0.6 at 600 nm. After 3 h of induction (A 600 = 1.8–2.0), cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 ml of TSE buffer (30 mmTris-HCl, 20% sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8) supplemented with 0.1 mm of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (final concentration), and disrupted by sonication at 0 °C, 5 × 3 min at 60% of full power. The supernatant was first purified on an IgG-Sepharose 4B-column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to Drevet et al. (23.Drevet P. Lemaire C. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Lajeunesse E. Ducancel F. Pinkasfeld S. Courçon M. Trémeau O. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lyophilized hybrids eluted from the IgG column were further purified by chromatography on a reverse-phase HPLC column (Vydac, C4 semipreparative) equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Elution was performed using a 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/CH3CN/H2O gradient of 0–60% in 60 min. Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically, based on the following calculated extinction coefficients at 278 nm: εM = 6200, 7500, and 8800 cm−1 for ZZ-ChI, -ChII, and -Fas1, respectively. 1 mg of ZZ fusion protein purified as described above was combined with bovine enteropeptidase (Invitrogen, EKMax grade, specific activity = 8.500 units/ml) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 10 mm CaCl2, 1% Tween-20, in a total volume of 0.83 ml, at an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:19,000 (w/w) and incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Resulting rFas1 or Tα/Fas chimeras were directly chromatographed on a reverse-phase column (Vydac, C18) using the following gradient: 0–5 min in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 5–30 min to reach 24% of CH3CN, 10 min in trifluoroacetic acid, 0.1%/CH3CN 24%, and finally 40–70 min to obtain 60% of CH3CN. Products were analyzed on 20% polyacrylamide gel and submitted to amino acid composition and Edman degradation for peptide sequencing. In vitro renaturation of unfolded proteins was performed overnight at room temperature in a final volume of 1 ml using the following buffer: 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 8, containing 4 mm GSH and 2 mm GSSG. Refolded compounds were finally purified using conditions similar to those previously described. The dichroic spectra of refolded compounds were recorded at 20 °C using a CD VI Jobin-Yvon dicrograph, at a protein concentration of 5 × 10−5m. The radioimmunoassays were carried out as described previously using3H-labeled toxin α and two toxin-specific monoclonal antibodies, i.e. Mα1 and Mα2–3(25.Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Couderc J. Faure G. Liacopoulos P. Fromageot P. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Electrophorus electricus electroplax acetylcholinesterase (EeAChE) and human butyrylcholinesterase were used to assess the inhibitory activities of rFas1, rChI, and rChII. AChE activities were spectrophotometrically measured using acetylthiocholine (1.0–0.06 mm) as substrate and 0.3 mm5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) as chromophore in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA (26.Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21721) Google Scholar). Assay mixtures (including the different inhibitors) were preincubated for 60 min at 37 °C before starting the reaction by the addition of acetylthiocholine.K ivalues of rChII and native fasciculin 2 were estimated from Dixon plots as previously reported (27.Dixon M. Biochem J. 1972; 129: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 28.Karlsson E. Mbugua P.M. Rodriguez-Ithurralde D. J. Physiol. (Paris). 1984; 79: 232-240PubMed Google Scholar, 29.Duran R. Cervenansky C. Dajas F. Tipton K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1201: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The lowerK i value of rChI was estimated from slopes and intercepts of reciprocal 1/v Lineweaver-Burk plots versusvarious chimera I concentrations. Human BChE activities were assayed in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml BSA at 37 °C with butyrylthiocholine (BTCh) as substrate, after a preincubation of 10 min. Hydrolysis of 1 mm BTCh was followed spectrophotometrically. Type and inhibition constants of BuChE for recombinant chimera II were determined either using Dixon plots 1/vversus inhibitor concentration or according to Cornish-Bowden (30.Cornish-Bowden A. Biochem J. 1974; 137: 143-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar) by plotting S/v against S, at three BTCh concentrations: 0.13, 0.25, and 0.50 mm. To examine the structural homogeneity of these two toxin families, we compared the x-ray three-dimensional structures of representative members using the iterative program ALIGN (31.Satow Y. Cohen G.H. Padlan E.A. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Curaremimetic toxins clearly form a homogenous structural family, with a calculated average r.m.s. cα deviation value of 1.2 Å. However, the tips of loop 1 (residues 7–12), of loop 2 (residues 29–35), and the two C-terminal residues deviate by between 3 and 5 Å (not shown). It is noteworthy, that six of the ten functional residues forming the toxic site of this famility of toxins are located in the two most variable regions (19.Pillet L. Trémeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P. Zinn-Justin S. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Trémeau O. Lemaire C. Drevet P. Pinkasfeld S. Ducancel F. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9362-9369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the flexibility of the tip of loops 1 and 2 is necessary to fit the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (32.Guenneugues M. Drevet P. Pinkasfeld S. Gilquin B. Ménez A. Zinn-Justin S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16097-16108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Fasciculin 1 and 2 from the venom of the green mamba Dendroaspis angusticeps are two potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterases (8.Cervenansky C. Dajas F. Harvey A.L. Karlsson E. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 303-321Google Scholar) whose high resolution three-dimensional structures have been solved using x-ray crystallography (9.Le Du M.H. Marchot P. Bougis P.E. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22122-22130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Le Du M.H. Housset D. Marchot P. Bougis P.E. Navaza J. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1996; 52: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Their amino acid sequences differ only by a single substitution at position 47, where a tyrosine or an asparagine is found in fasciculin 1 and 2, respectively (33.Ducancel F. Bouchier C. Tamiya T. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 385-414Google Scholar). Superimposition of their backbones reveals r.m.s. cα deviation values mostly comprised between 0.3 and 2 Å. Only residues 6–13 of loop 1 have distinct conformations with r.m.s. deviations ranging between 2 and 10 Å (not shown). It has been proposed that this unusual loop flexibility might be important in the binding to AChEs. Interestingly, elucidation of the x-ray structures of two fasciculin 2 AChE complexes shows that the conformation of the free fasciculin 2 resembles that of the bound state and differs from that of free fasciculin 1 (21.Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 22.Harel M. Kleywegt G.J. Ravelli R.B.G. Silman I. Sussman J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data support the idea that loop 1 in fasciculins displays considerable mobility, which is important for tight binding to AChEs. The identification of interacting residues at the tip of loop 1 further emphasizes its functional importance. Even if characterized by a similar fold, curaremimetic toxins and fasciculins therefore possess a number of specific structural features. To identify precisely the regions where these structural deviations occur, we carried out a detailed structural comparison of toxin α from Naja nigricollis, a typical member of short-chain toxins (34.Eaker D. Porath J. J. Microbiol. (Japan). 1967; 11: 353-355Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35.Zinn-Justin S. Roumestand C. Gilquin B. Bontems F. Ménez A. Toma F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11335-11347Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and fasciculin 2. Though both toxins possess 61 residues, toxin α and fasciculin 2 each differ by a specific insertion, which causes a numbering shift from position 18 that is only restored at position 56 (see Fig.1). Using the iterative program ALIGN, we performed a superimposition of the backbone of the x-ray structure of fasciculin 2 and toxin α (Fig. 2,lower views), revealing an average r.m.s. deviation of 2.82 Å for 226 of the 244 atom pairs of the backbone used. The best superimpositions include most of the major β-sheet strands: 3–5, 14–17, 23–26, 34–41, and 49–55, together with the turn linking loops 2 and 3, and the upper part of loop 3, which includes residues 56–60. However, distances greater than 2.0 Å were observed for regions 5–12, 18–21, 27–34, 41–47, 50, 55–56, and 61 (Fas numbering). Therefore, the regions with the largest structural deviations between toxin α and fasciculin 2 correspond to almost all of the first loop, the following turn, the lower part of the second loop, and the C terminus residue. Interestingly, except for segment 18–21, the functional residues of these two molecules are included in these areas. That segment 18–21 did not superimpose well is not surprising because it corresponds to the turn connecting loops 1 and 2, where the additional proline +18 in toxin α is located. The deviating region 5–12 forms a β-hairpin at the tip of loop 1 of both toxins. However, their primary structures are totally different resulting in highly distinct organizations in the two toxins, the hairpin looks longer in toxin α and broader in fasciculin 2 (Fig. 2). Amino acid residues 27–34 constitute the largest deviating region with a maximum distance of 12 Å for cα31. This second β-hairpin localized at the extremity of the central loop displays opposite orientations in the two toxins, inducing an inversion of their overall concavity (Fig. 2). Thus, the fine comparison of the structures adopted by fasciculin 2 versus toxin α reveals three significant structural deviating regions corresponding to the tips of loops 1 and 2 together with residue 61. A first chimera (ChI) was designed by transferring in toxin α the two major deviating regions 5–12 and 27–34 from fasciculin 2 (Fig. 1). As deduced from the above comparison plus the sequence alignment, these two sequences belong to the first and second loops. Moreover, it is known that the adjacent residues of an amino acid sequence region are often critical for this stretch to adopt the expected secondary structure (36.Minor Jr., D.L. Kim P.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 730-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In addition, the structure superimposition revealed conserved residues surrounding the deviating regions (Fig. 1), possibly playing the role of hinges to naturally accommodate the transferred segments into the host toxin. Therefore, to preserve both the β-sheet and the loop flexibility, we transferred the loop 1 in its entirety, together with residues 27–37 (toxin α numbering) in the first construction (Fig. 1). To further attenuate the structural deviations between the two toxin conformations, we designed a second chimeric construction (Fig. 1). In the latter, we additionally substituted the C-terminal asparagine residue of toxin α for a tyrosine. This was motivated by the observation that within the complex formed with AChE, the C terminus of Fas2 is stabilized by Tyr-4, inducing a substantial increase of the interface (21.Bourne Y. Taylor P. Marchot P. Cell. 1995; 83: 503-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). By doing this, we anticipated that all residues involved in the stabilizing intramolecular hydrogen bonding between both loops 1 and 2 and the C terminus of native fasciculin 2 may be correctly transferred. We therefore designed two recombinant chimeric proteins, rChI and rChII, by substituting into toxin α 41 and 42, 6% of fasciculin 2 residues, respectively. Among the 45 remaining amino acid residues of rChII, 13, the four pairs of cysteine residues, Tyr-23, Arg-37, Gly-38, Pro-42, and Asn-59, have been described as forming the core responsible for the common three-fingered architecture (13.Albrand J.P. Blackledge M.J. Pascaud F. Hollecker M. Marion D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5923-5937Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), 15 are specific to short-chain curaremimetic toxins, and 21 are common to both toxin families. Three reasons motivated our choice to express fasciculin 1 instead of 2 as reference for this study. First, prior to this work we cloned the cDNA encoding fasciculin 1 (33.Ducancel F. Bouchier C. Tamiya T. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 385-414Google Scholar); second, both AChE inhibitors display very similar biological activity (8.Cervenansky C. Dajas F. Harvey A.L. Karlsson E. Harvey A.L. Snake Toxins. Pergamon Press, New York1991: 303-321Google Scholar); and third, the single difference between fasciculin 1 and 2 is located at position +47, a region of short-chain origin within the two chimera we designed. Recombinant native fasciculin 1 and chimera I and II were produced within the bacterial cytoplasm fused to two synthetic IgG binding domains (24.Nilsson B. Moks T. Jansson B. Abrahmsen L. Elmbllad A. Holmgren E. Henrichson C. Jones T.A. Uhlen M. Protein Eng. 1987; 1: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). This recombinant system was previously proved to be highly efficient for producing small proteins rich in disulfide bonds (23.Drevet P. Lemaire C. Gasparini S. Zinn-Justin S. Lajeunesse E. Ducancel F. Pinkasfeld S. Courçon M. Trémeau O. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and recently to generate recombinant toxoids (37.Lobeck K. Drevet P. Léonetti M. Fromen-Romano C. Ducancel F. Lajeunesse E. Lemaire C. Ménez A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 418-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It offers the double advantage of maintaining hybrids in a soluble form and rendering their purification from bacteria lysates easy by IgG affinity chromatography. Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3, shows an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of an IgG-Sepharose eluted fraction of a lysate obtained from bacteria transformed with plasmids encoding the fused chimera I or II, revealing identical profiles. Each IgG-purified recombinant ZZ-chimera appears as a major band, migrating with an apparent molecular mass close to the expected 24 kDa. A similar value was noted for the ZZ-Fas1 hybrid (not shown). Furthermore, the ZZ-Fas1 or ZZ-chimera hybrids were stable in the bacterial cytoplasm because no low molecular weight product was detected on the gel (Fig.3). After an additional purification step on reverse-phase HPLC chromatography, 70–90 mg of ZZ-fusion toxins were obtained/liter of bacterial culture, which is about 100 times higher than yields achieved using the secretion vector pEZZ18 (19.Pillet L. Trémeau O. Ducancel F. Drevet P. Zinn-Justin S. Pinkasfeld S. Boulain J.C. Ménez A. J. Biol. C"

https://openalex.org/W1534501781,"The star η Carinae, the most luminous known in the Milky Way galaxy, is a puzzling object. It is surrounded by a cloud of glowing gas that shows a distinct ‘pinched waist’ appearance, whose origin has been controversial. Morris et al.1 proposed that a massive but very compact torus of gas encircles the star, and that this caused the bipolar shape by preventing gas ejected by the star from expanding in the equatorial plane. Here we show that the small size of the torus (diameter of 5 arcsec) is insufficient to produce the observed infrared flux that inspired the conjecture. The dust giving rise to the 17-μm emission must be distributed over an area at least ten times the size of the torus.
