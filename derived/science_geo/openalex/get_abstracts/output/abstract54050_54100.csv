https://openalex.org/W1510025470,"Gluconeogenesis from amino acids was investigated with isolated rat livers perfused with Krebs bicarbonate buffer containing bovine red cells and serum albumin. In livers from fasted rats perfused with a mixture of amino acids at various multiples of their normal plasma concentrations, glucose production was half-maximal at normal amino acid concentrations and approached saturation at three times normal concentrations. Urea production also rose with increasing concentrations of amino acids, but was not saturated at four times normal levels. It is concluded that the rate of release of amino acids from peripheral tissues can be important in controlling hepatic gluconeogenesis. In livers perfused with physiological levels of amino acids, glucagon increased alanine conversion to glucose 3.5-fold and produced changes in the steady state concentrations of intermediates of the gluconeogenic pathway which indicated stimulation of the conversion of pyruvate to phosphopyruvate. With high concentrations of alanine, transamination became a significant rate-limiting step for gluconeogenesis. Under these conditions glucagon or cyclic 3',5'-AMP increased alanine conversion to glucose 2- to 3-fold, and the changes in intermediates indicated that they also stimulated the transport of alanine into the cell. Maximum gluconeogenesis from alanine was reached only when the perfusate concentration of alanine was 20 times the normal, physiological level. Glucagon stimulated both glucose and urea production from the amino acid mixture at all amino acid concentrations studied. Urea production was also stimulated by epinephrine and cyclic 3',5'-AMP in livers perfused with or without amino acids. It is proposed that glucagon and possibly catecholamines play a role in the physiological regulation of gluconeogenesis from amino acids by increasing the formation of cyclic 3',5'AMP, which acts to stimulate both the transport of amino acids into the hepatic cell and the conversion of pyruvate to P-pyruvate."

https://openalex.org/W1532885370,"Abstract The effects on the isolated perfused rat liver of glucagon, dibutyryl 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate (dibutyryl cyclic AMP), and oleic acid were studied with particular reference to actions on hepatic metabolism of lipids. The rate of uptake of oleic acid by livers from normal fed animals was proportional to the concentration of free fatty acid in the medium and generally was not altered significantly by addition of glucagon to the medium. Glucagon stimulated the rate of ketogenesis and inhibited the output of triglyceride by the liver. The output of ketone bodies by the liver, which was a function of the concentration of oleic acid in the medium, was stimulated by glucagon at concentrations of free fatty acids less than 1.0 to 1.5 mm; at higher concentrations, rates of ketogenesis were similar whether or not glucagon was added to the perfusate. The output of triglyceride, which was dependent on the concentration of oleic acid in the perfusate, was depressed by glucagon at all concentrations of free fatty acids. The net accumulation of triglyceride in the liver was a function of the concentration of fatty acid in the medium and did not appear to be affected significantly by glucagon. The uptake of oleic acid from the medium was not affected by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, but the nucleotide stimulated production of ketone bodies and inhibited output of triglyceride. The output of glucose and urea by liver was stimulated by glucagon. The output of glucose also was increased by dibutyryl cyclic AMP; in these experiments, even though the mean output of urea when cyclic AMP was added exceeded the control, the differences were not statistically significant. It is postulated that hepatic rates of oxidation and ketogenesis from free fatty acids perfusing the liver are increased by glucagon and by cyclic AMP. Glucagon and cyclic AMP may exert their actions in part by direct stimulation of oxidative pathways and in part by inhibition of biosynthetic pathways as the formation and release of triglyceride and the very low density lipoprotein."
https://openalex.org/W1607928467,"Abstract A phosphatase which releases orthophosphate from histones and protamine has been purified 60-fold from rat liver. Histone phosphatase was detected by the use of substrates enzymatically phosphorylated by histone kinase. Purified histone phosphatase preparations are inactive in the dephosphorylation of other phosphoproteins, low molecular weight phosphate esters, and phosphopeptides derived from active substrates. The apparent Km for dephosphorylation of histone f1 is 2 x 10-5 m. The reaction products are orthophosphate and intact histone or protamine, as indicated by electrophoretic studies. Optimal reaction rates were observed at pH 7 to 8 and ionic strength 0.1 to 0.2. Chromatography on diethylaminoethyl cellulose resolved histone phosphatase activity into two fractions which exhibited a 2-fold difference in relative rates of dephosphorylation of histone fl and protamine. Histone phosphatase activity was detected in all eukaryotic cells examined, but it was absent in extracts of several prokaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W1852519544,"Rat liver plasma membranes were isolated by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation. The purity of membrane preparations was checked by electron microscopy and enzyme assays. A new glycolipid, tentatively called the S-lipid, is proposed as a marker to indicate the purity of plasma membranes. It is present in most subcellular particulates (mitochondria, microsomes, lysosomes, etc.) but is absent from plasma membranes. The plasma membrane lipids represent 39.8% of the total dry weight of the membranes. Plasma membrane total lipid contains 39% neutral lipids of which free cholesterol (18.1%) and free fatty acids (7.9%) are the major components. These are present in somewhat lower amounts (4.0 and 1.3%, respectively) in lipid extracts from whole liver homogenate. The phospholipids constitute 55.4% of membrane total lipids. The phospholipid fraction is composed mainly of phosphatidylcholine (19.3% of the total lipids), phosphatidylethanolamine (10.3%), and sphingomyelin (9.8%). The minor constituents are phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidic acid, and lysophosphatidylcholine. The phospholipids of the plasma membranes, compared with those of the entire liver, have considerably higher amounts of sphingomyelin and phosphatidylserine (both about 3-fold). In the membranes, about 5.6% of the total lipids are glycolipids and lipids that are unaccounted for. Compared with the liver, the membranes, according to gas-liquid chromatographic analyses of the total lipid fatty acids and hydrocarbons, show a tendency to accumulate the longer chain fatty acids and hydrocarbons. The membranes also contain relatively higher amounts of saturated fatty acids and much less branched chain hydrocarbons."
https://openalex.org/W1791803985,"The effects of glucagon on the output of amino acids by the isolated rat liver perfused with recirculating medium were to decrease that of glycine, glutamate, and phenylalanine; to increase greatly that of leucine, isoleucine, valine, and tyrosine; and to increase slightly that of lysine and histidine. In livers perfused with nonrecirculating medium containing amino acids at concentrations found in plasma from normal rats, glucagon produced changes in intracellular and extracellular concentrations which suggested a stimulation of (a) intracellular utilization of glycine, alanine, glutamate, and phenylalanine; (b) intracellular production of leucine, isoleucine, and valine; and (c) inward transport of lysine and, in other experiments, the nonmetabolizable amino acids, α-aminoisobutyrate and 1-aminocyclopentane carboxylic acid. The changes in amino acid concentrations caused by glucagon resembled those found in diabetic animals."

https://openalex.org/W1552655208,"Abstract Succinate dehydrogenase has been isolated in a highly purified form from succinate-coenzyme Q reductase preparations. The enzyme contains 1 mole of covalently bound flavin, 8 g atoms of iron, and 8 moles of acid-labile sulfide per 150,000 g of protein. It catalyzes succinate oxidation in the presence of phenazine methosulfate as electron acceptor at a rate of 26 to 32 µmoles per min x mg of protein (Vpmsmax ≃ 37). The succinate dehydrogenase thus prepared does not couple to the electron transport system, but it can be made to do so after treatment with Na2S, ferrous ions, and mercaptoethanol. Thus, both the succinate-coenzyme Q reductase and the succinoxidase systems have been reconstituted by combining the reactivated succinate dehydrogenase with appropriate segments of the respiratory chain. These results permit a better understanding of the composition and the electron transfer pathway of the mitochondrial respiratory chain from succinate to coenzyme Q."
https://openalex.org/W1565208369,"Abstract The binding of aminoacyl transfer RNA to ribosomes is a multistep reaction that is dependent on GTP and on the supernatant fraction called T. An intermediate T-GTP-aminoacyl-tRNA complex can be isolated with the GTP intact. In the work described here, the isolated complex was allowed to interact with ribosomes previously charged with polyuridylic acid and N-acetylphenylalanyl-tRNA; the phenylalanyl-tRNA moiety of the complex bound to the ribosomes, and the GTP was split into GDP and Pi. The same reaction was observed as a GTPase stimulated by T factor, aminoacyl-tRNA, message, and ribosome. This GTPase was not inhibited by sparsomycin, which blocks dipeptide formation, nor by fusidic acid, which blocks the ribosome-dependent GTPase of G factor (the supernatant factor required in addition to the T factor in the polypeptide chain elongation process). The GTPase was not affected by chlortetracycline under conditions in which the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to the ribosomes was blocked. The 50 S ribosomal subunit alone supported the GTP hydrolysis. Both binding and GTPase paralleled each other under limiting GTP concentrations, were poorly inhibited by GDP and guanylyl 5'-methylene diphosphonate, and paralleled each other in NH4+ and Mg++ requirements and sensitivity to a sulfhydryl inhibitor. It is concluded that, although GTP hydrolysis resulted from the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to ribosomes in a 1:1 stoichiometry, the two reactions were not tightly coupled under all experimental conditions. An improved procedure for the purification of the T and G factors is described."

https://openalex.org/W1599185100,"Abstract In perfused livers from fasted rats, glucagon (2 x 10-9 m) caused a 75% increase of glucose formation from lactate, a 3-fold increase of urea production, and a 50% increase of ketogenesis. However, urea formation could account for only about 10% of the glucose formation. Subsequent addition of oleate caused a further 50% stimulation of gluconeogenesis and a 6-fold rise of ketone body formation. The effects of glucagon and oleate on gluconeogenesis were not additive, since glucagon addition in the presence of oleate had no further effect. The stimulation of gluconeogenesis and ketogenesis produced by oleate was almost completely abolished by (+)decanoylcarnitine, an inhibitor of palmitylcarnitine transferase. The effects of glucagon, however, were only partially inhibited by (+)decanoylcarnitine. Glucagon, either in the absence or presence of oleate, increased the ratios of lactate to pyruvate and β-hydroxybutyrate to acetoacetate in the perfusion fluid and in the liver, indicating a more reduced state of the NAD systems in both mitochondrial and cytosolic spaces. Direct measurements of oxidation-reduction changes by surface fluorometry showed that glucagon caused rapid reduction of flavin and pyridine nucleotides. These changes were diminished by prior addition of (+)decanoylcarnitine. Changes in the tissue contents of intermediates showed two control sites after glucagon addition, one between pyruvate and oxalacetate, and the other between fructose-1, 6-di-P and fructose-6-P. Similar changes were observed when oleate was added at the same time as glucagon. In previous publications it has been shown that interactions at these sites produced by oleate were consistent with observed increases in the tissue contents of acetyl coenzyme A and citrate, which presumably caused an activation of pyruvate carboxylase and an inhibition of phosphofructokinase, respectively. However, in the present experiments, neither acetyl-CoA nor citrate contents were significantly increased by glucagon. These results are interpreted as indicating that either other modulators, not measured in the present experiments, affect the activity of these enzymes, or that the concentrations of acetyl-CoA and citrate increased specifically in the mitochondrial and cytosolic compartments, respectively, without appreciably affecting the total tissue contents. The data are discussed in relation to the hypothesis that the gluconeogenic effect of glucagon is mediated by activation of a cyclic 3',5'-AMP-sensitive lipase in the liver which gradually releases fatty acids of different chain lengths. It is proposed that these fatty acids are oxidized partially by carnitine-dependent and partially by carnitine-independent pathways. The results are compatible with the suggestion that the stimulation of gluconeogenesis is secondary to effects produced by enhanced fatty acid oxidation."

https://openalex.org/W1531277794,"Abstract Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) increased within 1 min the adenyl cyclase activity of bovine and canine thyroid homogenate. A similar effect was also found when adenyl cyclase activity was measured in thyroid slices. In experiments in vivo, adenyl cyclase activity was augmented within 3 min after TSH injection, but this effect did not persist for 60 min after the injection. Despite the transient stimulation of adenyl cyclase activity, increased 14C-1-glucose oxidation was still present 60 min after TSH injection. Stimulation in vitro of adenyl cyclase activity in thyroid homogenate was obtained using as little as 1 milliunit of TSH while adrenocorticotropic hormone and prolactin were without effect. TSH did not increase adenyl cyclase activity in adrenal or testis homogenates. TSH stimulation could still be obtained in the presence of 10-2 m NaF. TSH did not modify thyroid phosphodiesterase activity under conditions in which it stimulated adenyl cyclase activity. TSH rapidly increased cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) concentration in canine thyroid slices while luteinizing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, and prolactin were ineffective. Although NaF stimulated adenyl cyclase activity and 14C-1-glucose oxidation in canine thyroid slices, it did not increase cyclic AMP concentrations. During 15-min incubations, 10-2 m theophylline had very little effect on cyclic AMP levels, but significantly increased them during 2-hour incubations. At both times, the effect of TSH on cyclic AMP was markedly potentiated by theophylline. Prostaglandin E2 reproduced effects of TSH on both 14C-1-glucose oxidation and cyclic AMP concentration in canine thyroid slices. Prostaglandin F1α stimulated 14C-1-glucose oxidation, but did not increase cyclic AMP levels. Prostaglandin B1 did not modify either cyclic AMP concentrations or 14C-1-glucose oxidation."

An examination of the properties of these enzymes has shown that their characteristic features are similar to the analogous enzymes isolated from mammalian mitochondria. The purified cytochrome oxidase and the rutamycin-sensitive ATPase are isolated with a low content of phospholipid, and their activity has been found to be stimulated by added phospholipid. The ATPase system of yeast is composed of F1 and a lipoprotein fraction which binds F1 and is necessary for conferral of rutamycin sensitivity."

Electron microscopy revealed axosomatic synapses with close appositions of pre- and postynaptic membranes. Similar junctions are associated with electrotonic coupling in many other cases. Stimulation of the ipsilateral eighth nerve usually initiated impulses at sites distant from the cell bodies; stimulation of the ipsilateral ophthalmic nerve initiated impulses close to the cell bodies. Electrotonic coupling may synchronize impulses arising near the, cell bodies to generate synchronous muscle contractions.

Unlike norepinephrine, dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate does not enhance the accumulation of labeled tryptophan or protein within the pineal. These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that cyclic adenosine monophosphate mediates some, but not all, of the effects of norepinephrine."
https://openalex.org/W1512474832,"Abstract An aldehyde dehydrogenase capable of acting on l-lactaldehyde was detected in a strain of Escherichia coli K-12 selected to grow on 1,2-propanediol as the sole source of carbon and energy. This enzyme activity was purified over 200-fold by ammonium sulfate fractionation followed by diethylaminoethyl cellulose chromatography, Sephadex G-100 gel filtration, and DEAE-Sephadex chromatography. The purified enzyme appears different from the other known aldehyde dehydrogenases in that it specifically converts l-lactaldehyde to lactic acid. This enzyme uses NAD as coenzyme, has a high Km for l-lactaldehyde, and displays a broad pH optimum in the alkaline region. It is produced constitutively by the above bacterial mutant and is essential for the catabolism of 1,2-propanediol."

https://openalex.org/W1893813561,"Abstract The synthesis of total cellular proteins and amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) has been studied in rat parotid gland slices in relation to secretory kinetics. In unstimulated slices, incorporation of radioactive amino acids is maintained at a constant rate for at least 3 hours. In response to epinephrine (30 µm), there is a 50% increase in incorporation into trichloracetic acid-insoluble proteins and a greater than 2-fold rise of incorporation into amylase after 1 hour of incubation. Concurrently there is active secretion of amylase into the medium. If, during the subsequent decline in protein synthesis, epinephrine is again added, the incorporation again doubles but there is no change in the secretory pattern. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP (2 mm) stimulates incorporation to the same extent as epinephrine. Cycloheximide, which suppresses protein synthesis to less than 10% of the control rate, does not stimulate secretion, nor does it inhibit the epinephrine-stimulated secretory response. It is concluded that epinephrine and dibutyryl cyclic AMP stimulate protein synthesis directly and independently of their effect on secretory activity."

https://openalex.org/W1564330022,Abstract d-Glucose-6-P-do and d-glucose-6-P-d7 have been separately and simultaneously incubated with a phosphohexoisomerase-free preparation of d-glucose-6-P-myo-inositol-1-P cyclase from bovine testis. The l-myo-inositol-1-P-d0 and l-myo-inositol-1-P-d6 produced by the reaction were completely trimethylsilylated and analyzed by combined gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The absence of any crossover of label from deuterated to nondeuterated product in the case of the simultaneous incubation is given as evidence that all of the intermediate products in this DPN+-mediated cyclization are enzyme-bound during the course of the reaction. Direct evidence is given for the first time that the phosphate-bearing carbon atom in d-glucose-6-P is the same atom which bears the phosphate in l-myo-inositol-1-P.

https://openalex.org/W1721265097,"The specificity of an extracellular nuclease from Serratia marcescens was examined with both RNA and DNA as substrates. The enzyme was found to act in a predominantly endonucleolytic manner with less than 2% of the degradation products being mononucleotides. Both DNA and RNA were degraded to di-, tri-, and tetranucleotides terminating in 5'-phosphoryl ends. The enzyme had the unusual property of hydrolyzing both single-stranded and doublestranded DNA and RNA at similar rates. No base preference was exhibited at either the 5' or 3' end of the oligonucleotide fragments. When the S. marcescens nuclease was used in conjunction with venom phosphodiesterase, RNA and DNA were rapidly degraded to 5'-mononucleotides. The enzyme is thus potentially useful as a reagent for the study of polynucleotide structure and sequence."

https://openalex.org/W1543514346,"Abstract Changes in transfer RNA and in specific enzymes for transfer RNA methylation were measured during development of the mouse mammary gland. The cell differentiation which occurs in mammary gland during pregnancy is characterized by a disproportionate increase in transfer RNA in relation to total RNA. This disproportionate increase in transfer RNA also occurs during mammary epithelial cell differentiation in vitro, and depends upon the addition of insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin to the synthetic medium. Enzymes which methylate specific bases in exogenous transfer RNA are induced in mammary epithelial cells by insulin and by prolactin. Synchronous increases in transfer RNA and transfer RNA-methylating enzymes were observed throughout development of the mammary gland. Increased transfer RNA-methylating enzyme activity in response to hormones in vitro, or during development in vivo, generally appears to reflect an increased rate of transfer RNA assembly"
https://openalex.org/W1566128308,"Abstract The regulation of N-acetyl-l-glutamate-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase (CP-synthetase) in vitro was studied using a suspension of surviving liver cubes prepared from Rana catesbeiana tadpoles and frogs. An enhancement of CP-synthetase activity was seen in preparations from premetamorphic tadpoles after incubation in vitro with l-thyroxine (2.6 x 10-8 or 2.6 x 10-9 m). Other additives, including a number of hormones, cyclic 3',5'-AMP, tadpole serum, and frog serum had no effect in vitro. Thyroxine added in vitro stimulated the rate of CP-synthetase synthesis in liver preparations from the premetamorphic and metamorphosing tadpoles and the frog. CP-synthetase synthesis in liver cubes was enhanced relative to soluble mitochondrial protein synthesis at thyroxine concentrations of 2.6 x 10-8 m and 2.6 x 10-9 m, and in liver cubes from both tadpoles previously treated with thiouracil and from tadpoles previously treated by immersion in thyroxine 2.6 x 10-7 m. Actinomycin D and puromycin added in vitro at zero time inhibited synthesis of CP-synthetase de novo. When liver cubes from tadpoles pulsed with leucine-3H in vivo were incubated in cold leucine in vitro, an increase in labeled immunoprecipitable CP-synthetase was observed in the presence of actinomycin or puromycin, suggesting an effect on the conversion of nonimmunoprecipitable precursors to labeled immunoprecipitable enzyme. The mechanism underlying the observed increase in conversion of precursors was shown to be caused by an inhibition of CP-synthetase turnover by puromycin and actinomycin. Thyroxine added in vitro resulted in an increase in precursor conversion. The small contribution of synthesis in vitro to the total CP-synthetase pool de novo suggested that enhancement of CP-synthetase levels in vitro was related largely to conversion of precursors to immunoprecipitable enzyme. This concept is consistent with the observation of an increase in total enzyme levels when liver cubes were incubated in the presence of actinomycin or puromycin. The regulation of CP-synthetase levels in liver preparations from the premetamorphic and metamorphosing tadpole, as well as the adult frog, appeared to be similar, and to involve a combination of CP-synthetase synthesis, precursor conversion, and degradation. The lag phase observed during induction of CP-synthetase synthesis and activity during thyroxine immersion in vivo was not observed in the liver cube preparations, suggesting the possibility of a repressor mechanism in vivo that was not operative in vitro. The nature of the repressor (or repressors) remains unknown."

No significant differences were found in the distribution of 32P in oligonucleotides obtained by pancreatic digestion of 28 S ribosomal RNA and nucleolar 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S RNA. Moreover, no discernible differences were noted in the electrophoretic mobilities of the large fragments obtained from 28 S rRNA, nucleolar 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S RNA after limited T1 RNase digestion. An electrophoretically homogeneous fragment referred to as the B3a fragment was obtained from the T1 RNase digest of ribosomal 28 S RNA and nucleolar 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S RNA. The B3a fragment contains 81% guanylic and cytidylic acid residues and has an approximate molecular weight of 200,000 and a Tm of 75°. On further hydrolysis by T1 RNase, smaller products of the B3a fragment were produced; one of these, the B4 fragment, which has an approximate molecular weight of 150,000, was obtained in an electrophoretically homogeneous state. This distribution of 32P in oligonucleotides of the B3a fragment of 28 S rRNA and nucleolar 28 S RNA was essentially the same. For other fragments, including the B4 fragment and the double band containing B3a and B3b, the oligonucleotide frequencies were essentially the same for 28 S ribosomal RNA and nucleolar 28 S, 35 S, and 45 S RNA."
https://openalex.org/W1503132866,"Abstract Suspensions of fat cells were prepared from rat epididymal adipose tissue by digestion of the tissue with crude bacterial collagenase. One portion of each suspension was exposed to p-chloromercuribenzenesulfonic acid (CMS), washed, and then incubated in Krebs-Ringer-bicarbonate buffer. A second portion, the control, was not exposed to CMS, but it was otherwise treated identically. Acceleration of glucose transport was estimated from the rate of conversion of glucose-14C to 14CO2 and 14C-labeled lipids. Inhibition of the lipolytic action of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was evaluated by measuring (a) the cyclic 3',5'-AMP concentration of the cell suspensions and (b) the rate of release of glycerol into the incubation medium. The optimal concentration of CMS was 10-3 m and the optimal exposure time was 30 min. Glucose utilization by cells exposed to CMS was 5 to 20 times that of the control, but only 50 to 80% that of cells maximally stimulated by insulin. Most of the increased glucose utilization was due to increased glucose entry via a specific transport system since glucose utilization, when stimulated by CMS, was inhibited by 3-O-methyl glucose. Cells exposed to CMS showed a slight increase in nonspecific permeability, however, since (a) there was a slight increase in the amount of malic dehydrogenase appearing in the incubation medium, and (b) stimulation by CMS plus insulin exceeded that of insulin alone when the glucose concentration of the incubation medium was l20 mm. Incubation of CMS exposed cells in 2,3-dimercaptopropanol resulted in partial reversal of the stimulatory effect of CMS. Exposure of cells to CMS inhibited lipolysis both in the basal state and when lipolysis was stimulated by ACTH. This inhibition was overcome either by a 10-fold increase in the concentration of ACTH or by the addition of theophylline, showing that the CMS exposure had not irreversibly inhibited the lipolytic enzymes of the cell. The antilipolytic action of CMS was probably mediated through an effect on the adenyl cyclase system since the increase in cyclic 3',5'-AMP produced by ACTH was inhibited by the CMS exposure. This inhibitory effect of CMS was likewise overcome by a 10-fold increase in the ACTH concentration. We concluded that the metabolism of CMS-treated fat cells mimicked that of cells incubated with insulin in that glucose transport was stimulated and lipolysis was reversibly inhibited. Since the reaction of CMS with isolated fat cells seemed analogous to its reaction with the sulfhydryl groups of other proteins, we postulated that the insulin-like actions of CMS were mediated through a combination between CMS and certain sulfhydryl containing elements located on or near the cell surface."

Sedimentation velocity experiments indicate that no subunit is formed under these conditions. In 3 m guanidine hydrochloride, the sedimentation equilibrium data suggest the presence of a reversible association-dissociation system. Ethylenediaminetetraacetate removes zinc but has no effect on sedimentation equilibrium behavior of the enzyme in 3 m guanidine hydrochloride. Reduction and alkylation of the enzyme in 3 m guanidine hydrochloride results in almost complete dissociation into two subunits. Thus, it appears that sulfhydryl residues may be involved in subunit association, whereas zinc plays little or no role. After correction for guanidine binding, the z-average molecular weight of the enzyme in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride containing mercaptoethanol is 41,000. Measurements of molecular weight, sedimentation coefficient, and intrinsic viscosity of the enzyme in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride all indicate that the structure of horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase is composed of two subunits."

These currents varied linearly with the axon's membrane potential, and showed an intercept on the voltage axis at, or near, the sodium equilibrium potential. The intercept shifted in seawater containing less sodium by even more than the shift in the sodium equilibrium potential. It is concluded that the transmitter at this synapse causes a significant change in the sodium conductance only."
https://openalex.org/W1590158586,"Abstract Triiodothyronine has been found to inhibit horse liver alcohol dehydrogenase competitively with respect to NAD+ and NADH; the φ1 and φ'1 values are increased 10-fold in the presence of 10 µm triiodothyronine. The dissociation constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex was determined spectrofluorometrically by competitive titration and found to be 6.7 µm. The competitive inhibition constant determined kinetically was 6.3 to 6.6 µm. The stoichiometry of binding was determined by measuring protein fluorescence quenching in the presence of triiodothyronine, and it was found that 1 mole of triiodothyronine binds per eq of liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Yonetani-Theorell plots show that triiodothyronine hinders the binding of ADP-ribose, but not that of 1,10-phenanthroline, which is known to chelate zinc in liver alcohol dehydrogenase. Evidence suggests that triiodothyronine interferes with coenzyme binding by blocking the binding site of the ADP-ribose portion of the coenzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1613076695,"Abstract The chemical structure of the major component of the nucleotides isolated from Micrococcus lysodeikticus cells was established as being that of uridine 5-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-glucopyranosyluronic acid pyrophosphate) by comparison of the products of hydrolysis of the nucleotide and of its reduced derivative with authentic 2-amino-2-deoxy-d-glucuronic acid and with 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-glucose, respectively. The base was identified by examination of the ultraviolet spectra at various wave lengths; the anomeric configuration of the amino sugar residue was established by comparison of the optical rotation with that of other sugar nucleotides; and the ring configuration of the amino sugar residue was determined by periodate oxidation to give glyceric acid."

Cells growing with a limited supply of energy show an elevated bacteriochlorophyll content and increased resistance to breakdown of the ""permeability barrier"" by these agents. It seems that purple bacteria respond to energy restriction by preferentially synthesizing excess bacteriochlorophyll-membrane which, in effect, toughens the cell integument."
https://openalex.org/W1542857208,"Malic-lactic transhydrogenase forms abortive complexes with all substrates and products of the reaction. Kinetic data for the reversible transhydrogenation suggest that reduced enzyme forms nonreactive complexes with either lactate or malate, and that oxidized enzyme forms nonreactive complexes with either pyruvate or oxalacetate. The kinetic parameters of the enzyme have been evaluated from kinetic data obtained in the inhibitory substrate region. Consistency of parameters is shown by the fact that (a) theoretical and experimental reciprocal plots are in agreement over a wide range of substrate concentration, and (b) parameters combine to give the correct equilibrium constant. In support of kinetic data, spectrophotometric evidence has been obtained for the existence of complexes between oxidized enzyme and either of the keto acid substrates. The spectra of these complexes, as well as estimates of their dissociation constants, suggest that these intermediates are abortive enzyme·DPN+·keto acid complexes, similar to the enzyme·DPN+·pyruvate complex demonstrated for lactic dehydrogenase (Fromm, H. J., Biochim. Biophys. Acta, 52, 199 (1961)). Supporting evidence for the existence of complexes between reduced enzyme and hydroxy acids comes from experiments which show that lactate and malate strongly inhibit the rate at which the fluorescence of enzymebound DPNH decays when reduced transhydrogenase is added to urea. Kinetic data also suggest that chloride and acetate form nonreactive complexes with both reduced and oxidized enzyme. The existence of an enzyme·DPN+·chloride complex is further supported by spectrophotometric experiments, which show that chloride causes dissociation of the complex formed between pyruvate and oxidized enzyme. Chloride and acetate also inhibit the fluorescence decay of bound DPNH in urea solution, providing auxiliary evidence for complex formation between reduced enzyme and anions. The stabilization of reduced enzyme by malate, lactate, acetate, and chloride makes it possible to estimate the true dissociation constants of complexes formed between reduced enzyme and these anions. At substrate concentrations below the inhibitory level, present kinetic data are consistent with a mechanism for transhydrogenation in which the first product is liberated before the second substrate binds to the enzyme."
