https://openalex.org/W2090600947,"Recent developments in the techniques for making precision measurements and their use in the determination of the fundamental constants are reviewed. Particularly noteworthy developments are clocks with high stability, the proposed redefinition of the meter in terms of the standard for time, and the increased precision with which electrical standards can be maintained. The relevance of precision measurements to tests of general relativity is briefly discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1986368872,An x-ray diffraction study of lead under pressure has shown that face-centered cubic structure transforms to the hexagonal close-packed structure at room temperature and a pressure of 130+/- 10 kilobars. The volume change for the transformation is -0.18+/- 0.06 cubic centimeter per mole.
https://openalex.org/W1984247916,Silicon oxynitride occurs as a mineral (sinoite) in meteorites. Equilibrium measurements are reported which provide information on the approximate ratios of pressures of oxygen to nitrogen required for existence of this phase under equilibrium conditions at elevated temperatures. This ratio is approximately 10-(15) at 1400 degrees to 1500 degrees C.

Prehistoric peoples moved into this area from two separate areas-insular southeast Asia and eastern Melanesia. The high islands of western Micronesia were settled at least 4000 years ago. Settlement in eastern Micronesia occurred at least 2000 years ago. On high islands, complex, stratified societies developed, each with distinctive material remains. Atolls have proved to be significant sources of archeological materials and figure prominently in the prehistory of the area."
https://openalex.org/W2010144527,"Undulating dunelike deposits of surface debris, widespread over parts of the lunar landscape, are similar in form but greater in size than base-surge deposits found in many maar volcanoes and tuff rings on Earth. The bed forms of base-surge deposits develop by the interaction of the bed materials with those in the current passing overhead. Therefore the ""patterned ground"" produced differs from that formed by ballistic fallout."
https://openalex.org/W2013085196,"Organ cultures of hindgut from diapausing tobacco hornworm pupae, Manduca sexta (Johannson), produce an abundance of migrant cells around the original explant. With time-lapse cinematography, these cells were seen to move slowly and tended to aggregate. The addition of ecdysterone (beta-ecdysone) to these cultures stimulated a large increase in individual cell movements and the eventual disruption of cell sheets."
https://openalex.org/W2048487916,"Abundance patterns of rare earths of submarine tholeiitic basalts from the axial trough of the Red Sea resemble those of basalts from mid-ocean ridges but are distinct from shield or plateau basalts of tholeiitic composition. These results imply that Ã  similar magmatic process, related to spreading of sea floors, operates beneath the axial trough of the Red Sea and the crest of mid-ocean ridges."

https://openalex.org/W1999614216,A hydration rate for obsidian of 3.5(4) microns squared per 1000 radio-carbon years has been established at the Nightfire Island archeological site in northern California and provides a means to date other prehistoric Klamath Basin sites. The new rate follows the form of the hydration equation formulated by Friedman and helps to refute claims made for other hydration equations.

https://openalex.org/W2091034328,"Decisions concerned with finding, developing, and extracting nonrenewable resources are dynamically interrelated in complex ways. Economic theory provides a description of this process that yields useful insights, but there are gaps between theory and empirical applications that hinder our understanding of how supply responds to changes in economic incentives. Consequently, many questions concerning market efficiency as opposed to government intervention remain open."

https://openalex.org/W2039868069,Anomalous dark areas in sunglint patterns are occasionally seen in photographs taken by the Applications Technology Sattellte. These dark areas appear to be caused by relatively calm surface conditions against a background of higher sea states. Evidence of cold water temperatures suggest the presence of upwelling. These sightings may thus be of importance to the fishing industry.

Robinson's article ""CERN reports first vector boson evidence"" (Research News, 4 Feb., p. 480). the fifth sentence in the fifth paragraph should have read, ""The annihilation of a quark with charge +2/3 and an antiquark with charge +1/3 produces a W(+), for example."
