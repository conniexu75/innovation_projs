https://openalex.org/W4214950345,"Transplantation of pancreatic islet cells derived from human pluripotent stem cells is a promising treatment for diabetes. Despite progress in the generation of stem-cell-derived islets (SC-islets), no detailed characterization of their functional properties has been conducted. Here, we generated functionally mature SC-islets using an optimized protocol and benchmarked them comprehensively against primary adult islets. Biphasic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion developed during in vitro maturation, associated with cytoarchitectural reorganization and the increasing presence of alpha cells. Electrophysiology, signaling and exocytosis of SC-islets were similar to those of adult islets. Glucose-responsive insulin secretion was achieved despite differences in glycolytic and mitochondrial glucose metabolism. Single-cell transcriptomics of SC-islets in vitro and throughout 6 months of engraftment in mice revealed a continuous maturation trajectory culminating in a transcriptional landscape closely resembling that of primary islets. Our thorough evaluation of SC-islet maturation highlights their advanced degree of functionality and supports their use in further efforts to understand and combat diabetes."

Here, through a genome-wide association study, we identify a variant (rs190509934, minor allele frequency 0.2-2%) that downregulates ACE2 expression by 37% (P = 2.7 × 10-8) and reduces the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection by 40% (odds ratio = 0.60, P = 4.5 × 10-13), providing human genetic evidence that ACE2 expression levels influence COVID-19 risk. We also replicate the associations of six previously reported risk variants, of which four were further associated with worse outcomes in individuals infected with the virus (in/near LZTFL1, MHC, DPP9 and IFNAR2). Lastly, we show that common variants define a risk score that is strongly associated with severe disease among cases and modestly improves the prediction of disease severity relative to demographic and clinical factors alone."
https://openalex.org/W4220697504,"Abstract Potato is the most widely produced tuber crop worldwide. However, reconstructing the four haplotypes of its autotetraploid genome remained an unsolved challenge. Here, we report the 3.1 Gb haplotype-resolved (at 99.6% precision), chromosome-scale assembly of the potato cultivar ‘Otava’ based on high-quality long reads, single-cell sequencing of 717 pollen genomes and Hi-C data. Unexpectedly, ~50% of the genome was identical-by-descent due to recent inbreeding, which was contrasted by highly abundant structural rearrangements involving ~20% of the genome. Among 38,214 genes, only 54% were present in all four haplotypes with an average of 3.2 copies per gene. Taking the leaf transcriptome as an example, 11% of the genes were differently expressed in at least one haplotype, where 25% of them were likely regulated through allele-specific DNA methylation. Our work sheds light on the recent breeding history of potato, the functional organization of its tetraploid genome and has the potential to strengthen the future of genomics-assisted breeding."

https://openalex.org/W4220654690,"Rising breakthrough infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in previously immunized individuals have raised concerns for the need for a booster vaccine dose to combat waning antibody levels and new variants. Here we report the results of the open-label, non-randomized part B of a phase 2 trial in which we evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of a booster injection of 50 µg of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine mRNA-1273 in 344 adult participants immunized 6-8 months earlier with a primary series of two doses of 50 µg or 100 µg of mRNA-1273 ( NCT04405076 ). Neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 at 1 month after the booster were 1.7-fold (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5, 1.9) higher than those at 28 days after the second injection of the primary series, which met the pre-specified non-inferiority criterion (primary immunogenicity objective) and might indicate a memory B cell response. The nAb titers against the Delta variant (B.1.617.2) (exploratory objective) at 1 month after the booster were 2.1-fold (95% CI: 1.8, 2.4) higher than those at 28 days after the second injection of the primary series. The seroresponse rate (95% CI (four-fold rise from baseline)) was 100% (98.7, 100.0) at 28 days after the booster compared to 98.3% (96.0, 99.4) after the primary series. The higher antibody titers at 28 days after the booster dose compared to 28 days after the second dose in the phase 3 COVE study were also observed in two assays for anti-spike IgG antibody measured by ELISA and by Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) Multiplex. The frequency of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions after the booster dose was similar to that after the second dose in the primary two-dose series of mRNA-1273 (50 µg or 100 µg); no new signals were observed in the unsolicited adverse events; and no serious adverse events were reported in the 1-month follow-up period. These results show that a booster injection of mRNA-1273 more than 6 months after completing the primary two-dose series is safe and elicited nAb titers that were statistically significantly higher than the peak titers detected after the primary vaccination series, suggesting that a booster dose of mRNA-1273 might result in increased vaccine effectiveness against infection and disease caused by SARS-CoV-2."
https://openalex.org/W4214837065,"Design of nucleic acid-based viral diagnostics typically follows heuristic rules and, to contend with viral variation, focuses on a genome's conserved regions. A design process could, instead, directly optimize diagnostic effectiveness using a learned model of sensitivity for targets and their variants. Toward that goal, we screen 19,209 diagnostic-target pairs, concentrated on CRISPR-based diagnostics, and train a deep neural network to accurately predict diagnostic readout. We join this model with combinatorial optimization to maximize sensitivity over the full spectrum of a virus's genomic variation. We introduce Activity-informed Design with All-inclusive Patrolling of Targets (ADAPT), a system for automated design, and use it to design diagnostics for 1,933 vertebrate-infecting viral species within 2 hours for most species and within 24 hours for all but three. We experimentally show that ADAPT's designs are sensitive and specific to the lineage level and permit lower limits of detection, across a virus's variation, than the outputs of standard design techniques. Our strategy could facilitate a proactive resource of assays for detecting pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W4220695862,"Many oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) do not differentiate to form myelin, suggesting additional roles of this cell population. The zebrafish optic tectum contains OPCs in regions devoid of myelin. Elimination of these OPCs impaired precise control of retinal ganglion cell axon arbor size during formation and maturation of retinotectal connectivity and degraded functional processing of visual stimuli. Therefore, OPCs fine-tune neural circuits independently of their canonical role to make myelin."
https://openalex.org/W4221051975,"Abstract An increasing number of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have experimentally confirmed functions, yet little is known about their transcriptional dynamics and it is challenging to determine their regulatory effects. Here, we used allele-sensitive single-cell RNA sequencing to demonstrate that, compared to messenger RNAs, lncRNAs have twice as long duration between two transcriptional bursts. Additionally, we observed increased cell-to-cell variability in lncRNA expression due to lower frequency bursting producing larger numbers of RNA molecules. Exploiting heterogeneity in asynchronously growing cells, we identified and experimentally validated lncRNAs with cell state-specific functions involved in cell cycle progression and apoptosis. Finally, we identified cis -functioning lncRNAs and showed that knockdown of these lncRNAs modulated the nearby protein-coding gene’s transcriptional burst frequency or size. In summary, we identified distinct transcriptional regulation of lncRNAs and demonstrated a role for lncRNAs in the regulation of mRNA transcriptional bursting."
https://openalex.org/W4214902164,"Although several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have been approved for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapy, development was generally inefficient, with lead generation often requiring the production and testing of numerous antibody candidates. Here, we report that the integration of target–ligand blocking with a previously described B cell receptor-sequencing approach (linking B cell receptor to antigen specificity through sequencing (LIBRA-seq)) enables the rapid and efficient identification of multiple neutralizing mAbs that prevent the binding of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The combination of target–ligand blocking and high-throughput antibody sequencing promises to increase the throughput of programs aimed at discovering new neutralizing antibodies. B cell receptor sequencing with ligand blocking speeds up neutralizing antibody discovery."
https://openalex.org/W4214822691,"Social media has changed the marketing phenomenon, as firms use social media to inform, impress, and retain the existing consumers. Social media marketing empowers business firms to generate perceived brand equity activities and build the notion among consumers to continue using the firms' products and services. The current exploratory study aimed to examine the effects of social media marketing activities on brand equity (brand awareness and brand image) and repurchase intention of high-tech products among Chinese consumers. The study used a cross-sectional design, and the final analysis was performed on 477 valid responses that were collected through an online survey. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and artificial neural network (ANN) analysis were performed. The obtained results revealed positive and significant effects of trendiness, interaction, and word of mouth on brand awareness. Customisation, trendiness, interaction, and word of mouth were found to positively affect brand image. Brand awareness and brand image were found to affect repurchase intention. The results of multilayer ANN analysis suggested trendiness as the most notable factor in developing brand awareness and brand image. Brand awareness was found to be an influential factor that nurtures repurchase intention. The study's results confirmed the relevance of social media marketing activities in predicting brand equity and brand loyalty by repurchase intention. Marketing professionals need to concentrate on entertainment and customisation aspects of social media marketing that can help to achieve brand awareness and image. The limitations of study and future research opportunities are presented at the end of this article."
https://openalex.org/W4214860017,"Abstract Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are heterogeneous neoplastic disorders of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The current standard of care for patients with MDS is hypomethylating agent (HMA)-based therapy; however, almost 50% of MDS patients fail HMA therapy and progress to acute myeloid leukemia, facing a dismal prognosis due to lack of approved second-line treatment options. As cancer stem cells are the seeds of disease progression, we investigated the biological properties of the MDS HSCs that drive disease evolution, seeking to uncover vulnerabilities that could be therapeutically exploited. Through integrative molecular profiling of HSCs and progenitor cells in large patient cohorts, we found that MDS HSCs in two distinct differentiation states are maintained throughout the clinical course of the disease, and expand at progression, depending on recurrent activation of the anti-apoptotic regulator BCL-2 or nuclear factor-kappa B-mediated survival pathways. Pharmacologically inhibiting these pathways depleted MDS HSCs and reduced tumor burden in experimental systems. Further, patients with MDS who progressed after failure to frontline HMA therapy and whose HSCs upregulated BCL-2 achieved improved clinical responses to venetoclax-based therapy in the clinical setting. Overall, our study uncovers that HSC architectures in MDS are potential predictive biomarkers to guide second-line treatments after HMA failure. These findings warrant further investigation of HSC-specific survival pathways to identify new therapeutic targets of clinical potential in MDS."
https://openalex.org/W4214936950,"Natural history collections are essential to a wide variety of studies in biology because they maintain large collections of specimens and associated data, including genetic material (e.g., tissues) for DNA sequence data, yet they are currently under-funded and collection staff have high workloads. With the advent of aggregate databases and advances in sequencing technologies, there is an increased demand on collection staff for access to tissue samples and associated data. Scientists are rapidly developing large DNA barcode libraries, DNA sequences of specific genes for species across the tree of life, in order to document and conserve biodiversity. In doing so, mistakes are made. For instance, inconsistent taxonomic information is commonly taken from different lending institutions and deposited in data repositories, such as the Barcode of Life Database (BOLD) and GenBank, despite explicit disclaimers regarding the need for taxonomic verification by the lending institutions. Such errors can have profound effects on subsequent research based on these mis-labelled sequences in data repositories. Here, we present the production of a large DNA barcode library of reptiles from the National Museum of Natural History tissue holdings. The library contains 2,758 sequences (2,205 COI and 553 16S) from 2260 specimens (four crocodilians, 37 turtles, and 2,219 lizards, including snakes), representing 583 named species, from 52 countries. In generating this library, we noticed several common mistakes made by scientists depositing DNA barcode data in public repositories (e.g., BOLD and GenBank). Our goal is to raise awareness of these concerns and offer advice to avoid such mistakes in the future to maintain accurate DNA barcode libraries to properly document Earth's biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W4214839342,"Many cancers carry recurrent, change-of-function mutations affecting RNA splicing factors. Here, we describe a method to harness this abnormal splicing activity to drive splicing factor mutation-dependent gene expression to selectively eliminate tumor cells. We engineered synthetic introns that were efficiently spliced in cancer cells bearing SF3B1 mutations, but unspliced in otherwise isogenic wild-type cells, to yield mutation-dependent protein production. A massively parallel screen of 8,878 introns delineated ideal intronic size and mapped elements underlying mutation-dependent splicing. Synthetic introns enabled mutation-dependent expression of herpes simplex virus–thymidine kinase (HSV–TK) and subsequent ganciclovir (GCV)-mediated killing of SF3B1-mutant leukemia, breast cancer, uveal melanoma and pancreatic cancer cells in vitro, while leaving wild-type cells unaffected. Delivery of synthetic intron-containing HSV–TK constructs to leukemia, breast cancer and uveal melanoma cells and GCV treatment in vivo significantly suppressed the growth of these otherwise lethal xenografts and improved mouse host survival. Synthetic introns provide a means to exploit tumor-specific changes in RNA splicing for cancer gene therapy. Synthetic introns tailored for specific splice-factor mutations enable targeted cancer gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4214860512,"Metabolic syndrome (MS) is the simultaneous occurrence of a cluster of predefined cardiovascular risk factors. Although individual MS components are associated with increased risk of cancer, it is still unclear whether the association between MS and cancer differs from the association between individual MS components and cancer. The aim of this matched case-control study was to estimate the association of 13 types of cancer with (1) MS and (2) the diagnosis of 0, 1 or 2 individual MS components.Cases included 183,248 patients ≥40 years from the SIDIAP database with incident cancer diagnosed between January 2008-December 2017. Each case was matched to four controls by inclusion date, sex and age. Adjusted conditional logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between MS and cancer risk, comparing the effect of global MS versus having one or two individual components of MS.MS was associated with an increased risk of the following cancers: colorectal (OR: 1.28, 95%CI: 1.23-1.32), liver (OR: 1.93, 95%CI: 1.74-2.14), pancreas (OR: 1.79, 95%CI: 1.63-1.98), post-menopausal breast (OR: 1.10, 95%CI: 1.06-1.15), pre-menopausal endometrial (OR: 2.14, 95%CI: 1.74-2.65), post-menopausal endometrial (OR: 2.46, 95%CI: 2.20-2.74), bladder (OR: 1.41, 95%CI: 1.34-1.48), kidney (OR: 1.84, 95%CI: 1.69-2.00), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (OR: 1.23, 95%CI: 1.10-1.38), leukaemia (OR: 1.42, 95%CI: 1.31-1.54), lung (OR: 1.11, 95%CI: 1.05-1.16) and thyroid (OR: 1.71, 95%CI: 1.50-1.95). Except for prostate, pre-menopause breast cancer and Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, MS is associated with a higher risk of cancer than 1 or 2 individual MS components. Estimates were significantly higher in men than in women for colorectal and lung cancer, and in smokers than in non-smokers for lung cancer.MS is associated with a higher risk of developing 11 types of common cancer, with a positive correlation between number of MS components and risk of cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4214815915,"During recent years combining GLP-1 and glucagon receptor agonism with the purpose of achieving superior weight loss and metabolic control compared to GLP-1 alone has received much attention. The superior efficacy has been shown by several in preclinical models but has been difficult to reproduce in humans. In this paper, we present the pre-clinical evaluation of NN1177, a long-acting GLP-1/glucagon receptor co-agonist previously tested in clinical trials. To further investigate the contribution from the respective receptors, two other co-agonists (NN1151, NN1359) with different GLP-1-to-glucagon receptor ratios were evaluated in parallel. In the process of characterizing NN1177, species differences and pitfalls in traditional pre-clinical evaluation methods were identified, highlighting the translational challenges in predicting the optimal receptor balance in humans. In diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, NN1177 induced a dose-dependent body weight loss, primarily due to loss of fat mass, and improvement in glucose tolerance. In DIO rats, NN1177 induced a comparable total body weight reduction, which was in contrast mainly caused by loss of lean mass, and glucose tolerance was impaired. Furthermore, despite long half-lives of the three co-agonists, glucose control during steady state was seen to depend on compound exposure at time of evaluation. When evaluated at higher compound exposure, glucose tolerance was similarly improved for all three co-agonists, independent of receptor balance. However, at lower compound exposure, glucose tolerance was gradually impaired with higher glucagon receptor preference. In addition, glucose tolerance was found to depend on study duration where the effect of glucagon on glucose control became more evident with time. To conclude, the pharmacodynamic effects at a given GLP-1-to-glucagon ratio differs between species, depends on compound exposure and study length, complicating the identification of an optimally balanced clinical candidate. The present findings could partly explain the low number of clinical successes for this dual agonism."
https://openalex.org/W4214821345,"This study empirically examined the impact of external debt on economic growth. Also, the interactions of governance, external debt and external debt volatility were further investigated with emphasize on the interective effect of governance as proxied by Kaufmann, D., (2007) quality governance measures such as; government effectiveness, political stability, voice and accountability, regulatory quality and corruption control on economic growth. The study utilized annual time series data, focusing on thirty selected Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries for the period 1997 to 2020. The Dynamic System Generalised Method of Moments estimation technique was adopted while controlling for conventional sources of economic growth. Empirical findings from the study reveal that external debt and external debt volatility have a negative and significant impact on economic growth in SSA. Furthermore, the interaction of governance indicators, external debt and its volatility, had a positive impact on economic growth in SSA. This study recommends that SSA government should endeavor to avoid excessive external debt to promote the regions' capacity to invest in her financial prospects, and to circumvent the danger of repayment of loans using her small income. The SSA governments should also improve the quality of governance by ensuring political stability, minimising corruption, implementing sound policies and regulations that can permit and promote economic growth through the development of the private sector. The governments must ensure that every borrowed debt is properly supervised and utilised for its purposes to spur economic growth. More so, the Guidotti-Greenspan rule of Reserve adequacy should be applied to keep excess borrowings in check."
https://openalex.org/W4214841136,"During the COVID pandemic, many hospitals had to mobilize reinforcement healthcare workers, especially in intensive care (ICUs). We investigated the perceptions and experiences of reinforcement workers deployed to ICUs, and the impact of deployment on their personal and professional lives.For this qualitative study, a random sample of 30 reinforcement workers was drawn from 4 centres participating in the larger PsyCOVID-ICU study. Individual semi-structured interviews were held, recorded, transcribed and analyzed by thematic analysis.Thirty interviews were performed from April to May 2021 (22 nurses, 2 anesthesiology nurses, 6 nurses' aides). Average age was 36.8±9.5 years; 7 participants had no ICU experience. Four major themes emerged, namely: (1) Difficulties with integration, especially for those with no ICU experience; (2) lack of training; (3) difficulties with management, notably a feeling of insufficient communication; (4) Mental distress relating to the unusual work and fear of contaminating their entourage.Healthcare workers deployed as reinforcements to ICUs at the height of the pandemic had a unique experience of the crisis, and identified important gaps in organisation and preparation. They also suffered from a marked lack of training, given the stakes in the management of critically ill patients in the ICU."
https://openalex.org/W4214931647,"Introduction With the vision of achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by the year 2030, many sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries have implemented health insurance schemes that seek to improve access to healthcare for their populace. In this study, we examined the prevalence and factors associated with health insurance coverage in urban sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Materials and methods We used the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 23 countries in SSA. We included 120,037 women and 54,254 men residing in urban centres in our analyses which were carried out using both bivariable and multivariable analyses. Results We found that the overall prevalence of health insurance coverage was 10.6% among females and 14% among males. The probability of being covered by health insurance increased by level of education. Men and women with higher education, for instance, had 7.61 times (95%CI = 6.50–8.90) and 7.44 times (95%CI = 6.77–8.17) higher odds of being covered by health insurance than those with no formal education. Males and females who read newspaper or magazine (Males: AOR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.37–1.57; Females: AOR = 2.19, 95%CI = 1.31–3.66) listened to radio (Males: AOR = 1.29, 95%CI = 1.18–1.41; Females: AOR = 1.42, 95%CI = 1.35–1.51), and who watched television (Males: AOR = 1.80, 95%CI = 1.64–1.97; Females: AOR = 1.86, 95%CI = 1.75–1.99) at least once a week had higher odds of being covered by health insurance. Conclusion The coverage of health insurance in SSA is generally low among urban dwellers. This has negative implications for the achievement of universal health coverage by the year 2030. We recommend increased public education on the benefits of being covered by health insurance using the mass media which we found to be an important factor associated with health insurance coverage. The focus of such mass media education could target the less educated urban dwellers, males in the lowest wealth quintile, and young adults (15–29 years)."
https://openalex.org/W4220891075,"The complex connectivity of the mammalian brain underlies its function, but understanding how interconnected brain regions interact in neural processing remains a formidable challenge. Here we address this problem by introducing a genetic probe that permits selective functional imaging of distributed neural populations defined by viral labeling techniques. The probe is an engineered enzyme that transduces cytosolic calcium dynamics of probe-expressing cells into localized hemodynamic responses that can be specifically visualized by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Using a viral vector that undergoes retrograde transport, we apply the probe to characterize a brain-wide network of presynaptic inputs to the striatum activated in a deep brain stimulation paradigm in rats. The results reveal engagement of surprisingly diverse projection sources and inform an integrated model of striatal function relevant to reward behavior and therapeutic neurostimulation approaches. Our work thus establishes a strategy for mechanistic analysis of multiregional neural systems in the mammalian brain."

https://openalex.org/W3198788718,"Combinatorial threshold-linear networks (CTLNs) are a special class of inhibition-dominated TLNs defined from directed graphs. Like more general TLNs, they display a wide variety of nonlinear dynamics including multistability, limit cycles, quasiperiodic attractors, and chaos. In prior work, we have developed a detailed mathematical theory relating stable and unstable fixed points of CTLNs to graph-theoretic properties of the underlying network. Here we find that a special type of fixed points, corresponding to core motifs, are predictive of both static and dynamic attractors. Moreover, the attractors can be found by choosing initial conditions that are small perturbations of these fixed points. This motivates us to hypothesize that dynamic attractors of a network correspond to unstable fixed points supported on core motifs. We tested this hypothesis on a large family of directed graphs of size n = 5, and found remarkable agreement. Furthermore, we discovered that core motifs with similar embeddings give rise to nearly identical attractors. This allowed us to classify attractors based on structurally-defined graph families. Our results suggest that graphical properties of the connectivity can be used to predict a network's complex repertoire of nonlinear dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W4214858592,"Orthopedic disorders are common among horses, often leading to euthanasia, which often could have been avoided with earlier detection. These conditions often create varying degrees of subtle long-term pain. It is challenging to train a visual pain recognition method with video data depicting such pain, since the resulting pain behavior also is subtle, sparsely appearing, and varying, making it challenging for even an expert human labeller to provide accurate ground-truth for the data. We show that a model trained solely on a dataset of horses with acute experimental pain (where labeling is less ambiguous) can aid recognition of the more subtle displays of orthopedic pain. Moreover, we present a human expert baseline for the problem, as well as an extensive empirical study of various domain transfer methods and of what is detected by the pain recognition method trained on clean experimental pain in the orthopedic dataset. Finally, this is accompanied with a discussion around the challenges posed by real-world animal behavior datasets and how best practices can be established for similar fine-grained action recognition tasks.

https://openalex.org/W4214884584,"Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is an important causal pathogen of healthcare-associated infections, and colistin-resistant strains have recently emerged owing to the increased use of colistin. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS), a single whole-genome sequencing (WGS) protocol can identify and type pathogens, analyze genetic relationships among different pathogens, predict pathogenic transmissions, and detect antibiotic resistance genes. However, only a few studies have applied NGS in studying the resistance mechanism and epidemiology of colistin-resistant A. baumannii. This study aimed to elucidate the resistance mechanism of colistin-resistant A. baumannii and analyze its molecular epidemiology through WGS.The subjects in this study were patients who visited a university hospital between 2014 and 2018. Thirty colistin-resistant strains with high minimum inhibitory concentrations were selected from various patient samples, and WGS was performed. Comparative genomic analysis was performed for the 27 colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains using a colistin-susceptible strain as the reference genome.The WGS analysis found no mutation for lpxA, lpxC, lpx D, pmrA, pmrB, and mcr1, the genes known to be associated with colistin resistance. Fifty-seven coding sequences (CDS) showed differences; they included 13 CDS with known names and functions that contained 21 genes. From the whole-genome multi-locus sequence typing (wgMLST) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analyses, two major clusters were found for the colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains. However, no differences were observed by the time of detection for each cluster, the samples, the pattern of antibiotic resistance, or the patient characteristics. In the conventional MLST following the Oxford scheme, the typing result showed ST1809, ST451, ST191, ST1837, and ST369 in the global clone 2 (GC2), without any relation with the results of wgMLST and SNP analyses.Based on the findings of the resistance gene analysis through WGS and comparative genomic analysis, the potential genes associated with colistin-resistance or CDS were examined. Furthermore, the analysis of molecular epidemiology through WGS regarding colistin-resistant A. baumannii may prove helpful in preventing infection by multidrug-resistant bacteria and controlling healthcare-associated infections."
https://openalex.org/W4214936982,"Myocardial infarction has a high mortality rate worldwide. Therefore, clinical intervention in cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction is essential. Açai pulp is a natural product and has been considered a functional food because of its antioxidant/anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of açai pulp supplementation on cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction in rats. After 7 days of surgery, male Wistar rats were assigned to six groups: sham animals fed standard chow (SA0, n = 14), fed standard chow with 2% açai pulp (SA2, n = 12) and fed standard chow with 5% açai pulp (SA5, n = 14), infarcted animals fed standard chow (IA0, n = 12), fed standard chow with 2% açai pulp (IA2, n = 12), and fed standard chow with 5% açai pulp (IA5, n = 12). After 3 months of supplementation, echocardiography and euthanasia were performed. Açai pulp supplementation, after myocardial infarction, improved energy metabolism, attenuated oxidative stress (lower concentration of malondialdehyde, P = 0.023; dose-dependent effect), modulated the inflammatory process (lower concentration of interleukin-10, P<0.001; dose-dependent effect) and decreased the deposit of collagen (lower percentage of interstitial collagen fraction, P<0.001; dose-dependent effect). In conclusion, açai pulp supplementation attenuated cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction in rats. Also, different doses of açai pulp supplementation have dose-dependent effects on cardiac remodeling."
https://openalex.org/W4214917033,"Polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), the transmembrane transporter of polymeric immunoglobulin A and M, has multiple immune functions. To explore the characteristics of pIgR expression in Bactrian camel lungs, twelve healthy adult (2-7 years old) Bactrian camels were systematically studied. The results showed that pIgR was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm and membrane of ciliated cells, as well as in the cytoplasm and membrane of basal cells, serous cells of bronchial glands, club cells and alveolar type 2 cells in Bactrian camel lungs. Specially, as the bronchial branches extended, the pIgR expression level in ciliated cells significantly declined (p<0.05), and the corresponding bronchial luminal areas obviously decreased (p<0.05). However, pIgR was not expressed in goblet cells, endocrine cells, alveolar type 1 cells and mucous cells of bronchial glands. The results demonstrated that ciliated cells continuously distributed throughout the whole bronchial tree mucosa were the major expression sites of pIgR, and pIgR was also expressed in basal cells, serous cells of bronchial glands, club cells and alveolar type 2 cells, which would facilitate secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) transmembrane transport by pIgR and form an intact protective barrier. Moreover, the pIgR expression level in ciliated cells was positively correlated with the bronchial luminal areas; but negatively correlated with the cleanliness of airflow through the bronchial cross-sections, showing that the pIgR expression level in the bronchial epithelium was inhomogeneous.

Meanwhile, open defecation in particular, is associated with numerous negative health and economic effects. To this end, a number of empirical studies have been conducted on the determinants of access to sanitation facilities among households in Ghana. Nonetheless, while financial inclusion (sustainable ways of ensuring easier accessibility to cheap and useful financial products and services among individuals/firms) can enhance the ability of households or individuals to afford toilet facilities, hence, could help in curbing open defecation and sharing of toilet facilities among households, the previous studies on Ghana did not pay attention to it. This study therefore uses data from the 7th round of the Ghana Living Standards Survey (GLSS7) to examine the association of financial inclusion with open defecation and sharing of toilet facilities among households in Ghana. The binary logit regression is used as the empirical estimation technique. The results show that, financial inclusion in general is associated with lesser likelihood of open defecation and sharing of toilet facilities among households in Ghana after controlling for welfare quintile, urban or rural residence and other covariates. Moreover, while informal financial inclusion is statistically insignificant, formal financial inclusion is found to be associated with reduced open defecation and sharing of toilet facilities among households. Thus, in the attempt to eliminate open defecation as well as reduce the sharing of toilet facilities among households in Ghana, conscious efforts should be devoted towards enhancing formal financial inclusion."
https://openalex.org/W4214939636,"Myostatin (MSTN) negatively regulates muscle development and positively regulates metabolism through various pathways. Although MSTN function in cattle has been widely studied, the changes in the gut microbiota due to MSTN mutation, which contribute to host health by regulating its metabolism, remain unclear. Here, high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene was conducted to analyze the gut microbiota of wild-type (WT) and MSTN mutant (MT) cattle. A total of 925 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained, which were classified into 11 phyla and 168 genera. Alpha diversity results showed no significant differences between MT and WT cattle. Beta diversity analyses suggested that the microbial composition of WT and MT cattle was different. Three dominant phyla and 21 dominant genera were identified. The most abundant bacterial genus had a significant relationship with the host metabolism. Moreover, various bacteria beneficial for health were found in the intestines of MT cattle. Analysis of the correlation between dominant gut bacteria and serum metabolic factors affected by MSTN mutation indicated that MSTN mutation affected the metabolism mainly by three metabolism-related bacteria, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-013, Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010. This study provides further insight into MSTN mutation regulating the host metabolism by gut microbes and provides evidence for the safety of gene-edited animals."
https://openalex.org/W4214807971,"Introduction Birth asphyxia is a prominent and avoidable cause of infant illness and death worldwide, particularly in underdeveloped countries such as Ethiopia. Early identification and control of the underlying contributory factors would help to alleviate the situation. As a result, the goal of this study was to assess the magnitude and determinants of neonatal asphyxia among live newborns at the northern Gondar public Hospitals in northwest Ethiopia. Materials and methods From April 1 to May 2, 2020, 357 newborns were studied in an institution-based cross-sectional study. The sample size was proportionally distributed among three public hospitals, namely Gondar referral teaching hospital, Debark general hospital, and Kola-Diba District Hospital, which was chosen at random. The number of deliveries given at each hospital six months prior to the data collecting period was used to allocate the hospitals. To get all participants, a systematic random sampling approach was adopted based on hospital delivery registration. The physicians’ evaluation of an APGAR score of 7 in the first and fifth minutes of birth was used as the confirmation of birth asphyxia. Data was collected using a standardized and pretested questionnaire. Variables having p-values less than 0.25 were entered into a multivariable logistic regression analysis in the bivariable analysis. At a p-value of 0.05, a statistically significant level was reported. Results As per the study, the total prevalence of neonatal asphyxia was found to be 27.1 (95% CI: 21.4, 32.7). In a multivariable logistic regression analysis, neonates born to rural mothers (AOR = 2.441, 95% CI: 1.137, 5.241), primiparity (AOR = 5.521 95%CI: 1.691, 8.026), premature rupture of membrane, (AOR = 3.202, 95% CI: 1.484, 6.909) and low birth weight (&lt; 2.5kg) (AOR = 3.706, 95%CI: 3.307, 4.152) were all found to be independent predictors of birth asphyxia. Conclusion This study identified that rural residence, primiparity, premature rupture of membrane, and birth weight were found to be the independent predictors of birth asphyxia. The majority of variables that cause birth asphyxia can be controlled."
https://openalex.org/W4214898894,"In the light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, being considered a present challenge for public health, the main purpose of this work is to analyze the vulnerability to stress of a sample of nursing students in Romania considering their status on labour market (employed students in the medical system and non-employed students) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employed students were more vulnerable to stress comparing to non-employed ones during the pandemic. In addition to this, the nursing students working in the medical system experienced medium vulnerability to stress during the pandemic comparing to those working before the pandemic who experienced a low vulnerability to stress. Excepting the non-employed students before the pandemic, the females were more vulnerable to stress comparing to the males in the sample and the students living in the country experienced a higher level of stress comparing to those living in the urban area. During the pandemic, most of the employed nursing students expressed their fear of getting infected with COVID-19, this representing the most stressful factor for them, while most of them mentioned the self-control as being the most proper strategy for them to cope with stress. These empirical findings have practical implications for stress control among present and future nurses, for management of medical units and for higher education nursing."
https://openalex.org/W4214811547,"Many Muslims with diabetes choose to fast against medical advice during Ramadan, potentially increasing their risk of acute complications. Patients are often reluctant to disclose fasting to their health care providers, and their needs regarding Ramadan are not met in consultations. For healthcare professionals to provide patient-centred care, it is important to gain more insight into patients' decision-making process. This study therefore aims to explore how Muslims with diabetes decide whether to fast during Ramadan.A qualitative study was conducted consisting of 15 focus groups with Muslims with diabetes within a constructivist paradigm. Convenience sampling was used. All focus groups were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using Braun and Clarke's reflexive thematic analysis.Four themes were found to be important in the decision on whether to fast: (1) values and beliefs concerning Ramadan, (2) experiences and emotions concerning Ramadan, (3) the perception of illness, and (4) advice from health care professionals, imams and family. Many participants indicated fasting against medical advice and trusting their subjective assessments on whether they could fast. Moreover, three main stages in the decision-making process for eventually refraining from fasting were identified: (1) the stage where positive experiences with fasting dominate, (2) the stage where one encounters challenges but their determination to fast prevails and (3) the stage where one decides to refrain from fasting after experiencing too many physical difficulties with fasting.Muslims with diabetes experience autonomy in their decisions on Ramadan fasting. The decision to refrain from fasting often resulted from a difficult and dynamic decision-making process and was often made after participants reached their physical limits. These findings highlight the importance of not only shared decision-making to empower patients to make well-informed decisions on Ramadan fasting but also pre-Ramadan diabetes education to help people with diabetes have a safe Ramadan."
https://openalex.org/W4214824580,"Background Nationwide data on thyroid disease prevalence in Greece is lacking. Using the national health examination survey EMENO data resources, we aimed to estimate the prevalence of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism and associated risk factors in adults living in Greece. Methods A random sample of the adults (≥18 years) living in Greece was drawn by multi-stage stratified random sampling based on the 2011 census. During home visits, trained interviewers administered a standardized questionnaire to study participants. All participants answered questions concerning demographic parameters (e.g., age, sex, degree of urbanization, income) and questions concerning smoking habits, alcohol, dietary habits and psychological parameters such as anxiety and thyroid disease. Weighted logistic regression models were fitted to assess factors associated with thyroid disease. Results In total, 6006 individuals were recruited in the Greek Health Examination Survey EMENO (response rate 72%) of whom 5981 were eligible for this study. The prevalence of thyroid disease was 9%, where 0.4% was related to hyperthyroidism and 8.6% to hypothyroidism. The prevalence of thyroid disease was higher in women (14.9%) than men (2.7%) (p&lt;0.001). The highest rates of thyroid disease were observed in former iodine-deficient areas. A decrease in the prevalence of thyroidopathies with increasing alcohol consumption was found. Thyroid disease was associated with anxiety in men. Multivariable regression analysis showed that age, geographic area, and smoking were related to thyroid disease. Conclusion The prevalence of thyroid disease in Greece is higher in women. Age, habits, and characteristics of geographic areas determine the distribution of thyroidopathies in Greece."
https://openalex.org/W4214834189,"This paper describes the architecture and demonstrates the capabilities of a newly developed, physically-based imaging simulator environment called SISPO, developed for small solar system body fly-by and terrestrial planet surface mission simulations. The image simulator utilises the open-source 3-D visualisation system Blender and its Cycles rendering engine, which supports physically based rendering capabilities and procedural micropolygon displacement texture generation. The simulator concentrates on realistic surface rendering and has supplementary models to produce realistic dust- and gas-environment optical models for comets and active asteroids. The framework also includes tools to simulate the most common image aberrations, such as tangential and sagittal astigmatism, internal and external comatic aberration, and simple geometric distortions. The model framework's primary objective is to support small-body space mission design by allowing better simulations for characterisation of imaging instrument performance, assisting mission planning, and developing computer-vision algorithms. SISPO allows the simulation of trajectories, light parameters and camera's intrinsic parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4214854918,"Objectives To assess differences in socio-demographics, HIV testing and healthcare seeking behavior between individuals diagnosed late and those diagnosed early after HIV-acquisition. Design Cross-sectional study among recently HIV-diagnosed migrant and non-migrant individuals living in the Netherlands. Methods Participants self-completed a questionnaire on socio-demographics, HIV-testing and healthcare seeking behavior preceding HIV diagnosis between 2013–2015. Using multivariable logistic regression, socio-demographic determinants of late diagnosis were explored. Variables on HIV-infection, testing and access to care preceding HIV diagnosis were compared between those diagnosed early and those diagnosed late using descriptive statistics. Results We included 143 individuals with early and 101 with late diagnosis, of whom respectively 59/143 (41%) and 54/101 (53%) were migrants. Late diagnosis was significantly associated with older age and being heterosexual. Before HIV diagnosis, 89% of those with early and 62% of those with late diagnosis had ever been tested for HIV-infection ( p &lt;0.001), and respectively 99% and 97% reported healthcare usage in the Netherlands in the two years preceding HIV diagnosis ( p = 0.79). Individuals diagnosed late most frequently visited a general practitioner (72%) or dentist (62%), and 20% had been hospitalized preceding diagnosis. In these settings, only in respectively 20%, 2%, and 6% HIV-testing was discussed. Conclusion A large proportion of people diagnosed late had previously tested for HIV and had high levels of healthcare usage. For earlier-case finding of HIV it therefore seems feasible to successfully roll out interventions within the existing healthcare system. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to encourage future repeated or routine HIV testing among individuals whenever they undergo an HIV test."
https://openalex.org/W4214952749,"In the 12th Five-Year Plan period, Sichuan province has selected strategic emerging industries such as new-generation information technology, new energy, high-end equipment manufacturing, new materials, biology, energy conservation and environmental protection. However, its strategic emerging industries are still in the stage of cultivation and development, and there are some problems such as low industrial agglomeration and obvious industrial restructuring. In essence, this is because the focus of the development of strategic emerging industries is not clear enough, and the location advantages are not fully utilized to select the most suitable strategic emerging industries for the development of the region. This paper constructs a regional strategic emerging industries selection decision model, applies ARCGIS to study the spatial distribution of strategic emerging industries in Sichuan province, and uses fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method (FCEM) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to solve the priority of developing strategic emerging industries. Conclusions: Firstly, Sichuan province should give priority to the development of new generation information technology industry and new energy vehicle industry, then high-end equipment manufacturing industry, energy-saving and environmental protection industry and new energy industry, and finally biological industry and new material industry. The larger the coefficient of influence is, the higher the comprehensive score is, while the larger the coefficient of sensitivity is, the lower the comprehensive score is. Secondly, the number of enterprises in the new-generation information technology industry and the new energy vehicle industry is still not dominant in Sichuan province. Finally, the study found that the current development of strategic emerging industries in Sichuan province is extremely unbalanced in various regions, and the phenomenon of competition and reconstruction is obvious."
https://openalex.org/W4214829791,"The study aims to verify the usefulness of new intervals-based algorithms for clinical interpretation of animal behavior in dairy cows around calving period. Thirteen activities associated with feeding-ruminating-locomotion-behaviors of 42 adult Holstein-Friesian cows were continuously monitored for the week (wk) -2, wk -1 and wk +1 relative to calving (overall 30’340 min/animal). Soon after, animals were retrospectively assigned to group-S (at least one spontaneous diseases; n = 24) and group-H (healthy; n = 18). The average activities performed by the groups, recorded by RumiWatch® halter and pedometer, were compared at the different weekly intervals. The average activities on the day of clinical diagnosis (dd0), as well as one (dd-1) and two days before (dd-2) were also assessed. Differences of dd0 vs. dd-1 (ΔD1), dd0 vs. wk -1 (ΔD2), and wk +1 vs. wk -1 (Δweeks) were calculated. Variables showing significant differences between the groups were used for a univariate logistic regression, a receiver operating characteristic analysis, and a multivariate logistic regression model. At wk +1 and dd0, eating- and ruminating-time , eating- and ruminate-chews and ruminating boluses were significantly lower in group-S as compared to group-H, while other activity time was higher. For ΔD2 and Δweeks, the differences of eating- and ruminating-time , as well as of eating- and ruminate-chews were significantly lower in group-S as compared to group-H. Concerning the locomotion behaviors, the lying time was significantly higher in group-S vs. group-H at wk +1 and dd-2. The number of strides was significantly lower in group-S compared to group-H at wk +1. The model including eating-chews , ruminate-chews and other activity time reached the highest accuracy in detecting sick cows in wk +1 (area under the curve: 81%; sensitivity: 73.7%; specificity: 82.4%). Some of the new algorithms for the clinical interpretation of cow behaviour as described in this study may contribute to monitoring animals’ health around calving."
https://openalex.org/W4214893124,"The prognosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) is highly variable. This study aims to investigate whether skeletal muscle atrophy and myosteatosis are associated with poor outcome after aSAH. In this study, a cohort of 293 consecutive aSAH-patients admitted during a 4-year period was retrospectively analyzed. Cross-sectional muscle measurements were obtained at the level of the third cervical vertebra. Muscle atrophy was defined by a sex-specific cutoff value. Myosteatosis was defined by a BMI-specific cutoff value. Poor neurological outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale 4-6 at 2 and 6-month follow-up. Patient survival state was checked until January 2021. Generalized estimating equation was performed to assess the effect of muscle atrophy / myosteatosis on poor neurological outcome after aSAH. Cox regression was performed to analyze the impact of muscle atrophy and myosteatosis on overall survival. The study found that myosteatosis was associated with poor neurological condition (WFNS 4-5) at admission after adjusting for covariates (odds ratio [OR] 2.01; 95%CI 1.05,3.83; P = .03). It was not associated with overall survival (P = .89) or with poor neurological outcomes (P = .18) when adjusted for other prognostic markers. Muscle atrophy was not associated with overall survival (P = .58) or neurological outcome (P = .32) after aSAH. In conclusion, myosteatosis was found to be associated with poor physical condition directly after onset of aSAH. Skeletal muscle atrophy and myosteatosis were however irrelevant to outcome in the Western-European aSAH patient. Future studies are needed to validate these finding."
https://openalex.org/W4214911837,"Published evidence of the cost-effectiveness of alcohol-based handrub (ABH) for the prevention of neonatal bloodstream infections (BSI) is limited in sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of a multimodal hand hygiene involving alcohol-based hand rub (ABH) for the prevention of neonatal BSI in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) setting in Ghana using data from HAI-Ghana study. Design was a before and after intervention study using economic evaluation model to assess the cost-effectiveness of a multimodal hand hygiene strategy involving alcohol-based hand rub plus soap and water compared to existing practice of using only soap and water. We measured effect and cost by subtracting outcomes without the intervention from outcomes with the intervention. The primary outcome measure is the number of neonatal BSI episode averted with the intervention and the consequent cost savings from patient and provider perspectives. The before and after intervention studies lasted four months each, spanning October 2017 to January 2018 and December 2018 to March 2019, respectively. The analysis shows that the ABH program was effective in reducing patient cost of neonatal BSI by 41.7% and BSI-attributable hospital cost by 48.5%. Further, neonatal BSI-attributable deaths and extra length of hospital stay (LOS) decreased by 73% and 50% respectively. Also, the post-intervention assessment revealed the ABH program contributed to 16% decline in the incidence of neonatal BSI at the NICU. The intervention is a simple and adaptable strategy with cost-saving potential when carefully scaled up across the country. Though the cost of the intervention may be more relative to using just soap and water for hand hygiene, the outcome is a good reason for investment into the intervention to reduce the incidence of neonatal BSI and the associated costs from patient and providers' perspectives."
https://openalex.org/W4220826969,"Iron metabolism is crucial to maintain optimal physiological homeostasis of every organism and any alteration of the iron concentration (i.e. deficit or excess) can have adverse consequences. Transferrins are glycoproteins that play important role in iron transportation and have been widely characterized in vertebrates and insects, but poorly studied in blood-feeding mosquitoes.We characterized a 2102 bp long transcript AcTrf1a with complete CDS of 1872bp, and 226bp UTR region, encoding putative transferrin homolog protein from mosquito An. culicifacies. A detailed in silico analysis predicts AcTrf1a encodes 624 amino acid (aa) long polypeptide that carries transferrin domain. AcTrf1a also showed a putative N-linked glycosylation site, a characteristic feature of most of the mammalian transferrins and certain non-blood feeding insects. Structure modelling prediction confirms the presence of an iron-binding site at the N-terminal lobe of the transferrin. Our spatial and temporal expression analysis under altered pathophysiological conditions showed that AcTrf1a is abundantly expressed in the fat-body, ovary, and its response is significantly altered (enhanced) after blood meal uptake, and exogenous bacterial challenge. Additionally, non-heme iron supplementation of FeCl3 at 1 mM concentration not only augmented the AcTrf1a transcript expression in fat-body but also enhanced the reproductive fecundity of gravid adult female mosquitoes. RNAi-mediated knockdown of AcTrf1a causes a significant reduction in fecundity, confirming the important role of transferrin in oocyte maturation.All together our results advocate that detailed characterization of newly identified AcTrf1a transcript may help to select it as a unique target to impair the mosquito reproductive outcome."
https://openalex.org/W4214887728,"Introduction Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. The underlying mechanisms are largely unclear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are RNAs circulating in the blood that can be released into the bloodstream during hypoxia. In the present study, we investigate if OSAS-induced hypoxia results in a release of miRNAs that may mediate OSAS-associated cardiovascular damage. Methods Blood was sampled from 23 OSAS patients before and after a polygraphically monitored night. Total circulating RNA was isolated from the plasma and quantified using real-time qPCR. Using a Taqman miRNA array, the levels of 384 different miRNAs were compared between evening and morning after polysomnography. The most highly upregulated miRNA (miRNA-505) and four additionally upregulated miRNAs (miRNA-127, miRNA-133a, miRNA-145, and miRNA-181a) were then quantified in a bigger patient cohort individually. Results Apnea/Hypopnea-Index (AHI) was evaluated and averaged at 26 per hour on nocturnal polygraphy. In an initial miRNA array, a total of 4 miRNAs were significantly regulated. A significant increase of miRNA-145 was observed in the larger patient cohort. No significant changes in concentration were detected for miRNA-127, miRNA-133a, miRNA-181a, and miRNA-505 in this larger cohort. Conclusion OSAS results in the nocturnal release of miRNAs into the bloodstream. Our collected data may indicate a hypoxia-induced release of miRNAs into the bloodstream of OSAS-patients. In vitro experiments are needed to confirm the secretion of these miRNAs under hypoxia and evaluate the effect on the cardio vasculature."
https://openalex.org/W4214907811,"The introduction and analysis of a simple idealized model enables basic insights into how military characteristics and recruitment strategies affect the dynamics of armed conflicts, even in the complex case of three or more fighting groups. In particular, the model shows when never ending wars (stalemates) are possible and how initial conditions and interventions influence a conflict's fate. The analysis points out that defensive recruitment policies aimed at compensating for suffered losses lead to conflicts with simple dynamics, while attack groups sensitive to the damages they inflict onto their enemies can give rise to conflicts with turbulent behaviours. Since non-governmental groups often follow attack strategies, the conclusion is that the evolution of conflicts involving groups of that kind can be expected to be difficult to forecast."
https://openalex.org/W4214932308,"Bioturbators shape their environment with considerable consequences for ecosystem processes. However, both the composition and the impact of bioturbator communities may change along climatic gradients. For burrowing animals, their abundance and composition depend on climatic and other abiotic components, with ants and mammals dominating in arid and semiarid areas, and earthworms in humid areas. Moreover, the activity of burrowing animals is often positively associated with vegetation cover (biotic component). These observations highlight the need to understand the relative contributions of abiotic and biotic components in bioturbation in order to predict soil-shaping processes along broad climatic gradients. In this study, we estimated the activity of animal bioturbation by counting the density of holes and the quantity of bioturbation based on the volume of soil excavated by bioturbators along a gradient ranging from arid to humid in Chile. We distinguished between invertebrates and vertebrates. Overall, hole density (no/ 100 m 2 ) decreased from arid (raw mean and standard deviation for invertebrates: 14 ± 7.8, vertebrates: 2.8 ± 2.9) to humid (invertebrates: 2.8 ± 3.1, vertebrates: 2.2 ± 2.1) environments. However, excavated soil volume did not follow the same clear geographic trend and was 300-fold larger for vertebrates than for invertebrates. The relationship between bioturbating invertebrates and vegetation cover was consistently negative whereas for vertebrates both, positive and negative relationships were determined along the gradient. Our study demonstrates complex relationships between climate, vegetation and the contribution of bioturbating invertebrates and vertebrates, which will be reflected in their impact on ecosystem functions."
https://openalex.org/W4214948017,"Response activation and inhibition are functions fundamental to executive control that are disrupted in Parkinson disease (PD). We used magnetoencephalography to examine event related changes in oscillatory power amplitude, peak latency and frequency in cortical networks subserving these functions and identified abnormalities associated with PD. Participants (N = 18 PD, 18 control) performed a cue/target task that required initiation of an un-cued movement (activation) or inhibition of a cued movement. Reaction times were variable but similar across groups. Task related responses in gamma, alpha, and beta power were found across cortical networks including motor cortex, supplementary and pre- supplementary motor cortex, posterior parietal cortex, prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate. PD-related changes in power and latency were noted most frequently in the beta band, however, abnormal power and delayed peak latency in the alpha band in the pre-supplementary motor area was suggestive of a compensatory mechanism. PD peak power was delayed in pre-supplementary motor area, motor cortex, and medial frontal gyrus only for activation, which is consistent with deficits in un-cued (as opposed to cued) movement initiation characteristic of PD."
https://openalex.org/W3127683607,"Word vector representations enable machines to encode human language for spoken language understanding and processing. Confusion2vec, motivated from human speech production and perception, is a word vector representation which encodes ambiguities present in human spoken language in addition to semantics and syntactic information. Confusion2vec provides a robust spoken language representation by considering inherent human language ambiguities. In this paper, we propose a novel word vector space estimation by unsupervised learning on lattices output by an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. We encode each word in Confusion2vec vector space by its constituent subword character n-grams. We show that the subword encoding helps better represent the acoustic perceptual ambiguities in human spoken language via information modeled on lattice-structured ASR output. The usefulness of the proposed Confusion2vec representation is evaluated using analogy and word similarity tasks designed for assessing semantic, syntactic and acoustic word relations. We also show the benefits of subword modeling for acoustic ambiguity representation on the task of spoken language intent detection. The results significantly outperform existing word vector representations when evaluated on erroneous ASR outputs, providing improvements up-to 13.12% relative to previous state-of-the-art in intent detection on ATIS benchmark dataset. We demonstrate that Confusion2vec subword modeling eliminates the need for retraining/adapting the natural language understanding models on ASR transcripts."

Infection with HBV during pregnancy can result in life-threatening complications to both mother and child. To improve their quality of life, the free maternal care was introduced to grant pregnant women cost-free access to antenatal and postnatal services. The study analysed the prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women receiving free antenatal care in a tertiary hospital in Ghana. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study, where secondary data of pregnant women who accessed free antenatal services at the Trafalga hospital, Ho, from 2016 to 2017 were retrieved from the hospital's database. Data on hepatitis B surface antigen reactivity test, age and period of turnout were analysed with Microsoft Excel and Graph pad prism version 6. A total of 2,634 pregnant women assessed free antenatal care from January 2016 -December 2017, with 10% rise in turnout in 2017. The age of the study population was fairly young, ranging from 13-52 years and mean of 29.87±5.83. The prevalence of HBV infection among pregnant women in the entire study was estimated to be 6.0%, while that of 2016 and 2017 were 5.3% and 6.7% respectively. Turnout for antenatal services peaked in July, which also recorded the highest prevalence of HBV infection among the pregnant women. Our study, first of its kind show an HBV prevalence of 6.0% among a large population of pregnant women who accessed free antenatal services at a tertiary hospital in Ghana. The study evaluates the influence of the free maternal care policy on antenatal attendance and HBV infection rates among pregnant women."

https://openalex.org/W4214857540,"Malaria and HIV/AIDS are the two most common infections in sub Saharan Africa (SSA) and worldwide. HIV infected individuals in malaria endemic areas experience severe malaria episodes. The immunological basis of this clinical observation is unclear and the hematologic abnormalities such as anemia in malaria and HIV co infected patients were inconsistent from studies in the past. Ethiopia's three-fourth of the landmass is malarious and HIV prevalence is high that significantly affect RBC indices and other hematologic profiles.This study aimed to compare RBC indices and anemia in HIV patients' co-infected with malaria and those HIV patients without malaria and correlates these with CD4 level.A comparative cross-sectional study was employed on 103 malaria-HIV/AIDS co infected (MHC) and 103 HIV patients without malaria on HAART of the same ART centers in Bench Sheko Zone. Data was collected by structured questionnaire and blood samples were collected from both groups for malaria test and RBC indices measurement. Data was entered and checked in Epi-data and exported to IBM SPSS version 21 software packages for analysis.There were significant differences in Mean±SD of RBC indices between the two groups (P<0.001). RBC, Hgb, HCT and MCV were lower in MHC patients. In total study participants, significant positive correlation was observed between CD4 count with MCV, CD4 count with MCH and CD4 count with anemia. In the group of malaria-HIV co-infected, CD4 count with RBC and CD4 count with Hgb and in HIV without malaria CD4 count with MCV, CD4 count with MCH and CD4 count with MCHC were positively correlated. Overall anemia prevalence was 45.1%. Anemia prevalence in MHC (Malaria-HIV co-infected) was 63.4%. Anemia prevalence distribution among sex showed that 61.3% in female sex and anemia prevalence distribution among CD4 group showed 55.9% in patients with CD4 count of ≤500 cells/μl. Anemia in MHC patients was higher in those with CD4 count of ≤500 cells/μl (59.3%) while in OH (Only HIV infected) anemia prevalence was similar in those with CD4 count of ≤500 and ≥500 cells/μl (50%). There is significant difference in anemia in MHC and OH infected with different CD4 group (P<0.01).There was a difference in RBC indices in both groups; RBC, Hgb, HCT and MCV were lower in MHC patients. There was positive correlation between CD4 counts with some RBC indices in combined both groups. However, there was positive correlation between CD4 counts with RBC and Hgb in malaria-HIV co-infected. The combined prevalence of anemia was higher and anemia in MHC was greater than OH infected patients."
https://openalex.org/W4214862809,"Ecological control of blackflies (Simulium damnosum) can be an alternative or additional tool to enhance onchocerciasis elimination efforts. However, limited research is conducted on the ecology of blackflies in Ethiopia. In this study, we determined the habitat preference of blackfly larvae and their relationship with aquatic macroinvertebrate predators in the Omo Gibe river basin of southwest Ethiopia. Environmental and biological data were collected from 150 sampling sites during both dry and wet seasons in 2019. Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) were used to identify factors affecting the occurrence and abundance of S. damnosum larvae. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was used to investigate the relationship between environmental and biological variables and the abundance of S. damnosum larvae. The findings of this study indicated the abundance of S. damnosum larvae increased with increasing turbidity, alkalinity and altitude, but decreased with increasing concentrations of five-day Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD5), orthophosphate and magnesium ion. Both the presence and abundance of S. damnosum larvae decreased with the increasing abundance of stonefly larvae (Perlidae). Simulium damnosum larvae were found less likely in the presence of mayfly larvae (Baetidae) and were less abundant where Chironomidae are abundant. In conclusion, the findings of this study showed that the habitat preference of S. damnosum larvae is determined by environmental factors and that the presence and abundance of the larvae are affected by macroinvertebrate predators. It is essential to establish buffer zones as a part of watershed management to retain pollutants and prevent them from entering directly into water courses to improve water quality and the assemblages of macroinvertebrate predators and enhance biocontrol of blackflies."

Here, we routinely infected A172 and U251 cells with lentiviral vectors, in which aquaporin-8 (AQP8) was knocked out using CRISPR/Cas9. Our results indicated that cryopreservation did not significantly alter the viral infection efficiency, but influenced AQP8 expression in the infected cells at both protein and mRNA levels compared with the non-cryopreserved samples. Further, AQP8 expression at protein and mRNA levels in recovered cryopreserved infected cells did not significantly differ from those in the blank and negative controls, indicating that the lentivirus was still infectious at low temperatures. However, it failed to release the AQP8-targeting guide RNA in the infected cells, or the guide RNA was released, but underwent changes that caused it to malfunction in the cells with CRISPR/Cas9-mediated AQP8 knock-out. Our findings possibly provide some insights into the reliability of lentiviruses as CRISPR/Cas9 vectors."
https://openalex.org/W4214888758,"Evaluation of the passenger departure efficiency of a comprehensive transport hub is essential for traffic managers. Through the evaluation, security risks in the hub can be found in time to ensure the safe departure of passengers. The attention of existing studies has focused on the analysis of the overall situation of the hub, and the quantitative description of departure status in different connection areas inside the hub is insufficient. In this study, a multilayer hybrid model based on an analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method was established. The data collected using Wi-Fi probe technology were clustered by a K-means algorithm. The first level of the model was divided according to the connection areas of the passenger hub, and the second level was based on the number of stranded people, wait time and departure time in each connection area. It was found that the SP index has the greatest impact on departure efficiency. In addition, the impact of passenger flow aggregation on each connection area is different, and the management department should treat it accordingly. The applicability of the proposed multilayer hybrid model was verified in the example of the Chongqing north railway station."
