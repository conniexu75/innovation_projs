https://openalex.org/W4210339745,"As of late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to health care systems worldwide. Rapidly rising local COVID-19 incidence rates, result in demand for high hospital and intensive care bed capacities on short notice. A detailed up-to-date regional surveillance of the dynamics of the pandemic, precise prediction of required inpatient capacities of care as well as a centralized coordination of the distribution of regional patient fluxes is needed to ensure optimal patient care. In March 2020, the German federal state of Saxony established three COVID-19 coordination centers located at each of its maximum care hospitals, namely the University Hospitals Dresden and Leipzig and the hospital Chemnitz. Each center has coordinated inpatient care facilities for the three regions East, Northwest and Southwest Saxony with 36, 18 and 29 hospital sites, respectively. Fed by daily data flows from local public health authorities capturing the dynamics of the pandemic as well as daily reports on regional inpatient care capacities, we established the information and prognosis tool DISPENSE. It provides a regional overview of the current pandemic situation combined with daily prognoses for up to seven days as well as outlooks for up to 14 days of bed requirements. The prognosis precision varies from 21% and 38% to 12% and 15% relative errors in normal ward and ICU bed demand, respectively, depending on the considered time period. The deployment of DISPENSE has had a major positive impact to stay alert for the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic and to allocate resources as needed. The application of a mathematical model to forecast required bed capacities enabled concerted actions for patient allocation and strategic planning. The ad-hoc implementation of these tools substantiates the need of a detailed data basis that enables appropriate responses, both on regional scales in terms of clinic resource planning and on larger scales concerning political reactions to pandemic situations."
https://openalex.org/W4210499118,"Breast cancer is one of the worst illnesses, with a higher fatality rate among women globally. Breast cancer detection needs accurate mammography interpretation and analysis, which is challenging for radiologists owing to the intricate anatomy of the breast and low image quality. Advances in deep learning-based models have significantly improved breast lesions' detection, localization, risk assessment, and categorization. This study proposes a novel deep learning-based convolutional neural network (ConvNet) that significantly reduces human error in diagnosing breast malignancy tissues. Our methodology is most effective in eliciting task-specific features, as feature learning is coupled with classification tasks to achieve higher performance in automatically classifying the suspicious regions in mammograms as benign and malignant. To evaluate the model's validity, 322 raw mammogram images from Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) and 580 from Private datasets were obtained to extract in-depth features, the intensity of information, and the high likelihood of malignancy. Both datasets are magnificently improved through preprocessing, synthetic data augmentation, and transfer learning techniques to attain the distinctive combination of breast tumors. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed approach achieved remarkable training accuracy of 0.98, test accuracy of 0.97, high sensitivity of 0.99, and an AUC of 0.99 in classifying breast masses on mammograms. The developed model achieved promising performance that helps the clinician in the speedy computation of mammography, breast masses diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up of disease progression. Moreover, it has the immense potential over retrospective approaches in consistency feature extraction and precise lesions classification."
https://openalex.org/W4210261992,"The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire- 7 (GAD-7) are short screening instruments used for detection of depression and anxiety symptoms in various settings, including general and mental health care as well as the general population. The aim of this study is to evaluate psychometric properties and factorial structure of the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 in a sample of Lithuanian university students.1368 students (mean age 22.5±4.8) completed the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 questionnaires online; after the completion of the survey, students were asked to provide phone contact for an additional interview. Eligible students were approached later by trained interviewers and completed The Clinical Interview Schedule-Revised for assessment of depressive and anxiety disorders.Results showed that the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 are reliable screening tools for depression and anxiety (Cronbach alpha 0.86 and 0.91, respectively). The one-factor structure of the PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 was confirmed by the Confirmatory Factor Analysis. A cut-off of ≥10 for the PHQ-9 resulted in 71% sensitivity and 66% specificity recognizing students with increased risk for mood or anxiety disorder. For the GAD-7, a cut-off ≥9 resulted in 73% sensitivity and 70% specificity recognizing students at risk. The PHQ-9 was sensitive but not specific in recognizing students with depressive disorders. The sensitivity and specificity of the GAD-7 in differentiating students with generalized anxiety disorders were low.The PHQ-9 and the GAD-7 have sufficient formal psychometric properties, but their clinical utility as diagnostic tools for recognition of depressive and anxiety disorders in students is limited. Due to low specificity and high false positive rates, both scales are recommended only as an initial screening tool for recognition of subjects with increased risk of mental disorders, however positive cases should be later assessed using more comprehensive instruments."
https://openalex.org/W4210374324,"In medical image classification tasks, it is common to find that the number of normal samples far exceeds the number of abnormal samples. In such class-imbalanced situations, reliable training of deep neural networks continues to be a major challenge, therefore biasing the predicted class probabilities toward the majority class. Calibration has been proposed to alleviate some of these effects. However, there is insufficient analysis explaining whether and when calibrating a model would be beneficial. In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the effect of model calibration on its performance on two medical image modalities, namely, chest X-rays and fundus images, using various deep learning classifier backbones. For this, we study the following variations: (i) the degree of imbalances in the dataset used for training; (ii) calibration methods; and (iii) two classification thresholds, namely, default threshold of 0.5, and optimal threshold from precision-recall (PR) curves. Our results indicate that at the default classification threshold of 0.5, the performance achieved through calibration is significantly superior (p < 0.05) to using uncalibrated probabilities. However, at the PR-guided threshold, these gains are not significantly different (p > 0.05). This observation holds for both image modalities and at varying degrees of imbalance. The code is available at https://github.com/sivaramakrishnan-rajaraman/Model_calibration."
https://openalex.org/W4210254430,"Nutrient use efficiency is crucial for increasing crop yield and quality while reducing fertilizer inputs and minimizing environmental damage. The experiments were carried out in silty clay loam soil of Lalitpur, Nepal, to examine how different amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) influenced crop performance and nutrient efficiency indices in wheat during 2019/20 and 2020/21. The field experiment comprised three factorial randomized complete block designs that were replicated three times. N levels (100, 125, 150 N kg ha-1), P levels (25, 50, 75 P2O5 kg ha-1), and K levels (25, 50, 75 K2O kg ha-1) were three factors evaluated, with a total of 27 treatment combinations. Grain yields were significantly increased by N and K levels and were optimum @ 125 kg N ha-1 and @ 50 kg K2O ha-1 with grain yields of 6.33 t ha-1 and 6.30 t ha-1, respectively. Nutrient levels influenced statistically partial factor productivity, internal efficiency, partial nutrient budget, recovery efficiency, agronomic efficiency, and physiological efficiency of NPK for wheat. Nutrient efficiency was found to be higher at lower doses of their respective nutrients. Higher P and K fertilizer rates enhanced wheat N efficiencies, and the case was relevant for P and K efficiencies as well. Wheat was more responsive to N and K fertilizer, and a lower rate of P application reduced N and K fertilizer efficiency. This study recommends to use N @ 125 kg ha-1, P2O5 @ 25 kg ha-1 and K2O @ 50 kg ha-1 as an optimum rate for efficient nutrient management in wheat in mid-hills of Nepal."
https://openalex.org/W4210465458,"Synthetic fertilizer and herbicides encompass the largest share in nutrient and weed management on food grain crops that create serious environmental issues. Integrated nutrient and non-chemical weed management approaches may help to reduce the chemical load in the environment, maintaining higher weed control efficiency and yield. A field experiment was conducted for two consecutive monsoon seasons during 2015 and 2016 in farm fields to develop a profitable and sustainable rice production system through integrated nutrient and weed management practices. A varied combination of nutrients either alone or integrated with chemical and non-chemical weed management were tested on transplanted rice in a factorial randomized block design with three replications. The results showed that the integration of concentrated organic manures with chemical fertilizer effectively inhibited weed growth and nutrient removal. Integration of nutrient and weed management practices significantly enhanced 9% biomass growth, 10% yield of the rice crop along with 3-7% higher nutrient uptake. Brassicaceous seed meal (BSM) and neem cake also had some influence on weed suppression and economic return. Thus, the integrated nutrient and weed management practices in rice cultivation might be an effective way to achieve economic sustainability and efficient rice cultivation in eastern India. Shortages of farmyard manure and vermicompost could be supplemented by BSM and neem cake in the integrated module."
https://openalex.org/W4210747719,"The COVID-19 pandemic started a little later in Ethiopia than the rest of the world and most of the initial cases were reported to have a milder disease course and a favorable outcome. This changed as the disease spread into the population and the more vulnerable began to develop severe disease. Understanding the risk factors for severe disease in Ethiopia was needed to provide optimal health care services in a resource limited setting.The study assessed COVID-19 patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia for characteristics associated with COVID-19 disease severity.A cross-sectional study was conducted from June to August 2020 among 686 randomly selected patients. Chi-square test was used to detect the presence of a statistically significant difference in the characteristics of the patients based on disease severity (Mild vs Moderate vs Severe). A multinomial logistic regression model was used to identify factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity where Adjusted Odds ratio (AOR), 95% CIs for AOR and P-values were used for significance testing.Having moderate as compared with mild disease was significantly associated with having hypertension (AOR = 2.30, 95%CI = 1.27,4.18), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 2.61, 95%CI = 1.31,5.19for diabetes mellitus), fever (AOR = 6.12, 95%CI = 2.94,12.72) and headache (AOR = 2.69, 95%CI = 1.39,5.22). Similarly, having severe disease as compared with mild disease was associated with age group (AOR = 4.43, 95%CI = 2.49,7.85 for 40-59 years and AOR = 18.07, 95%CI = 9.29,35.14for ≥ 60 years), sex (AOR = 1.84, 95%CI = 1.12,3.03), hypertension (AOR = 1.97, 95%CI = 1.08,3.59), diabetes mellitus (AOR = 3.93, 95%CI = 1.96,7.85), fever (AOR = 13.22, 95%CI = 6.11, 28.60) and headache (AOR = 4.82, 95%CI = 2.32, 9.98). In addition, risk factors of severe disease as compared with moderate disease were found to be significantly associated with age group (AOR = 4.87, 95%CI = 2.85, 8.32 for 40-59 years and AOR = 18.91, 95%CI = 9.84,36.331 for ≥ 60 years), fever (AOR = 2.16, 95%CI = 1.29,3.63) and headache (AOR = 1.79, 95%CI = 1.03, 3.11).Significant factors associated with severe COVID-19 in Ethiopia are being older than 60 years old, male, a diagnosis of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and the presence of fever and headache. This is consistent with severity indicators identified by WHO and suggests the initial finding of milder disease in Ethiopia may have been because the first people to get COVID-19 in the country were the relatively younger with fewer health problems."
https://openalex.org/W4210296462,"Quality control of biopharmaceuticals such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) has been evolving and becoming more challenging as the requirements of the regulatory agencies increase due to the demanding complexity of products under evaluation. Mass Spectrometry (MS)-based methods such as the multi-attribute method (MAM) are being explored to achieve a deeper understanding of the attributes critical for the safety, efficacy, and quality of these products. MAM uses high mass accuracy/high-resolution MS data that enables the direct and simultaneous monitoring of relevant product quality attributes (PQAs, in particular, chemical modifications) in a single workflow, replacing several orthogonal methods, reducing time and costs associated with these assays. Here we describe a MAM implementation process using a QTOF high resolution platform. Method implementation was accomplished using NIST (National Institute for Standards and Technology) mAb reference material and an in-process mAb sample. PQAs as glycosylation profiles, methionine oxidation, tryptophan dioxidation, asparagine deamidation, pyro-Glu at N-terminal and glycation were monitored. Focusing on applications that require batch analysis and high-throughput, sample preparation and LC-MS parameters troubleshooting are discussed. This MAM workflow was successfully explored as reference analytical tool for comprehensive characterization of a downstream processing (DSP) polishing platform and for a comparability study following technology transfer between different laboratories."
https://openalex.org/W4210452783,"This study aims to investigate the influence of all the mixture components of high-performance concrete (HPC) on its early compressive strength, ranging from 1 to 14 days. To this purpose, a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithm was first constructed using a database gathered from the available literature. The database included the contents of cement, blast furnace slag (BFS), fly ash (FA), water, superplasticizer, coarse, fine aggregates, and testing age as input variables to predict the output of the problem, which was the early compressive strength. Several standard statistical criteria, such as the Pearson correlation coefficient, root mean square error and mean absolute error, were used to quantify the performance of the GPR model. To analyze the sensitivity and influence of the HPC mixture components, partial dependence plots analysis was conducted with both one-dimensional and two-dimensional. Firstly, the results showed that the GPR performed well in predicting the early strength of HPC. Second, it was determined that the cement content and testing age of HPC were the most sensitive and significant elements affecting the early strength of HPC, followed by the BFS, water, superplasticizer, FA, fine aggregate, and coarse aggregate contents. To put it simply, this research might assist engineers select the appropriate amount of mixture components in the HPC production process to obtain the necessary early compressive strength."
https://openalex.org/W4210702381,"Rapid diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) and detection of drug resistance are very important for timely and appropriate management of patients. Xpert MTB/RIF assay is approved for use in TB and rifampicin-resistance diagnosis. However, data are limited on the impact of Xpert MTB/RIF assay under routine clinical settings with a heterogeneous group of patients and sample types in Ethiopia.A retrospective study was carried out in 2220 presumptive TB cases at Jimma University Medical Center. Data were gathered from the registration logbook using formatted data extraction tools and double entered to epidata version 3.1 and further transported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Associations were determined using the Chi-square test and P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.Of 2220 cases enrolled, 1665 (75%) were adults and the remaining 555 (25%) were children aged less than 14 years. The majority, 1964 (88.46%), had pulmonary manifestation and 256 (11.54%) had extrapulmonary involvements. The overall, frequency of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) was 9.3% (206/2220), among this 10.27% (171/1665) and 6.3% (35/555) were adults and children, respectively. M. tuberculosis was detected from 171 (8.75%) of pulmonary patients and 35 (13.28%) of extrapulmonary manifested patients. Out of 206 M. tuberculosis positive cases, 7(3.4%) were rifampicin-resistant: four from pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) patients and three from EPTB patients. In the Chi-square test, the age group of 15-24 years, previous history of TB, pus/lymph node sample, and being HIV positive were significantly associated with TB positivity by Xpert MTB/RIF (P-value <0.001).These data suggest that the overall frequency of M. tuberculosis and rifampicin resistance was found to be relatively low compared to the previous reports in Ethiopia. Nevertheless, better diagnostic tools and approaches are still vital to halt the burden of TB and drug-resistant TB in the country."
https://openalex.org/W4210707982,"Inoculation dose is a key operational parameter for the solid-state anaerobic digestion (SS-AD) of lignocellulosic biomass, maximum methane recovery, and stable digester performance. The novelty of this study was the co-digestion of unamended full-strength grape marc and cheese whey for peak methane extraction at variable inoculation levels. An acclimatised digestate from a preceding anaerobic treatment was used as a downstream inoculum. The impact of inoculum size (wet weight) was evaluated at 0/10, 5/5, 7/3 and 9/1 substrate-to-inoculum (S/I) ratios, corresponding to an initial concentration of 20–30% total solids (TS) in digesters over 58 days at 45°C. The optimal 7/3 S/I produced the highest cumulative methane yield, 6.45 L CH 4 kg -1 VS, coinciding with the lowest initial salinity at 11%; the highest volumetric methane productivity rate of 0.289±0.044 L CH 4 L Work -1 d -1 ; the highest average COD/N ratio of 9.88; the highest final pH of 9.13, and a maximum 15.07% elemental carbon removal; for a lag time of 9.4 days. This study identified an optimal inoculation dose and opens up an avenue for the direct co-digestion of grape marc and cheese whey without requirements for substrate pretreatment, thus improving the overall bioenergy profile of the winery and dairy joint resource recovery operations."
https://openalex.org/W4210781793,"Network partitioning and node disconnectivity results in high latency and frequent link disruption in DTNs. Therefore, routing a message toward a destined node is a challenge in such environment. Several DTN routing schemes have been introduced in this regard. Some, recently proposed DTN routing protocols either use a single or combination of multiple social metrics to identify the suitable forwarder node(s). However, these DTN routing protocols produced results at the expense of community formation cost and over utilization of network resources. To address these issues, we propose Socially-Aware Adaptive DTN (SAAD) routing scheme which exploits a social attribute known as Degree Centrality (DC). In this scheme, each node calculates and shares its DC with other nodes at regular intervals. A forwarder node disseminates message to the most influential node possessing highest DC. The proposed routing scheme works great in situations where someone want to improve the energy efficiency and want to involve only relevant nodes. The simulation results show that SAAD has improved to select the best node and has reduced the hop-count, overhead on the expense of delay as compared to Epidemic, PRoPHET and PRoPHETv2."
https://openalex.org/W4210247169,"Epilepsy is a chronic non-communicable brain disorder and the second most burdensome disease in terms of disability-adjusted life years which is characterized by recurrent epileptic seizures, and a constant threat to the quality of life of the patient. Nearly 80% of people with epilepsy live in low- and middle-income countries and the risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is up to three times higher than for the general population. In many parts of the world, people with epilepsy and their families suffer from stigma and discrimination. This study was aimed to assess the quality of life and associated factors among adult people living with epilepsy using the world health organization quality of life assessment tool.Institution-based cross-sectional study design was conducted on 419 epileptic patients using a systematic random sampling technique. The data were collected using the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire. The data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 25 software for further analysis and bivariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analyses were done to identify factors associated with the dependent variable. The level of significance was declared as P value <0.05.A total of 402 epileptic patients with a median age of 28 years were involved in the study. The result of this study was revealed that 47.8% (95% CI: 42%, 52%) of the respondents had poor quality of life. Respondents who were in the middle age group (AOR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.70), lower educational level (AOR = 3.11, 95%CI: 1.35, 7.15), those who had low drug adherence (AOR = 8.36, 95%CI: (2.41, 28.98) comorbid anxiety, (AOR = 3.63, 95% CI: 2.55, 8.42) and depression (AOR = 3.85, 95% CI: 2.16, 6.82) were found to be significantly associated with poor quality of life of epilepsy patients.This study revealed that almost one in two epileptic patients had poor quality of life. Age of the respondents, lower educational level, comorbid anxiety and depression, and lower adherence to drugs were significantly associated with poor quality of life. Therefore, health institutions and clinicians should not focus only on the treatment of the disease itself rather they should address diseases' impact on the quality of life of patients."
https://openalex.org/W4210255861,"Video game companies are increasingly diversifying their profit models. Rather than relying exclusively on the sale of video game titles or the subscription model, video game companies are maximising the revenues and extending the lifecycle of their games by means of a strategy based on the sale of in-game goods. This study contributes to the theory on in-game goods purchases by explaining why and how video game players purchase different types of in-game goods. We used an inductive approach involving qualitative data analysis based on grounded theory. Six types of in-game goods are grouped into three categories: functional-based goods, probability-based goods, and ornamental-based goods. After acknowledging the heterogeneity of the categories, a conceptual framework is developed by conducting 21 in-depth interviews, from which it emerges that players purchase functional-based goods, probability-based goods, and ornamental-based goods for different motives and through the different behavioural processes. First, the purchase of functional-based goods is a strategy for entering the flow experience. Second, the purchase of probability-based goods is a compromise for purchase restrictions. Third, the purchase of ornamental goods is driven by the synergism of intrinsic motivations and exposure in the virtual world. Therefore, video game researchers should not treat in-game goods as a homogeneous concept. The findings also suggest that it is critically important for video game developers to strike a balance between the challenges of the gameplay and the skills of players because excessively raising (or lowering) the level of difficulty could pose a threat to the company's sustainable profit."
https://openalex.org/W3195064418,"Automated next-best action recommendation for each customer in a sequential, dynamic and interactive context has been widely needed in natural, social and business decision-making. Personalized next-best action recommendation must involve past, current and future customer demographics and circumstances (states) and behaviors, long-range sequential interactions between customers and decision-makers, multi-sequence interactions between states, behaviors and actions, and their reactions to their counterpart's actions. No existing modeling theories and tools, including Markovian decision processes, user and behavior modeling, deep sequential modeling, and personalized sequential recommendation, can quantify such complex decision-making on a personal level. We take a data-driven approach to learn the next-best actions for personalized decision-making by a reinforced coupled recurrent neural network (CRN). CRN represents multiple coupled dynamic sequences of a customer's historical and current states, responses to decision-makers' actions, decision rewards to actions, and learns long-term multi-sequence interactions between parties (customer and decision-maker). Next-best actions are then recommended on each customer at a time point to change their state for an optimal decision-making objective. Our study demonstrates the potential of personalized deep learning of multi-sequence interactions and automated dynamic intervention for personalized decision-making in complex systems."
https://openalex.org/W4210589168,"With the development of measurement technology, data on the movements of actual games in various sports can be obtained and used for planning and evaluating the tactics and strategy. Defense in team sports is generally difficult to be evaluated because of the lack of statistical data. Conventional evaluation methods based on predictions of scores are considered unreliable because they predict rare events throughout the game. Besides, it is difficult to evaluate various plays leading up to a score. In this study, we propose a method to evaluate team defense from a comprehensive perspective related to team performance by predicting ball recovery and being attacked, which occur more frequently than goals, using player actions and positional data of all players and the ball. Using data from 45 soccer matches, we examined the relationship between the proposed index and team performance in actual matches and throughout a season. Results show that the proposed classifiers predicted the true events (mean F1 score > 0.483) better than the existing classifiers which were based on rare events or goals (mean F1 score < 0.201). Also, the proposed index had a moderate correlation with the long-term outcomes of the season (r = 0.397). These results suggest that the proposed index might be a more reliable indicator rather than winning or losing with the inclusion of accidental factors."
https://openalex.org/W4210821071,"To investigate how cancer patients' and family members' perspective and health locus of control are presented in clinical encounter decision-making.Semi-structured in-depth interviews were carried out with 16 cancer patients and 6 family members living in Israel (n = 22). Interviews were transcribed verbatim, and data were analyzed using thematic analysis.Following the health locus of control model, the findings were divided into an external and internal locus of control themes, and we added a theme regarding shared decision-making. Internal locus of control sub-themes included asking for a second opinion, negotiating with the doctor, asking questions, looking for information, and fighting for their rights. External locus of control sub-themes included powerful others, oncologists, and fate. The dominant approach of most of the interviewees was an external locus of control. Women demonstrated more external locus of control than men. On the direct question of who should decide on treatment-the doctor, the patient, or both jointly-the answers ranged from only the doctor (n = 8) to together (n = 7) to only the patient (n = 8).This study provides insights into different aspects of locus of control in the clinical encounter involving cancer patients. The findings reflect the need to devote comprehensive attention to cancer patients' perceptions and experiences in the clinical encounter. A patient-centered care approach and a personalized framework for decision-making in cancer care are essential to achieving better treatment outcomes. Further research can engage in the development and validation of an up-to-date health locus of control questionnaire for cancer patients based on the findings of this study."
https://openalex.org/W4226281957,"Understanding how wildlife interacts with human activities across non-protected areas are critical for conservation. This is especially true for ungulates that inhabit human-dominated landscapes outside the protected area system in Nepal, where wildlife often coexists with livestock. Here we investigated how elevation, agricultural land, distance from roads, and the relative abundance of livestock (goats, sheep, cow and buffalo) influenced wild ungulate chital (Axis axis), nilgai (Boselaphustrago camelus), wild boar (Sus scrofa) and sambar (Rusa unicolor) abundance and occurrence. We counted all individuals of wild ungulates and livestock along 35 transects conducted between November 2017 and March 2018 in community forests of Bara and Rautahat distracts in the lowlands of Nepal. We assessed abundance and occurrence relation to covariates using Generalized Linear Models. We found that livestock outnumbered wild ungulates 6.6 to 1. Wild boar was the most abundant wild ungulate, followed by nilgai, chital, and sambar. Elevation and livestock abundance were the most important covariates affecting the overall abundance of wild ungulates and the distribution of each individual ungulate species. Our results suggest spatial segregation between wild ungulates, which occur mainly on high grounds (> 300 m.a.s.l.), and livestock that concentrate across low ground habitats (< 300 m.a.s.l.). Our results provide a critical first step to inform conservation in community forest areas of Nepal, where wildlife interacts with people and their livestock. Finding better strategies to allow the coexistence of ungulates with people and their livestock is imperative if they are to persist into the future."
https://openalex.org/W4210799352,"Age inappropriate vaccination of children increases the rate of mortality and morbidity. All studies conducted in some areas of Ethiopia were only quantitative in nature and focused on the main cities ignoring rural communities.The objective of this study is to assess vaccination timeliness and associated factors among children in Toke Kutaye district, central Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study with quantitative and qualitative data collection methods was used, for which simple random sampling was used to select 602 mothers/caregivers who have vaccinated children aged 12 to 23 months in the district. The collected data were entered into Epi-data version 3.1 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Bivariate analysis with a P-value of < 0.25 was used to select candidate variables for multivariate logistic regression. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% CI and p-value < 0.05 were used to declare a significant association. Qualitative data responses were classified and then organized by content with thematic analysis.A total of 590 respondents responded to the interviews, making a response rate of 98%. In this study, 23.9% (95% CI: 20.4-27.7) of children aged 12-23 months had received all vaccines in the recommended time intervals. Urban residence (AOR: 3.15, 95% CI: 1.56-6.4), participation of pregnant women in conferences (AOR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.2-4.57), institutional delivery (AOR: 2.5: 95% CI: 1.32-4.20), and sufficient knowledge of mothers (AOR: 3, 95% CI: 1.82-5.10) were significantly associated with the timeliness of childhood vaccination. Qualitative findings revealed that lack of knowledge and lack of information from mothers or caregivers, and inadequate communication with health workers hindered timely vaccination.The overall timeliness of the child's vaccination was low in this study. Residence, participation in a conference, place of delivery, and knowledge of the mothers were predictors of vaccination timeliness. Hence, promoting institutional delivery and increasing pregnant mothers awreness on vaccination timeliness through conference participation is compulsory."
https://openalex.org/W4210803619,"Wildfires significantly alter soil properties and result in vegetation shifts; therefore, rapid reforestation activities are needed in the forests affected by wildfires. The decreased nutrient in the soil is the obvious effect of wildfires; however, little is known about the reforestation of Juniper (Juniperus procera) forests with application of NPK fertilizers. Juniper forests are common in Asir and Taif regions of Saudi Arabia and vulnerable to wildfires; thus, reforestation is needed after the onset of fires. This study assessed the impact of different doses of organic NPK fertilizer (0, 5 and 10 g/L) on growth and nutrient accumulation of Juniper trees grown on fire-damaged and intact soils. Data relating to tree height, number of leaves per plant, fresh and dry biomass accumulation in shoot and root, chlorophyll contents and uptake of N, P, K, and Na were recorded. Individual and interactive effects of soil types and fertilizer doses significantly altered all measured traits with minor exceptions. Overall, higher values of the measured traits were recorded for intact soil and 10 g/L fertilize dose. The increasing fertilizer doses improved the growth and nutrient acquisition and application of 10 g/L fertilizer on intact soil recorded the highest values of growth traits. Juniper trees grown on fire-damaged soil accumulated higher amount of nitrogen than intact soil. Similarly, the trees grown on intact soil accumulated lower amount of Na and maintained comparable K/Na ratio to intact soil. It is concluded that supplying 10 g/L fertilizer could improve the establishment of Juniper trees on fire-damaged soil.

In our previous work, we showed that the size of the AB can be changed by applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) (London & Slagter, Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 33, 756-68, 2021). Although AB size at the group level remained unchanged, the effects of anodal and cathodal tDCS were negatively correlated: if a given individual's AB size decreased from baseline during anodal tDCS, their AB size would increase during cathodal tDCS, and vice versa. Here, we attempted to replicate this finding. We found no group effects of tDCS, as in the original study, but we no longer found a significant negative correlation. We present a series of statistical measures of replication success, all of which confirm that both studies are not in agreement. First, the correlation here is significantly smaller than a conservative estimate of the original correlation. Second, the difference between the correlations is greater than expected due to sampling error, and our data are more consistent with a zero-effect than with the original estimate. Finally, the overall effect when combining both studies is small and not significant. Our findings thus indicate that the effects of lDPLFC-tDCS on the AB are less substantial than observed in our initial study. Although this should be quite a common scenario, null findings can be difficult to interpret and are still under-represented in the brain stimulation and cognitive neuroscience literatures. An important auxiliary goal of this paper is therefore to provide a tutorial for other researchers, to maximize the evidential value from null findings."
https://openalex.org/W3091609634,"Although food and politics seem to be distant domains, socio-political ideology and food neophobia (i.e., reluctance to eat unfamiliar food) may be related. Conservatives' high threat sensitivity and the inherently threatening nature of novel foods (the existential explanation), along with conservatives' negative attitudes toward minority outgroups (e.g., foreigners) and the role of the latter in introducing novel foods to a culture (the social explanation), led us to expect that socio-political ideology would predict food neophobia over and above their common roots. Across two correlational and two experimental studies (N = 627), socio-political ideology emerged as a strong predictor of food neophobia. In addition, the findings did not support the existential explanation, while confirming the social explanation of the ideology-food neophobia link: Conservatives seem more neophobic than liberals not because of their higher threat sensitivity but rather because they hold more negative attitudes toward foreigners who are associated with those foods."
https://openalex.org/W4210286451,"It is often claimed that languages with more non-native speakers tend to become morphologically simpler, presumably because non-native speakers learn the language imperfectly. A growing number of studies support this claim, but there is a dearth of experiments that evaluate it and the suggested explanatory mechanisms. We performed a large-scale experiment which directly tested whether imperfect language learning simplifies linguistic structure and whether this effect is amplified by iterated learning. Members of 45 transmission chains, each consisting of 10 one-person generations, learned artificial mini-languages and transmitted them to the next generation. Manipulating the learning time showed that when transmission chains contained generations of imperfect learners, the decrease in morphological complexity was more pronounced than when the chains did not contain imperfect learners. The decrease was partial (complexity did not get fully eliminated) and gradual (caused by the accumulation of small simplifying changes). Simplification primarily affected double agent-marking, which is more redundant, arguably more difficult to learn and less salient than other features. The results were not affected by the number of the imperfect-learner generations in the transmission chains. Thus, we provide strong experimental evidence in support of the hypothesis that iterated imperfect learning leads to language simplification."

For this, we applied the Connectivity Map (CMap) bioinformatic resource to identify drugs that generate, in the CMap database, gene expression profiles (GEP) that negatively correlate with a SARS-COV-2 GEP, anticipating that these drugs could antagonize the deleterious effects of the virus at cell, tissue or organism levels. We identified several anti-cancer compounds that target MDM2 in the p53 pathway or signaling proteins: Ras, PKBβ, Nitric Oxide synthase, Rho kinase, all involved in the transmission of proliferative and growth signals. We hypothesized that these drugs could interfere with the high rate of biomass synthesis in infected cells, a feature shared with cancer cells. Other compounds including etomoxir, triacsin-c, PTB1-IN-3, are known to modulate lipid metabolism or to favor catabolic reactions by activating AMPK. Four different anti-inflammatory molecules, including dexamethasone, fluorometholone and cytosporone-b, targeting the glucocorticoid receptor, cyclooxygenase, or NUR77 also came out of the analysis. These results represent a first step in the characterization of potential repositioning strategies to treat SARS-COV-2."
https://openalex.org/W4210607739,"Background Hypertension is a devastating global public health challenge; studies indicated that Ethiopia has been affected by the burden of hypertension especially in urban areas. The overall prevalence of hypertension in Ethiopia was estimated to be 19.6% (23.5% in urban and 14.7% in rural population). Along with medical management of hypertension, appropriate lifestyle modification is a crucial and inexpensive means of hypertension control. The main purpose of the study was therefore to assess knowledge, attitude and practice of lifestyle modification among patients on follow up for hypertension treatment at Yekatit 12 General Hospital. Methods A prospective cross-sectional study design was applied in Yekatit 12 General Hospital from October 28, 2018, to February 28, 2019, by allotting proportionate samples from the two chronic outpatients departments (OPD). Using single proportion sampling techniques, the study participants were selected and the total sample size calculated was 405. Primarily, clinical measurements were made according to the international standard set to verify true hypertensive patient’s inclusions. Then, data about socio-demographic characteristics, lifestyle modification related to knowledge, attitude and practices were comprehensively collected using an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire. The collected data was entered into Epi-data exported to SPSS Window version of 22 for analysis. All variables with ρ-value less than 0.05 in the final model were considered as independently associated with knowledge, attitude and practices of patients’ lifestyle modification. The strength of association was described by Odds Ratio (OR) at the corresponding CI of 95%. Results The overall sampled hypertensive patients as compared to the planned sample size was 95.5% (n = 387), out of which 53.5% (n = 207) was male patients. The mean age was 50 years with a standard deviation of 14.4. The study revealed that 67.7% [95% CI (65.32%, 70.08%)] were knowledgeable; and 54.0% [95% CI (51.34%, 56.6%)] were reported to have favorable attitude towards lifestyle modification. Regarding their practices, 38% [95% CI (19.91%, 57.49%] of the respondents had good practices. Their monthly income [AOR = 2.39, 95% CI (1.12, 5.11)] and duration on-treatment follow up since diagnosed with hypertension [AOR = 4.39, 95% CI (1.20, 16.03)] were independently associated with knowledge. Concerning their damned practices, age [AOR = 7.71, 95% CI (2.4, 24.8)] and knowledge [AOR = 3.94, 95% CI (2.01, 7.72)] were independently associated with the practices. Conclusion Though the encouraging high knowledge status and favourable attitudes towards lifestyle modification among hypertensive patients, the practices are among the lowest findings report in all standards. Hence, older patients, jobless patients, and low-income patients and patients on long-term treatment follow up who were diagnosed with hypertension before 10 years needs special attention and interventions by the country NCDs policy formulators to rise their non-pharmacological practices to control high blood pressure and its consequences."
https://openalex.org/W4210726198,"Chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) is a highly debilitating and recalcitrant disease with limited treatment options. Although various stem cell types have shown some clinical efficacy for injury repair they have not for SCI. Hair-follicle-associated pluripotent (HAP) stem cells have been shown to differentiate into neurons, Schwan cells, beating cardiomyocytes and many other type of cells, and have effectively regenerated acute spinal cord injury in mouse models. In the present report, HAP stem cells from C57BL/6J mice, encapsulated in polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (PFM), were implanted into the severed thoracic spinal cord of C57BL/6J or athymic nude mice in the early chronic phase. After implantation, HAP stem cells differentiated to neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes in the regenerated thoracic spinal cord of C57BL/6J and nude mice. Quantitative motor function analysis, with the Basso Mouse Scale for Locomotion (BMS) score, demonstrated a significant functional improvement in the HAP-stem-cell-implanted mice, compared to non-implanted mice. HAP stem cells have critical advantages over other stem cells: they do not develop teratomas; do not loose differentiation ability when cryopreserved and thus are bankable; are autologous, readily obtained from anyone; and do not require genetic manipulation. HAP stem cells therefore have greater clinical potential for SCI repair than induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), neuronal stem cells (NSCs)/neural progenitor cells (NPCs) or embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The present report demonstrates future clinical potential of HAP-stem-cell repair of chronic spinal cord injury, currently a recalcitrant disease."
https://openalex.org/W4210388133,"This study proposes SVM based Random Subspace (RS) ensemble classifier to discriminate different Power Quality Events (PQEs) in a photovoltaic (PV) connected Microgrid (MG) model. The MG model is developed and simulated with the presence of different PQEs (voltage and harmonic related signals and distinctive transients) in both on-grid and off-grid modes of MG network, respectively. In the pre-stage of classification, the features are extracted from numerous PQE signals by Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) analysis, and the extracted features are used to learn the classifiers at the final stage. In this study, first three Kernel types of SVM classifiers (Linear, Quadratic, and Cubic) are used to predict the different PQEs. Among the results that Cubic kernel SVM classifier offers higher accuracy and better performance than other kernel types (Linear and Quadradic). Further, to enhance the accuracy of SVM classifiers, a SVM based RS ensemble model is proposed and its effectiveness is verified with the results of kernel based SVM classifiers under the standard test condition (STC) and varying solar irradiance of PV in real time. From the final results, it can be concluded that the proposed method is more robust and offers superior performance with higher accuracy of classification than kernel based SVM classifiers."
https://openalex.org/W4210440968,"Identifying genes with the largest expression changes (gene selection) to characterize a given condition is a popular first step to drive exploration into molecular mechanisms and is, therefore, paramount for therapeutic development. Reproducibility in the sciences makes it necessary to emphasize objectivity and systematic repeatability in biological and informatics analyses, including gene selection. With these two characteristics in mind, in previous works our research team has proposed using multiple criteria optimization (MCO) in gene selection to analyze microarray datasets. The result of this effort is the MCO algorithm, which selects genes with the largest expression changes without user manipulation of neither informatics nor statistical parameters. Furthermore, the user is not required to choose either a preference structure among multiple measures or a predetermined quantity of genes to be deemed significant a priori. This implies that using the same datasets and performance measures (PMs), the method will converge to the same set of selected differentially expressed genes (repeatability) despite who carries out the analysis (objectivity). The present work describes the development of an open-source tool in RStudio to enable both: (1) individual analysis of single datasets with two or three PMs and (2) meta-analysis with up to five microarray datasets, using one PM from each dataset. The capabilities afforded by the code include license-free portability and the possibility to carry out analyses via modest computer hardware, such as personal laptops. The code provides affordable, repeatable, and objective detection of differentially expressed genes from microarrays. It can be used to analyze other experiments with similar experimental comparative layouts, such as microRNA arrays and protein arrays, among others. As a demonstration of the capabilities of the code, the analysis of four publicly-available microarray datasets related to Parkinson´s Disease (PD) is presented here, treating each dataset individually or as a four-way meta-analysis. These MCO-supported analyses made it possible to identify MMP9 and TUBB2A as potential PD genetic biomarkers based on their persistent appearance across each of the case studies. A literature search confirmed the importance of these genes in PD and indeed as PD biomarkers, which evidences the code´s potential."
https://openalex.org/W4210526691,"Robotic assisted gait training (RAGT) uses a powered exoskeleton to support an individual's body and move their limbs, with the aim of activating latent, pre-existing movement patterns stored in the lower spinal cord called central pattern generators (CPGs) to facilitate stepping. The parameters that directly stimulate the stepping CPGs (hip extension and ipsilateral foot unloading) should be targeted to maximise the rehabilitation benefits of these devices.To compare the biomechanical profiles of individuals with a spinal cord injury (SCI) and able-bodied individuals inside the ReWalkTM powered exoskeleton and to contrast the users' profiles with the exoskeleton.Eight able-bodied and four SCI individuals donned a ReWalkTM and walked along a 12-meter walkway, using elbow crutches. Whole-body kinematics of the users and the ReWalkTM were captured, along with GRF and temporal-spatial characteristics. Discreet kinematic values were analysed using a Kruskall-Wallis H and Dunn's post-hoc analysis. Upper-body differences, GRF and temporal-spatial characteristics were analysed using a Mann-Whitney U test (P<0.05).Walking speed ranged from 0.32-0.39m/s. Hip abduction, peak knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion for both the SCI and able-bodied groups presented with significant differences to the ReWalkTM. The able-bodied group presented significant differences to the ReWalkTM for all kinematic variables except frontal plane hip ROM (P = 0.093,δ = -0.56). Sagittal plane pelvic and trunk ROM were significantly greater in the SCI vs. able-bodied (P = 0.004,δ = -1; P = 0.008,δ = -0.94, respectively). Posterior braking force was significantly greater in the SCI group (P = 0.004, δ = -1).The different trunk movements used by the SCI group and the capacity for the users' joint angles to exceed those of the device suggest that biomechanical profiles varied according to the user group. However, upright stepping with the ReWalkTM device delivered the appropriate afferent stimulus to activate CPGs as there were no differences in key biomechanical parameters between the two user groups."
https://openalex.org/W4210776819,"Aim Serum adiponectin levels are decreased in patients with cerebral infarction. Adiponectin in circulation exists in three isoforms: high molecular weight (HMW), medium molecular weight (MMW), and low molecular weight (LMW) adiponectin. We measured serum levels of total adiponectin and adiponectin multimers (HMW, MMW, and LMW) in patients with cerebral infarction and compared the serum levels of the three adiponectin multimers in stroke subtypes. We also evaluated the clinical value of adiponectin multimer levels as a biomarker for cerebral infarction. Methods We assessed a total of 132 patients with cerebral infarctions. The serum levels of total and adiponectin multimers were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results The total and HMW adiponectin levels were significantly lower in atherothrombotic infarction (AI) than in cerebral embolism (CE) (total, p &lt; 0.05; HMW, p &lt; 0.05). In male patients, the MMW adiponectin level was significantly lower in the lacunar infarction (LI) group than in the AI group ( p &lt; 0.05). The LMW adiponectin level was significantly lower in the AI group than in the LI and CE groups (LI, p &lt; 0.001; CE, p = 0.001). However, there were no significant differences in adiponectin multimer levels among the stroke subtypes in female subjects. Additionally, in female patients with AI and LI, the LMW adiponectin levels were negatively associated with C-reactive protein (CRP; AI, p &lt; 0.05; LI, p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion These findings suggest that a decrease in adiponectin is associated with AI and that serum LMW adiponectin level represents a potential biomarker for AI."
https://openalex.org/W4210813539,"Bangladesh achieved the fourth Millennium Development Goal well ahead of schedule, with a significant reduction in under-5 mortality between 1990 and 2015. However, the reduction in neonatal mortality has been stagnant in recent years. The purpose of this study is to explore the association between place of delivery and newborn care with early neonatal mortality (ENNM), which represents more than 80% of total neonatal mortality in Bangladesh.In this study, 2014 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey data were used to assess early neonatal survival in children born in the three years preceding the survey. The roles of place of the delivery and newborn care in ENNM were examined using multivariable logistic regression models adjusted for clustering and relevant socio-economic, pregnancy, and newborn characteristics.Between 2012 and 2014, there were 4,624 deliveries in 17,863 sampled households, 39% of which were delivered at health facilities. The estimated early neonatal mortality rate during this period was 15 deaths per 1,000 live births. We found that newborns who had received at least 3 components of essential newborn care (ENC) were 56% less likely to die during the first seven days of their lives compared to their counterparts who received 0-2 components of ENC (aOR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.24-0.81). In addition, newborns who had received any postnatal care (PNC) were 68% less likely to die in the early neonatal period than those who had not received any PNC (aOR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.16-0.64). Facility delivery was not significantly associated with the risk of early newborn death in any of the models.Our study findings highlight the importance of newborn and postnatal care in preventing early neonatal deaths. Further, findings suggest that increasing the proportion of women who give birth in a healthcare facility is not sufficient to reduce ENNM by itself; to realize the theoretical potential of facility delivery to avert neonatal deaths, we must also ensure quality of care during delivery, guarantee all components of ENC, and provide high-quality early PNC. Therefore, sustained efforts to expand access to high-quality ENC and PNC are needed in health facilities, particularly in facilities serving low-income populations."
https://openalex.org/W4213018580,"In low- and middle-income countries, poor autonomy prevents women from making financial decisions, which may impact their access to improved sanitation facilities. Inadequate access to improved sanitation disproportionately affects women’s and children’s health and wellbeing. Although socio-cultural factors are known contributors to gender inequity, social beliefs that potentially motivate or dissuade women from making sanitation-related household decisions are not well understood. These beliefs may vary across settlement types. To empower more women to make sanitation-related decisions, the relevant socio-cultural norms and underlying social beliefs need to be addressed. In this mixed methods study, we explored women’s role in sanitation-related decision making in three settlement types, urban slums, peri-urban, and rural communities in Bihar. Trained qualitative researchers conducted six focus group discussions with women of two age groups: 18–30 years old, and 45–65 years old to understand the norm-focused factors around women’s role in getting a toilet for their household. Using insights generated from these group discussions, we developed and conducted a theory-driven survey in 2528 randomly selected participants, to assess the social beliefs regarding women making toilet construction decisions in these communities. Overall, 45% of the respondents reported making joint decisions to build toilets that involved both men and women household members. More women exclusively led this decision-making process in peri-urban (26%) and rural areas (35%) compared to urban slums (12%). Social beliefs that men commonly led household decisions to build toilets were negatively associated with women’s participation in decision making in urban slums (adjusted prevalence ratio, aPR: 0.53, 95% CI: 0.42, 0.68). Qualitative insights highlighted normative expectations to take joint decisions with elders, especially in joint family settings. Surrounding norms that limited women’s physical mobility and access to peers undermined their confidence in making large financial decisions involved in toilet construction. Women were more likely to be involved in sanitation decisions in peri-urban and rural contexts. Women’s involvement in such decisions was perceived as widely acceptable. This highlights the opportunity to increase women’s participation in sanitation decision making, particularly in urban contexts. As more women get involved in decisions to build toilets, highlighting this norm may encourage gender-equitable engagement in sanitation-related decisions in low-resource settings."
https://openalex.org/W4210273483,"Diet and exercise can alter the gut microbiota, but recent studies have assessed the impact of athletic competition on gut microbiota and host metabolites. We designed an open-label pilot study to investigate the effects of both official competition and a multi-strain lactic acid bacteria-fermented soymilk extract (LEX) on the gut microbiota in Japanese college endurance athletes. The analysis of fecal 16S rRNA metagenome and urinary metabolites was used to identify changes in gut microbiota composition and host metabolism. When the fecal microbiota were investigated before and after a race without using of a supplement (pre-observation period), there was an increase in the phylum Firmicutes and decrease in Bacteroidetes . However, no changes in these phyla were seen before and after a race in those who consumed LEX. Before and after LEX ingestion, changes in urinary metabolites included a significant reduction in yeast and fungal markers, neurotransmitters, and mitochondrial metabolites including the TCA cycle. There were several correlations between urinary metabolites and the composition of fecal microbiota. For example, the level of tricarballylic acid was positively correlated with the composition ratio of phylum Firmicutes (Pearson’s r = 0.66; p &lt; 0.01). The bacterial species Parabacteroides distasonis was also found to correlate moderately with several urinary metabolites. These findings suggest two possibilities. First, endurance athletes experience significant fluctuations in gut microbiota after a single competition. Second, LEX ingestion may improve yeast and fungal overgrowth in the gastrointestinal tract and enhancing mitochondrial metabolic function."
https://openalex.org/W4210357236,"The European native, noble crayfish (Astacus astacus) has suffered from a serious and long term population decline due to habitat destruction, water pollution and the impact of the invasive North American crayfish that are carriers of the crayfish plague (Aphanomyces astaci). The latter being the major factor currently confining noble crayfish to uninvaded (parts of) waterbodies. However, recently wild populations of apparently healthy noble crayfish carrying the crayfish plague have been found. As crayfish are known for their inter- and intraspecific agonistic behaviour which may be key for their competitive success, this raised the interesting question what would happen if the crayfish plague would not be a dominant factor anymore in the interaction between native and invasive species. Since the outcome of those encounters is still unclear, this study explores whether the noble crayfish can stand its ground towards invasive species in such agonistic interactions. Furthermore, the ability of the noble crayfish and invasive crayfish to acquire shelter through agonistic interaction is also assessed. Through pairwise staged interactions, agonistic behaviour and shelter competition between the native A. astacus and the invasive Faxonius limosus and Procambarus acutus were examined. The results showed that A. astacus triumphs over F. limosus and P. acutus in agonistic encounters and in competition for shelter. In turn, P. acutus dominates F. limosus in staged encounters and shelter. In possible future situations were crayfish plague does no longer eradicate noble crayfish populations, our results show that the native noble crayfish might still have a promising future when confronted with invasive species."
https://openalex.org/W4210488208,"Copper is a common component in wood preservatives and is used to protect the wood against fungal degradation. Previous research has shown that the Cu++ oxidation state provides the best wood protection, and Cu++ is widely believed to be the oxidation state of most copper within treated wood. A recent study using X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) reported high amounts of Cu+ in wood that had been in contact with corroded fasteners. This study uses XANES to examine the copper oxidation states in wood treated with several different wood preservatives as a function of time after treatment. In contrast with previous literature which focused on the fixation reaction in the first few hours after treatment, this paper examines the oxidation state of Cu in treated wood at longer times (up to 1-year) after treatment. The results showed in nearly all cases, Cu was in the Cu++ oxidation state to within the measurement uncertainty. Cu XANES patterns taken approximately 1-year after treatment showed no discernable differences between preservative systems, indicating that regardless of the starting treatment the final Cu speciation is the same within one year. The results confirm previously held beliefs about the Cu oxidation states in wood and give further insights into the corrosion mechanism of metals embedded in treated wood."

However, the clinical efficacy has been variable and a search for cure for COVID-19 continues. A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 916 patients hospitalized with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 between February 2020 and October 2020 at a tertiary care academic medical center in Karachi, Pakistan. The median age was 57 years (interquartile range (IQR) 46-66 years). The most common medications administered were Methylprednisolone (65.83%), Azithromycin (50.66%), and Dexamethasone (46.6%). Majority of the patients (70%) had at least two or more medications used in combination and the most frequent combination was methylprednisolone with azithromycin. Overall in-hospital mortality was 13.65% of patients. Mortality was found to be independently associated with age greater than or equal to 60 years (OR = 4.98; 95%CI: 2.78-8.91), critical illness on admission (OR = 13.75; 95%CI: 7.27-25.99), use of hydrocortisone (OR = 12.56; 95%CI: 6.93-22.7), Ferritin> = 1500(OR = 2.07; 95%CI: 1.18-3.62), Creatinine(OR = 2.33; 95%CI: 1.31-4.14) and D-Dimer> = 1.5 (OR = 2.27; 95%CI: 1.26-4.07). None of the medications whether used as monotherapy or in combination were found to have a mortality benefit. Our study highlights the desperate need for an effective drug for the management of critical COVID-19 which necessitates usage of multiple drug combinations in patients particularly Azithromycin which has long term implications for antibiotic resistance particularly in low-middle income countries."
https://openalex.org/W4210800216,"Malnutrition during pregnancy is associated with increased maternal morbidity and mortality and has a long-term negative impact on child growth and development. Antenatal care (ANC) is the formal point of contact for pregnant women to receive preventive health and nutrition services. We assessed the quality of nutrition service delivery during ANC and examined its influencing factors related to the health facility, health care provider (HCP) and client characteristics. We conducted a cross-sectional assessment in 179 facilities, including 1,242 ANC observations and exit interviews of pregnant women from 21 districts in Bangladesh. We considered four essential nutrition services at each ANC contact including maternal weight measurement, anaemia assessment, nutrition counselling and iron-folic acid (IFA) supplement provision. We defined a composite 'quality nutrition service' outcome by counting the number of services (out of four) provided at each ANC from observation data. We explored both the supply-side and the client-level factors of quality nutrition service using multilevel Poisson regression. Overall, only 15% of clients received all four nutrition services. Performance of weight measurement (79%) was higher than IFA provision (56%), anaemia assessment (52%) and nutrition counselling (52%). The multivariable analysis showed that quality nutrition service delivery is positively associated with good logistical readiness of the facilities (aIRR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.08-1.39), consultation by paramedics (aIRR 1.23, 95% CI: 1.06-1.42) and community health care providers (aIRR 1.32, 95% CI: 1.12-1.57), HCPs' knowledge on maternal nutrition (aIRR 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.08), better HCP-client communication (aIRR 1.14; 95% CI: 1.04-1.26) and use visual aids or ANC card (aIRR 1.18; 95% CI: 1.11-1.27). We found limited associations between HCP training and external supervision with the quality of nutrition services. In conclusion, the quality of nutrition service provision during ANC is suboptimal. Public health nutrition programmers should ensure the facilities' logistical readiness, and revisit and reinforce the content and modality of training and supportive supervision of the HCPs. They should also emphasize positive HCP-client communication and the use of job aids to improve the quality of nutrition service provision during ANC."

https://openalex.org/W4210333949,"Cellular senescence is accompanied by metabolic and epigenomic remodeling, but the transcriptional mechanism of this process is unclear. Our previous RNA interference-based screen of chromatin factors found that lysine methyltransferases including SETD8 and NSD2 inhibited the senescence program in cultured fibroblasts. Here, we report that loss of the zinc finger and homeobox protein 3 (ZHX3), a ubiquitously expressed transcription repressor, induced senescence-associated gene expression and mitochondrial-nucleolar activation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analyses of growing cells revealed that ZHX3 was enriched at the transcription start sites of senescence-associated genes such as the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (ARF-p16INK4a) gene and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) coding genes. ZHX3 expression was consistently downregulated in cells with replicative or oncogene-induced senescence. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics identified 28 proteins that interacted with ZHX3, including ATP citrate lyase and RNA metabolism proteins. Loss of ZHX3 or ZHX3-interaction partners by knockdown similarly induced the expression of p16INK4a and rRNA genes. Zhx3-knockout mice showed upregulation of p16INK4a in the testes, thymus and skeletal muscle tissues, together with relatively short survival periods in males. These data suggested that ZHX3 plays an essential role in transcriptional control to prevent cellular senescence."

All patients with presumptive TB submitted a sputum sample for microbiological TB testing. Patients who reported a prior history of TB treatment were included in the present analysis. 'Confirmed TB' was defined by the detection of TB using Xpert Ultra and/or liquid culture, while 'possible TB' was defined by the receipt of TB treatment without a positive Xpert Ultra or culture result. We evaluated the positive predictive value (PPV) of clinical symptoms and radiographic features for active TB alone and in combination.Of 740 presumptive TB patients, 144 (19%) had been previously treated for active TB. Of these, 19 (13%) patients had confirmed TB, 14 (10%) had possible TB, and 111 (77%) had no pulmonary TB. Overall, 119 (83%) patients had ≥1 current respiratory symptom-this did not differ according to current TB disease classification (95%, 93%, 79%; p = 0.23). Sixty-one patients (56%) had radiographic abnormalities suggestive of active TB and such findings were more common among patients with confirmed or possible TB compared to those without TB (93%, 71%, vs. 47%; p = 0.002). Most patients (n = 91, 83%) had at least one radiographic abnormality-no difference by current TB classification was observed (93%, 100%, 79%; p = 0.08). The PPV of any current respiratory symptom, active TB radiographic finding, or any radiographic abnormality for TB was 13% (95%CI: 7-21%), 21% (95%CI: 12-34) and 14% (95%CI: 9-23), respectively; combining clinical and radiographic characteristics did not significantly improve the PPV for active TB.Among presumptive TB patients previously treated for TB, respiratory symptoms and radiographic abnormalities were common and poorly differentiated those with current active TB from those without current active TB. Reliance on clinical and radiographic characteristics alone in this patient population may result in substantial overtreatment and therefore, microbiological investigations should be used to inform TB treatment decisions whenever possible."
https://openalex.org/W4210579065,"Thrombolytic therapy in the treatment of cardiogenic acute cerebral embolism caused by coagulated blood carries the risk of hemorrhagic complications, and there is a need to develop safer and more reliable treatment methods. Laser thrombolysis therapy, which utilizes the difference in energy absorption between the thrombus and the arterial wall, has shown promise as a new treatment method because it can selectively act only on the thrombus. It has not been applied clinically, however, and one of the main reasons for this is that its underlying mechanism has not been elucidated. We developed a pulse laser thrombolysis system for treating cerebral blood vessels that consists of a diode-pumped solid-state neodymium-yttrium aluminum garnet laser, which has excellent stability and maintainability and is suitable for clinical applications coupled to a small-diameter optical fiber. Moreover, we analyzed the mechanisms that occur during pulsed laser irradiation of transparent glass tubes and gelatin phantoms. We found that bubbles form as a thermal effect in addition to ablation of the pulsed laser irradiation. Furthermore, we detected no shock waves or water jets associated with the bubbles. We analyzed the bubbles' dynamics and growth rate, and their effect on a rabbit blood clot phantom. We concluded that the bubbles generated by the laser irradiation physically cut the thrombus and thereby had a thrombectomy effect. We believe that this study will clarify the mechanism of laser thrombolysis therapy and contribute greatly to the realization of its clinical application."
https://openalex.org/W4210653691,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients usually achieve a complete response after treatment. This study was aimed to assess the clinical outcome of HCC patients who had achieved a complete response but later presented with elevated tumor marker levels without an identifiable recurrent tumor on gadoxetic acid-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcome of 58 HCC treated patients who had achieved a complete response but later was referred to our institution's multidisciplinary tumor board for a clinically suspected hidden HCC recurrence based on elevated tumor marker levels but negative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI. The imaging studies, tumor markers, and clinical information were reviewed. The total follow-up period was at least 15 months after the initial negative gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI.Follow-up imaging studies detected an HCC lesion in 89.7% (n = 52/58) of the patients within the study period, and approximately half of the tumors (46.2%, n = 24/52) developed within 3 months. The most frequent site of recurrence was the liver (86.5%; n = 45/52), but extra-hepatic metastasis was also common (19.2%; n = 10/52). In 5.8% (n = 3/52), HCC reoccurred in the combined form of intra-hepatic and extra-hepatic recurrence. Extra-hepatic metastasis alone occurred in 13.5% (n = 7/52) of patients.HCC frequently recurred within a short interval in patients who achieved a complete response to treatment in the presence of increased tumor marker levels, even if gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI was negative. Under such circumstances, we suggest a short-term follow-up including, but not limited to, gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI along with systemic evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W4210681309,"Intravenous vesicants are commonly infused via peripheral intravenous catheters (PIVC) despite guidelines recommending administration via central route. The impact of these medications on PIVC failure is unclear. We aimed to assess dose-related impact of these caustic medications on ultrasound-guided (US) PIVC survivorship.We performed a secondary analysis of a randomized control trial that compared survival of two catheters: a standard long (SL) and an ultra-long (UL) US PIVC. This study involved reviewing and recording all vesicants infusions through the PIVCs. Type and number of vesicants doses were extracted and characterized as one, two or multiple. The most commonly used vesicants were individually categorized for further analysis. The primary outcome was PIVC failure accounting for use and timing of vesicant infusates.Between October 2018 and March 2019, 257 subjects were randomized with 131 in the UL group and 126 in the SL group. Vesicants were infused in 96 (37.4%) out of 257 study participants. In multivariable time-dependent extended Cox regression analysis, there was no significant increased risk of failure due to vesicant use [adjusted hazard ratio, aHR 1.71 (95% CI 0.76-1.81) p = 0.477]. The number of vesicant doses was not significantly associated with the increased risk of PIVC failure [(1 vs 0) aHR 1.20 (95% CI 0.71-2.02) p = 0.500], [(2 vs 0) aHR 1.51 (95% CI 0.67-3.43) p = 0.320] and [(≥ 3 vs 0) aHR 0.98 (95% CI 0.50-1.92) p = 0.952].Vesicant usage did not significantly increase the risk of PIVC failure even when multiple doses were needed in this investigation. Ultrasound-guided PIVCs represent a pragmatic option when vesicant therapy is anticipated. Nevertheless, it is notable that overall PIVC failure rates remain high and other safety events related to vesicant use should be considered when clinicians make vascular access decisions for patients."
https://openalex.org/W4210687019,"Although Opisthorchis viverrini (OV), lifestyle, and diet co-factors have a relatively high prevalence in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) population, cumulative (0-74) incidence rates of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) do not reach 5% in this region. Other co-factors must influence, but in this study, we only highlighted positive factors for guiding joint planning to address public health problems at the regional level. Therefore, we aimed to study prevalence and factors associated with CCA incidence focusing only on protective factors. A cross-sectional analytic study was carried out from June to October 2017. Participants with informed consent completed the questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze general information. Primary variables were classified into high and low levels by mean. Logistic regression was employed to investigate the correlation between interesting variables and the overall risk level of CCA. The overall prevalence of CCA protective factors of the whole region was knowledge (61.39%), health beliefs (42.32%), prevention behavior (31.93%), and community participation (14.53%). When considering the proportions at a high level, they were 49.53%, 53.72%, 35.37%, and 49.67%, respectively. Significant factors associated with CCA prevention were females with secondary or vocational education, a high level of perceived seriousness and benefits, and community participation. These findings are likely to be helpful for both the public and administrators. First, it can be information for people to be aware of CCA risk. Second, policy-driven authorities at the local or regional level should apply the critical issues from this study for joint planning to sustainably solve regional public health problems."
https://openalex.org/W4210692636,"This study aimed to report the effects of different doses of ionizing radiation on inflammatory and repair stage of human skin graft adherence in Nude mice wounds. Animals were divided into transplanted with irradiated human skin grafts (IHSG) at 25 and 50 kGy (IHSG 25 kGy; IHSG 50 kGy) and non-IHSG and euthanized on the 3rd, 7th and 21st days after the surgery, by gross and microscopic changes, immunostaining for human type I collagen (Col I) and mouse Col I and Col III and inflammatory cells. We found an effectiveness of human split-thickness graft adherence in mice transplanted with IHSG 25 kGy, as well decrease in dermo-epidermal necrosis and neutrophils, lower loss of skin thickness, epithelization and neo-vascularization. Day 21 post-transplantation with IHSG 25 kGy was observed a well-preserved human skin in the border of the graft, a prominent granulation tissue in an organization by proliferated fibroblasts, Col III deposition and increased B-cells and macrophages. A complete adherence of human skin graft occurred with IHSG 25 kGy. We suggest that the ionizing radiation at 25 kGy mediates inflammation and the repair stage of human skin graft adherence in murine model, thus emerging as a potential tool in healing cutaneous wounds."

Injuries and deaths due to motorcycles are increasing, especially in developing countries. Wearing helmet is effective in reducing deaths and injuries caused by motorcycle accidents.To assess the magnitude of helmet wearing behavior and its determinants among motorcycle riders in Sawula and Bulky towns, Gofa zone, Southern Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from April, 15 to May 25, 2020, among 422 motorcycle drivers in Sawula and Bulky towns, where people often drive motorcycles. A stratified sampling technique was used to recruit sampled drivers in a face-to-face interview. Data were entered into EPI-data version 3.1 software and exported to SPSS version 23 software to manage analysis. Descriptive analyses such as frequency, percentage, mean and standard deviation were performed as necessary. Logistic regression models were fitted to identify the predictors of helmet wearing behavior. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to determine the magnitude and strength of the association.A total of 403 motorcycle drivers participated in the study which gave a 95.5% response rate. Among 403 motorcycle riders, only 12.4% (95% CI, 9.2 to 15.6%) wore helmets while driving motorcycles. Having license [AOR 3.51(95% C.I 1.56-7.89)], driving distance >10Km [AOR 2.53(95% C.I 1.08-5.91)], History of exposure to accident [AOR 2.71(95% C.I 1.32-5.55)], driving experience of ≥10 years [AOR 2.98 (95% C.I 1.25-7.09)] and high perceived susceptibility to accident [AOR 3.10(95% C.I 1.29-7.46)] had statistically significant association with helmet wearing compared to their counterparts.This study found that helmet-wearing behavior was very low. Having a license, driving distance, exposure to accidents, driving experience, and accident risk perception were determinants of helmet wearing behavior. These determinants imply the need for interventions that focus on behavioral change communications such as awareness creation campaigns and mandatory helmet wearing laws."
https://openalex.org/W3108356723,"Operative parameters of La Fuenfría Hospital such as: hospitalized patients; daily admissions and discharges were studies for the hospital as a whole, and for each hospital’s service unit (henceforth called ‘ services ’). Conventional statistical analyzes and fractal dimension analyzes were performed on daily In-Patient series. The sequence of daily admissions and patients staying on each service were found to be a kind of random series known as random walks ( Rw ), sequences where what happens next, depends on what happens now plus a random variable. Rw analyzed with parametric or nonparametric statistics may simulate cycles and drifts which resemble seasonal variations or fake trends which reduce the Hospital’s efficiency. Globally, inpatients Rw s in LFH, were found to be determined by the time elapsed between daily discharges and admissions. The factors determining LFH R were found to be the difference between daily admissions and discharges. The discharges are replaced by admissions with some random delay and the random difference determines LFH Rw s. These findings show that if the daily difference between admissions and discharges is minimized, the number of inpatients would fluctuate less and the number of unoccupied beds would be reduced, thus optimizing the Hospital service."

Outcome assessments were obtained at baseline, 2- and 3-month follow-up.The lifestyle intervention resulted in significantly greater improvements in lift and carry performance (p = 0.01) at 2 Months (d = 1.01; p < 0.01) and 3 Months (d = 0.95; p < 0.01) and superior improvements in mobility-related self-efficacy at 2 Months (d = 0.38) and 3 Months (d = 0.58) relative to standard-of-care. Mobility-related self-efficacy (r = -.66; p = 0.006) and satisfaction with function (r = -.63; p = 0.01) were significantly correlated with lift and carry performance at 3 Months.The exercise and dietary lifestyle intervention yielded superior improvements in lift and carry performance and mobility-related self-efficacy relative to standard-of-care and key social cognitive outcomes were associated with more favorable mobility performance."
https://openalex.org/W4210759469,"The tendency of persons with hemiplegia to sit for prolonged periods can cause excessive interface pressure (IP) on their buttocks. Due to the different neuromusculoskeletal conditions, different buttock IP relief methods are required for persons with left hemiplegia (LH) and right hemiplegia (RH). Therefore, this study investigates temporal characteristics of IP on the right and left buttocks for RH, LH, and able-bodied individuals (AB) sitting in a wheelchair for 30 min. Thirty-five males participated in the study: 13 LH, 12 RH, and 10 AB. In the initial adjustment phase, the participants maintained an erect sitting posture for 7 min (2 min for posture and 5 min for creep adjustments). After the adjustments, experiments were conducted for 30 min to measure the IP. In the experiments, significant right-sided asymmetries of the mean IP were found for each group ( P &lt; 0.05). The right buttocks of LH exhibited significantly more right-sided asymmetry of the mean IP than that of AB ( p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, the right buttocks of RH exhibited insignificant asymmetry of the mean IP compared to that of AB ( p &gt;0.21). The peak IPs of RH and LH were significantly higher than those of AB ( p &lt;0.05), and temporal changes of the mean and peak IP of hemiplegia were significant ( p &lt;0.05) and not significant ( p &gt;0.05), respectively. The RH exhibited affected-side weight-bearing based on the mean IP. In contrast, the LH relieved the mean IP on the affected-side buttock. Due to the right-sided asymmetric mean and high peak IP, hemiplegia in acute and recovery stages using wheelchairs can cause ulceration. Therefore, different rehabilitation approaches are required for the RH and LH to reduce the peak IP and avoid an uneven distribution of the mean IP."
