https://openalex.org/W2035712885,"Mitochondria play a central role in oxidative energy metabolism and age-related diseases such as cancer. Accumulation of spurious oxidative damage can cause cellular dysfunction. Antioxidant pathways that rely on NADPH are needed for the reduction of glutathione and maintenance of proper redox status. The mitochondrial matrix protein isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) is a major source of NADPH. Previously, we demonstrated that the NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT3 was essential for the prevention of age-related hearing loss in mice fed a calorically restricted diet. Here we provide direct biochemical and biological evidence establishing an exquisite regulatory relationship between IDH2 and SIRT3 under acute and chronic caloric restriction. The regulated site of acetylation was mapped to Lys-413, an evolutionarily invariant residue. Site-specific, genetic incorporation of N(ε)-acetyllysine into position 413 of IDH2 revealed that acetylated IDH2 displays a dramatic 44-fold loss in activity. Deacetylation by SIRT3 fully restored maximum IDH2 activity. The ability of SIRT3 to protect cells from oxidative stress was dependent on IDH2, and the deacetylated mimic, IDH2(K413R) variant was able to protect Sirt3(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts from oxidative stress through increased reduced glutathione levels. Together these results uncover a previously unknown mechanism by which SIRT3 regulates IDH2 under dietary restriction. Recent findings demonstrate that IDH2 activities are a major factor in cancer, and as such, these results implicate SIRT3 as a potential regulator of IDH2-dependent functions in cancer cell metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2077334192,"β-Carotene is the major dietary source of provitamin A. Central cleavage of β-carotene catalyzed by β-carotene oxygenase 1 yields two molecules of retinaldehyde. Subsequent oxidation produces all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), which functions as a ligand for a family of nuclear transcription factors, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs). Eccentric cleavage of β-carotene at non-central double bonds is catalyzed by other enzymes and can also occur non-enzymatically. The products of these reactions are β-apocarotenals and β-apocarotenones, whose biological functions in mammals are unknown. We used reporter gene assays to show that none of the β-apocarotenoids significantly activated RARs. Importantly, however, β-apo-14′-carotenal, β-apo-14′-carotenoic acid, and β-apo-13-carotenone antagonized ATRA-induced transactivation of RARs. Competitive radioligand binding assays demonstrated that these putative RAR antagonists compete directly with retinoic acid for high affinity binding to purified receptors. Molecular modeling studies confirmed that β-apo-13-carotenone can interact directly with the ligand binding site of the retinoid receptors. β-Apo-13-carotenone and the β-apo-14′-carotenoids inhibited ATRA-induced expression of retinoid responsive genes in Hep G2 cells. Finally, we developed an LC/MS method and found 3–5 nm β-apo-13-carotenone was present in human plasma. These findings suggest that β-apocarotenoids function as naturally occurring retinoid antagonists. The antagonism of retinoid signaling by these metabolites may have implications for the activities of dietary β-carotene as a provitamin A and as a modulator of risk for cardiovascular disease and cancer. β-Carotene is the major dietary source of provitamin A.

https://openalex.org/W1968686188,"This paper examines the proximity of authors to those they cite using degrees of separation in a co-author network, essentially using collaboration networks to expand on the notion of self-citations. While the proportion of direct self-citations (including co-authors of both citing and cited papers) is relatively constant in time and across specialties in the natural sciences (10% of citations) and the social sciences (20%), the same cannot be said for citations to authors who are members of the co-author network. Differences between fields and trends over time lie not only in the degree of co-authorship which defines the large-scale topology of the collaboration network, but also in the referencing practices within a given discipline, computed by defining a propensity to cite at a given distance within the collaboration network. Overall, there is little tendency to cite those nearby in the collaboration network, excluding direct self-citations. By analyzing these social references, we characterize the social capital of local collaboration networks in terms of the knowledge production within scientific fields. These results have implications for the long-standing debate over biases common to most types of citation analysis, and for understanding citation practices across scientific disciplines over the past 50 years. In addition, our findings have important practical implications for the availability of 'arm's length' expert reviewers of grant applications and manuscripts."
https://openalex.org/W2131441612,"In patients with glioblastomas, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key mediator of tumor-associated angiogenesis. Glioblastomas are notorious for their capacity to induce neovascularization, driving continued tumor growth. Here we report that miR-125b is down-regulated in glioblastoma-associated endothelial cells, resulting in increased expression of its target, myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ), a transcription factor that regulates VEGF. The down-regulation of miR-125b was also observed on exposure of endothelial cells to glioblastoma-conditioned medium or VEGF, resulting in increased MAZ expression. Further analysis revealed that inhibition of MAZ accumulation by miR-125b, or by MAZ-specific shRNAs, attenuated primary human brain endothelial cell migration and tubule formation in vitro, phenomena considered to mimick angiogenic processes in vitro. Moreover, MAZ expression was elevated in brain blood vessels of glioblastoma patients. Altogether these results demonstrate a functional feed-forward loop in glioblastoma-related angiogenesis, in which VEGF inhibits the expression of miR-125b, resulting in increased expression of MAZ, which in its turn causes transcriptional activation of VEGF. This loop is functionally impeded by the VEGF receptor inhibitor vandetanib, and our results may contribute to the further development of inhibitors of tumor-angiogenesis.—Smits, M., Wurdinger, T., van het Hof, B., Drexhage, J.

https://openalex.org/W2110239825,"Development of pulmonary hypertension is a common and deadly complication of interstitial lung disease. Little is known regarding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that lead to pulmonary hypertension in patients with interstitial lung disease, and effective treatment options are lacking. The purpose of this study was to examine the adenosine 2B receptor (A(2B)R) as a regulator of vascular remodeling and pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary fibrosis. To accomplish this, cellular and molecular changes in vascular remodeling were monitored in mice exposed to bleomycin in conjunction with genetic removal of the A(2B)R or treatment with the A(2B)R antagonist GS-6201. Results demonstrated that GS-6201 treatment or genetic removal of the A(2B)R attenuated vascular remodeling and hypertension in our model. Furthermore, direct A(2B)R activation on vascular cells promoted interleukin-6 and endothelin-1 release. These studies identify a novel mechanism of disease progression to pulmonary hypertension and support the development of A(2B)R antagonists for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension secondary to interstitial lung disease."
https://openalex.org/W1981742703,"Mismatch between the uptake and utilization of long-chain fatty acids in the myocardium leads to abnormally high intracellular fatty acid concentration, which ultimately induces myocardial dysfunction. Stearoyl-Coenzyme A desaturase-1 (SCD1) is a rate-limiting enzyme that converts saturated fatty acids (SFAs) to monounsaturated fatty acids. Previous studies have shown that SCD1-deficinent mice are protected from insulin resistance and diet-induced obesity; however, the role of SCD1 in the heart remains to be determined. We examined the expression of SCD1 in obese rat hearts induced by a sucrose-rich diet for 3 months. We also examined the effect of SCD1 on myocardial energy metabolism and apoptotic cell death in neonatal rat cardiac myocytes in the presence of SFAs. Here we showed that the expression of SCD1 increases 3.6-fold without measurable change in the expression of lipogenic genes in the heart of rats fed a high-sucrose diet. Forced SCD1 expression augmented palmitic acid-induced lipid accumulation, but attenuated excess fatty acid oxidation and restored reduced glucose oxidation. Of importance, SCD1 substantially inhibited SFA-induced caspase 3 activation, ceramide synthesis, diacylglycerol synthesis, apoptotic cell death, and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Experiments using SCD1 siRNA confirmed these observations. Furthermore, we showed that exposure of cardiac myocytes to glucose and insulin induced SCD1 expression. Our results indicate that SCD1 is highly regulated by a metabolic syndrome component in the heart, and such induction of SCD1 serves to alleviate SFA-induced adverse fatty acid catabolism, and eventually to prevent SFAs-induced apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2014390271,"N-lysine acetylation is a posttranslational modification that has been well studied in eukaryotes and is likely widespread in prokaryotes as well. The central metabolic enzyme acetyl-CoA synthetase is regulated in both bacteria and eukaryotes by acetylation of a conserved lysine residue in the active site. In the purple photosynthetic α-proteobacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris, two protein acetyltransferases (RpPat and the newly identified RpKatA) and two deacetylases (RpLdaA and RpSrtN) regulate the activities of AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases. In this work, we used LC/MS/MS to identify other proteins regulated by the N-lysine acetylation/deacetylation system of this bacterium. Of the 24 putative acetylated proteins identified, 14 were identified more often in a strain lacking both deacetylases. Nine of these proteins were members of the AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetase family. RpPat acetylated all nine of the acyl-CoA synthetases identified by this work, and RpLdaA deacetylated eight of them. In all cases, acetylation occurred at the conserved lysine residue in the active site, and acetylation decreased activity of the enzymes by >70%. Our results show that many different AMP-forming acyl-CoA synthetases are regulated by N-lysine acetylation. Five non-acyl-CoA synthetases were identified as possibly acetylated, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and Rpa1177, a putative 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase. Neither RpPat nor RpKatA acetylated either of these proteins in vitro. It has been reported that Salmonella enterica Pat (SePat) can acetylate a number of metabolic enzymes, including GAPDH, but we were unable to confirm this claim, suggesting that the substrate range of SePat is not as broad as suggested previously."
https://openalex.org/W2116676783,"Tuberculosis (TB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis constitutes an ongoing threat to global health. An antigen that can induce dendritic cell (DC) maturation and lead to enhanced cellular immunity is crucial to the development of an effective TB vaccine. Here, we investigated the functional roles and the related signaling mechanism of the Rv0577 protein, a M. tuberculosis complex-restricted secreted protein involved in the methylglyoxal detoxification pathway. Rv0577 recognizes Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and functionally induces DC maturation by augmenting the expression of cell surface molecules (CD80, CD86, and MHC class I and II) and proinflammatory cytokine production (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-12p70) in DCs on MyD88-dependent signaling, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and nuclear factor κB signaling pathways. In addition, Rv0577-treated DCs activated naive T cells, effectively polarized CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to secrete IFN-γ and IL-2, and induced T-cell proliferation, indicating that this protein possibly contributes to Th1-polarization of the immune response. More important, unlike LPS, Rv0577-treated DCs specifically induced the proliferation of memory CD4+/CD8+CD44high CD62Llow T cells in the spleen of M. tuberculosis-infected mice in a TLR2-dependent manner. Taken together, these findings suggest that Rv0577 may regulate innate and adaptive immunity by interacting with TLR2, a finding that could be helpful in the design of new TB vaccines.—Byun, E.-H., Kim, W.

https://openalex.org/W2117899562,"During forelimb regeneration in the newt Notophthalmus viridescens, the dynamic expression of a transitional matrix rich in hyaluronic acid, tenascin-C, and fibronectin controls muscle cell behavior in vivo and in vitro. However, the influence of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling on tissue stiffness and the cellular response to mechanical variations during regeneration was unknown. By measuring the transverse stiffness of tissues in situ, we found undifferentiated regenerative blastemas were less stiff than differentiated stump muscle (13.3±1.6 vs. 16.6±1.2 kPa). To directly determine how ECM and stiffness combine to affect skeletal muscle fragmentation, migration, and fusion, we coated silicone-based substrates ranging from 2 to 100 kPa with matrices representative of transitional (tenascin-C and fibronectin) and differentiated environments (laminin and Matrigel). Using live-cell imaging, we found softer tenascin-C-coated substrates significantly enhanced migration and fragmentation of primary newt muscle cells. In contrast, stiffer substrates coated with laminin, Matrigel, or fibronectin increased differentiation while suppressing migration and fragmentation. These data support our in vivo observations that a transitional matrix of reduced stiffness regulates muscle plasticity and progenitor cell recruitment into the regenerative blastema. These new findings will enable the determination of how biochemical and mechanical cues from the ECM control genetic pathways that drive regeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2127056262,"Cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) play an essential role in remodeling of the cardiac extracellular matrix. Extracellular nucleotide signaling may provoke a profibrotic response in CFs. We tested the hypothesis that physical perturbations release ATP from CFs and that ATP participates in profibrotic signaling. ATP release was abolished by the channel inhibitor carbenoxolone and inhibited by knockdown of either connexin (Cx)43 or Cx45 (47 and 35%, respectively), implying that hypotonic stimulation induces ATP release via Cx43 and Cx45 hemichannels, although pannexin 1 may also play a role. ATP released by hypotonic stimulation rapidly (<10 min) increased phosphorylated ERK by 5-8 fold, an effect largely eliminated by P2Y(2) receptor knockdown or ATP hydrolysis with apyrase. ATP stimulation of P2Y(2) receptors increased α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) production, and in an ERK-dependent manner, ATP increased collagen accumulation by 60% and mRNA expression of profibrotic markers: plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 by 4.5- and 4.0-fold, respectively. Apyrase treatment substantially reduced the basal profibrotic phenotype, decreasing collagen and α-SMA content and increasing matrix metalloproteinase expression. Thus, ATP release activates P2Y(2) receptors to mediate profibrotic responses in CFs, implying that nucleotide release under both basal and activated states is likely an important mechanism for fibroblast homeostasis."

IntroductionCryptococcus neoformans invades the brain and causes meningoencephalitis, primarily in immunocompromised patients and sporadically in normal hosts. It is the most common fungal infection of the central nervous system and is one of the major causes of death in AIDS patients (1Bicanic T. Harrison T.S. Cryptococcal meningitis.Br.

Cryptococcosis in the era of AIDS: 100 years after the discovery of Cryptococcus neoformans.Clin Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 515-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C. neoformans is encompassed by a polysaccharide capsule composed mainly of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) 3The abbreviations used are: GXMglucuronoxylomannanCSFcerebrospinal fluidBMECbrain microvascular endothelial cellGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinHAhyaluronic acid or hyaluronanHBMEChuman brain microvascular endothelial cellRHAMMreceptor of hyaluronan-mediated motilityYPDyeast extract, peptone, and dextrose.

Levitz S.M. Direct inhibition of T-cell responses by the Cryptococcus capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan.PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e120Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As such, the role and biogenesis of the capsule has become an area of focus for research in this pathogen (7Casadevall A. Nosanchuk J.D. Williamson P. Rodrigues M.L. Vesicular transport across the fungal cell wall.Trends Microbiol. 2009; 17: 158-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized the C. neoformans gene CPS1 (capsule polysaccharide synthase 1) (8Chang Y.C. Jong A. Huang S. Zerfas P. Kwon-Chung K.J. CPS1, a homolog of the Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 polysaccharide synthase gene, is important for the pathobiology of Cryptococcus neoformans.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 3930-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Deletion of CPS1 from C. neoformans cells causes alterations in the ultrastructure between the cell wall and capsule, and the deletant shows a reduced ability to associate with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (HA; also known as hyaluronan) can be detected in the wild-type C. neoformans strain but not in cps1Δ cells. Testing of C. neoformans strains with different concentrations of HA demonstrated that the ability of yeast to bind to HBMEC is proportional to their HA content. Subsequent analysis indicated that the CPS1 gene encodes an HA synthase (9Jong A. Wu C.H. Chen H.M. Luo F. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Lamunyon C.W. Plaas A. Huang S.H. Identification and characterization of CPS1 as a hyaluronic acid synthase contributing to the pathogenesis of C. neoformans infection.Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that the C. neoformans CPS1 gene product, HA, plays a role as an adhesion molecule during interaction with endothelial cells.Several HA-binding proteins (or HA receptors) localized in the membranes, such as CD44, RHAMM, Ivd4, LEC receptor, and others, have been identified in different cell types (10Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. Signaling properties of hyaluronan receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 11Bono P. Rubin K. Higgins J.M. Hynes R.O. Layilin, a novel integral membrane protein, is a hyaluronan receptor.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The most common HA receptor is CD44, which plays different roles in different cell types. As CD44 is a major membrane HA receptor, it is conceivable that C. neoformans HA directly engages with the HBMEC CD44 as a part of its invasion mechanism. Indeed, we have demonstrated that C. neoformans HA interacts with CD44 on HBMEC, a primary receptor in C. neoformans infection (12Jong A. Wu C.H. Shackleford G.M. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Chen H.M. Ouyang Y. Huang S.H. Involvement of human CD44 during Cryptococcus neoformans infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells.Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, an anti-CD44 neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduces C. neoformans association with HBMEC. Association of C. neoformans with HBMEC is also found to be considerably impaired either in CD44 knockdown HBMEC or HA-deficient C. neoformans strains. Likewise, overexpression of CD44 in HBMEC increases the association of C. neoformans with HBMEC. Furthermore, confocal microscopic images show that CD44 is enriched at and around the C. neoformans adhesion sites. Finally, upon C. neoformans and HBMEC engagement, a subpopulation of CD44 and β-actin are translocated to the host membrane lipid rafts. Our results highlight the interactions between C. neoformans HA and host CD44. The dynamic results of these interactions may represent events during the adhesion and entry of C. neoformans at HBMEC membrane rafts by eliciting downstream events of the entry process at HBMEC membrane rafts. Subsequently, membrane signaling may relay through CD44 to the actin cytoskeleton inside the HBMEC cells. Scanning electron microscopic images reveal the course of invasion: internalization by the microvilli embrace of C. neoformans, followed by a zipper-like mechanism in which the host cell plasma membrane encompasses the invading yeasts (13Chang Y.C. Stins M.F. McCaffery M.J. Miller G.F. Pare D.R. Dam T. Paul-Satyaseela M. Kim K.S. Kwon-Chung K.J. Cryptococcal yeast cells invade the central nervous system via transcellular penetration of the blood-brain barrier.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4985-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This mechanism requires C. neoformans cell-induced HBMEC cytoskeletal rearrangements for the accumulation of actin at the site of C. neoformans entry. The C. neoformans cell may then be drawn progressively into the host cell.Pathogens usually use multiple mechanisms to invade their host(s). Several studies have suggested that C. neoformans may use different routes to enter the brain. For example, transmission electron microscopic images showed that C. neoformans cells embedded inside macrophages could be found in the crossing site of the brain microcapillaries, suggesting a “Trojan horse” mechanism (14Chrétien F. Lortholary O. Kansau I. Neuville S. Gray F. Dromer F. Pathogenesis of cerebral Cryptococcus neoformans infection after fungemia.J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that urease is required for brain invasion (15Shi M. Li S.S. Zheng C. Jones G.J. Kim K.S. Zhou H. Kubes P. Mody C.H. Real-time imaging of trapping and urease-dependent transmigration of Cryptococcus neoformans in mouse brain.J. Clin.

Pathol. 2004; 164: 1761-1771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The roles of Ure1 and CPS1 in brain invasion are not necessarily mutually exclusive. However, their relevant functions are yet to be elucidated, and our understanding of their complicated invasion process has just begun. Recently, it has been documented that the lipid raft-dependent endocytosis process mediates C. neoformans internalization into HBMEC and that the CD44 protein of the hosts, cytoskeleton, and intracellular kinase DYRK3 are involved in this process (17Huang S.H. Long M. Wu C.H. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Chi F. Lee S. Jong A.

Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 34761-34769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Taken together, a transcellular mechanism seems to be the predominant route for C. neoformans brain invasion (13Chang Y.C. Stins M.F. McCaffery M.J. Miller G.F. Pare D.R. Dam T. Paul-Satyaseela M.

Wu C.H. Shackleford G.M. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Chen H.M. Ouyang Y. Huang S.H. Involvement of human CD44 during Cryptococcus neoformans infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells.Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The CPS1 deletion strain (C559) is temperature-sensitive (unable to grow at 37 °C), precluding in vivo studies. In this report, we used a mouse model to investigate C. neoformans brain invasion in vivo. In the virulent studies, the CD44 knock-out (KO) mice survived longer than the wild-type mice. Compared with the wild-type mice, the fungal load in the brain and CSF was lower in infected CD44 KO mice. Similarly, the CD44−/− mouse brain contained smaller and fewer cystic lesions. These results suggested that host CD44 is required for C. neoformans brain invasion. Immunofluorescence microscopic images of the brains sections showed that a mass of C. neoformans cells within the lesions are imbedded in their capsule material; these lesions were surrounded by many reactive astrocytes displaying a unique pattern. We also found that, in both the wild-type and CD44−/− mice, a secondary HA receptor, RHAMM, was present in the brain. Finally, we demonstrated the in vivo blocking effect of the hypolipidemic drug simvastatin. Our results suggest that simvastatin may remove receptor function on the membrane lipid raft or yet identified action(s), providing a cue for a novel anticryptococcal intervention.DISCUSSIONC. neoformans has a predilection for the brain and causes devastating cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. However, the mechanism of its brain invasion, resulting in central nervous system dysfunction, is still largely unknown. From our previous in vitro studies (12Jong A. Wu C.H. Shackleford G.M.

Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), we found that C. neoformans uses the host CD44 as the receptor and HA as the ligand in their association. To verify this finding in vivo, we used CD44−/− mice to explore the role of CD44 during C. neoformans invasion. Our results show that CD44−/− mice are more resistant to C. neoformans infection (Fig. 1). This is most likely because C. neoformans cells are less effective in crossing the blood-brain barrier in CD44−/− mice. In support of this hypothesis, the fungal loads of the brain as well as the cfu counts of CSF are lower in CD44−/− mice than in wild-type mice (Fig. 2). Thus, the CD44−/− mouse model is useful for in vivo C. neoformans brain infection studies. As a control, we used a pathogenic Escherichia coli E44 strain to perform the experiments; we observed no difference in invasion (data not shown). Thus, CD44 specifically is required for C. neoformans brain invasion. In complement, several CD44 functions have been documented in CD44−/− murine models from various studies. For example, studies with CD44−/− mice demonstrate that CD44 is a macrophage binding site for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (23Leemans J.C. Florquin S. Heikens M. Pals S.T. van der Neut R. Van Der Poll T. CD44 is a macrophage binding site for Mycobacterium tuberculosis that mediates macrophage recruitment and protective immunity against tuberculosis.J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that CD44 plays a critical role in the progression of atherosclerosis through the recruitment of macrophages to the atherosclerotic lesion (24Cuff C.A. Kothapalli D. Azonobi I. Chun S. Zhang Y. Belkin R. Yeh C. Secreto A. Assoian R.K. Rader D.J. Puré E. The adhesion receptor CD44 promotes atherosclerosis by mediating inflammatory cell recruitment and vascular cell activation.J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1031-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Moreover, CD44−/− mice injected with ConA exhibited a more severely acute suppurative hepatitis, suggesting that activated T cells use CD44 to undergo apoptosis and that dysregulation in this pathway could lead to increased pathogenesis in hepatitis (25Chen D. McKallip R.J. Zeytun A. Do Y. Lombard C. Robertson J.L. Mak T.W. Nagarkatti P.S. Nagarkatti M. CD44-deficient mice exhibit enhanced hepatitis after concanavalin A injection: evidence for involvement of CD44 in activation-induced cell death.J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 5889-5897Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Roles for CD44 in the resolution of lung injury (26Teder P. Vandivier R.W. Jiang D. Liang J. Cohn L. Puré E. Henson P.M. Noble P.W. Resolution of lung inflammation by CD44.Science. 2002; 296: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) and E. coli urinary tract infection (27Rouschop K.M. Sylva M. Teske G.J. Hoedemaeker I. Pals S.T. Weening J.J. van der Poll T. Florquin S. Urothelial CD44 facilitates Escherichia coli infection of the murine urinary tract.J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7225-7232Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have also been demonstrated. Our studies with CD44−/− mice also clearly demonstrate that CD44 plays a role during C. neoformans invasion (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). We further used anti-GFAP antibodies to examine the distribution of glial cells in infected brain sections. Interestingly, the staining of GFAP-positive glial cells (or reactive astrocytes) with prominent cytoplasmic processes showed a unique pattern, i.e. surrounding a mass of C. neoformans cells (Fig. 4). On the other hand, inflammation is not evident when C. neoformans invades the brain, which substantiates how C. neoformans, in general, could cause chronic meningoencephalitis.However, the use of a CD44−/− murine model is not without limitations. One puzzling occurrence is that there still remain some C. neoformans cells in the brains of CD44−/− mice (Fig. 2). Although CD44 is known to play a wide variety of roles, mice deficient in CD44 do not exhibit defects in development or neurological functions (28Schmits R. Filmus J. Gerwin N. Senaldi G. Kiefer F. Kundig T. Wakeham A. Shahinian A. Catzavelos C. Rak J. Furlonger C. Zakarian A. Simard J.J. Ohashi P.S. Paige C.J. Gutierrez-Ramos J.C. Mak T.W. CD44 regulates hematopoietic progenitor distribution, granuloma formation, and tumorigenicity.Blood. 1997; 90: 2217-2233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One possibility is that a second HA receptor may at least partially compensate for CD44 functions in the CD44−/− mice. Indeed, we have observed that another HA receptor, RHAMM, is present in the CD44−/− brain. The expression level of RHAMM is approximately the same in both wild-type and CD44−/−mouse brains (Fig. 5), and its ability to associate with C. neoformans is weaker than that of CD44 in vitro (Fig. 6). Similar observations of RHAMM compensation have been documented in a collagen-induced arthritis CD44 knock-out mouse model (21Nedvetzki S. Gonen E. Assayag N. Reich R. Williams R.O. Thurmond R.L. Huang J.F. Neudecker B.A. Wang F.S. Turley E.A. Naor D. RHAMM, a receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility, compensates for CD44 in inflamed CD44-knockout mice: a different interpretation of redundancy.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 18081-18086Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Based on the knowledge gained from our studies, we favor the possibility that CD44 is a primary HA receptor and that RHAMM, in the case of a CD44−/− background, partially compensates for the lack of CD44 (Fig. 6). The complexity of in vivo models may hinder a further pursuit. For example, a double KO of CD44 and RHAMM may induce expression of another HA receptor or may even cause a lethal phenotype. Additionally, pathogens may use multiple mechanisms to invade hosts and thus complicate the issue further. For example, it has been reported that the Trojan horse mechanism is another possible route for C. neoformans brain invasion (14Chrétien F. Lortholary O. Kansau I. Neuville S. Gray F. Dromer F. Pathogenesis of cerebral Cryptococcus neoformans infection after fungemia.J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, ample evidence shows that a transcellular mechanism may be the major one for C. neoformans brain invasion, as a free C. neoformans cell can be detected inside the brain a short time after i.v. injection (∼0.5 h) (13Chang Y.C. Stins M.F. McCaffery M.J. Miller G.F. Pare D.R. Dam T. Paul-Satyaseela M. Kim K.S. Kwon-Chung K.J. Cryptococcal yeast cells invade the central nervous system via transcellular penetration of the blood-brain barrier.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4985-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Although macrophages containing C. neoformans cells near the capillary in the brain parenchyma have been reported, it is unclear whether the inclusion of C. neoformans cells in macrophages occurred after C. neoformans crossed the blood-brain barrier. Macrophages or monocytes alter their morphology significantly when crossing the BMEC, and thus the Trojan horse mechanism may be suitable for viruses but not appropriate for the large size of C. neoformans (>5 μm in diameter plus its rigid cell wall). Overall, the complexity of the in vivo model prompts us to inquire, under certain pathophysiology conditions, as to what is the main mechanism of C. neoformans invasion rather than what specific mechanism(s) C. neoformans uses to invade the brain.Despite the limitations of the in vivo CD44−/− model, it is evident that HA receptors may exert their function(s) on surface membrane rafts. Sufficient evidence indicates that the CD44 (and RHAMM) function on membrane lipid rafts (12Jong A. Wu C.H. Shackleford G.M. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Chen H.M. Ouyang Y. Huang S.H. Involvement of human CD44 during Cryptococcus neoformans infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells.Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and the endocytic pathway (17Huang S.H. Long M. Wu C.H. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Chi F. Lee S. Jong A. Invasion of Cryptococcus neoformans into human brain microvascular endothelial cells is mediated through the lipid rafts-endocytic pathway via the dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 3 (DYRK3).J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 34761-34769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) are crucial for C. neoformans brain invasion. Blocking this pathway can be an effective way of attenuating the fungal infection. Indeed, our results (Fig. 7) show that simvastatin significantly reduced the brain fungal load. One possible mechanism is that simvastatin may exert its role on the membrane lipid rafts, disturbing CD44 and RHAMM functions and consequently attenuating cryptococcal meningitis (Fig. 7, B and C). Notably, it has been shown that statins have other actions (29Miida T. Hirayama S. Nakamura Y. Cholesterol-independent effects of statins and new therapeutic targets: ischemic stroke and dementia.J. Atheroscler. Thromb. 2004; 11: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); for example, administration of simvastatin in injured rat brains improves the outcome through attenuating the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response (30Chen G. Zhang S. Shi J. Ai J. Qi M. Hang C. Simvastatin reduces secondary brain injury caused by cortical contusion in rats: possible involvement of TLR4/NF-κB pathway.Exp. Neurol. 2009; 216: 398-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, the exact mechanisms by which simvastatin could offer protection against C. neoformans brain invasion requires further investigation. In any case, simvastatin is an FDA-approved drug with low toxicity. It is significant that simvastatin can drastically reduce the C. neoformans brain burden after treatment. Taken together, our studies support the view that inhibitors of lipid rafts (Ref. 12Jong A. Wu C.H. Shackleford G.M. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Chen H.M. Ouyang Y. Huang S.H. Involvement of human CD44 during Cryptococcus neoformans infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells.Cell.

IntroductionCryptococcus neoformans invades the brain and causes meningoencephalitis, primarily in immunocompromised patients and sporadically in normal hosts. It is the most common fungal infection of the central nervous system and is one of the major causes of death in AIDS patients (1Bicanic T. Harrison T.S. Cryptococcal meningitis.Br. Med Bull. 2004; 72: 99-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 2Mitchell T.G. Perfect J.R. Cryptococcosis in the era of AIDS: 100 years after the discovery of Cryptococcus neoformans.Clin Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 8: 515-548Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C. neoformans is encompassed by a polysaccharide capsule composed mainly of glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) 3The abbreviations used are: GXMglucuronoxylomannanCSFcerebrospinal fluidBMECbrain microvascular endothelial cellGFAPglial fibrillary acidic proteinHAhyaluronic acid or hyaluronanHBMEChuman brain microvascular endothelial cellRHAMMreceptor of hyaluronan-mediated motilityYPDyeast extract, peptone, and dextrose.

Levitz S.M. Direct inhibition of T-cell responses by the Cryptococcus capsular polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan.PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e120Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). As such, the role and biogenesis of the capsule has become an area of focus for research in this pathogen (7Casadevall A. Nosanchuk J.D. Williamson P. Rodrigues M.L. Vesicular transport across the fungal cell wall.Trends Microbiol. 2009; 17: 158-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Previously, we characterized the C. neoformans gene CPS1 (capsule polysaccharide synthase 1) (8Chang Y.C. Jong A. Huang S. Zerfas P. Kwon-Chung K.J. CPS1, a homolog of the Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 polysaccharide synthase gene, is important for the pathobiology of Cryptococcus neoformans.Infect. Immun. 2006; 74: 3930-3938Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Deletion of CPS1 from C. neoformans cells causes alterations in the ultrastructure between the cell wall and capsule, and the deletant shows a reduced ability to associate with human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). Polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (HA; also known as hyaluronan) can be detected in the wild-type C. neoformans strain but not in cps1Δ cells. Testing of C. neoformans strains with different concentrations of HA demonstrated that the ability of yeast to bind to HBMEC is proportional to their HA content. Subsequent analysis indicated that the CPS1 gene encodes an HA synthase (9Jong A. Wu C.H. Chen H.M. Luo F. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Lamunyon C.W. Plaas A. Huang S.H. Identification and characterization of CPS1 as a hyaluronic acid synthase contributing to the pathogenesis of C. neoformans infection.Eukaryot. Cell. 2007; 6: 1486-1496Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings indicate that the C. neoformans CPS1 gene product, HA, plays a role as an adhesion molecule during interaction with endothelial cells.Several HA-binding proteins (or HA receptors) localized in the membranes, such as CD44, RHAMM, Ivd4, LEC receptor, and others, have been identified in different cell types (10Turley E.A. Noble P.W. Bourguignon L.Y. Signaling properties of hyaluronan receptors.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4589-4592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (861) Google Scholar, 11Bono P. Rubin K. Higgins J.M. Hynes R.O. Layilin, a novel integral membrane protein, is a hyaluronan receptor.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 891-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The most common HA receptor is CD44, which plays different roles in different cell types. As CD44 is a major membrane HA receptor, it is conceivable that C. neoformans HA directly engages with the HBMEC CD44 as a part of its invasion mechanism. Indeed, we have demonstrated that C. neoformans HA interacts with CD44 on HBMEC, a primary receptor in C. neoformans infection (12Jong A. Wu C.H. Shackleford G.M. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Chen H.M. Ouyang Y. Huang S.H. Involvement of human CD44 during Cryptococcus neoformans infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells.Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For example, an anti-CD44 neutralizing antibody treatment significantly reduces C. neoformans association with HBMEC. Association of C. neoformans with HBMEC is also found to be considerably impaired either in CD44 knockdown HBMEC or HA-deficient C. neoformans strains. Likewise, overexpression of CD44 in HBMEC increases the association of C. neoformans with HBMEC. Furthermore, confocal microscopic images show that CD44 is enriched at and around the C. neoformans adhesion sites. Finally, upon C. neoformans and HBMEC engagement, a subpopulation of CD44 and β-actin are translocated to the host membrane lipid rafts. Our results highlight the interactions between C. neoformans HA and host CD44. The dynamic results of these interactions may represent events during the adhesion and entry of C. neoformans at HBMEC membrane rafts by eliciting downstream events of the entry process at HBMEC membrane rafts. Subsequently, membrane signaling may relay through CD44 to the actin cytoskeleton inside the HBMEC cells. Scanning electron microscopic images reveal the course of invasion: internalization by the microvilli embrace of C. neoformans, followed by a zipper-like mechanism in which the host cell plasma membrane encompasses the invading yeasts (13Chang Y.C. Stins M.F. McCaffery M.J. Miller G.F. Pare D.R. Dam T. Paul-Satyaseela M. Kim K.S. Kwon-Chung K.J. Cryptococcal yeast cells invade the central nervous system via transcellular penetration of the blood-brain barrier.Infect. Immun. 2004; 72: 4985-4995Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This mechanism requires C. neoformans cell-induced HBMEC cytoskeletal rearrangements for the accumulation of actin at the site of C. neoformans entry. The C. neoformans cell may then be drawn progressively into the host cell.Pathogens usually use multiple mechanisms to invade their host(s). Several studies have suggested that C. neoformans may use different routes to enter the brain. For example, transmission electron microscopic images showed that C. neoformans cells embedded inside macrophages could be found in the crossing site of the brain microcapillaries, suggesting a “Trojan horse” mechanism (14Chrétien F. Lortholary O. Kansau I. Neuville S. Gray F. Dromer F. Pathogenesis of cerebral Cryptococcus neoformans infection after fungemia.J. Infect. Dis. 2002; 186: 522-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that urease is required for brain invasion (15Shi M. Li S.S. Zheng C. Jones G.J. Kim K.S. Zhou H. Kubes P. Mody C.H. Real-time imaging of trapping and urease-dependent transmigration of Cryptococcus neoformans in mouse brain.J. Clin.

Pathol. 2004; 164: 1761-1771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The roles of Ure1 and CPS1 in brain invasion are not necessarily mutually exclusive. However, their relevant functions are yet to be elucidated, and our understanding of their complicated invasion process has just begun. Recently, it has been documented that the lipid raft-dependent endocytosis process mediates C. neoformans internalization into HBMEC and that the CD44 protein of the hosts, cytoskeleton, and intracellular kinase DYRK3 are involved in this process (17Huang S.H. Long M. Wu C.H. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Chi F. Lee S. Jong A. Invasion of Cryptococcus neoformans into human brain microvascular endothelial cells is mediated through the lipid rafts-endocytic pathway via the dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 3 (DYRK3).J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 34761-34769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Taken together, a transcellular mechanism seems to be the predominant route for C. neoformans brain invasion (13Chang Y.C. Stins M.F. McCaffery M.J. Miller G.F. Pare D.R. Dam T. Paul-Satyaseela M.

Wu C.H. Shackleford G.M. Kwon-Chung K.J. Chang Y.C. Chen H.M. Ouyang Y. Huang S.H. Involvement of human CD44 during Cryptococcus neoformans infection of brain microvascular endothelial cells.Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The CPS1 deletion strain (C559) is temperature-sensitive (unable to grow at 37 °C), precluding in vivo studies. In this report, we used a mouse model to investigate C. neoformans brain invasion in vivo. In the virulent studies, the CD44 knock-out (KO) mice survived longer than the wild-type mice. Compared with the wild-type mice, the fungal load in the brain and CSF was lower in infected CD44 KO mice. Similarly, the CD44−/− mouse brain contained smaller and fewer cystic lesions. These results suggested that host CD44 is required for C. neoformans brain invasion. Immunofluorescence microscopic images of the brains sections showed that a mass of C. neoformans cells within the lesions are imbedded in their capsule material; these lesions were surrounded by many reactive astrocytes displaying a unique pattern. We also found that, in both the wild-type and CD44−/− mice, a secondary HA receptor, RHAMM, was present in the brain. Finally, we demonstrated the in vivo blocking effect of the hypolipidemic drug simvastatin. Our results suggest that simvastatin may remove receptor function on the membrane lipid raft or yet identified action(s), providing a cue for a novel anticryptococcal intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2091588921,"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is currently the fifth leading cause of death worldwide. Neutrophilic inflammation is prominent, worsened during infective exacerbations and is refractory to glucocorticosteroids (GCs). Deregulated neutrophilic inflammation can cause excessive matrix degradation through proteinase release. Gelatinase and azurophilic granules within neutrophils are a major source of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and neutrophil elastase (NE), respectively, which are elevated in COPD.Secreted MMP-9 and NE activity in BALF were stratified according to GOLD severity stages. The regulation of secreted NE and MMP-9 in isolated blood neutrophils was investigated using a pharmacological approach. In vivo release of MMP-9 and NE in mice exposed to cigarette smoke (CS) and/or the TLR agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the presence of dexamethasone (Dex) was investigated.Neutrophil activation as assessed by NE release was increased in severe COPD (36-fold, GOLD II vs. IV). MMP-9 levels (8-fold) and activity (21-fold) were also elevated in severe COPD, and this activity was strongly associated with BALF neutrophils (r = 0.92, p<0.001), but not macrophages (r = 0.48, p = 0.13). In vitro, release of NE and MMP-9 from fMLP stimulated blood neutrophils was insensitive to Dex and attenuated by the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin. In vivo, GC resistant neutrophil activation (NE release) was only seen in mice exposed to CS and LPS. In addition, GC refractory MMP-9 expression was only associated with neutrophil activation.As neutrophils become activated with increasing COPD severity, they become an important source of NE and MMP-9 activity, which secrete proteinases independently of TIMPs. Furthermore, as NE and MMP-9 release was resistant to GC, targeting of the PI3K pathway may offer an alternative pathway to combating this proteinase imbalance in severe COPD."

Although IL-1 alone can sufficiently prolong osteoclast survival and activate osteoclast function, IL-1-mediated osteoclastogenesis requires the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) ligand (RANKL). However, the molecular basis of the dependence of IL-1-mediated osteoclastogenesis on RANKL is not fully understood. Here we show that although IL-1 cannot activate the expression of the osteoclast genes encoding matrix metalloproteinase 9, cathepsin K, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, and carbonic anhydrase II in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs), RANKL renders these osteoclast genes responsive to IL-1. We further demonstrate that IL-1 alone fails to induce the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cell cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), a master transcriptional regulator of osteoclastogenesis), in BMMs but can up-regulate its expression in the presence of permissive levels of RANKL or with RANKL pretreatment. The RANK IVVY motif, which has been previously shown to commit BMMs to the osteoclast lineage in RANKL- and TNF α-mediated osteoclastogenesis, also plays a crucial role in IL-1-mediated osteoclastogenesis by changing the four osteoclast marker and NFATc1 genes to an IL-1-inducible state. Finally, we show that MyD88, a known critical component of the IL-1 receptor I signaling pathway, plays a crucial role in IL-1-mediated osteoclastogenesis from RANKL-primed BMMs by up-regulating the expression of the osteoclast marker and NFATc1 genes.

Osteoclasts, the sole bone-resorbing cells, differentiate from cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage upon stimulation by two key factors: the macrophage/monocyte colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and RANKL (11Boyle W.J. Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Osteoclast differentiation and activation.Nature. 2003; 423: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (4897) Google Scholar). Although M-CSF stimulates the proliferation and survival of osteoclast precursors, RANKL is the main differentiation-promoting factor. RANKL, a member of the TNF superfamily, exerts its functions by activating its receptor, RANK, which belongs to the TNF receptor superfamily (12Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. A homologue of the TNF receptor and its ligand enhances T-cell growth and dendritic-cell function.Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1941) Google Scholar). Members of the TNF receptor family lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and, thus, transduce downstream signals mostly by recruiting TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs) (8Jimi E. Nakamura I. Duong L.T. Ikebe T. Takahashi N. Rodan G.A. Suda T. Interleukin 1 induces multinucleation and bone-resorbing activity of osteoclasts in the absence of osteoblasts/stromal cells.Exp.

It has now been established that RANK possesses three cytoplasmic motifs (PFQEP369–373, PVQEET559–564, and PVQEQG604–609) that can recruit TRAFs to activate six major signaling pathways (NF-κB, JNK, ERK, p38, NFATc1, and Akt) to regulate the formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts (14Feng X.

Ca2+-NFATc1 signaling is an essential axis of osteoclast differentiation.Immunol. Rev. 2009; 231: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Moreover, our group has identified a TRAF-independent motif (IVVY535–538) in the RANK cytoplasmic domain that plays an essential role in committing BMMs, namely osteoclast precursors, to the osteoclast lineage in vitro (18Xu D. Wang S. Liu W. Liu J. Feng X. A novel receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) cytoplasmic motif plays an essential role in osteoclastogenesis by committing macrophages to the osteoclast lineage.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 4678-4690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The IVVY motif has also been demonstrated to regulate osteoclast formation and function in vivo (19Kim H. Choi H.K. Shin J.H. Kim K.H. Huh J.Y. Lee S.A. Ko C.Y. Kim H.S. Shin H.I. Lee H.J. Jeong D.

Invest. 2009; 119: 813-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). IL-1 exerts its functions by activating IL-1 receptor I (IL-1RI), its main signaling receptor (1Dinarello C.A. Immunological and inflammatory functions of the interleukin-1 family.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar). Activation of IL-1RI leads to the recruitment of IL-1 receptor-associated factor (IL1Racf), which forms a complex with myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), IL-1 receptor-associated kinases (IRAKs), and TRAF6 to transduce downstream signaling. Also, IL-1 has another receptor, IL-1RII, which contains only 29 amino acids in its cytoplasmic tail and is thus unable to transduce signaling. As a result, IL-1RII functions as a decoy receptor and inhibits IL-1 signaling by competing with IL-1RI for IL-1. Notably, IL-1 shares many similarities in function and pathobiology with TNF, another potent proinflammatory factor (1Dinarello C.A. Immunological and inflammatory functions of the interleukin-1 family.Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2009; 27: 519-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (2493) Google Scholar, 20Beyaert R. Fiers W. Mires-Sluis A. Thorpe R. Cytokines. Academic Press Limited, San Diego1998: 335-360Google Scholar). Moreover, both IL-1 and TNF are concomitantly elevated in postmenopausal osteoporosis (5Nakamura I. Jimi E.

The contribution of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor to periodontal tissue destruction.J. Periodontol. 2003; 74: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). More importantly, these two cytokines are implicated in bone loss associated with these diseases. Particularly, although both IL-1 and TNF can activate TRAF-dependent signaling pathways (1Dinarello C.A. Immunological and inflammatory functions of the interleukin-1 family.Annu. Rev.

In this study, we investigate the molecular basis of the dependence of IL-1-mediated osteoclastogenesis on RANKL by examining the involvement of this RANK IVVY motif in IL-1-mediated osteoclastogenesis. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Synthetic oligonucleotides were from Sigma-Genosys. Alexa Fluor-488 phalloidin (catalog no. A12379) and Hoechst-33258 (catalog no.

Anti-human Fas antibody conjugated with phycoerythrin (catalog no. sc-21730PE) and anti-NFATc1 antibody (catalog no. sc-7294) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Recombinant GST-RANKL was prepared as described previously (25McHugh K.P. Hodivala-Dilke K. Zheng M.H. Namba N. Lam J. Novack D. Feng X. Ross F.P. Hynes R.O. Teitelbaum S.L. Mice lacking β3 integrins are osteosclerotic because of dysfunctional osteoclasts.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Mouse M-CSF was prepared from a M-CSF-producing cell line, CMG14-12, as described previously (26Takeshita S. Kaji K. Kudo A.

The C3H and C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Harlan Industries (Indianapolis, IN), and MyD88−/− breeding pairs were obtained under a material transfer agreement from Dr. Shizuo Akira (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan). The experiments involving mice were performed in accordance with the regulations of the University of Alabama at Birmingham institutional animal care and use committee. In vitro osteoclastogenesis assays were performed by treating BMMs (5 × 104 cells/well) in 24-well tissue culture plates with M-CSF (44 ng/ml) and different doses of GST-RANKL and/or IL-1 as indicated in individual assays. Cultures were then stained for TRAP activity with a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (catalog no. 387-A) from Sigma. The assays were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice. In vitro osteoclast formation on bone slices was carried out by seeding BMMs (5 × 104 cells/well) on bovine cortical bone slices in 24-well tissue culture plates, and the cells were then cultured as indicated in individual experiments. Bone slices were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 min at room temperature, then treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 8 min, and finally stained with Alexa Fluor 488 phalloidin and Hoechst-33258 for 15 min for actin ring and nucleic staining, respectively. Bone slices were analyzed and imaged using a Leica DMIRBE inverted UV SP1 confocal microscope system with Leica confocal software at the imaging facility of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The assays were performed in triplicates, and a representative view from each assay was shown. Osteoclastogenesis assays were quantified by counting the multinucleated TRAP-positive cells (> 3 nuclei) in a representative area in each of three replicate samples. BMMs, 5 × 104 cells/well, were seeded on bovine cortical bone slices plated in 24-well culture plates and treated under conditions indicated in individual experiments. Bone slices were then harvested, and cells were removed with 0.25 m ammonium hydroxide and mechanical agitation. Bone resorption pits were visualized and imaged by scanning electron microscopy using a Philips 515 scanning electron microscope in the Material Engineering Department at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Bone resorption assays were performed in triplicates, and a representative area from each assay was shown. The data were quantified by measuring the percentage of resorbed areas in three random resorption areas. The percentage of the resorbed area was determined using ImageJ analysis software from the National Institutes o Health. The retrovirus packaging cells, 293GPG, were maintained in DMEM with 10% heat-inactivated FBS supplemented with tetracycline, puromycin, G418, and penicillin/streptomycin as described previously (28Ory D.S.

BMMs were then infected with virus for 24 h in the presence of M-CSF (220 ng/ml) and 8 μg/ml polybrene. Cells were further cultured with M-CSF (220 ng/ml) for 24 h, and then the cultures were continued with M-CSF (220 ng/ml) and puromycin (2 μg/ml) for selection and expansion of infected cells. 1 × 106 infected BMMs were suspended in 200 ml α-minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS supplemented with M-CSF (44 ng/ml) and then blocked with 1 μg of 2.4G2 antibody (30Unkeless J.C. Characterization of a monoclonal antibody directed against mouse macrophage and lymphocyte Fc receptors.J. Exp. Med. 1979; 150: 580-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar) for 30 mins at 4 °C. Under dim light, 10 μl human Fas antibody conjugated with phycoerythrin was added to each cell suspension, and cells were further incubated for 30 mins at 4 °C. Cells were then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. Cells were subsequently washed three times by gently resuspending cells with α-minimal essential medium followed by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min. After the final wash, cells were suspended in 1 ml α-minimal essential medium for cytometric analysis using a BD Biosciences LSR II flow cytometer at the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Following treatments indicated in individual experiments, BMMs were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1× protease inhibitor mixture 1 (Sigma, catalog no.

Tissue Int. 1998; 63: 63-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Membranes were washed extensively, and an ECL detection assay was performed using a SuperSignal West Dura kit from Pierce. Total RNA was prepared from BMMs using TRIzol reagent from Invitrogen. 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA with oligo(dT) in a 20 μl volume at 50 °C for 60 min using the SuperScript III RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). The RT reaction was then followed by enzyme inactivation and RNA H digestion. PCR amplification of the MMP9, Ctsk, TRAP, Car2, and GAPDH genes was performed as described previously (24Jules J. Shi Z.

All semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays were independently repeated twice. Total RNA was prepared from BMMs using TRIzol reagent from Invitrogen. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA by reverse transcription using a QuantiTect RT kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR was performed using a Lightcycler (Roche) with FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I reagent (Roche) and PCR primers used in a previous study (24Jules J. Shi Z. Liu J. Xu D. Wang S. Feng X. Receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) cytoplasmic IVVY535–538 motif plays an essential role in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF)-mediated osteoclastogenesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 37427-37435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Relative quantities of the tested genes were normalized to GAPDH mRNA. The normalized data were expressed using the comparative 2−ΔΔCT method. All real-time RT-PCR assays were independently repeated twice. Bone resorption and osteoclastogenesis data are expressed as mean ± S.D. of percent resorbed area (bone resorption) and numbers of TRAP-positive cells, respectively. Statistical significance was determined using Student's t test, and p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. It has been reported that although IL-1 alone cannot promote osteoclastogenesis in tissue culture dishes, it can do so in the presence of permissive levels of RANKL or with RANKL pretreatment (9Ma T. Miyanishi K. Suen A. Epstein N.J. Tomita T. Smith R.L. Goodman S.B. Human interleukin-1-induced murine osteoclastogenesis is dependent on RANKL, but independent of TNF-α.Cytokine. 2004; 26: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 10Wei S. Kitaura H. Zhou P. Ross F.P. Teitelbaum S.L. IL-1 mediates TNF-induced osteoclastogenesis.J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) (32Kim J.H. Jin H.M. Kim K. Song I. Youn B.U. Matsuo K. Kim N. The mechanism of osteoclast differentiation induced by IL-1.J. Immunol. 2009; 183: 1862-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether this intriguing finding holds true for osteoclastogenesis on bone surface, which represents a physiological substratum for osteoclastogenesis. Before addressing this critical issue, we first confirmed the previous findings in our hands and found, consistent with the reported data, that IL-1 alone cannot mediate osteoclastogenesis in tissue culture dishes (supplemental Fig. 1A) but that it can do so with permissive levels of RANKL (supplemental Fig. 2, A and B) or RANKL pretreatment (supplemental Fig. 3A). We then investigated the role of IL-1 in osteoclastogenesis on bone slices. IL-1 fails to stimulate osteoclastogenesis on bone slices (supplemental Fig. 1, B and C), which was supported by the absence of actin ring and multinucleation, two important features of mature osteoclasts, and lack of resorption pits. Yet, IL-1 can mediate osteoclastogenesis on bone slices in the presence of permissive levels of RANKL (supplemental Fig. 2, C and D) or with RANKL pretreatment (supplemental Fig. 3, B–D). However, the osteoclasts generated under the RANKL pretreatment have a low resorptive capacity (supplemental Fig. 3D). These data further indicate that IL-1-mediated osteoclastogenesis requires RANKL priming. Interestingly, although IL-1 cannot promote osteoclastogenesis in the absence of RANKL, IL-1-pretreatment can enhance osteoclastogenesis from BMMs treated with low levels of RANKL (supplemental Fig. 4A). Furthermore, IL-1 dose-dependently promotes osteoclastogenesis in the presence of permissive levels of RANKL (supplemental Fig. 4, B and C). These findings suggest that IL-1 is capable of sensitizing BMMs to RANKL treatment and enhancing the activation of certain common signaling pathways shared by IL-1 and RANKL. RANKL stimulates osteoclastogenesis by inducing the expression of numerous genes, including MMP9, Ctsk, TRAP, and Car2 (33Cappellen D. Luong-Nguyen N.H. Bongiovanni S. Grenet O. Wanke C. Susa M. Transcriptional program of mouse osteoclast differentiation governed by the macrophage colony-stimulating factor and the ligand for the receptor activator of NFκ B.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21971-21982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To examine the molecular basis of the inability of IL-1 to mediate osteoclastogenesis, we determined the ability of IL-1 to activate these four osteoclast genes. RANKL activated the expression of these genes with time (Fig. 1A, lanes 2, 5, and 8), but IL-1 treatment for as long as 4 days failed to do so (lanes 3, 6, and 9), indicating that the inability of IL-1 to activate the expression of the osteoclast genes accounts for its failure to stimulate osteoclastogenesis. Given that IL-1 can mediate osteoclastogenesis in the presence of permissive levels of RANKL, we next addressed whether permissive levels of RANKL can make these genes responsive to IL-1. 10 ng/ml RANKL weakly activated gene expression (Fig. 1B, lanes 1, 4, and 7), and IL-1 completely failed to do so (lanes 2, 5, and 8). Nonetheless, 10 ng/ml RANKL plus 5 ng/ml IL-1 considerably activated the Ctsk, TRAP, and Car2 genes at day 2 (lane 6) and the MMP9 gene at day 4 (lane 9, Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate that the RANKL-mediated priming, in part, involves rendering osteoclast genes responsive to IL-1. We next determined whether RANKL pretreatment can also render the four osteoclast marker genes responsive to IL-1. 36-hour RANKL pretreatment rendered all four genes responsive to IL-1 (Fig. 1C, lanes 3 and 6). However, without subsequent stimulation with either RANKL or IL-1, the express"
https://openalex.org/W2023098391,"Interleukin 9 (IL-9) has been implicated in mast cell-related inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, where vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is involved. Here we report that IL-9 (10-20 ng/ml) induces gene expression and secretion of VEGF from human LAD2. IL-9 does not induce mast cell degranulation or the release of other mediators (IL-1, IL-8, or TNF). VEGF production in response to IL-9 involves STAT-3 activation. The effect is inhibited (about 80%) by the STAT-3 inhibitor, Stattic. Gene-expression of IL-9 and IL-9 receptor is significantly increased in lesional skin areas of atopic dermatitis (AD) patients as compared to normal control skin, while serum IL-9 is not different from controls. These results imply that functional interactions between IL-9 and mast cells leading to VEGF release contribute to the initiation/propagation of the pathogenesis of AD, a skin inflammatory disease."

Proteins found in nacre were believed to be “natural hands” that control nacre formation. In the classical view of nacre formation, nucleation of the main minerals, calcium carbonate, is induced on and by the acidic proteins in nacre. However, the basic proteins were not expected to be components of nacre. Here, we reported that a novel basic protein, PfN23, was a key accelerator in the control over crystal growth in nacre. The expression profile, in situ immunostaining, and in vitro immunodetection assays showed that PfN23 was localized within calcium carbonate crystals in the nacre. Knocking down the expression of PfN23 in adults via double-stranded RNA injection led to a disordered nacre surface in adults. Blocking the translation of PfN23 in embryos using morpholino oligomers led to the arrest of larval development. The in vitro crystallization assay showed that PfN23 increases the rate of calcium carbonate deposition and induced the formation of aragonite crystals with characteristics close to nacre. In addition, we constructed the peptides and truncations of different regions of this protein and found that the positively charged C-terminal region was a key region for the function of PfN23 Taken together, the basic protein PfN23 may be a key accelerator in the control of crystal growth in nacre.

Knocking down the expression of PfN23 in adults via double-stranded RNA injection led to a disordered nacre surface in adults. Blocking the translation of PfN23 in embryos using morpholino oligomers led to the arrest of larval development. The in vitro crystallization assay showed that PfN23 increases the rate of calcium carbonate deposition and induced the formation of aragonite crystals with characteristics close to nacre. In addition, we constructed the peptides and truncations of different regions of this protein and found that the positively charged C-terminal region was a key region for the function of PfN23 Taken together, the basic protein PfN23 may be a key accelerator in the control of crystal growth in nacre. This provides a valuable balance to the classic view that acidic proteins control calcium carbonate deposition in nacre."
https://openalex.org/W2163736174,"Vitiligo is characterized by a mostly progressive loss of the inherited skin color. The cause of the disease is still unknown, despite accumulating in vivo and in vitro evidence of massive oxidative stress via hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and peroxynitrite (ONOO–) in the skin of affected individuals. The most favored hypothesis is based on autoimmune mechanisms. Since depletion of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan (Trp) severely affects various immune responses, we here looked at Trp metabolism and signaling in these patients. Our in vivo and in vitro data revealed total absence of epidermal Trp hydroxylase activities and the presence of H2O2/ONOO– deactivated indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor signaling is severely impaired despite the ligand (Trp dimer) being formed, as shown by mass spectrometry. Loss of this signal is supported by the absence of downstream signals (COX-2 and CYP1A1) as well as regulatory T-lymphocytes and by computer modeling. In vivo Fourier transform Raman spectroscopy confirmed the presence of Trp metabolites together with H2O2 supporting deprivation of the epidermal Trp pool by Fenton chemistry. Taken together, our data support a long-expressed role for in loco redox balance and a distinct immune response. These insights could open novel treatment strategies for this disease.—Schallreuter, K. U., Salem, M. A. E. L., Gibbons, N. C. J., Maitland, D. J., Marsch, E., Elwary, S., Healey, A. R.

https://openalex.org/W2103762083,"After separating from a primary tumor, metastasizing cells enter the circulatory system and interact with host cells before lodging in secondary organs. Previous studies have implicated the surface glycoproteins CD44 and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in adhesion, migration, and invasion, suggesting that they may influence metastatic progression. To elucidate the role of these multifunctional molecules while avoiding the potential drawbacks of ectopic expression or monoclonal antibody treatments, we silenced the expression of CD44 and/or CEA in LS174T colon carcinoma cells and analyzed their ability to metastasize in 2 independent mouse models. Quantitative PCR revealed that CD44 knockdown increased lung and liver metastasis >10-fold, while metastasis was decreased by >50% following CEA knockdown. These findings were corroborated by in vitro experiments assessing the metastatic potential of LS174T cells. Cell migration was decreased as a result of silencing CEA but was enhanced in CD44-knockdown cells. In addition, CD44 silencing promoted homotypic aggregation of LS147T cells, a phenotype that was reversed by additional CEA knockdown. Finally, CD44-knockdown cells exhibited greater mechanical compliance than control cells, a property that correlates with increased metastatic potential. Collectively, these data indicate that CEA, but not CD44, is a viable target for therapeutics aimed at curbing colon carcinoma metastasis."

https://openalex.org/W2130507343,"Coral reefs are experiencing unprecedented degradation due to human activities, and protecting specific reef habitats may not stop this decline, because the most serious threats are global (i.e., climate change), not local. However, ex situ preservation practices can provide safeguards for coral reef conservation. Specifically, modern advances in cryobiology and genome banking could secure existing species and genetic diversity until genotypes can be introduced into rehabilitated habitats. We assessed the feasibility of recovering viable sperm and embryonic cells post-thaw from two coral species, Acropora palmata and Fungia scutaria that have diffferent evolutionary histories, ecological niches and reproductive strategies. In vitro fertilization (IVF) of conspecific eggs using fresh (control) spermatozoa revealed high levels of fertilization (>90% in A. palmata; >84% in F. scutaria; P>0.05) that were unaffected by tested sperm concentrations. A solution of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at cooling rates of 20 to 30°C/min most successfully cryopreserved both A. palmata and F. scutaria spermatozoa and allowed producing developing larvae in vitro. IVF success under these conditions was 65% in A. palmata and 53% in F. scutaria on particular nights; however, on subsequent nights, the same process resulted in little or no IVF success. Thus, the window for optimal freezing of high quality spermatozoa was short (∼5 h for one night each spawning cycle). Additionally, cryopreserved F. scutaria embryonic cells had∼50% post-thaw viability as measured by intact membranes. Thus, despite some differences between species, coral spermatozoa and embryonic cells are viable after low temperature (−196°C) storage, preservation and thawing. Based on these results, we have begun systematically banking coral spermatozoa and embryonic cells on a large-scale as a support approach for preserving existing bio- and genetic diversity found in reef systems."
https://openalex.org/W2025529104,"Tumor suppressor PTEN is known to control a variety of processes related to cell survival, proliferation, and growth. PTEN expression is considered as a prognostic factor in some human neoplasms like breast, prostate, and thyroid cancer.In this study we analyzed the influence of PTEN expression on the outcome of a randomized clinical trial of conventional versus 7-days-a-week postoperative radiotherapy for squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. The patients with cancer of the oral cavity, oropharynx, and larynx were randomized to receive 63 Gy in fractions of 1.8 Gy given 5 days a week (CF) or 7 days a week (p-CAIR). Out of 279 patients enrolled in the study, 147 paraffin blocks were available for an immunohistochemical assessment of PTEN. To evaluate the prognostic value of PTEN expression and the effect of fractionation relative to PTEN, the data on the outcome of a randomized clinical trial were analyzed. Tumors with a high intensity of PTEN staining had significant gain in the loco-regional control (LRC) from p-CAIR (5-year LRC 92.7% vs. 70.8%, for p-CAIR vs. CF, p = 0.016, RR = 0.26). By contrast, tumors with low intensity of PTEN did not gain from p-CAIR (5-year LRC 56.2% vs. 47.2%, p = 0.49, RR = 0.94). The intensity of PTEN highly affected the LRC in a whole group of 147 patients (5-year LRC 80.9% vs. 52.3% for high vs. low PTEN, p = 0.0007, RR = 0.32). In multivariate Cox analysis, including neck node involvement, EGFR, nm23, Ki-67, p53, cyclin D1, tumor site and margins, PTEN remained an independent predictor of LRC (RR = 2.8 p = 0.004).These results suggest that PTEN may serve as a potent prognostic and predictive marker in postoperative radiotherapy for high-risk squamous cell cancer of the head and neck."
https://openalex.org/W1981568831,"Background In recent decades the frequency and severity of natural disturbances by e.g., strong winds and insect outbreaks has increased considerably in many forest ecosystems around the world. Future climate change is expected to further intensify disturbance regimes, which makes addressing disturbances in ecosystem management a top priority. As a prerequisite a broader understanding of disturbance impacts and ecosystem responses is needed. With regard to the effects of strong winds – the most detrimental disturbance agent in Europe – monitoring and management has focused on structural damage, i.e., tree mortality from uprooting and stem breakage. Effects on the functioning of trees surviving the storm (e.g., their productivity and allocation) have been rarely accounted for to date. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we show that growth reduction was significant and pervasive in a 6.79·million hectare forest landscape in southern Sweden following the storm Gudrun (January 2005). Wind-related growth reduction in Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests surviving the storm exceeded 10% in the worst hit regions, and was closely related to maximum gust wind speed (R2 = 0.849) and structural wind damage (R2 = 0.782). At the landscape scale, wind-related growth reduction amounted to 3.0 million m3 in the three years following Gudrun. It thus exceeds secondary damage from bark beetles after Gudrun as well as the long-term average storm damage from uprooting and stem breakage in Sweden. Conclusions/Significance We conclude that the impact of strong winds on forest ecosystems is not limited to the immediately visible area of structural damage, and call for a broader consideration of disturbance effects on ecosystem structure and functioning in the context of forest management and climate change mitigation."
https://openalex.org/W2042004725,"In the early stages of breast cancer metastasis, epithelial cells penetrate the basement membrane and invade the surrounding stroma, where they encounter fibroblasts. Paracrine signaling between fibroblasts and epithelial tumor cells contributes to the metastatic cascade, but little is known about the role of adhesive contacts between these two cell types in metastasis. Here we show that MCF-7 breast cancer epithelial cells and normal breast fibroblasts form heterotypic adhesions when grown together in co-culture, as evidenced by adhesion assays. PCR and immunoblotting show that both cell types express multiple members of the cadherin superfamily, including the atypical cadherin, cadherin-23, when grown in isolation and in co-culture. Immunocytochemistry experiments show that cadherin-23 localizes to homotypic adhesions between MCF-7 cells and also to heterotypic adhesions between the epithelial cells and fibroblasts, and antibody inhibition and RNAi experiments show that cadherin-23 plays a role in mediating these adhesive interactions. Finally, we show that cadherin-23 is upregulated in breast cancer tissue samples, and we hypothesize that heterotypic adhesions mediated by this atypical cadherin may play a role in the early stages of metastasis."

We have investigated how the hypoxic tumor microenvironment in ESCC fosters the induction of IGFBP3. RNA interference experiments revealed that hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, but not HIF-2α, regulates IGFBP3 mRNA induction. By chromatin immunoprecipitation and transfection assays, HIF-1α was found to transactivate IGFBP3 through a novel hypoxia responsive element (HRE) located at 57 kb upstream from the transcription start site. Metabolic labeling experiments demonstrated hypoxia-mediated inhibition of global protein synthesis. 7-Methyl GTP-cap binding assays suggested that hypoxia suppresses cap-dependent translation. Experiments using pharmacological inhibitors for mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) suggested that a relatively weak mTOR activity may be sufficient for cap-dependent translation of IGFBP3 under hypoxic conditions. Bicistronic RNA reporter transfection assays did not validate the possibility of an internal ribosome entry site as a potential mechanism for cap-independent translation for IGFBP3 mRNA. Finally, IGFBP3 mRNA was found enriched to the polysomes. In aggregate, our study establishes IGFBP3 as a direct HIF-1α target gene and that polysome enrichment of IGFBP3 mRNA may permit continuous translation under hypoxic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2144494828,"Vitiligo is characterized by a progressive loss of inherited skin color. The cause of the disease is still unknown. To date, there is accumulating in vivo and in vitro evidence for massive oxidative stress via hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and peroxynitrite (ONOO–) in the skin of affected individuals. Autoimmune etiology is the favored theory. Since depletion of the essential amino acid L-tryptophan (Trp) affects immune response mechanisms, we here looked at epidermal Trp metabolism via tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH) with its downstream cascade, including serotonin and melatonin. Our in situ immunofluorescence and Western blot data reveal significantly lower TPH1 expression in patients with vitiligo. Expression is also low in melanocytes and keratinocytes under in vitro conditions. Although in vivo Fourier transform-Raman spectroscopy proves the presence of 5-hydroxytryptophan, epidermal TPH activity is completely absent. Regulation of TPH via microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and L-type calcium channels is severely affected. Moreover, dopa decarboxylase (DDC) expression is significantly lower, in association with decreased serotonin and melatonin levels. Computer simulation supports H2O2/ONOO–-mediated oxidation/nitration of TPH1 and DDC, affecting, in turn, enzyme functionality. Taken together, our data point to depletion of epidermal Trp by Fenton chemistry and exclude melatonin as a relevant contributor to epidermal redox balance and immune response in vitiligo.—Schallreuter, K.

At present, we have little understanding how the enzyme activity is regulated. In this study we wanted to characterize the role of α5β1 integrin in ADAM17 activity regulation during G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) stimulation.We showed previously that the profibrotic GPCR agonist serotonin (5-HT) induced kidney mesangial cell proliferation through ADAM17 activation and heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) shedding. In the present studies we observed that in unstimulated mesangial cell lysates α5β1 integrin co-precipitated with ADAM17 and that 5-HT treatment of the cells induced dissociation of α5β1 integrin from ADAM17. Using fluorescence immunostaining and in situ proximity ligation assay, we identified the perinuclear region as the localization of the ADAM17/α5β1 integrin interaction. In cell-free assays, we showed that purified α5β1 integrin and β1 integrin dose-dependently bound to and inhibited activity of recombinant ADAM17. We provided evidence that the conformation of the integrin determines its ADAM17-binding ability. To study the effect of β1 integrin on ADAM17 sheddase activity, we employed alkaline phosphatase-tagged HB-EGF. Overexpression of β1 integrin lead to complete inhibition of 5-HT-induced HB-EGF shedding and silencing β1 integrin by siRNA significantly increased mesangial cells ADAM17 responsiveness to 5-HT.Our data show for the first time that β1 integrin has an important physiological role in ADAM17 activity regulation. We suggest that regulating α5β1 integrin binding to ADAM17 could be an attractive therapeutic target in chronic kidney diseases."

In a transcriptomic and metabolomic study across tissues, we examined serotype-specific regulation of signaling and metabolic pathways in C57BL/6 mice intratracheally instilled with either serotype 19F Streptococcus pneumoniae (S19; causing lobar pneumonia), or serotype 2 S. pneumoniae (S2; causing septic pneumococcal disease,) or vehicle (Todd-Hewitt broth). Samples of lung, liver, and blood were collected at 6 and 24 h postinfection and subjected to microarray analysis and mass spectrometry. Results comprise a preferential induction of cholesterol biosynthesis in lobar pneumonia at low-infection doses (105 colony forming units/mouse) leading to increased plasma cholesterol (vehicle: 1.8 ±0.12 mM, S2: 2.3±0.10 mM, S19: 2.9±0.15 mM; P>0.05, comparing S19 to vehicle and S2). This induction was pneumolysin dependent, as a pneumolysin-deficient strain of serotype 19F failed to induce cholesterol biosynthesis (S19ΔPLY: 1.9±0.03 mM). Preincubation of pneumolysin with purified cholesterol or plasma from hypercholesterolemic mice prior to intratracheal instillation protected against lung barrier dysfunction and alveolar macrophage necrosis.

There is no specific vaccine against BU but reports show some degree of cross-reactive protection conferred by M. bovis BCG immunization. Alternatively, an M. ulcerans-specific immunization could be a better preventive strategy.In this study, we used the mouse model to characterize the histological and cytokine profiles triggered by vaccination with either BCG or mycolactone-negative M. ulcerans, followed by footpad infection with virulent M. ulcerans. We observed that BCG vaccination significantly delayed the onset of M. ulcerans growth and footpad swelling through the induction of an earlier and sustained IFN-γ T cell response in the draining lymph node (DLN). BCG vaccination also resulted in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) in M. ulcerans-infected footpads, given the predominance of a chronic mononuclear infiltrate positive for iNOS, as well as increased and sustained levels of IFN-γ and TNF. No significant IL-4, IL-17 or IL-10 responses were detected in the footpad or the DLN, in either infected or vaccinated mice. Despite this protective Th1 response, BCG vaccination did not avoid the later progression of M. ulcerans infection, regardless of challenge dose. Immunization with mycolactone-deficient M. ulcerans also significantly delayed the progression of footpad infection, swelling and ulceration, but ultimately M. ulcerans pathogenic mechanisms prevailed.The delay in the emergence of pathology observed in vaccinated mice emphasizes the relevance of protective Th1 recall responses against M. ulcerans. In future studies it will be important to determine how the transient CMI induced by vaccination is compromised."
https://openalex.org/W2054100735,"To identify the genes involved in chondrocytic differentiation, we applied gene trap mutagenesis to a murine mesenchymal chondrogenic cell line ATDC5 and isolated a clone in which the gene encoding vinculin was trapped. The trapped allele was assumed to express a fusion protein containing a truncated vinculin lacking the tail domain and the geo product derived from the trap vector. The truncated vinculin was suggested to exert a dominant negative effect. Impaired functioning of vinculin caused by gene trapping in ATDC5 cells or knockdown in primary chondrocytes resulted in the reduced expression of chondrocyte-specific genes, including Col2a1, aggrecan, and Col10a1. The expression of Runx2 also was suppressed by the dysfunctional vinculin. On the other hand, the expression of Sox9, encoding a key transcription factor for chondrogenesis, was retained. Knockdown of vinculin in metatarsal organ cultures impaired the growth of the explants and reduced the expression of Col2a1 and aggrecan. Gene trapping or knockdown of vinculin decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 but increased that of Src homology 2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and Akt during chondrocytic differentiation, suggesting a disturbance of signaling by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). Knockdown of vinculin in the metatarsal organ culture abrogated the IGF-I-induced growth and inhibited the up-regulation of Col2a1 and aggrecan expression by IGF-I. Loss of vinculin function in differentiating chondrocytes impaired the activation of the p38 MAPK pathway also, suggesting its involvement in the regulation of chondrogenesis by vinculin. Our results indicate a tissue-specific function of vinculin in cartilage whereby it controls chondrocytic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1987930017,"Oscillations in plasma membrane potential play a central role in glucose-induced insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells and related insulinoma cell lines. We have employed a novel fluorescent plasma membrane potential (Δψ(p)) indicator in combination with indicators of cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) ([Ca(2+)](c)), mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ(m)), matrix ATP concentration, and NAD(P)H fluorescence to investigate the role of mitochondria in the generation of plasma membrane potential oscillations in clonal INS-1 832/13 β-cells. Elevated glucose caused oscillations in plasma membrane potential and cytoplasmic free Ca(2+) concentration over the same concentration range required for insulin release, although considerable cell-to-cell heterogeneity was observed. Exogenous pyruvate was as effective as glucose in inducing oscillations, both in the presence and absence of 2.8 mM glucose. Increased glucose and pyruvate each produced a concentration-dependent mitochondrial hyperpolarization. The causal relationships between pairs of parameters (Δψ(p) and [Ca(2+)](c), Δψ(p) and NAD(P)H, matrix ATP and [Ca(2+)](c), and Δψ(m) and [Ca(2+)](c)) were investigated at single cell level. It is concluded that, in these β-cells, depolarizing oscillations in Δψ(p) are not initiated by mitochondrial bioenergetic changes. Instead, regardless of substrate, it appears that the mitochondria may simply be required to exceed a critical bioenergetic threshold to allow release of insulin. Once this threshold is exceeded, an autonomous Δψ(p) oscillatory mechanism is initiated."

S2R (sigma-2 receptor)/Pgrmc1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) is a cytochrome b(5)-related drug-binding orphan receptor essential for tumor formation and invasion. Secretory proteins drive these processes, so we screened for S2R(Pgrmc1)-dependent secreted proteins using antibody arrays. S2R(Pgrmc1) markedly regulated the expression of NGAL/LCN2 (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin/lipocalin 2), a secreted glycoprotein that binds to MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) and protects it from degradation. S2R(Pgrmc1) knock-down blocked NGAL/LCN2 expression at the protein and RNA levels and decreased MMP9 activity. NGAL expression was required for MMP-9 activity and tumor formation. S2R(Pgrmc1) associates with EGFR and increases EGFR levels at the plasma membrane, and the EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and AG1478, as well as Akt and ERK inhibitors, suppressed the NGAL/LCN2 RNA and protein levels. NGAL is transcriptionally regulated by NFκB, and S2R(Pgrmc1) knock-down decreased the NFκB subunit p65/RelA acetylation, phosphorylation, and activation. In S2R(Pgrmc1) knock-down cells, p65 acetylation was reversed by inhibitors of histone deacetylase 1, and the inhibitors partially restored NGAL levels. Our results are consistent with a model in which S2R(Pgrmc1) increases NGAL/LCN2 levels by activating NFκB via EGFR."
https://openalex.org/W2025629169,"Interstitial fluid flow (IFF) is a potent regulatory signal in bone. During mechanical loading, IFF is generated through two distinct mechanisms that result in spatially distinct flow profiles: poroelastic interactions within the lacunar-canalicular system, and intramedullary pressurization. While the former generates IFF primarily within the lacunar-canalicular network, the latter generates significant flow at the endosteal surface as well as within the tissue. This gives rise to the intriguing possibility that loading-induced IFF may differentially activate osteocytes or surface-residing cells depending on the generating mechanism, and that sensation of IFF generated via intramedullary pressurization may be mediated by a non-osteocytic bone cell population. To begin to explore this possibility, we used the Dmp1-HBEGF inducible osteocyte ablation mouse model and a microfluidic system for modulating intramedullary pressure (ImP) to assess whether structural adaptation to ImP-driven IFF is altered by partial osteocyte depletion. Canalicular convective velocities during pressurization were estimated through the use of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and computational modeling. Following osteocyte ablation, transgenic mice exhibited severe losses in bone structure and altered responses to hindlimb suspension in a compartment-specific manner. In pressure-loaded limbs, transgenic mice displayed similar or significantly enhanced structural adaptation to Imp-driven IFF, particularly in the trabecular compartment, despite up to ∼50% of trabecular lacunae being uninhabited following ablation. Interestingly, regression analysis revealed relative gains in bone structure in pressure-loaded limbs were correlated with reductions in bone structure in unpressurized control limbs, suggesting that adaptation to ImP-driven IFF was potentiated by increases in osteoclastic activity and/or reductions in osteoblastic activity incurred independently of pressure loading. Collectively, these studies indicate that structural adaptation to ImP-driven IFF can proceed unimpeded following a significant depletion in osteocytes, consistent with the potential existence of a non-osteocytic bone cell population that senses ImP-driven IFF independently and potentially parallel to osteocytic sensation of poroelasticity-derived IFF."

These proteins participate in the apoptotic pathway, and the interaction between them may serve as a target for anticancer lead compounds. In response to apoptotic signals, MTCH2 recruits tBID to the mitochondria, where it activates apoptosis. A combination of peptide arrays screening with biochemical and biophysical techniques was used to characterize the mechanism of the interaction between tBID and MTCH2 at the structural and molecular levels. The regions that mediate the interaction between the proteins were identified. The two specific binding sites between the proteins were determined to be tBID residues 59-73 that bind MTCH2 residues 140-161, and tBID residues 111-125 that bind MTCH2 residues 240-290. Peptides derived from tBID residues 111-125 and 59-73 induced cell death in osteosarcoma cells. These peptides may serve as lead compounds for anticancer drugs that act by targeting the tBID-MTCH2 interaction."

It is known that the first step in the pathway is catalyzed by a family of polypeptide-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, which covalently modify Ser/Thr by the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) (2Brockhausen I. Schachter H. Stanley P. Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Certozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. Essentials of Glycobiology.

The resulting structure is known as the Tn antigen (GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr) and is the common precursor structure to all mucin-type O-glycans (3Ju T. Otto V.I. Cummings R.D.

Glycoproteins and their relationship to human disease.Acta Anat. 1998; 161: 36-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although it is estimated that 20 different polypeptide-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases are involved in the first step (5Gill D.J. Clausen H. Bard F. Location, location, location. New insights into O-GalNAc protein glycosylation.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the common next step in biosynthesis in vertebrates is catalyzed by a single enzyme termed the T-synthase (core 1 β1–3-galactosyltransferase), which adds galactose onto the Tn antigen to form the core 1 disaccharide Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr (T antigen) (3Ju T.

The T antigen can be further modified by several downstream glycosyltransferases in the Golgi compartment to form complex O-glycans (3Ju T. Otto V.I. Cummings R.D.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 9228-9233Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In principle, chaperones typically interact specifically with unfolded but not with folded proteins, facilitating the formation of native structures (19Fink A.L. Chaperone-mediated protein folding.Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) and are not part of the mature client protein (20Ellis R.J. The molecular chaperone concept.Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Several families of chaperones are responsible for protein folding in the ER; those most studied are the HSP70 family member BiP (Grp78), protein-disulfide isomerase, and calnexin/calreticulin families, all of which have different types of chaperone cycles for substrate binding and release (21Kriegenburg F.

Protein folding and modification in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 71-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Some ER molecular chaperones recognize many clients, but there are a large number of client-specific or client-restricted ER molecular chaperones (22Braakman I. Bulleid N.J. Protein folding and modification in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 71-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar).Previous studies have shown that Cosmc is ER localized (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D.

Chem. 2011; 286: 11529-11542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and that Cosmc can promote the reactivation of denatured T-synthase; the accumulated information suggests that the T-synthase is a specific client for Cosmc (10Aryal R.P. Ju T. Cummings R.D. The endoplasmic reticulum chaperone Cosmc directly promotes in vitro folding of T-synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2456-2462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of Cosmc function in the ER as a chaperone and its client-specific binding and release are not well understood. Here we present mechanistic insights on how Cosmc acts to promote formation of functional T-synthase and the conditions for binding and release of T-synthase after refolding. Our results support the hypothesis that Cosmc binds reversibly to non-native T-synthase and promotes its folding independent of other chaperones.DISCUSSIONOur results show that soluble Cosmc directly interacts in a specific manner with denatured, but not native, T-synthase to form a noncovalent and reversible complex that results in the acquisition of T-synthase catalytic activity. In addition, the release of the T-synthase from the Cosmc-T-synthase complex in vitro is promoted by both non-native and native T-synthase, whereas ATP, calcium, and pH, which are known regulators of several ER chaperones, do not promote release. These results provide new information about the specific mechanisms of Cosmc function, and also provide insight into the quality control systems for generation of functional T-synthase.The T-synthase is a typical type II transmembrane protein with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a 26-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 331-amino acid functional lumenal domain (37Ju T. Brewer K. D'Souza A. Cummings R.D. Canfield W.M. Cloning and expression of human core 1 β1,3-galactosyltransferase.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 178-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Type II membrane proteins fold in the ER during co-translational insertion where they encounter many co-translational controls, which include simultaneous tethering of their N- and C-terminal sequences during biosynthesis, translation rate, interactions with chaperones, and post-translational modifications, including N-glycosylation and formation of disulfide bonds (22Braakman I. Bulleid N.J. Protein folding and modification in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 71-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). In all of these processes there are multiple quality control checkpoints to limit accumulation of misfolded or misassembled proteins, but the overall nature of the quality control system in the ER is poorly understood. Intermolecular interactions between proteins of identical sequence, so-called domain or strand swapping, can lead to protein aggregation and misfolding (38Betts S. King J.

Libonati M. Eisenberg D. A domain-swapped RNase A dimer with implications for amyloid formation.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Misfolding or misassembly of proteins in the ER can result in their retrotranslocation back into the cytoplasm, where they become ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome, as we showed previously for the T-synthase in the absence of Cosmc (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. Regulation of protein O-glycosylation by the endoplasmic reticulum-localized molecular chaperone Cosmc.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar).The physiological importance of these processes, and in particular the role of Cosmc in T-synthase folding, was initially revealed by studies in patients with Tn syndrome, who exhibit acquired loss-of-function mutations in the X-linked Cosmc gene, resulting in loss of functional T-synthase (14Ju T.

Studies in cell lines showed that loss of Cosmc results in efficient ubiquitin/proteasomal degradation of T-synthase, and that drug blockade of degradation results in the accumulation of inactive aggregates of T-synthase.

Chem. 2011; 286: 11529-11542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), together with recent evidence that Cosmc is required in cells for co-translational biosynthesis of T-synthase (30Narimatsu Y. Kubota T. Furukawa S. Shimojima M. Iwasaki H. Tozawa Y. Tachibana K. Narimatsu H. Co-translational function of Cosmc, core 1 synthase-specific molecular chaperone, revealed by a cell-free translation system.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585: 1276-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), suggests a model for T-synthase biosynthesis shown in Fig. 7. We propose that the interaction between Cosmc and unfolded T-synthase in the ER results in the formation of a stable noncovalent complex, and that within this complex the T-synthase is prevented from forming oligomeric complexes where folding and maturation to active dimeric enzyme are hindered. Thus, in the absence of Cosmc the T-synthase will accumulate and eventually be exported from the ER and degraded in a ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent manner. We also showed previously that the accumulated and misfolded T-synthase oligomers are co-precipitable with ER chaperones (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. Regulation of protein O-glycosylation by the endoplasmic reticulum-localized molecular chaperone Cosmc.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), such as BiP, which are probably involved in the unfolded protein response to the accumulated T-synthase and may be important in its eventual exit from the ER. By contrast, in the presence of Cosmc, the stable complex between T-synthase and Cosmc results in folding of T-synthase to an active enzyme, perhaps a monomer, which is released from the complex through competition with additional unfolded or newly synthesized T-synthase and forms active dimers themselves or by the assistance from Cosmc. Additionally, released monomers could form dimers with reactivated T-synthase associated with Cosmc, thereby promoting the release of reactivated T-synthase.This dimerization process for the T-synthase could happen spontaneously or with the assistance from Cosmc. In cells lacking Cosmc no dimeric forms of T-synthase accumulate, and only high molecular aggregates, prior to their proteasomal degradation, accumulate (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D. Regulation of protein O-glycosylation by the endoplasmic reticulum-localized molecular chaperone Cosmc.J. Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Cosmc and T-synthase share a potential common ancestor, and show 26% overall sequence identity. Whether this similarity in sequence is related in some way to their potential interactions is unknown, because Cosmc does not bind to native T-synthase. Such information about the potential dimeric interfaces of active T-synthase will hopefully be forthcoming upon crystallization of the protein in the future. It is also possible that T-synthase might have two independent binding domains, one for Cosmc and the other for its dimerization. In such a case, as soon as dimeric T-synthase forms, stable dimeric T-synthase dissociates from Cosmc. Furthermore, the current data suggest that at least in vitro, Cosmc alone is sufficient to bind to and facilitate folding of T-synthase independent of other factors. Thus, in the absence of Cosmc in patients with Tn syndrome, other ER chaperones are not able to rescue T-synthase, but are more likely involved in its degradation and removal. Such a specific requirement of Cosmc to make functional T-synthase both in vitro and in vivo might be partly explained by their nature of similarity.The ability of Cosmc to discriminate between native T-synthase, to which it does not bind, and non-native T-synthase, to which it binds tightly, suggest that there may be unique structural elements exposed in the non-native structure. The dissociation of the Cosmc complex with denatured T-synthase by urea, but not by DTT and other dissociative reagents, show that the interactions are noncovalent. The exact nature of these structural elements within T-synthase remain to be identified, but they are likely to be inherent in vertebrate T-synthase, which requires Cosmc for function, but absent in invertebrate T-synthases, as for Caenorhabditis elegans (41Ju T. Zheng Q. Cummings R.D. Identification of core 1 O-glycan T-synthase from Caenorhabditis elegans.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 947-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or Drosophila (42Müller R.

In addition, unlike the invertebrate T-synthases (41Ju T. Zheng Q. Cummings R.D. Identification of core 1 O-glycan T-synthase from Caenorhabditis elegans.Glycobiology. 2006; 16: 947-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), the vertebrate T-synthase is not N-glycosylated, so ER folding pathways involving N-glycan recognition are not involved in vertebrate T-synthase folding (44Ellgaard L. Helenius A. Quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (1656) Google Scholar). The ability of Cosmc to associate with non-native T-synthase appears to be similar in general to that of other molecular chaperones including Hsp70 (45Palleros D.R. Shi L. Reid K.L. Fink A.L.

Chem. 1994; 269: 13107-13114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Cpn60 (GroEL) (46Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H.

Baici A. Gehring H. Christen P. Kinetics of molecular chaperone action.Science. 1994; 263: 971-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) with their substrates, although these chaperones are not client-specific. Interestingly, studies by others (27Alexander W.S. Viney E.M. Zhang J.G. Metcalf D. Kauppi M. Hyland C.D. Carpinelli M.R. Stevenson W. Croker B.A. Hilton A.A. Ellis S. Selan C. Nandurkar H.H.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 16442-16447Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), as well as our own (10Aryal R.P. Ju T. Cummings R.D. The endoplasmic reticulum chaperone Cosmc directly promotes in vitro folding of T-synthase.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2456-2462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), had shown that recombinant Cosmc slightly enhances the activity of T-synthase preparations, which suggested the remote possibility that Cosmc and T-synthase may form a weak heterodimer or hetero-oligomer for maximal activity. However, our results definitively show that highly purified T-synthase, obtained by affinity chromatography on asialo-BSM, does not interact with Cosmc and addition of Cosmc does not affect the activity of the highly purified T-synthase. Thus, no such heterodimer form of mature T-synthase and Cosmc occurs.Unexpectedly, we found that Cosmc and heat or chemically denatured T-synthase form a relatively stable complex, consistent with a role for Cosmc in preventing irreversible aggregation of non-native T-synthase. Similar stable complexes between chaperones and their substrates have been reported, such as α-crystalline and carbonic anhydrase (48Rao P.V. Horwitz J. Zigler Jr., J.S. α-Crystallin, a molecular chaperone, forms a stable complex with carbonic anhydrase upon heat denaturation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 190: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and GroEL and ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (46Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Reconstitution of active dimeric ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase from an unfoleded state depends on two chaperonin proteins and Mg-ATP.Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). We also showed that Cosmc remains associated with the reconstituted catalytically active form of T-synthase. Such a stable complex might appear to be inconsistent with one of the characteristics of molecular chaperones, which is that they do not form part of the final functional structure (20Ellis R.J. The molecular chaperone concept.Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). However, our finding that further addition of denatured or native T-synthase to the complex of Cosmc with reconstituted T-synthase causes dissociation of the bound T-synthase, strongly suggests that the Cosmc-associated T-synthase represents a transitional stage in the folding process, because the native form of T-synthase does not bind to Cosmc. Such transitional intermediates in protein folding in association with chaperones are difficult to define and further work in this direction is needed.We demonstrated that Cosmc facilitates reacquisition of activity in denatured T-synthase even in reducing environments, suggesting that Cosmc is not a redox-regulated chaperone. Although ATP regulates many chaperone cycles and Cosmc binds to ATP (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D.

Ohta M. Growth suppression of Escherichia coli by induction of expression of mammalian genes with transmembrane or ATPase domains.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 553-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we saw no effect of either ATP or ATPγS in our in vitro experiments. Furthermore, refolded Cosmc following GdmHCl denaturation could refold independently and could reactivate heat-denatured T-synthase, further suggesting that Cosmc action in vitro is not dependent on ATP. Interestingly, some ER chaperones, such as Hps47, are regulated by pH; the chaperone binds and releases the substrate by exploiting the change in pH from the ER to the Golgi environment (33Saga S. Nagata K. Chen W.T. Yamada K.M. pH-dependent function, purification, and intracellular location of a major collagen-binding glycoprotein.J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Additionally, chaperones such as Hsp90, protein-disulfide isomerase, ERp72, Calreticulin, and p50 are regulated by calcium (34Nigam S.K. Goldberg A.L. Ho S. Rohde M.F. Bush K.T. Sherman M.

Chem. 1994; 269: 1744-1749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, our results show that within the physiological range of pH and calcium, the complex of Cosmc and reconstituted T-synthase do not easily dissociate, which demonstrates that Cosmc is not regulated by either pH or calcium in its chaperone functions.The identified role of Cosmc as a specific regulator of T-synthase formation and acquisition of activity reflects the growing understanding of molecular regulators in forming glycosyltransferases, which are mostly type II transmembrane proteins. The formation of this class of enzymes in the ER and their movements to other organelles in the secretory pathway may require a suite of chaperones and additional proteins for correct folding/localization/activity, as shown recently for chitin synthase III, which requires Chs7p to prevent oligomerization and allow COPII vesicle export from the ER (50Trilla J.A.

However, mechanistically little is known about such systems, and it is possible that other glycosyltransferases may need chaperones or co-factors to regulate their activities, but clearly more research is needed. Our studies on Cosmc and its specific interactions with T-synthase provide detailed insights into the specific mechanisms of how such a specific chaperone functions to generate its active client enzyme and may be relevant to studies of biosynthesis of other glycosyltransferases and ER/Golgi resident proteins. IntroductionMucin-type O-glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications to animal glycoproteins, and is important in many biological processes (1Hang H.C. Bertozzi C.R. The chemistry and biology of mucin-type O-linked glycosylation.Bioorg. Med. Chem. 2005; 13: 5021-5034Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), but the overall regulation of this complex pathway is poorly understood. It is known that the first step in the pathway is catalyzed by a family of polypeptide-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases, which covalently modify Ser/Thr by the addition of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) (2Brockhausen I. Schachter H. Stanley P. Varki A. Cummings R.D. Esko J.D. Freeze H.H. Stanley P. Certozzi C.R. Hart G.W. Etzler M.E. Essentials of Glycobiology. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York2009: 115-128Google Scholar). The resulting structure is known as the Tn antigen (GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr) and is the common precursor structure to all mucin-type O-glycans (3Ju T. Otto V.I. Cummings R.D. The Tn antigen-structural simplicity and biological complexity.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50: 1770-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 4Brockhausen I. Schutzbach J. Kuhns W. Glycoproteins and their relationship to human disease.Acta Anat. 1998; 161: 36-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Although it is estimated that 20 different polypeptide-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases are involved in the first step (5Gill D.J. Clausen H. Bard F. Location, location, location. New insights into O-GalNAc protein glycosylation.Trends Cell Biol. 2011; 21: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), the common next step in biosynthesis in vertebrates is catalyzed by a single enzyme termed the T-synthase (core 1 β1–3-galactosyltransferase), which adds galactose onto the Tn antigen to form the core 1 disaccharide Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-Ser/Thr (T antigen) (3Ju T. Otto V.I. Cummings R.D. The Tn antigen-structural simplicity and biological complexity.Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 2011; 50: 1770-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The T antigen can be further modified by several downstream glycosyltransferases in the Golgi compartment to form complex O-glycans (3Ju T. Otto V.I. Cummings R.D.

Importantly, T-synthase activity is in most cell types and T-synthase is coordinately expressed with Cosmc (16Ju T. Aryal R.P. Stowell C.J. Cummings R.D.

Chaperone-mediated protein folding.Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar) and are not part of the mature client protein (20Ellis R.J. The molecular chaperone concept.Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar). Several families of chaperones are responsible for protein folding in the ER; those most studied are the HSP70 family member BiP (Grp78), protein-disulfide isomerase, and calnexin/calreticulin families, all of which have different types of chaperone cycles for substrate binding and release (21Kriegenburg F.

Protein folding and modification in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 71-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Some ER molecular chaperones recognize many clients, but there are a large number of client-specific or client-restricted ER molecular chaperones (22Braakman I. Bulleid N.J. Protein folding and modification in the mammalian endoplasmic reticulum.Annu. Rev.

However, the mechanism of Cosmc function in the ER as a chaperone and its client-specific binding and release are not well understood. Here we present mechanistic insights on how Cosmc acts to promote formation of functional T-synthase and the conditions for binding and release of T-synthase after refolding. Our results support the hypothesis that Cosmc binds reversibly to non-native T-synthase and promotes its folding independent of other chaperones."
https://openalex.org/W1995079656,"The neuropeptide/hormone neurotensin (NT) mediates intestinal inflammation and cell proliferation by binding of its high affinity receptor, neurotensin receptor-1 (NTR1). NT stimulates IL-8 expression in NCM460 human colonic epithelial cells by both MAP kinase- and NF-κB-dependent pathways. Although the mechanism of NTR1 endocytosis has been studied, the relationship between NTR1 intracellular trafficking and inflammatory signaling remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we show that in NCM460 cells exposed to NT, β-arrestin-1 (βARR1), and β-arrestin-2 (βARR2) translocate to early endosomes together with NTR1. Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) degrades NT in acidic conditions, and its activity is crucial for NTR1 recycling. Pretreatment of NCM460 cells with the ECE-1 inhibitor SM19712 or gene silencing of βARR1 or βARR2 inhibits NT-stimulated ERK1/2 and JNK phosphorylation, NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation and phosphorylation, and IL-8 secretion. Furthermore, NT-induced cell proliferation, but not IL-8 transcription, is attenuated by the JNK inhibitor, JNK(AII). Thus, NTR1 internalization and recycling in human colonic epithelial cells involves βARRs and ECE-1, respectively. Our results also indicate that βARRs and ECE-1-dependent recycling regulate MAP kinase and NF-κB signaling as well as cell proliferation in human colonocytes in response to NT."

Recent studies have shown that NUAK1 is involved in cellular senescence and motility in epithelial cells and fibroblasts. However, the physiological roles of NUAK1 are poorly understood because of embryonic lethality in NUAK1 null mice. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the roles of NUAK1 in adult tissues. We determined the tissue distribution of NUAK1 and generated muscle-specific NUAK1 knock-out (MNUAK1KO) mice. For phenotypic analysis, whole body glucose homeostasis and muscle glucose metabolism were examined. Quantitative phosphoproteome analysis of soleus muscle was performed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the knock-out phenotype. Nuak1 mRNA was preferentially expressed in highly oxidative tissues such as brain, heart, and soleus muscle. On a high fat diet, MNUAK1KO mice had a lower fasting blood glucose level, greater glucose tolerance, higher insulin sensitivity, and higher concentration of muscle glycogen than control mice. Phosphoproteome analysis revealed that phosphorylation of IRS1 Ser-1097 was markedly decreased in NUAK1-deficient muscle. Consistent with this, insulin signaling was enhanced in the soleus muscle of MNUAK1KO mice, as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of IRS1 Tyr-608, AKT Thr-308, and TBC1D4 Thr-649. These observations suggest that a physiological role of NUAK1 is to suppress glucose uptake through negative regulation of insulin signaling in oxidative muscle.

AMPK is a heterotrimer composed of an α catalytic subunit and two regulatory subunits: β and γ. The AMPK-RK family includes 12 proteins classified together on the basis of sequence similarity with AMPKαs (1.Manning G. Whyte D.B. Martinez R. Hunter T. Sudarsanam S.

The phosphorylation and activation of AMPKαs are up-regulated by AMP through binding to the γ regulatory subunit (3.Scott J.W. Ross F.A. Liu J.K. Hardie D.G. Regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase by a pseudosubstrate sequence on the γ subunit.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 806-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AMPK-RKs do not have regulatory subunits; thus their activities are not directly regulated by the cellular AMP:ATP ratio (4.Al-Hakim A.K. Göransson O. Deak M. Toth R. Campbell D.G.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 5661-5673Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Like the AMPKαs and most other AMPK-RKs, NUAK1 can be phosphorylated by liver kinase B1 (LKB1) at a conserved threonine residue (corresponding to Thr-211 in NUAK1) (2.Lizcano J.M. Göransson O.

NUAK1 also acts as a transcriptional coactivator in complex with LKB1 and tumor suppressor p53 to induce cell cycle G1 arrest in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells (8.Hou X. Liu J.E. Liu W. Liu C.Y.

In mouse C2C12 myoblasts, NUAK1 is increasingly expressed with differentiation to myotubes (9.Niesler C.U. Myburgh K.H. Moore F.

Apart from these in vitro studies, a study involving knock-out mice showed that the mouse homolog of NUAK1 (OMPHK1) is essential for closure of the ventral body wall in developing embryos (10.Hirano M.

Kaminishi M. Esumi H. Strong association of ARK5 with tumor invasion and metastasis.J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2004; 23: 263-268PubMed Google Scholar). Overall, the functions and roles of NUAK1 have been investigated in the context of motility or proliferation of cultured cells, embryonic development, and cancer progression. However, little research has focused on the physiological roles of NUAK1 in adult tissues. Skeletal muscle is the major tissue responsible for disposal of total body glucose (12.DeFronzo R.A.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 15541-15546Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition to the influences on contraction-stimulated glucose uptake, muscle-specific LKB1 knock-out mice display increased insulin sensitivity and improved whole body glucose homeostasis (21.Koh H.J. Arnolds D.E. Fujii N. Tran T.T. Rogers M.J. Jessen N. Li Y. Liew C.W. Ho R.C. Hirshman M.F. Kulkarni R.N. Kahn C.R. Goodyear L.J. Skeletal muscle-selective knockout of LKB1 increases insulin sensitivity, improves glucose homeostasis, and decreases TRB3.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 8217-8227Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In contrast, muscle-specific inhibition of AMPKα2 impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance (22.Fujii N. Ho R.C. Manabe Y. Jessen N. Toyoda T. Holland W.L. Summers S.A. Hirshman M.F. Goodyear L.J. Ablation of AMP-activated protein kinase α2 activity exacerbates insulin resistance induced by high-fat feeding of mice.Diabetes. 2008; 57: 2958-2966Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Other than AMPKα2 and NUAK2, little is known about the involvement of other AMPK-RKs in muscle glucose metabolism. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the physiological roles of NUAK1 in adult tissues. For this purpose, we generated muscle-specific NUAK1 knock-out (MNUAK1KO) mice. To our knowledge, this is the first report of conditional knock-out of NUAK1. MNUAK1KO mice were apparently normal but exhibited improved glucose homeostasis under high fat diet (HFD) conditions. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the phenotype associated with the knock-out, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteome analysis of skeletal muscle. Our data suggest that one role of NUAK1 is suppression of insulin signal transduction in skeletal muscle. All of the experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Ethics Review Committee at the National Cancer Center. The mice were maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle and housed in a temperature-controlled barrier facility with free access to water and a standard rodent chow composed of 20% calories from fat, 50% calories from carbohydrate, and 30% calories from protein (CMF; Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan). Nuak1flox/flox mice were obtained from the Laboratory for Animal Resources and Genetic Engineering, Center for Developmental Biology, RIKEN Kobe (accession number CDB0555K). Prior to initiation of the present study, Nuak1flox/flox mice were backcrossed onto a C57BL/6J background using the speed cogenic method (Oriental Bioservice, Tokyo, Japan). To generate MNUAK1KO mice, Nuak1flox/flox mice were mated with muscle creatin kinase (Mck)-Cre mice (JAX, number 006475: B6.FVB (129S4)-Tg (Ckmm-cre) 5 Khn/J). As a control for MNUAK1KO mice, their Nuak1flox/flox littermate mice were used. For HFD-induced glucose intolerance, the mice were fed a HFD composed of 57% calories from fat, 23% calories from carbohydrate, and 20% calories from protein (HFD32; Clea Japan, Tokyo, Japan) starting from 5 weeks of age until the termination of the experiments. Male mice were used for all of the experiments. Genomic DNA from various tissues was subjected to PCR involving 34 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 60 °C for 30 s, and elongation at 72 °C for 90 s with the following primers: 5′-specific primer P1 (5′-GGTAGGTGGAGGTCGGCTGAGAAGG) and 3′-specific primer P2 (5′-TCGGATCCTAGTGAACCTCTTC). Total RNA was extracted using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) and quantified using a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Equal amounts (3.5 μg/15-μl reaction) of total RNA were subjected to first strand cDNA synthesis using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (GE Healthcare Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real time PCR was carried out with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Invitrogen Japan) and TaqMan gene expression assays (Invitrogen Japan) according to the manufacturer's protocols. The TaqMan gene expression assays used in this study were Nuak1 (Mm01250701_m1), Nuak2 (Mm00546961_m1), PGC-1α (Mm_01208835_m1), TNNC1 (Mm00437111_m1), TNNC2 (Mm00437116_m1), and 18 S rRNA (4319413E). For relative quantification, Ct values for each gene were normalized to those for 18 S rRNA. For absolute quantification, synthesized oligonucleotide DNA fragments (Sigma-Aldrich Japan) containing the PCR amplicon regions were used to generate standard curves. Following sacrifice, mouse tissues were rapidly dissected and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were homogenized in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich Japan) and then subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride microporous membrane (Millipore, MA). The primary antibodies used were: anti-NUAK1 (4458), anti-phospho-LKB1 Ser-428 (3482), anti-LKB1 (3047), anti-IRS1 (2382), anti-phospho-AKT Thr-308 (9275), and anti-AKT (4685), all obtained from Cell Signaling Technologies (Beverly, MA), anti-phospho-TBC1D4 Thr-642 (ab65753), and anti-glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) (ab65976), obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK), anti-TBC1D4 (07-741) and anti-phospho-IRS1 Tyr-608 (09-432), obtained from Millipore (Billerica, MA), and anti-actin (sc-1615), obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Immunoblots were scanned using a Canoscan LiDE60 image scanner (Cannon, Tokyo, Japan), and the intensities of the protein bands were quantified using an image processing program ImageJ 1.44. Blood glucose levels were measured from tail blood using an Antsense II glucometer (Bayer Medical, Tokyo, Japan). Plasma insulin levels were determined from peripheral blood using mouse insulin ELISA kit S-Type (Shibayagi, Gunma, Japan). The glycogen concentration of the soleus muscle was determined using a glycogen assay kit (BioVision, Milpitas, CA). For oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT), mice fasted overnight were administered glucose at a dose of 1 g/kg of body weight. Blood glucose levels were measured immediately before and 20, 40, 60, and 120 min after the administration. For insulin tolerance tests (ITT), mice fasted for 2 h were injected intraperitoneally with recombinant human insulin (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) at a dose of 1 unit/kg of body weight. Blood glucose levels were measured immediately before and 15, 30, and 60 min after the injection. Soleus muscles were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 6-μm thickness. The sections were stained using Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin and Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen Japan). The immunofluorescent images were visualized with a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal laser microscope (Carl Zeiss Japan). The myocyte cross-sectional areas obtained from 84 cells from six control mice and 83 cells from six MNUAK1KO mice were quantified by ZEN 2009 image viewer software (Carl Zeiss Japan). All of the incubation media were pregassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2, and all incubation was performed at 30 °C. Ex vivo muscle incubation was performed as described previously (23.Alkhateeb H. Chabowski A. Glatz J.F. Luiken J.F. Bonen A. Two phases of palmitate-induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Impaired GLUT4 translocation is followed by a reduced GLUT4 intrinsic activity.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2007; 293: E783-E793Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Soleus muscles were incubated for 30 min in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (KHB) (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm HEPES, 5.5 mm glucose, 2 mm pyruvate, and 0.05% free fatty acid free-bovine serum albumin without or with insulin (20 milliunits/ml). Subsequently, the muscles were washed with glucose-free KHB without or with insulin (20 milliunits/ml) three times. Glucose transport was then determined in KHB supplemented with 0.5 MBq/ml 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-d-glucose ([18F]FDG) (Nihon Medi-Physics, Tokyo, Japan), 0.75 mm FDG, and 9 μm mannitol in the absence or presence of insulin (20 milliunits/ml) for 20 min. [18F]FDG was washed out with ice-cold KHB without glucose and without insulin three times. Thereafter, the muscles were blotted and weighed. The remaining radioactivity derived from [18F]FDG was measured by a Wizard 2 automatic γ-counter (PerkinElmer Japan). Soleus muscles were frozen in liquid nitrogen and disrupted using a multibead shocker (MB400U; Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan). Homogenates of the muscles were reduced with dithiothreitol and then alkylated with iodoacetamide before being subjected to a dual enzymatic digestion (Lys-C followed by trypsin) (24.Saito H. Oda Y. Sato T. Kuromitsu J. Ishihama Y. Multiplexed two-dimensional liquid chromatography for MALDI and nanoelectrospray ionization mass spectrometry in proteomics.J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 1803-1807Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Digested samples were desalted using StageTips with SDB-XC Empore disk membranes (3M Company, St. Paul, MN) (25.Rappsilber J. Ishihama Y. Mann M. Stop and go extraction tips for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, nanoelectrospray, and LC/MS sample pretreatment in proteomics.Anal. Chem. 2003; 75: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Dimethyl labeling was performed according to the literature (26.Boersema P.J. Raijmakers R. Lemeer S. Mohammed S. Heck A.J. Multiplex peptide stable isotope dimethyl labeling for quantitative proteomics.Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 484-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar). Phosphopeptide enrichment based on hydroxy acid-modified metal oxide chromatography was performed using lactic acid-modified titania as described previously with a slight modification (27.Sugiyama N. Masuda T. Shinoda K. Nakamura A. Tomita M. Ishihama Y. Phosphopeptide enrichment by aliphatic hydroxy acid-modified metal oxide chromatography for nano-LC-MS/MS in proteomics applications.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2007; 6: 1103-1109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). The eluates from hydroxy acid-modified metal oxide chromatography were concentrated in a vacuum evaporator (CC-105; Tomy, Tokyo, Japan). NanoLC-MS/MS analysis was performed using a previously described setup (28.Nakagami H. Sugiyama N. Mochida K. Daudi A. Yoshida Y. Toyoda T. Tomita M. Ishihama Y. Shirasu K. Large-scale comparative phosphoproteomics identifies conserved phosphorylation sites in plants.Plant Physiol. 2010; 153: 1161-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Peptides and proteins were identified by Mascot version 2.3 (Matrix Science, Tokyo, Japan) against the Uniprot/SwissProt data base release 2011_04 with a precursor mass tolerance of 3 ppm, a fragment ion mass tolerance of 0.8 Da, and strict trypsin specificity allowing for up to two missed cleavages. Cysteine carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification. Oxidation of methionine, phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine, and [1H4,12C2/2H4,13C2]dimethylation of the N terminus and lysine were allowed as variable modifications. Peptides were considered identified if the Mascot score was over the 95% confidence limit based on the “identity” score of each peptide, and at least three successive y or b ions and two or more y, b, and/or precursor origin neutral loss ions were observed, based on the error-tolerant peptide sequence tag concept (29.Mann M. Wilm M. Error-tolerant identification of peptides in sequence databases by peptide sequence tags.Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 4390-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). False positive rates were estimated by searching against a randomized decoy data base created by the Mascot Perl program supplied by Matrix Science (averaged false positive rate = 1.02%). The details of experimental procedures are described in the supplemental information. To determine the tissue distribution of NUAK1, the level of mouse Nuak1 mRNA in various organs and tissues was measured using quantitative RT-PCR. The distribution of Nuak2 mRNA was also examined because NUAK1 and NUAK2 may have redundant functions (7.Zagórska A. Deak M. Campbell D.G. Banerjee S. Hirano M. Aizawa S. Prescott A.R. Alessi D.R. New roles for the LKB1-NUAK pathway in controlling myosin phosphatase complexes and cell adhesion.Sci. Signal. 2010; 3: ra25Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 30.Yamamoto H. Takashima S. Shintani Y. Yamazaki S. Seguchi O. Nakano A. Higo S. Kato H. Liao Y. Asano Y. Minamino T. Matsumura Y. Takeda H. Kitakaze M. Identification of a novel substrate for TNFα-induced kinase NUAK2.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2008; 365: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, Nuak1 was most abundant in the cerebrum and heart, which is consistent with the distribution of human NUAK1 (31.Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Ohara O. Prediction of the coding sequences of unidentified human genes. IX. The complete sequences of 100 new cDNA clones from brain which can code for large proteins in vitro.DNA Res. 1998; 5: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We found that among the skeletal muscles examined, Nuak1 was selectively expressed in the soleus, at a level comparable with the heart. In contrast, Nuak2 was barely detectable in the skeletal muscles and was highly expressed in kidney. Expression of NUAK1 protein in the heart, soleus, tibialis anterior (TA), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles was analyzed using immunoblotting, which also showed muscle type-specific expression of NUAK1 (Fig. 1B). LKB1 was expressed in all of the muscles examined, and the phosphorylation level was lower in the heart than in the other muscles (Fig. 1B). Previous studies have shown that soleus muscle predominantly contains type I and type IIA fibers, which have a high mitochondrial density and oxidative capacity (32.Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Signaling pathways in skeletal muscle remodeling.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data suggest that NUAK1 is preferentially expressed in highly oxidative tissues such as the cerebrum, heart, and soleus muscle. To investigate the role of NUAK1 in skeletal muscle, we generated conditional knock-out (MNUAK1KO) mice. Mice carrying Nuak1 floxed allele (Nuak1flox/flox), in which exon 3 was flanked by loxP sequences as shown in Fig. 1C, were crossed with muscle creatin kinase (Mck)-Cre transgenic mice. The MNUAK1KO mice were born in a normal Mendelian ratio and had no gross abnormalities in appearance and behavior. Genomic PCR analysis confirmed deletion of the Nuak1 gene in the heart and skeletal muscles of MNUAK1KO mice. The deletion was not observed in any nonmuscle tissues in the MNUAK1KO mice or in tissues from their Nuak1flox/flox (control) littermates (Fig. 1D). Real time RT-PCR showed that the level of Nuak1 mRNA was substantially reduced in heart, soleus, TA, and EDL muscles of MNUAK1KO mice (Fig. 1E). The NUAK1 protein was barely detectable in those tissues of MNUAK1KO mice (Fig. 1F). These observations confirmed that muscle-specific knock-out of NUAK1 was achieved. For phenotypic analysis, we first assessed the mass and fiber size of the soleus muscle, as well as the weight of heart and body, because the involvement of NUAK1 in myoblast differentiation has been implied (9.Niesler C.U. Myburgh K.H. Moore F. The changing AMPK expression profile in differentiating mouse skeletal muscle myoblast cells helps confer increasing resistance to apoptosis.Exp. Physiol. 2007; 92: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). No difference was observed between MNUAK1KO and control mice with respect to body, heart, or soleus weights under both normal chow diet (NC) and HFD conditions at 13–15 weeks of age (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Table S1). The myocyte cross-sectional area of the soleus muscle was almost identical in MNUAK1KO and control mice (Fig. 2C). The expression of NUAK1 in heart or soleus muscle of control mice was not affected by the HFD (data not shown). To determine whether NUAK1 is involved in the formation of type I fibers, we examined the expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1-α (PGC-1α), a transcriptional regulator that drives type I fiber formation (33.Lin J. Wu H. Tarr P.T. Zhang C.Y. Wu Z. Boss O. Michael L.F. Puigserver P. Isotani E. Olson E.N. Lowell B.B. Bassel-Duby R. Spiegelman B.M. Transcriptional co-activator PGC-1α drives the formation of slow-twitch muscle fibres.Nature. 2002; 418: 797-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar). We also assessed myofiber composition by examining the expression levels of troponin C1 (TNNC1) and troponin C2 (TNNC2), which are specifically expressed in type I and type II fibers, respectively (32.Bassel-Duby R. Olson E.N. Signaling pathways in skeletal muscle remodeling.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 19-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). Real time RT-PCR analysis revealed no significant difference between MNUAK1KO and control mice with respect to PGC-1α, TNNC1, or TNNC2 mRNA expression in the soleus, TA, and EDL muscles (Fig. 2, D–F). These observations suggest that NUAK1 is not involved in the determination of muscle mass, fiber size, or fiber type. To assess the influence of muscle-specific knock-out of NUAK1 on whole body glucose homeostasis, MNUAK1KO and control mice were fed either a NC or a HFD, and the level of blood glucose was monitored. There was no difference in the fasting blood glucose concentration of MNUAK1KO and control mice fed a NC through age 19 weeks (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, on a HFD, the fasting blood glucose concentration at 13–15 weeks of age was significantly lower in MNUAK1KO mice than in control mice (Fig. 3A). This phenotype was even more prominent by age 18–19 weeks (Fig. 3B). At this age, MNUAK1KO mice fed a HFD exhibited slightly lower body weight compared with that of control mice (supplemental Tabl"
https://openalex.org/W2106762442,"We investigated whether overexpression of AMP-metabolizing enzymes in intact cells would modulate oligomycin-induced AMPK activation. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were transiently transfected with increasing amounts of plasmid vectors to obtain a graded increase in overexpression of AMP-deaminase (AMPD) 1, AMPD2, and soluble 5'-nucleotidase IA (cN-IA) for measurements of AMPK activation and total intracellular adenine nucleotide levels induced by oligomycin treatment. Overexpression of AMPD1 and AMPD2 slightly decreased AMP levels and oligomycin-induced AMPK activation. Increased overexpression of cN-IA led to reductions in the oligomycin-induced increases in AMP and ADP concentrations by ∼70 and 50%, respectively, concomitant with a 50% decrease in AMPK activation. The results support the view that a rise in ADP as well as AMP is important for activation of AMPK, which can thus be regulated by the adenylate energy charge. The control coefficient of cN-IA on AMP was 0.3-0.7, whereas the values for AMPD1 and AMPD2 were <0.1, suggesting that in this model cN-IA exerts a large proportion of control over intracellular AMP. Therefore, small molecule inhibition of cN-IA could be a strategy for AMPK activation."
https://openalex.org/W2033027278,"CpG DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic modifications playing a role in the control of gene expression. For DNA viruses whose genome has the ability to integrate in the host genome or to maintain as a latent episome, a correlation has been found between the extent of DNA methylation and viral quiescence. No information is available for Parvovirus B19, a human pathogenic virus, which is capable of both lytic and persistent infections. Within Parvovirus B19 genome, the inverted terminal regions display all the characteristic signatures of a genomic CpG island; therefore we hypothesised a role of CpG dinucleotide methylation in the regulation of viral genome expression. The analysis of CpG dinucleotide methylation of Parvovirus B19 DNA was carried out by an aptly designed quantitative real-time PCR assay on bisulfite-modified DNA. The effects of CpG methylation on the regulation of viral genome expression were first investigated by transfection of either unmethylated or in vitro methylated viral DNA in a model cell line, showing that methylation of viral DNA was correlated to lower expression levels of the viral genome. Then, in the course of in vitro infections in different cellular environments, it was observed that absence of viral expression and genome replication were both correlated to increasing levels of CpG methylation of viral DNA. Finally, the presence of CpG methylation was documented in viral DNA present in bioptic samples, indicating the occurrence and a possible role of this epigenetic modification in the course of natural infections. The presence of an epigenetic level of regulation of viral genome expression, possibly correlated to the silencing of the viral genome and contributing to the maintenance of the virus in tissues, can be relevant to the balance and outcome of the different types of infection associated to Parvovirus B19."
https://openalex.org/W1994275281,"Expansion into new host niches requires bacterial pathogens to adapt to changes in nutrient availability and to evade an arsenal of host defenses. Horizontal acquisition of Salmonella Pathogenicity Island (SPI)-2 permitted the expansion of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium into the intracellular environment of host cells by allowing it to deliver bacterial effector proteins across the phagosome membrane. This is facilitated by the SsrA-SsrB two-component regulatory system and a type III secretion system encoded within SPI-2. SPI-2 acquisition was followed by evolution of existing regulatory DNA, creating an expanded SsrB regulon involved in intracellular fitness and host infection. Here, we identified an SsrB-regulated operon comprising an ABC transporter in Salmonella. Biochemical and structural studies determined that the periplasmic solute-binding component, STM1633/DalS, transports D-alanine and that DalS is required for intracellular survival of the bacteria and for fitness in an animal host. This work exemplifies the role of nutrient exchange at the host-pathogen interface as a critical determinant of disease outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2030174760,"Previously, an efficient d-xylose utilizing Pseudomonas putida S12 strain was obtained by introducing the d-xylose isomerase pathway from Escherichia coli, followed by evolutionary selection. In the present study, systemic changes associated with the evolved phenotype were identified by transcriptomics, enzyme activity analysis, and inverse engineering. A key element in improving the initially poor d-xylose utilization was the redistribution of 6-phospho-d-gluconate (6-PG) between the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the oxidative pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. This redistribution increased the availability of 6-PG for oxidative decarboxylation to d-ribose-5-phosphate, which is essential for the utilization of d-xylose via the nonoxidative PP pathway. The metabolic redistribution of 6-PG was procured by modified HexR regulation, which in addition appeared to control periplasmic sugar oxidation. Because the absence of periplasmic d-xylonate formation was previously demonstrated to be essential for achieving a high biomass yield on d-xylose, the aberrant HexR control appeared to underlie both the improved growth rate and biomass yield of the evolved d-xylose utilizing P. putida strain. The increased oxidative PP pathway activity furthermore resulted in an elevated NADH/NAD+ ratio that caused the metabolic flux to be redirected from the TCA cycle to the glyoxylate shunt, which was also activated transcriptionally. Clearly, these findings may serve as an important case in point to engineer and improve the utilization of non-natural carbon sources in a wide range of industrial microorganisms.

https://openalex.org/W1985772566,"The Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV; or human herpesvirus-8)-encoded protein called K-bZIP (also named K8) was found to be multifunctional. In this study, we discovered that K-bZIP interacts with histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1/2 in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-stimulated BCBL-1 lymphocyte cells. K-bZIP appears to repress HDAC activity through this interaction, which we determined to be independent of K-bZIP SUMOylation. We dissected the domains of K-bZIP and found that the leucine zipper (LZ) domain is essential for the interaction of K-bZIP and HDAC. In addition, we constructed a KSHV bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) with LZ domain-deleted K-bZIP (KSHVdLZ) and transfected this mutated KSHV BAC DNA into HEK 293T cells. As a result, it was consistently found that K-bZIP without its LZ domain failed to interact with HDAC2. We also showed that the interaction between K-bZIP and HDAC is necessary for the inhibition of the lytic gene promoters (ORF50 and OriLyt) of KSHV by K-bZIP. Furthermore, we found that the LZ domain is also important for the interaction of K-bZIP with the promoters of ORF50 and OriLyt. Most interestingly, although it was found to have suppressive effects on the promoters of ORF50 and OriLyt, KSHVdLZ replicates at a significantly lower level than its BAC-derived revertant (KSHVdLZRev) or KSHVWT (BAC36) in HEK 293T cells. The defectiveness of KSHVdLZ replication can be partially rescued by siRNA against HDAC2. Our results suggest that the function of K-bZIP interaction with HDAC is two-layered. 1) K-bZIP inhibits HDAC activity generally so that KSHVdLZ replicates at a lower level than does KSHVWT. 2) K-bZIP can recruit HDAC to the promoters of OriLyt and ORF50 through interaction with HDAC for K-bZIP to have a temporary repressive effect on the two promoters.

Methods We investigated 150 volunteers to determine if the association between high tHcy and cerebral grey matter volume and cognitive function is independent of cardiovascular disease. Results Participants with high tHcy (≥15 µmol/L) showed a widespread relative loss of grey matter compared with people with normal tHcy, although differences between the groups were minimal once the analyses were adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, hypertension, smoking and prevalent cardiovascular disease. Individuals with high tHcy had worse cognitive scores across a range of domains and less total grey matter volume, although these differences were not significant in the adjusted models. Conclusions Our results suggest that the association between high tHcy and loss of cerebral grey matter volume and decline in cognitive function is largely explained by increasing age and cardiovascular diseases and indicate that the relationship is not causal."
https://openalex.org/W1996593294,"c-Met, the tyrosine-kinase receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, plays a critical role in the tumorigenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the underlying mechanism remains incompletely understood. The mature c-Met protein p190Met(αβ) (consists of a α subunit and a β subunit) is processed from pro-Met. Here we show that pro-Met is processed into p190Met(NC) by sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor thapsigargin. p190Met(NC) compensates for the degradation of p190Met(αβ) and protects human HCC cells from apoptosis mediated by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In comparison with p190Met(αβ), p190Met(NC) is not cleaved and is expressed as a single-chain polypeptide. Thapsigargin-initiated p190Met(NC) expression depends on the disturbance of ER calcium homeostasis. Once induced, p190Met(NC) is activated independent of hepatocyte growth factor engagement. p190Met(NC) contributes to sustained high basal activation of c-Met downstream pathways during ER calcium disturbance-mediated ER stress. Both p38 MAPK-promoted glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) expression and sustained high basal activation of PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK are involved in the cytoprotective function of p190Met(NC). Importantly, the expression of p190Met(NC) is detected in some HCC cases. Taken together, these data provide a potential mechanism to explain how c-Met promotes HCC cells survival in response to ER stress. We propose that context-specific processing of c-Met protein is implicated in HCC progression in stressful microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W2116773242,"The activation of coagulation factors V and X by Russell's viper venom (RVV) has been implicated in the development of consumptive coagulopathies in severely envenomed patients. However, factor Va is prone to inactivation by activated protein C (APC), an important serine protease that negatively regulates blood coagulation. It is therefore hypothesized that APC may be down-regulated by some of the venom components. In this study, we managed to isolate a potent Kunitz-type APC inhibitor, named DrKIn-I. Using chromogenic substrate, DrKIn-I dose-dependently inhibited the activity of APC. Heparin potentiated the inhibition and reduced the IC(50) of DrKIn-I by 25-fold. DrKIn-I, together with heparin, also protected factor Va from APC-mediated inactivation. Using surface plasmon resonance, DrKIn-I exhibited fast binding kinetics with APC (association rate constant = 1.7 × 10(7) M(-1) s(-1)). Direct binding assays and kinetic studies revealed that this inhibition (K(i) = 53 pM) is due to the tight binding interactions of DrKIn-I with both heparin and APC. DrKIn-I also effectively reversed the anticoagulant activity of APC and completely restored the thrombin generation in APC-containing plasma. Furthermore, although the injection of either DrKIn-I or RVV-X (the venom factor X-activator) into ICR mice did not significantly deplete the plasma fibrinogen concentration, co-administration of DrKIn-I with RVV-X resulted in complete fibrinogen consumption and the deposition of fibrin thrombi in the glomerular capillaries. Our results provide new insights into the pathogenesis of RVV-induced coagulopathies and indicate that DrKIn-I is a novel APC inhibitor that is associated with potentially fatal thrombotic complications in Russell's viper envenomation."
https://openalex.org/W2131790102,"Background The cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa is one of the principal bloom-forming cyanobacteria present in a wide range of freshwater ecosystems. M. aeruginosa produces cyanotoxins, which can harm human and animal health. Many metabolic pathways in M. aeruginosa, including photosynthesis and microcystin synthesis, are controlled by its circadian rhythms. However, whether xenobiotics affect the cyanobacterial circadian system and change its growth, physiology and biochemistry is unknown. We used real-time PCR to study the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on the expression of clock genes and some circadian genes in M. aeruginosa during the light/dark (LD) cycle. Results The results revealed that H2O2 changes the expression patterns of clock genes (kaiA, kaiB, kaiC and sasA) and significantly decreases the transcript levels of kaiB, kaiC and sasA. H2O2 treatment also decreased the transcription of circadian genes, such as photosynthesis-related genes (psaB, psbD1 and rbcL) and microcystin-related genes (mcyA, mcyD and mcyH), and changed their circadian expression patterns. Moreover, the physiological functions of M. aeruginosa, including its growth and microcystin synthesis, were greatly influenced by H2O2 treatment during LD. These results indicate that changes in the cyanobacterial circadian system can affect its physiological and metabolic pathways. Conclusion Our findings show that a xenobiotic can change the circadian expression patterns of its clock genes to influence clock-controlled gene regulation, and these influences are evident at the level of cellular physiology."
https://openalex.org/W2035973222,"The gap junction-forming connexin (Cx) 50 is truncated gradually during lens development. Premature cleavage of lens connexins is thought to be associated with cataract formation. We have shown previously that Cx50 is likely to be cleaved by caspase-3 like protease during chick lens development. Here, using HPLC-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, we mapped two cleavage sites at the C terminus of Cx50 after Glu-368 and Asp-379 and identified caspase-3 and caspase-1 as the responsible proteases, respectively. The activity of caspase-1, like caspase-3, was detected in the outer cortex increased during lens development, which coincided with the accumulation of the truncated fragments of Cx50 in the core region of the lens. The truncated Cx50 fragments present in older lenses were reproduced in the younger lens after treatment with UV radiation; this cleavage could be partially blocked by caspase-1/3-specific inhibitors. Interestingly, as compared with full-length Cx50, caspase-truncated Cx50 showed a dramatic decrease in gap junction coupling and a loss of hemichannel function. Furthermore, expression of caspase-truncated Cx50 fragments increased cell viability against UV radiation as compared with full-length Cx50. Together, these results suggest that both caspase-1 and -3 are responsible for the cleavage at the C terminus of Cx50 during lens development. The reduction of gap junction coupling and closure of hemichannels formed by truncated Cx50 are likely to adaptively protect cells against elevated oxidative stress associated with lens aging.

The primary function of the lens, an avascular organ, is to transmit light and focus it on the retina. The lens is composed of an anterior epithelial cell layer and fiber cells that form the bulk of the organ. Epithelial cells differentiate into fiber cells, accompanied by cell elongation and organelle loss; this differentiation process continues throughout the lifespan of the organism. Lens fiber cells do not turnover throughout the lifespan of the animal and rely on a large network of intercellular gap junction communications between fiber cells and cells at the lens surface for the exchange of metabolites and ions (1Cooper K. Mathias R.T. Rae J.L. Peracchia C. Biophysics of Gap Junction Channels. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1991: 57-64Google Scholar). Gap junctions are clusters of transmembrane channels between two adjacent cells that allow the passage of small molecules (molecular mass = 1 kDa), such as ions, metabolites, and second massagers (2Goodenough D.A. Goliger J.A. Paul D.L. Connexins, connexons, and intercellular communication.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 475-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The structural units of gap junction channels are a family of proteins called connexins, which contains >20 members expressed in an overlapping, tissue-dependent pattern (3Meşe G. Richard G. White T.W. Gap junctions: Basic structure and function.J. Invest. Dermatol. 2007; 127: 2516-2524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Each connexin has four conserved transmembrane domains and two extracellular loops in which their cytoplasmic regions are variable, especially the C-terminal domain. Connexins expressed in most of the other tissues are highly dynamic proteins that undergo rapid turnover both in cell lines and in animal organs; their degradation has been shown to involve either the lysosome or the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (4Musil L.S.

Three connexins, Cx43, Cx46, and Cx50, have been identified in the vertebrate lens. Cx43 is mainly expressed in anterior epithelial cells and the lens bow region. Cx43 is down-regulated and replaced by the other two lens fiber connexins, Cx50 and Cx46, during differentiation of epithelial cells to new lens fibers (10Gong X. Cheng C. Xia C. Connexins in lens development and cataractogenesis.J. Membr. Biol. 2007; 218: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cx50 plays an important role in maintenance of lens transparency and in normal lens development and epithelial fiber differentiation (11White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L.

In contrast to connexins in other organs, lens fiber connexins, like lens fibers, also do not turnover during the lifespan of the lens. Cx50 and Cx46 proteins are truncated gradually during lens development. Truncated connexin fragments accumulate in the center core regions of the lens (9Yin X. Gu S. Jiang J.X.

Phosphorylation and truncation sites of bovine lens connexin 46 and connexin 50.Exp. Eye Res. 2009; 89: 898-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the C-terminal domain of Cx50 has been reported to result in a dramatic decrease of junctional conductance (17DeRosa A.M. Mui R. Srinivas M. White T.W. Functional characterization of a naturally occurring Cx50 truncation.Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 4474-4481Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In one report, truncation at the Cx50 C terminus was found to cause a loss of pH sensitivity (16Xu X. Berthoud V.M. Beyer E.C. Ebihara L. Functional role of the carboxyl terminal domain of human connexin 50 in gap junctional channels.J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 186: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), but the results of another study indicated that pH sensitivity only was reduced partially after C-terminal truncation of Cx50 (19Stergiopoulos K. Alvarado J.L. Mastroianni M. Ek-Vitorin J.F. Taffet S.M. Delmar M. Hetero-domain interactions as a mechanism for the regulation of connexin channels.Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1144-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, until now, the biological function of truncation of Cx50 in the lens was largely unknown. Proteolysis plays very important roles in many aspects of lens development. It has been suggested that the loss of all cytoplasmic organelles during the differentiation of epithelial cells to lens fiber cells resembles apoptosis to a certain degree (20Bassnett S. Mataic D. Chromatin degradation in differentiating fiber cells of the eye lens.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Transcripts for each executioner caspases, caspase-1, -3, -6, and -7, have been identified in lens fibers although endogenous proteolytic activity has only been reported for caspase-3 (21Zandy A.J. Lakhani S. Zheng T. Flavell R.A. Bassnett S. Role of the executioner caspases during lens development.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30263-30272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Until now, the mechanistic role of caspase activation in the lens has not been elucidated clearly. Therefore, it is of interest to understand the molecular targets of caspases activated during lens development. The eye lens is constantly exposed to UV radiation, which produces reactive oxygen species (22Bergamini C.M. Gambetti S. Dondi A. Cervellati C. Oxygen, reactive oxygen species, and tissue damage.Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1611-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The elevated oxidative stress that results from UV radiation has also been observed in older lens (23Berthoud V.M. Beyer E.C. Oxidative stress, lens gap junctions, and cataracts.Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2009; 11: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) and is considered to be one of the major factors leading to the development of age-dependent cataracts (24Ayala M.N. Michael R. Söderberg P.G. In vivo cataract after repeated exposure to ultraviolet radiation.Exp. Eye Res. 2000; 70: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 25Zigman S. Datiles M. Torczynski E. Sunlight and human cataracts.Invest. Ophthalmol Vis. Sci. 1979; 18: 462-467PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that Cx50 is a likely target of a caspase-3-like protease (9Yin X. Gu S. Jiang J.X. The development-associated cleavage of lens connexin 45.6 by caspase-3-like protease is regulated by casein kinase II-mediated phosphorylation.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34567-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, specific natural truncation sites of Cx50 were identified, and both caspase-1 and caspase-3 were determined as the major enzymes responsible for the cleavage of Cx50 in vivo. Furthermore, similar truncations were observed in younger lenses after exposure to UV radiation, along with increased activity of caspase-1/3. Importantly, as compared with full-length Cx50, we showed that truncation of Cx50 enhanced cell resistance against UV radiation. Fertilized, incubated white Leghorn chicken eggs were purchased from Ideal Poultry (Cameron, TX) and incubated in a humidified incubator. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), and the annexin V and propidium iodide (PI) staining kit from Clontech (Mountain View, CA). The anti-Cx50 antibody against the intracellular loop domain was generated as described previously (9Yin X. Gu S. Jiang J.X.

Chem. 2001; 276: 34567-34572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The polyclonal anti-caspase-1 antibody was purchased from Invitrogen, and polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibody was from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Caspase-1- and caspase-3-specific inhibitors and a Caspase Colorimetric Assay kit were purchased from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Hyclone laboratories (Logan, UT). Tissue culture reagents, Lucifer yellow (LY) and rhodamine dextran (RD) were from Invitrogen. Cell proliferation reagent WST-1 was purchased from Roche Applied Science (Mannheim, Germany). All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma or Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Three-month-old chick lenses were collected and rinsed three times in PBS. Membrane proteins were prepared following the procedure described previously (9Yin X. Gu S. Jiang J.X.

Briefly, chicken lenses were lysed and pelleted at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the crude membrane pellet was washed two times with prechilled 20 mm NaOH. Proteins were separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Bands of interest were excised, and the proteins were digested in situ with trypsin (Promega, modified). The digests were analyzed by capillary HPLC-electrospray ionization-MS/MS on a Thermo Fisher LTQ fitted with a New Objective PicoView 550 nanospray interface. Online HPLC separation was accomplished with an Eksigent NanoLC micro-HPLC: column, PicoFritTM (New Objective; 75-μm inner diameter) packed to 11 cm with C18 adsorbent (Vydac; 218MSB5, 5 μm, 300 Å); mobile phase A, 0.5% acetic acid (HAc)/0.005% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); mobile phase B, 90% acetonitrile/0.5% HAc/0.005% TFA; gradient, 2% to 42% B in 60 min; flow rate, 0.4 μl/min. MS conditions were as follows: electrospray ionization voltage, 2.9 kV; isolation window for MS/MS, 3; relative collision energy, 35%; scan strategy, survey scan followed by acquisition of data-dependent collision-induced dissociation spectra of the seven most intense ions in the survey scan above a set threshold. Mascot (Matrix Science) was used to search the uninterpreted collision-induced dissociation spectra searched against the Swiss-Prot database. Methionine oxidation was considered as a variable modification, with semi-trypsin as the proteolytic enzyme specificity. The Mascot search results were imported into Scaffold (Proteome Software), and a second search was then conducted within Scaffold by X! Tandem. The assignments were compiled and further processed by PeptideProphet and ProteinProphet for determination of the probabilities of peptide assignments and protein identifications. The reported peptide assignments were all ≥ the peptide 95% confidence level. Retroviral constructs and high-titer RCAS(A) retroviruses were prepared based on the protocol described previously (26Jiang J.X. Bruzzone R. Giaume C. Connexin Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 159-174Google Scholar). With the wild-type RCAS(A)-Cx50 DNA construct as a template, other Cx50 mutants and truncated Cx50 were generated by using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used were as follows: Cx50(D379A), 5′-CTGAACTTGCCACCGCGGTGAGATCCCTCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGAGGGATCTCACCGCGGTGGCAAGTTCAG-3′ (antisense); Cx50(E368A), 5′-TGAGCGATGAAGTGGCAGGGCCTTCAGCAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTGCTGAAGGCCCTGCCACTTCATCGCTCA-3′ (antisense); Cx50(D365A), 5′-ACGTGGTGAGCGCTGAAGTGGAAGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCTTCCACTTCAGCGCTCACCACCT-3′ (antisense); Cx50(368T), 5′-GATGAAGTGGAATGACCTTCAGCACCTG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CAGGTGCTGAAGGTCATTCCACTTCATC-3′ (antisense); and Cx50(379T), 5′-CTTGCCACCGATTGAAGATCCCTCAGCAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGCTGAGGGATCTTCAATCGGTGGCAAG-3′ (antisense). With the Cx50(E368A) DNA construct as a template, the Cx50(E368A,D379A) mutant was generated. The primers used were as follows: 5′-CTGAACTTGCCACCGCGGTGAGATCCCTCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGAGGGATCTCACCGCGGTGGCAAGTTCAG-3′ (antisense). All constructs were sequenced at the University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Institutional DNA Sequencing Facility. The high-titer retroviruses (1–5 × 108 colony forming units/ml) containing wild-type and mutants were prepared as described previously (26Jiang J.X. Bruzzone R. Giaume C. Connexin Methods and Protocols. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 159-174Google Scholar). Frozen sections prepared from postnatal day 1 chick lens were washed three times with PBS for 5 min each and were then incubated with blocking solution containing 2% normal goat serum, 2% fish skin gelatin, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Polyclonal anti-caspase-1 (1:200 dilution) or anti-caspase-3 (1:200 dilution) antibody in blocking solution was then added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. Sections were washed three times with PBS for 5 min each and then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:750) for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes for 5 min each in PBS, sections were then incubated with DAPI (1:20,000 dilution) in PBS for 5 min at room temperature. Sections were then washed with PBS for 5 min and mounted on a coverslip with mounting medium. The specimens were analyzed using by fluorescence microscopy (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan). CEF cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells in 60-mm tissue culture plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) plus 10% fetal calf serum, 2% chick serum, and 5% sodium pyruvate. Cells were infected on the second day with high-titer retroviruses (>1 × 108 colony-forming units/μl, 15–20 μl/plate). After reaching confluence, CEF cells were digested with 0.05% trypsin and plated into 35- or 60-mm culture plates. To prepare for lens organ cultures, intact lenses were isolated from chick embryo at day 12 and washed with PBS three times. Chick lens was incubated in M199 medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2. GST fusion proteins containing a portion of the C-terminal region of Cx50 (F1, residues 307–389) and its corresponding mutant Cx50F1(D379A) were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by binding to glutathione-coupled agarose beads according to published procedures (27Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Molecular cloning and functional characterization of chick lens fiber connexin 45.6.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, embryonic day 12 chick lens or CEF cells infected with recombinant retroviruses were lysed in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA/EGTA) plus 2 mm PMSF, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 100 μm leupeptin. The crude membrane extract was pelleted at 50,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C (Beckman TLA 100.3 rotor). The GST fusion protein (150–200 ng) or membrane extract was subjected to enzymatic digestion with caspase-1 or caspase-3 in the absence or presence of corresponding caspase-specific inhibitors (caspase-1 inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CHO, 0.05 μg/μl; caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, 0.05 μg/μl). The cleavage reaction was performed in 20 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm sucrose, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol) with or without 50 units of caspase-1 or caspase-3 for different time periods. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5x electrophoresis sample buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and 35% glycerol) and boiling for 5 min. Dephosphorylation of the crude membrane extract was performed according to a published protocol (27Jiang J.X. White T.W. Goodenough D.A. Paul D.L. Molecular cloning and functional characterization of chick lens fiber connexin 45.6.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 363-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100–500 μg of protein from the chick lens membrane extract was dissolved in 1× New England Biolab buffer 3 and incubated with 7.5 units of alkaline phosphatase at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The reaction was terminated by addition of 5x sample buffer and then boiling for 5 min. The activities of caspase-1 and caspase-3 were measured according to the protocol provided in the Caspase Colorimetric Assay kit (EMD Chemicals) with minor modifications. Briefly, supernatants of lysates prepared from CEF cells or chick lenses were incubated with caspase-1-specific substrate (Ac-YAVD-pNA) or caspase-3 specific substrate (Ac-DEVD-pNA) in reaction buffer at 37 °C for 6 h. Caspase activities were determined using a microtiter plate reader to assess absorbance at 405 nm. Values were normalized based on the total protein in each sample. The dye uptake assay was performed as described previously (28Cherian P.P. Siller-Jackson A.J. Gu S. Wang X. Bonewald L.F. Sprague E. Jiang J.X. Mechanical strain opens connexin 43 hemichannels in osteocytes: A novel mechanism for the release of prostaglandin.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3100-3106Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, CEF cells expressing exogenous Cx50 or mutants generated by retroviral infection or RCAS(A) vehicle-infected control cells were grown at low cell density to minimize physical contact among the cells. LY (457 Da) was used as a tracer to determine hemichannel activity; RD (10 kDa) was employed as a negative control. Cells were washed with Ca2+-free minimum essential medium three times and then mechanically stimulated to induce the opening of hemichannels by dropping Ca2+-free MEM from a pipette at a fixed distance. Then, cells were incubated in the presence of 0.4% LY plus 0.4% RD for 5 min. Cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer and fixed in 2% PFA. Dye uptake was calculated as the percentage of fluorescent cells divided by the total number of cells. Scrape-loading dye transfer was performed according to the published procedure (29el-Fouly M.H. Trosko J.E. Chang C.C. Scrape-loading and dye transfer. A rapid and simple technique to study gap junctional intercellular communication.Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 168: 422-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, CEF cells expressing exogenous Cx50 and its mutants were grown to confluence to maximize physical contact. Cells were washed five times with Hanks' balanced salt solution plus 1% BSA for 3 min each and then scraped lightly with a 26.5-gauge needle in the presence of 1% LY and 1% RD dissolved in PBS. After incubation for 30 min, cells were washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution five times, 3 min each time, and then cells were fixed in 2% PFA for 30 min. Dye transfer results were measured with a fluorescence microscope in which LY and RD were detected by using fluorescein and RD filters. Acquisition conditions were kept consistent for all measurements, and no threshold adjustments were applied. The extent of dye transfer was quantified by measuring the ratio of the LY transfer distance from the scrape lines to the RD transfer distance. CEF cells expressing Cx50 and mutants or RCAS(A) vehicle control as described above were seeded at 5 × 104 cells in a 96-well plate in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum, 2% chick serum, 5% sodium pyruvate and were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. Cells were then treated with 200 mJ/cm2 UV radiation (254 nm, Fisher Biotech FBUV XL-1000 Microprocessor Controlled UV Crosslinker) and then cultured in 100 μl of fresh medium for another 18 h. Live cells were stained with WST-1 reagent according to the procedure provided by the manufacture. Briefly, 10 μl of WST-1 reagent was added to each well, and then cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After vigorous shaking, a microplate reader was used to measure the absorbance of the samples at 450 nm immediately before UV treatment and 18 h after exposure. Values for cell viability were calculated as the percentage of absorbance at 18 h after UV exposure divided by the absorbance before treatment. CEF cells expressing Cx50 and mutants or RCAS(A) vehicle control were seeded at 8 × 105 cells in 60-mm dishes in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum, 2% chick serum, and 5% sodium pyruvate and cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 and grown to confluence. Cells were then treated with 200 mJ/cm2 UV radiation (254 nm, Fisher Biotech FBUV XL-1000 Microprocessor Controlled UV Cross-linker) and then cultured in 3 ml of fresh medium for another 18 h. Flow cytometry analysis was performed subsequently according to the protocol provided in the kit. Briefly, cells were trypsinized and gently washed once with serum-containing media, then rinsed with 1× binding buffer. Cells (0.1–1 × 106) were resuspended in 200 μl of 1× binding buffer. Five microliters of annexin V and 10 μl of PI were added, and then cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min in the dark. Binding buffer was used to bring the reaction volume to 500 μl, and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (LSR-II, high-speed, multicolor, digital analyzer, BD Biosciences). The signal generated by annexin V was detected in the FITC signal channel, and the signal generated by PI was monitored by the detector for phycoerythrin emission. All data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism software (version 5.04, GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA). A paired Student's t test was used for comparison between two groups, and one-way analysis of variance followed by a Student Newman Keul's test were used for comparison of more than two groups. Unless otherwise specified in the figure legends, the data are presented as the mean ± S.E. of at least three determinations. Asterisks indicate the degree of significant differences (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). To investigate the development-associated truncation of Cx50, membrane extracts isolated from chick lenses at embryonic days 8, 12, 15, and 18 and postnatal days 1 and 60 were immunoblotted with an anti-Cx50 antibody that recognizes the intracellular loop domain of Cx50. For optimal comparison of the truncated fragments of Cx50, we adjusted protein loading to make sure that the level of full-length Cx50 was comparable at different time points. Full-length Cx50 and its phosphorylated forms have molecular masses ∼55 kDa. A lower molecular mass fragment that migrated ∼49 kDa was detected, starting at embryonic day 8, gradually decreasing in quantity, whereas two smaller fragments ∼45 kDa appeared at embryonic day-12 becoming predominant since embryonic day 18 (Fig. 1§). These data suggest that truncation of Cx50 gradually increases concomitant with lens development. Based on the predicted sizes of these fragments, the cleavage sites are likely to be located at the intracellular C-terminal domain of Cx50. To locate the potential truncation sites of lens Cx50, mass spectrometry analyses were conducted of tryptic digests of Cx50 protein isolated from chick lenses. Based o"
https://openalex.org/W1964665588,"In view of the inverse temporal relationship of central clock activity to physiological or behavioral outputs in diurnal and nocturnal species, understanding the mechanisms and physiological consequences of circadian disorders in humans would benefit from studies in a diurnal animal model, phylogenetically close to humans. Here we report the discovery of the first intrinsic circadian disorder in a family of diurnal non-human primates, the rhesus monkey. The disorder is characterized by a combination of delayed sleep phase, relative to light-dark cycle, mutual desynchrony of intrinsic rhythms of activity, food intake and cognitive performance, enhanced nighttime feeding or, in the extreme case, intrinsic asynchrony. The phenotype is associated with normal length of intrinsic circadian period and requires an intact central clock, as demonstrated by an SCN lesion. Entrainment to different photoperiods or melatonin administration does not eliminate internal desynchrony, though melatonin can temporarily reinstate intrinsic activity rhythms in the animal with intrinsic asynchrony. Entrainment to restricted feeding is highly effective in animals with intrinsic or SCN lesion-induced asynchrony. The large isolated family of rhesus macaques harboring the disorder provides a powerful new tool for translational research of regulatory circuits underlying circadian disorders and their effective treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2069862441,"Defensins are important molecules in the innate immune system that eliminate infectious microbes. They also exhibit cytotoxicity against host cells in higher concentrations. The mechanisms by which hosts protect their own cells from cytotoxicity of defensins have been poorly understood. We found that the cytotoxicity of human β-defensin 3 (hBD3) against lung epithelial cells was dose-dependently attenuated by pulmonary surfactant protein A (SP-A), a collectin implicated in host defense and regulation of inflammatory responses in the lung. The direct interaction between SP-A and hBD3 may be an important factor in decreasing this cytotoxicity because preincubation of epithelial cells with SP-A did not affect the cytotoxicity. Consistent with in vitro analysis, intratracheal administration of hBD3 to SP-A(-/-) mice resulted in more severe tissue damage compared with that in WT mice. These data indicate that SP-A protects lung epithelium from tissue injury caused by hBD3. Furthermore, we found that the functional region of SP-A lies within Tyr(161)-Lys(201). Synthetic peptide corresponding to this region, tentatively called SP-A Y161-G200, also inhibited cytotoxicity of hBD3 in a dose-dependent manner. The SP-A Y161-G200 is a candidate as a therapeutic reagent that prevents tissue injury during inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2081347365,"Approach or avoidance behaviors are accompanied by perceptual vigilance for, affective reactivity to and behavioral predisposition towards rewarding or punitive stimuli, respectively. We detected three subpopulations of C57BL/6J mice that responded with avoiding, balancing or approaching behaviors not induced by any experimental manipulation but spontaneously displayed in an approach/avoidance conflict task. Although the detailed neuronal mechanisms underlying the balancing between approach and avoidance are not fully clarified, there is growing evidence that endocannabinoid system (ECS) plays a critical role in the control of these balancing actions. The sensitivity of dorsal striatal synapses to the activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors was investigated in the subpopulations of spontaneously avoiding, balancing or approaching mice. Avoiding animals displayed decreased control of CB1 receptors on GABAergic striatal transmission and in parallel increase of behavioral inhibition. Conversely, approaching animals exhibited increased control of CB1 receptors and in parallel increase of explorative behavior. Balancing animals reacted with balanced responses between approach and avoidance patterns. Treating avoiding animals with URB597 (fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitor) or approaching animals with AM251 (CB1 receptor inverse agonist) reverted their respective behavioral and electrophysiological patterns. Therefore, enhanced or reduced CB1-mediated control on dorsal striatal transmission represents the synaptic hallmark of the approach or avoidance behavior, respectively. Thus, the opposite spontaneous responses to conflicting stimuli are modulated by a different involvement of endocannabinoid signaling of dorsal striatal neurons in the range of temperamental traits related to individual differences."
https://openalex.org/W2041554964,"Megalencephalic leukoencephalopathy with subcortical cysts (MLC, MIM# 604004) is an autosomal recessive inherited disease mostly resulting from MLC1 mutations. In this study, we finished the functional analysis of MLC1 mutations identified recently in Chinese patients, including five newly described missense mutations (R22Q, A32V, G73E, A275T, Y278H), one known nonsense mutation (Y198X), and two known missense mutations (S69L, T118M). We found MLC1wt was localized to the cell periphery, whereas mutant R22Q, A32V, G73E, S69L and T118M were trapped in the lumen of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) when we transfected the wild-type and mutant MLC1 in U373MG cells. Compared to wild type, the mutant G73E, T118M, Y198X and A275T transcript decreased and all mutants except R22Q had lower protein expression in transfected U373MG cells. Therefore, we propose that all these eight MLC1 mutations had functional effect either on their protein/mRNA expression, or on their intracellular protein localization, or both."
https://openalex.org/W2123416257,"To investigate the rise of economic abilities during development we studied children aged between 3 and 10 in an exchange situation requiring them to calculate their investment based on different offers. One experimenter gave back a reward twice the amount given by the children, and a second always gave back the same quantity regardless of the amount received. To maximize pay-offs children had to invest a maximal amount with the first, and a minimal amount with the second. About one third of the 5-year-olds and most 7- and 10-year-olds were able to adjust their investment according to the partner, while all 3-year-olds failed. Such performances should be related to the rise of cognitive and social skills after 4 years."
