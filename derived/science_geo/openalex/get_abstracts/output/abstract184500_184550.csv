It is determined by probability P , being maximal at P = 0.5 and decreasing at higher and lower probabilities. Using distinct stimuli to indicate the probability of reward, we found that the phasic activation of dopamine neurons varied monotonically across the full range of probabilities, supporting past claims that this response codes the discrepancy between predicted and actual reward. In contrast, a previously unobserved response covaried with uncertainty and consisted of a gradual increase in activity until the potential time of reward. The coding of uncertainty suggests a possible role for dopamine signals in attention-based learning and risk-taking behavior."

The electron transfer turnover rate of the reconstituted bioelectrocatalyst is approximately 5000 per second, compared with the rate at which molecular oxygen, the natural cosubstrate of the enzyme, accepts electrons (approximately 700 per second). The gold nanoparticle acts as an electron relay or ""electrical nanoplug"" for the alignment of the enzyme on the conductive support and for the electrical wiring of its redox-active center."
https://openalex.org/W2103419911,"The Polycomb group (PcG) protein Eed is implicated in regulation of imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in extraembryonic cells but not of random X inactivation in embryonic cells. The Drosophila homolog of the Eed-Ezh2 PcG protein complex achieves gene silencing through methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3-K27), which suggests a role for H3-K27 methylation in imprinted X inactivation. Here we demonstrate that transient recruitment of the Eed-Ezh2 complex to the inactive X chromosome (Xi) occurs during initiation of X inactivation in both extraembryonic and embryonic cells and is accompanied by H3-K27 methylation. Recruitment of the complex and methylation on the Xi depend on Xist RNA but are independent of its silencing function. Together, our results suggest a role for Eed-Ezh2-mediated H3-K27 methylation during initiation of both imprinted and random X inactivation and demonstrate that H3-K27 methylation is not sufficient for silencing of the Xi."

The structural basis of ClC channel gating was studied. Crystal structures of wild-type and mutant Escherichia coli ClC channels bound to a monoclonal Fab fragment reveal three Cl- binding sites within the 15-angstrom neck of an hourglass-shaped pore. The Cl- binding site nearest the extracellular solution can be occupied either by a Cl- ion or by a glutamate carboxyl group. Mutations of this glutamate residue in Torpedo ray ClC channels alter gating in electrophysiological assays. These findings reveal a form of gating in which the glutamate carboxyl group closes the pore by mimicking a Cl- ion."
https://openalex.org/W2171005590,"Gibberellin (GA) regulates growth and development in plants. We isolated and characterized a rice GA-insensitive dwarf mutant, gid2. The GID2 gene encodes a putative F-box protein, which interacted with the rice Skp1 homolog in a yeast two-hybrid assay. In gid2, a repressor for GA signaling, SLR1, was highly accumulated in a phosphorylated form and GA increased its concentration, whereas SLR1 was rapidly degraded by GA through ubiquitination in the wild type. We conclude that GID2 is a positive regulator of GA signaling and that regulated degradation of SLR1 is initiated through GA-dependent phosphorylation and finalized by an SCF(GID2)-proteasome pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2088126475,"The manufacture of high-performance, conjugated polymer transistor circuits on flexible plastic substrates requires patterning techniques that are capable of defining critical features with submicrometer resolution. We used solid-state embossing to produce polymer field-effect transistors with submicrometer critical features in planar and vertical configurations. Embossing is used for the controlled microcutting of vertical sidewalls into polymer multilayer structures without smearing. Vertical-channel polymer field-effect transistors on flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate) substrates were fabricated, in which the critical channel length of 0.7 to 0.9 micrometers was defined by the thickness of a spin-coated insulator layer. Gate electrodes were self-aligned to minimize overlap capacitance by inkjet printing that used the embossed grooves to define a surface-energy pattern."
https://openalex.org/W1985503871,"Onshore sediment transport and sandbar migration are important to the morphological evolution of beaches but are not well understood. Here, a model that accounts for fluid accelerations in waves predicts the onshore sandbar migration observed on an ocean beach. In both the observations and the model, the location of the maximum acceleration-induced transport moves shoreward with the sandbar, resulting in feedback between waves and morphology that drives the bar shoreward until conditions change. A model that combines the effects of transport by waves and mean currents simulated both onshore and offshore bar migration observed over a 45-day period."
https://openalex.org/W2001923189,"Increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by mitochondria is involved in oxidative damage to the organelle and in committing cells to apoptosis or senescence, but the mechanisms of this increase are unknown. Here we show that ROS production by mitochondrial complex I increases in response to oxidation of the mitochondrial glutathione pool. This correlates with thiols on the 51- and 75-kDa subunits of complex I forming mixed disulfides with glutathione. Glutathionylation of complex I increases superoxide production by the complex, and when the mixed disulfides are reduced, superoxide production returns to basal levels. Within intact mitochondria oxidation of the glutathione pool to glutathione disulfide also leads to glutathionylation of complex I, which correlates with increased superoxide formation. In this case, most of this superoxide is converted to hydrogen peroxide, which can then diffuse into the cytoplasm. This mechanism of reversible mitochondrial ROS production suggests how mitochondria might regulate redox signaling and shows how oxidation of the mitochondrial glutathione pool could contribute to the pathological changes that occur to mitochondria during oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2002678450,"Lake Victoria harbors a unique species-rich flock of more than 500 endemic haplochromine cichlid fishes. The origin, age, and mechanism of diversification of this extraordinary radiation are still debated. Geological evidence suggests that the lake dried out completely about 14,700 years ago. On the basis of phylogenetic analyses of almost 300 DNA sequences of the mitochondrial control region of East African cichlids, we find that the Lake Victoria cichlid flock is derived from the geologically older Lake Kivu. We suggest that the two seeding lineages may have already been lake-adapted when they colonized Lake Victoria. A haplotype analysis further shows that the most recent desiccation of Lake Victoria did not lead to a complete extinction of its endemic cichlid fauna and that the major lineage diversification took place about 100,000 years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2009602793,"Recent morphological and molecular evidence has changed interpretations of arthropod phylogeny and evolution. Here we compare complete mitochondrial genomes to show that Collembola, a wingless group traditionally considered as basal to all insects, appears instead to constitute a separate evolutionary lineage that branched much earlier than the separation of many crustaceans and insects and independently adapted to life on land. Therefore, the taxon Hexapoda, as commonly defined to include all six-legged arthropods, is not monophyletic."
https://openalex.org/W2010575361,"There are two types of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in the cerebral cortex. Fast inhibition is mediated by ionotropic γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A ) receptors, and slow inhibition is due to metabotropic GABA B receptors. Several neuron classes elicit inhibitory postsynaptic potentials through GABA A receptors, but possible distinct sources of slow inhibition remain unknown. We identified a class of GABAergic interneurons, the neurogliaform cells, that, in contrast to other GABA-releasing cells, elicited combined GABA A and GABA B receptor–mediated responses with single action potentials and that predominantly targeted the dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons. Slow inhibition evoked by a distinct interneuron in spatially restricted postsynaptic compartments could locally and selectively modulate cortical excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2035937362,Local circuits in the spinal cord that generate locomotion are termed central pattern generators (CPGs). These provide coordinated bilateral control over the normal limb alternation that underlies walking. The molecules that organize the mammalian CPG are unknown. Isolated spinal cords from mice lacking either the EphA4 receptor or its ligand ephrinB3 have lost left-right limb alternation and instead exhibit synchrony. We identified EphA4-positive neurons as an excitatory component of the locomotor CPG. Our study shows that dramatic locomotor changes can occur as a consequence of local genetic rewiring and identifies genes required for the development of normal locomotor behavior.
https://openalex.org/W1969540020,"Glucose homeostasis is a function of glucose supply, transport across the plasma membrane, and metabolism. To monitor glucose dynamics in individual cells, a glucose nanosensor was developed by flanking the Escherichia coli periplasmic glucose/galactose-binding protein with two different green fluorescent protein variants. Upon binding of substrate the FLIPglu-170n sensor showed a concentration-dependent decrease in fluorescence resonance energy transfer between the attached chromophores with a binding affinity for glucose of 170 nm. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements with different sugars indicated a broad selectivity for monosaccharides. An affinity mutant with a Kd of approximately 600 microM was generated, which showed higher substrate specificity, and thus allowed specific monitoring of reversible glucose dynamics in COS-7 cells in the physiological range. At external glucose concentrations between 0.5 and 10 mM, reflecting typical blood levels, free cytosolic glucose concentrations remained at approximately 50% of external levels. The removal of glucose lead to reduced glucose levels in the cell, demonstrating reversibility and visualizing homeostasis. Glucose levels dropped even in the presence of the transport inhibitor cytochalasin B, indicating rapid metabolism. Consistently, the addition of 2-deoxyglucose, which is not recognized by the sensor, affects glucose uptake and metabolism rates. Within the physiological range, glucose utilization, i.e. hexokinase activity, was not limiting. Furthermore, the results show that in COS-7 cells, cytosolic glucose concentrations can vary over at least two orders of magnitude. The glucose nanosensor provides a novel tool with numerous scientific, medical, and environmental applications."
https://openalex.org/W2025256619,"Mechanical unfolding trajectories for single molecules of the Tetrahymena thermophila ribozyme display eight intermediates corresponding to discrete kinetic barriers that oppose mechanical unfolding with lifetimes of seconds and rupture forces between 10 and 30 piconewtons. Barriers are magnesium dependent and correspond to known intra- and interdomain interactions. Several barrier structures are ""brittle,"" breakage requiring high forces but small (1 to 3 nanometers) deformations. Barrier crossing is stochastic, leading to variable unfolding paths. The response of complex RNA structures to locally applied mechanical forces may be analogous to the responses of RNA during translation, messenger RNA export from the nucleus, and viral replication."
https://openalex.org/W2072259101,"Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are emerging as a new class of anticancer agents for the treatment of solid and hematological malignancies. Although HDAC inhibitors induce cell death through an apoptotic process, little is known about the molecular events that control their effectiveness. In this study, we demonstrate that HDAC inhibitors are limited in their ability to induce apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines despite their ability to effectively inhibit deacetylase activity. Because the anti-apoptotic transcription factor NF-κB has been shown to be under the control of HDAC-mediated repression, we analyzed whether HDAC inhibitors activated NF-κB in NSCLC cells. HDAC inhibitors effectively stimulated endogenous NF-κB-dependent gene expression by up-regulating IL-8, Bcl-XL, and MMP-9 transcripts. The ability of HDAC inhibitors to increase NF-κB transcriptional activity was not associated with signaling events that stimulated nuclear translocation, but rather modulated the transactivation potential of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB. The inhibition of HDAC activity was associated with the recruitment of the p300 transcriptional co-activator to chromatin in an Akt-dependent manner. Moreover, Akt directly phosphorylated p300 in vitro and was required for stimulating the transactivation potential of the co-activator following the addition of HDAC inhibitors. Selective inhibition of either the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, or NF-κB itself blocked the ability of HDAC inhibitors to activate NF-κB and dramatically sensitized NSCLC cells to apoptosis following of the addition of HDAC inhibitors. Our study indicates that the ineffectiveness of HDAC inhibitors to induce apoptosis in NSCLC cancer cells is associated with the ability of these molecules to stimulate NF-κB-dependent transcription and cell survival.

The loss of HDAC activity results in diminished methylation-associated gene silencing and hyperacetylation of core histones, transcription factors, and proteins involved in transcription (1Vigushin D.M. Coombes R.C. Anticancer Drugs. 2002; 13: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 2Marks P. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Breslow R. Miller T. Kelly W.K. Nat. Rev.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3110-3115Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Because transient acetylation of core histones has been shown to be a critical prerequisite for chromatin remodeling and gene transcription (6Kuo M.-H. Allis C.D. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 615-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 7Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6448) Google Scholar), HDAC inhibitors would be predicted to promote cell cycle transition and proliferation. Paradoxically, the loss of deacetylase activity following the addition of HDAC inhibitors has been shown to inhibit proliferation and to stimulate differentiation and apoptosis in transformed cells in vitro and in vivo (1Vigushin D.M. Coombes R.C. Anticancer Drugs. 2002; 13: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 3Cairns B.R.

This idea is supported by the fact that several of the class I HDAC molecules have been shown to be overexpressed in hematological and solid cancers, including lung cancer (8Warrell Jr., R.P. He L.Z.

Moreover, oncogenic mutations or fusions involving retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X receptor greatly increase the affinity of HDAC-containing complexes, thus promoting the development of promyelocytic leukemias (1Vigushin D.M. Coombes R.C. Anticancer Drugs. 2002; 13: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 3Cairns B.R.

Therefore, the maintenance of an HDAC activity may provide a survival and growth advantage to some types of cancers (12Kwon H.J. Owa T. Hassig C.A. Shimada J. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3356-3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence, a number of structurally different HDAC inhibitors are being evaluated as novel anti-neoplastic agents to treat solid and hematological malignancies (4Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Rifkind R.A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 1210-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). To date, the precise molecular mechanisms governing the cellular response and effectiveness of HDAC inhibitors are poorly understood and remain areas of intense research. The transcriptional activity of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), like many immediate early transcription factors, is regulated through acetylation (13Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). NF-κB is an inducible transcription factor that plays a role in the expression of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, adhesion, cell cycle, and survival (14Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 15Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M55-M62PubMed Google Scholar, 16Joyce D. Albanese C. Steer J. Fu M. Bouzahzah B. Pestell R.G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2001; 12: 73-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Classic NF-κB, composed of a p50 and RelA/p65 heterodimer, is the most abundant form of NF-κB in cells. In unstimulated cells, the IκB inhibitor is physically associated with NF-κB, thus blocking nuclear translocation; however, upon cellular stimulation, IκB is phosphorylated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (17Ghosh S. Karin M. Genes Dev. 2002; 109: S81-S96Google Scholar). Once phosphorylated, IκB is ubiquitinated and degraded by the 26 S proteasome, allowing NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus to transcriptionally activate gene targets (14Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5515) Google Scholar, 15Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M55-M62PubMed Google Scholar, 16Joyce D. Albanese C. Steer J.

In addition to phosphorylating IκB, IKK is also responsible for directly phosphorylating serine 536 within the transactivation domain of the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB (18Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). Multiple laboratories, including our own, have shown that a variety of inducers of NF-κB transcriptional activity, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1)β, and the Ha-Ras oncoprotein activates NF-κB through pathways involving phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Akt, and IKK (19Sizemore N.

Although the exact mechanisms of how Akt stimulates the transactivation domain of RelA/p65 is not completely understood, IL-1β has been shown to activate pathways involving Akt, the histone acetyl transferases (HATs), p300 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 (25Madrid L.V.

In addition to recruiting HAT activity, NF-κB also plays a role in chromatin remodeling by recruiting the ATP-dependent SWI/SNF complex (36Utley R.T. Cote J. Owen-Hughes T. Workman J.L. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 2001; 277: 111-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Besides acetylating the N-terminal tails of core histones surrounding NF-κB-regulated genes (38Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), HATs are also responsible for acetylating RelA/p65 directly (13Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been proposed that acetylation of the RelA/p65 subunit is responsible for sustaining NF-κB-dependent transcription (13Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1653-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). In addition to co-activators, RelA/p65 has also been shown to recruit co-repressor complexes that are believed to basally or actively repress NF-κB-dependent transcription. To date, three members of the HDAC class I family of proteins have been shown to modulate NF-κB transcriptional activity, HDAC-1, -2, and -3 (39Ashburner B.P. Westerheide S.D. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mol.

HDACs are tethered to NF-κB, in part, through their interaction with steroid mediator repressor of transcription or nuclear co-repressor (41Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K.

Therefore, the differential association of NF-κB with co-activator and co-repressor proteins would be predicted to have profound consequences on many cellular processes, including transcription and cell survival. Work from our laboratory and others have established that NF-κB provides an anti-apoptotic function in many different cancer cell lines (15Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1470: M55-M62PubMed Google Scholar), including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (43Jones D.R. Broad R.M. Madrid L.V. Baldwin A.S. Mayo M.W. Ann. Thorac.

NSCLC, which constitutes over 80% of all newly diagnosed lung cancer, is extremely resistant to chemotherapeutic agents (45Schiller J.H. Harrington D. Belani C.P. Langer C. Sandler A. Krook J. Zhu J. Johnson D.H. New Engl. J. Med. 2002; 346: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (4735) Google Scholar). Thus, novel treatment strategies are clearly needed for this deadly disease. Currently, there are several Phase I and II clinical trials involving the use of HDAC inhibitors to treat patients with lymphoma and advanced solid tumors, including lung cancer (8Warrell Jr., R.P.

Because NF-κB has been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by pathways involving deacetylase-mediated repression (13Chen L. Fischle W. Verdin E. Greene W.C.

Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar), and because we have previously shown that NF-κB provides a cell survival role in NSCLC cells, studies were undertaken to determine if NSCLC cells were susceptible to apoptotic pathways induced by HDAC inhibition. In this report, we present evidence that the pro-apoptotic action of HDAC inhibitors is blunted by their ability to stimulate NF-κB gene expression in an Akt-dependent manner. Our work supports the hypothesis that the inhibition of HDAC activity modulates NF-κB transcription through mechanisms involving Akt-dependent phosphorylation of p300, recruitment of p300 to chromatin, and modulation of transactivation potential of this co-activator complex. Inhibition of NF-κB nuclear translocation or transcriptional activity significantly increased apoptosis in NSCLC cells following the addition of HDAC inhibitors. To our knowledge, we report herein the first evidence that NF-κB provides a significant protective role against HDAC inhibitor-mediated apoptosis and suggest that a combined molecular targeting that inhibits both NF-κB and HDAC activities may provide a significant anti-neoplastic therapy for patients with NSCLC and, potentially, other malignancies. Cell Culture, Reagents, and Plasmid Constructs—Human NSCLC lines (NCI-H157, NCI-H358, and NCI-A549) were obtained from the ATCC and grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone Laboratories, Logan, UT) and penicillin/streptomycin. The 3x-κB luciferase (3x-κB-Luc) reporter construct contains NF-κB DNA binding consensus sites originally identified in the major histocompatibility complex class I promoter, fused upstream to firefly luciferase (49Mayo M.W. Norris J.L. Baldwin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding FLAG-tagged p65 were previously described (50Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Baldwin A.S. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). The Gal-4 luciferase construct (Gal4-Luc) contains four Gal-4 DNA consensus binding sites, derived from the yeast GAL-4 gene promoter, cloned upstream of luciferase cDNA. The Gal4-p65 fusion protein has the yeast Gal-4 DNA-binding domain fused to the transactivation domain (TAD) 1 of RelA/p65-(521–551) and was previously described (51Schmitz M.L. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3805-3817Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Gal4-p300 and the GST-p300 fusion proteins containing various segments of p300 were previously described (52See R.H. Calvo D.

Expression plasmids encoding dominant negative Akt (K → A) have been described previously (27Madrid L. Wang C.-Y. Guttridge D.C. Schottelius A.J.G. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Mayo M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1626-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The IκBα (C-21) antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The p65- and p300-specific antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY), the RNA polymerase II antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the M2 FLAG-epitope tag and α-tubulin (T9026) antibodies were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Phosphospecific antibodies to Akt(S473) and pan-Akt antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Sodium butyrate and trichostatin A (TSA) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Histone Deacetylase Assays—NSCLC cells, plated in 100-mm dishes 18 h prior to the start of the experiments, were left untreated or were cultured in the presence of either TSA (500 nm) or sodium butyrate (1 μm). Eighteen hours following the addition of HDAC inhibitors, cells were harvested and nuclear extracts were isolated using previously described protocols (43Jones D.R. Broad R.M. Madrid L.V. Baldwin A.S. Mayo M.W. Ann. Thorac. Surg. 2000; 70: 930-936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 49Mayo M.W. Norris J.L. Baldwin A.S. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Nuclear protein samples were quantitated using the Pierce BCA protein assay dye reagent (Pierce, Rockford, IL). Extracts (50 μg) were analyzed for HDAC activity using the histone deacetylase kit from BIOMOL (Plymouth Meeting, PA) as directed by the manufacturer. To ensure that the deacetylase activity observed in untreated cells was due to Class I and II HDAC-mediated activity, TSA was also added to nuclear extracts in vitro. Although not shown, all HDAC activity, observed in untreated NSCLC cells (Fig. 1A), was inhibited in vitro by the addition of TSA. Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—NSCLC cells at 40–60% confluency were transiently transfected using Polyfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, plasmid constructs (0.75–1 μg of DNA/well of a 12-well plate) were diluted in serum-free media and mixed with the Polyfect reagent (4 μl/well). Complexes were allowed to form for 10 min before the addition of complete media containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were washed once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and Polyfect-DNA complexes were added to the cells and placed in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Six hours following the start of transfection, additional complete media containing the appropriated pharmacological agent for the experimental conditions were added to the cells. Twenty-four hours post transfection, cells were washed once with 1× PBS and lysed in luciferase reporter buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were then rapidly frozen and thawed in liquid nitrogen and a 37 °C water bath, respectively. Extracts were collected and cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. Protein concentrations were determined with the Pierce BCA protein assay dye reagent. Luciferase assays were performed using the substrate d-Luciferin, and relative light units were measured using an AutoLumat LB953 luminometer (Berthold Analytical Instruments). Luminescence was normalized to protein concentrations. Adenovirus Infection—Ad-CMV and Ad-SRIκBα is a replication-defective E1-deleted adenovirus expressing transgenes under the control of the CMV promoter. Recombinant SR-IκBα adenovirus was constructed as previously described (50Guttridge D.C. Mayo M.W. Madrid L.V. Wang C.Y. Baldwin A.S. Science. 2000; 289: 2363-2366Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Adenovirus was amplified in 293 cells and purified by banding in a cesium chloride density gradient. NSCLC cells (∼60% confluent) were infected with 100 plaque-forming units/cell in complete media overnight. Eighteen hours later media was replaced with fresh complete media alone or containing HDAC inhibitors. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays and Western Blot Analysis— Preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and EMSAs were performed as described previously (43Jones D.R. Broad R.M. Madrid L.V.

Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear extracts were prepared at indicated times and incubated with [32P]dCTP-labeled, double-stranded probe containing an NF-κB consensus site from the class I major histocompatibility complex promoter. Labeled probe/nuclear complexes were incubated for 10 min at room temperature and separated on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. Subsequently, the gel was dried and exposed to x-ray film. Western blot analysis was performed by either analyzing 0.25 m Tris-HCl lysed cell extracts or cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Total protein (50 μg) was separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH). The indicated primary antibodies were incubated for 30 min, washed, and visualized by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL chemiluminescent reagents (Amersham Biosciences, Piscat-away, NJ). Northern Blot Analysis—Logarithmically growing NSCLC cells were either left alone or were treated with HDAC inhibitors for 18 h. Twenty-four hours later, cells were either left alone (“No Add” in figures) or treated with HDAC inhibitors. Total RNAs were isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). RNAs (15 μg/lane) were resolved on a denaturing 1.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and crossed-linked. Gene expression was determined by analyzing Northern blots with 32P-labeled random probes generated from IL-8, Bcl-XL, MMP-9, or GAPDH cDNAs, and blots were hybridized with radiolabeled probes in Quickhyb (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). After a 2-h hybridization, the blots were washed twice in 2× SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min at room temperature and twice in 0.1× SSC/0.1% SDS for 15 min at 60 °C. Northern blots were analyzed by autoradiography. Caspase-3 and Apoptosis Assays—NSCLC cells, plated at 5 × 105 cells per well in a six-well plate the night before, were left alone or treated with various HDAC inhibitors. After 24 h of incubation with HDAC inhibitors, cells were harvested, and the extent of apoptosis was determined by quantitation of nucleosomes released into the cytoplasm using the Cell Death Detection ELISA Plus kit (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's directions. Caspase-3 assays were performed as previously described (44Jones D.R. Broad R.M. Comeau L.D. Parsons S.J. Mayo M.W. J. Thorac. Cardiovasc.

The resulting cellular morphology can be viewed as a high-internal phase polymeric emulsion. Compared with traditional blending procedures, this process reduces the percolation threshold for electrical conductivity by a factor of 10, increases the conductivity by several orders of magnitude, and simultaneously improves thermal stability. Following this route, new applications can be envisaged for semiconducting polymer blends that require only minimal concentrations of doped pi-conjugated polymer."

The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor Flk-1/KDR is responsible for the VEGF-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) production from endothelial cells. Cellular mechanisms mediating the negative regulation of Flk-1 signaling in endothelial cells have not been investigated. Here we show that Flk-1 is rapidly down-regulated following VEGF stimulation of bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs).

Ubiquitination of RTKs targets them for degradation; we demonstrate that activation of Flk-1 by VEGF leads to its polyubiquitination in BAECs. Furthermore, VEGF stimulation of BAECs or COS-7 cells transiently transfected with Flk-1 results in the phosphorylation of the ubiquitin ligase Cbl, the enhanced association of Cbl with Flk-1, and the relocalization of Cbl to vesicular structures in BAECs. Overexpression of Cbl in COS-7 cells enhances VEGF-induced ubiquitination of Flk-1, whereas a Cbl mutant lacking the ubiquitin ligase RING finger domain, 70Z/3-Cbl, does not. Moreover, expression of Cbl in contrast to 70Z/3-Cbl inhibits the Flk-1-dependent activation of eNOS and, thus, NO release. In BAEC overexpressing Cbl, the degradation of Flk-1 upon VEGF stimulation is accelerated compared with cells transfected with a control vector (green fluorescent protein). Our findings demonstrate that Flk-1 is rapidly down-regulated following sustained VEGF stimulation and identify Cbl as a negative regulator of Flk-1 signaling to eNOS.

In particular, concomitant activation of phospholipase C-γ and the PI3-kinase/Akt pathways by VEGF leads to an increase in intracellular calcium and the phosphorylation of Ser1179 of the bovine form of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) by Akt (Ser1177 in the human form).

Substantial amounts of data describe the receptorial components necessary for VEGF-mediated activation of Flk-1; however, little is known about factors mediating down-regulation or negative regulation of Flk-1 signaling. One of the mechanisms by which growth factor responses are negatively regulated is through ligand-stimulated degradation of the receptors. Several RTKs, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), and the colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1), are actively degraded following sustained exposure to their respective ligands. Degradation of RTKs is mainly initiated by the addition of ubiquitin moieties following receptor engagement, which has been show to target them to the lysosomal/proteasomal machinery for degradation (18Ettenberg S.A.

Ubiquitination of substrates requires three concerted steps for the conjugation of ubiquitin molecules to a substrate protein. Initially, the ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) forms a thiol ester bond with the carboxy-terminal glycine of ubiquitin. Then the ubiquitin molecule is transferred to an ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (also known as ubiquitin-carrier enzyme or E2), again involving the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin. The final step involves an ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzyme that complexes with the substrate and catalyzes the transfer from E2 to the ϵ-amino group of a lysine residue on the target protein (22Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). The multi-adaptor protein Cbl has been shown to possess E3 ligase activity and, thus, has been implicated in the ubiquitination of activated EGFR, PDGFR, and other RTKs (19Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Druker B. Band H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7927-7932Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 23Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B.

The demonstration of a prominent and inducible association of Cbl with the EGFR coupled to the observation that Cbl overexpression induced EGFR and PDGFR ubiquitination confirmed Cbl as a regulatory component of RTK function. The Flk-1 receptor has been shown to internalize upon VEGF stimulation (24Dougher M. Terman B.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of VEGF-dependent down-regulation of this important and essential component of vascular integrity has never been investigated. In this study, we demonstrate that sustained VEGF stimulation of endothelial cells results in Flk-1 protein down-regulation. This results in impaired eNOS activation and NO release during subsequent VEGF challenges. Consistent with the VEGF-stimulated degradation of Flk-1, we demonstrate that VEGF stimulates ubiquitination of Flk-1 and that Cbl mediates this effect through its ubiquitin ligase activity. Finally, we also demonstrate that Cbl negatively regulates Flk-1 signaling and VEGF-induced NO release. Our results identify Cbl as a novel component in the negative regulation of VEGF signaling. Cell Culture—Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2.0 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.

Veillette (Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal), and HA-ubiquitin (pcMV) was obtained from Dr. S. Meloche (Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Montréal). COS-7 cells were transfected in either 6-well plates or 60-mm dishes and transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). BAECs were transfected in 60-mm dishes using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics) as described previously (26Kovala A.T. Harvey K.A. McGlynn P. Boguslawski G. Garcia J.G. English D. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 2486-2494Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The pEGFP-N3 expression plasmid (Clontech) was used for the assessment of transfection efficiency as well as for plasmid control in BAEC transfections. Cell stimulations were done 48 h following transfections, and protein expression was confirmed (60 μg of total cell lysate) by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Nitric Oxide Release—BAECs were serum starved for 12 h and processed for the measurement of nitrite (NO2−), the stable breakdown product of NO in aqueous solution, by NO-specific chemiluminescence as described previously (27Sessa W.C. Garcia-Cardena G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples containing NO2− were refluxed in glacial acetic acid containing sodium iodide. Under these conditions, NO2− is quantitatively reduced to NO, which was quantified by a chemiluminescence detector after reaction with ozone in a NO analyzer (Sievers, Boulder, CO). Transfected COS-7 cells were also processed for the measurement of nitrite. 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with VEGF for 2 h, and NO was quantified as described above. Antibodies, Immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting—Flk-1 (monoclonal antibody), Cbl (polyclonal antibody) and ubiquitin (polyclonal antibody) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-eNOS antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. HA-tag, phospho-Akt (Ser473), total Akt, and phospho-eNOS (Ser1179) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling, and phospho-tyrosine (4G10) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Serum-starved BAECs (16 h) were washed twice with cold PBS following VEGF stimulation. Total cells lysates were prepared in some cases by directly adding to the dishes boiling SDS sample buffer. For immunoprecipitations, cells were solubilized with a lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm Pefabloc, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics). Insoluble proteins were precipitated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were then incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (2 μg) at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) (50 μl of a 50% slurry) was then added and incubated for an additional hour. The immune complexes were precipitated by centrifugation, washed three times with lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and separated by SDS-PAGE onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences) and Western blotted as described (28Gratton J.P. Morales-Ruiz M. Kureishi Y. Fulton D. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30359-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Antibody detection was performed by a chemiluminescence-based detection system (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Ubiquitination Assay—COS-7 cells were transfected with a maximum of 1.6 μg of total DNA encoding for Flk-1, HA-tagged ubiquitin, Cbl, and 70Z-Cbl. Unstimulated and VEGF-stimulated cells were washed twice in cold PBS. Cells were lysed for 30 min in buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 125 mm NaCl, 10 mmN-ethylmaleimide, 20 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm Pefabloc, and a protease inhibitor mixture. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described above. Immunofluorescence—BAECs were cultured on 0.1% gelatin-coated cover slips. Serum-starved cells were stimulated for 30 min with VEGF (50 ng/ml). Cells were then washed briefly with cold PBS and fixed for 15 min in PBS containing 3% paraformaldehyde. Cells were rinsed with PBS and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton in PBS for 5 min. Fixed cells were blocked with 1% BSA and then incubated for 1 h with the primary antibodies in 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS (mouse anti-Flk-1 (1:200) and rabbit anti-Cbl (1:200)). Bound primary antibodies were visualized following 1 h of incubation using Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse (1:600) and Alexa Fluor 568-labeled goat anti-rabbit (1:600) (Molecular Probes). Mounted cover slips were observed using a Zeiss LSM 510 imaging system. VEGF Pretreatment Inhibits Subsequent VEGF Signaling to eNOS—Ligand-dependent down-regulation of receptors has been shown previously for several RTKs; interestingly, VEGF-dependent down-regulation of Flk-1 signaling has not been investigated. To document VEGF-dependent desensitization of Flk-1 receptor signaling in endothelial cells, we studied the effect of VEGF (50 ng/ml) pretreatment on subsequent VEGF (50 ng/ml)-stimulated NO release from bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). Fig. 1A shows that VEGF pretreatment resulted in a time-dependent reduction of VEGF-stimulated NO production. The 30- and 60-min pretreatments completely abolished any subsequent VEGF-stimulated NO production from BAEC (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate the specificity of this VEGF pretreatment, ATP (10 μm) or ionomycin (1 μm) were used as stimuli for NO production (Fig. 1B). A 30-min pretreatment with VEGF (50 ng/ml) did not affect stimulated NO release by either agonist. These results indicate that the reduced responses of BAECs to VEGF are specific to the down-regulation of the Flk-1 receptor. To further document the VEGF inhibition of NO production, we monitored the impact of a 30-min VEGF pretreatment on Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 and on eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1179 stimulated by a second VEGF stimulation (Fig. 1C). As expected, the 30-min pretreatment with VEGF abolished any further increase in Akt and eNOS phosphorylation following a 10-min VEGF stimulation of cells. Serum (10% fetal bovine serum)-dependent activation of Akt was not affected by VEGF pretreatment (data not shown). Interestingly, in these experiments Flk-1 protein levels were monitored, and VEGF pretreatment significantly down-regulated the expression levels of Flk-1, which could be responsible for the impaired response to further VEGF stimulation. VEGF-dependent Down-regulation of Flk-1 in Endothelial Cells—To further investigate the VEGF-dependent down-regulation of Flk-1 shown in Fig. 1C, we monitored, by Western blotting on total cell lysates from BAECs, the effect of a VEGF treatment on total Flk-1 protein levels. First, when cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100-based buffer, VEGF (50 ng/ml) stimulation induced a significant decrease in Flk-1 protein levels (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained when cells were lysed directly in SDS sample buffer (2% SDS), indicating that changes in detergent solubility of Flk-1 following stimulation cannot account for the observed down-regulation (Fig. 2B). This reduction, under both lysing conditions, was clearly noticeable after 15 min of stimulation and maximal after 30–60 min (Fig. 2, A and B). Stimulation of BAEC for 30 min with increasing concentrations of VEGF (1–50 ng/ml) showed that this effect was dose-dependent and maximal at 25 ng/ml (Fig. 2C). In all cases, the cellular levels of Akt, used as a control for protein loading, were not affected by VEGF treatment (Fig. 2). These results indicate that VEGF stimulation induces specific degradation of Flk-1, which contributes to the reduced VEGF-dependent eNOS activation following a prior VEGF pretreatment of endothelial cells. VEGF Stimulates Ubiquitination of Flk-1—The ubiquitination of cellular proteins targets them for the degradative pathways. We investigated the ability of VEGF to induce the addition of ubiquitin moieties on the activated Flk-1 receptor. BAECs were stimulated with low concentration of VEGF (10 ng/ml), which is sufficient to activate Flk-1 but maintains its degradation to a minimum. Immunoblotting against ubiquitin on the Flk-1 immunoprecipitates showed that Flk-1 is ubiquitinated in response to VEGF treatment of BAECs (Fig. 3A). The anti-ubiquitin immunoblot reveals that the ubiquitination machinery adds multiple and variable numbers of ubiquitin moieties to Flk-1, because the polyubiquitinated form of Flk-1 is detected as a smear (Fig. 3A). Reprobing of the immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that Flk-1 is rapidly and transiently tyrosine phosphorylated in response to VEGF treatment and that ubiquitination kinetically follows the VEGF-induced autophosphorylation of Flk-1 (Fig. 3A). VEGF Stimulates Cbl Activation and Association to Flk-1— The ubiquitin ligase Cbl has been shown to mediate ligand-dependent down-regulation of several RTKs. We therefore investigated the ability of VEGF to activate Cbl and promote its association to Flk-1 upon activation. As seen in Fig. 3B, the activation of Flk-1 resulted in a rapid and transient phosphorylation (maximal at 5 min) of Flk-1 (Fig. 3B, top panels). Secondly, the BAEC lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against Cbl, and the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of Cbl and its association with Flk-1 were monitored. Immunoblotting analysis of the Cbl immunoprecipitates confirmed that VEGF stimulation of BAEC led to a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of Cbl on tyrosine residues (Fig. 3B,middle panels). Furthermore, blotting with anti-Flk-1 antibodies revealed that VEGF stimulation of BAEC increased the presence of Flk-1 in the Cbl immunoprecipitates (Fig. 3B, lower panel). To confirm the VEGF-dependent association of Cbl with Flk-1, we transiently cotransfected COS-7 cells with plasmids coding for Flk-1 and either β-Gal or Cbl (Fig. 3C). Overexpression of Cbl in COS-7 cells resulted in increased detection of Cbl associated with the transfected Flk-1 receptor (Fig. 3C, middle panel; compare lanes 1 and 2). Moreover, in Cbl-overexpressed COS-7 cells, VEGF stimulation resulted in enhanced association of Cbl with Flk-1 (Fig. 3C, middle panel; compare lanes 2 and 3). Cbl was strongly detected only when Flk-1 immunoprecipitates were performed on COS-7 cells overexpressing both Flk-1 and Cbl, indicating that the co-immunoprecipitation was specific for the presence of Flk-1 (Fig. 3C, middle panel; compare lanes 2 and 4). Overall, these results suggest that stimulation of Flk-1 activates Cbl and also promotes its recruitment to the activated Flk-1 receptor. Cbl Mediates Stimulus-dependent Ubiquitination of Flk-1— To demonstrate that Cbl has the capacity to mediate ubiquitination of Flk-1, we monitored the impact of Cbl overexpression on Flk-1-stimulated ubiquitination. We thus transfected COS-7 cells with Flk-1 and HA-tagged ubiquitin in the presence or absence of Cbl or the mutant form 70Z/3-Cbl. 70Z/3-Cbl has been shown to be an oncogenic form of Cbl that lacks part of the ubiquitin ligase RING domain (▵366–382) (21Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). The addition of HA-ubiquitin on Flk-1 was monitored in transfected COS-7 cell lysates immunoprecipitated for Flk-1. VEGF stimulation of Cbl-overexpressing COS-7 cells resulted in increased detection of HA-ubiquitin in the Flk-1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4A; top panel). The anti-HA-immunoblot is again detected as a smear rather than a distinct band as Flk-1 is polyubiquitinated in response to VEGF (Fig. 4A, anti-HA immunoblot). By contrast, overexpression of the mutant 70Z/3-Cbl did not enhance VEGF-induced ubiquitination of the transfected Flk-1 (Fig. 4B, top panel). Moreover, the addition of HA-ubiquitin in our assay was specific for Flk-1, because no HA was detected in Flk-1 immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with HA-ubiquitin and Cbl only (Fig. 4B, lane 7). These findings demonstrate that Cbl can mediate Flk-1 ubiquitination and that the RING finger motif of Cbl is necessary for this effect. Cbl Overexpression Abrogates Flk-1-dependent Nitric Oxide Production—To investigate the effect of Cbl on VEGF-mediated NO release, we thus transfected COS-7 cells with Flk-1 and eNOS expression vectors and monitored the effect of overexpression of Cbl and 70Z/3-Cbl on VEGF-dependent NO release (Fig. 5A). Nitric oxide accumulation in the tissue culture media, measured as nitrite by specific chemiluminescence, was monitored for 2h in presence of 50 ng/ml of VEGF. As expected, higher levels of NO in the media were detected from COS-7 cells expressing eNOS as compared with β-Gal-expressing cells (data not shown) (12Fulton D. Gratton J.P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar). Coexpression of Flk-1 with eNOS in the presence of VEGF increased NO production significantly when compared with eNOS coexpressed with β-Gal. This indicates that Flk-1 activation has the capacity to stimulate eNOS-dependent NO release in transfected COS-7 cells (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, coexpression of Cbl with Flk-1 and eNOS inhibited the Flk-1-dependent NO release from VEGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 5A, compare lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, Cbl did not exert any inhibiting effects on eNOS alone (compare lanes 1 and 3). This indicates that the effects of Cbl on NO release are specific to Flk-1-dependent stimulations and not on eNOS activity per se. Finally, 70Z/3-Cbl expression, in marked contrast to Cbl, did not affect Flk-1-stimulated NO release. Interestingly, 70Z/3-Cbl showed a tendency (which, however, did not reach significance) to increase NO release induced by stimulation of Flk-1 (compare lanes 2 and 5). These results show that Cbl negatively modulates Flk-1-dependent eNOS activation and that the RING finger motif is essential for the down-regulatory effects of Cbl on Flk-1-mediated NO production. Enhanced VEGF-dependent Degradation of Flk-1 in BAEC Overexpressing Cbl—To ascertain the regulatory role of Cbl in endothelial cell responses, we transiently transfected BAEC with expression vectors that code for either Cbl or GFP as a control. Transient transfections in BAEC are relatively inefficient (≈30%); however, our results showed that BAEC transfected with Cbl showed a significant overexpression of Cbl when compared with control cells transfected with GFP vector (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, VEGF stimulation of BAEC overexpressing Cbl resulted in a more rapid kinetic of Flk-1 degradation when compared with GFP-transfected cells. Although levels of Flk-1 in unstimulated GFP- or Cbl-transfected BAECs were equivalent, BAECs overexpressing Cbl showed, at 5 and 15 min of VEGF (25 ng/ml) stimulation, a marked decrease in the receptor band when compared with GFP-expressing cells that showed only a slight decrease in band intensity at 15 min of VEGF stimulation. These results confirm a role for Cbl in VEGF-dependent degradation of Flk-1 in endothelial cells. VEGF Stimulation of Endothelial Cells Induces Relocalization of Cbl to Vesicular Structures—Finally, we examined cellular localization of Flk-1 and Cbl by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy in fixed and permeabilized BAECs following VEGF stimulation. Fig. 6 shows that, in control-unstimulated conditions, Flk-1 staining is prominent in the cytoplasm as punctate membrane-associated structures as well as at the surface of cells. Cbl staining in control conditions showed a light and relatively uniform cytoplasmic staining. In VEGF-stimulated cells, Flk-1 plasma membrane staining disappeared, and the cytoplasmic stain became more uniform. VEGF stimulation of BAEC promoted a marked relocalization of Cbl into vesicular structures, which, in part, colocalized with Flk-1. No staining was observed when cells were incubated with a non-immune serum as well as a secondary antibody alone (data not shown). The results presented herein show the following. 1) Flk-1 is rapidly down-regulated following sustained VEGF stimulation of endothelial cells. 2) VEGF stimulation promotes Cbl activation and enhances its association to Flk-1. 3) Cbl is responsible for the VEGF-stimulated ubiquitination and consequently degradation of Flk-1. We thus provide evidence that Cbl-dependent negative regulation of the Flk-1 receptor is a novel mechanism for down-regulation of VEGF-stimulated NO production from endothelial cells. Nitric oxide release from endothelial cells is centrally involved in multiple aspects of VEGF physiological effects. Indeed, as demonstrated in eNOS null mice, NO release has been shown to be essential for VEGF-mediated increases in vascular permeability, angiogenesis, and endothelial cell migration (29Cross M.J. Claesson-Welsh L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 201-207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar, 30Fukumura D. Gohongi T. Kadambi A. Izumi Y. Ang J. Yun C.O. Buerk D.G.

Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus regulation of VEGF cellular signals, including NO production, is tightly controlled. Our study shows that VEGF pretreatment of BAEC prevents any further activation of the Akt/eNOS signaling pathway from a second VEGF stimulation. Our results demonstrated that VEGF-dependent degradation of Flk-1 is involved in this desensitization of cells to VEGF stimulation. The degradation of Flk-1 actively participates in the regulation of VEGF responses in endothelial cells through the rapid inhibition of VEGF-stimulated eNOS activation and NO release (Figs. 1 and 2). One can also assume that rapid degradation of Flk-1 may also participate in the regulation of other components of VEGF signaling. However, the consequences on long term effects of VEGF such as endothelial cell migration, proliferation, and survival have not yet been investigated. Ubiquitination of RTKs is known to target them to the lysosomal and proteasomal machineries (21Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 294-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Indeed, consistent with these findings we demonstrate that, following VEGF stimulation, Flk-1 is multi-ubiquitinated in both BAEC and Flk-1 transfected COS-7 cells (Figs. 3 and 4). Polyubiquitination of cellular proteins, including RTKs, has emerged as a posttranslational modification that controls the cellular levels of proteins that are regulated either constitutively or in response to the cellular environment (22Weissman A.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). We now show that polyubiquitination is involved in the regulation of membrane Flk-1 receptor levels. Our results also demonstrate that Cbl is tyrosine phosphorylated and recruited to Flk-1 following VEGF stimulation of BAEC (Fig. 3). Cbl has initially been identified as a multi-adaptor protein involved in the recruitment of signaling complexes. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl upon stimulation results in its association to the Src homology 2 domain containing proteins such as the p85 subunit of PI3-kinase, the nucleotide exchange factor VAV, and the Src-like kinases Fyn and Lyn (32Panchamoorthy G.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2019-2024Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Cbl contains a proline-rich domain that is involved in Src homology 3 domain interactions. The demonstration of an involvement of Cbl in the negative regulation of RTKs came from studies of Caenorhabditis elegans that showed that a loss of function of the Cbl homologue Sli-1 compensated for Let-23 (EGF-R) signaling (36Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 37Jongeward G.D. Clandinin T.R. Sternberg P.W. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1553-1566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies revealed that Cbl could function as an ubiquitin ligase that recruits ubiquitin-loaded E2 enzymes to a ligand-activated receptor (38Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our results show that the association of Cbl with Flk-1 is enhanced in response to VEGF stimulation of BAEC and in transfected COS-7 cells. This association of Cbl to activated RTKs is most likely mediated by the N-terminal phosphotyrosine-binding domain of Cbl. However, we cannot exclude that a tyrosine-phosphorylated accessory protein may act as an intermediate in the docking of Cbl to Flk-1. Nonetheless the two proteins need to be in proximity in order for the flanking RING finger motif of Cbl to transfer the ubiquitin group onto the target receptor. Indeed, we demonstrate that overexpression of Cbl strongly enhances ubiquitination and degradation of Flk-1 and that a Cbl mutant lacking the RING finger domain, 70Z/3-Cbl, cannot mediate ligand-dependent Flk-1 ubiquitination (38Yokouchi M. Kondo T. Houghton A. Bartkiewicz M. Horne W.C. Zhang H. Yoshimura A. Baron R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31707-31712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Our report also demonstrates that Cbl regulates VEGF-stimulated NO release from cells. The coexpression of Cbl with Flk-1 and eNOS inhibits VEGF-stimulated NO release specifically. Furthermore, the mutant form of Cbl, 70Z/3-Cbl, failed to inhibit NO release and, interestingly, seemed to have a dominant negative effect on endogenous Cbl function by significantly enhancing NO release as well as inhibiting VEGF-stimulated Flk-1 ubiquitination (Figs. 4 and 5). These results are in line with those showing that oncogenic forms of Cbl, such as v-Cbl and 70Z/3-Cbl, led to enhanced signaling from RTKs and, in some cases, to hyperproliferation and tumorigenesis (39Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2909-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 40Andoniou C.E. Thien C.B. Langdon W.Y. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4515-4523Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 41Bonita D.P. Miyake S. Lupher Jr., M.L. Langdon W.Y. Band H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4597-4610Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The VEGF-stimulated association of Cbl with Flk-1 is rapid, sustained, and consistent within the time frame of Flk-1 degradation. Interestingly, we demonstrate that overexpression of Cbl in BAEC accelerates VEGF-stimulated degradation of Flk-1. This confirms that, in endothelial cells, Cbl mediates Flk-1 degradation and that the levels of expression of Cbl can affect Flk-1 responses by regulating receptor levels following stimulation of cells. In unstimulated conditions, our results indicate that Cbl expression does not, however, alter basal levels of the Flk-1 protein upon stimulation of cells; Cbl influences the rate of its degradation. The precise subcellular localization where Cbl acts on RTKs is still unclear, as some studies show that receptor ubiquitination might occur in endosomal compartments, and other studies indicate that this occurs at the plasma membrane before the internalization route (23Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 42de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, our immunofluorescence data show that, following a 30-min VEGF stimulation of endothelial cells, Cbl is located in vesicular-like structures (Fig. 6). This seems to be in agreement with previous studies reporting that Cbl associates with the EGF receptor and remains receptor-associated throughout endocytosis (42de Melker A.A. van der Horst G. Calafat J. Jansen H. Borst J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2167-2178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results show that negative regulation of Flk-1 by Cbl results in impaired NO release and that ubiquitination of Flk-1 through Cbl is involved in the desensitization of the cellular response to rapid VEGF signaling. Cbl has been shown to be activated in response to endothelial cells submitted to fluid shear stress and also participate in the activation of PI3-kinase following shear (43Wang Y. Miao H. Li S. Chen K.D. Li Y.S. Yuan S. Shyy J.Y. Chien S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: C1540-C1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 44Miao H. Yuan S. Wang Y. Tsygankov A. Chien S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 292: 892-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Knowing that Cbl functions as an adaptor-signaling molecule as well as an E3 ligase, it is tempting to speculate that prolonged shear stress on endothelial cells results in decreased Flk-1 protein expression. In summary, our report demonstrates that polyubiquitination of the VEGF receptor, Flk-1, by the ubiquitin ligase adaptor protein, Cbl, mediates VEGF-dependent degradation of Flk-1. Importantly, our study provides evidences that Cbl-mediated effects lead to important biological consequences in endothelial cells such as the inhibition of VEGF-mediated NO release and enhanced Flk-1 degradation. Further studies will likely demonstrate the involvement of this novel mode of biological control of Flk-1 signaling in other physiological effects of VEGF.

Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6275) Google Scholar). Apoptosis is generally regulated by the fine balance and interplay among members of the BCL-2 family of proteins in a cell and tissue specific manner (5Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar, 6Rutledge S.E. Chin J.W. Schepartz A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). This family comprises nearly 20 proteins, which share one or more short regions of sequence homology, the BCL-2 homology regions (BH1, BH2, BH3 and BH4) that are essential for their function (5Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 647-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (3338) Google Scholar). The family is further divided into three subfamilies: anti-apoptotic members including BCL-2, BCL-xL, BCL-w, MCL-1, and A1, which contain all four BH regions; pro-apoptotic members that contain BH1, BH2 and BH3 regions and function as death effectors (BAX and BAK); and pro-apoptotic BH3-only members (e.g. BAD, BID, BIM, BIK), which couple upstream death stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor family receptor stimultation or p53-mediated stress signals, to regulation of the multi-BH region members (7Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cell. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The ratio of anti-apoptotic versus pro-apoptotic members often determines cell death or survival in response to these signals, and alterations in these ratios can result in disease susceptibility. Enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic members occurs in many cancers. For example, up-regulation of BCL-2 in follicular lymphoma, leukemia, breast, and lung cancers (8Voutsadakis I.A.

Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) have been determined and surprisingly they all possess very similar three-dimensional structures despite of their opposing roles in the regulation of apoptosis. In both BCL-2 and BCL-xL, two central hydrophobic helices α5 and α6 are surrounded by five amphipathic α-helices. Both proteins contain a surface-exposed hydrophobic cleft, formed by BH (1Green D.R.

Heterodimerization between anti- and pro-apoptotic members is critical for regulating the multiple death pathways influenced by this family of proteins (1Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 5Cory S. Adams J.M. Nat. Rev.

In heterodimers, the hydrophobic binding cleft of the anti-apoptotic partner is occupied by the BH3 region of a pro-apoptotic member and, in cells, this interaction is typically triggered by upstream signaling.

(root mean square deviation) values for backbone atoms of BCL-2 and BCL-xL is less than 2 Å, making them close homologues (17Petros A.M. Medek A. Nettesheim D.G. Kim D.H. Yoon H.S. Swift K. Matayoshi E.D. Oltersdorf T. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3012-3017Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Similarly, 2–3 Å r.m.s.d. was observed between BCL-2 (or BCL-xL) and BAX (17Petros A.M. Medek A. Nettesheim D.G. Kim D.H. Yoon H.S. Swift K. Matayoshi E.D. Oltersdorf T. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the loop structure connecting helices α1 and α2 in these proteins is largely disordered (15Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar, 17Petros A.M. Medek A. Nettesheim D.G. Kim D.H. Yoon H.S. Swift K.

Solution structure analysis also revealed that there is more negative potential at the bottom of the binding site in BCL-xL than in BCL-2, which probably accounts for the higher affinity of BCL-xL for the BH3-peptides of BAD and BAK (17Petros A.M. Medek A. Nettesheim D.G. Kim D.H. Yoon H.S. Swift K. Matayoshi E.D. Oltersdorf T. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2528-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). The helix α2 contains the BH3-region and appears to be packed closer to the hydrophobic pocket in BCL-2 and BCL-xL than in BAX (17Petros A.M. Medek A. Nettesheim D.G. Kim D.H. Yoon H.S. Swift K.

Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The overall α-helical fold of BH3-only BID is similar to that of other BCL-2 family proteins but the r.m.s.d. values for backbone atoms are relatively larger (4–5 Å) (19Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S.

Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). Finally, the three-dimensional structures of the BCL-2 family proteins show significant resemblance to bacterial pore-forming proteins such as diphtheria toxin and colicins (22Liang H. Fesik S.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 291-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 24Losonczi J.A. Olejniczak E.T. Betz S.F. Harlan J.E. Mack J. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11024-11033Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro studies demonstrated that BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BAX could form ion-conducting channels in artificial membranes, an activity that might contribute to their function in vivo (25Minn A.J.

There has been little reported on the structure-function relationship of BCL-w, despite the fact that BCL-w provides pleiotropic resistance against multiple death stimuli (28Gibson L. Holmgreen S.P. Huang D.C. Bernard O. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Sutherland G.R. Baker E. Adams J.M. Cory S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 665-675PubMed Google Scholar), is up-regulated in colorectal cancer (14Wilson J.W.

Here, we report the NMR structure of this protein, which in addition to confirming that BCL-w is closely related to other family members, has uncovered a novel conformation adopted by helix α8 compared with the corresponding region in BCL-2 and BCL-xL. Helix α8 in the native BCL-w is juxtaposed to the transmembrane segment and, intriguingly, in the structure of the cytosolic region reported here, folds into the BH3-binding pocket of the protein where it influences interactions of BCL-w with BH3 ligands. Sample Preparation—The cDNAs of wild-type human BCL-w and a P117V mutant, both lacking the C-terminal transmembrane (Δ172–193) region, were subcloned in pET-29b+ plasmid which provides a C-terminal His tag LEHHHHHH (Novagen). The amino acid sequence of BCL-w is shown in Fig. 1. Parallel construct deleted for helix α8 and the transmembrane region (Δ154–193) was also constructed and expressed. C-terminal (Δ196–233) and loop (Δ45–84) truncated BCL-xL was prepared similarly. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). For NMR, cultures were grown in M9 media supplemented with 15N ammonium chloride and/or 13C-enriched glucose to produce uniformly 15N- or 15N-, 13C-labeled proteins. Cells were grown at 37 °C and BCL-w synthesis induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h. Soluble BCL-w protein was purified by one step by Ni2+-affinity chromatography. Typically 7–9 mg of BCL-w were obtained from 1 liter of cell culture. Mass spectral analysis (Sciex API MS system, Thornhill) showed that the N-terminal methionine residues were absent. NMR samples contained 0.7–1.4 mm BCL-w protein in 90% H2O/10% D2O, 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.3), 0.5 mm EDTA, and 3 mm dithiothreitol. Unlabeled BH3-peptides of human BID (IIKNIARHLAQVG-DSMDRSI-CONH2) and of human BAK (TKGQVGRQLAIIG-DDINRRY-CONH2) were synthesized (BRI-NRC, Montreal) and used for NMR studies of the BCL-w/BID-BH3-peptide complex and for determining the binding constants to BCL-w and BCL-xL. NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were acquired at 25–30 °C on Bruker DRX-500 and Varian INOVA-800 spectrometers. The following experiments were used for backbone and side chain 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments: HNCACB, CBCA(CO)HN, HNCA, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, 1H TOCSY-(CO)HN, 13C TOCSY-(CO)HN, and HCCH-TOCSY (32Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar). Values of 3J(HNHα) were estimated from HNHA experiments (33Kuboniwa H. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 871-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Proton homonuclear NOEs were obtained from 15N-edited NOESY and 13C, 15N-edited-NOESY spectra recorded at 800 MHz with a mixing time of 90 ms. Amide heteronuclear 15N{1H} NOEs were measured and used for determination of high mobility regions of protein (34Peng J.W. Wagner G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 563-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). 1H-15N residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) with a precision of ±1Hz were extracted from IPAP-HSQC experiments (35Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) on an isotropic sample and on a sample containing 6 mg/ml Pf1 phage. NMR spectra were processed using NMRPIPE (36Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol.

Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar), values of 3J(HNHα) coupling constants, and sequential and medium-range NOE patterns. The protein structure was refined using standard protocol in CNS Version 1.1 (39Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kuntsleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

The numbers of different types of contraints are present in Table I, and NH RDCs for terminal residues (1–8 and 170–179) and the flexible loop region (residues 27–40) were not included in structure calculations. Manually assigned NOE distance constraints were classified according to the peak intensities as strong (1.8–3.0 Å), medium (2.0–4.0 Å), or weak (2.5–5.0 Å).

Color figures were generated with MOLSCRIPT (41Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), RASTER-3D (42Merritt E.A. Bacon D.J.

Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar). The BCL-w atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank under accession code 1MK3. Structural data for related proteins were taken from Protein Data Bank entries of 1BXL for BCL-xL and 1F16 for BAX. The pairwise coordinate r.m.s.d. comparisons between these proteins was obtained by the DALI program (44Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3565) Google Scholar). Measurement of Binding Constants—Binding of BH3-peptides from BAK and BID to BCL-w and BCL-xL was determined by SELDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization-time of flight). Briefly, 1 μg of BCL-w or BCL-xL and varying concentrations of peptide were incubated in 25 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at room temperature for 1 h. The incubation mix was then adjusted to 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), and applied to the binding spots on a nickel-activated immobilized metal affinity chip-protein chip using a bio-processor (Ciphergen). After 1-h binding, the chip was washed three times with 0.5 m NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), and the chip read in the PBS-II (Ciphergen) mass spectrometer. Peak intensities from the peptide signal in three separate experiments were used for the calculation of binding affinities (Kd). Peak intensities were normalized for the total ion current by the Protein Chip software (Version 3.0, Ciphergen). Resonance Assignments—The 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-enriched BCL-w showed good signal dispersion, which is typical for α-helical proteins of BCL-2 family (Fig. 2a). Five tryptophan sidechain Hϵ1 signals were distinctly visible; the most downfield signal (δH = 10.84 ppm) was broadened at room temperature. Unfortunately, the HSQC spectrum of wild-type BCL-w also contained signals from a second minor conformer (∼20%). This second BCL-w form could not be removed by purification, varying buffer conditions, or denaturation/renaturation procedures. In addition, many signals of wild-type BCL-w residues were weak or broad, and these residues belonged mostly to the region between helices α5 and α6. Since such effects could be related to cis-trans isomerization of proline residues, we decided to replace proline 117 in BCL-w with a valine residue, which is present at the homologous position in the BCL-xL sequence (Fig. 1). The improved HSQC spectrum of the P117V mutant of BCL-w is shown in Fig. 2b. The spectrum did not contain the signals of the minor form, and more than 95% of backbone amide resonances could be identified and assigned by triple-resonance NMR techniques. The P117V subsitution is unlikely to affect the function of BCL-w because of its location in a turn, outside of the conserved BH-(1Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 2Troy C.M. Salvesen G.S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 3Walker L.S. Abbas A.K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar) regions. This subsitution resulted in small 1H,15N chemical shift changes only for residues 111–125 (maximum ΔδH of 0.13 ppm for Gly-120), which are close to the P117V subsitution. The positions of other amide signals coincided with signals of the main isomeric form of wild-type BCL-w, which suggests that this main conformer contains a trans conformation for proline 117. Despite the significant improvement of in the NMR spectrum of BCL-w (P117V), the most downfield tryptophan indole Hϵ1 resonance (assigned to residue Trp-167) was still broad in comparison with other Hϵ1 signals. This broadening does not appear to be due to proline 117 isomerization. Protein Structure and Region Mobility—The structure of BCL-w (P117V) was calculated based on a total of 1631 NMR-derived restraints including 1H-15N RDC (Fig. 3). The set of best structures with lowest energy is presented in Fig. 4; structural statistics is shown in Table I. Except for terminal residues and the flexible loop region (residues 25–41), the mean r.m.s.d. from the average structure was 0.60 Å for backbone atoms. All φ and Ψ angles fell within the most favored and allowed regions of Ramachandran space. A ribbon representation of the BCL-w structure closest to the ensemble average is presented in Fig. 5a. It contains 8 principal α-helices arranged in a fold similar to that of other BCL-2 family proteins. The pairwise Ca-atomic coordinate r.m.s.d. between entire BCL-w and BCL-xL structures is 2.8 Å (DALI Z factor = 7.8), and the same r.m.s.d. between BCL-w and BAX proteins is 3.5 Å (Z = 11.3). Exclusion of the flexible loop, and the C and N termini of BCL-w (i.e. comparison for BCL-w residues 10–24 and 42–168), gave a r.m.s.d. of 2.8 Å for BCL-w/BCL-xL (for 117 structurally equivalent amino acids in regions of helices α1 and α2–α7). The same comparison for BCL-w/BAX gave an r.m.s.d. of 2.7 Å (for 140 structurally equivalent amino acids in regions of helices α1 and α2–α8). The signs of RDCs for BCL-w in Pf1-phage solution demonstrate that the major axis of the alignment tensor is aligned parallel to helices α4–α6 and perpendicular to helix α2 (Fig. 3). The variations in sign of RDCs in the terminal helices α1 and α8 are consistent with intermediate orientations (45Mesleh M.F. Veglia G. DeSilva T.M. Marassi F.M. Opella S.J. J. Am. Chem.

This is different from the structures of the antiapoptotic BCL-xL protein (Fig. 5c) where helix α8 was either absent or oriented into solution (15Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P.

Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). It is similar to the conformation of the C-terminal transmembrane helix in the pro-apoptotic BAX protein (Fig. 5b) (21Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). The aromatic side chain of Trp-167 is directed into a very restricted space between helices α4 and α5 of BCL-w (Fig. 5d), which may partially explain the downfield chemical shift of the Hϵ1(Trp-167) resonance. Further differences between these proteins are evident in the analysis of 15N{1H} heteronuclear NOE measurements of backbone amide mobility (Fig. 3). This analysis shows that the α-helices in BCL-w are less mobile (with NOEs more than 0.6) than the loop regions (NOEs between 0.4 and 0.6) and terminal tails (NOEs less than 0.4). More notably, helix α8 is distinctly more mobile (NOEs ∼0.6–0.7) than the other α-helices. The BCL-w helix α8 also appears to be more mobile than the corresponding C-terminal transmembrane helix in BAX (21Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). This suggests that the affinity of this intra-molecular binding is weaker in BCL-w than in BAX. The relatively poor affinity of helix α8 for the BCL-w cleft may be due to the small number of hydrophobic residues in this helix as compared with the C-terminal helix of BAX (Figs. 1 and Fig. 5d). There are also three negatively charged Glu and three positively charged Arg residues in the helix α8 of BCL-w. For BAX, it was proposed that the C-terminal α-helix can prevent dimerization between partners in solution due to its very tight binding in the hydrophobic cleft (21Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Tjandra N. Cell. 2000; 103: 645-654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar). This does not appear to be the case for BCL-w as the helix α8 displays significant mobility in the backbone amides. BCL-w/BH3-Peptide Complexes—To study the interaction of BH3 region peptides from pro-apoptotic proteins with BCL-w, we made 1:1 complexes of wild-type BCL-w with 20-mer BH3-peptides derived from human BID, BAK, BAX, BAD, BIK, or BOK proteins. The analysis of 1H-15N HSQC spectra showed that all these peptides, except BOK, interact tightly with BCL-w. The best quality NMR spectra were obtained for the BCL-w/BID-BH3-peptide complex, which was the most soluble and where amount of the BCL-w minor cis-proline 117 conformer was less than 5%. The amide signals in the complex (excluding helix α3 and the region between α5 and α6) were assigned by triple-resonance NMR spectroscopy. General analysis showed that the positions of BCL-w α-helices in the complex with the BID peptide were the same as in wild-type BCL-w, but that the C-terminal helix was unfolded into solution. As evidence of this, measured values of 3J(HNHα) couplings for practically all the C-terminal residues 157–168 were larger than 5 Hz. Also, in the complex, the Hϵ1 signal of Trp-167 was not broadened and was strongly shifted upfield (ΔδH = 0.7 ppm). More detailed analysis of BID peptide binding to BCL-w was carried out by comparison of chemical shifts for backbone amide signals in HSQC spectra. The BCL-w residues showing the largest chemical shift changes, {(Δ1H shift)2 + (Δ15N shift × 0.2)2}1/2 in ppm, upon binding of BID peptide, were Phe-53 (0.34), Glu-54 (0.74), Thr-55 (0.84) in helix α2, Ser-83 (0.36), Leu-86 (0.43) in helix α4, Trp-93 (0.35), Arg-95 (0.45) in helix α5, and Ala-155 (0.66), Leu-156 (0.55), Glu-157 (0.88), Glu-158 (0.73), Ala-159 (0.54), Leu-162 (0.35), Ala-168 (0.75), Ser-169 (0.51), Val-170 (0.68) in the C-terminal region (including helix α8). These data led us to conclude that the binding site of BID peptide in BCL-w is similar to that of BCL-xL (Fig. 5c) and that the BID peptide binds via the hydrophobic cleft of BCL-w. The data also suggest that the C-terminal helix α8 of BCL-w is displaced from the cleft upon ligand binding. We expect that the BCL-w/BID peptide structure is similar to that of the BCL-xL/BAK-peptide complex (16Sattler M. Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar) shown in Fig. 5c. Upon addition of ligand, the peptide binds tightly in the hydrophobic cleft of BCL-w protein and displaces the C-terminal helix α8. Nevertheless, helix α8 may modulate or prevent the binding of lower affinity peptides and proteins as observed for the BOK BH3-peptide. The BH3-peptide interaction analysis by SELDI-TOF mass spectroscopy supports this view (Table II). The apparent affinities of BCL-xL and wild-type BCL-w were similar for both BID and BAK-peptides reflecting the similarity of the hydrophobic binding pockets of these two proteins. Deletion of helix α8 from BCL-w resulted in a significant increase in the binding affinities for BAK and BID BH3-peptides. This likely reflects increased accessibility of the binding cleft for interaction with the BH3-peptides. Surprisingly, the P117V substitution in BCL-w led to a 3–4-fold reduction in affinity for the BH3-peptides despite only minor effects in the NMR spectrum. We also investigated by NMR the consequences of deletion of residues 154–171 (including helix α8) from BCL-w and noted that this led to strong line broadening in 1H-15N HSQC spectra of BCL-w at 1 mm or higher protein concentrations. Thus the deletion of helix α8 appears to lead to weak homodimerization/oligomerization of BCL-w in solution.Table IIBinding affinities of BAK and BID BH3-peptides to BCL-w and BCL-xlProteinKdaDissociation constants obtained using SELDI-TOF mass spectroscopy as the mean of three observations ± S.D.BAK-BH3BID-BH3nmBCL-w (wild-type)280 ± 86302 ± 49BCL-w (P117V)992 ± 971270 ± 31BCL-w (P117V) (δα8)bDeleted for amino acids 154-17184 ± 13463 ± 84BCL-xl83 ± 13448 ± 95a Dissociation constants obtained using SELDI-TOF mass spectroscopy as the mean of three observations ± S.D.b Deleted for amino acids 154-171 Open table in a new tab In conclusion, our results suggest that BCL-w has a structure very similar to that of BCL-2 and BCL-xL, consistent with the ability of BCL-w to regulate apoptosis in response to diverse death signals. The ability of helix α8 to fold into the BH3-binding cleft of BCL-w suggests, however, an additional level of regulation that was not observed before in BCL-2 and BCL-xL. In this regard, BCL-w exhibits similarities to the soluble form of BAX in which the C-terminal transmembrane helix is sequestered within the peptide binding cleft on the protein surface and prevents heterodimerization with cytosolic proteins. Helix α8 of BCL-w might play a similar regulatory role, restricting interactions of BCL-w to only those partners that are capable of displacing helix α8 from the BH3-binding cleft.

On the other hand, splicing mutations, including all intronic mutations and several exonic mutations, are associated with changes in Tau4R/3R ratio. These observations suggest that a proper ratio of Tau4R/3R is essential for normal function of Tau in the human brain. It remains unclear how alterations in Tau4R/3R ratio lead to neuronal degeneration and, in some cases, also glial dysfunction and death. However, the discovery of these splicing mutations in the tau gene indicates the critical importance of controlling the balance of different Tau isoforms by alternative splicing for normal brain function. We are interested in understanding molecular mechanisms underlying tau alternative splicing regulation. Our previous work established a tau minigene system (17Jiang Z. Cote J. Kwon J.M. Goate A.M. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4036-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Many of the tau intronic mutations described so far are near the splice donor site (5′ splice site) of the intron following exon 10. Our biochemical studies support the model that some intronic mutations near the 5′ splice site following exon 10 destabilize a stem-loop structure and lead to enhanced U1 snRNP 1The abbreviations used are: snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; Ad, adenovirus; RT, reverse transcriptase; WT, wild type; RNAi, RNA interference; ESE, exonic splicing enhancer. interaction with the 5′ splice site of exon 10 and thus an increase in splicing between exon 10 and exon 11 and an increase in the ratio of Tau4R to Tau3R (15Hutton M.

In addition to intronic mutations, several exonic mutations (shown in Fig. 1), including N279K, Del280K, L284L, N296N, N296H, and S305N, have also been found to alter exon 10 splicing (20Clark L.N.

Although it was proposed based on sequence analyses and RT-PCR studies that these mutations may change the activity of certain exonic regulatory elements in exon 10, the mechanism by which these mutations affect exon 10 splicing was not clear. In this study, we used in vitro biochemical assays to dissect the cis-elements and trans-splicing factors involved in the regulation of tau Exon 10 inclusion. Our results have revealed an exonic splicing enhancer element located in exon 10. The activity of this AG-rich splicing enhancer is affected by N279K and Del280K mutations. Proteins interacting with this AG-rich sequence were analyzed using UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation assays. A 40-kDa protein containing a RNA-binding domain and a domain rich in serine and arginine (the SR domain), Tra2β, has been identified among the proteins interacting with this exonic enhancer element. The interaction of Tra2β with the exonic splicing enhancer correlates with the activity of this enhancer element in stimulating tau exon 10 splicing. Finally, down-regulation of Tra2β expression by RNA interference in transfected cells led to a reduction in tau exon 10 inclusion. These observations suggest that human Tra2β may act as an important regulator for facilitating exon 10 inclusion in tau splicing. Plasmid, Oligonucleotides, and Antibodies—The tau genomic DNA fragments containing exons 9–11 as well as intronic sequences flanking exon 10 were amplified by PCR from the normal adult human or FTDP-17 patient brain genomic DNA to make wild-type or mutant tau constructs. Tau minigene constructs were made by inserting the genomic fragments into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) between HindIII and XhoI sites under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (17Jiang Z. Cote J. Kwon J.M. Goate A.M. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4036-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Tau minigene plasmids with N279K and Del280K mutation were made by site-directed mutagenesis with specific oligonucleotides. TauEx10–11d5(dEn) was made by deletion of sequence GTG CAG ATA ATT AAT AAG AAG C as indicated by the thick line in Fig. 1A from TauEx10–11d5, and TauEn-IchEx9–10(WT, N279K, Del280K) were made by inserting this sequence upstream of the caspase-2 exon 9–10 splicing unit (44Cote J. Dupuis S. Jiang Z. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 938-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ad-TauEx10d5(WT, N279K) were made by replacing the upstream exon 9 and associated intronic sequences with the first exon region (L1) of the adenovirus (Ad) major late transcription unit. DNA sequence analysis of tau genomic fragments and different expression plasmids was carried out on an ABI 373A automatic sequencer using a PRISM Ready reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Dharmacon and IDT Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Anti-SR monoclonal antibody 1H4 was purchased from ATCC. A polyclonal antibody specific for human Tra2β was as described (67Beil B. Screaton G. Stamm S. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Transfections and RT-PCR—HeLaRB, HEK293, and N2a cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and were seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well in a six-well dish 24 h prior to transfection. Transfection was done using a standard calcium phosphate precipitation procedure with 1–3 μg of DNA as described (70Jiang Z.H. Zhang W.J. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency was routinely around 60%, as evaluated by cotransfection of a green fluorescent protein-expressing plasmid. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Splicing products derived from the expressed minigenes were detected using RT-PCR as previously described (70Jiang Z.H. Zhang W.J. Rao Y. Wu J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9155-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). cDNAs were also prepared from the frontal cortex region in human brain tissues obtained at autopsy. RT-PCR was also performed using primers specific for human Tra2β to detect the expression of this gene. In Vitro Splicing Assays—Splicing substrates were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase (Promega). Final concentrations of different reagents were as follows in a 10-μl reaction: 500 ng of linearized DNA template, 0.4 mm ATP and CTP, 0.1 mm GTP and UTP, 0.84 mm GpppG cap analogue (Amersham Biosciences), 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 units/μl RNasin (Promega), 1× transcription buffer (Promega), 20 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and 1 unit/μl RNA polymerase. Samples were then treated with 0.1 unit/μl DNase I (Promega) for 15 min and ethanol-precipitated. The full-length transcripts were gel-purified. Synthesis of cold competitor RNAs was in a scaled-up 100-μl reaction with the following modifications: 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 0.5 mm UTP, 0.42 mm cap analogue, and a trace amount of [α-32P]UTP for quantification. HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared according to previously established protocols and contained 20 mg/ml total proteins (71Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). Splicing reactions were set up and processed as previously (72Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1985; 42: 725-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) except that some batches of nuclear extracts were supplemented with 1 unit of creatine kinase (Sigma). 2–3 fmol of RNA substrates were added, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 2 h unless otherwise mentioned. Splicing products were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels. The identity of lariat molecules was determined by performing a debranching reaction in a S100 extract (73Ruskin B. Krainer A.R. Maniatis T. Green M.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 317-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), followed by gel migration alongside molecular weight markers. The intensity of the products was quantified by the PhosphorImager. In some splicing assays, purified SR protein or U2AF65 or cell lysates containing overexpressed Tra2β or SRp40 was added. UV Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation Assays—Splicing reactions were set up as described above except using 20 fmol of RNA substrates. 10-μl aliquots were transferred onto a 96-well microtiter plate and irradiated with 1 J in UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene). For site-specific cross-linking, a specific label was put inside the second AAG sequence following a protocol previously described (74Lapham J. Yu Y.T. Shu M.D. Steitz J.A. Crothers D.M. RNA. 1997; 3: 950-951PubMed Google Scholar, 75Yu Y.T. Methods. 1999; 18: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Various amounts of competitive transcripts were added to demonstrate the specifically bound proteins. Samples were then treated for 30 min at 37 °C with equal volume of RNase A (5 mg/ml). Radiolabeled cross-linked proteins were boiled for 5 min in 1× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE. For immunoprecipitation, following the RNase treatment, samples were incubated with 1H4 anti-SR monoclonal antibody (ATCC). Protein A/G-agarose beads were then added with further incubation and gentle rocking. The RNA-labeled proteins retained on the beads after several washings were eluted and resolved on SDS-PAGE. Site-specific Label Incorporation and Cross-linking—Human tau exon 10 DNA with N279K mutation was in vitro transcribed into RNA with trace-labeled [α-32P]UTP. 40 pmol of synthesized RNA was annealed with 60 pmol of chimeric oligonucleotide (3′-(UAUUAAU)2′-O-methyl-TCTT(CUUC)2′-O-methyl-5′) and cleaved with RNase H. The 3′-half RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase and labeled with [γ-32P]ATP. The 5′-half RNA was ligated with 3′-half RNA using a DNA ligation kit (Roche Applied Science) by bridge oligonucleotide (5′-CTGGACGTTGCTAAGATCCAGCTTCTTCTTAATTATCTGCACCTTTGG-3′). 30,000 cpm of RNA was incubated with 20–40 μg of HeLa cell nuclear extracts for cross-linking. Various amounts (0, 4, and 40 pmol) of competitor oligonucleotide (5′-GTGCAGATAATTAAGAAGAAGCTGGATC-3′) corresponding to the enhancer element were added. RNA-Protein Interaction Assays—40 fmol of biotin-conjugated RNAs corresponding to TauEx10–11dEn, TauEx10–11Del280K, TauEx10–11wt, and TauEx10–11N279K were incubated for 30 min on ice with various amounts of cell lysates prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a Tra2β-Myc expression construct. After affinity selection with streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma), the beads were washed four times in cold phosphate-buffered saline with 75 mm NaCl and 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Proteins associated with the biotinylated RNAs were dissolved in sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting using 9E10 anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Babco). U snRNP Blocking Assays—Partial inhibition of U snRNAs was achieved by incubation with 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleotides as described (17Jiang Z. Cote J. Kwon J.M. Goate A.M. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4036-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 2′-O-methyl oligonucleotides (U1, 8 μm; U2, 0.3 μm; U5, 12 μm; U6, 13 μm) were added to splicing reactions and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min prior to the addition of RNA substrates. Incubations were then carried on for 1.5 h. Splicing products were resolved on 8% denaturing gels. U1 snRNP RNase H Protection Assay—The TauEx10–11 RNA substrate (3 fmol) was added to a 12.5 μl of splicing reaction containing mock- or U1 snRNP-partially depleted HeLa cell cytoplasmic extracts S100 (53Black D.L. RNA. 1995; 1: 763-771PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. Oligonucleotides (20 pmol) directed against exon 10 5′ splice sites (17Jiang Z. Cote J. Kwon J.M. Goate A.M. Wu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4036-4048Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were then added along with 0.2 units of RNase H (Invitrogen), and the incubation continued for 10 min at 37 °C. Resulting RNA fragments were resolved on 6% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels (76Eperon I.C. Ireland D.C. Smith R.A. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3607-3617Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 77Chabot B. Blanchette M. Lapierre I. La Branche H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1776-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). SR proteins were prepared as described (78Zahler A.M. Lane W.S. Stolk J.A. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 837-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Tra2β protein-containing cell lysates were prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with Tra2β-Myc expression plasmid. RNA Interference Experiments—An RNA interference assay was carried out in HEK293 cells as described (79Elbashir S.M. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by Dharmacon (Boulder, CO). An Exonic Splicing Enhancer Located in Exon 10 of the Human Tau Pre-mRNA—The N279K mutation in exon 10 of the tau gene was reported to affect exon 10 splicing (Fig. 1A) (20Clark L.N. Poorkaj P. Wszolek Z. Geschwind D.H. Nasreddine Z.S. Miller B. Li D. Payami H. Awert F. Markopoulou K. Andreadis A. D'Souza I. Lee V.M. Reed L. Trojanowski J.Q. Zhukareva V. Bird T. Schellenberg G.

It was proposed that a T to G change in the N279K mutation might improve an exonic splicing enhancer because of the sequence change from AATAAGAAG to AAGAAGAAG. Consistent with the hypothesis that this AG-rich region acts as a splicing enhancer, is the discovery of the Del280K mutation that changes the sequence from AATAAGAAG to AATAAG in FTDP-17 patients.

https://openalex.org/W2087821761,"V-type or H+-ATPases are a family of ATP-dependent proton pumps that move protons across the plasma membrane at specialized sites such as kidney epithelial cells and osteoclasts as well as acidifying intracellular compartments. The 100-kDa polytopic a-subunit of this group of ATPases is suggested to play an important role in coupling the two functions of the pump, ATP hydrolysis and proton transport. In man, different a-subunit isoforms are encoded by four genes. ATP6V0A4 encodes a4, which is expressed apically in α-intercalated cells in both human and mouse kidney. We sought binding partners for the C terminus of a4 in order to address its potential role in the H+-ATPase complex. Random peptide phage display analysis revealed a consensus motif (WLELRP) with almost complete homology to part of the enzyme phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1). Activity of this enzyme is the rate-limiting step in glycolysis. Specificity of a4 binding to this peptide was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Protein-protein interaction was further demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation of a4 with PFK-1 from solubilized human kidney membrane proteins. An in vitro bead-bound PFK-1 pull-down assay showed that this interaction was also true for the ubiquitously expressed a1 subunit. Finally, PFK-1 co-immunolocalized with a4 in α-intercalated cells in the collecting ducts of human kidney. These findings indicate a direct link between V-type H+-ATPases and glycolysis via the C-terminal region of the a-subunit of the pump and suggest a novel regulatory mechanism between H+-ATPase function and energy supply. This interaction between the a-subunit and PFK-1 also provides new evidence that the C terminus of this subunit lies cytoplasmically in vivo.

The H+-, vacuolar-type or V-ATPases (hereafter abbreviated H+-ATPases) are a family of ATP-dependent proton pumps that acidify intracellular compartments in all cells. They also pump protons across the plasma membranes of osteoclasts and of certain epithelial cells in the kidney and male genital tract. H+-ATPases from fungi, plants, and animals are structurally very similar to each other (1Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar), consisting of two major functional domains known as V1 and V0. The V1 domain is composed of at least eight different subunits (A-H) and contains ATP binding sites involving the A and B subunits. This domain is mainly responsible for ATP hydrolysis. The V0 domain contains up to five additional subunits (a, c, c′, c″, and d) and is mainly responsible for proton translocation across the membrane in which it is anchored (2Zhang J. Feng Y. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23518-23523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The yeast V-ATPase is the best-characterized proton pump in eukaryotes. A more detailed structural model, mainly derived from studies of both yeast and bovine orthologs, is that H+-ATPases can better be defined by several regions. They are, as before, a catalytic core composed of A and B subunits; a central rotor or stalk, suggested to be composed of D and F subunits; a peripheral “stator” likely to be composed of the N terminus of the a-subunit together with C, E, G, and H, and a proton-translocating domain composed of the C terminus of a, with c, c′, and c″ subunits (3Landolt-Marticorena C.

H+-ATPases are structurally and evolutionarily related to the F1F0-ATP synthase, responsible for ATP synthesis in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and bacteria (6Weber J. Senior A.E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 7Fillingame R.H. J. Exp. Biol. 1997; 200: 217-224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg.

Interestingly, although the F1F0-ATP synthase retains the capacity either to synthesize ATP (using the energy provided by passive H+ movement) or to hydrolyze it, providing energy for proton pumping in the opposite direction, H+-ATPases can only perform the latter function. Whether the energy source for H+-ATPase function is derived from mitochondrial or glycolytic ATP is unclear, and the regulatory mechanisms involved are not well understood. Parallels for the mechanism by which H+-ATPases carry out ATP-dependent proton transport can be drawn from the mechanism proposed for F1F0-ATP synthase hydrolytic function (8Cross R.L. Duncan T.M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 10Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the latter, energy produced from ATP hydrolysis by the catalytic core is thought to drive the rotation of the central stalk. This results in the rotation of the proton channel, which lies adjacent to the a-subunit. The a-subunit is thought to bring the protons to this channel, which releases them on the opposite side of the membrane as it rotates (for review, see Ref. 11Forgac M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it can be seen that the a-subunit is crucial for proton translocation. Although there is no obvious sequence or structural homology between the a-subunits of H+- and F1F0-ATP synthases, functional studies have suggested that they do in fact behave analogously (2Zhang J.

Although the a1 isoform is ubiquitously expressed, a separate gene (ATP6V0A4 in humans) encodes a4, the paralog that is expressed predominantly apically by α-intercalated cells in both human and mouse kidney. Defects in the genes encoding a4 and the osteoclast-enriched a3 isoform (TCIRG1) are associated with the recessively inherited human diseases distal renal tubular acidosis and infantile malignant osteopetrosis, respectively (18Smith A.N.

The H+-ATPase a-subunit is an ∼100-kDa polytopic membrane protein that has a bipartite structure containing an N-terminal hydrophilic domain and a C-terminal hydrophobic domain with 6–9 putative transmembrane helices (14Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T. Hoyt M.A. Preuss D. Mulholland J. Botstein D. Jones E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has not been definitively determined whether the N and C termini lie on the same or opposite sides of the membrane. As noted from the yeast ortholog Vph1p, the N-terminal domain is likely to contribute to the formation of the stator, providing a structural support for the H+-ATPase (3Landolt-Marticorena C. Williams K.M. Correa J. Chen W. Manolson M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15449-15457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Site-directed and random mutagenesis studies of Vph1 showed that mutations in the last two transmembrane regions inhibit both proton transport and ATPase activity (13Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Liu Q. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22487-22493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Also, a cluster of five mutations was identified between residues 800 and 814 in the C-terminal soluble segment, which affected either assembly or stability of the H+-ATPase complex. Two of these mutations may also affect targeting of the a-subunit (22Leng X.H. Manolson M.F. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6717-6723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, Manolson et al. (14Manolson M.F. Proteau D. Preston R.A. Stenbit A. Roberts B.T.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14294-14303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) report that disruption of the a-subunit in yeast affects assembly of V1 onto the vacuolar membrane. Taken together, all these results suggest that in yeast at least, the C-terminal soluble tail of the a-subunit plays a crucial role in function and organization of the ATPase complex. Information concerning potential functional or regulatory contributions of the C-terminal domain of the different tissue-specific isoforms of the mammalian H+-ATPase a-subunit is scarce. We have been particularly interested in the a4 isoform because of its essential contribution to renal acid-base homeostasis. Noting first, the suggested importance of the C terminus to the H+-ATPase as outlined above, and second, that this region is the most homologous among the four a-subunit isoforms, we therefore sought further to explore the role of this domain of human a4 (here designated a4(C) 1The abbreviations used are: a4(C), 45 C-terminal amino acids of the H+-ATPase a4 subunit isoform; a1(C), 45 C-terminal amino acids of the H+-ATPase a1 subunit isoform; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PFK, phosphofructokinase; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate.). We initially used random peptide phage display analysis to identify potential binding partners, followed by both in vitro binding and ex vivo assays. We report here the identification of a new binding partner, phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1), which we also demonstrate interacts with the a1 subunit. The association between these two proteins indicates a direct link between the H+-ATPase and glycolytic pathway via the a-subunit that can furnish the ATP necessary for pump function. a4(C) Construction, Protein Expression, and Purification—cDNA encoding the last 45 amino acids (796–840) of human a4 was amplified by high fidelity PCR using primers (5′-3′) CGGGATCCATGGAGGGCCTCTCTGCTTTC and CCGAATTCCTACTCCTCGGCTGTGCCATC to introduce 5′ BamH1 and 3′ EcoRI restriction sites. These sites were used to clone the gel-purified PCR product in-frame into the GST expression vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Clones containing the fusion construct were identified by both colony PCR and restriction enzyme digestion and verified using ABI Prism® BigDyeTM Terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems). Large scale fermentation was used to express the fusion protein; after an 18-h initial incubation at 37 °C, cultures were diluted 1 in 50 and grown in a fermenter (FT Applikon) for 2.5 h at 37 °C to A600 of 0.8. The incubation temperature was lowered to 30 °C for 30 min; isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added (final concentration 0.1 mm), and incubation was continued for a further 2 h. Bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2250 × g for 10 min and re-suspended in a buffer containing PBS, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, and Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics). Cell lysis was achieved by sonication (Misonix XL2020) for 21 × 10 s. After centrifugation at 44,000 × g for 30 min, the supernatant was collected. To purify the GST fusion protein, the lysate was first passed through a GSTrap pre-packed Column (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The eluate was concentrated using VivaSpin 20 columns (VivaScience) and then subjected to thrombin digestion. Thrombin activity was terminated by twice adding phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.2 mm) at 4 °C for 15 min. After brief centrifugation to remove aggregates, the supernatant was loaded onto a C18 HPLC column (Phenomenex, PRODIGY 5-μm ODS3, 21.2 × 250 mm, 100 Å). Protein was eluted across a gradient of 20–60% CH3CN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The recombinant a4(C) fragment was analyzed for purity and molecular weight by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy (HP1100 coupled with LCQ, Finnigan MAT), lyophilized, and stored at —20 °C. 10 μg each of GST-a4(C) fusion protein eluate, thrombin digest, and the a4(C) protein from HPLC purification were analyzed by Western blotting of a 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel according to standard methods. The blot was probed with the polyclonal antibody RA2922, directed against the last 14 amino acid residues of human a4 as previously described (18Smith A.N. Skaug J. Choate K.A. Nayir A. Bakkaloglu A. Ozen S. Hulton S.A. Sanjad S.A. Al-Sabban E.A. Lifton R.P. Scherer S.W. Karet F.E. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and then followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako). The blot was developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories). a1(C) Synthesis—A 46-amino acid peptide corresponding to the published sequence of the human ATP6V0A1 C terminus (a1(C), GenBankTM Q93050 (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez)) containing an additional N-terminal acetylated cysteine residue was synthesized and HPLC-purified by CovalAb UK Ltd. (Cambridge, UK). Phage Display Screening—Lyophilized purified a4(C) was reconstituted in water and diluted in 0.1 m NaHCO3 (pH 8.6) to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Thereafter, 10 μg were coated onto a micro-plate well at 4 °C overnight in a humidifier. Unbound protein was removed, and the well was blocked with blocking buffer for2hat4 °C with gentle rocking. The Ph.D.-7TM phage display peptide library (New England Biolabs) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. About 2 × 1011 phage virions were added into the blocked well for the first round of panning and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. Bound phages were eluted using glycine buffer (0.2 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.2) containing 1 mg/ml BSA). 1011 amplified phage virions were used for a 2nd and 3rd round of panning. After the 3rd panning, individual phage clones were isolated and characterized by ABI Prism® BigDyeTM terminator cycle sequencing. Protein BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST) was used to search for homology (using the “short nearly exact matches” option) between identified amino acid sequences and protein data base sequences. Phage Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments were carried out essentially under the same conditions as those used in panning procedures of Phage Display, employing 2-fold dilutions of the consensus sequence displaying phage. Nonspecific binding was evaluated in parallel wells lacking a4(C). For detection, HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:5000 in PBST (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2% dried skimmed milk was added into each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. After 6 washes in PBST, bound phages were visualized using 200 μl of 2,2′-azino-bis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sufonic acid) 0.022% (w/v) in 50 mm sodium citrate (pH 4.0) containing 0.05% H2O2. A405 values were measured after 20 min of incubation using a microplate reader (Anthos HTII). PFK-1 Immunoreactivity in Human Kidney—A goat polyclonal antibody direct against rabbit muscle-type PFK-1 (Chemicon International Ltd.) was tested for immunoreactivity against human kidney cytosolic, and membrane protein fractions, which were prepared as previously described (19Smith A.N. Finberg K.E. Wagner C.A. Lifton R.P. Devonald M.A. Su Y. Karet F.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42382-42388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). 10 μg of each sample were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and Western-blotted using α-PFK-1 antibody at 1:2000 dilution. Solubilization of Human Kidney Membrane Proteins and Immunoprecipitation—60 μg of the goat anti-rabbit muscle-type PFK-1 were immobilized onto agarose beads using the Seize Primary Mammalian immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's guidelines. Based on earlier work (23Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 400 μg of human kidney membrane protein prepared as previously described (19Smith A.N. Finberg K.E. Wagner C.A. Lifton R.P.

Chem. 2001; 276: 42382-42388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) were solubilized in a solubilization buffer containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, either 1% n-nonyl-β-d-glucopyranoside or 0.6% CHAPS, and protease inhibitor mixture tablet. All steps were carried out at 4 °C. After gentle rotation for 30 min and centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, 15 μl of unconjugated beads from the same kit were added to the recovered supernatants and incubated for 1 h. These beads were replaced by 50 μl of the PFK-1 antibody-coupled beads before overnight incubation. The beads were then washed 3 times with 1 ml of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaN3, and either 0.3% n-nonyl-β-d-glucopyranoside or 0.3% CHAPS, 3 times with the same buffers containing 500 mm NaCl, and finally, 3 times with buffers without NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted from the agarose beads by boiling in SDS sample buffer (0.175 m Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5.14%(w/v) SDS, 18% (v/v) glycerol, 0.3 m dithiothreitol, 0.006% (w/v) bromphenol blue) at 95 °C, and supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was performed with rabbit RA2922 antibody or anti-PFK-1 antibody as above. Biotinylation of a4(C) or a1(C) and in Vitro Binding of PFK-1—Biotin cadaverine (Molecular Probes) was dissolved in 0.1 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDAC) (Sigma) to a final concentration of 2.4 mg/ml. Purified a4(C) was dissolved at 0.5 mg/ml in H2O. Biotin cadaverine/EDAC solution was added to 25 μg a4(C) solution and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Excess biotin activity was quenched by the addition of 10 μlof1 m sodium acetate (pH 5.0) followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h. Water replaced a4(C) as a control. This protocol was repeated with HPLC-purified synthetic a1(C) peptide. Labeled samples were stored at —20 °C before binding assays. Rabbit muscle-type PFK-1 bound to agarose beads (Sigma) was equilibrated with ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 2 min. Analysis of protein-protein interactions was achieved by incubation of 25 μg of biotin-labeled a4(C) or a1(C) with 50 μl of equilibrated PFK-1-bound agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed (4 × 1 ml) with ice-cold PBST. Bound proteins were eluted from the agarose beads by boiling the beads in SDS sample buffer for 10 min at 95 °C, and supernatants were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. 1:1000 HRP-conjugated avidin (Sigma) was used to probe the membrane according to standard methods. Immunohistochemistry—Samples of normal human kidney were obtained from nephrectomy specimens resected because of renal tumors. Informed written consent was obtained with the approval of the Addenbrooke's hospital histopathology department Tissue Bank Committee. Cortico-medullary sections <1 mm thick were embedded in Tissue-tek OCT compound and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. 5-μm sections were cryostat-cut and thaw-mounted on aminopropyltriethooxsilane-coated glass slides. Sections were stored at —80 °C until use. Sections were fixed in 100% methanol at —20 °C for 5 min and rehydrated by a 5-min immersion in TBST (0.1 m Tris-buffered saline plus 0.001% Tween 20 (pH 7.5). All subsequent incubations and rinses were in TBST. Nonspecific antibody binding was blocked by ambient temperature incubation in blocking buffer containing 10% fetal calf serum in TBST for 15 min. Goat anti-rabbit muscle PFK-1 antibody and rabbit RA2922 antibody were applied at 1:100–1:5000 dilutions in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. TRITC-labeled anti-rabbit or fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-goat secondary antibodies (Vector Laboratories) were applied at 1:100 dilution for 40 min at ambient temperature. After mounting in Citifluor mounting medium, bound antibodies were visualized using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning microscope. Replacement of primary antibody with the appropriate pre-immune serum provided negative controls. Expression and HPLC Purification of a4(C)-GST Fusion Protein—To express a4(C) in bacteria, the coding sequence for this region was ligated in-frame to the coding sequence of GST in the GST-4T-1 expression vector. The GST-a4(C) fusion protein was expressed in this system only at very low levels. Therefore, to obtain sufficient a4(C) protein, a large scale fermentation technique was employed. Western blot analysis using antibody RA2922 (raised against the C-terminal 14 residues of human a4) demonstrated the presence of the fusion protein (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2, before and after thrombin digestion) in both intact and degraded forms. A band corresponding to a4(C) is evident in the post-thrombin-digested sample (lane 2). This thrombin-digested product was subjected to HPLC purification. Fig. 1B demonstrates that of the three main peaks observed, the second peak (arrow) corresponded to the recombinant a4(C). The first peak represented a fraction of smaller mass than expected but was recognized by RA2922 (data not shown), indicating the presence of an alternative thrombin cleavage site within a4(C). The third peak corresponded to non-digested GST-a4(C) fusion protein. As can be seen in Fig. 1C, further passage of the second fraction through an HPLC column linked to a mass spectrophotometer confirmed a single peak representing the a4(C) fragment, with a mass of 5.41 kDa. This corresponded well to the 5.264 kDa predicted by the program Compute pI/Mw tool (us.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html), the difference accounted for by two additional amino acids, Gly and Ser, which were introduced by the BamH1 restriction site. As expected, this fragment was recognized by RA2922 (Fig. 1A, lane 3), further confirming its identity. Phage Display Analysis of a4(C)—A 7-mer random peptide M13 phage display library was used to screen immobilized a4(C) for potential interaction partners. For this purpose recombinant a4(C) protein was fixed to microtiter plates through hydrophobic interactions and subjected to three rounds of “panning” (recovery of bound phage followed by their reapplication for the next round). Sequence analysis of enriched phage clones after the third panning yielded the peptide sequence SWLELRP, which was found in 7 of 17 clones sequenced (Table I). Using the “short nearly exact matches” option, comparative BLAST analysis revealed an almost complete match to the enzyme PFK-1, which is a key participant in the glycolytic pathway. Aligning this sequence with other selected phage clone sequences revealed a longer consensus motif EXWWLKLRP (Table I). This matched region within PFK-1 is highly conserved among mammalian PFK-1 orthologs and paralogs (Table II).Table ISequences of a4(C)-binding peptides selected from M13 phage display libraryPeptide sequencesNo. of clonesSWLELRP7KLWTIKP2EGWHAHT5EXWWLKLRP Open table in a new tab Table IIConservation of the directly identified and the consensus peptide sequence within human, mouse, and rabbit muscle, platelet, and liver PFK-1 isozymesSWLELRPEXWWLKLRPHuman muscle type PFK-1739EQWWLKLRP747Mouse muscle type PFK-1739EQWWLKLRP747Rabbit muscle type PFK-1739EQWWLKLRP747Human platelet type PFK-1748EQWWLKLRP756Mouse platelet type PFK-1747EQWWLKLRP755Rabbit platelet type PFK-1748EQWWLKLRP756Human liver type PFK-1738EQWWLSLRL746Mouse liver type PFK-1738EQWWLNLRL746 Open table in a new tab In Vitro Confirmation of a4(C)-Peptide Interaction—The interaction of a4(C) with the consensus phage 7-mer peptide representing PFK-1 was confirmed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent binding assay (Fig. 2). This showed a significant binding affinity of this peptide to immobilized a4(C) protein. Maximum binding was observed in the range of 1–2 × 1011 phage virions/well, which is similar to the concentration of phage virions used in each of the panning procedures in the phage display procedure. PFK-1 Co-immunoprecipitates with a4 in Human Kidney— Before examining the ex vivo interaction between PFK-1 and the a4 subunit in human kidney, we confirmed that a goat polyclonal antiserum directed against rabbit muscle-type PFK-1 could recognize human PFK-1 in human kidney cytosolic and membrane protein fractions (data not shown). To examine whether a4 and PFK-1 interact in vivo, we next carried out an immunoprecipitation assay using this α-PFK-1 antibody for precipitation and RA2922 for detection. The resulting blot, showing a single major band at ∼116 kDa, recognized by the α-a4 antiserum (Fig. 3A), conforms to previous analysis using this antibody (19Smith A.N. Finberg K.E. Wagner C.A.

An identical blot probed with the α-PFK-1 antiserum revealed a band of the correct size, confirming the presence of the enzyme (Fig. 3B). This demonstration of the co-precipitation of these two proteins indicates their interaction. Interestingly, a4 was present only in the protein sample prepared with n-nonyl-β-d-glucopyranoside as the detergent in both solubilization and washing buffers and not when CHAPS was used (data not shown). Specificity of the assay was confirmed by absence of a4 when the precipitating antibody was omitted (— lanes). PFK-1 Pull-down Assay—We next asked whether the i"

On the basis of sequence similarities with fungal cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) and plant ascorbate peroxidases (APXs), KatGs have been shown to be members of class I of the superfamily of plant, fungal, and bacterial heme peroxidases (1Welinder K.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 388-393Crossref Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Recently, the 2.0-Å; crystal structure of the KatG from the archaebacterium Haloarcula marismortui has been published (2Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It clearly showed that in KatGs the conserved proximal amino acids His, Asp, and Trp and the conserved distal amino acids Trp, Arg, and His have coordinates very similar to CCP and APX (Fig. 1). Despite this homology, class I peroxidases differ in their reactivities toward hydrogen peroxide and one-electron donors as well as in the electronic and spectral features of their redox intermediates. These differences are shown in the generalized reaction scheme of Fig. 2. In the first phase of the catalytic cycles of heme peroxidases and catalases, the ferric enzyme is oxidized by hydrogen peroxide to the redox intermediate compound I, and a water molecule is formed (see Fig. 2, Reaction 1). Compound I is the key oxidizing intermediate and is two oxidizing equivalents above that of the native ferric enzyme with an oxoferryl (FeIV=O) center in combination with either a porphyrin π-cation radical or an amino acid radical (R·+). Ascorbate peroxidases have been shown to form a π-cation radical (3Patterson W.R. Poulos T.L. Goodin D.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4342-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) whereas in CCP Trp-191 is the radical site (4Sivaraja M. Goodin D.B. Mauk A.G. Smith M. Hoffman B.A. Science. 1989; 245: 738-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Generalized reaction scheme of peroxidases. In the first step H2O2 is used for compound I formation (Reaction 1). Compound I is two oxidizing equivalents above that of the native enzyme with a porphyrin π-cation radical in combination with an iron(IV) center or an amino acid radical in combination with iron(IV). Compound I can react with a second H2O2 reducing the enzyme back to the ferric state (Reaction 2, catalase reaction). In the peroxidase reaction compound I is transformed in the first one-electron reduction to compound II containing either an iron(IV) center or an amino acid radical (R·) in combination with iron(III) (Reaction 3). Compound II is finally reduced back to ferric peroxidase in a second one-electron reduction (Reaction 4). Compound III (oxyperoxidase) is formed with excess H2O2. It exists as resonance structure with the iron(III)-superoxide form dominating (12Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The main difference in the enzymatic mechanism between catalases and peroxidases is compound I reduction. In a catalase cycle a second peroxide molecule is used as a reducing agent for compound I regenerating the native enzyme and releasing molecular oxygen (Reaction 2). Catalase-peroxidases have a predominant catalase activity (5Obinger C. Regelsberger G. Strasser G. Burner U. Peschek G.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) whereas no substantial catalase activity has ever been reported for either CCP or APX. Since with hydrogen peroxide compound I reduction (k2) is much faster than compound I formation (k1), even with a stopped-flow machine it is unlikely to monitor compound I formation of wild-type KatG. Thus, under steady-state turnover conditions the ferric redox state dominates (8Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G. Loewen P.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5868-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Furtmüller P.G. Rüker F. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Obinger C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 99-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the role of distal Trp, Arg, and His (Fig. 1) was studied in the KatGs from Escherichia coli (8Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A.

The data presented in these articles suggest that the distal His and Arg in KatGs have a role in the heterolytic cleavage of hydrogen peroxide (Reaction 1) similar to other peroxidases (12Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar). By contrast, the distal Trp has been shown to be essential for H2O2 oxidation, i.e. the two-electron reduction step of compound I back to the ferric protein (Reaction 2). The reasoning for this was based on the observations that in the Trp variants: (i) the catalase activity was significantly reduced (8Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G. Loewen P.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5868-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or even lost (10Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Furtmüller P.G. Rüker F. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Obinger C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22854-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), whereas (ii) the ratio of peroxidase to catalase activity was strongly increased (8Hillar A. Peters B. Pauls R. Loboda A. Zhang H. Mauk A.G. Loewen P.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5868-5875Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 10Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Furtmüller P.G. Rüker F. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Obinger C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 99-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicating that compound I formation was not influenced by this mutation. In the peroxidase reaction compound I is transformed in the first one-electron reduction to compound II containing either an oxoferryl (FeIV=O) center or an amino acid radical (R·+) in combination with FeIII (Fig. 2, Reaction 3). Compound II is finally reduced back to ferric peroxidase in a second one-electron reduction (Reaction 4). Both APXs and CCP cannot perform Reaction 2 and thus reduce compound I via compound II exclusively, thereby oxidizing the preferred electron donors ascorbate and cytochrome c, respectively. By contrast, in the catalase-peroxidases both the peroxidase (Reactions 1, 3, and 4) and the catalase cycle (Reactions 1 and 2) are active. The nature of KatG compound II is unclear. In earlier stopped-flow spectroscopy studies no optical evidence for a typical (red-shifted) oxoferryl-type compound II was observed when electron donors were added to compound I formed by peroxoacetic acid. The resulting intermediate exhibited similar spectral characteristics as the ferric enzyme, which was interpreted as a species containing an oxidized amino acid (R·+) in combination with FeIII (Fig. 2) (10Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Furtmüller P.G. Rüker F. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Obinger C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 99-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Jakopitsch C. Regelsberger G. Furtmüller P.G. Rüker F. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is of note that no EPR evidence of such intermediate has been observed and that rate constants of Reaction 4 in KatGs are unknown so far. The debate about the structural requirements that enable a peroxidase to catalyze H2O2 oxidation (Reaction 2) is still going on. Here, we report on the role of a distal tyrosine, which is found in all catalase-peroxidases sequenced so far, but not in CCP and APX (Fig. 1). Exchange of Tyr-249 in Synechocystis KatG by Phe completely transformed the catalase-peroxidase to a monofunctional peroxidase, which lost its catalase activity but fully retained its peroxidase activity. As a consequence compound I formation (Fig. 1, Reaction 1) could be followed by addition of equimolar H2O2 and the calculated rate constant is shown to be similar to plant-type peroxidases. Hydrogen peroxide oxidation by Y249F (Reaction 2) was negligible, but the peroxidatic cycle was fully active. For the first time a KatG compound II with an oxoferryl-type spectrum was observed allowing the determination of rate constants of both its formation (Reaction 3) and reduction (Reaction 4). The findings are compared with similar reactions of wild-type KatG and other peroxidases and are discussed with respect to the prediction of novel covalent bonds in H. marismortui KatG (2Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), which include the conserved distal tryptophan and tyrosine (Fig. 1), and the recent report about the formation of tyrosyl radical(s) in Mycobacterium tuberculosis KatG during reaction of the resting enzyme with alkyl peroxides (14Chouchane S. Girotto S. Yu S. Magliozzo R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42633-42638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reagents—Standard chemicals and biochemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. at the highest grade available. Expression, purification of KatGs from Synechocystis and spectrophotometric characterization of wild-type and mutant proteins were described previously (6Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 11Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Krois D. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22854-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis—Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was performed using PCR-mediated introduction of silent mutations as described (11Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Krois D. Peschek G.A. Obinger C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22854-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A pET-3a expression vector, that contained the cloned catalase-peroxidase gene from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803 (6Jakopitsch C. Rüker F. Regelsberger G. Dockal M. Peschek G.A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 22854-22861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was used as the template for PCR. At first unique restriction sites were selected flanking the region to be mutated. The flanking primers were 5′-AAT GAT CAG GTA CCG GCC AGT AAA TG-3′ containing a KpnI restriction site and 5′-AGTGCAGACTAGTTCGGAAACG-3′ containing a SpeI restriction site. The following mutant primer with the desired mutation and a silent mutation introducing a restriction site were constructed (point mutations italicized and restriction sites underlined): 5′-TGGGATTAATTTTCGTTAATCCGGAGGGGGT GG-3′ and 5′-CACCCCCTCCGGATTAACGAAAATTAATCCCATTTG-3′ changed Tyr-249 to Phe. The fragment defined by the KpnI and SpeI restriction sites was replaced by the new construct containing the point mutation. The construct was sequenced to verify DNA changes using thermal cycle sequencing. Spectroscopic Studies—Optical spectra were recorded on a diode array spectrophotometer (Zeiss Specord S10) and a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer equipped with a thermostatted cell holder. Circular dichroism studies were carried out using a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter. Far-UV (190-260 nm) experiments were carried out using protein concentrations of 0.15 μm, and the path length of the cuvette was 10 mm. A good signal-to-noise ratio in the CD spectra was obtained by averaging twelve scans (resolution: 1 nm; bandwidth: 1 nm; response 16 s; scan speed 20 nm/min). The protein concentration was calculated from the known amino acid composition and absorption at 280 nm according to Gill and Hippel (15Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5070) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetics—Catalase activity was determined polarographically in 50 mm phosphate buffer using a Clark-type electrode (YSI 5331 Oxygen Probe) inserted into a stirred water bath (YSI 5301B) at 30 °C. Alternatively, the catalase activity was measured by continuously monitoring hydrogen peroxide concentration polarographically with a platinum electrode covered with a hydrophilic membrane and fitted to the Amperometric Biosensor Detector 3001 (Universal Sensors, Inc.). The applied electrode potential at pH 7 was 650 mV, and the H2O2 electrode filling solution was prepared freshly half daily. The electrode was calibrated against known concentrations of hydrogen peroxide. All reactions were performed at 30 °C and started by the addition of KatG. One unit of catalase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of H2O2/min at pH 7 and 30 °C. Peroxidase activity was monitored spectrophotometrically using 1 mm H2O2 (or 1 mm peroxoacetic acid) and 5 mm guaiacol (ϵ470 = 26.6 mm-1 cm-1) or 1 mmo-dianisidine (ϵ460 = 11.3 mm-1 cm-1) or 1 mm tyrosine (ϵ315 = 3.6 mm-1 cm-1) or 1 mm ascorbate (ϵ290 = 2.8 mm-1cm-1). Peroxidase activity with pyrogallol was monitored using 100 μm H2O2 and 20 mm pyrogallol (ϵ430 = 2.47 mm-1 cm-1). One unit of peroxidase is defined as the amount that decomposes 1 μmol of electron donor/min at pH 7 and 30 °C. Steady-state spectrophotometric measurements were made on a diode-array spectrophotometer Specord S10 (Zeiss) and a Hitachi Model U-3000 spectrophotometer, respectively. Transient State Kinetics—Transient state measurements were made using the model SX-18MV stopped-flow spectrophotometer from Applied Photophysics equipped with a 1-cm observation cell thermostatted at 15 °C. Calculation of pseudo first-order rate constants (kobs) from experimental traces at the Soret maximum was performed with the SpectraKinetic work station v4.38 interfaced to the instrument. The kinetics of oxidation of ferric KatG to compound I by hydrogen peroxide and peroxoacetic acid (POA) was followed in the single mixing mode at 407 nm. Ferric KatG and the peroxide were mixed to give a final concentration of 1 μm enzyme and 1-20 μm H2O2 or 5-35 μm peroxoacetic acid. The first data point was recorded 1.5 ms after mixing, and 2000 data points were accumulated. Second-order rate constants were calculated from the slope of the linear plot of pseudo first-order rate constants versus substrate concentration. Sequential-mixing stopped-flow analysis was used to measure compound I reduction by one-electron donors. In the first step the enzyme was mixed with equimolar H2O2 and, after a delay time of 100 ms where compound I was built, the intermediate was mixed with the electron donors ascorbate and tyrosine. The kinetics of compound II formation was monitored at 418 nm, the wavelength of maximum absorbance of Y249F compound II. The kinetic traces were fitted using the single exponential equation of the Applied Photophysics software and, from the slopes of the linear plots of the kobs values versus substrate concentration, the apparent second-order rate constants were obtained by linear square regression analysis. Reduction of Y249F compound II by tyrosine or ascorbate was monitored by using the following procedures. The ferric protein (4 μm) was premixed with equimolar concentration of hydrogen peroxide in 100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). After a delay time of 10 s, the formed compound II was allowed to react with varying concentrations of reducing substrates in the same buffer. The reactions were followed at 418 nm (disappearance of compound II) or at 407 nm (formation of the ferric KatG). Alternatively, 4 μm ferric KatG was premixed with equimolar concentration of hydrogen peroxide and after a delay time of 100 ms, compound I was allowed to react with varying concentrations of reducing substrates in the same buffer. The reactions were once again measured at 418 nm. The resulting biphasic curves showed the initial formation of compound II and then its subsequent reaction with ascorbate or tyrosine causing an exponential decrease in absorbance. All reactions were also investigated using the diode-array detector (Applied Photophysics PD.1) attached to the stopped-flow machine and the XScan Diode Array Scanning v1.07 software. Typically, in these experiments the KatG concentration was higher (e.g. 5 μm in the optical cell). Normal spectral data sets were also analyzed using the Pro-K simulation program from Applied Photophysics, which allows the synthesis of artificial sets of time dependent spectra as well as spectral analysis of enzyme intermediates. EPR Spectroscopy—Conventional 9-GHz EPR measurements were performed using a Bruker ER 300 spectrometer with a standard TE102 cavity equipped with a liquid helium cryostat (Oxford Instrument) and a microwave frequency counter (Hewlett Packard 5350B). Typically, the compound I samples were prepared by mixing manually 2.0 mm native enzyme (100 mm Tris/maleate buffer, pH 8.0) with an excess (10-fold) of peroxoacetic acid, directly in the 4-mm EPR tubes kept at 0 °C. The reaction was stopped by rapid immersion of the EPR tube in liquid nitrogen after 10 s. Sequence analysis of all as yet published katG genes as well as inspection of the recently published three-dimensional structure of H. marismortui KatG shows the existence of a conserved distal side tyrosine (Fig. 1). Based on the observation of continuous electron densities in the x-ray structure it was suggested that this tyrosine is covalently bonded to adjacent tryptophan and methionine (2Yamada Y. Fujiwara T. Sato T. Igarashi N. Tanaka N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 691-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In detail, bonds between Cϵ1 of Tyr-218 (Haloarcula numbering) and Cϵ2 of distal Trp-95 as well as between Cϵ2 of Tyr-218 and Sδ of Met-244 were suggested, though tryptic digestion and mass spectrometry of the reaction products were unable to prove definitely the existence of these covalent bonds in Haloarcula KatG. Neither in CCP nor in APXs this distal tyrosine is found, whereas the distal methionine is found in all KatGs and APXs but not in CCP (Fig. 1B). Fig. 3 depicts the UV-Vis and CD spectra of wild-type KatG and the variant Y249F investigated in this study. In the electronic absorption spectrum of ferric wild-type KatG, both the Soret and the CT1 band (637 nm) suggest the presence of a 5-c HS heme coexisting with a 6-c HS heme (16Heering H.A. Indiani C. Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Obinger C. Smulevich G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9237-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In Y249F the shoulder at about 380 nm increases in intensity and the CT1 band red-shifts indicating an increase of the 5-c HS heme at the expense of 6-c HS heme. The A406/A280 ratios (i.e. Reinheitszahl) of Y249F varied between 0.49 and 0.52 compared with 0.57 and 0.61 of the wild-type protein. Thus, the Reinheitszahl of Y249F was comparable to that of other KatG variants produced so far (10Regelsberger G. Jakopitsch C. Furtmüller P.G. Rüker F. Switala J. Loewen P.C. Obinger C. Biochem.

Biochem. 2002; 91: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The protein yield was 50 - 80 mg of recombinant KatG from 1 liter of E. coli culture for both wild type and Y249F. The CD spectra of wild-type KatG and Y249F (Fig. 3B) are characteristic of a protein composed primarily of α-helices. Very little difference was observed between wild-type KatG and the variant. If conformational changes did occur, they must have been very localized and thus undetectable by CD experiments. Catalase and Peroxidase Activity—Recombinant wild-type KatG exhibits an overwhelming catalase activity. The polarographically measured specific catalase activity in the presence of 5 mm hydrogen peroxide is (1160 ± 55) units/mg of protein. For wild-type Synechocystis KatG a turnover number (kcat) of 3500 s-1 and a kcat/Km rate of 8.5 × 105m-1 s-1 was determined which underscores the singular status KatGs have among the heme peroxidase superfamily. However, exchange of Tyr-249 led to an almost complete loss of catalase activity. With a calculated turnover number of (6 ± 3) s-1 more than 99.8% of wild-type catalase activity was lost, and the remaining catalase activity was now similar to that determined for various horseradish peroxidase isoenzymes (2Yamada Y.

Most interesting was the finding that upon addition of micromolar hydrogen peroxide (1-5 μm) to 1 μm ferric Y249F KatG a red-shift in the absorbance spectrum was observed in a conventional spectrophotometer (Fig. 4). The resulting absorption bands at 418, 530, and 558 nm suggested the formation of a redox intermediate with spectral features similar to that of an oxoferryl-like compound II (12Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar). By contrast, in wild-type KatG the dominating redox intermediate spectrum during H2O2 degradation (10-1000 μm) has spectral features very similar to that of the ferric enzyme (8Hillar A. Peters B.

Addition of higher concentrations of H2O2 (>10 μm) to ferric Y249F KatG led to the formation of an oxyferrous-like (compound III) intermediate (12Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. Wiley-VCH, New York1999Google Scholar), as indicated by the appearance of absorption bands at 414, 542, and 576 nm (Fig. 4). A comparable transition of native wild-type Mycobacterium KatG to compound III has been reported (9Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), but in these experiments very high concentrations (0.4 m) of hydrogen peroxide had to be added in order to produce a compound III spectrum with peaks at 418, 545, and 580 nm (9Chouchane S. Lippai I. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9975-9983Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In the presence of peroxidase substrates the dominating redox intermediate had spectral features typical for an oxoferryl-type compound II (418, 530, and 558 nm).

Bone is a dynamic connective tissue, undergoing modeling and remodeling. During modeling, bone is formed in two different ways, intramembranous ossification and endochondral ossification. In intramembranous ossification, condensing cells differentiate into osteoblasts, whereas in endochondral ossification, condensing cells differentiate into chondrocytes to form cartilage, later replaced by bone. It has been suggested that osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myoblasts are derived from common precursor cells (1Fang J. Hall B.K. Anat. Embryol. 1997; 196: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which are multipotential mesenchymal stem cells derived from mesoderm. The differentiation of multipotential mesenchymal stem cells into a distinct cell lineage is termed “commitment,”and their commitment to the osteoblast lineage as well as their differentiation and maturation that follow are necessary for both bone modeling and remodeling. These sequential events are regulated both systemically and locally by several hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. Moreover, transcription factors, such as Runx2/cbfa1 (Runx2), Fra-1, and Osx, are important for osteoblastic differentiation (2Jochum W. David J.P. Elliott C. Wutz A. Plenk Jr., H. Matsuo K.

Menin is the product of the MEN1 gene (6Larsson C. Skogseid B. Oberg K. Nakamura Y. Nordenskjold M. Nature. 1988; 332: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), responsible for the multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1, an autosomal dominant cancer syndrome characterized by multiple tumors of the parathyroid, endocrine pancreas, and the anterior pituitary. Over 250 independent germ line and somatic mutations scattered throughout the protein-coding region have been identified (7Agarwal S.K. Kester M.B. Debelenko L.V. Heppner C. Emmert-Buck M.R. Skarulis M.C. Doppman J.L. Kim Y.S. Lubensky I.A. Zhuang Z. Green J.S. Guru S.C. Manickam P. Olufemi S.E. Liotta L.A. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Collins F.S. Spiegel A.M. Burns A.L. Marx S.J. Hum. Mol.

Most of the mutations are clearly inactivating, leading to a truncated product. This would be consistent with menin acting as a tumor suppressor gene and a complete lack of menin, caused by the loss of both alleles, resulting in tumor development (6Larsson C. Skogseid B. Oberg K. Nakamura Y. Nordenskjold M. Nature. 1988; 332: 85-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). The human MEN1 gene encodes a 610-amino acid protein with homology to no known protein. Two novel nuclear localization signal sequences have been identified in the carboxyl-terminal portion of menin protein, which has been demonstrated to be predominantly located in the nucleus (9Guru S.C.

We recently demonstrated that menin interacts with Smad3 and that inactivation of menin blocks transforming growth factor type β (TGF-β) signaling by inhibiting Smad3/4-DNA binding at specific transcriptional regulatory sites (15Kaji H. Canaff L. Lebrun J.J. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3837-3842Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). These data implicate a mechanism of tumorigenesis by menin inactivation. However, the physiological functions of menin remain unknown. Several studies revealed that menin is widely expressed in mouse tissues and is found in both nonendocrine and endocrine tissues (16Ikeo Y. Sakurai A. Suzuki R. Zhang M.X. Koizumi S. Takeuchi Y.

Libutti S.K. Chandrasekharappa S.C. Marx S.J. Spiegel A.M. Collins F.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) reported that homozygous menin inactivation in mice was embryonic lethal and some fetuses exhibited clear defects in cranial and facial development, whereas the heterozygous phenotype was strikingly similar to that of the human disorder MEN1, and endocrine tumors developed later in life. Since cranial bones are formed by intramembranous ossification, these findings suggested the possibility that menin might play an important role in commitment from multipotential mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblast lineage and osteoblastic differentiation. We therefore investigated the effects of menin inactivation with anti-sense menin oligonucleotides (AS-oligo) on bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)-induced differentiation in mouse C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) cells as a model for the commitment of undetermined multipotential mesenchymal stem cells into osteoblast lineage. We also examined the osteoblast phenotype by using mouse osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells in which antisense-menin (AS) was stably expressed as a model for osteoblastic differentiation. Materials—Anti-type I collagen antibody was from Calbiochem, and anti-type IX collagen antibody was from LSL Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Human recombinant BMP-2 was kindly provided by Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Retinoic acid and human recombinant TGF-β1 were from Sigma. The menin rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against a decapentapeptide (synthesized by solid-phase chemistry at the Peptide Synthesis Facility of the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre of McGill University) corresponding to amino acids 476–489 of menin (a sequence that is completely conserved between human and mouse) with an additional cysteine residue at the carboxyl-terminus. The peptide was coupled through the cysteine residue to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antiserum was immunoaffinity-purified before use, and, by Western blot of a variety of cell lines of different species, it recognized human and rodent menin with similar affinity (10Kaji H. Canaff L. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5097-5101PubMed Google Scholar). 24-base pair phosphorothioate-derivatized antisense and sense menin oligonucleotides (AS- and S-oligos) were synthesized on an automated solid phase synthesizer (Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility of the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre of McGill University) by using standard phosphoramide chemistry. The sequence of the AS-oligo was 5′-GGCCTTC-AGCCCCATGGCGGCGGG-3′, and that of the S-oligo was 5′-CCCGC-CGCCATGGGGCTGAAGGCC-3′. These sequences are identical in human and rodent menin. All chemicals used were of analytical grade. Cell Culture—C3H10T1/2 (10T1/2) murine mesenchymal progenitor cells were grown in Eagle's basal medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). BMP-2 induced 10T1/2 cell adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation without additional reagents specific to adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, as previously described by others (19Bostrom K.

DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MC3T3-E1 cells, a clonal osteoblastic cell line isolated from calvariae of late stage mouse embryo (21Sudo H. Kodama H.A. Amagai Y. Yamamoto S. Kasai S. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar), and the two bone marrow stromal cell lines, ST2 and MC3T3-G2/PA6 (PA6) cells, were cultured in α-minimum essential medium (MEM) (containing 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid). These media were supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) and changed twice a week. For the mineralization assay, MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma) for 2 weeks after reaching confluence. For immunoprecipitation experiments, African green monkey COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. Construction of Expression Plasmids and Stable Transfection—The human menin cDNA was constructed as previously described (10Kaji H. Canaff L. Goltzman D. Hendy G.N. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5097-5101PubMed Google Scholar). Rat FLAG-tagged Smad1 and Smad5 were subcloned from pcDNA3 to pCMV-Tag 2A and pCMV-Tag 2B, respectively. For the antisense menin construct, human menin DNA was cloned in an antisense orientation into the EcoRI site of pcDNA3.1(+). Antisense menin cDNA (AS-DNA) and empty vector (V) (each 3 μg) were transfected into MC3T3-E1 cells with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 6 h after transfection, the cells were fed with fresh α-MEM containing 10% FBS. After 48 h, cells were passaged, and clones were selected in α-MEM supplemented with G418 (0.3 mg/ml) (Invitrogen) and 10% FBS. Reduced expression of menin by AS-DNA was detected with Western blot analysis, using the polyclonal anti-menin antibody. To rule out the possibility of clonal variation, we characterized at least three independent clones for each transfection. V-transfected cells were used as the control. We constructed a heterologous luciferase reporter termed 3GC2-Lux, containing three copies of the GC-rich sequences flanked by two adenine residues inserted into 90COLXLUC (gift of S. Harada) containing the core promoter of the mouse collagen X gene in pGL2-Basic, as described (22Ishida W. Hamamoto T. Kusanagi K. Yagi K. Kawabata M. Takehara K. Sampath T.K. Kato M. Miyazono K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6075-6079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The transfection of 3GC2-Lux into ST2 and MC3T3-E1 cells was performed as described above. Luciferase Assay—Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105/six-well plate. 24 h later, cells were transfected with 3 μg of the reporter plasmid (p3TP-Lux or 3GC2-Lux) and the pCH110 plasmid expressing β-galactosidase (1 μg) using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). 15 h later, the medium was changed to a 4% FBS-containing medium, and the cells were incubated for an additional 9 h. Thereafter, the cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of TGF-β in the medium containing 0.2% FBS. The cells were lysed, and the luciferase activity was measured and normalized to the relative β-galactosidase activity, as previously described (23Lebrun J.J. Takabe K. Chen Y. Vale W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Protein Extraction, Co-immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—Cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, complete protease inhibitor mixture, 1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were stored at -80 °C. Protein quantitation was performed with BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of proteins were denatured in SDS sample buffer and separated on 10% polyacrylamide-SDS gels. Proteins were transferred in 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol to polyvinylidene difluoride. Blots were blocked with TBS (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 137 mm NaCl) plus 0.1% Tween 20 containing 3% dried milk powder. The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using the appropriate secondary antibodies (Sigma) and the enhanced chemiluminescence detection system, as recommended by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For all experiments, 20 μg of protein was applied to each lane. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed with a buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholate, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, plus a protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min at 4 °C, and insoluble materials were separated by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant containing 1 mg of protein was clarified and incubated with anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma) on a rocking platform at 4 °C overnight. The immune complexes were collected with Protein G Plus/Protein A-agarose beads (Calbiochem) for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer, resuspended in 2× sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. RNA Extraction and Northern Blot Analysis—RNA was prepared with TrizolR reagent (Invitrogen). Northern blot analysis was performed, as previously described (24Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36024-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In brief, 20-μg aliquots of total RNA were denatured, electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels containing 2% formaldehyde, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and fixed with UV light. Membranes were hybridized to a 32P (Amersham Biosciences)-labeled DNA probe overnight at 42 °C. The hybridization probes were type I collagen (COLI) (a gift from Dr. T. Kimura, Osaka University, Japan) and mouse OCN. After hybridization, the filters were washed twice with saline citrate containing SDS and exposed to x-ray film. All values were normalized for RNA loading by probing blots with human β-actin cDNA (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—Reverse transcription of 5 μg of cultured cell total RNA was carried out for 50 min at 42 °C and then 15 min at 70 °C, using the SuperScript™ first strand synthesis system for RT-PCR (Invitrogen), which contained RT buffer, oligo(dT)12–18, 5× first strand solution, 10 mm dNTP, 0.1 m dithiothreitol, SuperScript II (RT-enzyme), and RNase H (RNase inhibitor). PCR using primers to unique sequences in each cDNA was carried out in a volume of 10 μl of reaction mixture for PCR (as supplied by TaKaRa, Otsu, Japan), supplemented with 2.5 units of TaKaRa Taq™, 1.5 mm each dNTP (TaKaRa), and PCR buffer (10×), which contained 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 500 mm KCl, and 15 mm MgCl2. 25 ng of each primer and 1 μl of template (from a 50-μl RT reaction) were used. Thermal cycling conditions and primer sequences are described below: 1) initial denaturation at 96 °C for 2 min; 2) cycling for cDNA-specific number of cycles (96 °C for 1 min, cDNA-specific annealing temperature for 2 min, and 72 °C for 2 min); and 3) final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Primer sequences, annealing temperature, and cycle numbers were as follows: COLI, 5′- GCAATCGGGATCAGTACGAA-3′ and 5′- CTTTCACGCCTTTGAAGCCA-3′ (61 °C; 37 cycles); OPN, 5′- TCACCATTCGGATGAGTCTG-3′ and 5′- ACTTGTGGCTCTGATGTTCC-3′ (47 °C; 30 cycles); Runx2, 5′-CAGGAAGACTGCAAGAAGGCTCTGG-3′ and 5′-ACACGGTGTCACTGCGCTGAAGA-3′ (62 °C; 25 cycles); OCN, 5′-CTCTGTCTCTCTGACCTCACAG-3′ and 5′-GGAGCTGCTGTGACATCCATAC-3′ (53 °C; 28 cycles); PPARγ, 5′-GCTGTTATGGGTGAAACTCTG-3′ and 5′-ATAAGGTGGAGATGCAGGTTC-3′ (58 °C; 29 cycles); glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GA-PDH), 5′-ATCCCATCACCATCTTCCAGGAG-3′ and 5′-CCTGCTTCACCACCTTCTTGATG-3′ (47 °C; 24 cycles) (19Bostrom K. Tsao D. Shen S. Wang Y. Demer L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14044-14052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For semiquantitative RT-PCR, the number of cycles was chosen so that amplification remained well within the linear range, as assessed by densitometry (NIH Image J, version 1.08i, public domain program). An equal volume from each PCR was analyzed by 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and ethidium bromide-stained PCR products were evaluated. Marker gene expression was normalized to GAPDH expression in each sample. Assay of ALP Activity and ALP Stain—ALP activity was assayed by a method modified from that of Lowry et al. (26Lowry O.H. Anal. Biochem. 1954; 17: 19-23Google Scholar). In brief, the assay mixtures contained 0.1 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (Sigma), 1 mm MgCl2, 8 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium, and cell homogenates. After a 3-min incubation at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped with 0.1 n NaOH, and the absorbance was read at 405 nm. A standard curve was prepared with p-nitrophenol (Sigma). Each value was normalized to the protein concentration. ALP staining was performed by a standard protocol. In brief, cultured cells were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 100% methanol, rinsed with PBS, and then overlaid with 1.5 ml of 0.15 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate (Invitrogen) plus 0.3 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Invitrogen) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 0.01 n NaOH, 0.05 m MgCl2, followed by incubation at room temperature for 2 h in the dark. Oil Red Staining and Alcian Blue Staining—In order to evaluate adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation, cell layers were rinsed with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 20% formaldehyde, and stained with Oil red and Alcian blue (Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan), respectively. Mineralization Assay—Mineralization of MC3T3-E1 cells was determined in six-well and 12-well plates using von Kossa staining and Alizarin red staining, respectively. The cells were fixed with 95% ethanol and stained with AgNO3 by the von Kossa method. At the same time, the other plates were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol and stained with Alizarin red (Sigma). For quantitation, cells stained with Alizarin red were destained with ethylpyridinium chloride (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), and then the extracted stain was transferred to a 96-well plate, and the absorbance at 562 nm was measured using a microplate reader, as previously described (24Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2002; 17: 1190-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 25Sowa H. Kaji H. Yamaguchi T. Sugimoto T. Chihara K. J. Biol.

Statistical analysis was performed using an unpaired t test or analysis of variance. Menin Expression and Effects of Menin AS-oligo in 10T1/2 Cells—Menin is widely expressed in mammalian tissues (27Wautot V. Khodaei S. Frappart L. Buisson N. Baro E. Lenoir G.M. Calender A. Zhang C.X. Weber G. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 85: 877-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We examined the expression of menin in 10T1/2 mouse mesenchymal stem cells by Western blot analysis. Menin was expressed at the confluent stage, culture day 7, and the expression was increased by treatment with BMP-2 until culture day 14 and declined thereafter (Fig. 1A). Some osteoblastic phenotypes in 10T1/2 cells are shown in Fig. 1, B and C. The level of menin expression was higher when the levels of COLI and OPN expression were elevated, and it was lower when OCN expression was elevated. These results suggested that menin played an important role in the early differentiation stage of osteoblasts. The production of ALP was increased by the treatment with BMP-2 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1D). Treatment with AS-oligo for 12 h suppressed the expression of endogenous menin in 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 1E). Effects of Menin Inactivation on BMP-2-induced Osteoblastic Differentiation in 10T1/2 Cells—When treated with BMP-2, 10T1/2 cells undergo commitment into the osteoblastic lineage and osteoblastic differentiation (28Katagiri T. Yamaguchi A. Ikeda T. Yoshiki S. Wozney J.M. Rosen V. Wang E.A. Tanaka H. Omura S. Suda T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 172: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). To investigate the effects of menin inactivation by AS-oligo on BMP-2-induced osteoblastic commitment in 10T1/2 cells, we first examined the effects of AS-oligo on the expression of COLI and ALP activity in 10T1/2 cells. As shown in Fig. 2, AS-oligo specifically antagonized the expression of COLI mRNA (Fig. 2A) and COLI protein (Fig. 2B) induced by BMP-2, although S-oligo did not affect these parameters. Moreover, AS-oligo concentration-dependently antagonized ALP activity stimulated by BMP-2 in 10T1/2 cells (Fig 3, A–C). However, AS-oligo did not affect retinoic acid-induced ALP activity in 10T1/2 cells (Fig. 3D), suggesting that although menin was inactivated, retinoic acid signaling was intact and that menin specifically related to BMP-2-signaling.Fig. 3Effects of menin inactivation on ALP activity and staining in 10T1/2 cells.A shows ALP staining in 10T1/2 cells. After reaching confluence, the cells were fed fresh medium. The cells were pretreated with 100 ng/ml AS- or S-oligo for 6 h. Then cells were fed fresh medium with or without 100 ng/ml AS- or S-oligo in the presence and absence of BMP-2 (100 ng/ml). 48 h later, ALP staining was performed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B shows ALP activity in 10T1/2 cells. 10T1/2 cells were cultured as in A, and ALP activity was measured, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the mean ± S.E.

https://openalex.org/W1997643376,"Hydrogen peroxide can interact with the active site of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) to generate a powerful oxidant. This oxidant can either damage amino acid residues at the active site, inactivating the enzyme (the self-oxidative pathway), or oxidize substrates exogenous to the active site, preventing inactivation (the external oxidative pathway). It is well established that the presence of bicarbonate anion dramatically enhances the rate of oxidation of exogenous substrates. Here, we show that bicarbonate also substantially enhances the rate of self-inactivation of human wild type SOD1. Together, these observations suggest that the strong oxidant formed by hydrogen peroxide and SOD1 in the presence of bicarbonate arises from a pathway mechanistically distinct from that producing the oxidant in its absence. Self-inactivation rates are further enhanced in a mutant SOD1 protein (L38V) linked to the fatal neurodegenerative disorder, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. The 1.4 Å resolution crystal structure of pathogenic SOD1 mutant D125H reveals the mode of oxyanion binding in the active site channel and implies that phosphate anion attenuates the bicarbonate effect by competing for binding to this site. The orientation of the enzyme-associated oxyanion suggests that both the self-oxidative and external oxidative pathways can proceed through an enzyme-associated peroxycarbonate intermediate.

Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1, 1The abbreviations used are: SOD1, superoxide dismutase 1; CuZn-SOD, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase; HO·, hydroxyl radical; DMPO, 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyroline N-oxide; DCFH, dichlorodihydrofluorescein; FALS, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; SCN, thiocyanate; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. CuZn-SOD) is a 32-kDa homodimeric protein that catalyzes the disproportionation of superoxide anion into dioxygen and hydrogen peroxide (2O2˙−+2H+→O2+H2O2) through redox cycling of its catalytic copper ion (1Fridovich I.

Copper Transport and Its Disorders: Molecular and Cellular Aspects. Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology. 448. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Norwell, MA1999: 193-203Google Scholar). Each subunit of the enzyme contains a progressively narrowing channel lined with charged residues that guide O2˙− toward the active site (3Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Beem K.M. Richardson J.S.

Immediately adjacent to the copper ion, the channel constricts and the guanidinium group of Arg-143 and the side chain of Thr-137 together act to exclude large nonsubstrate anions (5Bertini I. Mangani S. Viezzoli M.S. Adv. Inorg. Chem. 1998; 45: 127-251Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Small anions such as cyanide (CN-) and azide (N3−) can proceed past this channel constriction and competitively inhibit the enzyme by binding directly to the copper ion (6Rigo A. Viglino P. Rotilio G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 63: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Certain larger anions such as hydrogen phosphate (HPO4−2) are also pulled into the active site channel but do not bind tightly to the copper. Instead, they remain associated with Arg-143 in the “anion-binding site” approximately 5 Å away (7Mota de Freitas D. Luchinat C. Banci L. Bertini I. Valentine J.S. Inorg. Chem. 1987; 26: 2788-2791Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In addition to its well known O2˙− disproportionation activity, the active site of CuZn-SOD can interact with H2O2 to generate a powerful oxidant (8Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 9Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H. Holcman J. J. Biol.

In the first, designated herein as the self-oxidative pathway, it can inactivate CuZn-SOD by damaging nearby active site histidine copper ligands, resulting in copper loss (11Bray R.C. Cockle S.A.

In the second, designated as the external oxidative pathway, the oxidant instead reacts with exogenous substrates, protecting the enzyme from inactivation (8Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 10Yim M.B. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The following reaction scheme has been proposed for these pathways as shown in Reaction 1, Reaction 2, Reaction 3, SOD-Cu(II)+H2O2→SOD-Cu(I)+2H++O2˙−Reaction 1 SOD−Cu(I)+H2O2→SOD−Cu(II)(⋅OH)+OH−Reaction 2 SOD−Cu(II)(⋅OH)+XH→SOD−Cu(II)+H2O+H⋅Reaction 3 where XH represents amino acids at the active site or an exogenous substrate (8Hodgson E.K.

Analogous to the Fenton reaction, Reaction 2 generates a highly reactive hydroxyl radical (HO·). The observation that this HO· does not readily react with scavengers of free HO· such as ethanol led to the proposal that the HO· was “bound” to the catalytic copper ion. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that small anions such as formate (HCO2−) and N3− that can traverse the active site channel constriction and gain close approach to the copper ion are able to protect the enzyme from inactivation by serving as sacrificial substrates (8Hodgson E.K. Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 9Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H. Holcman J. J. Biol.

Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5299-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity of SOD1 is not strictly limited to small substrates that can gain direct access to the copper ion. In the presence of bicarbonate anion (HCO3−), larger reporter molecules such as DMPO (5,5-dimethyl-1-pyroline N-oxide), ABTS (2,2′-azino-bis-[3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonate]), PBN (N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone), azulenyl nitrone, tyrosine, and DCFH (dichlorodihydrofluorescein) are also oxidized (10Yim M.B.

This expanded FALS SOD1 peroxidase activity exerted either on substrates critical for motor neuron viability or on the SOD1 molecule itself could play a role in FALS etiology (see “Discussion”). It is important to note that the oxidation of substrates too large to traverse the active site channel constriction can occur only in the presence of HCO3− or structurally similar anions such as HSeO3− and HSO3−. Other anions such as N3−, HCO2−, HPO4−2, thiocyanate (SCN-), nitrate (NO3−), and Cl- do not appear to support the oxidation of these larger substrates (16Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The relevance of this activity is underscored by the significant concentration of HCO3− found in vivo (∼25 mm) (28Levinski A.M. Maral J. Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine. 13th Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc, New York1983Google Scholar) and by recent studies showing that at physiological pH values (7.4) and low H2O2 concentrations (1 μm), HCO3− dramatically enhances DCFH oxidation in a SOD1/H2O2/DCFH system (23Zhang H. Joseph J. Gurney M. Becker D. Kalyanaraman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1013-1020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Several laboratories have sought to delineate the mechanistic role of HCO3− in the external oxidative pathway of SOD1. Sankarapandi and Zweier (16Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) propose that HCO3− bound to the SOD1 anion-binding site creates a hydrogen-bonding template for H2O2 near the copper ion that facilitates its partitioning into ·OH and OH- (see Reaction 2). Liochev and Fridovich (17Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggest that if this were true, then both the rate of endogenous SOD1 self-inactivation and the rate of oxidation of larger exogenous substrates in Reaction 3 should be enhanced by the presence of HCO3−. To test this hypothesis, they (17Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) monitored the rate of self-inactivation of SOD1 in 100 mm phosphate buffer and observed no significant rate enhancement when 10 mmHCO3− was added. On this basis, they suggested that HCO3− does not facilitate H2O2 binding, but rather, HCO3− can itself be oxidized by the copper-bound HO· to carbonate radical anion (CO3⋅−), which in turn can diffuse from the active site channel to oxidize larger, bulky, exogenous substrates (Reactions 6 and 7) or remain associated with the anion-binding site to oxidize histidine copper ligands (Reactions 8 and 9) (17Liochev S.I.

Fridovich I. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 5294-5299Crossref Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 9Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H. Holcman J. J. Biol.

A. 1990; 87: 5006-5010Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Here, we test the effect of HCO3− on the rate of self-inactivation in the absence of other oxyanions that might compete for binding to the anion-binding site (e.g. phosphate). We find that the rate of self-inactivation of wild type SOD1 is significantly enhanced under these conditions rather than diminished. Thus, the strong oxidant produced in this experiment arises from a pathway that is mechanistically distinct from Reactions 2 and 6. We also show that the human Leu-38 to Val (L38V) FALS SOD1 protein demonstrates increased rates of self-inactivation relative to the wild type protein whether HCO3− is present or not. Finally, x-ray crystallographic analysis of the human Asp-125 to His (D125H) FALS SOD1 protein suggests a mechanism for both the self-oxidative and external oxidative pathways that proceeds through an enzyme-associated peroxycarbonate (HCO4−) intermediate. This chemistry has direct relevance to the understanding of SOD1-mediated oxidative cellular damage and how members of the “wild type-like” and “metal-binding region” mutant classes of FALS SOD1 proteins can be fused into a single class of molecules that are toxic to motor neurons (for review see Ref. 29Valentine J.S. Hart P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Materials—All of the solutions were prepared using distilled water passed through a Millipore ultrapurification system. EDTA was purchased from Sigma. pH was adjusted by the addition of H2SO4 (double distilled from Vycor, GFC Chemical Co.) and NaOH (Puratronic, Baker Chemical Co.). Monobasic phosphate buffer (Ultrex, JT Baker Co.) at a concentration of 100 mm was used in all of the measurements requiring phosphate. Sodium bicarbonate (EM Science) at a concentration of either 10 or 25 mm was used in all of the measurements that required bicarbonate anion. Solutions buffered using 0.5 mm Tris were adjusted with 100 mm sodium chloride to negate the effect of shifts in ionic strength between experiments with and without bicarbonate anion. Hydrogen peroxide was of the highest purity (The Olin Corporation). The concentration of hydrogen peroxide was measured by the titration against iodate and by its absorbance at 230 nm (extinction coefficient = 61 m-1 cm-1). Ethanol was purchased from Quantum Chemical Co. Expression and Purification of Wild type and L38V SOD1—Human wild type and L38V SOD1 proteins were expressed in insect cells and purified as described previously (30Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15923-15931Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The metallation states of protein samples were not altered following purification. SOD1 protein concentrations were determined using an extinction coefficient of 1.08 × 104m-1 cm-1 for the purified enzyme. Purity was estimated using SDS-PAGE and electrospray mass spectrometry. Metal content analyses were performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry techniques. Pulse Radiolysis Experiments—Pulse radiolysis experiments were performed using the 2 MeV Van de Graaff accelerator at Brookhaven National Laboratory. Dosimetry was established using the KSCN dosimeter, assuming that (SCN)2− is generated with a G value of 6.13 and has a molar absorptivity of 7950 m-1 cm-1 at 472 nm. Irradiation of water by an electron beam generates the primary radicals, ·OH, eaq−, and ·H. These radicals are efficiently converted into O2˙− in the presence of ethanol and oxygen by the following reactions: ·OH + H3CCH2OH → H2O + H3CC·HOH followed by H3C⋅HOH+O2→H3CCO⋅HOH+O2˙− and eaq−+O2˙−→O2˙−,H+O2→HO2, where HO2→H++O2˙−. The decay of O2˙− was monitored at 250–270 nm. An observed first order rate for the catalytic dismutation of O2˙− in the presence of SOD was extracted from the observed change in absorbance (at 260 nm) with respect to time. The reported rate constants for the studies were calculated by dividing the observed rate by the total concentration of copper bound to the enzyme in solution for CuZn-SOD. A set of self-inactivation experiments were carried out in the presence and absence of 100 mm phosphate at pH 7.2 and 25 °C to facilitate comparison with the studies of Liochev and Fridovich (17Liochev S.I. Fridovich I. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 1444-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Sankarapandi and Zweier (16Sankarapandi S. Zweier J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1226-1232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). All of the other self-inactivation experiments were carried out in the absence of phosphate at pH 8.0 and 37 °C to stabilize the concentration of bicarbonate and to mimic in vivo temperatures. Previous work (9Cabelli D.E. Allen D. Bielski B.H. Holcman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9967-9971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Borders Jr., C.L. Fridovich I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 241: 472-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) has demonstrated that SOD1 reacts almost exclusively with the peroxide anion and that the self-inactivation reaction has a large activation energy (data not shown). To account for both the increase in effective peroxide anion concentration at pH 8.0 and the increase in reaction rate because of the elevated temperature of 37 °C, a lower concentration of peroxide (relative to that in the self-inactivation at pH 7.2) was used. Conditions of the experiments performed to monitor the effect of bicarbonate anion in the presence of phosphate at 25 °C were as follows: 0.5 μm copper-bound CuZn-SOD, 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 10 μm EDTA, 20 mm H2O2, with and without 10 mm sodium bicarbonate. Conditions of the experiments performed to monitor the effect of bicarbonate in the absence of phosphate at 37 °C were as follows: 0.4 μm copper-bound CuZn-SOD, 0.5 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 μm EDTA, either 4 or 8 mm H2O2, with and without 25 mm sodium bicarbonate. 1-ml aliquots were withdrawn at timed intervals, and a drop of EtOH was added just before pulsing to yield an approximate concentration of 0.25 m EtOH in solution. The solutions were immediately pulse-irradiated, and their SOD activity was determined. SOD activity is known to be ionic strength-dependent, and the pK of ethanol is well above 9; therefore, variation in the final EtOH concentration would not alter the ionic strength of the solution. The indicated reaction temperatures were maintained in a thermostated water bath for the duration of the experiments. The pulse radiolysis cell was thermostated to the same temperature as the water bath. D125H SOD1 Purification, Crystallization, and Structure Determination—Recombinant human D125H CuZn-SOD was obtained as described previously through Saccharomyces cerevisiae expression under control of the ySOD1 promoter in the strain EG118 (sod1-), which lacks the gene encoding the yeast CuZn-SOD polypeptide (30Hayward L.J.

D125H SOD1 at 20 mg/ml in 2.25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 60 mm NaCl, crystallized as thick rectangular blocks in space group C2221 at 4 °C in 1–2 weeks with unit cell parameters a = 70.5 Å, b = 101.1 Å, c = 143.1 Å from hanging drops containing equal volumes (1–2 μl) of protein solution and reservoir solution (10 mm zinc sulfate, 25% v/v polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 550, 100 mm MES, pH 6.5). All of the crystals were quickly swept through a cryoprotecting solution containing 50% sorbitol in reservoir solution and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen prior to x-ray data collection. The wavelength for optimal copper and zinc anomalous signal was determined by scanning x-ray fluorescence of the crystals prior to x-ray data collection near regions corresponding to the absorption maximum of each metal. Copper exhibited no significant absorption, whereas zinc exhibited strong absorption at 1.2811 Å. X-ray diffraction data were obtained at the NSLS beamlines X12B (native data set) and X8C (zinc anomalous data set). For both data sets, the crystal-to-detector distance was 150 mm and the oscillation angle was 0.7°. Diffraction data were processed with the DENZO/SCALEPACK suite (HKL2000) (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 306-326Google Scholar). Single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing to 2.0 Å in CNS (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Density modification using solvent flipping improved the figure of merit to 0.8 and produced readily interpretable electron density maps. The molecular 2-fold axis of one D125H CuZn-SOD dimer is coincident with the crystallographic 2-fold axis parallel to b, and the asymmetric unit thus contains three D125H monomers. The crystals have a solvent content of 53% (Vm = 2.7). Model building and manual readjustments were performed in the program O (35Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Initial stages of refinement were accomplished in CNS, and in the final stages, SHELX-97 was used. Rfree was monitored in both refinement programs using identical test sets (34Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Upon implementing refinement of anisotropic thermal parameters in SHELX-97, both R and Rfree dropped (R from 19.6 to 14.6%, Rfree from 24.8 to 21.2%). Water molecules were introduced late in the refinement process where suitable 3σ difference electron density and reasonable hydrogen bond geometry were indicated. Modeling of Carbonate into the D125H SOD1 Structure—HCO3− was modeled into the SOD1 active site channel based on the position of the observed HSO4− in the D125H FALS mutant SOD1 structure. The carbonate molecule was downloaded from the Hetero-compound Information Center (HIC-Up, Uppsala, Sweden) (website: x-ray.bmc.uu.se/hicup/) (Release 6.1) (36Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). The anion was positioned in the molecular graphics program O, such that two of its oxygen atoms occupy the same positions as the OX1 and OX2 atoms of HSO4− in the D125H structure. The figures were created using MOLSCRIPT (37Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar), BOBSCRIPT (38Esnouf R.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec.

Pulse Radiolysis (Self-inactivation of SOD1)—The rate of self-inactivation of wild type CuZn-SOD in the presence (25 mm) and absence of bicarbonate anion in Tris buffer (0.5 mm, pH 8.0) is shown in Fig. 1A. Although bicarbonate anion is not necessary to detect the self-inactivation of SOD1 (upper line), if present, it increases the rate of self-inactivation by nearly 3-fold. As shown in Fig. 1B, when the self-inactivation of SOD1 is monitored in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, the addition of 10 mm bicarbonate has little effect. To determine the effect of bicarbonate anion on SOD1 mutant proteins found to cause familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, we compared the self-inactivation of wild type SOD1 and the FALS mutant L38V. L38V shows increased self-inactivation rates relative to those of wild type whether or not bicarbonate is present. Fig. 1C shows that the presence of HCO3− increases the rate of self-inactivation of both proteins to approximately the same extent, suggesting a common mechanistic pathway for this effect. Crystal Structure of D125H SOD1—The x-ray crystal structure of the human FALS mutant D125H was determined to 1.4 Å resolution using single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing methods (Table I). The as-isolated D125H SOD1 protein is nearly devoid of metal ions, binding only ∼0.1 and ∼0.4 equivalents of copper and zinc, respectively, per dimer (wild type = 2.0 equivalents) (30Hayward L.J. Rodriguez J.A. Kim J.W. Tiwari A. Goto J.J. Cabelli D.E. Valentine J.S. Brown Jr., R.H. J. Biol.

Zinc is found to occupy both metal binding sites, a fact confirmed through the analysis of fluorescence spectra that precede the x-ray data collection experiments and through single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing of experimental electron density maps using zinc as the anomalous scatterer. Fig. 2A shows the zinc-occupied copper binding site of a D125H monomer superimposed on 1.4 Å electron density contoured at 1.2 σ. The Zn(II) ion is coordinated by the three copper ligands, His-46, His-48, and His-120, all at distances of ∼2.0 Å. A sulfate anion (HSO4−) is observed in the active site channel with its OX1 atom acting as a fourth ligand to the zinc ion at a distance of ∼1.9 Å. The zinc coordination geometry is best described as pseudo-trigonal planar with the zinc ion displaced ∼0.4 Å from a plane formed by the nitrogen atoms of the three histidine ligands. In addition to its role as a metal ligand, the HSO4"

The breaking of the immune tolerance against the molecule associated with angiogenesis should be a useful approach for cancer therapy. However, the immunity to self-molecules is difficult to elicit by a vaccine based on autologous or syngeneic molecules due to immune tolerance. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a specific and potent angiogenic factor implicated in tumor growth. The biological activity of bFGF is mediated through interaction with its high-affinity receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1). In this study, we selected Xenopus FGFR-1 as a model antigen by the breaking of immune tolerance to explore the feasibility of cancer therapy in murine tumor models. We show here that vaccination with Xenopus FGFR-1 (pxFR1) is effective at antitumor immunity in three murine models. FGFR-1-specific autoantibodies in sera of pxFR1-immunized mice could be found in Western blotting analysis. The purified immunoglobulins were effective at the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and at the antitumor activity in vivo. The antitumor activity and production of FGFR-1-specific autoantibodies could be abrogated by depletion of CD4+ T lymphocytes. Histological examination revealed that the autoantibody was deposited on the endothelial cells within tumor tissues from pxFR1-immunized mice, and intratumoral angiogenesis was significantly suppressed. Furthermore, the inhibition of angiogenesis could also be found in alginate-encapsulate tumor cell assay. These observations may provide a new vaccine strategy for cancer therapy through the induction of autoimmunity against FGFR-1 associated with angiogenesis in a cross-reaction.

These findings suggest that FGFR1 plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis and tumor growth, and it may be used as an ideal molecule to explore the feasibility of tumor therapy. The current studies explore the feasibility of immunotherapy of tumors with the plasmid DNA encoding Xenopus FGFR-1 as a vaccine by the breaking of the immune tolerance against FGFR-1 in a cross-reaction between the xenogeneic homologous and self-FGFR-1. To test this concept, we constructed a plasmid DNA encoding Xenopus FGFR-1 (pxFR1). At the same time, the plasmid DNA encoding the corresponding mouse FGFR-1 (pmFR1) and empty vector (e-p) were also constructed and used as controls. The plasmid DNA vaccines were tested for the ability to induce antitumor immune response in three tumor models in mice. Vaccine Preparation—A cDNA clone encoding Xenopus homologous FGFR-1 and mouse FGFR-1 were isolated from by PCR using the Xenopus laevis cDNA library (Clontech) and the mouse skeletal muscle cDNA library (Clontech), respectively. The amplified products were inserted into pT-Adv plasmid (Clontech) and then subcloned into pcDNA 3.1(+) (Invitrogen), which contains a cytomegalovirus promoter. FGFR-1 receptors of Xenopus and mouse inserted into pcDNA 3.1(+) were named pxFR1 and pmFR1, respectively. As a control, pure pcDNA 3.1(+) was used as empty vector. The full-length sequence of Xenopus and mouse FGFR-1 was confirmed by dideoxy method sequence to be identical to those reported previously (22Musci T.J. Amaya E. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The expression of plasmid DNA was confirmed in transfected H22 hepatoma cells by using reverse transcription PCR and a commercially available anti-FGFR-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in Western blotting analysis and ELISA. Tumor Models and Immunization—Meth A fibrosarcoma, H22 hepatoma, and MA782/5S mammary carcinoma models were established in 6-week female BALB/c mice (30Wei Y.Q. Wang Q.R. Zhao X. Yang L. Tian L.

Mice were immunized with different doses (10–200 μg per mouse per injection) of DNA vaccine in normal saline by intramuscular injection in both quadriceps once a week for 4 weeks. Additional control animals were injected with normal saline. 1 × 105 to 1 × 10 7 live tumor cells were then inoculated subcutaneously into mice after the fourth immunization. For an investigation of the therapeutic effect against the established tumors, ten mice in each group were treated with intramuscular injection of the DNA vaccines or normal saline alone once weekly for 4 weeks starting on day 7 after subcutaneous introduction of 1 × 106 live tumor cells. Tumor dimensions were measured with calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated according to the formula width2 × length × 0.52 (31Sauter B.V. Martinet O. Zhang W. Mandeli J. Woo S.L.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4802-4807Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). All studies involving mice were approved by the institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Western Blot Analysis—H22 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells/well. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS followed by transfection with 2 μg of plasmid (pxFR1, pmFR1 or e-p) and 3 μg of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 h, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 20% fetal bovine serum was added to each well. The transfected cells were collected 48 h after the start of transfection. Western blot analysis was performed as described (30Wei Y.Q. Wang Q.R. Zhao X. Yang L. Tian L. Lu Y. Kang B. Lu C.J. Huang M.J. Lou Y.Y. Xiao F. He Q.M. Shu J.M. Xie X.J. Mao Y.Q. Lei S. Luo F.

Gels were electro-blotted with Sartoblot onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane blots were blocked by in 4 °C in 5% nonfat dry milk, washed, and probed with experimental mouse sera. Blots were then washed and incubated with a biotinylated secondary antibody (biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG or IgM), followed by transfer to Vectastain ABC (Vector Laboratories). Also, the lysates of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) expressing FGFR-1 were analyzed. Immunoglobulin Subclass Response to Xenopus FGFR-1 Immunization in ELISA—The antigen-specific immunoglobulin subclass in the sera was determined by ELISA as described previously (30Wei Y.Q. Wang Q.R.

Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Briefly, H22 cells transfected with pxFR1 and pmFR1 were washed with PBS and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Microtiter plates were coated with 50 μl of cell lysates (1 × 105 cell equivalents) at 4 °C overnight. The wells were then washed with PBS and blocked with blocking buffer at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing, experimental mouse sera were serially diluted in blocking buffer and added to the ELISA wells. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, washed, and then incubated with serially diluted alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody against mouse IgG subclass, IgM, or IgA (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Enzyme activity was measured with an ELISA reader (Bio-Rad). Inhibition of Cell Proliferation in Vitro and Adoptive Transfer in Vivo—Immunoglobulins were purified from the pooled sera derived from the mice at day 7 after the fourth immunization or from control mice by affinity chromatography (CM Affi-Gel blue gel kit; Bio-Rad). The inhibition of bFGF-mediated endothelial cell proliferation was described (28Auguste P. Gursel D.B. Lemiere S. Reimers D. Cuevas P. Carceller F. Di Santo J.P. Bikfalvi A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1717-1726PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, exponentially growing HUVEC and tumor cells (Meth A, H22, and MA782/5S) were treated with various concentrations (0–300 μg/ml) of immunoglobulins isolated from mice immunized with pxFR1, pmFR1, or e-p in the presence of 3 ng/ml bFGF (Sigma). After 72 h of culture, the number of viable cells was determined by a trypan blue dye exclusion test, and the percentage of inhibition was calculated (30Wei Y.Q. Wang Q.R. Zhao X. Yang L. Tian L. Lu Y. Kang B. Lu C.J. Huang M.J. Lou Y.Y. Xiao F. He Q.M. Shu J.M. Xie X.J. Mao Y.Q. Lei S. Luo F. Zhou L.Q. Liu C.E. Zhou H. Jiang Y. Peng F. Yuan L.P. Li Q. Wu Y. Liu J.Y. Nat Med. 2000; 6: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To assess the efficacy of immunoglobulins in antitumor activity in vivo, the purified immunoglobulins (10–300 mg/kg) were adoptively transferred intravenously 1 day before the mice were challenged with tumor cells, and then the mice were treated twice per week for 3 weeks. As a control, immunoglobulins were adsorbed four times by incubation at 4 °C for 1 h while rocking with endothelial cells expressing FGFR-1 (HUVEC) or with FGFR-1-negative cells (Meth A, H22, and MA782/5S). Depletion of Immune Cell Subsets in Vivo—Immune cell subsets were depleted as described (33Pulendran B. Smith J.L. Caspary G. Brasel K. Pettit D. Maraskovsky E. Maliszewski C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 500 μg of either the anti-CD4 (clone GK1.5, rat IgG), anti-CD8 (clone 2.43, rat IgG), anti-NK (clone PK136) mAb, or isotype controls 1 day before the immunization and then immunized with 100 μg of plasmid once per week for 3 weeks. Tumor cells were challenged after the fourth immunization. These hybridomas were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The depletion of CD4+, CD8+, and NK cells was consistently greater than 98% as determined by flow cytometry (Coulter Elite ESP) (30Wei Y.Q. Wang Q.R. Zhao X. Yang L. Tian L. Lu Y. Kang B. Lu C.J.

Nat Med. 2000; 6: 1160-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemistry—Frozen sections were fixed in acetone and incubated with a stained antibody reactive to CD31 as described (32Blezinger P. Wang J. Gondo M. Quezada A. Mehrens D. French M. Singhal A. Sullivan S. Rolland A. Ralston R. Min W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The sections were then stained with labeled streptavidin biotin reagents (Dako). Vessel density was determined counting the microvessels per high power field in the sections as described (32Blezinger P. Wang J. Gondo M. Quezada A. Mehrens D. French M. Singhal A. Sullivan S. Rolland A. Ralston R. Min W. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 343-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). To identify the possible deposition of autoantibodies, we stained the sections with goat FITC-conjugated antibody against mouse IgA, IgM, or IgG (Sigma). Slides were examined by fluorescence microscopy. Alginate-encapsulate Tumor Cells Assay—An alginate-encapsulate assay was performed as described (35Hoffmann J. Schirner M. Menrad A. Schneider M.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3847-3851PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were treated with 100 μg of pxFR1, pmFR1, e-p, or normal saline alone once a week for 4 weeks. Meth A cells, H22 hepatoma cells, or MA782/5S mammary cancer cells were resuspended in a 1.8% solution of alginate (Sigma) and added dropwise into a solution of 250 mm calcium chloride; alginate beads were formed containing ∼1 × 105 tumor cells per bead. Four beads were then implanted subcutaneously into an incision made on the dorsal side of the immunized mice. After 12 days, mice were injected intravenously with 0.1 ml of a 100 mg/kg FITC-dextran (Sigma) solution. Alginate beads were rapidly removed and photographed 20 min after FITC-dextran injection. The uptake of FITC-dextran was measured as described (35Hoffmann J. Schirner M. Menrad A. Schneider M.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3847-3851PubMed Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1965074914,"Pyridoxine (PN) is a metabolic precursor of pyridoxal phosphate that functions as a cofactor of many enzymes in amino acid metabolism. PN, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine are collectively referred to as vitamin B6, and mammalian organisms depend on its uptake from the diet. In addition to the ability to use extracellular vitamin B6, most unicellular organisms are also capable of synthesizing PN to generate pyridoxal phosphate. Here, we report the isolation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that have lost the ability to transport PN across the plasma membrane. We used these mutants to isolate TPN1, the first known gene encoding a transport protein for vitamin B6. Tpn1p is a member of the purine-cytosine permease family within the major facilitator superfamily. The protein functions as a proton symporter, localizes to the plasma membrane, and has high affinity for PN. TPN1 mutants lost the ability to utilize extracellular PN, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, showing that there is no other transporter for vitamin B6 encoded in the genome. Amino acid substitutions that led to a loss of Tpn1p function localized to transmembrane domain 4 within the 12-transmembrane domain protein. Moreover, expression of TPN1 was regulated and increased with decreasing concentrations of vitamin B6 in the medium. We also provide evidence that of the highly conserved SNZ and SNO genes in S. cerevisiae, only the protein encoded by SNZ1 is required for vitamin B6 biosynthesis.

We also provide evidence that of the highly conserved SNZ and SNO genes in S. cerevisiae, only the protein encoded by SNZ1 is required for vitamin B6 biosynthesis. Vitamins are essential dietary compounds for many organisms. Most water-soluble vitamins or derivatives thereof function as cofactors in enzymatic reactions. The group of vitamins that is referred to as vitamin B6 consists of pyridoxine (PN), 1The abbreviations used are: PN, pyridoxine; PL, pyridoxal; PM, pyridoxamine; PLP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate; ORF, open reading frame; GFP, green fluorescent protein; 3-AT, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. pyridoxal (PL), and pyridoxamine (PM). The active intracellular form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP), has multiple roles as a versatile cofactor of enzymes that almost exclusively function in the metabolism of amino compounds. PLP-dependent enzymes include α-, β-, and γ-synthetases, racemases, and decarboxylases of amino acids as well as aminotransferases (1John R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1248: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Unlike mammals, most unicellular organisms and plants are prototrophic for vitamin B6. The pathway that catalyzes PN biosynthesis is best characterized in Escherichia coli (2Dempsey W.B. Neidhart F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low B.L. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 539-543Google Scholar, 3Drewke C. Leistner E. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 121-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recently discovered pathway of vitamin B6 biosynthesis depends on the products of the SNZ (also referred to as PDX1) and SNO (also referred to as PDX2) genes (4Ehrenshaft M. Chung K.R. Jenns A.E.

Organisms encode either Snz/Sno-like proteins or proteins with homology to E. coli PdxA/PdxJ, but not both (5Ehrenshaft M. Bilski P. Li M.Y. Chignell C.F. Daub M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The proteins encoded by the SNZ and SNO genes are highly conserved and have members in all three domains of life (9Mittenhuber G. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2001; 3: 1-20PubMed Google Scholar). The Cercospora nicotianae SNZ homolog SOR1 is required for resistance to singlet oxygen-generating photosensitizers (10Ehrenshaft M. Jenns A.E. Chung K.R. Daub M.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 603-609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This finding was surprising and led to the discovery that PN, PL, PM, and PLP directly act as chemical quenchers of singlet oxygen and are as effective as well known antioxidants such as vitamins C and E (5Ehrenshaft M. Bilski P. Li M.Y. Chignell C.F. Daub M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9374-9378Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 11Bilski P. Li M.Y. Ehrenshaft M. Daub M.E. Chignell C.F. Photochem. Photobiol. 2000; 71: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Thus, the pyridoxine biosynthesis pathway serves a dual function to provide PLP as a cofactor and to provide protection against active oxygen species. Three homologs of SNZ genes and three homologs of SNO genes are present in the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The genes encoding these proteins are arranged into divergently oriented SNZ-SNO gene pairs that are regulated by a common promotor (12Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of SNZ1 is induced in stationary phase (13Braun E.L. Fuge E.K. Padilla P.A. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6865-6872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a feature later also found for SNO1 (12Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, deletion of SNZ1 causes PN dependence and deletion of SNO1 slows growth, whereas deletion of SNO2, SNO3, SNZ2, or SNZ3 does not lead to PN requirement (14Rodriguez-Navarro S. Llorente B. Rodriguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ramne A. Uber G. Marchesan D. Dujon B. Herrero E. Sunnerhagen P. Perez-Ortin J.E. Yeast. 2002; 19: 1261-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sno1p and Snz1p are present in a high molecular mass complex (12Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. Werner-Washburne M. J.

Nature. 2000; 403: 623-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). In vitamin B6 auxotrophic mutants, uptake of PN, PL, or PM from the extracellular space is required to generate intracellular PLP via a salvage pathway. The biochemistry of vitamin B6 uptake is best studied in Saccharomyces carlsbergensis (17Shane B. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1042-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an allopolyploid hybrid thought to have originated from fusion of S. cerevisiae with an unidentified yeast species (18Casaregola S. Nguyen H.V. Lapathitis G. Kotyk A. Gaillardin C. Int. J. Syst. Evol. Microbiol. 2001; 51: 1607-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on experiments with labeled substrates, Shane and Snell (17Shane B. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1042-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that S. carlsbergensis has two high affinity transport systems for vitamin B6. Consistent with an active transport mechanism for vitamin B6 uptake, S. carlsbergensis accumulates PN up to 3000-fold relative to outside concentrations, and transport is sensitive to metabolic inhibitors (17Shane B. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1042-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulation of PN is not a unique feature of S. carlsbergensis, but is commonly found in many yeast species, regardless whether they are prototrophic or auxotrophic for vitamin B6 (19Yagi T. Kim Y. Hiraoka Y. Tanouchi A. Yamamoto T. Yamamoto S. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 893-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Despite much evidence that vitamin B6 uptake across the plasma membrane is a protein-mediated process, not a single sequence of a PN transport protein is known to date. Here, we used S. cerevisiae mutants to identify Tpn1p, a protein from the purine-cytosine permease family that mediates the high affinity uptake of vitamin B6 across the plasma membrane. Yeast Strains and Media—The yeast media used were YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% dextrose) and SD (synthetic dextrose; 2% glucose and 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids). SD medium contains 2 μg/liter PN (1.93 μm). For media with varying concentrations of vitamin B6, yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and without vitamins (Bio 101, Inc.) was used. All vitamins were added to the standard concentrations present in yeast nitrogen base, and PN, PL, or PM was added to give the desired concentrations. Only supplements that were required by the strains were added. Growth assays were performed with yeast cell suspensions prepared in water in 96- well plates. Starting from the highest cell density (A600 = 0.6), serial 10-fold dilutions were made and transferred to plates with a replicating tool. The lager brewing yeast S. carlsbergensis 4228 was obtained from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen (Braun-schweig, Germany). FY1679-08a (MATaura3-52 leu2-Δ1 trp1-Δ63 his3- Δ200) and the isogenic ygl186cΔ strain (MATaura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1- Δ63 ygl186cΔ::kanMX4) were obtained from EUROSCARF (Frankfurt am Main, Germany). All other yeast strains used in this study were isogenic to W303-1A (MATaleu2-3,112 his3-11,15 trp1-1 ade2-1 ura3-1 can1-100) (20Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar). MW980 (MATasnz1-sno1Δ::URA3 snz2-sno2Δ::LEU2 snz3-sno3Δ::LEU2 trp1-1 ade2-1 his3-1 can1-100) (12Padilla P.A. Fuge E.K. Crawford M.E. Errett A. Werner-Washburne M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5718-5726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was mutagenized with ethyl methanesulfonate. Two mutants (MW980 tpn1-1 and tpn1-3) with slow growth on 0.02 μm PN were crossed with RKY02-1D (MATα ade2-1 ura3-1 trp1-1 leu2-3 his 3-11,15 can1-100 bna1Δ::HIS3) (21Kucharczyk R. Zagulski M. Rytka J. Herbert C.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 127-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A haploid strain derived from the cross of MW980 tpn1-3 that showed slow growth on medium containing 0.02 μm PN was then crossed with W303-1A snz1-sno1Δ::his5+ (MATaleu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 ura3-1 can1-100 snz1-sno1Δ::his5+). This cross was performed to substitute the snz1-sno1Δ::URA3 deletion for a snz1-sno1Δ::his5+ allele. From the progeny, JSX14-3a (MATaleu2-3,112 trp1-1 ade2-1 ura3-1 can1-100 snz1-sno1Δ::his5+tpn1-3) was used for complementation. The linked SNZ1-SNO1 genes were deleted in W303-1A with PCR products using the Schizosaccharomyces pombe his5+ gene as a marker. The ygl186cΔ::kanMX4 deletion was transferred from FY1679 into W303-1A and MW980 after PCR with primers flanking the integration site. All deletions were verified by PCR. Plasmid Constructs—An S. cerevisiae library in the multicopy vector YEp352 (22te Heesen S. Knauer R. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was used. It contains genomic DNA that was partially digested with Sau3AI and ligated into the BamHI site. Plasmids that complemented the growth defect of JSX14-3a were characterized by restriction digests to identify SNZ1-SNO1-containing plasmids. All other plasmids were sequenced. To generate a full-length allele of TPN1, the part of the gene that is missing in the library clone was amplified with Vent polymerase and ligated to the part of TPN1 that encodes the C terminus using the HindIII site within the open reading frame (ORF). Overexpression of TPN1 was achieved in pVT100-U, a URA3 multicopy vector with the yeast ADH1 promotor (23Vernet T. Dignard D. Thomas D.Y. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 52: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). All other constructs were made in the YCplac (single copy) and YEplac (multicopy) series of plasmids (24Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 74: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (2522) Google Scholar). A green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged version of TPN1 was generated in YEplac195, comprising the TPN1 promotor (429 bp upstream of the ATG start codon), followed by the GFP sequence, the TPN1 ORF, and 742 bp of TPN1 terminator sequence. The plasmid was transformed into W303-1A wild-type cells, and fluorescence was recorded with a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope. An identical construct in YCplac33 did not yield any fluorescence above background levels. To generate the SNZ1-containing plasmids, a library plasmid harboring the SNZ1-SNO1 gene pair was cut with SphI and BspEI to isolate SNZ1 along with 478 bp of promotor and 691 bp of terminator sequences. The SNZ1 gene was ligated into SphI-XmaI-cut YCplac33 or YEplac195. SNO1 was isolated as a ScaI-HindIII fragment containing 427 bp of promotor and 454 bp of terminator sequences. SNO1 was ligated into SmaI-HindIII-cut YCplac22 or YEplac112. All plasmids were transformed into W303-1A snz1-sno1Δ::his5+tpn1Δ::kanMX4. For the analysis of TPN1 alleles from S. cerevisiae and S. carlsbergensis, PCR with Vent polymerase was performed on genomic DNA as a template and primers that allowed amplification of the entire ORF. The products of two independent PCRs were ligated into pCR4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Uptake Experiments—Cells were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in SD medium, washed with water, and suspended in citric acid/phosphate buffers containing 1% d-glucose to energize the cells. 500 μl of cells (0.25 A600 units/ml for cells overexpressing TPN1 and 10 A units/ml for others) were incubated at 30 °C and stirred with a magnetic stirrer. The substrate, a mixture of tritiated PN (20 Ci/μmol; American Radiolabelled Chemical, Inc., St. Louis, MO) and unlabeled PN, was added to give a final concentration of 10 μm. Competitors or inhibitors were tested at pH 4.0 and added 60 s before starting the experiment. At given times, 60-μl aliquots were withdrawn, diluted with 5 ml of water, and filtered. After washing with excess water, the radioactivity associated with the filters was quantified by scintillation counting. RNA Analyses—MW980 cells were cultured overnight in media with 2, 0.2, and 0.02 μm PN and diluted into fresh media with the same concentrations of PN. Cells from the 0.02 μm PN culture were additionally used to inoculate media with 0, 2, and 0.2 nm PN. RNA was prepared from cells (40 A600 units), separated on formaldehyde gels, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were incubated with 32P-labeled probes corresponding to the entire ORF of TPN1. RNA prepared from strains carrying a tpn1Δ deletion showed no signals with the TPN1 probe (data not shown). Blots were exposed to phosphorimaging screens for quantification. Signals obtained with an actin (ACT1) probe were used for normalization. Generation of Mutants with Defects in PN Uptake—The yeast S. cerevisiae has two pathways for the synthesis of the essential cofactor PLP. One pathway requires the de novo synthesis of pyridoxine. The other pathway is the salvage pathway, which involves the transport of external sources of vitamin B6 across the plasma membrane. Because intracellular PN can derive from these two pathways, we reasoned that mutation of a putative PN transporter alone would not give rise to a phenotype. We therefore used strain MW980, which lacks all three SNZ-SNO gene pairs, for a mutational approach to identify the PN transporter. As expected, S. cerevisiae wild-type strains were capable of growing on a wide variety of PN concentrations and also grew in the absence of PN (Fig. 1A). MW980 grew like the wild-type strain when PN was present at concentrations of 0.02 μm or higher, but grew poorly at lower concentrations or when PN was absent (Fig. 1A). To identify mutants with defects in PN uptake, MW980 was treated with ethyl methanesulfonate and plated on YPD medium. Colonies were replicated on medium containing 2 or 0.02 μm PN. Two mutant strains carrying recessive and allelic mutations (tpn1-1 and tpn1-3) were isolated. Both mutants were growth-restricted on plates containing 20 nm PN or less, but grew like wild-type cells on plates with higher concentrations of PN (Fig. 1A). Compared with MW980, both mutants also had growth deficits on plates containing PL or PM (data not shown). Using [3H]PN as a substrate in a whole cell uptake experiment, we found that both mutants were defective in PN transport compared with W303-1A (wild-type) or MW980 (Fig. 1B). The amount of PN taken up by cells (1 A600 unit) in the 4-min experiment was 2.4 pmol for tpn1-1, 4.2 pmol for tpn1-3, 12.3 pmol for the wild-type strain, and 13.7 pmol for MW980. The higher activity of tpn1-3 relative to tpn1-1 is consistent with its slightly better growth (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the vitamin B6 auxotrophic mutant MW980 possessed higher activity for PN transport compared with wild-type cells. We conclude that both tpn1 mutants are defective in growth on low concentrations of vitamin B6 because of a defect in PN uptake. Complementation Cloning of YGL186C—To eliminate unwanted mutations, we next crossed both mutants with a wild-type strain and tested the progeny from this cross for the presence of the mutation. All strains that showed growth defects possessed the snz1-sno1Δ::URA3 deletion, ruling out a role of SNZ2-SNO2 and SNZ3-SNO3 in PN biosynthesis. Strain JSX14-3a, which carries the tpn1-3 mutation, resulted after a second cross that exchanged the snz1-sno1Δ::URA3 deletion for a snz1-sno1Δ::his5+ allele. JSX14-3a was transformed with a yeast genomic library generated in a multicopy vector and plated on medium containing 20 nm PN. Library transformants were tested on plates containing no vitamin B6 to identify clones that were able to synthesize PN. All of these transformants contained plasmids with the linked SNZ1-SNO1 genes. We did not isolate a single plasmid with the SNZ2-SNO2 or SNZ3-SNO3 gene pair from >20 PN prototrophic strains. Plasmids that did not confer vitamin B6 prototrophy were sequenced, and eight of them contained a gene coding for a protein with homology to plasma membrane transporters. The identified ORF, YGL186C, codes for a protein with homology to Fcy2p, the S. cerevisiae transporter for adenine, guanine, and cytosine (25Weber E. Rodriguez C. Chevallier M.R. Jund R. Mol. Microbiol. 1990; 4: 585-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 26Brethes D. Napias C. Torchut E. Chevallier J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, Ygl186cp, Fcy2p, and the Fcy21 and Fcy22 proteins that are similar to Fcy2p form the family of purine-cytosine permeases within the major facilitator superfamily (27Nelissen B. De Wachter R. Goffeau A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 21: 113-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ygl186cp is 29% identical to Fcy2p and 58% identical to Pcpl3p, a protein from Kluyveromyces marxianus whose function is unknown (28Ball M.M. Raynal A. Guerineau M. Iborra F. J. Mol. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 1: 347-353PubMed Google Scholar). An alignment of these three proteins is presented in Fig. 5. Interestingly, cytosine, one of the substrates of Fcy2p, and vitamin B6 compounds show similarities in their chemical structures (Fig. 2A).Fig. 2Structural similarity between vitamin B6 and cytosine and hydropathy analysis of Tpn1p.A, chemical structures of pyridoxal, pyridoxine, pyridoxamine, and cytosine. Note that the structures shown are those for the neutral compounds, whereas the forms of vitamin B6 are a mixture of ionic species whose charge depends on the pH of the medium. B, hydrophobicity analysis of the Tpn1p primary structure with TMpred (29Hofmann K. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar).

Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1993; 374: 166Google Scholar) showed that the 579-amino acid protein encoded by YGL186C is a membrane protein with 12 transmembrane domains (Fig. 2B), a feature typical of plasma membrane permeases for various substrates (30Henderson P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). However, the YGL186C ORF was contained only partially on all eight plasmids we isolated. The promotor and N terminus of the protein were missing due to the presence of a Sau3AI restriction site that had been cut during the generation of the library. The protein encoded by the truncated gene putatively starts at methionine 66 within the hydrophilic N-terminal part of the protein (Fig. 2B), thus leaving intact the 12 hydrophobic domains that presumably are essential for activity. Although tpn1-3 mutants carrying multicopy plasmids with the truncated gene did not display elevated levels of plasma membrane PN transport relative to controls (data not shown), the plasmids reproducibly complemented the growth phenotype of the mutants. It seemed possible that the truncated gene was expressed at levels that were undetectable by transport assays, but were sufficient to rescue the growth phenotype of tpn1-3 cells. Moreover, we were encouraged by the structural similarity of PN, PL, and PM to cytosine and the homology of Ygl186cp to Fcy2p and characterized YGL186C in more detail. YGL186C Encodes a Plasma Membrane Transport Protein for Pyridoxine—We performed uptake experiments with FY1679 wild-type cells and the isogenic ygl186cΔ deletion mutant to determine whether Ygl186cp functions in PN transport (Fig. 3A). Deletion of YGL186C caused a strong reduction in plasma membrane transport of PN, with the activity dropping from 27 pmol of PN taken up within 4 min in the wild-type cells to 3 pmol of PN in the ygl186cΔ mutant (Fig. 3A). This low level of PN uptake is comparable to the activity of the tpn1-1 and tpn1-3 mutants (Fig. 1B) and shows that YGL186C is involved in the plasma membrane transport of PN. In light of this observation and also data described below, we will refer to YGL186C as TPN1 (transport of pyridoxine-1). A full-length allele of TPN1 was generated and overexpressed using pVT100-U. Overexpression of TPN1 increased PN uptake activity to 700 pmol of PN/A600 units of cells within 5 min (Fig. 3B). This corresponds to a >20-fold increase in PN transport relative to wild-type cells. The increase in PN transport upon overexpression and the decrease in activity following deletion of TPN1, as well as the homology to Fcy2p, made it very likely that Tpn1p is a PN permease. This was further substantiated by the localization of the N-terminally GFP-tagged protein (Fig. 3C). Whereas W303-1A control cells produced only weak vacuolar fluorescence (presumably due to the accumulation of a red pigment in ade2 mutants), the GFP-TPN1-expressing cells showed fluorescence at the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C, right panel). Some intensely fluorescent spots were seen in cells that had high expression levels, and these might correspond to artifacts originating from overexpression. The uptake experiments and data on the localization of Tpn1p thus provide strong evidence that TPN1 encodes a plasma membrane-localized transporter for PN. Tpn1p Is a Proton-PN Symporter with a Broad Substrate Specificity—Cells overexpressing TPN1 from a multicopy plasmid were used for a detailed characterization of the PN transport activity. We found that PN transport was maximal when the uptake experiments were performed at pH 4.0, and 50% of this activity was detectable at pH 7.0. The activity decreased more rapidly toward acidic pH values, falling to 45% at pH 3.0. The Km value for PN uptake is 0.55 μm (data not shown), classifying Tpn1p as a high affinity transporter for PN. We next performed uptake experiments at pH 4.0 to determine whether other vitamin B6 compounds compete with PN uptake (Fig. 4A). We found that PM had only a weak effect when present at a 10-fold molar excess, but PN uptake was reduced to 50% at a 50-fold excess of PM. PL was more potent in competing PN uptake when present at a 10-fold excess. PN and 4-deoxypyridoxine both were equally effective competitors and reduced the PN uptake to 5% of control levels. It is possible that the weak competition of PM relative to PL, PN, and 4-deoxypyridoxine is caused by its amino group, which introduces an additional positive charge. PN uptake was also strongly reduced in the presence of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, and the remaining activity amounted to 9% of uninhibited cells. This indicates that, similar to the homologous Fcy2 protein (31Polak A. Grenson M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1973; 32: 276-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Reichert U. Winter M. Biochim.

Hopkins P. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), Tpn1p acts as a proton symporter. Thus, the PN transporter Tpn1p has a broad specificity for all three forms of vitamin B6. Tpn1p Is the Only Pyridoxine Transporter in S. cerevisiae— Experiments with S. carlsbergensis had provided evidence that two activities catalyze PN uptake (17Shane B. Snell E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 1042-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated whether the situation in S. cerevisiae is similar and analyzed the effect of deletion of TPN1 in a wild-type strain and in MW980 (Fig. 4B). A tpn1Δ strain grew like the wild-type strain under all conditions tested (Fig. 4B), although it possessed only residual levels of PN transport activity (Fig. 3A). This shows that wild-type cells derive most of their PN from biosynthesis. In contrast, growth was severely compromised when TPN1 was deleted in MW980. The concentrations that were necessary to support growth of MW980 tpn1Δ were 2 μm for PN and PL, whereas PM was at least 10-fold less potent. At high outside concentrations, sufficient amounts of PL and PN might enter the cells by passive diffusion, whereas PM might diffuse more slowly because it is positively charged. Because MW980 tpn1Δ failed to grow on low concentrations of PN, PL, or PM and because PM and PL acted as competitors of PN transport, we conclude that S. cerevisiae has only one transport protein for all three forms of vitamin B6 and that this protein is Tpn1p. Sequencing of tpn1-1 and tpn1-3 and the TPN1 Gene from S. carlsbergensis—A diploid strain constructed by mating tpn1-3 and tpn1Δ strains possessed growth and PN transport characteristics that were indistinguishable from those of the haploid tpn1-3 strain (data not shown). This indicated that the TPN1 gene was mutated in MW980 tpn1-3 and, by inference, also in MW980 tpn1-1. To identify these mutations, the gene was am"
https://openalex.org/W1989567728,"We previously developed peptides that bind to G protein βγ subunits and selectively block interactions between βγ subunits and a subset of effectors in vitro (Scott, J. K., Huang, S. F., Gangadhar, B. P., Samoriski, G. M., Clapp, P., Gross, R. A., Taussig, R., and Smrcka, A. V. (2001) EMBO J. 20, 767–776). Here, we created cell-permeating versions of some of these peptides by N-terminal modification with either myristate or the cell permeation sequence from human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein. The myristoylated βγ-binding peptide (mSIRK) applied to primary rat arterial smooth muscle cells caused rapid activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in the absence of an agonist. This activation did not occur if the peptide lacked a myristate at the N terminus, if the peptide had a single point mutation to eliminate βγ subunit binding, or if the cells stably expressed the C terminus of βARK1. A human immunodeficiency virus TAT-modified peptide (TAT-SIRK) and a myristoylated version of a second peptide (mSCAR) that binds to the same site on βγ subunits as mSIRK, also caused extracellular signal-regulated kinase activation. mSIRK also stimulated Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and phospholipase C activity and caused Ca2+ release from internal stores. When tested with purified G protein subunits in vitro, SIRK promoted α subunit dissociation from βγ subunits without stimulating nucleotide exchange. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which selective βγ-binding peptides can release G protein βγ subunits from heterotrimers to stimulate G protein pathways in cells. We previously developed peptides that bind to G protein βγ subunits and selectively block interactions between βγ subunits and a subset of effectors in vitro (Scott, J. K., Huang, S. F., Gangadhar, B. P., Samoriski, G. M., Clapp, P., Gross, R. A., Taussig, R., and Smrcka, A. V. (2001) EMBO J. 20, 767–776).

When tested with purified G protein subunits in vitro, SIRK promoted α subunit dissociation from βγ subunits without stimulating nucleotide exchange. These data suggest a novel mechanism by which selective βγ-binding peptides can release G protein βγ subunits from heterotrimers to stimulate G protein pathways in cells. G protein βγ subunits released from αβγ heterotrimers, in response to G protein-coupled receptor activation, regulate a variety of physiological processes including heart rate, neuronal excitability, and neutrophil chemotaxis. This regulation is mediated by interactions between βγ subunits and a variety of target molecules ranging from inwardly rectifying potassium channels to soluble enzymes such as phospholipase C (for review, see Ref. 1Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). βγ subunit-dependent regulation of the majority of its targets is inhibited by the α-GDP subunit. α-GDP is thought to sterically occlude a binding site on βγ subunits shared by all its effectors. Activation of βγ-dependent signaling occurs when α-GTP dissociates and uncovers this binding site (2Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a number of binding sites for effectors outside the βγ-α subunit interface have been identified by mutagenesis (3Panchenko M.P. Saxena K. Li Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P.M. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28298-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) or peptide cross-linking (4Yoshikawa D.M. Bresciano K. Hatwar M. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11246-11251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). A model emerging from this analysis predicts βγ subunit effectors may share a common interaction surface at the βγ-α subunit interface, but individual effectors also have unique interaction surfaces on βγ that could be targeted pharmacologically.To probe the nature of common and unique binding sites on βγ subunits, we screened random peptide libraries using purified G protein βγ subunits as the target to identify peptide sequences required for binding to various surfaces on βγ (5Scott J.K. Huang S.F. Gangadhar B.P. Samoriski G.M. Clapp P. Gross R.A. Taussig R. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Four divergent families of peptides were identified that all bound to a single site on the βγ subunit surface. We hypothesized this interaction surface represented a protein-protein interaction “hot spot” with the capacity to accommodate a diversity of amino acid sequences. Random peptide library screens often target such protein interaction surfaces (6Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 609-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 7Fairbrother W.J. Christinger H.W. Cochran A.G. Fuh G. Keenan C.J. Quan C. Shriver S.K. Tom J.Y. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17754-17764Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The peptides inhibited the interaction between βγ subunits and effector molecules such as phospholipase C (PLC) 1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; RASM, rat arterial smooth muscle; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; EGF, epidermal growth factor; βARK1ct, C terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; F-αi, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled myristoylated αi1; TAT-SIRK, human immunodeficiency virus TAT cell permeation sequence fused to SIRK.1The abbreviations used are: PLC, phospholipase C; RASM, rat arterial smooth muscle; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; EGF, epidermal growth factor; βARK1ct, C terminus of β-adrenergic receptor kinase; DTT, dithiothreitol; MAP, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; F-αi, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled myristoylated αi1; TAT-SIRK, human immunodeficiency virus TAT cell permeation sequence fused to SIRK. β and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase γ. Interestingly, these peptides did not affect regulation of other effectors such as adenylyl cyclase type I or voltage-gated calcium channels, demonstrating selective interference with particular G protein βγ subunit-target interactions. This indicates that the proposed hot spot is not a common binding surface for all βγ effectors.Most inhibitors of G protein βγ subunit-target interactions, such as the C-terminal domain of β-adrenergic receptor kinase (βARK1ct), are thought to be universal βγ subunit inhibitors, blocking activation of all downstream target molecules. Thus the βARK1ct has been used extensively in intact cells as a global inhibitor of βγ subunit signaling (8Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to introduce peptides derived from the phage display screen into intact cells to investigate the consequences of selectively interfering with particular G protein βγ subunit-target interactions in intact cells. To our surprise we found these peptides caused activation of G protein signaling in the absence of receptor activation. We provide evidence for a mechanism where these selective peptides bind to βγ subunits and promote dissociation of α subunits but leave a surface available on βγ subunits for activation of MAP kinase pathways.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Peptides were synthesized by Alpha Diagnostics International and purified by high performance liquid chromatography to greater than 90% purity, and the identity of the peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. The sequences of the peptides were as follows: mSIRK, myristate-SIRKALNILGYPDYD; mSIRK(L9A), myristate-SIRKALNIAGYPDYD; mSCAR, myristate-SCARFFGTPCP-amide; TAT-SIRK, fluorescein-GGGYGRKKRRQRRRG-SIRKALNILGYPDYD; TAT-SIRK(L9A), fluorescein-GGGYGRKKRRQRRRG-SIRKALNIAGYPDYD. mSCAR and mSIRK were dissolved in Me2SO; all other peptides were dissolved in water. Antibodies to phosphorylated ERK1/2, total ERK1/2, phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase, and phosphorylated p38 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. The specific EGF receptor kinase inhibitor AG1487 and src inhibitor PP2 were from Calbiochem. Thapsigargin, EGF, and lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) were from Sigma. Pertussis toxin was from List Biological Laboratories.Cell Culture—All cell culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. All cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Rat arterial smooth muscle (RASM) cells were used between passages 5 and 12. Stable cell lines expressing the βARK1ct were prepared and cultured as described previously (9Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Lyons P.R. Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).MAP Kinase Assays—RASM or other cells were plated into 35-mm dishes and grown to between 50 and 80% confluency. Serum was removed 16 h before treatment. Peptides in dimethyl sulfoxide or dimethyl sulfoxide vehicle were diluted 100–400-fold into the media and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated duration of time. After treatment, the cells were transferred to ice, and the media were quickly aspirated and replaced with 100 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. The resulting suspension was sonicated briefly in a bath sonicator, and 30 μl was loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After SDS-PAGE the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for 16 h at 25 V. The transferred proteins were immunoblotted using standard immunoblotting protocols with a 1:1,000 dilution of primary antibody (unless otherwise indicated) and a 1:10,000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The proteins were visualized by incubation with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposure to film. Visualization of the shift in molecular weight of ERKs in the total ERK Western blots was somewhat variable. The images for the total ERK Western blots in Fig. 1, A and B, were expanded to emphasize this difference. In other blots the purpose of the total ERK blots was to demonstrate equal sample loading in all lanes of the gels, and conditions were not optimized to resolve the masses of the phosphorylated ERK from ERK.Calcium Measurements—For Ca2+ imaging, RASM cells were grown on 25-mm glass coverslips and loaded with fura2-AM in Hanks' balanced saline solution plus 15 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. At the start of the experiment, the buffer was switched to Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced saline solution, and Ca2+ imaging was performed as described previously (10Romoser V.A. Graves T.K. Wu D. Jiang H. Hinkle P.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 125-135PubMed Google Scholar). Between 6 and 20 cells were followed in each experiment, and all experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. Traces show the responses of individual cells.Measurements of Inositol Phosphates—Cells were plated on 35-mm dishes and labeled by adding 3–5 μCi of [3H]inositol for 24–48 h in inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After labeling, the medium was removed and replaced with 1 ml of Hepes-buffered Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm LiCl and equilibrated for 20 min at 37 °C. Ligands or peptides were added in a volume of 50 μl for 30 min, after which the medium was aspirated and replaced with 1 ml of ice-cold perchloric acid. The acidified extracts were neutralized by extraction with 1 ml of 1:1 octylamine:Freon, and the aqueous phase was applied to Dowex AG1-X8 columns (Bio-Rad). The columns were washed with water and 50 mm ammonium formate followed by elution of the inositol phosphate-containing fraction with 1.2 m ammonium formate, 0.1 m formic acid. The eluted fraction was mixed with scintillation fluid and analyzed in a liquid scintillation counter.Preparation of Biotinylated βγ Subunits—The cDNA for rat β1 subunit was subcloned into a baculovirus transfer vector for expression of N-terminal fusions of a biotin acceptor peptide (11Duffy S. Tsao K.L. Waugh D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 262: 122-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The biotin acceptor peptide is a stretch of 20 amino acids that is the substrate for the enzyme biotin holoenzyme synthetase (BirA). When a protein fused to the biotin acceptor peptide is coexpressed with BirA the protein becomes biotinylated in vivo at a specific lysine residue in the acceptor peptide sequence. The rat β1 subunit was subcloned by PCR with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) using primers 5′-ATAAGGCGCGCCAAGTGAACTTGACCAGCTGC-3′ and 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGATCCACCTGCTACTG-3′ and cloned into the baculovirus transfer vector PDW464 in-frame with the biotin acceptor sequence between the AscI and EcoRI restriction sites to yield MAGGLNDIFEAQKIEWHEDTGGA... β1 sequence, with the lysine residue the site of biotinylation. Baculovirus was generated via recombination in bacteria as described in the Bac-to-Bac system manual (Invitrogen). Biotin-β1γ2 was purified from Sf9 cells using hexahistidine-tagged αi1 following previously published procedures (12Kozasa T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1734-1741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Biotinylation of the purified β subunit was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with streptavidin-linked horseradish peroxidase and detection with chemiluminescence. To confirm that the β subunit was fully biotinylated, it was precipitated with streptavidin-agarose, and greater that 90% of the β subunit was removed from the supernatant by this procedure.Measurement of GTP Hydrolysis and GTPγS Binding—Steady state GTP hydrolysis was assayed as [32P]Pi release from [γ-32P]GTP by standard procedures (13Higashijima T. Burnier J. Ross E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14176-14186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTPγS binding was measured according to (14Hartman IV, J.L. Northup J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 271: 22591-22597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar), except Sf9 cell membranes expressing the M2 muscarinic acetyl choline receptor were reconstituted with purified recombinant myristoylated αi and β1γ2.Measurement of α-βγ Interactions by Flow Cytometry—Binding of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled myristoylated αi1 (F-αi) to biotinylated β1γ2 subunits was measured using a flow cytometry assay (15Sarvazyan N.A. Remmers A.E. Neubig R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7934-7940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16Sarvazyan N.A. Lindau M. Neubig R.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12858-12867Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Biotinylated βγ subunits (250 pm final concentration) were mixed with streptavidin beads in HEDNMLG (20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm free Mg2+, 0.1% polyoxyethylene 10 lauryl ether, 10 μm GDP). After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the beads were washed twice by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge with HEDNMLG and resuspended in the same buffer at a concentration of 105 beads/ml (250 pm βγ). For α subunit dissociation experiments, the beads with bound βγ subunits were premixed with 1 nm F-αi for 10 min before the addition of competitors. For equilibrium binding measurements, 1 nm F-αi and competitors were added simultaneously. The amount of F-αi bound to beads with biotinylated βγ was assayed at the times indicated in the figure legends using a BD Biosciences FACscan flow cytometer. Nonspecific binding, determined by the simultaneous addition of 1 nm F-αi and 50 nm myristoylated αi, was 10–20% of the total signal and was subtracted from the data.RESULTSTo investigate the consequence of selectively inhibiting βγ subunit functions in intact cells, we created cell-permeating peptides by synthesizing one of our phage display selected peptides, SIRKALNILGYPDYD (SIRK) with myristate (17Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B. de Widt J. Liskamp R.M. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1982-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) at the N terminus (mSIRK). We tested the ability of this peptide to affect activation of ERK1 and ERK2 in primary cultures of RASM cells. In these cells it has been shown that ERK1 and ERK2 can be activated by stimulation of G protein-coupled LPA receptors. This activation is blocked by pertussis toxin and by an adenovirus expressing the βARK1ct, implicating Gi and βγ subunits in the activation process (18Iaccarino G. Smithwick L.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Koch W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3945-3950Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we predicted that our cell-permeating peptides might block LPA-induced ERK activation. Surprisingly, application of mSIRK to RASM cells in the absence of added LPA caused a rapid and dose-dependent activation of ERK1/2 as detected by Western blotting for the phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (Fig. 1, A and B). The concentration of mSIRK required for half-maximal activation of ERK1/2 was 2.5–5 μm, equivalent to the estimated Kd of this peptide for G protein βγ subunits (5Scott J.K. Huang S.F. Gangadhar B.P. Samoriski G.M. Clapp P. Gross R.A. Taussig R. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Full activation was achieved after 1 min of application and diminished over the course of 30 min. Activation of ERK1/2 is also indicated by the upward shift in molecular weight of ERK1/2 in a Western blot for total ERK1/2. For Fig. 1, A and B, the conditions were optimized to resolve the phosphorylated from the non-phosphorylated ERK1/2 in a total ERK1/2 Western blot (see the asterisks in the bottom panels, Fig. 1, A and B). At full activation, all of the ERK1/2 was shifted to a higher molecular weight phosphorylated form, indicating all of the ERK in all of the cells was activated by this peptide.To analyze the specificity of this effect we created a second myristoylated version of this peptide where leucine 9 was changed to alanine (mSIRK(L9A)). We had previously performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis of SIRK and found substitution of Ala for Leu-9 increased the IC50 of this peptide for blocking βγ-dependent PLC activation by more than 100-fold (from 3 to 300 μm) (5Scott J.K. Huang S.F. Gangadhar B.P. Samoriski G.M. Clapp P. Gross R.A. Taussig R. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 1C demonstrate mSIRK(L9A) was completely unable to enhance ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Additionally, a myristoylated-scrambled version (not shown) and a non-myristoylated version of the peptide (SIRK) (Fig. 1C) were unable to cause ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The necessity for myristoylation of the peptide for cellular activity supports the idea that entry of the peptide into the cell is needed to cause ERK activation. To further support the need for intracellular action, we constructed a peptide where the 11-amino acid cell permeation sequence from human immunodeficiency virus TAT protein (19Schwarze S.R. Ho A. Vocera-Akbani A. Dowdy S.F. Science. 1999; 285: 1569-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2178) Google Scholar) was added to the N-terminal end of SIRK (TAT-SIRK). Fluorescein was attached to the N terminus to monitor cellular uptake. TAT-SIRK was efficiently taken up into virtually all of cells on the dish as monitored by fluorescence microscopy (not shown). TAT-SIRK was able to activate ERK1/2 to an extent comparable with mSIRK (Fig. 1D), whereas TAT-SIRK(L9A) had no effect (data not shown). These cell-permeating peptides activated ERK to a greater extent than LPA and to an extent comparable with EGF in this assay paradigm (Fig. 1D). Together, these data indicate that structural requirements in the peptides for βγ binding need to be maintained to observe ERK1/2 activation and that the peptides need to get inside the cell and are not acting by binding to cell surface receptors. This, in conjunction with the observation that the concentration requirement for ERK1/2 activation correlates with the apparent Kd of SIRK for βγ subunits in vitro (5Scott J.K. Huang S.F. Gangadhar B.P. Samoriski G.M. Clapp P. Gross R.A. Taussig R. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), strongly supports the idea that βγ is the target of the peptides and this targeting is responsible for ERK1/2 activation.Gβγ Is the Target of the Peptides in the Intact Cell—To further support the idea that βγ subunits are the target of the peptides in intact cells, we tested a peptide with a completely different amino acid sequence from SIRK. The peptide, SCARFFGTPCP (SCAR), was also selected in the phage display screen, and we have shown by competition analysis that SCAR peptide binds to βγ subunits in vitro at the same site as SIRK (5Scott J.K. Huang S.F. Gangadhar B.P. Samoriski G.M. Clapp P. Gross R.A. Taussig R. Smrcka A.V. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 767-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We predicted a myristoylated version of SCAR (mSCAR) should have the same effect as mSIRK on ERK1/2 activation in RASM cells. We have also shown that for SCAR to bind to βγ subunits, the cysteine residues must form an intramolecular disulfide bond. If SCAR is reduced with DTT, it is no longer able to bind to βγ in a phage enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assay. The results in Fig. 2A show mSCAR activates ERK1/2, pretreatment with DTT eliminates its ability to activate ERK1/2, whereas DTT has no effect on the ability of the linear mSIRK to stimulate ERK1/2. These data emphasize that the structure of the peptide binding to βγ subunits is important to observe activation of ERK1/2, not just the peptide sequence.Fig. 2Activation of ERK1/2 by mSIRK involves a Gβγ-dependent signaling pathway.A, other peptides that bind to βγ also activate ERK1/2. RASM cells were treated with 5 μm mSIRK for 5 min or 5 μm mSCAR for 15 min. For the DTT treatment, the peptides in media at 5 μm were treated with 10 mm DTT for 30 min before the addition to the cells. B, the βARK1ct inhibits mSIRK-mediated activation of ERK1/2. Stable cell lines expressing the βARK1ct or vector control cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of mSIRK, 10 μm LPA, or Me2SO (DMSO) control for 5 min and processed as described. This experiment was repeated three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To provide further evidence Gβγ subunits are the target of mSIRK and related peptides, we tested the ability of mSIRK to cause ERK1/2 activation in a RASM cell line stably transfected with the C-terminal region of βARK that sequesters βγ subunits (βARK1ct (Gly-495–Leu-689)) (8Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Inglese J. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6193-6197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ushio-Fukai M. Alexander R.W. Akers M. Lyons P.R. Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that mSIRK binds to βγ but leaves a surface available on βγ to signal to some downstream targets. Based on this hypothesis, we predicted that ERK1/2 activation by mSIRK would be inhibited by the βARK1ct, a general βγ inhibitor that blocks signaling of βγ to most if not all effectors. The data in Fig. 2B demonstrate that in cells expressing βARK1ct, activation of ERK1/2 was almost completely inhibited compared with the control RASM cells. This indicates that βγ subunit signaling is the target of these peptides.Cell Type Specificity of ERK Activation by mSIRK—All of the experiments described so far used rat arterial smooth muscle cells. To examine the generality of this response, mSIRK was tested in a variety of cell lines. The results in Fig. 3A show that the effect of mSIRK is dependent on the cell type. RASM and Rat2 cells show dramatic activation of ERK1/2 by mSIRK, whereas other smooth muscle cells such as ddtMF2 cells show very little, but some response. These differences could be due to a variety of factors. One possibility is that the myristoylated peptide is only able to enter certain cell types. We, therefore, tested the effects of TAT-SIRK on HEK293 and Cos7 cells. Similar to mSIRK, TAT-SIRK had only small effects on activation of ERK1/2 (not shown). We were able to monitor the uptake of TAT-SIRK into these cells with a fluorescein label and confirmed that this peptide did indeed enter the cells. This indicates that the cell type-specific responses are not due to differential uptake of the peptides, and differences in the endogenous MAP kinase signaling systems may be responsible, i.e. in some cell types βγ-dependent MAP kinase activation is stronger than others.Fig. 3Cell type specificity and pathway for ERK1/2 activation.A, the magnitude of activation of ERK1/2 is dependent upon the cell type. The indicated cell types were treated with Me2SO or 10 μm mSIRK for 5 min. All samples were processed and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1. B, the pathway activated by peptide treatment involves src but not transactivation of the EGF receptor. Cells were treated with 1 μm AG1478 for1hor10 μm PP2 for 30 min before the addition of 5 μm mSIRK or 10 nm EGF for 5 min. Each of the treatments was repeated in at least three separate experiments. C, calcium release from intracellular pools was not responsible for ERK1/2 activation, and the activation is not blocked by pertussis toxin (PTX). Cells were treated with 1 μm thapsigargin (30 min) to empty intracellular calcium pools before the addition of 10 μm mSIRK. For pertussis toxin treatments, cells were treated for 16 h with 100 ng/ml pertussis toxin followed by treatment with either 5 μm mSIRK (5 min) or 10 μm LPA (5 min). Measurement of ERK1/2 is as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Activation of ERK1/2 Requires src but Not EGF Receptor Transactivation or Calcium Release from Internal Stores—We used a variety of pharmacological inhibitors to examine the pathway involved in the response to mSIRK. As expected, a MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) inhibitor, PD98059, was able to completely block the effect of the peptide (not shown). PP2, a specific src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was able to completely block mSIRK-mediated activation of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3B). Src is thought to be involved in βγ-mediated activation of ERK1/2 by G protein-coupled receptors, consistent with a pathway involving βγ subunits (20Luttrell L.M. Della R.G. van Biesen T. Luttrell D.K. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4637-4644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The involvement of EGF receptor transactivation was tested using a specific inhibitor of the EGF receptor, AG1478. This inhibitor completely blocked the ability of the EGF receptor to activate ERK1/2 but had no effect on ERK1/2 activation by mSIRK (Fig. 3B). Thapsigargin treatment, which almost completely emptied the intracellular calcium stores (data not shown and Fig. 4B), was unable to block the effect of mSIRK, indicating that release of calcium from intracellular stores is not responsible for ERK1/2 activation (Fig. 3C). Finally, treatment with pertussis toxin did not block the effect of mSIRK (Fig. 3C), supporting the idea that receptor activation is not involved in the peptide dependent activation of ERK signaling.Fig. 4Multiple signaling pathways are activated by mSIRK treatment.A, p38 MAP kinase and Jun N-terminal kinase are activated by mSIRK. RASM cells were treated with 5 μm mSIRK, mSIRK(L9A), or 1% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 5 min, and samples were assessed for p38 MAP kinase activation, Jun N-terminal kinase activation, and ERK activation by Western blotting with antibodies specific for phosphorylated (P) p38, phosphorylated Jun N-terminal kinase, and phosphorylated ERK, respectively. Total ERK1/2 is shown as a loading control. DMSO, Me2SO. B, mSIRK causes mobilization of intracellular Ca2+.

To estimate the intracellular Ca2+pool, 1 μm ionomycin (Iono) was added at the end of the experiment. In the bottom panel, cells were exposed to 100 nm thapsigargin during loading and i"

The SlyA family, which includes SlyA, Rap, Hor, and RovA proteins, is widely distributed in bacterial and archaeal genomes. Current evidence suggests that SlyA-like factors act as repressors, activators, and modulators of gene transcription. These proteins have been shown to up-regulate the expression of molecular chaperones, acid-resistance proteins, and cytolysin, and down-regulate several biosynthetic enzymes. The structure of SlyA from Enterococcus faecalis, determined as a part of an ongoing structural genomics initiative (www.mcsg.anl.gov), revealed the same winged helix DNA-binding motif that was recently found in the MarR repressor from Escherichia coli and the MexR repressor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a sequence homologue of MarR.

Phylogenetic analysis of the MarR/SlyA family suggests that Sly is placed between the SlyA and MarR subfamilies and shows significant sequence similarity to members of both subfamilies. Comparisons of amino acid sequences and sequence patterns in prokaryotic genomes have identified many putative DNA-binding proteins and transcription factors. A sequence pattern common to several families of Escherichia coli regulatory proteins (GalR/LacI, DeoR, IclR, GntR, Crp, MarR, MerR, and AsnC) has been identified (1Perez-Rueda E. Collado-Vides J. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 53: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the structures of several transcriptional regulators have been determined (2Huffman J.L. Brennan R.G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins contain the classic helix-turn-helix (HTH) DNA-binding motif and exhibit an associated sequence pattern. A large number of the putative transcription factors, however, reveal new DNA-binding motifs (2Huffman J.L. Brennan R.G. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The MarR/SlyA family is one example. Members of this large family modulate gene expression and are widely distributed. The COG data base includes 149 members of the MarR (multi-antibiotic resistance) family, among them 23 MarR homologues from Bacillus subtilis, MprA from E. coli, PecS from Erwinia chrysanthemi, and Hpr from B. subtilis (4Dehoux P.

This structural motif was recently found in the MexR repressor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a sequence homologue of MarR (7Lim D. Poole K. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29253-29259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). SlyA-like proteins were found in 118 species of bacteria and 15 species of archaea, with 16 SlyA homologues in E. coli alone (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/cgi-bin/Entrez/blink). This family includes such proteins as SlyA of Salmonella typhimurium and E. coli, and the Rap, Hor, and RovA proteins from Serratia marcescens, Erwinia carotovora, and Yersinia entero-colitica, respectively (8Revell P.A. Miller V.L. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2001; 205: 159-164Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In E. coli, SlyA regulates expression of cytolysin A, a cytotoxic protein that forms, stable, cation-selective transmembrane pores (9Ludwig A. Bauer S. Benz R. Bergmann B. Goebel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Oscarsson J. Westermark M. Lofdahl S. Olsen B. Palmgren H. Mizunoe Y. Wai S.N. Uhlin B.E. Infect. Immunol. 2002; 70: 5759-5769Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The slyA gene is implicated in virulence and environmental adaptation of S. typhimurium. It has been shown to up-regulate the expression of molecular chaperones, acid-resistance proteins, and cytolysin and down-regulate several biosynthetic enzymes (11Spory A. Bosserhoff A. von Rhein C. Goebel W. Ludwig A. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3549-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that regulation of gene expression by SlyA is crucial for intracellular survival and/or replication of both enteroinvasive E. coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in phagocytic host cells. RovA, whose amino acid sequence is 77% identical to that of the S. typhimurium SlyA, plays a role in regulation of the invasion of mammalian cells by Yersinia and mediates regulation of invasin in response to environmental signals (12Nagel G. Lahrz A. Dersch P. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 41: 1249-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Invasin is a primary factor that allows efficient internalization of Yersinia pseudotuberculosis into eukaryotic cells. All the current evidence shows that SlyA-like factors act as repressors, activators, or modulators of gene transcription. The SlyA protein from a pathogen, Enterococcus faecalis (SlyA-Ef), was selected for this study as part of an ongoing structural genomics initiative (www.mcsg.anl.gov). The specific biochemical function, the signal molecule, and the DNA-binding properties of this protein are unknown. Phylogenetic analysis of the MarR/SlyA family suggests that SlyA-Ef is placed between the SlyA and MarR subfamilies. It shows significant sequence similarity to members of both subfamilies (Fig. 1). In this report we present the crystal structure of a SlyA transcriptional regulator at 1.6 Å resolution and discuss structural relationships between members of the MarR/SlyA family. The E. faecalis SlyA open reading frame was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, with the NdeI and BamHI sites engineered at the translation start codon and immediately downstream of the translation stop codon, respectively, and cloned between the NdeI and BamHI sites of the pET15b vector (Novagen) in-frame with the His-tag and the rTEV cleavage site. Expression of the His-tagged fusion protein in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) carrying the pMAGIC vector was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Cells were harvested after 4 h of culture at 37 °C; suspended in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol; and lysed by sonication. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic Superflow resin (Qiagen). The His-tag was removed by digestion with rTEV, and the resulting protein was purified by affinity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic Superflow resin (Qiagen). In this design, three amino acid residues were added at the N terminus of SlyA. The cleaved protein was further purified on an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (Amersham Biosciences) using 0.5 and 1.0 m NaCl two-step elution and concentrated with simultaneous buffer exchange using Centriplus-3 (Amicon) (3-kDa cutoff). A 2 mm protein stock solution in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol was used for crystallization. Selenomethionine-labeled SlyA protein was prepared using the methionine biosynthesis inhibition method (13Walsh M.A. Dementieva I. Evans G. Sanishvili R. Joachimiak A. Acta Cryst. D Biol. Cryst. 1999; 55: 1168-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Equal volumes of SlyA protein stock solution and buffers were mixed in hanging droplets and equilibrated against 1-ml aliquots of solutions from the Hampton Research sparse matrix crystallization screening kit. SlyA was crystallized from 30% polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350, 20% glycerol and 100 mm Hepes-sodium (pH 7.6) at 283 K. Crystals (0.2 × 0.02 × 0.4 mm) were rinsed in cryoprotectant solution consisting of 25% glycerol in the crystallization solution and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at the 19BM beamline of the Structural Biology Center at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Crystals of native SlyA protein and its selenomethionine derivative diffracted to 1.8 and 2.0 Å, respectively. The space group was P212121 with cell dimensions of a = 43.512, b = 48.429, and c = 95.911. MAD data were collected to 2.0 Å of resolution from a single crystal containing selenomethionine-labeled protein at three different x-ray wavelengths near the selenium edge. Inverse beam strategy was used. The absorption edge was determined by a fluorescent scan of the crystal as described previously (13Walsh M.A. Dementieva I. Evans G. Sanishvili R. Joachimiak A.

The final R-factor and R-free are 24.8% and 27.5%, respectively, with excellent stereochemistry (Table II). The final structure included 145 amino acid residues and 179 water molecules. The PROCHECK analysis showed that all residues are in the allowed region of the Ramachandran plot (18Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The electron density for the main chain is high quality, except for the N-terminal Met and the five C-terminal residues.Table IICrystallographic statisticsResolution range (Å)PhasingCentricAcentricAllFOMaFOM, figure of meritPhasing powerFOMaFOM, figure of meritPhasing powerNo.FOMaFOM, figure of meritPhasing power30.0-1.80.83082.57200.64522.4129429690.65712.4245Density modification0.80826RefinementResolution range (Å)30-1.6No. of reflections32997σ cutoff0.0R-value (%)24.8Free R-value (%)27.5 (2819)Root mean square deviations from ideal geometryBond length (1-2) (Å)0.009Angle (°)1.00Dihedral (°)17.3Improper (°)0.67No. of atomsProtein2331Water289Mean B-factor (Å2) for all atoms21.0Ramachandran plot statistics (%)Residues in most favored regions99.2Residues in additional allowed regions0.8Residues in disallowed region0.0a FOM, figure of merit Open table in a new tab Structure of SlyA—The crystal of unliganded SlyA-Ef contains two monomers in an asymmetric unit related by a pseudo-2-fold dyad. The 2-fold symmetry of the DNA-binding domains in the crystal structure (Fig. 2) is consistent with the palindromic character of the DNA sequences recognized by members of the SlyA family (9Ludwig A. Bauer S. Benz R. Bergmann B. Goebel W. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The SlyA dimer appears to have a “Swiss cheese”-like structure with numerous channels, cavities, and voids. We suggest that these features are used for interaction with as yet unknown signal molecules and other cofactors working together in transcription regulation (Fig. 2b). The protein dimer consists of three function-related structural elements, i.e. a dimerization unit composed of two domains and two independent DNA-binding domains. The dimerization domain includes an N-terminal α-helix, H1, and two C-terminal α-helices, H6 and H7 (Fig. 3). The structure of the dimerization unit reveals domain swapping. Helix H1 (subunit A) is inserted between H6′ and H7′ (subunit B) and forms a coil-coil with H7′. This interaction is mediated by a number of hydrophobic interactions and a salt bridge between conserved Glu-120 and conserved Arg-130′ from the opposite subunits. Arg-130′ also forms a hydrogen bond to Asp-126′. The C terminus of H6 also contributes to the dimer interface. The interaction between subunits is very extensive, with a total surface of 5025 Å2 buried between subunits, a very large area for such a small 150-residue protein. The DNA-binding domain is formed by the central part of the polypeptide and includes α-helices H2, H3, H4, and H5, and a β-hairpin (residues 73–91). There is virtually no interaction between DNA-binding domains in the SlyA dimer. This domain contains a DNA-binding motif described previously as a winged helix. In SlyA-Ef, it is composed of H5 and the 19-residue β-hairpin as a wing. This architecture closely resembles the WH motif of the well established major groove DNA-binding domain found in a number of transcriptional regulators (6Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 19Gajiwala K.S. Burley S.K. Curr. Opin. Struct.

The WH motif in SlyA-Ef is preceded by two short α-helices, H3 and H4, with a short β-strand and a small loop between them. The motif is followed by H6, which is a part of the dimerization domain. Two residues conserved in the SlyA family, Thr-91 and Gly-94, are located at the junction between the wing and H6 (Fig. 1). These residues are also conserved in the MarR family and may be important for the positioning of the DNA-binding domain on its DNA target. Interactions within the DNA-binding domain are mostly hydrophobic and involve several conserved residues (Figs. 1 and 2). Interactions between the DNA-binding and dimerization domains include the following four regions of the protein: 1) the C terminus of H7 (Trp-139 and Lys-143); 2) the C terminus of H1, short helix H2 (Phe-25), and a loop between H2 and H3; 3) the N terminus of H6 (Tyr-98); and 4) the N terminus of H1 of the opposite subunit, including a salt bridge between Glu-41 and Arg-6′ (these two residues are not strictly conserved in the SlyA family). It has been suggested that conserved glycine residues between secondary structure elements in the WH motif serve as flexible hinges to accommodate DNA targets with different half-site spacings (20Zhang R.G. Kim Y. Skarina T. Beasley S. Laskowski R. Arrowsmith C. Edwards A. Joachimiak A. Savchenko A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19183-19190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In SlyA-Ef, glycines 31, 44, 72, and 94 may perform this function. SlyA Family Shows Strong Structural Homology to MarR— The SlyA-Ef has a number of structural homologues identified in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) both by the program available at the DALI server and by the Secondary Structure Matching Program at EMBL-EBI. The closest match identified by the program is the structure of MexR from P. aeruginosa (PDB code 1LNW). 88% of the secondary structure elements match, and the sequences are 17% identical. The root mean square deviation between structurally equivalent Cα positions of the monomer is 2.07 Å. The next most significant matches (at 75% of the secondary structure elements matched) are to MarR from E. coli (1JGS) and MotA from bacteriophage T4 (1BJA), with sequence identities of 16 and 12% and root mean square deviations of 2.79 and 3.67 Å, respectively. The Swiss cheese characteristic of the SlyA dimer is also apparent in MarR and MexR proteins, although the precise nature of the accessible regions differs among them. This difference may reflect specificity for different signaling molecules or different modes of action. Interaction with DNA—Crystal structures of the three MarR homologues as well as SlyA were determined without their DNA target or signal molecules bound. The structure of MarR protein includes salicylate, a known inhibitor of DNA binding (6Alekshun M.N. Levy S.B. Mealy T.R. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The structures of MexR and SlyA-Ef discussed here are of unliganded proteins, posing an important question of how these proteins interact with their specific DNA targets and whether these structures can provide new insight into DNA recognition. The MexR structure shows three different dimers with varied spacing between their WH motifs and high degrees of conformational flexibility (7Lim D. Poole K. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29253-29259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The largest space between Cα positions of Arg-73/Arg-73′ was 29.9 Å. In the SlyA-Ef structure, the equivalent spacing (Arg-67/Arg-67′) is shorter (24.63 Å). Analysis of the MarR structure using a program available at the PITA server to generate biological dimers 2H. Ponstingl, manuscript in preparation. indicates that the spacing between the Cα positions of Arg-77/Arg-77′ is 28.1 Å. These key arginine residues exhibit different arrangements in the three structures. In MexR, they are positioned on the DNA binding surface and are expected to point toward the bases in the DNA major groove. In MarR and SlyA, the arginine side chains are also at the DNA binding surface but are expected to point away from the bases and the major groove. These differences suggest that the mode of binding of these proteins to DNA is not identical. Moreover, these data suggest that MarR/SlyA proteins may span a narrow minor groove and may recognize a rather short palindromic DNA sequence (14–16 bp). The high-degree of flexibility of DNA-binding domains displayed in different crystals provides indirect evidence of the ability of this fold to adapt in order to recognize various DNA targets. Analysis of the crystal structure of the complex bound to DNA will test this hypothesis. It is also evident that the C terminus of SlyA is in position to facilitate an interaction with DNA. The C terminus of SlyA and its homologues contains several conserved positively charged residues that could make contacts with phosphate groups or bases. In the SlyA-Ef dimer, the WH motifs are positioned to interact with a palindromic recognition sequence, with specific contacts expected to occur predominantly between H5 and the wing and the major groove of DNA. The WH motif in SlyA-Ef is strongly positively charged due to the presence of five arginines and four lysines; however, these residues are not conserved between SlyA and MarR families, suggesting that different DNA targets or different sets of residues in the same DNA target are recognized. A cavity between DNA-binding domains in the SlyA-Ef dimer and extending to the dimerization domain could serve as a binding site for a signal molecule. In MexR, a C-terminal tail of the C monomer is inserted into this cavity (7Lim D. Poole K. Strynadka N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29253-29259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The residues lining the cavity are rather hydrophobic but not conserved, suggesting that these proteins respond to different signals. Interestingly, binding of a single ligand molecule to the dimer is expected to perturb the 2-fold symmetry, allowing the molecule to detect differences in the DNA target sequence. A signal molecule could also control spacing between DNA-binding domains by arranging them differently. Another key difference between SlyA and MarR is that the entrance to the cavity in MarR is closed off by two salt bridges between Asp-67 and Arg-73. These interactions are not present in the SlyA or MexR proteins. Recent evidence suggests that SlyA-dependent regulation may involve other protein cofactors such as the cAMP receptor or nitrate reduction regulator (23Westermark M. Oscarsson J. Mizunoe Y. Urbonaviciene J. Uhlin B.E. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6347-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which may involve direct protein-protein interactions. Overall, the SlyA structure is very similar to the structures of MarR and MexR (Fig. 4), showing that the MarR/SlyA family shares a common fold and similar DNA-binding properties despite their low amino acid sequence similarity. However, these proteins show significant local divergence in sequence and structure that apparently allows them to respond to different signal molecules and to bind to diverse DNA targets by using alternative modes of action. The MarR/SlyA structure is an example of a highly adaptable protein fold and provides a plausible explanation for its wide use in transcription regulation in many different organisms.

Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with human muscarinic receptor subtypes underwent apoptotic cell death following treatment with the DNA-damaging agent etoposide. Apoptosis was significantly reduced following muscarinic receptor stimulation of cells that were transfected with receptor subtypes that couple to the Gq/11/phospholipase C pathway, namely M1, M3, and M5. No protection was detected in cells transfected with the Gi-coupled M2 and M4 receptors. Further analysis of the Gq/11-coupled M3 receptor revealed that truncation of the carboxyl-tail (Δ565-M3 mutant) removed the ability of the receptor to protect against etoposide-induced cell death. This mutation did not affect the ability of the receptor to signal through the phospholipase C pathway. Furthermore, activation of the Δ565-M3 receptor resulted in robust activation of the extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun kinase (JNK). The Δ565-M3 receptor mutant also underwent agonist-driven phosphorylation in a similar manner to the wild-type receptor indicating that the anti-apoptotic effect of the M3 receptor is independent of receptor phosphorylation. Consistent with this was the fact that two M3-muscarinic receptor mutants deficient in agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation were capable of producing a full anti-apoptotic response. We conclude that the anti-apoptotic response of the muscarinic receptor family was confined to the Gq/11-coupled members of this family. The direct involvement of Gq/11/phospholipase C signaling and the ERK-1/2 and JNK pathways together with receptor phosphorylation in the anti-apoptotic response were eliminated. Mutation of a poly-basic region within the short C-terminal tail of the M3-muscarinic receptor inhibited the ability of the receptor to induce an anti-apoptotic response. We conclude that the conserved poly-basic region in the C-terminal tail of the M1, M3, and M5 receptors contributes to the ability of these receptors to mediate protection against apoptotic cell death.

Apoptosis or programmed cell death is the process by which cells initiate a series of biochemical reactions that ultimately results in the breakdown of the cell cytoskeleton, destruction of the integrity of the nucleus, and cleavage of cellular DNA, leading to cell death. Apoptosis is manifested during a number of physiological processes, including embryogenesis and development where specific populations of cells are targeted for elimination (1Wylie P.G. Challiss R.A. Blank J.L. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 619-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, it is also now widely appreciated that the process of programmed cell death can play a central role in the onset and development of various disease states, particularly in the mammalian CNS, and is characteristic of such neuronal disorders as Alzheimer's disease and ischemia (2Raff M. Barres B. Burne J. Coles H. Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M. Science. 1993; 262: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1354) Google Scholar). The process of cellular degradation during apoptosis involves the activation of intracellular cysteine proteases (caspases) that cleave substrates after specific aspartate residues. Caspases exist in healthy cells as zymogens with low degradative activity but become fully activated via autocatalytic processing in response to an apoptotic signal (3Adams J. Cory S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 61-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Apoptosis can be induced in mammalian cells by receptor-specific mechanisms (e.g. Fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand or TRAIL) or by the addition of cytotoxic agents (4Konopleva M. Zhao S. Xie Z. Segall H. Younes A. Claxton D.F. Estrov Z. Kornblau S.M. Andreeff M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 457: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, in the case of UV irradiation or the DNA-damaging agent etoposide, apoptosis in cells occurs via biochemical pathways that appear to involve mitochondrial depolarization, an increase in the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and release of apoptogenic factors such as cytochrome c from the inner mitochondrial membrane to the cytosol. Cytosolic cytochrome c is able to interact with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase 9 to form the apoptosome (5Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar, 6Strasser A. O'Connor L. Dixit V.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1387) Google Scholar). The formation of this large multimeric complex is the signal for the autocatalytic processing and activation of pro-caspase 9, which in turn lead to the sequential activation of downstream executioner caspases and degradation of cellular proteins, which ultimately leads to the destruction of the cell cytoskeleton, nuclear structure, and DNA (4Konopleva M. Zhao S. Xie Z. Segall H. Younes A. Claxton D.F. Estrov Z. Kornblau S.M. Andreeff M. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 457: 217-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is now clear that a number of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein-coupled receptor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; [Ca2+]i, intracellular calcium transient; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun kinase; MTT, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide; α-MEM, alpha minimal essential medium; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; CCH, carbachol; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PLC, phospholipase C; PKB, protein kinase B; DEVD-pNA, Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide. have the ability to control apoptosis, either initiating a pro- or anti-apoptotic signal depending on the receptor subtype and cell type in which the receptor is expressed (7Ueda H.

Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Among those receptors initiating an anti-apoptotic signal is the muscarinic receptor family, which is composed of five distinct members, three of which (M1, M3, and M5) are coupled to the Gq/11-phospholipase C pathway and two (M2 and M4) that inhibit adenylate cyclase via coupling to Gi/o (9Caulfield M.P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1993; 58: 319-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Muscarinic receptors (most likely the M3-subtype) expressed endogenously in cerebellar granule cells have been shown to protect against apoptotic-cell death induced by culturing in non-depolarizing conditions (10Yan G.M. Lin S.Z. Irwin R.P. Paul S.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 248-257PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the Gq/11-coupled M1-muscarinic receptor expressed as a recombinant protein in PC-12 cells protected against apoptosis following serum deprivation (11Lindenboim L. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Sokolovsky M. Stein R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which muscarinic receptors are able to attenuate apoptosis is not clear with some studies demonstrating a role for the cell survival pathway mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt (8Murga C. Laguinge L. Wetzker R. Cuadrado A. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19080-19085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and others reporting that this pathway in addition to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and that downstream G-protein-mediated second messenger pathways (e.g. calcium, cAMP, and protein kinase C) are not important (11Lindenboim L. Pinkas-Kramarski R. Sokolovsky M. Stein R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 2491-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 12Leloup C. Michaelson D.M. Fisher A. Hartmann T. Beyreuther K. Stein R. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 825-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the current study we use apoptosis induced by the DNA-damaging agent, etoposide, in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as our experimental model to investigate the properties of the anti-apoptotic response elicited by the muscarinic receptor family. We show that only the muscarinic receptor subtypes coupled to Gq/11-proteins (M1, M3, and M5) elicit an anti-apoptotic response. Further analysis of the M3-muscarinic receptor revealed that the anti-apoptotic signal does not involve direct activation of the Gq/11/phospholipase C-signaling pathway, the MAPK pathway, or receptor phosphorylation but that a conserved poly-basic region within the C-terminal tail of the receptor contributes to the anti-apoptotic response. Etoposide and phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate were from Calbiochem (Nottingham, UK). DEVD-pNA was purchased from Bachem (Merseyside, UK). G418 sulfate and all tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen (Glasgow, UK). Rabbit anti-ERK antisera were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Carbachol chloride, atropine sulfate, and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were from Sigma (Poole, UK). All other chemicals were of research grade and purchased from Fisher (Loughborough, UK). All radiochemicals were purchased from Amersham Biosciences (UK). The specific activities of radionucleotides were 3000 Ci/mmol, 81 Ci/mmol, 10 mCi/ml for [32P]ATP, [3H]N-methylscopolamine, and [32P]orthophosphate, respectively. Generation of Receptor Mutants—The T → A tail mutant was generated by mutating threonines 551, 553, and 554 to alanines by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange, Stratagene) and PCR using the 5′ primer, GCTCTGTGCAACAAAGCATTCAGAGCCGCTTTTAAGATGCTGCTGCTG, and the 3′ primer, CAGCAGCAGCATCTTAAAAGCGGTCCTGAATGCTTTGTTGCACAGAGC. Mutant 6 was produced by the sequential mutation of 16 serines in the third intracellular loop. All serines were mutated to alanine except for serine 450, which was mutated to a glycine. Serine-alanine mutations were at positions 286, 287, 289, 291, 292, 332, 333, 334, 336, 419, 423, 425, 433, 445, and 446. Serine-glycine mutation was carried out at position 450. The Δ565-M3 mutant was produced by introducing a stop codon at position 565 using the 5′ primer, CCCGGATCCATGACCTTGCACAATAACAGTACA, and the 3′ primer, CCCGAATTCCTAGTCACACTGGCACAGCAGCAG. All mutant cDNAs were checked for the correct mutations by sequencing (AltaBioscience, Birmingham, UK). The K → A mutant was produced by mutating 565KKKRRK570 to alanine using the 5′ primer, AAGATGCTGCTGCTGGTCCAGTGTGACGCCGCGGCGGCGGCCGCGCAGCAGTACCAGCAGAGACAGTCGGTC, and the 3′ primer, GACCGACTGTCTCTGCTGGTACTGCTGCGCGGCCGCCGCCGCGGCGTCACACTGGCACAGCAGCAGCATCTT. Tissue Culture—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with cDNA encoding for the wild-type human M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, mutant 6, T → A tail, or Δ565-muscarinic receptor, and stably transfected clones were obtained by G418 sulfate selection. CHO cells stably expressing the muscarinic M1, M2, M3, M4, or M5 receptors at 1.58, 0.75, 0.40, 1.08, and 0.85 pmol/mg of protein respectively, were chosen for further study. CHO cells stably expressing the Δ565-M3,T → A tail, mutant 6, and K → A receptors at 0.35, 0.23, 0.36, and 0.31 pmol/mg of protein were chosen for further study. Stably transfected CHO cells were maintained in α-MEM media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2.5 μg/ml fungi-zone, and 500 μg/ml G418 sulfate. In experiments investigating various M3-muscarinic receptor mutants, at least two clones were tested to eliminate clonal artifacts. Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide Staining—CHO-m3 cells were plated on 25-mm glass coverslips in six-well plates. Following overnight incubation with the appropriate drugs, cells were washed twice with binding buffer. Binding buffer (1 ml) was added together with 5 μl each of annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide to each well. Plates were then incubated for 15 min in the dark at room temperature. Coverslips were washed 3× with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then coated with Citifluor to enhance fluorescence. Annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide-stained cells were visualized on an inverted fluorescence microscope using a dual filter set for FITC and rhodamine. Measurement of Apoptotic DNA Laddering—CHO-m3 cells grown in 10-cm2 plates were treated overnight with the appropriate drugs, and DNA laddering was measured using a commercially available apoptotic DNA laddering kit (Roche Applied Science, Lewes, UK). Floating and adhered cells were collected in PBS/0.5 mm EDTA. Cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min, and pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of PBS. Cells were lysed with 200 μl of lysis buffer (6 m guanidine-HCl, 10 mm urea, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 20% Triton x-100 (v/v), pH 4.4). Samples were then processed as described in the manufacturer's instructions. MTT Assay—CHO-M3 cells grown in 10-cm2 plates were treated overnight with the appropriate drugs, and MTT was added (0.5 mg/ml) to the plates. The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and then floating and adhered cells were collected in PBS/0.5 mm EDTA. An aliquot of cell suspension was used to measure protein concentration. The remainder of the CHO-M3 cell suspension was then centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 3 min, and the resultant cell pellet was dissolved in 100% Me2SO to liberate and solubilize the insoluble formazen product. The level of formazen product was measured spectrophotometrically at 550 nm. Caspase 3 Assay—Sub-confluent cells plated in 10-cm2 plates were treated with the appropriate concentration of etoposide for the desired time. Floating and attached cells were harvested in PBS/0.5 mm EDTA, and cells were centrifuged at 1500 rpm in a bench-top centrifuge. The pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA), and the cells were kept on ice for 10 min. The cell lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 1 min. A Bradford assay was performed on the lysate, and 200–400 μg of cell lysate was diluted 1:2 in reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol) in plastic 96-well plates. 1:10 v/v of 4 mm DEVD-pNA was added to the each well of the 96-well plate, and the plate was kept at 37 °C for 2–4 h. Cleavage of the DEVD-pNA substrate was monitored colorimetrically at 405 nm in a microplate reader. Receptor Phosphorylation—Stably transfected CHO cells were grown in six-well plates. Cells were incubated with 50 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 1 h in phosphate-free Krebs/HEPES buffer (KHB: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 118 mm NaCl, 4.3 mm KCl, 1.17 mm MgSO·7H2O, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 11.7 mm glucose). CCH (1 mm) added for 5 min, and reactions were terminated by aspiration and the addition of 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 1% v/v Nonidet P-40, 0.5% w/v sodium deoxycholate). Receptor expression was determined by [3H]N-methylscopolamine binding (see below) to ensure that an equal number of receptors was present in the lysates. Lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation, and 3 μl of anti-M3 muscarinic receptor antisera was added. Immunocomplexes were precipitated on protein A-Sepharose. Samples were washed four times with TE buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA) and resolved on 8% SDS-PAGE gels. Gels were stained with 0.2% Coomassie Blue to ensure that there was equal immunoprecipitation. The gels were then dried, and phosphoproteins were visualized by autoradiography. Receptor Density Determination—Confluent CHO cells grown in six-well plates were incubated with 0.14 μCi of [3H]N-methylscopolamine for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold KHB and solubilized by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, and receptor number was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined by the inclusion of 10 μm atropine sulfate. ERK and JNK Assays—Stably transfected CHO cells were grown to confluence in six-well plates. CCH (1 mm) was added for the times indicated. For the ERK assay, phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (1 μm) was added for 5 min, and for the JNK assay, 0.3 m sorbitol was added for 30 min. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml benzamidine), and cells were placed on ice for 5 min. Cells were then lysed by scraping, and lysates were pre-cleared by centrifugation. For ERK assays, 0.2 μg of anti-ERK antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added and immunoprecipitations were performed for 1 h at 4 °C. For JNK assays, 5 μg of GST-c-Jun was added and samples placed on a roller for 1 h at 4 °C. For the ERK assay immunocomplexes were isolated on protein A-Sepharose beads, and for the JNK assay JNK·c-Jun complexes were isolated on glutathione-Sepharose beads. Samples were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with assay buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, pH 7.2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm Na3VO4). ERK activity was measured by resuspending the immunocomplexes in assay buffer containing 2 μCi of [32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP, and 200 μm epidermal growth factor receptor peptide (encompassing the region 661–681 of the epidermal growth factor receptor). For JNK assays, JNK·c-Jun complexes were resuspended in assay buffer containing 2 μCi/ml [32P]ATP, 20 μm ATP. For ERK assays, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 25% trichloroacetic acid, and samples were spotted on P81 phosphocellulose squares. P81 squares were washed four times with 0.05% orthophosphoric acid, and the incorporation of radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. For JNK experiments, the assays were terminated by the addition of sample buffer. Samples were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE gels, and phospho-c-Jun was visualized by autoradiography. Quantification of radioactivity incorporated into c-Jun was performed by excising the protein from the Coomassie Blue-stained gel and measuring by scintillation counting. Measurement of [Ca2+]i—CHO cells grown on 22-mm coverslips were loaded with 5 μm fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester for 30 min at 37 °C. Measurement of [Ca2+]i was performed as previously described (13Budd D.C. Challiss R.A. Young K.W. Tobin A.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 813-823PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-apoptotic Response of Gq/11-coupled Muscarinic Receptor Subtypes—Apoptosis is mediated by the activation of caspases that was measured colorimetrically in this study by the cleavage of the peptide substrate DEVD-pNA (see “Materials and Methods”). Treatment of CHO cells stably expressing recombinant human M1–M5 muscarinic receptors showed an increase in caspase activity following an overnight treatment with the DNA-damaging agent, etoposide (Fig. 1). This increase in caspase activity was significantly attenuated by muscarinic receptor stimulation in cells expressing the M1, M3, or M5 muscarinic receptor subtypes (Fig. 1: 59.0 ± 1.0%, n = 4; 51.6 ± 1.2%, n = 3; and 54.4 ± 0.2%, n = 4 for M1, M3, and M5, respectively). In contrast, muscarinic receptor stimulation of cells expressing the M2or M4-muscarinic receptor subtypes had no significant affect on etoposide-mediated caspase activation (Fig. 1: 95.0 ± 11.0%, n = 3; 93.1 ± 1.0%, n = 4 for the M2and M4-muscarinic receptor, respectively). Characterization of the Anti-apoptotic Response of the M3muscarinic Receptor—Detailed characterization of the anti-apoptotic response shown by the Gq/11-coupled muscarinic receptors was investigated in CHO cells expressing the recombinant human M3-muscarinic receptor (CHO-M3 cells). The appearance of phosphatidylserine on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane is a marker of apoptosis and can be detected by utilizing the extremely high affinity that annexin V exhibits for this phospholipid (14Montaville P. Neumann J. Russo-Marie F. Ochsenbein F. Sanson A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24684-24693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Phase-contrast images of CHO-M3 cells showed that an overnight treatment with etoposide resulted in a marked reduction in cell number with a large percentage of cells displaying phenotypic features characteristic of apoptosis such as cell rounding, membrane blebbing, and annexin V-FITC binding (Fig. 2). Significant inhibition of these markers of apoptosis was observed in CHO-M3 cells treated with the muscarinic agonist carbachol (Fig. 2). In particular, the increase in annexin V-FITC staining observed following etoposide treatment was markedly reduced by muscarinic receptor stimulation (Fig. 2). As a control for necrotic cell death, CHO-M3 cells treated with etoposide, etoposide and carbachol, or vehicle were stained with propidium iodide as a marker of necrosis. No significant difference in propidium iodide staining was observed with the different cell treatments, consistent with apoptotic rather than necrotic cell death (data not shown). During the later stages of apoptosis caspase-dependent DNase activation results in the degradation of genomic DNA that is characterized by a 200-bp DNA ladder (15Enari M. Sakahira H. Yokoyama H. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Nagata S. Nature. 1998; 391: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (2812) Google Scholar). Following an overnight treatment of CHO-M3 cells with etoposide, the extracted genomic DNA shows a distinctive apoptotic DNA ladder that was attenuated by muscarinic receptor stimulation (Fig. 3). These data, combined with the measurement of caspase activity (Fig. 1) and the determination of annexin V staining (Fig. 2), are consistent with etoposide mediating apoptosis in CHO-M3 cells, and stimulation of the M3-muscarinic receptor results in attenuation of this apoptotic response. The reduction of MTT to an insoluble formazen product is catalyzed by mitochondrial succinate dehydrogenase and is used as measure of cellular viability (16Berridge M.V. Tan A.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 474-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). An overnight treatment of CHO-M3 cells with etoposide resulted in an inhibition in the level of MTT reduction compared with CHO-M3 cells treated with vehicle only, confirming that the apoptotic agent reduces the viability of the cell population (Fig. 4). Stimulation of the M3-muscarinic receptor prevented this reduction in cellular viability induced by etoposide treatment (Fig. 4). Characterization of the M3-muscarinic Receptor Anti-apoptotic Response—We explored the kinetics of the muscarinic-induced protection of CHO-M3 cells by treating cells with carbachol for various time periods. M3-muscarinic receptor signaling was terminated by the addition of atropine (0.5 μm) followed by three washes with α-MEM. Apoptosis was then induced by an overnight treatment of cells with etoposide. Surprisingly, muscarinic receptor-mediated protection was induced extremely rapidly, because a brief 0.5-min exposure of CHO-M3 cells to carbachol resulted in a maximal anti-apoptotic response to a subsequent overnight exposure to etoposide (Fig. 5A). It should be noted that the continued presence of muscarinic receptor stimulation was not necessary to provide protection from etoposide-induced cell death. The suppression of cell death by the M3-muscarinic receptor was also dose-dependent with an EC50 of 4.9 μm (Fig. 5, B and C). We have utilized chemical inhibitors of ERK, p38, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) to determine whether these signaling components play any role in mediating the anti-apoptotic response of the M3-muscarinic receptor. All the chemical inhibitors were tested for their expected activity in cell signaling experiments in CHO-M3 cells (data not shown). Inhibition of ERK and p38 with PD98059 (50 μm) and SB202190 (10 μm), respectively, had little affect on the M3-muscarinic receptor protective response (data not shown). Importantly, these inhibitors did not mediate an apoptotic response in their own right. Likewise, inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin (100 nm) alone did not induce cell death. However, incubation of CHO-M3 cells with wortmannin (100 nm) had no significant affect on the ability of the M3-muscarinic receptor to induce protection against etoposide-mediated cell death (data not shown). Functional Role of the C-terminal Tail of the M3-muscarinic Receptor in the Anti-apoptotic Mechanism—Sequence alignment of the five members of the muscarinic receptor family revealed that the C-terminal tail of the Gq/11-coupled receptors all share a degree of homology in the membrane distal portion that is not present in the Gi/o-coupled members (Fig. 6A). To address the functional role of the C-terminal tail in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of the Gq/11-coupled muscarinic receptors, we truncated the M3-muscarinic receptor C-terminal tail at position 565 (Δ565-M3, Fig. 6B). These receptors were stably expressed in CHO cells at the plasma membrane as determined by ligand binding using the hydrophilic muscarinic receptor antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine (see “Materials and Methods”). Furthermore, this mutant receptor was able to signal through phospholipase C/calcium and the MAPK kinase pathways in a similar manner to the wild-type receptor (see below). Care was taken to select mutant receptor cell lines that expressed similar levels of receptor to wild-type receptor cell lines for these studies (see “Materials and Methods”). Overnight treatment of CHO cells stably expressing the Δ565-M3 receptor with etoposide lead to a significant increase in caspase activity. However, in contrast to the wild-type receptor, activation of the Δ565-M3 muscarinic receptor was unable to prevent etoposide-mediated caspase activation (Fig. 7A). These data, together with the sequence alignment of the C-terminal tails of muscarinic receptor, suggest that the C-terminal tail region of the M3-muscarinic receptor and particularly the poly-basic region in the membrane proximal region (Fig. 6A) may be central in allowing the receptor to inhibit etoposide-mediated cell death in CHO cells. To test the importance of the poly-basic region of the C-terminal tail in mediating the anti-apoptotic response of the M3-muscarinic receptor, we produced a receptor mutant where the basic residues in the region 565KKKRRK570 were mutated to alanine (K → A) (Fig. 6B). These receptors were stably expressed in CHO cells at the plasma membrane as determined by ligand binding using the hydrophilic muscarinic receptor antagonist [3H]N-methylscopolamine (see “Materials and Methods”). As observed with CHO cells expressing the Δ565-M3 receptor, activation of the K → A receptor significantly attenuated the ability of etoposide to induce activation of caspase 3 (Fig. 7B). These data strongly suggest that the conserved poly-basic region in the C-terminal tail of the muscarinic M3 receptor plays an important role in mediating the anti-apoptotic effects of the receptor. The M3-muscarinic Receptor-mediated Anti-apoptotic Response Is Independent of Receptor Phosphorylation—We have previously shown that M3-muscarinic receptors are subject to rapid agonist-driven phosphorylation (17Tobin A.B. Pharmacol. Ther. 1997; 75: 135-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Budd D.C. McDonald J.E. Tobin A.B. J. Biol.

In particular, the enzymatic active site and adjacent subsites bind sequential phosphoryl groups in the RNA backbone through Coulombic interactions. Here, oligomers of vinylsulfonic acid (OVS) are shown to be potent inhibitors of RNase A that exploit these interactions. Inhibition is competitive with substrate and has Ki = 11 pm in assays at low salt concentration. The effect of salt concentration on inhibition indicates that nearly eight favorable Coulombic interactions occur in the RNase A·OVS complex. The phosphonic acid and sulfuric acid analogs of OVS are also potent inhibitors although slightly less effective. OVS is also shown to be a contaminant of MES and other buffers that contain sulfonylethyl groups. Oligomers greater than nine units in length can be isolated from commercial MES buffer. Inhibition by contaminating OVS is responsible for the apparent decrease in catalytic activity that has been observed in assays of RNase A at low salt concentration. Thus, OVS is both a useful inhibitor of RNase A and a potential bane to chemists and biochemists who use ethanesulfonic acid buffers.

RNA is the least stable of the biopolymers that effect information transfer in biology (1Wolfenden R. Snider M.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 2001; 34: 938-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Yet, the lifetime of RNA in vivo is most often determined by the rate of its enzymatic degradation (2Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In vitro, ribonuclease inhibitors are often employed to mitigate damage to RNA from incidental contamination with secretory ribonucleases such as the human homolog of ribonuclease A (RNase A, 1The abbreviations used are: RNase A, ribonuclease A; 6-FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; 6-TAMRA, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; OVS, oligo(vinylsulfonic acid); poly(C), poly(cytidylic acid); PVP, poly(vinylphosphonic acid); PVOS, poly(vinylsulfuric acid); F, fluorescence; ddH2O, double distilled H2O; bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. 1The abbreviations used are: RNase A, ribonuclease A; 6-FAM, 6-carboxyfluorescein; 6-TAMRA, 6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; BES, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]ethanesulfonic acid; CHES, 2-(cyclohexylamino)ethanesulfonic acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; OVS, oligo(vinylsulfonic acid); poly(C), poly(cytidylic acid); PVP, poly(vinylphosphonic acid); PVOS, poly(vinylsulfuric acid); F, fluorescence; ddH2O, double distilled H2O; bistris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol. EC 3.1.27.5) (3Raines R.T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1045-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar). The abundance and diversity of natural ribonucleases has led to an ever-increasing interest in inhibitor design and discovery (4Russo A. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 629-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Similar to most known ribonucleases, RNase A can make multiple contacts with an RNA substrate (Fig. 1). The enzymatic active site and adjacent subsites bind sequential phosphoryl groups in the RNA backbone through Coulombic interactions (5Fontecilla-Camps J.C. de Llorens R. le Du M.H. Cuchillo C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21526-21531Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most potent RNase A inhibitors take advantage of this extended interface. For example, a pyrophosphate-linked oligonucleotide (pdUppA-3′-p), which occupies three subsites, is the tightest known small-molecule inhibitor of RNase A (4Russo A. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 629-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Nature also uses this strategy to inhibit RNase A and its homologs. The 50-kDa ribonuclease inhibitor protein forms a tight 1:1 complex with RNase A (Kd ∼10-14m) (6Lee F.S. Shapiro R. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), chelating all of its phosphoryl group binding subsites (7Kobe B. Deisenhofer J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1028-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The utility of pyrophosphate-linked oligonucleotides and ribonuclease inhibitor is limited, both by the difficulty and expense of their production and by their intrinsic instability. For example, pyrophosphate-linked oligonucleotides are susceptible to hydrolysis (8Russo N. Shapiro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14902-14908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and ribonuclease inhibitor is readily inactivated by oxidation (9Kim B.-M. Schultz L.W. Raines R.T. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). While studying RNase A catalysis as a function of salt concentration, we found that a contaminant in common biological buffers was a potent inhibitor in solutions of low salt concentrations (10Park C. Raines R.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We estimated that Ki for this inhibitor was ∼0.1 nm, which is 102-fold lower than that for any other small-molecule RNase A inhibitor. Herein, we identified this inhibitor as a byproduct of the synthesis of commercial buffers containing sulfonylethyl groups. Next, we found that this inhibitor acts in a competitive manner and is the most potent known small-molecule inhibitor of a ribonuclease. In addition, we identified the number of Coulombic interactions that the inhibitor makes upon binding to RNase A. Finally, we examined RNase A inhibition by analogs of the inhibitor. Materials—Poly(cytidylic acid) (poly(C)) was from Midland Certified Reagents (Midland, TX). Poly(C) was purified prior to use by precipitation in aqueous ethanol (70% v/v). The fluorogenic ribonuclease substrate 6-FAM∼dArUdAdA∼6-TAMRA (where 6-FAM is a 5′-6-carboxyfluorescein group and 6-TAMRA is a 3′-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine group) was from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Oligo(vinylsulfonic acid) (Mr ∼2,000) and poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (Mr ∼20,000) were from Polysciences (Warrington, PA). Vinylsulfonic acid and poly(vinylsulfuric acid) (Mr ∼170,000) were from Aldrich. All other commercial chemicals and biochemicals were of reagent grade or better and were used without further purification. Synthesis of Diethanesulfonic Acid Ether (3Raines R.T. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 1045-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (851) Google Scholar)—2-Mercaptoethylether (5.0 g, 36.2 mmol, Caution: Stench!, Aldrich) was dissolved in glacial acetic acid (5 ml). The resulting solution was then cooled to 0 °C. While stirring at 0 °C, a mixture (50:45 ml) of glacial acetic acid and aqueous hydrogen peroxide (30% v/v) was added to the solution dropwise over 1 h. The reaction mixture was then heated at 60 °C for 90 min. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The addition of toluene enabled residual acetic acid to form azeotropes of low boiling point. The resulting yellow oil was used without further purification (spectral data: 1H NMR (300 MHz, D2O) δ 2.88 (t, J = 7.1 Hz, 4H), 2.17 (t, J = 7.0 Hz, 4H) ppm; mass spectrometry (electrospray ionization) m/z 232.9791 (M-H [C4H9O7S2] = 232.9795)). Instruments—UV absorbance measurements were made with a Cary Model 3 spectrophotometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA). Fluorescence measurements were made with a QuantaMaster 1 photon counting fluorometer equipped with sample stirring (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ). Production of RNase A—Plasmid pBXR (11delCardayré S.B. Ribé M. Yokel E.M. Quirk D.J. Rutter W.J. Raines R.T. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 261-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) directs the production of RNase A in Escherichia coli. RNase A was produced and purified as described previously (12Kim J.-S. Raines R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17392-17396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) transformed with pBXR was grown to an optical density of 1.8 at 600 nm in terrific broth medium containing ampicillin (0.40 mg/ml). The expression of the RNase A cDNA was induced by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm. Cells were collected 4 h after induction and lysed with a French pressure cell. Inclusion bodies were recovered by centrifugation and resuspended for 2 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing guanidine-HCl (7 m), dithiothreitol (0.10 m), and EDTA (10 mm). The protein solution was diluted 10-fold with aqueous acetic acid (20 mm), subjected to centrifugation to remove any precipitate, and dialyzed overnight against aqueous acetic acid (20 mm). Any precipitate was removed again by centrifugation. The supernatant was diluted to a protein concentration near 0.5 mg/ml in a refolding solution of 0.10 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing NaCl (0.10 m), reduced glutathione (1.0 mm), and oxidized glutathione (0.2 mm). RNase A was refolded for 16 h and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a YM10 membrane (Mr 10,000 cut-off, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Concentrated RNase A was applied to a Superdex G-75 gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing NaCl (0.10 m) and NaN3 (0.02% w/v). Protein from the major A280 peak was collected and applied to a Mono S cation-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column. RNase A was eluted from the column with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.2–0.4 m) in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0. Protein concentration was determined by UV spectroscopy using ϵ = 0.72 ml mg-1 cm-1 at 278 nm (13Sela M. Anfinsen C.B. Harrington W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 502-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Inhibition of RNase A Catalysis—Inhibition of ribonucleolytic activity was measured by using either poly(C) or a fluorogenic substrate. The total cytidyl concentration of poly(C) was quantitated using ϵ = 6,200 m-1 cm-1 at 268 nm (14Yakovlev G.I. Moiseyev G.P. Bezborodova S.I. Both V. Sevcik J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 204: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The cleavage of poly(C) was monitored by the decrease in ultraviolet hypochromicity. The Δϵ value for this reaction calculated from the difference in molar absorptivity of the polymeric substrate and the mononucleotide cyclic phosphate product was 2,380 mm-1 cm-1 at 250 nm (15delCardayré S.B. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6031-6037Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Assays were performed at 25 °C in 50 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (0.10 m), poly(C) (10 μm-1.5 mm), OVS (0–1.43 μm), and enzyme (1.0 nm). Molar values of OVS were calculated by using its average molecular mass of 2,000 g/mol. It is possible that a polymer of this size could bind two enzymes. Thus, the actual Ki values could be 2-fold higher. Kinetic parameters were determined from initial velocity data with the program DELTAGRAPH 4.0 (DeltaPoint, Monterey, CA). For the fluorescence assay, the inhibition of ribonucleolytic activity was assessed at 25 °C in 2.0 ml of 50 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (0–0.25 m), 6-FAM∼dArUdAdA∼6-TAMRA (60 nm), and RNase A (1–5pm) as described previously (16Kelemen B.R.

Fluorescence (F) was measured using 493 and 515 nm as the excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. The value of ΔF/Δt was measured for 3 min after the addition of RNase A. An aliquot of inhibitor (I) dissolved in the assay buffer was added next, and ΔF/Δt was measured in the presence of the inhibitor for 3 min. The concentration of inhibitor in the assay was doubled repeatedly in 3-min intervals. Excess RNase A was then added to the mixture to ensure that <10% substrate had been cleaved prior to completion of the inhibition assay. Apparent changes in ribonucleolytic activity due to dilution were corrected by comparing values to an assay in which aliquots of buffer were added to the assay. Values of Ki were determined by non-linear least squares regression analysis of data fitted to Equation 1 (16Kelemen B.R. Klink T.A. Behlke M.A. Eubanks S.R. Leland P.A. Raines R.T.

ΔF/Δt=(ΔF/Δt)0(Ki/(Ki+[I]))(Eq. 1) At 0 m NaCl, the enzyme concentration ([E]total) caused a significant depletion in inhibitor concentration, thus the data were fitted to Equation 2, which describes tight-binding inhibition (18Henderson P.J.F.

ΔF/Δt=((ΔF/Δt)0/2[E]total){[(Ki+[I]−[E]total]2+4Ki[E]total)1/2−(Ki+[I]−[E]total)}(Eq. 2) In Equations 1 and 2, (ΔF/Δt)0 was the ribonucleolytic activity prior to inhibitor addition. Purification of Inhibitor from a Commercial Buffer—Previously, we reported that a contaminant in MES buffer inhibits catalysis by RNase A, especially in solutions of low salt concentration (10Park C. Raines R.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We subsequently found that other ethanesulfonic acid buffers (i.e. “Good” buffers) (19Good N.E. Winget G.D. Winter W. Connolly T.N. Izawa S. Singh R.M. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar), such as BES, CHES, and PIPES, similarly inhibited RNase A (data not shown). Thus, we speculated that the inhibitor was a byproduct of ethanesulfonic acid buffer synthesis. We have shown that the byproduct responsible for RNase A inhibition would probably be anionic (10Park C. Raines R.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) because the RNase A active site and RNA binding sites are cationic (pI = 9.3) (20Ui N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 229: 567-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Thus, we chose to purify the inhibitor by anion-exchange chromatography. The low concentration of this inhibitor in MES buffer (∼2 ppm) (10Park C. Raines R.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) necessitated purifying the contaminant from a large amount of MES buffer. We first tested the inhibitory activity of a number of different commercial lots of MES buffer. All of the MES buffers tested exhibited substantial RNase A inhibition at low salt concentrations, but the inhibition per mol of MES did vary by 20-fold in different lots. Thus, we passed 0.50 kg of the most inhibitory MES buffer (Sigma, 5.0 liters of a 0.50 m solution, pH 3.0) through a column containing 50 g of AG® 1-X8 anion-exchange resin (chloride form, Bio-Rad). No inhibitory activity was detected in the flow-through, indicating that the inhibitor was anionic and could be purified with anion-exchange chromatography. 2Of note, the flow-through of this column can be recrystallized from water to yield MES buffer that is devoid of inhibitor. Likewise, no inhibitory activity was observed in a 0.1 m HCl wash of the column. The inhibitor was eluted with a 1–4 m linear gradient of HCl. Inhibitory activity was found in fractions corresponding to 1.7–4 m HCl. These fractions were pooled and evaporated to dryness, yielding 40 mg of material. Identification of Inhibitor—In ethanesulfonic acid buffer synthesis, a nucleophile attacks 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid in H2O to yield the buffer product (Fig. 2). Hydrolysis or β-elimination of 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid could yield 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid (1) or vinylsulfonic acid (2). Nucleophilic attack of 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid on 2-bromoethanesulfonic acid or Michael addition to vinylsulfonic acid could generate diethanesulfonic acid ether (3). Indeed, all three of these byproducts were identified by NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry in the material purified from MES buffer (data not shown). Commercial 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid (1) and vinylsulfonic acid (2) were tested as inhibitors of RNase A. Neither was a potent inhibitor in solutions of low salt concentration (Fig. 2). 3In contrast, divinylsulfone (CH2CHS(O)2CHCH2) is an irreversible inhibitor of RNase A, forming covalent bonds to active-site residues by Michael addition (21Ciglic M.I. Jackson P.J. Raillard S.A. Haugg M. Jermann T.M. Opitz J.G. Trabesinger-Ruf N. Benner S.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4008-4022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mechanism-based inactivation of RNase A by Michael addition has also been described previously (22Stowell J.K. Widlanski T.S. Kutateladze T.G. Raines R.T. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 6930-6936Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Diethanesulfonic acid ether (3) was synthesized (vide supra) but likewise failed to inhibit RNase A. Thus, the sought-after inhibitor was not byproduct 1, 2, or 3. We next used a Vivaspin concentrator (5,000 molecular weight cut-off, Vivascience AG, Hannover, Germany) to purify the inhibitor based on its affinity for RNase A. RNase A (10 mg) was mixed in ddH2O (10 ml) with the inhibitor (10 mg) that had been purified by anion-exchange chromatography. The sample was subjected to centrifugation at 6,000 rpm for 15 min, washed with ddH2O (3 × 15 ml), and subjected again to centrifugation. Molecules that bind tightly to RNase A remained in the retentate, whereas impurities were washed into the eluate. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of the retentate containing RNase A and the inhibitor revealed a heterogeneous mixture of small molecules of a molecular mass of 900–2,000 g/mol. The inhibitor was then separated from RNase A by adding a solution of ammonium acetate (0.10 m) to the mixture. After repeatedly concentrating and adding ammonium acetate solution to the mixture, unbound inhibitor moved to the eluate, whereas RNase A remained in the retentate. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry of the free inhibitor revealed the same heterogeneous distribution of molecular mass with individual peaks separated by 108 g/mol (Fig. 3). Because the molecular mass of vinylsulfonic acid (2) is 108 g/mol, we reasoned that the inhibitor was probably an oligomer of vinylsulfonic acid (OVS, 4). Similar to byproducts 1-3, OVS is probably a byproduct of ethanesulfonic acid buffer synthesis with ultraviolet light possibly initiating the radical-mediated polymerization of vinylsulfonic acid (3) (Fig. 2) (23Breslow D.S. Hulse G.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1954; 76: 6399-6401Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Characterization of Inhibition by OVS—Inhibition of RNase A activity was measured in 0.05 m imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (0.10 m) and commercial OVS (Mr ∼2,000, 0–1.43 μm). OVS inhibition of RNase A is not time-dependent (data not shown). The addition of NaCl diminishes the OVS inhibition of RNase A, indicating that OVS is a reversible inhibitor of the enzyme. OVS inhibits RNase A at concentrations well below that of substrate; thus, inhibition by OVS is not attributed to its sequestering of RNA. Double-reciprocal plots of RNase A catalytic activity versus the concentration of poly(C) at different OVS concentrations reveal that OVS inhibits RNase A in a competitive manner (Fig. 4). With poly(C) as a substrate, the apparent Ki = (0.40 ± 0.03) μm at 0.10 m NaCl. A replot of (Km/Vmax)appversus [OVS] reveals a straight line, which is indicative of simple competitive inhibition (24Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1977; 45: 273-387PubMed Google Scholar). Salt Dependence of Inhibition by OVS—The Ki of OVS was measured at four different salt concentrations in 50 mm imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 6.0. Because OVS inhibits RNase A in a competitive manner, we were able to use a sensitive fluorescent assay to assess inhibition by OVS. OVS inhibition of RNase A is highly salt-dependent (Fig. 5A). At 0 m NaCl, OVS inhibits catalysis by RNase A with an astonishingly low inhibition constant of Ki = (11 ± 2) pm. At 0 m NaCl, the inhibition curve was fitted to a tight-binding inhibitor equation, yet the curve still exhibits some cooperativity. At 0.10 m NaCl, OVS inhibits RNase A with an inhibition constant of Ki = (120 ± 10) nm. 4In theory, the value of Ki for a competitive inhibitor should be independent of the substrate used in the assay. Yet, the observed value of Ki for OVS is 3-fold higher when poly(C) rather than 6-FAM∼dArUdAdA∼6-TAMRA is the substrate for RNase A. This effect of polymeric substrates has much precedence and several proposed explanations (25Nelson C.A. Hummel J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 3173-3176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 418-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. IV. Academic Press, New York1971: 647-806Google Scholar). According to polyelectrolyte theory, the slope of a plot of log(Ki) versus log([cation]) reveals the number of Coulombic interactions between a ligand and a polyanion (28Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. de Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). OVS makes on average 7.8 ionic interactions with RNase A (Fig. 5B). Poly-(vinylsulfuric acid), an OVS analog, exhibits a similar salt dependence (data not shown). RNase A Inhibition by OVS Analogs—To assess the importance of the sulfonic acid group for RNase A inhibition, we tested poly(vinylphosphonic acid) (PVP) and poly(vinylsulfuric acid) (PVOS) for inhibition of ribonucleolytic activity in our fluorescent assay. These analogs are also good inhibitors of RNase A but are slightly less effective than is OVS (Table I). The average molecular masses of PVP and PVOS were 20,000 and 170,000 g/mol, respectively. Nevertheless, by mass spectrometry, the minimum number of OVS units that bound tightly to RNase A was nine. Thus, each chain of commercial OVS (∼2,000 g/mol) could tightly bind to two RNase A molecules per chain, whereas each chain of PVP or PVOS could tightly bind to more. Hence, to enable a direct comparison of inhibition by OVS, PVP, and PVOS, the data listed in Table I are in units of mass rather than moles.Table IInhibition of ribonuclease A catalysis by commercial oligo(vinylsulfonic acid) and its phosphonic acid and sulfuric acid analogsInhibitorKiaValues of Ki were obtained in 0.05 mM imidazole-HCl buffer, pH 6.0, containing NaCl (0.10 M).

Values of Ki are in units of μg/ml to account for the different average molecular mass of each polymer Open table in a new tab Purification and Characterization of Inhibitor—OVS is an extremely low level contaminant in MES buffer (∼2 ppm) (10Park C. Raines R.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, its purification is problematic. We were able to isolate <2 mg of OVS from 0.5 kg of MES buffer. This material was difficult to separate from other anionic byproducts of ethanesulfonic acid buffer synthesis (Fig. 2). OVS has no distinct properties that allow it to be detected during purification. NMR spectroscopy failed to detect OVS in the material purified from MES, because <5% of that material was OVS. However, mass spectrometry did enable the identification of OVS in MES buffer as the cause of RNase A inhibition in solutions of low salt concentration (Fig. 3). Specifically, oligomers of 9–17 units were responsible for the inhibition. It is probable that oligomers shorter than 9 units in length are also present in MES buffer, but these were not observed after anion-exchange chromatography and affinity purification. Because purification of the inhibitor was monitored by RNase A inhibition assays, oligomers of fewer than 9 units are probably less-effective inhibitors of RNase A. After our identification of OVS in MES buffer, we found a previous report (29Niehaus W.G. Flynn T. Mycopathologia. 1993; 123: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) that large polymers (∼50,000 g/mol) of poly(vinylsulfonic acid) comprised ∼1% of a single lot of MES buffer (29Niehaus W.G. Flynn T. Mycopathologia. 1993; 123: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This lot of MES buffer inhibited the catalytic activity of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase. Other lots of MES buffer failed to inhibit the enzyme because only long polymers were inhibitory (30Niehaus W.G. White R.H. Richardson S.B. Bourne A. Ray W.K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 324: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We suspect that oligo(vinylsulfonic acid) and occasionally poly(vinylsulfonic acid) contaminate commercial MES buffer and other ethanesulfonic acid buffers and that the amount of these contaminants varies from lot to lot. Kinetic Analyses—OVS inhibition of RNase A follows a simple competitive model (Fig. 4). Because OVS (∼2000 g/mol) has on average only 18 monomer units per molecule, it is on the cusp of consideration as a polyelectrolyte (28Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. de Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, a double-log plot of Kiversus [cation] indicates that OVS forms 7.8 Coulombic interactions with RNase A (Fig. 5B). The inhibition of RNase A by poly(vinylsulfuric acid) (∼170,000 g/mol) shows a similar salt dependence (data not shown). The number of Coulombic interactions between OVS and RNase A is in gratifying agreement with a previous report (28Record Jr., M.T. Lohman T.M. de Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar) that single-stranded DNA forms 7 Coulombic interactions with RNase A. Thus, OVS probably saturates the same phosphoryl group binding subsites as does a single-stranded nucleic acid (Fig. 1). Multivalent Inhibition—Polyanions are known to be effective inhibitors of RNase A (27Richards F.M. Wyckoff H.W. Boyer P.D. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. IV. Academic Press, New York1971: 647-806Google Scholar). Heparin, tyrosine-glutamate copolymers, and many different polysulfates and polyphosphates have been shown previously to inhibit catalysis by the enzyme (26Sela M. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 418-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Zöllner N. Fellig J. Am. J. Physiol. 1953; 173: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 32Heymann H. Gulick Z.R. Boer C.J.D. de Stevens G. Mayer R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1958; 73: 366-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). We were surprised to learn that 40 years ago, even poly(vinylsulfonic acid) had been tested as an inhibitor of RNase A. Those data suggested that poly(vinylsulfonic acid) was a worse inhibitor of RNase A than other polyanions (33Fellig J. Wiley C.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 85: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 34Littauer U.Z. Sela M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1962; 61: 609-611Google Scholar), or alternatively, that only long polymers (>9,000 g/mol) were good inhibitors of RNase A (35Bach M.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1964; 91: 619-626PubMed Google Scholar). We do not know the basis for the disparity with our data. OVS, like PVP and PVOS, is similar to a nucleic acid backbone in having anionic non-bridging oxygen atoms. In addition, the phosphorous atoms in a nucleic acid and alternating sulfur atoms in OVS are separated by five other atoms. However, there is a major difference between OVS and a nucleic acid. With its three non-bridging oxygens per monomer unit, OVS provides many more opportunities to form strong hydrogen bonds than does a nucleic acid. Pyrophosphate-linked ribonuclease inhibitors also display extra non-bridging oxygens, which probably enhance their affinity for RNase A (8Russo N. Shapiro R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14902-14908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). OVS compares favorably with the most potent known small-molecule inhibitor of RNase A, a pyrophosphate-linked oligonucleotide, pdUppA-3′-p (4Russo A. Acharya K.R. Shapiro R. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 341: 629-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Under similar buffer conditions with 0.10 m NaCl, each has a Ki near 120 nm. Yet, unlike pdUppA-3′-p, OVS is simple to prepare and is extremely stable. Accordingly, OVS could be useful in preventing incidental ribonuclease contamination and RNA degradation in experiments involving RNA. Indeed, poly(vinylsulfuric acid), an OVS analog, has been added to experiments involving the isolation of mRNA (36Cheng T. Polmar S.K. Kazazian Jr., H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 1781-1786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or cell-free translation (37Mach B. Koblet H. Gros D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Other enzymes are known to be inhibited by poly(vinylsulfonic acid). For example, poly(vinylsulfonic acid) inhibits catalysis by RNA polymerase and reverse transcriptase (38Chambon P. Ramuz M. Mandel P. Doly J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 149: 584-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 39Althaus I.W. LeMay R.J. Gonzales A.J. Deibel M.R. Sharma S.K. Kezdy F.J. Resnick L. Busso M.E. Aristoff P.A. Reusser F. Experientia. 1992; 48: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We believe that OVS could be an inhibitor of any enzyme that binds strands of RNA or DNA. Buffer Contamination—The presence of OVS in all lots of MES buffer tested herein and in many other ethanesulfonic acid buffers is troubling. The amount of OVS varies from lot to lot, and thus, some lots of buffers could contain high concentrations of OVS. We recommend that all ethansulfonic acid buffers be purified by anion-exchange chromatography prior to their use in assays of enzymatic activity. Alternatively, an OVS-free buffer should be used instead. Imidazole, bis-tris, and Tris buffer are suitable alternatives, depending on the pH of the assay. MES buffer has been the buffer of choice in assays of the catalytic activity of RNase A, as the pKa of MES buffer (pKa = 6.15) (19Good N.E. Winget G.D. Winter W. Connolly T.N. Izawa S. Singh R.M. Biochemistry. 1966; 5: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (2137) Google Scholar) is near the pH of maximal activity (pH = 6.0) (40del Rosario E.J. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1969; 8: 1884-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Many RNase A assays are performed in the presence of 0.10 m NaCl at which the Ki of OVS is ∼120 nm (Fig. 5A). We find that the OVS concentration in many lots of MES buffer is near 2 ppm. In 0.10 m MES buffer, the concentration of OVS is near 0.2 μm, which is greater than its Ki value. Historically, RNase A has been reported to have a bell-shaped salt-rate profile with an optimum salt concentration near 0.1 m NaCl (41Edelhoch H. Coleman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1956; 219: 351-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Irie M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1965; 57: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 43Libonati M. Sorrentino S. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 117: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We believe that this observed bell shape is an artifact because of contaminating OVS in MES buffer. Indeed, the salt-rate profile of RNase A has been measured recently in bis-tris buffer, revealing that ribonucleolytic activity increases to the diffusion limit as salt concentration decreases (10Park C. Raines R.T. FEBS Lett. 2000; 468: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 44Park C. Raines R.T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11472-11479Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 45Park C. Raines R.T. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3509-3518Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We have found that OVS is a common contaminant of ethanesulfonic acid buffers. Although present in only ppm concentrations, OVS is a potent inhibitor of RNase A, making nearly 8 favorable Coulombic interactions with the enzyme. OVS is inexpensive and extremely stable, unlike other known ribonuclease inhibitors. Accordingly, OVS has the potential to be a useful prophylactic in many chemical, biochemical, and biotechnical experiments involving RNA. Finally, we note that the purity of the buffer used to assay RNase A and other enzymes deserves special consideration."
https://openalex.org/W1975503377,"Rolling circle replication has previously been reconstituted <i>in vitro</i> using M13 duplex circles containing preformed forks and the 10 purified T4 bacteriophage replication proteins. Leading and lagging strand synthesis in these reactions is coupled and the size of the Okazaki fragments produced is typical of those generated in T4 infections. In this study the structure of the DNAs and DNA-protein complexes engaged in these <i>in vitro</i> reactions has been examined by electron microscopy. Following deproteinization, circular duplex templates with linear tails as great as 100 kb are observed. The tails are fully duplex except for one to three single-stranded DNA segments close to the fork. This pattern reflects Okazaki fragments stopped at different stages in their synthesis. Examination of the DNA-protein complexes in these reactions reveals M13 duplex circles in which 64% contain a single large protein mass (replication complex) and a linear duplex tail. In 56% of the replicating molecules with a tail there is at least one fully duplex loop at the replication complex resulting from the portion of the lagging strand engaged in Okazaki fragment synthesis folding back to the replisome. The single-stranded DNA segments at the fork bound by gene 32 and 59 proteins are not extended but rather appear organized into highly compact structures (""bobbins""). These bobbins constitute a major portion of the mass of the full replication complex."

It is an integral 110-kDa membrane protein belonging to the family of P-type ATPases, in which autophosphorylation by ATP of a conserved aspartic acid residue is coupled to conformational changes resulting in ion translocation (Scheme 1). The high resolution x-ray structure of the Ca2+-ATPase crystallized in a Ca2+-bound dephospho form (presumably corresponding to E1Ca2 in Scheme 1) has revealed that the enzyme is made up of 10 membrane-spanning helices and a large cytoplasmic head that binds ATP and catalyzes its hydrolysis to yield ADP and Pi. The head consists of three well defined domains: the nucleotide-binding domain (“domain N,” supposed to bind the adenosine part of ATP), phosphorylation domain (“domain P” with Asp351, which is phosphorylated), and actuator domain (“domain A,” believed to undergo large movements during the reaction cycle) (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). The catalytic site may, at different stages of the transport cycle, consist of residues contributed from all three head domains, and many questions regarding the nature of the nucleotide-binding site(s) are unresolved.

Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The location of TNP-AMP in the crystal structure, obtained from a difference Fourier map following soaking of the E1Ca2 crystals in a solution containing TNP-AMP, supported involvement of these residues in the binding of nucleotide, and in addition revealed the proximity of TNP-AMP to several other residues, including Thr441, Glu442, Lys515, Arg560, and Leu562 (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). A surprising feature of the crystal structure of the Ca2+-bound E1Ca2 dephospho form is that the configuration of the cytoplasmic domains is quite open with the nucleotide-binding site being separated from Asp351 in domain P by more than 25 Å, implying large domain movements during ATP binding and hydrolysis (1Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). Presumably, the binding of nucleotide leads to closing of the structure. The movements contribute to uncertainties about the nucleotide-binding residues and the orientation of the bound nucleotide. Although the high affinity binding sites for TNP-nucleotide and ATP seem to overlap (6Nakamoto R.K. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2961-2970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), they are not necessarily identical. Thapsigargin, a potent inhibitor of the Ca2+-ATPase, has no effect on TNP-ATP or TNP-8N3-ATP binding, and yet decreases the affinity of the pump for ATP by at least 100-fold (5McIntosh D.B.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 332: 229-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The doubts with respect to the nucleotide site are exacerbated by functional studies showing that ATP in addition to being the phosphorylating substrate exerts modulatory effects on various steps of the pump cycle, see boxed ATP in Scheme 1 (8Verjovski-Almeida S.

In view of the predicted large domain movements and presence of the phosphoryl group at the catalytic site during part of the cycle, it seems unlikely that modulatory ATP binds exactly as substrate ATP does. In the present study, we have introduced mutations of Thr441, Glu442, Lys515, Arg560, Cys561, and Leu562, and we have also extended the previous study (5McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) on mutants with alterations to Phe487, Arg489, and Lys492. With the exception of Cys561, these residues show a high degree of conservation throughout the P-type ATPase family (17Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). A recent study, applying solution nuclear magnetic resonance techniques to a 28-kDa recombinant Ca2+-ATPase fragment corresponding to domain N pinpointed Thr441 and Glu442 as the two residues providing the largest shifts in the backbone15N spectra upon addition of a non-hydrolyzable ATP analogue to the medium (18Abu-Abed M. Tapas K.M. Kainosho M. MacLennan D.H. Ikura M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1156-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Marked spectral shifts were also seen for residues close in the linear sequence to Lys492, Lys515, and Arg560. Site-directed mutagenesis studies have previously shown the importance of Lys515 and Arg560 in the overall ATPase function (19Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Mutation of Lys515 to arginine, alanine, glutamine, and glutamate resulted in 65, 30, 25, and 5% Ca2+-transport activity relative to wild type (19Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 20Maruyama K. Clarke D.M. Fujii J. Inesi G. Loo T.W. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13038-13042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutation of Arg560 to alanine abolished phosphorylation from ATP (21Hua S. Ma H. Lewis D. Inesi G. Toyoshima C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2264-2272Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Thr441, Glu442, Cys561, and Leu562, or their homologues in other P-type ATPases, have not been subjected previously to mutational analysis. This study, presenting the first direct measurements of nucleotide-binding properties of mutants with alterations to Thr441, Glu442, Lys515, Arg560, Cys561, and Leu562 of the Ca2+-ATPase, reveals marked effects on nucleotide binding to the substrate site of the dephosphoenzyme, except in the case of the Cys561 mutants. Moreover, our analysis of other steps in the pump cycle (Scheme 1) demonstrates that phosphorylation, the Ca2+-translocating E1PCa2 → E2P conformational transition, as well as the hydrolysis of the E2P phosphoenzyme intermediate are affected to various extents by the mutations. The low affinity modulatory effects of ATP on the phosphoenzyme-processing steps are, however, not significantly affected. Finally, we provide functional evidence for close interaction between Lys515 and Glu442 in experiments demonstrating direct involvement of Glu442 in the labeling reaction of Lys515 with FITC. Mutagenesis, Expression, and Assays of Overall Function—Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of cDNA encoding the rabbit fast twitch muscle Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1a isoform) was carried out as described previously (22Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For expression, the wild-type or mutant cDNA, inserted in the pMT2 vector (23Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), was transfected into COS-1 cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (24Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4823) Google Scholar). The microsomal fraction containing expressed wild-type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase was isolated by differential centrifugation (19Maruyama K. MacLennan D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3314-3318Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The concentration of expressed Ca2+-ATPase was quantified by a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (25Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16157-16164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by determination of the maximum capacity for phosphorylation by inorganic phosphate in the presence of 30% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (“active site concentration,” see Ref. 26Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transport of45Ca2+ into the microsomal vesicles was measured by filtration, and the ATPase activity was measured by determining the amount of Pi liberated as described previously (26Sørensen T. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP and32Pi—Manual mixing experiments at various buffer and temperature conditions (detailed in the figure legends) were carried out according to the principles described previously (22Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Clarke D.M. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21024-21030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30244-30253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Transient kinetic experiments at 25 °C were performed using a Bio-Logic quench-flow module QFM-5 (Bio-Logic Science Instruments, Claix, France) as described (27Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In all phosphorylation experiments, acid quenching was performed with 0.5–2 volumes of 25% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid containing 100 mm H3PO4. The acid-precipitated protein was washed by centrifugation and subjected to SDS-PAGE in a 7% polyacrylamide gel at pH 6.0 (28Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the radioactivity associated with the separated Ca2+-ATPase band was quantified by imaging, using a Packard Cyclone™ Storage Phosphor System. Background phosphorylation levels, subtracted from all data points, were usually determined in parallel experiments with control microsomes isolated from mock-transfected COS-1 cells. In some of the dephosphorylation experiments, the constant phosphorylation level reached after the exponential decay was taken as background (usually ∼5% of the initial phosphorylation). To remove contaminant ADP and AMP, the non-radioactive ATP added in millimolar concentration in dephosphorylation experiments was purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Sephadex DEAE-A25 column before use. By using an NADH-coupled spectrophotometric assay with phosphoenolpyruvate, lactate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase, the purified ATP preparation was found to contain less ADP than the detection limit of 0.1 mol %. Assays for Nucleotide Binding—The synthesis of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP, the photolabeling of COS-1 cell microsomes containing wild-type or mutant Ca2+-ATPase, the inhibition by ATP, and the quantification of labeled bands by electronic autoradiography following SDS-PAGE were carried out as described previously (5McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 29Seebregts C.J. McIntosh D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2043-2052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Generally, the concentration of [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP was 3× K0.5 in the inhibition experiments with ATP (where K0.5 is ligand concentration giving half-maximum effect). Details of the buffer composition are given in the legends. CrATP-induced Ca2+ occlusion was measured as described previously (5McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 30Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25739-25743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Calculations and Data Analysis—The ion concentrations in the reaction buffers were calculated using the program WEBMAXC, available on the World Wide Web, and the stability constants therein (31Bers D.M. Patton C.W. Nuccitelli R. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 40: 3-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Generally, experiments were conducted at least twice, and the complete set of data was analyzed by nonlinear regression using the SigmaPlot program (SPSS, Inc.). Monoexponential functions were fitted to the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation time courses. The analysis of ligand concentration dependences was based on the Hill equation,[EL]=Etot⋅[L]n/(K0.5n+[L]n) (Eq. 1) For analysis of the [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP labeling data, a constant or linear component was added to represent nonspecific labeling as described (5McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the Hill coefficient was set to 1. The “true” dissociation constant for ATP and MgATP binding was calculated using the previously validated equation for competitive inhibition of the [γ-32P]TNP-8N3-ATP labeling (5McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis and Expression—Nine Ca2+-ATPase constructs with mutations of potential nucleotide-binding residues were prepared in this study. Thr441, Glu442, and Lys515 were replaced individually with alanine. Cys561 was replaced with alanine or tryptophan; Arg560 was replaced with leucine, valine, or glutamate; and Leu562 was replaced with phenylalanine. The latter substitution was chosen to test the importance of the leucine for nucleotide binding by either introducing steric hindrance at this position or possibly enhancing the affinity for nucleotide by creating an aromatic “sandwich” for the adenine ring with Phe487. All mutants could be expressed in COS-1 cells at levels similar to that of the wild type (data not shown), allowing studies of the overall function as well as the partial reactions of the enzyme cycle. In addition, some supplementary studies of partial reactions were carried out with previously constructed mutants (5McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25778-25789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with alterations to Phe487, Arg489, and Lys492. Overview of Functional Effects—Fig. 1A shows ATP-driven 45Ca2+ accumulation in microsomal vesicles measured in the presence of oxalate to trap Ca2+ in the lumen. The MgATP concentration was 5 mm, i.e. several hundredfold higher than required to saturate the phosphorylation reaction in wild type. All the mutants were able to transport Ca2+, albeit at reduced rates compared with wild type. The most significant reduction was seen for mutant Arg560 → Glu with a Ca2+ transport rate corresponding to 17% that of the wild type, whereas ∼80% transport was obtained for the Cys561 mutants. The Ca2+ transport rates of the remaining six mutants were roughly half (39–66%) that of wild type. Fig. 1B shows the ATPase activity in the presence of 5 mm MgATP without oxalate, in the absence and presence of the calcium ionophore A23187. In the absence of ionophore (conditions resulting in net Ca2+ uptake in the vesicles), a similar pattern was obtained for ATP hydrolysis as for Ca2+ transport (Fig. 1B, black columns), Arg560 → Glu showing the most marked reduction of turnover rate, the Cys561 mutants being wild type like, and the remaining six mutants hydrolyzing ATP at turnover rates of 40–58% as compared with wild type. The good correlation between the turnover rate for ATP hydrolysis and ATP-driven accumulation of Ca2+ in the microsomes demonstrates that the coupling between ATP hydrolysis and Ca2+ transport was retained in the mutants. Addition of calcium ionophore A23187 to the reaction medium increased the rate of ATP hydrolysis in the wild type 2–3-fold because of relief of the “back inhibition” of the rate-limiting E1PCa2 → E2P transition imposed by Ca2+ accumulated at high concentrations in the microsomal vesicles. A similar increase was seen for Thr441 → Ala, Glu442 → Ala, Lys515 → Ala, and the Cys561 mutants, whereas for Leu562 → Phe and the three Arg560 mutants the ATPase activity remained essentially unaltered (Fig. 1B, gray columns). The latter result implies that a reaction step other than the E1PCa2 → E2P transition is rate-limiting in the case of Leu562 Phe and Arg560 mutants. In the Ca2+-bound E1Ca2 state, the wild-type Ca2+-ATPase forms a phosphoenzyme intermediate by reaction with MgATP (cf. Scheme 1). Fig. 1C shows the results of experiments where phosphorylation of Ca2+-saturated enzyme was carried out for 5 s at 25 °C with either 5 or 50 μm [γ-32P]MgATP. For wild type, the maximum steady-state phosphoenzyme level of ∼80% of the total active-site concentration is close to being reached at 5 μm MgATP; also for the Cys561 mutants, there was not much difference between 5 and 50 μm MgATP. By contrast, mutants Thr441 → Ala, Glu442 → Ala, Lys515 → Ala, and in particular Arg560 → Leu, Arg560 → Val, and Leu562 → Phe showed much lower phosphoenzyme levels with 5 μm MgATP than with 50 μm MgATP, indicating a markedly reduced apparent affinity for the nucleotide, relative to wild type. Mutant Arg560 → Glu was unable to phosphorylate significantly above the background level at either concentration of MgATP (Fig. 1C). MgATP Dependence and Time Course of Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP—The MgATP concentration dependence of phosphorylation was further investigated at 0 °C, where the ATP hydrolysis rate was sufficiently low to allow the phosphorylation to be studied at submicromolar concentrations of the substrate. As seen in Fig. 2A, a 10–120-fold reduction of apparent affinity for MgATP (increase of K0.5) relative to wild type was found for mutants Thr441 → Ala, Glu442 → Ala, Lys515 → Ala, and Leu562 → Phe; and for mutants Arg560 → Leu and Arg560 → Val, the K0.5 for MgATP was at least 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of wild type. Fig. 2B shows the time course of phosphorylation at 25 °C of wild type and selected mutants determined by quench-flow methodology in the presence of 5 μm [γ-32P]MgATP under conditions identical to those corresponding to Fig. 1C. Leu562 → Phe and the three Arg560 mutants were not included in these studies because their phosphorylation levels were too low to allow reliable pre-steady-state measurements (cf. Fig. 1C). The wild type reaches a steady-state level of phosphorylation within a few hundred milliseconds, with a slight initial over-shoot (Fig. 2B, cf. also Ref. 27Sørensen T.L. Dupont Y. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5400-5408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For simplicity, a monoexponential function was fitted to the data, giving an apparent rate constant kobs = 60 s-1 for the approach to steady state. In comparison, 5–12-fold lower kobs values were determined for mutants Thr441 → Ala, Glu442 → Ala, and Lys515 → Ala (Fig. 2B). The kobs value decreased in the same order as the apparent MgATP affinity observed in Fig. 2A (Glu442 → Ala > Lys515 → Ala > Thr441 → Ala). MgATP Dependence of ATP Hydrolysis—For wild-type Ca2+-ATPase, the MgATP activation profile of ATPase activity has a complex appearance, because MgATP (or ATP) in addition to being the phosphorylating substrate exerts modulatory effects on various steps of the pump cycle, cf. Scheme 1 (8Verjovski-Almeida S. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 18-21Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Shigekawa M. Dougherty J.P. J. Biol.

The basal activation to about 20% of the maximum activity occurring at MgATP concentrations below 10 μm in wild type reflects the binding of MgATP to the E1Ca2 form as phosphorylating substrate. It can be seen in Fig. 3 that for mutant Leu562 → Phe and the three Arg560 mutants, the basal activation was shifted to much higher MgATP concentrations in agreement with the data in Fig. 2A. Less drastic right-shifts of the basal activation were observed for mutants Thr441 → Ala, Glu442 → Ala, and Lys515 → Ala with plateau levels being reached at about 50 μM MgATP, whereas the Cys561 mutants were wild type-like. At least two secondary activation phases occur for the wild-type enzyme, between 10 and 200 μm MgATP and at higher MgATP concentrations, reflecting the accelerating effect of nucleotide on partial reaction steps preceding and subsequent to phosphorylation (9Shigekawa M.

Fig. 3 shows that the Cys561 mutants displayed a wild type-like secondary activation. For mutant Leu562 → Phe and the three Arg560 mutants, the severely reduced ATPase activity prevented a clear distinction between the basal and the intermediate modulatory phases (Fig. 3), but a distinct low affinity activation phase similar to that of the wild type is seen above 200 μm MgATP for Arg560 → Leu, Arg560 → Val, and Leu562 → Phe, as well as for Thr441 → Ala, Glu442 → Ala, and Lys515 → Ala, indicating that nucleotide binding with low affinity accelerates at least one partial reaction in these mutants, although in contrast to the wild type the activation profiles level off above 3 mm MgATP for Thr441 → Ala, Glu442 → Ala, and Lys515 → Ala. Furthermore, taking into consideration that the basal activation is shifted to higher MgATP concentrations relative to wild type, the activation occurring with intermediate affinity, between 10"
https://openalex.org/W2026272867,"Recently an oxygen-sensing/transducing mechanism has been identified as a family of O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes (PHD). In normoxia, PHD hydroxylates a specific proline residue that directs the degradation of constitutively synthesized hypoxia-inducible factor-1α. During hypoxia, the cessation of hydroxylation of this proline results in less degradation and thus increases hypoxia-inducible factor-1α protein levels. In this study we have examined the consequences of activating the PHD oxygen-sensing pathway in cultured neonatal myocytes using ethyl-3,4 dihydroxybenzoate and dimethyloxalylglycine, inhibitors that, similar to hypoxia, inhibit this family of O2-dependent PHD enzymes. Increased glucose uptake and enhanced glycolytic metabolism are classical cellular responses to hypoxia. Ethyl-3,4 dihydroxybenzoate treatment of cardiomyocyte cultures for 24 h increased [3H]deoxy-4-glucose uptake concurrent with an induction of GLUT1 protein. In addition, ethyl-3,4 dihydroxybenzoate, dimethyloxalylglycine, and hypoxia treatments were found to induce protein levels of nitricoxide synthase-2 and heme oxygenase-1, two important cardioregulatory proteins whose expression in response to hypoxic conditions is poorly understood. In conjunction with these changes in gene expression, activation of the PHD oxygen-sensing mechanism was found to preserve myocyte viability in the face of metabolic inhibition with cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose. These results point to a key role for the PHD pathway in the phenotypic changes that are observed in a hypoxic myocyte and may suggest a strategy to pharmacologically induce protection in heart.

In addition, ethyl-3,4 dihydroxybenzoate, dimethyloxalylglycine, and hypoxia treatments were found to induce protein levels of nitricoxide synthase-2 and heme oxygenase-1, two important cardioregulatory proteins whose expression in response to hypoxic conditions is poorly understood. In conjunction with these changes in gene expression, activation of the PHD oxygen-sensing mechanism was found to preserve myocyte viability in the face of metabolic inhibition with cyanide and 2-deoxyglucose. These results point to a key role for the PHD pathway in the phenotypic changes that are observed in a hypoxic myocyte and may suggest a strategy to pharmacologically induce protection in heart. The cardiovascular system displays exquisite sensitivity to oxygen levels with a constellation of both acute and chronic responses to changes in oxygen tension. It is of interest to explore the specific changes in gene expression and the signaling pathways that mediate the response of the heart cell to hypoxia. Recently a family of O2-dependent prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes (PHD) 1The abbreviations used are: PHD, prolyl hydroxylase domain-containing enzymes; HIF-1α, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α; HO-1, heme oxygenase-1; NOS-2, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; HBSS, Hank's balanced salt solution; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; EDHB, ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate; DMOG, dimethyloxalylglycine. have been identified as an oxygen-sensing/transducing pathway (1Bruick R.K.

Hydroxylation of a specific proline in the degradation domain of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) by the PHD enzyme directs its constitutive degradation (3Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W.

In hypoxia, failure of the oxygen-dependent PHD to hydroxylate this proline interrupts the targeting of HIF for proteasomal degradation. In addition, in low oxygen conditions, the failure to hydroxylate an asparagine residue in the transactivating domain of HIF results in an increased transactivating potential (5Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Three mammalian members of this oxygen-dependent prolyl hydroxylase enzyme family (PHD 1, 2, and 3) have been identified to date (1Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar, 2Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A.

Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). Other possible cellular targets of these prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylase enzymes, beside HIF, remain unidentified. The expression of many genes is induced or modulated in response to hypoxia. A well characterized example of a hypoxia-inducible gene is Glut1. In the case of GLUT1, its induction by hypoxia occurs mostly at the transcriptional level through an HIF-dependent mechanism (6Behrooz A. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5555-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 7Behrooz A. Ismail-Beigi F. News Physiol. Sci. 1999; 14: 105-110PubMed Google Scholar). Like GLUT1, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been characterized as a hypoxia-inducible gene in cardiomyocyte cells (8Borger D.R. Essig D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H965-H973PubMed Google Scholar). HO-1 is a stress-responsive protein that has recently been shown to ameliorate the damage sustained by the heart from an ischemia-reperfusion insult (9Hangaishi M. Ishizaka N. Aizawa T. Kurihara Y. Taguchi J. Nagai R. Kimura S. Ohno M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 279: 582-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 10Clark J.E. Foresti R. Sarathchandra P. Kaur H. Green C.J. Motterlini R. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: H643-H651Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inducible nitric-oxide synthase (NOS-2) is another important cardioregulatory protein whose expression is thought to be regulated by oxygen tension. The induction of NOS-2 expression after an ischemic insult has been postulated to underlie the phenomenon of delayed ischemic preconditioning (11Bolli R. Manchikalapudi S. Tang X.L. Takano H. Qiu Y. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Jadoon A.K. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1094-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). NOS-2 induction by cytokines is modulated by oxygen tension (12Kacimi R. Long C.S. Karliner J.S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Jung F. Palmer L.A. Zhou N. Johns R.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However the ability of hypoxia, per se, to induce NOS-2 protein expression is unclear. In this study we have employed specific inhibitors of the prolyl hydroxylase class of enzymes to activate the PHD oxygen-sensing pathway in cardiomyocytes to explore which responses in the ischemic heart might be attributable to this oxygen-sensing mechanism. Because the expression of GLUT1, HO-1, and NOS-2 has been suggested to be modulated by hypoxia and/or HIF, we examined whether the pharmacological activation of the PHD enzyme oxygen-sensing pathway would effect the expression of these genes. We found that prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors lead to the induction of GLUT1, HO-1, and NOS-2 proteins in heart cells. Further experimentation revealed that a phenotype resistant to metabolic insult accompanied these changes in gene expression. These results point to a central role for the PHD oxygen-sensing mechanism in the response of the heart to hypoxia. Myocyte Cultures—Primary neonatal cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1- to 2-day-old CD-1 mouse pups using a previously described (14Wright G. Singh I.S. Hasday J.D. Farrance I.K. Hall G. Cross A.S. Rogers T.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: H872-H879PubMed Google Scholar) method that produces cultures that exhibit spontaneous beating and >95% myocyte purity. Cells were plated on gelatin-coated plates at a density of 2 × 106 cells per 60 mm diameter culture dish, in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. After 16 h myocytes were washed and placed in maintenance media consisting of DMEM/F12 supplemented with insulin/transferrin/selenium solution (ITS+2) (Sigma) and 1% fetal calf serum. All experiments were conducted on days 3–5 after isolation of the myocytes. To achieve hypoxia, cultures were placed in an airtight Plexiglas chamber that was vigorously purged (10 min) and then continuously perfused with 95/5% argon/CO2 gas mixture (∼400 cm3 per min). Glucose Uptake Assay—Glucose uptake was assayed by placing cultures, treated as indicated, in Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 2 μCi [3H]2-deoxyglucose and 10 μm cold 2-deoxyglucose, ± cytochalasin B (50 μm) for 10 min at room temperature. Uptake that was not inhibited by cytochalasin did not exceed 10% of total and was subtracted from values as nonspecific background. Cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cells were lysed directly on plates with 0.05 m NaOH. Extracts were counted via scintillation. Parallel non-radiolabeled cultures treated as above were harvested for protein determinations. Western Blots—Western blot analysis was performed by standard procedures using SDS-PAGE Tris/glycine pre-cast gels in the NOVEX electrophoresis system. Western blot analyses were performed and detected using ECL chemiluminescence detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and protocols. Antibodies directed against GLUT1 (Alpha Diagnostic, San Antonio, TX), NOS-2 (Santa Cruz), HO-1 (Santa Cruz), phospho-ERK1&2 (Promega, Madison, WI), and Grp75 (StressGen, Victoria, BC, Canada) were purchased from commercial vendors. Real-time PCR—Quantitative real-time PCR of NOS-2 mRNA was performed using primers 5′-TGGACAAGCTGCACGTGACT and 3′-TCCACTGCCCCAGTTTTTG. First strand synthesis was conducted for 60 min at 48 °C in a 10 μl reaction containing 100 ng total RNA, 5.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 μm random hexamer primers, 2 μm dNTPs, 4 units of Rnase inhibitor, and 12.5 units of murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. The real-time PCR reaction consisted of the first strand synthesis reaction, to which was added 4 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm dNTPs, 1× SYBR Green PCR buffer (PE Biosystems), 0.4 μm NOS-2 forward and reverse primers, and 2.5 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (PE Biosystems). The reaction was monitored using an Applied Biosystems PRISM 7700 detection system. Final reaction products were run on a 2% agarose gel and confirmed to be a single band at the correct molecular weight. Metabolic Inhibition and Cell Viability—For metabolic inhibition experiments cultures were placed in glucose-free DMEM medium (containing 2 mm potassium cyanide and 100 mg/liter 2-deoxyglucose) and incubated at 37 °C in a cell culture incubator with a 95/5% air/CO2 atmosphere for 260 min. To assay viability, cells were placed in HBSS containing 0.1% trypan blue for 10 min, and washed twice with HBSS. The myocytes were fixed in a 4% paraformaldehyde phosphate-buffered saline solution and examined using a phase contrast microscope equipped with a digital camera. As a second measure of viability cells were trypsinized and placed in suspension of glucose-free DMEM containing 10 μg/ml propidium iodide. Ten thousand cells per sample were analyzed (excitation 488 nm, emission 650 nm) using a BD Biosciences FACSort equipped with CellQuest software. Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors—The PHD inhibitor ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (EDHB) was purchased from Sigma. Dimethyloxalylglycine was synthesized according to a previously published method (15Tschank G. Brocks D.G. Engelbart K. Mohr J. Baader E. Gunzler V. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 16Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibition Increases Glucose Uptake and GLUT1 Protein—An increase in glucose uptake and utilization is a classic cellular response to hypoxia or ischemia. Cardiomyocyte cultures were treated with the prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor EDHB to examine the potential up-regulation of glucose uptake by PHD pathway activation. EDHB has been characterized as a specific cell-permeable inhibitor that competitively binds to both the ascorbate- and α-ketoglutarate-binding sites of the prolyl hydroxylase active domain (17Sasaki T. Majamaa K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9397-9403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Majamaa K. Gunzler V. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Myllyla R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7819-7823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The half-maximal effective concentrations of EDHB for the inhibition of prolyl hydroxylase activity in intact cell preparations was reported as ∼250 μm (17Sasaki T. Majamaa K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9397-9403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]2-deoxyglucose uptake by neonatal myocytes cultured in serum-free medium and treated with EDHB or insulin for 16 h was significantly increased over basal ∼8.5- and ∼2.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 1A). Hypoxia is known to increase glucose uptake by the transcriptional activation of the HIF-responsive GLUT1 gene (6Behrooz A. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5555-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus it is likely that increased expression of GLUT1 transporter protein underlies the stimulation of glucose uptake by EDHB. EDHB-treated cultures were found to have increased GLUT1 protein levels as assessed by Western blot analysis, confirming the induction of the hypoxic-responsive GLUT1 gene (Fig. 1B). Heme Oxygenase-1 Protein Is Elevated in Response to Activation of the Prolyl Hydroxylase Oxygen-sensing Pathway— HO-1 is a stress-induced cardioregulatory protein that has previously been shown to be induced by hypoxia in neonatal cardiomyocytes (8Borger D.R. Essig D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H965-H973PubMed Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to explore the possibility that the induction of HO-1 by hypoxia can be attributed to the activation of the PHD oxygen sensor. EDHB treatment of cardiomyocyte cultures (Fig. 2A) was found to dose-dependently induce HO-1 protein levels using concentrations previously reported to be effective at inhibiting prolyl hydroxylase enzyme activity in intact cell preparations (17Sasaki T. Majamaa K. Uitto J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9397-9403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two other potential stress responsive proteins, mitochondrial Grp 75 and ERK phospho-kinases, were found to be largely unaffected by EHDB treatment (Fig. 2A), suggesting that HO-1 induction cannot be attributed to a generalized stress response. The induction of HO-1 by prolyl hydroxylase inhibition was confirmed using the PHD inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG). As with EDHB, DMOG induced HO-1 protein levels at doses consistent with those reported to inhibit PHD enzymes in intact cell preparations (15Tschank G. Brocks D.G. Engelbart K. Mohr J. Baader E. Gunzler V. Hanauske-Abel H.M. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 469-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), with discernable HO-1 induction occurring at 5 μm (Fig. 2B). Nitric-oxide Synthase-2 mRNA and Protein Is Elevated in Response to Activation of the Prolyl Hydroxylase Oxygen Sensor—NOS-2 is expressed in heart after an ischemic insult (19Wang Y. Guo Y. Zhang S.X. Wu W.J. Wang J. Bao W. Bolli R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 5-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and during systemic hypoxia (20Rouet-Benzineb P. Eddahibi S. Raffestin B. Laplace M. Depond S. Adnot S. Crozatier B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1697-1708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), however it remains unclear whether hypoxia, per se, is sufficient for inducing NOS-2 protein expression. Having shown that PHD inhibitors induced two hypoxia-inducible genes, GLUT1 and HO-1, it was of interest to examine their effects on NOS-2 expression. Transcriptional activation of the NOS-2 gene in cardiomyocyte cultures was observed with EDHB (500 μm) treatment, as reflected in the robust (>100-fold) and early (within 6 h) increase in NOS-2 mRNA levels measured with quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 3). The induction of NOS-2 mRNA was also reflected at the level of protein, with a dose-dependent appearance of NOS-2 protein detected (Fig. 4A). DMOG was also found to induce NOS-2 protein levels (Fig. 4B) at the same concentrations found to induce HO-1 and consistent with the doses necessary to inhibit prolyl hydroxylases.Fig. 4Prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors increase NOS-2 protein levels. Western blot analysis of NOS-2 in extracts from cardiomyocytes treated with the indicated concentrations of EDHB (A) and DMOG (B) for 20 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Hypoxic Culture Conditions Induce HO-1 and NOS-2 Proteins in Neonatal Cardiomyocyte Cultures—Having shown that the pharmacological activation of the PHD oxygen-sensing pathway was sufficient to induce expression of HO-1 and NOS-2, it was important to examine the effect of genuine hypoxia on their expression levels. To confirm that HO-1 and NOS-2 are induced by hypoxia, cardiomyocyte cultures were placed in hypoxic culture conditions for 20 h and Western analysis of HO-1 and NOS-2 protein levels was performed. Both HO-1 and NOS-2 proteins levels were found to be induced by hypoxic culture conditions (Fig. 5) Pharmacological Activation of the Oxygen Sensor Confers a Protected Phenotype on Cardiomyocytes—To examine the hypothesis that the changes in gene expression induced by the hypoxic sensor represent a coordinated compensatory program whose goal is to preserve myocyte viability in conditions of low oxygen (and hence low aerobic metabolism), the viability of myocytes following metabolic inhibition-stress was assessed in cultures ± PHD inhibitor treatment. Activation of the O2-sensing pathway for 16 h prior to 260 min of metabolic inhibition significantly improved cell viability. After metabolic inhibition, the percentage of cells pretreated with vehicle, EDHB, or DMOG that stained positive for trypan blue was 97.2 ± 1.5%, 22.4 ± 3.1%, and 14.6 ± 4.5%, respectively. (Fig. 6A). The protective effect of PHD inhibitor treatment was confirmed in DMOG-pretreated cultures using propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry (Fig. 6B). This study has examined the consequences of pharmacological activation of the PHD oxygen-sensing pathway in cardiomyocytes. Activation of the oxygen sensor with inhibitors of the PHD enzymes was found to induce GLUT1, HO-1, and NOS-2 proteins. In the case of NOS-2 protein these studies are, to our knowledge, the first to provide evidence that hypoxia and the activation of the PHD oxygen sensor are sufficient to cause NOS-2 protein induction. Taken together these results suggest a prominent role for the PHD oxygen sensor in the physiology and stress responses of the heart cell. Recently, a family of oxygen-dependent prolyl 4-hydroxylase enzymes has been identified as a cellular oxygen-sensing and -transducing mechanism. It was found that a specific post-translational hydroxylation of proline 564 of HIF-1α stabilizes its interaction with von Hippel-Lindau, a protein that targets proteins for degradation by the proteasome. In low oxygen conditions, where PHD activity is inhibited, proline 564 is not hydroxylated, thus the interaction of HIF and von Hippel-Lindau proteins ceases and leads to the interruption of HIF-1α degradation (3Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Science. 2001; 292: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar, 4Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M.

Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar). In Caenorhabditis elegans, this prolyl hydroxylation is achieved by the protein EGL-9, a prolyl 4-hydroxylase that is a member of the family of enzymes known to stabilize collagen helix formation via proline hydroxylation (2Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W.

Rep. 2002; 19: 49-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Three mammalian prolyl hydroxylase-domain-containing proteins (PHD 1, 2, and 3) have been identified and characterized as oxygen-sensing enzymes (2Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Cell. 2001; 107: 43-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2749) Google Scholar). This family of PHD enzymes depends upon the cofactors Fe2+, α-ketoglutarate, and ascorbate for hydroxylating activity (22Kivirikko K.I. Myllyla R. Pihlajaniemi T. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 1609-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). EDHB and DMOG are known to inhibit prolyl hydroxylation in C. elegans (16Friedman L. Higgin J.J. Moulder G. Barstead R. Raines R.T. Kimble J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4736-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition to prolyl hydroxylation as a regulator HIF-1α stability, it has also recently been shown that an oxygen-dependent asparaginyl hydroxylase regulates the transactivating domain of HIF (5Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar, 23Lando D. Peet D.J. Gorman J.J. Whelan D.A. Whitelaw M.L. Bruick R.K. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1466-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). Abrogation of Asn-803 hydroxylation of HIF-1α by hypoxia leads to an increase in its affinity for the p300 co-transcriptional activator, and in this manner achieves increased transactivation. Besides HIF, other targets of this prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylase oxygen-sensor family have not yet been identified. In this study we have employed several pharmacological agents that mimic hypoxia in that they inhibit the activity of members of this family of prolyl hydroxylase enzymes and activate this hypoxic-sensing transduction pathway. The pharmacological activation of this oxygen-sensing pathway has allowed us to begin to explore the down stream effectors whose induction may be important to the response of the cardiomyocyte to ischemia and hypoxia. The most well characterized cellular response to lower oxygen is to increase glycolytic metabolism. Glucose transporter, GLUT1, as well as other glycolytic enzymes are hypoxia-inducible genes (24Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 588-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). In the case of GLUT1, its induction by hypoxia occurs mostly at the transcriptional level through an HIF-dependent mechanism (6Behrooz A. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5555-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The elevation of GLUT1 levels in response to oxygen-limited conditions represents an important compensatory mechanism that allows for increased glycolytic metabolism to maintain ATP production. These studies show that, consistent with the activation of the cellular oxygen-sensing mechanism, PHD inhibitors induce expression of GLUT1 and enhance glucose uptake. Interestingly, a recent study (25Liao R. Jain M. Cui L. D'Agostino J. Aiello F. Luptak I. Ngoy S. Mortensen R.M. Tian R. Circulation. 2002; 106: 2125-2131Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) has found that GLUT1 overexpression protects the heart from pressure overload-induced failure. Heme oxygenase-1 (also known as HSP32) is a stress-induced cardioregulatory protein previously shown (8Borger D.R. Essig D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H965-H973PubMed Google Scholar) to be induced by hypoxia in cardiomyocytes. HO-1 catalyzes the rate-limiting reaction in heme catabolism, yielding biliverdin, carbon monoxide, and iron as byproducts. There is an increasing appreciation of the potent biological and protective roles that HO-1 exerts though the production of these byproducts (26Morse D. Choi A.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 27: 8-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Although the HO-1 gene contains an HIF-binding site (27Lee P.J. Jiang B.H. Chin B.Y. Iyer N.V. Alam J. Semenza G.L. Choi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5375-5381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar), the functional significance of HIF in the induction of HO-1 in response to hypoxia has been questioned by several studies (28Alam J. Camhi S. Choi A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11977-11984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 29Eyssen-Hernandez R. Ladoux A. Frelin C.

Chem. 2001; 276: 27018-27025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our studies have established that hypoxia induces HO-1 in cardiomyocytes and have also implicated the PHD oxygen sensor as the mediator of this response. NOS-2 is expressed in heart in vivo during chronic hypoxia and after an ischemic insult. It has been attributed a central protective role in the delayed phase of myocardial ischemic preconditioning (11Bolli R. Manchikalapudi S. Tang X.L. Takano H. Qiu Y. Guo Y. Zhang Q. Jadoon A.K. Circ. Res. 1997; 81: 1094-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Recently endogenous nitric-oxide production has also been linked to myocardial hibernation phenotype in chronically ischemic heart cells (31Kalra D.K. Zhu X. Ramchandani M.K. Lawrie G. Reardon M.J. Lee-Jackson D. Winters W.L. Sivasubramanian N. Mann D.L. Zoghbi W.A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 1537-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Heusch G. Post H. Michel M.C. Kelm M. Schulz R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Oxygen concentration appears to play a significant role in modulating NOS-2 induction in heart. The NOS-2 promoter has binding sites for transcription factors that are potentially regulated by hypoxia and oxygen stress (33Xie Q.W. Whisnant R. Nathan C. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1779-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar, 34Melillo G. Musso T. Sica A. Taylor L.S. Cox G.W. Varesio L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1683-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). These include NF-κB, AP-1, and HIF-1 cis elements. Additionally, the NOS-2 promoter is transcriptionally activated by hypoxia in macrophages and cardiomyocytes (13Jung F. Palmer L.A. Zhou N. Johns R.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 34Melillo G. Musso T. Sica A. Taylor L.S. Cox G.W. Varesio L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1683-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). However it remains unclear whether hypoxia, per se, is sufficient for the induction of NOS-2 protein levels (12Kacimi R. Long C.S. Karliner J.S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 1937-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Jung F. Palmer L.A. Zhou N. Johns R.A. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Our studies clearly demonstrate that hypoxia, and activation of the PHD oxygen sensor, are sufficient for the induction of NOS-2 protein. Thus the contribution of this O2-sensing signaling mechanism for the increased expression of NOS-2 under a variety of pathological cardiac conditions is likely to be significant. These findings may also suggest a potential role for the PHD O2-sensing mechanism in mediating the responses of heart tissue to an oxygen deficit (i.e. delayed preconditioning, hibernation). The changes in gene expression that are effected by PHD pathway activation are likely to represent a coordinated compensatory response of the cardiomyocyte to ischemic stress. In support of this contention we have found that the pharmacological activation of this PHD oxygen-sensing mechanism significantly reduces loss of cellular viability when heart cells are treated with metabolic inhibitors. In this context the changes that we have documented to occur in response to PHD inhibitors (i.e. induction of NOS-2, HO-1, and GLUT1) may reflect a broad shift of the heart cells to a cardioprotective phenotype. The pharmacological activation of the PHD oxygen-sensing transduction pathway results in the induction of GLUT1, HO-1, and NOS-2. Because all of these proteins have been implicated to have cardioprotective properties, these findings may suggest a strategy to pharmacologically confer a protected phenotype to heart without the necessity of an ischemic insult. These results also establish that inhibition of PHD activity is sufficient for the induction of NOS-2 and HO-1 proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1988532766,"The Sec1-Munc18 (SM) proteins are required for cellular exocytosis, but their mechanistic function remains poorly understood. We examined SM-syntaxin complexes in human platelets, which are terminally differentiated, anuclear cells that secrete the contents of their intracellular granules through syntaxin 2- and syntaxin 4-dependent mechanisms. Munc18a, Munc18b, and Munc18c were detected in human platelets by immunoblotting and/or PCR. The SM proteins and syntaxin 2 were found in the membrane and cytosolic fractions of cells, whereas syntaxin 4 was detected only in the membrane. Platelet membranes contain Munc18c-syntaxin 4 complexes, but minimal if any Munc18c-syntaxin 2 complexes were found. No significant amounts of Munc18a or Munc18b complexes were seen with either syntaxin. Munc18c-syntaxin 4 complexes were dissociated when cells were activated to secrete. Two potential inhibitors of Munc18c-syntaxin 4 complexes were generated to examine whether complex dissociation may lead to exocytosis. Peptides that mimic the projected intermolecular contact sites of Munc18c with syntaxin enhanced Ca2+-triggered dense granule exocytosis in permeabilized cells. Similarly, an anti-Munc18c monoclonal antibody that inhibited the Munc18c-syntaxin complex potently amplified Ca2+-induced platelet granule secretion. In summary, Munc18 proteins bind to specific syntaxin isoforms in platelets despite the presence of other potential binding partners. Acute inhibition of the SM-syntaxin complex promotes Ca2+-induced exocytosis, suggesting that complex formation per se has a regulatory effect on triggered secretion.

The Sec1-Munc18 (SM) 1The abbreviations are: SM, Sec1-Munc18; PGI2, prostaglandin I2; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; r-Munc18c, recombinant Munc18c; SNAP, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein; SNAP-23, synaptosome-associated protein-23; SNARE, SNAP receptor; mAb, monoclonal antibody; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethane-sulfonic acid. proteins are a conserved family of ∼65-kDa molecules that play a central but still enigmatic role in exocytosis in yeast, neurons, and specialized secretory cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Indeed, all types of intracellular trafficking appear to require both the SM proteins and SNAP receptors (SNAREs) (2Matos M.F. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Three SM proteins have been identified in mammals: a neuronal form, Munc18a (Munc18-1), and two nonneuronal forms, Munc18b (18-2) and Munc18c (18-3, or platelet Sec1 protein) (3Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Munc18a was originally identified in neurons by virtue of its binding to the SNARE protein syntaxin 1 (4Hata Y. Slaughter C.A. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The original identification of different Munc18 genes suggested that unique Munc18-syntaxin interactions may play an important role in regulating the specificity of vesicle trafficking in cells, but more recent in vitro studies have suggested that interactions between these molecules are somewhat promiscuous (5Hata Y. Sudhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13022-13028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 6Tellam J.T. McIntosh S. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5857-5863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Munc18a expression is detected in early stem cells before syntaxin expression, and genetic ablation leads to embryonic lethality (7Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 8Ivanova N.B. Dimos J.T. Schaniel C. Hackney J.A. Moore K.A. Lemischka I.R. Science. 2002; 298: 601-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (1238) Google Scholar). Embryonic neurons lacking Munc18a contain synaptic vesicles but are incapable of exocytosis, indicating that this SM protein is required for membrane fusion (7Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). The SM proteins interact with at least three classes of proteins, but the interaction that mediates their essential role in exocytosis is unknown (7Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Early studies suggested that Munc18 inhibits exocytosis by binding to monomeric syntaxin molecules to block SNARE complex formation (9Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In contrast to Munc18, yeast Sec1p binds to already assembled SNARE complexes, indicating that Sec1p may function after SNARE complex formation (10Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Moreover, SM proteins appear to localize at sites of yeast vacuole fusion (11Wang L. Seeley E.S. Wickner W. Merz A.J. Cell. 2002; 108: 357-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or secretion (12Grote E. Carr C.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Experimental studies using genetic techniques have yielded contradictory results; overexpression of SM proteins has been shown to inhibit, as well as to stimulate, cellular exocytosis (13Schulze K.L.

Mutations in SM proteins also can either enhance or inhibit membrane fusion (reviewed in Ref. 19Bracher A. Perrakis A. Dresbach T. Betz H. Weissenhorn W. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 685-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These contradictory results may be due in part to the fact that alterations in Munc18 expression and/or structure may, over hours to days, influence the level of syntaxin or other secretory molecules in cells (7Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Sudhof T.C.

Yeast. 2001; 18: 1525-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Indeed, SM proteins may act as chaperone-like molecules that deliver newly synthesized syntaxins to appropriate membrane sites (21Peng R. Gallwitz D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 645-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Finally, the stage of exocytosis at which the SM proteins act has yet to be clarified. In mouse chromaffin cells, Munc18 appear to function upstream of SNARE complex formation by promoting the docking of large dense core vesicles with the plasma membrane (18Voets T. Toonen R.F. Brian E.C. de Wit H. Moser T. Rettig J. Sudhof T.C. Neher E. Verhage M. Neuron. 2001; 31: 581-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), but this is not seen in neurons at brain synapses (7Verhage M. Maia A.S. Plomp J.J. Brussaard A.B. Heeroma J.H. Vermeer H. Toonen R.F. Hammer R.E. van den Berg T.K. Missler M. Geuze H.J. Sudhof T.C. Science. 2000; 287: 864-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Taken together, genetic manipulation studies suggest that the SM proteins may have complex roles at several stages in vesicle trafficking (1Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Although structurally homologous, the Sec1 and Munc18 proteins display unanticipated differences in binding sites and function. In yeast, the Sec1 proteins appear to bind SNARE complexes via a short peptide motif in a manner that does not interfere with SNARE complex formation (10Carr C.M. Grote E. Munson M. Hughson F.M. Novick P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 22Yamaguchi T. Dulubova I. Min S.W. Chen X. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Dev.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 3620-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mammalian Munc18 proteins bind with high affinity to a closed confirmation of syntaxin via several intermolecular contact sites in two domains in a manner that should prevent SNARE complex formation (24Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 25Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernandez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that the SM proteins, by virtue of different interacting partners and different binding specificities, may not have the same primary role in vesicle trafficking and exocytosis in all cell types (1Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Despite growing insights, the functional role of the SM-syntaxin interactions in regulated cellular secretion remains unclear from previous studies (1Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 641-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). This study used human platelets as a model system to examine the expression of SM proteins, the specificity of their interactions with the syntaxins, and the effect of syntaxin-SM complex formation on exocytosis. Because platelets are anuclear secretory cells that have almost no Golgi apparatus, they are well suited for examining the terminal phases of regulated exocytosis without the potential confounding effects of biosynthetic processes or vesicle trafficking (26Reed G.L. Fitzgerald M.L. Polgar J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3334-3342PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets contain three types of specialized secretory organelles: α granules, dense granules, and secretory lysosomes (26Reed G.L. Fitzgerald M.L. Polgar J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3334-3342PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have established that platelet exocytosis occurs through formation of SNARE complexes among proteins from three gene families: SNAP-23, vesicle-associated membrane proteins, and syntaxin 2 or 4 (3Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Reed G.L. Fitzgerald M.L. Polgar J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3334-3342PubMed Google Scholar, 27Flaumenhaft R. Croce K.

In these studies, we sought to identify the full complement of SM proteins in platelets and then to determine the specificity of their interactions with the syntaxins required for granule secretion. Anti-Munc18c monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated that inhibit the SM-syntaxin complex in order to determine the acute effects of this complex on platelet granule secretion. Taken together, our results indicate that SM proteins selectively interact with specific syntaxins in platelets and through these interactions play a critical role in platelet exocytosis. Antibody Production—Female BALB/c mice (Charles River) were immunized intraperitoneally with 50 μg of recombinant Munc18c (r-Munc18c) in complete Freund's adjuvant. They were subsequently boosted twice at 2–3-week intervals. The antibody titer was determined by solid phase radioimmunoassay 2 weeks after the final boost. The mice with the highest titers were hyperimmunized with r-Munc18c (5 μg intravenously and 10 μg intraperitoneally) 4 days prior to fusion. Somatic cell fusion was performed as described (34Reed G.L.D. Matsueda G.R. Haber E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1114-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and the fusion frequency was 50%. Hybridoma supernatants were tested for the production of anti-Munc18c mAbs by solid phase radioimmunoassay. Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with 50 μl of r-Munc18c (10 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, and nonspecific protein binding was blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Hybridoma supernatants (50 μl) were added to the wells for 1 h. After washing, bound antibody was detected by 125I-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and counted in 300 μl of Econoscint II by a TOP Count NXT Packard counter. Hybridomas were cloned by limiting dilution and serotyped by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Polyclonal antibodies directed against a peptide corresponding to residues 269–277 of Munc18c, r-Munc18c, recombinant syntaxin 4 (35Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar), or recombinant syntaxin 2 (amino acids 1–262) were generated as described (3Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Fitzgerald M.L. Blood. 1999; 93: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were obtained that were directed against the COOH-terminal peptide sequence unique to Munc18a (Synaptic Systems) or to a peptide sequence shared by Munc18a and Munc18b (Affinity Bioreagents). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 2275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Solubilized human platelet membranes (typically 50 μl; see below) were precleared by incubating with rat anti-mouse κ chain or protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C and centrifugation. The supernatants were incubated with murine mAbs or rabbit polyclonal antibody immobilized on anti-mouse κ chain or protein A-Sepharose beads, respectively (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% (w/w) Nonidet P-40, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm sodium fluoride, 100 units/ml aprotinin, pH 7.2). Immunoprecipitated proteins were solubilized in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, the immunoblotting was performed with the indicated antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected by an enhanced chemifluorescence method (Pierce) and quantitated by an Amersham Biosciences Storm 840 under conditions in which there was a linear relationship between intensity and pixel number as described (28Chung S.H. Polgar J. Reed G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 2275: 25286-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Isolation of Platelet Cytosol and Membranes—Citrated pooled human platelet-rich plasma (with 1 mm EDTA; Massachusetts General Hospital Blood Bank) was centrifuged at 200 × g for 20 min at 21 °C to remove aggregates and red blood cells. Platelets were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 20 min. The platelet pellet was suspended in 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 4.8 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.35% bovine serum albumin with 1 mm EDTA. Platelets were sonicated in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm sodium vanadate, and 5 mm sodium fluoride with a Branson 450 Sonifier (large tip, output 6, 50% duty) briefly at room temperature (30 s × 2) and then on ice (30 s × 2). Large aggregates and unlysed cells were removed by centrifugation in a Sorvall H600A rotor at 4500 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The sonicate was centrifuged in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 28,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C to separate cytosol (supernatant) from platelet membranes. Membranes were dissolved in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2% Triton-X100, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 50 mm sodium vanadate, 100 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor for 30 min, the supernatants were used for co-immunoprecipitation. PCR—Recombinant human Munc18c fragments comprising domain 1 (amino acids 1–134) or domains 2 and 3 (amino acids 135–592) were generated by PCR. Both strands of the DNA were sequenced and ligated into pBK-CMV vector. Human Munc18b was amplified from human platelet cDNA using standard techniques as described (33Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primers mimicked sequences unique to Munc18b: 5′-GAGATTCACCTTGCCTTCCTCC and 5′-TTTGATGTTCGCCTTGTCCG. Binding Assays—A coupled transcription and translation reaction was performed with a T3 primer in reticulocyte lysate using [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Life Sciences) as described by the manufacturer (Promega). The labeled Munc18c domains were purified on a G25 column (Roche Applied Science) and used in a binding assay. Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with goat anti-mouse antibody (2 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C, and nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked with 1% albumin in Tris-buffered saline. Culture supernatants containing mAb 889 or an anti-digoxin mAb of the same isotype (control) were added to the wells for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, the labeled Munc18c domain 1 or domains 2 and 3 fragments were added to the wells (200,000 cpm/50 μl) for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, the wells were counted to determine the amount of bound Munc18c domains. Specific binding for each fragment was determined by subtracting the background binding to the anti-digoxin mAb (negative control). The effects of mAbs on syntaxin 4-Munc18c binding were examined in a similar fashion. Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with syntaxin 4 mAb (5 μg/ml). After nonspecific binding sites were blocked (0.2% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20) for 30 min, platelet membranes were added (50 μl, diluted 1:3 in PBS, 3 h). After washing, [35S]Munc18c was added to the wells in the presence of various concentrations of purified mAbs. After a 40-min incubation, wells were washed and counted and the percent binding was determined by reference to wells containing no inhibitor (0% inhibition) or wells containing saturating amounts of inhibitor (10 μg/ml affinity-purified polyclonal anti-Munc18c antibodies, 100% inhibition). The direct binding of mAbs to r-Munc18c was examined in a capture tag assay. Wells of a microtiter plate were coated with purified mAbs (10 μg/ml), and then nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. Purified r-Munc18c (10 μg/ml) was added to wells for 1 h, and the wells were washed. Bound r-Munc18c was detected by the addition of 125I-labeled polyclonal anti-Munc18c antibodies (100,000 cpm/well) followed by washing and scintillation counting. Cell Permeabilization and Secretion Assays—Human platelet-rich plasma was prepared from freshly drawn blood, and platelet dense granules were loaded with [14C]serotonin as described previously (33Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelets were centrifuged at 1500 × g for 8 min, the supernatant was carefully removed, and the cells were resuspended in a Ca2+-buffering solution containing 20 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm glucose, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.05% bovine serum albumin (buffer A). The platelet count was adjusted to 8 × 108/ml with buffer A. Streptolysin O (Sigma) was dissolved in buffer A at a concentration of 25,000 units/ml, reduced with 2 mm dithiothreitol at 4 °C for 30 min, aliquoted, and stored at -70 °C. Platelet suspensions (20 μl) in 1.5-ml plastic tubes were mixed with 25 μl of buffer A containing various agents and 200–400 units/ml streptolysin O. The samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min and on ice for 30 min. Then ATP (5 μl, 50 mm) and magnesium diacetate (125 mm) in buffer A was added, and the samples were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min. Granule secretion was induced by increasing the free calcium ion concentration (0.1–10 μm as indicated) by adding 2.5–10 μl of CaCl2 in buffer A. The free calcium ion concentration was determined by the calcium ion titration curves described by Knight and Scrutton (36Knight D.E. Scrutton M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 221: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). After a 5-min incubation, 2-μl samples were taken and used for the measurement of P-selectin expression as described below. The remaining samples were put on ice for 3 min and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were used for scintillation counting of [14C]serotonin to assess dense granule secretion. Supernatants were also used to examine lysosomal secretion by measurement of hexosaminidase (37Holmsen H. Dangelmaier C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 169: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In brief, platelet samples (20 μl) were added to a hexosaminidase assay mixture (100 μl) containing 7 volumes of citrate-phosphate buffer (pH 4.5), 2 volumes of a saturated solution of p-nitrophenyl-N-acetyl-β-d-glucoseaminide, and 1 volume of 0.4% Triton X-100. The samples were incubated at 37 °C in an incubator for 12–15 h. Then 0.08 m NaOH (100 μl) was added, and the absorbance of the solution was measured at 405 nm. α granule secretion was monitored by measuring P-selectin expression with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-CD62 antibody AC1.2 (Becton Dickinson) and flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, Becton Dickinson) essentially as described (38Michelson A.D. Shattil S.J. Watson S.P. Authi K.S. Platelets: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, New York1996: 111-129Google Scholar). Peptides—Peptides were synthesized (Sigma) that mimic the sequences of Munc18c that interact with syntaxin as deduced from the crystal structure of the syntaxin 1-Munc18a complex: domain 1, TKLLASCCKMT; domain 1, LEEGITVVENIYKNREPVRQM; domain 3, DNDTYKYKTDGKEKEAI and KKMPHFR (24Misura K.M. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). All peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography. The effects of peptides on the binding of [35S]Munc18c to glutathione S-transferase-syntaxin 4 or glutathione S-transferase-LRP4 (negative control) were examined in a microtiter plate assay as described under “Binding Assays.” In some experiments, peptides were predigested by proteinase K, which was then heat-denatured as described (33Polgar J. Reed G.L. Blood. 1999; 94: 1313-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Statistics—The significance of differences between paired samples was assessed by the Student's t test. Differences between multiple groups were examined by analysis of variance employing the Bonferroni-Dunn correction for multiple statistical inferences. p values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. SM Proteins in Human Platelets—The expression of Munc18 proteins in human platelets was examined by immunoblotting. An anti-Munc18c polyclonal antibody readily detected Munc18c in human platelets, but minimal amounts were found in human brain (Fig. 1B), despite comparable amounts of total protein in each sample as detected by Coomassie staining (Fig. 1A). Munc18c was also detected in human platelets by an antibody raised to a unique peptide sequence in that protein (not shown). Munc18a was readily detected in protein extracts from human brain by a polyclonal antibody generated against a peptide sequence unique to that Munc18 protein (Fig. 1C). Lesser amounts of Munc18a were detected in protein extracts from human platelets (Fig. 1C). No polyclonal antibody existed that was unique for Munc18b, but a polyclonal antibody generated against a peptide sequence found in both Munc18a and Munc18b (Munc18a/b) identified Munc18a/b in both human brain and human platelets (Fig. 1D). Because the immunoblotting experiments did not directly identify the Munc18b in platelets, we performed reverse transcription-PCR with human platelet mRNA. A PCR product of the appropriate size was obtained from both human platelet and human brain samples with specific Munc18b primers (not shown). Taken together, these immunoblotting and PCR experiments provided evidence that platelets contain Munc18a, Munc18b, and Munc18c. The members of the Munc18 family migrated with the same apparent molecular mass of ∼70 kDa. Trace amounts of Munc18 immunoreactivity were also observed at lower apparent molecular sizes, which may represent partial degradation or alternately spliced transcripts. Previous studies have shown that syntaxins 2 and 4 mediate platelet granule secretion (27Flaumenhaft R. Croce K. Chen E. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2492-2501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Chen D. Bernstein A.M. Lemons P.P. Whiteheart S.W. Blood. 2000; 95: 921-929Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies were generated against recombinant syntaxins 2 and 4, which share 49% amino acid identity. The specificity of these antisera for their cognate syntaxin was examined by immunoblotting. In side by side experiments, the syntaxin 2 antiserum bound preferentially to recombinant syntaxin 2 and showed minimal cross-reactivity with recombinant syntaxin 4 (Fig. 2A). Similarly, the syntaxin 4 antiserum showed highly selective binding to recombinant syntaxin 4 and minimal if any binding to recombinant syntaxin 2 (Fig. 2A). Immunoblotting experiments with these antibodies confirmed the presence of both syntaxin 2 and 4 in platelets that migrated with different relative molecular masses (Fig. 2B). Syntaxin 4 was found exclusively in platelet membranes, whereas syntaxin 2 was detected in both platelet membranes and cytosol (Fig. 2C). In contrast, Munc18c and Munc18a/b proteins were detected in both the cytoplasm and platelet membrane (Fig. 2D). SM-Syntaxin Complex Formation in Human Platelets—To determine the specificity of SM-syntaxin interactions in platelets, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with antibodies against Munc18a/b and Munc18c. The anti-Munc18a/b antibody precipitated Munc18a/b but not Munc18c from platelets (Fig. 3A). Conversely, the anti-Munc18c antibody precipitated Munc18c but not Munc18a/b from platelets (Fig. 3A). These results confirmed the specificity of these antibodies for their respective Munc18. When Munc18c was precipitated from platelets, it was found to be complexed with syntaxin 4, and minimal if any complex formation with syn"

GT sequence analysis suggests that it is composed of at least two domains: the N-terminal domain, which composes 80% of the molecule, has no significant similarity to other known proteins and was proposed to be involved in the recognition of non-native conformers and the C-terminal or catalytic domain, which displays a similar size and significant similarity to members of glycosyltransferase family 8. Here, we show that N- and C-terminal domains from Rattus norvegicus and Schizosaccharomyces pombe GTs remained tightly but not covalently bound upon a mild proteolytic treatment and could not be separated without loss of enzymatic activity. The notion of a two-domain protein was reinforced by the synthesis of an active enzyme upon transfection of S. pombe GT null mutants with two expression vectors, each of them encoding one of both domains. Transfection with the C-terminal domain-encoding vector alone yielded an inactive, rapidly degraded protein, thus indicating that the N-terminal domain is required for proper folding of the C-terminal catalytic portion. If, indeed, the N-terminal domain is, as proposed, also involved in glycoprotein conformation recognition, the tight association between N- and C-terminal domains may explain why only N-glycans in close proximity to protein structural perturbations are glucosylated by the enzyme. Although S. pombe and Drosophila melanogaster GT N-terminal domains display an extremely poor similarity (16.3%), chimeras containing either yeast N-terminal and fly C-terminal domains or the inverse construction were enzymatically and functionally active in vivo, thus indicating that the N-terminal domains of both GTs shared three-dimensional features.

Most proteins following the secretory pathway in eukaryotic cells are N-glycosylated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; GT, UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase. A glycan (Glc3-Man9-GlcNAc2) is transferred to Asn in growing polypeptides. Glucoses are then trimmed by the action of glucosidase I, which removes the external Glc unit, followed by glucosidase II, which excises both Glc residues remaining in the glycan (1Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 631-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (3778) Google Scholar). Monoglucosylated N-glycans may be formed by partial deglucosylation of the transferred oligosaccharide or by reglucosylation of Glc-free glycans by the UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (GT) (2Parodi A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 6. 2000; 9: 69-95Crossref Scopus (537) Google Scholar). This enzyme is a sensor of glycoprotein conformations, as it exclusively glucosylates N-glycans in not properly folded conformers. One or two ER-resident α-mannosidases may degrade Man9-GlcNAc2 to Man8-GlcNAc2 and Man7-GlcNAc2, which may also be reglucosylated by GT. Folding glycoproteins oscillate then between monoglucosylated and unglucosylated forms catalyzed by the opposing activities of GT and glucosidase II. The monoglucosylated forms are recognized by two ER-resident lectins, calnexin and calreticulin. Upon reaching the proper tertiary structures, glycoproteins become substrates of glucosidase II, but not of GT. Properly folded molecules thus liberated from the lectins are then free to pursue their transit to the Golgi. Proteins that fail to properly fold are retained in the ER and are eventually transported to the cytosol, where they are degraded in the proteasomes. Interaction of monoglucosylated glycans with ER lectins not only retains misfolded glycoproteins in the ER, but also facilitates glycoprotein folding by preventing aggregation. GT is therefore the key constituent of the ER quality control of glycoprotein folding, as it is the only element in such a process that discriminates between glycoprotein conformers. In vitro and in vivo assays have shown that, under both conditions, GT preferentially glucosylates glycoproteins not in extended conformations, but at more advanced folding, molten globule-like stages, when glycoprotein substrates already display secondary structures and some long-range interactions (3Trombetta S.E.

Solvent-accessible hydrophobic amino acid patches have been identified as the structural elements recognized by GT in non-native conformers, as they are the only structural features exclusive of molten globule-like folding intermediates (5Labriola C. Cazzulo J.J. Parodi A.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1381-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Moreover, in vitro assays have shown that GT preferentially glucosylates N-glycans in the close vicinity of protein structural perturbations (6Ritter C. Helenius A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 7Quirin, K.

Sequence analysis (BLAST search using a BLOSUM62 matrix) of mammalian, insect, and yeast GTs has suggested that they are composed of at least two domains: the N-terminal domain, which composes 80% of the molecule, has no significant similarity to other known proteins, and has been suggested to be involved in non-native conformer recognition; and the C-terminal domain, which binds 5-azido-[β-32P]UDP-glucose and displays a similar size and significant similarity to members of glycosyltransferase family 8 (8Parker C.G.

Members of this family conserve the anomeric configuration of the monosaccharide transferred from a sugar nucleotide, presumably by forming a monosaccharide-enzyme intermediate. All GT C-terminal domains from different species share a significant similarity (65–70%), but no such similarity may occur between N-terminal domains. For instance, Rattus norvegicus GT (Gen-BankTM/EBI accession number AAF67072) and Drosophila melanogaster GT (accession number Q09332) N-terminal domains share a 32.6% similarity, but they show only 15.5 and 16.3% similarities, respectively, to the same portion of Schizosaccharomyces pombe GT (accession number S63669) (8Parker C.G.

Although there is both structural and experimental evidence supporting the idea that the C-terminal domain is the catalytic portion of the enzyme, the notion that the N-terminal domain is responsible for recognition of non-native conformers has not been experimentally confirmed yet. The work reported here provides experimental evidence for the two-domain GT structure and shows that both domains are tightly bound. If the N-terminal domain is indeed responsible for conformation recognition, this finding provides a molecular rationale for the close proximity between protein structural perturbations and N-glycans required for glucosylation. Moreover, the S. pombe GT N-terminal domain linked to the D. melanogaster GT C-terminal portion or the inverse construction formed enzymatically and functionally active enzymes in vivo. We therefore concluded that N-terminal domains from different GTs share three-dimensional features despite showing an extremely poor similarity in their primary sequences. In addition to the suggested role in the recognition of misfolded conformers, the results presented here indicate that the N-terminal domains are required for proper folding of the catalytic C-terminal portions, as the latter were enzymatically and functionally inactive and rapidly degraded in vivo when expressed in the absence of the former. Yeast Strains, Plasmids, Expression Vectors, and Yeast Growth Media—The following S. pombe strains were used: wild-type, Sp95 (h90, ura4-D18, ade6-M216, leu1-32), Sp61G4 (h–, ade6-M210, leu1-32, ura4-D18, gpt1::ura4-D1684), and Sp61G4A (h–, ade6-M210, ade1, leu1-32, ura4-D18, gpt1::ura4-D1684, alg6::ura4+) (13Fanchiotti S. Fernández F. D'Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBluescript SKgpt1+33A and expression vector pREP3Xgpt1+, which encode S. pombe GT, were generated in our laboratory (13Fanchiotti S. Fernández F. D'Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Plasmid pOT2gpt1+ (D. melanogaster GT) was a generous gift from Dr. S. E. Trombetta (Department of Cell Biology, Yale University Medical School). Expression vectors pREP2 and pREP3X encode the S. pombe ura4+ gene and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae LEU2 gene, respectively. The latter complements the S. pombe leu1 mutation. Rich medium contained 3% glucose (Sigma) and 0.5% yeast extract (Difco). Minimal medium was as described by Alfa et al. (14Alfa C. Fantes P. Hyams J. McLeod M. Warbrick E. Experiments with Fission Yeast: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). The final concentrations of adenine, uracil, and leucine supplements were 75, 75, and 250 μg/ml, respectively. Materials—[14C]Glc (300 Ci/mol) was from New England Nuclear. UDP-[14C]Glc (300 Ci/mol) was prepared according to Wright and Robbins (15Wright A. Robbins P.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1965; 104: 594-595Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. N-Methyldeoxynojirimycin and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H were from Sigma. Anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibodies were a gift from Dr. S. E. Trombetta. Methods—GT was assayed using UDP-[14C]Glc as a sugar donor and denatured thyroglobulin as a glucosyl acceptor as described (16Trombetta S.E. Bosch M. Parodi A.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8108-8116Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Proteins were microsequenced at the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology of the University of Nebraska (Omaha, NE). In constructs described below, the accuracy of all DNA junctions generated was checked by DNA sequencing. S. pombe cells were labeled with [14C]Glc, and the N-glycans were analyzed as described (17Fernández F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but with 2.5 mmN-methyldeoxynojirimycin. Paper chromatography was performed with Whatman No. 1 papers using solvent system A (1-propanol/nitromethane/water (3:2:1)) and solvent system B (1-butanol/pyridine/water (10:3:3)). Similarities of N- and C-terminal domains were obtained by BLAST analysis using a BLOSUM62 matrix. Enzyme Purification and Related Procedures—Microsomes were prepared from R. norvegicus liver and S. pombe cells, and GTs were purified from them to homogeneity as described (17Fernández F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Assays used for attempting to separate cleaved GT N- and C-terminal domains were as described in the indicated purification procedures (17Fernández F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Limited R. norvegicus GT Proteolysis—Purified enzyme (40 μg) was incubated in a total volume of 250 μl containing 10 mm imidazole buffer (pH 7.0), 5% sucrose, and 1 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C (protease V8, Sigma) at 37 °C. Aliquots of 5 μl were used for GT assays after addition of 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (Sigma) at a final concentration of 1 mm. Aliquots of 10 μl were used for 10% SDS-PAGE analysis. Electrophoresis—Nonreducing standard 10% polyacrylamide gels were employed. Purified GT (2 μg) was resuspended in 10 μl of solution containing 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6). N-Ethylmaleimide was added to nonreduced samples at a final concentration of 25 mm. Dithiothreitol was added to reduced samples at a final concentration of 10 mm. Both reduced and nonreduced samples were heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and N-ethylmaleimide (25 mm) was added to the reduced samples to allow direct comparison of both type of samples. Reduced and nonreduced samples were run side by side on the same gels. Western Blot Analysis of Proteins Bearing the c-Myc Epitope—Microsomes prepared from yeast cells grown to A595 nm = 0.5–1.0 were resuspended in 2% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNα-p-tosyl-l-lysyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 mmNα-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 μm E-64, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μm leupeptin. Samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters, and developed with anti-c-Myc antiserum according to standard procedures. Antibodies against the S. pombe GT C-terminal Domain—A 519-bp fragment of S. pombe GT (bases 3658–4176) was amplified using Pwo DNA polymerase (Roche Applied Bioscience), pBluescript SKgpt1+33A as template, and the following oligonucleotides as primers: 5′-CCGGAATTCGTACAATTGGCCACACTGGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTAAATCGATTGTTTTGG-3′ (antisense). The fragment released by EcoRI and NotI treatment (the primers employed generate cleavage sites for these two enzymes) was ligated to the pET22b+ expression vector (Novagen) previously treated with the same enzymes, and the construct was amplified in Escherichia coli NovaBlue cells (Novagen). A protein comprising amino acids 1220–1392 of S. pombe GT fused to a polyhistidine tail was synthesized by transforming E. coli BL26(DE3) cells (Novagen) with above-described construct. The protein in inclusion bodies was washed; dissolved in 6 m urea, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.5 m NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole buffer; and purified by affinity chromatography on Ni2+-iminodiacetic acid-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). A single 20-kDa protein appeared upon 10% SDS-PAGE. Antibodies raised in rabbits reacted with the recombinant protein at least at a 1:1000 serum dilution. Construct with the S. pombe GT N-terminal and D. melanogaster GT C-terminal Domains—Two synonymous mutations (A3461G and A3464C) were introduced into the gpt1+ sequence encoding the N- and C-terminal domain junction in expression vector pREP3Xgpt1+, thus creating a StuI site (cleavage with this enzyme generates a blunt end). For this purpose, the mutagenic oligonucleotide 5′-TTTCAAACGTAAAGAGGCCTCTATAAATATTTTTTCTGTTGCC-3′ and the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis system (Promega) were employed. The resulting vector (pREP3Xgpt1StuI) (Fig. 1A) coded for Glu1154 and Ala1155, the same as the parental one. The fragment encoding the D. melanogaster GT C-terminal domain was synthesized using oligonucleotide primers 5′-CATCTATCAACATTTTCTCTGTGGC-3′ (sense; generates a blunt end) and 5′-TGTACATCCGGACGGGGCTCATGAGAAGGCGTC-3′ (antisense; generates a BspEI site), plasmid pOTgpt1+ as template, and Pwo DNA polymerase. The PCR product was digested with BspEI and ligated to pREP3Xgpt1StuI previously digested with StuI and BspEI. The latter cuts S. pombe gpt1+ just before the ER retrieval sequence. The expression vector generated was termed pREP3Xgpt1CTDm (Fig. 1A). Construct with the D. melanogaster GT N-terminal and S. pombe GT C-terminal Domains—Four mutations (C56G, A57C, A58G, and G59G) were introduced into the gpt1+ sequence encoding the junction between the S. pombe GT signal sequence and the N-terminal domain to create a BssHII site. These mutations resulted in the point mutation K20R at the amino acid level. Mutations were generated by conducting three PCRs. The first one used primers 5′-CGCGGATCCCCCGGGCTGCAGG-3′ (sense; hybridizes with a noncoding region ∼100 bp upstream of the ATG codon and generates a BamHI site) and 5′-CTTGACATCTAAAGGGCGCGCGGCATAGCAAATCG-3′ (antisense and mutagenic; hybridizes with the sequence encoding the signal peptide/N-terminal domain junction). The second PCR used primers 5′-CGATTTGCTATGCCGCGCGCCCTTTAGATGTCAAG-3′ (sense and mutagenic; hybridizes with the sequence encoding the signal peptide/N-terminal domain junction) and 5′-CAACCACTGCGTACGGAATGCC-3′ (antisense; hybridizes ∼500 bp downstream from the ATG codon and generates a BsiWI site), the expression vector pREP3Xgpt1+ as template, and Pwo DNA polymerase. The products of both PCRs were purified, mixed, and used as template for a third PCR, in which the sense and antisense primers were those employed in the first and second reactions, respectively. The 606-bp fragment obtained was digested with BamHI and BsiWI and ligated to expression vector pREP3Xgpt1StuI (Fig. 1A) previously treated with the same enzymes, thus generating expression vector pREP3Xgpt1StuI-BssHII (Fig. 1B). The fragment encoding the N-terminal domain of D. melanogaster GT was synthesized using primers 5′-TTGGCGCGCGAATCCAGTCAGAGCTATCC-3′ (sense; creates a BssHII site at the 5′-end) and 5′-CCGTATCCTCATCAGAGGC-3′ (antisense; generates a blunt end), plasmid pOTgpt1+ as template, and Pwo DNA polymerase. The PCR product was digested with BssHII and ligated to pREP3Xgpt1StuI-BssHII previously digested with StuI and BssHII. The expression vector generated was termed pREP3X gpt1NTDm (Fig. 1B). Truncated Protein Constructs—The expression vector encoding the S. pombe GT signal peptide followed by the N-terminal domain and the ER retrieval sequence was synthesized by first performing inverse PCR using pBluescript SKgpt1+33A (which encodes full-length GT) as template and oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCGGACGAACTTTGAAAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAAGAAGCTGAGAGACTT-3′ (antisense). The first primer encodes the retrieval plus stop sequences, and the second one encodes the N- and C-terminal domain junction (centered in base 3444 from the ATG codon). The fragment was purified, phosphorylated, religated, and amplified in E. coli DH5α cells (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid (pBluescript SKgpt1NT) was digested with SnaBI and BspEI. The 555-bp fragment generated was ligated to expression vector pREP2gpt1+ previously treated with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting expression vector was pREP2gpt1NT (Fig. 1C). The expression vector encoding the GT signal peptide followed by the C-terminal domain and the ER retrieval sequence was constructed in a similar way, but with the following primers: 5′-AATTTCAAACGTAAAGAAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GGCGGCATAGCAAATCG-3′ (antisense). The first primer encodes the N- and C-terminal domain junction, and the second one starts at the sequence coding for the junction between the GT signal sequence and the mature protein sequence. The resulting plasmid (pBluescript SKgpt1CT) was digested with BamHI and NruI. The resulting 590-bp fragment was ligated to the expression vector pREP3Xgpt1+ previously treated with the same restriction enzymes. The resulting expression vector was pREP3Xgpt1CT (Fig. 1C). Insertion of the c-Myc Epitope at the C Termini—For inserting the c-myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN) into chimeric and truncated proteins before the ER retrieval sequence, oligonucleotide primers 5′-CCGGAACAAAAACTCATCTCAGAAGAGGATCTGAAT-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCGGATTCAGATCCTCTTCTGAGATGAGTTTTTGTT-3′ (antisense) were annealed and ligated to the above-described constructs previously digested with BspEI. The sequence coded for the epitope and left, at both ends, sequences able to bind DNA previously digested with the restriction enzyme. All constructs had an additional Pro residue before the c-Myc epitope. The resulting expression vector designations include “c-myc” to indicate insertion of the epitope-encoding sequence. Linkage between the N- and C-terminal Domains Is Extremely Sensitive to Endoproteolysis—Fig. 2A shows that almost all pure S. pombe GT preparations yielded three bands when subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. The same result was obtained also with some R. norvegicus enzyme preparations (Fig. 2B). The sizes of the fragments were 161, 130, and 35 kDa for yeast GT and 172, 135, and 38 kDa for the mammalian enzyme. The results obtained from microsequencing the N termini are depicted in Fig. 2 (A and B). They reveal that, in both cases, the smaller fragments had been produced by endoproteolytic breakage of the full-length species at the junction between the N- and C-terminal domains (amino acids 1149 and 1220 from the initial Met residue for the yeast and mammalian GTs, respectively) (Figs. 2, A and B, and 3). As expected, the largest and smallest (but not the middle) fragments of S. pombe GT reacted with polyclonal antibodies directed against a C-terminal 172-amino acid fragment of the molecule (Figs. 1A and 2C).Fig. 3Comparison of S. pombe and R. norvegicus sequences.

The arrow indicates the sites of endoproteolytic cleavages.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Noncovalent Linkages Tightly Bind Both Domains—The N- and C-terminal domains of R. norvegicus and S. pombe GTs proved to be tightly bound, as the small fragment yielded by endoproteolytic degradation could not be separated from the middle one by gel filtration on a Bio-Sil SEC 250 column (Fig. 4, A and C), by chromatography on a phenyl-Superose column (Fig. 4, B and D), by ion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q HR 5/5 column, and by filtration through a Centricon-100 filter (data not shown). Moreover, the linkage between both domains was not mediated by disulfide bonding as revealed by 10% SDS-PAGE performed under reducing and nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4, E and F). The small and middle fragments of both R. norvegicus and yeast GTs were retained on a concanavalin A-Sepharose column despite the fact that the mammalian enzyme C-terminal domain lacks N-glycosylation consensus sequences and that the only one present at such a location in the yeast enzyme was unoccupied as revealed by 10% SDS-PAGE following endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment (data not shown). This result shows that the N- and C-terminal domains could not be separated also by lectin affinity chromatography. Noncovalently Bound N- and C-terminal Domains Are Enzymatically Active and Able to Discriminate between Native and Non-native Conformers—We observed that certain S. pombe preparations were enzymatically active despite almost totally lacking the full-length protein component. A slight modification of the purification procedure was then introduced to fully eliminate it: the interaction period of the applied material with the concanavalin A-Sepharose column before elution with α-methylmannoside was increased from 1 to 12 h. As depicted in Fig. 5 (A and C), although the resulting preparation completely lacked the full-length enzyme, it displayed enzymatic activity. As expected, the largest fragment in the extensively degraded preparation did not react with antibodies directed against the last portion of the C terminus (Fig. 5B). As the same procedure (longer interaction of the applied material with concanavalin A-Sepharose) did not yield an R. norvegicus preparation devoid of the full-length enzyme, the purified GT was incubated with protease V8. As shown in Fig. 5D, the full-length R. norvegicus enzyme disappeared after a 5-min incubation, yielding 135-plus 38-kDa fragments that displayed almost full enzymatic activity. Microsequencing of the latter yielded the sequence SFKWG, indicating that protease V8 cleavage had occurred at amino acid 1211 from the initial Met residue, i.e. 9 amino acids ahead of that produced by endoproteolytic cleavage (see above). The 38-kDa protein was gradually further degraded to smaller fragments, and the enzymatic activity was concomitantly lost (Fig. 5D). Both R. norvegicus and S. pombe enzyme preparations devoid of full-length components glucosylated denatured (but not native) thyroglobulin (data not shown). N- and C-terminal Domains May Be Expressed Separately, Yielding an Active Enzyme—The notion of a two-domain GT structure able to display enzymatic activity even if not covalently bound was supported by the synthesis of an active enzyme upon transfection of a GT null mutant (Sp61G4) with two plasmids separately encoding the N and C termini (Table I). Nevertheless, microsomes prepared from cells transformed with both expression vectors displayed a lower specific enzymatic activity than those isolated from cells transformed with a plasmid coding for the full-length enzyme. Constructs coding for either one of both domains had segments encoding the GT signal peptide before the enzymatic domains and a c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDLN) and the GT ER retrieval sequence (PDEL) after them (Fig. 1C). Western blots with c-Myc-specific monoclonal antibodies showed that both fragments had been effectively expressed (Fig. 6A). As with wild-type GT proteolytically cleaved at the domain junction, the enzyme formed by the separately expressed domains was also able to discriminate between native and non-native conformers. No enzymatic activity was detected in microsomes isolated from cells transformed with only the C-terminal domain-encoding vector, although, as will be seen below, the fragment was effectively expressed as revealed by Western blot analysis (Table I).Table IActivity of separately expressed S. pombe GT N- and C-terminal domainsExpression vectorsaS. pombe GT- cells (Sp61G4) were transfected with the indicated expression vectors encoding the S. pombe GT C-terminal (pREP3X gpt1CT-c-myc) and N-terminal (pREP2gpt1NT-c-myc) domains and full-length S. pombe GT (pREP3Xgpt1+-c-myc).ActivitybValues are expressed as counts/min./mg of microsomal protein.pREP228pREP3Xgpt1CT-c-myc42pREP2gpt1NT-c-myc + pREP3Xgpt1CT-c-myc1071pREP3Xgpt1+-c-myc5840a S. pombe GT- cells (Sp61G4) were transfected with the indicated expression vectors encoding the S. pombe GT C-terminal (pREP3X gpt1CT-c-myc) and N-terminal (pREP2gpt1NT-c-myc) domains and full-length S. pombe GT (pREP3Xgpt1+-c-myc).b Values are expressed as counts/min./mg of microsomal protein. Open table in a new tab D. melanogaster and S. pombe GT N- and C-terminal Domains Are Mutually Interchangeable—As shown above, in both yeast and mammalian GTs, the N- and C-terminal domains are tightly bound and show enzymatic activity even in the absence of any covalent linkage between them. This was a rather unexpected result because whereas the C-terminal domains of R. norvegicus, D. melanogaster, and S. pombe share a high similarity (62.3–74.0%), much lower values occur for the N-terminal portions (32.6% for the R. norvegicus and D. melanogaster GTs and 15.5–16.3% for the latter enzymes and S. pombe GT). In other words, to bind highly similar C-terminal domains, the tertiary structures of the N-terminal portions of different GTs should be expected to share three-dimensional features. To confirm that the N-terminal domains from different GTs share elements of tertiary structure, two types of chimeras were constructed in expression vector pREP3X. The first one encoded the D. melanogaster GT N-terminal and S. pombe GT C-terminal domains (Fig. 1B). The second construct coded for the yeast GT N-terminal and fly GT C-terminal domains (Fig. 1A). These constructs, together with those encoding either the full-length S. pombe enzyme or only its C-terminal portion, were transfected into S. pombe Sp61G4A mutant cells. All constructs coded for the S. pombe GT signal peptide at the N termini and for the above-mentioned c-Myc epitope before the S. pombe GT ER retrieval sequence (PDEL). Sp61G4A mutants lack GT and transfer to Man9-GlcNAc2 instead of the complete glycan, as they lack the dolichol-P-Glc-dependent glucosyltransferase responsible for Glc1-Man9-GlcNAc2-P-P-dolichol formation. As they synthesize underglycosylated glycoproteins and lack the folding facilitation process mediated by glycoprotein-calnexin interaction, these double mutant cells grow poorly with a round morphology at 28 °C and do not grow at 37 °C. Their transformation with a GT-encoding expression vector rescued the wild-type phenotype, but no rescue was observed when two point mutations that abolished GT activity were introduced at the C-terminal domain (13Fanchiotti S. Fernández F. D'Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were incubated with 5 mm [14C]Glc in the presence of N-methyldeoxynojirimycin, a glucosidase II inhibitor. Analysis of whole cell N-oligosaccharides released by endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H showed that, in addition to peaks migrating as a Man9-GlcNAc standard, shoulders in the position expected for Glc1-Man9-GlcNAc were formed in cells transfected with full-length S. pombe GT or with both chimeras coding for mixed yeast-fly enzymes (Fig. 7, A, C, and D). On the contrary, the Glc1-Man9-GlcNAc shoulder was absent in cells transformed with the S. pombe GT C-terminal portion (Fig. 7B). Formation of Glc1-Man9-GlcNAc2 in cells transformed with full-length GTs and its absence in mutants transformed with the C-terminal domain were confirmed by strong acid hydrolysis of substances migrating as Glc1-Man9-GlcNAc and Man9-GlcNAc standards in Fig. 7, A–D. Labeled glucose residues were present only in substances derived from cells transformed by the expression vector encoding full-length GTs (Fig. 7, E–H). The C-terminal domain was effectively expressed as revealed by Western blot analysis; but the protein was extremely unstable, as no expressed protein was detected after a 2-h incubation of intact cells with cycloheximide, thus strongly suggesting that it had been unable to properly fold in the absence of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 4). On the contrary, full-length S. pombe GT continued to be detected after a similar cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 6B, lanes 1 and 2) To confirm that the chimeric enzymes were not only enzymatically, but also functionally active in vivo, we investigated whether they rescued the non-growth phenotype of Sp61G4A mutants at 37 °C. As shown in Fig. 8, A–C, in all cases, the mutant cells transformed with full-length GT constructs, but not with either the C-terminal domain-encoding expression vector or with the vector itself, grew at 37 °C. As in Sp61G4A double mutant cells grown at 28 °C (Fig. 6B, lanes 3 and 4), Western blot analysis of microsomal proteins isolated from Sp61G4 single mutant cells transformed with the C-terminal domain expression vector showed that the C-terminal domain was expressed at 37 °C, but was unstable, as it disappeared after a 2-h incubation of cells with cycloheximide (Fig. 6B, lanes 5 and 6). (Sp61G4 cells lack GT, but transfer Glc3-Man9-Glc-NAc2 and are able to grow at 37 °C.) The results reported herein provide experimental evidence for the two-domain GT structure suggested by the amino acid sequence, as expression of both portions, each of them encoded by different vectors, in an S. pombe GT null mutant resulted in the synthesis of an active enzyme. Expression of the C-terminal or catalytic domain resulted in the synthesis of an inactive, highly unstable protein. Moreover, although linkage between both domains in the wild-type enzyme was extremely sensitive to proteolysis, both portions could not be separated by ion-exchange, size-exclusion, lectin affinity, and hydrophobic interaction chromatographies without loss of enzymatic activity. It is worth remarking that only the N-terminal domain is N-glycosylated and that there is an almost 4-fold difference in size between both domains. Moreover, the cleaved molecules were able to discriminate between native and non-native glycoprotein conformers. As mentioned above, the C-terminal domains displayed approximately the same size and significant sequence similarity to members of the glycosyltransferase family 8. It has also been reported that this portion of the molecule has the ability to bind 5-azido-[β-32P]UDP-glucose (10Tessier D.C. Dignard D. Zapun A. Radominska-Pandya A. Parodi A.J. Begeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the C-terminal domain is the catalytic portion of the molecule where formation of the putative glycosyl-enzyme intermediate takes place. Expression of the R. norvegicus GT C-terminal domain in insect cells yielded a protein displaying ∼5% of the specific full-length enzymatic activity (10Tessier D.C. Dignard D. Zapun A. Radominska-Pandya A. Parodi A.J. Begeron J.J.M. Thomas D.Y. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 403-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It was not reported, however, whether the recombinant truncated enzyme discriminated between properly and not properly folded glycoprotein substrates. As shown above and will be further discussed below, we were unable to obtain an enzyme active either in vivo or in vitro upon expressing the S. pombe C-terminal domain in a yeast GT null mutant. It has been suggested that the GT N-terminal domain is responsible for sensing the folding status of glycoprotein substrates. An additional or alternative role (or perhaps the sole one) is, as demonstrated here, to contribute to proper folding of the catalytic or C-terminal domain within the ER luminal environment. To confirm the presence of common tertiary structural elements in the N-terminal domains of different GTs, as suggested by the tight association between highly similar C-terminal and highly divergent N-terminal domains, chimeras containing the D. melanogaster GT N-terminal and S. pombe GT C-terminal domains or the yeast GT N-terminal and fly GT C-terminal domains were expressed in S. pombe GT null mutants. Chimeric proteins were enzymatically active in vivo and were able to rescue the wild-type phenotype (growth at 37 °C) of gpt1/alg6 double mutant cells (Sp61G4A). These mutants lack GT and synthesize underglycosylated glycoproteins, as they transfer (inefficiently) Man9-GlcNAc2 instead of Glc3-Man9-GlcNAc2 (13Fanchiotti S. Fernández F. D'Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The severe ER stress to which they are submitted prevents their growth at 37 °C, but the wild-type phenotype could be restored upon transformation with an expression vector coding for an active GT. The underglycosylated glycoprotein(s) that necessarily required GT-mediated interaction with calnexin for proper folding at high temperature was probably somehow involved in cell wall synthesis, as the wild-type phenotype could be rescued also in a hyperosmotic medium (1 m sorbitol) (13Fanchiotti S. Fernández F. D'Alessio C. Parodi A.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The expressed C-terminal domain was inactive in vivo and was also unable to rescue the wild-type phenotype. As in cells grown at 28 °C, the protein was unstable at 37 °C, probably reflecting its inability to properly fold in the absence of the N-terminal domain. As protein domains in glycoprotein substrates that determine the exclusive glucosylation of non-native conformers probably do not share identical three-dimensional structures, the corresponding recognition domains in glucosyltransferases from different species might not be expected to necessarily display significant similarity in their tertiary structures. In other words, it may be that recognition of hydrophobic amino acid patches in molten globule conformers could be attained by GTs displaying a variety of different N-terminal domain conformations if those domains were indeed responsible for sensing glycoprotein substrate conformations. In fact, GTs purified from R. norvegicus and S. pombe, which share only a 15.5% similarity in their N-terminal domain primary sequences, were shown to display the same exclusive specificity for non-native conformers in in vitro assays (17Fernández F.S. Trombetta S.E. Hellman U. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30701-30706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Trombetta S.E. Parodi A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9236-9240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results presented here, however, show that, despite the extremely poor primary sequence similarity shown by GT N-terminal domains from different species, such portions probably share substantial elements of tertiary structure, as yeast and fly GT N-terminal domains were able to facilitate folding and stabilization of the GT C-terminal portions of both species alike. A very unique feature of GT is that it glucosylates only N-glycans in the very near proximity of protein structural perturbations. It was recently reported that only the N-glycan attached to the misfolded subunit of an artificial dimer formed by properly folded and misfolded RNase B monomers was glucosylated by GT in in vitro assays (6Ritter C. Helenius A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 278-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that the N-glycan was glucosylated only when present in the immediate vicinity of the localized protein structural perturbation introduced into a mutant RNase B monomer by abolishing one of the four disulfide bonds present in the wild-type molecule (7Quirin, K. (2002) Substrate Specificity and Enzymatic Properties of Bovine UDP-Glc:Glycoprotein Glucosyltransferase, an ER Folding Sensor. Diploma thesis, Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, ZurichGoogle Scholar). These recent results agree with previous ones reporting that N-glycans and misfolded protein subunits have to be covalently linked to be glucosylated (19Sousa M. Parodi A.J. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 4196-4203Crossref Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The close proximity between both structural elements required for efficient glucosylation (N-glycans and structural perturbations) may be best explained by the results reported herein, i.e. by the intimate association between the catalytic (C-terminal) and putative misfolded recognition (N-terminal) domains by noncovalent bonding. It should be stressed that ascription of the location of the conformation recognition site to the N-terminal domain is merely speculative. It could be that its sole role is, as demonstrated here, to facilitate folding and stabilization of the catalytic C-terminal portion and that the conformation-sensing site resides also in this last part of the molecule. The sole evidence against this possibility is that enzymes belonging to glycosyltransferase family 8, with which GT C-terminal domains share a similar size and significant sequence similarity, probably do not have the capacity to discriminate between glycoprotein conformers, as most of them are not involved in glycoprotein glycosylation. On the other hand, the close proximity between the N-glycan and the protein structural perturbation required for glucosylation could also be explained if both the catalytic and conformation recognition sites reside in the relatively small (∼35 kDa) C-terminal domains."
https://openalex.org/W2099311883,"Although the progression of prostate cancer initially is dependent on androgens, tumor progression to an androgen-independent growth eventually occurs in most of patients treated with androgen ablation and/or antiandrogen therapy. After the initial response, antiandrogens lose their efficacy and eventually act as agonists to promote androgen receptor (AR)-mediated growth of prostate cancer cells. An aberrant regulation of AR activity, presumably by AR coregulators, may contribute to this acquired agonist activity of antiandrogens. Using an in vitro mutagenesis and a double-negative selection in yeast two-hybrid screening, we have identified a dominant-negative AR coregulator ARA70 (dARA70N), which can inhibit AR transcriptional activity by inactivating the normal function of ARA70 in the LNCaP cells. Whereas ARA70 in oligomeric form interacts with AR and enhances its transcriptional activity, dARA70N lacks AR interaction and might retain the ability to form a non-functional heteromer with ARA70 and interrupt AR transcriptional activity without a change in AR protein itself. The addition of dARA70N reduces the agonist activity and rescues the normal function of antiandrogens in prostate cancer cells. RNA-interference-mediated silencing of ARA70 gene further confirms these observations. Taken together, these findings indicate that ARA70 may contribute to the acquired agonist activity of antiandrogens and plays an important role in making prostate cancer cells resistant to androgen ablation and/or antiandrogen therapy. ARA70 may, thus, be a critical target for developing therapeutic agents against AR-mediated progression of prostate cancer.

Prostate cancer still remains the most frequently diagnosed malignancy in aging men, and each year about 31,500 men in the United States lose their lives to this malignancy (1Greenlee R.T. Hill-Harmon M.B. Murray T. Thun M. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 2001; 51: 15-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (3330) Google Scholar). Androgens and the androgen receptor (AR) 1The abbreviations used are: AR, androgen receptor; ARA70N, N-terminal of ARA70; dARA70N, dominant-negative ARA70N; ARE, androgen response element; Luc, luciferase; MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; PSA, prostate-specific antigen; SRC-1, steroid receptor coactivator-1; DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone; E2, 17β-estradiol; HF, hydroxyflutamide; wt, wild type; AD, activation domain; RNAi, RNA-interference. play key roles in this malignancy, and since 1941 androgen ablation has been the cornerstone of treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic prostate cancer. Androgen deprivation, as achieved by surgical or chemical castration, usually results in a favorable clinical response and a dramatic regression of prostate tumor (2Huggins C. Stevens R. Hodges C.V. Arch. Surg. 1941; 43: 209-233Crossref Google Scholar, 3Westin P. Stattin P. Damber J.-E. Bergh A. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1368-1375PubMed Google Scholar). Although 80–90% of patients initially respond to this therapy, tumors gradually become resistant, and eventually most of the patients develop androgen-independent progression of the disease. Although castration alone causes a 95% reduction in serum testosterone levels, the concentration of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) does not fall below 60%, because of the presence of circulating adrenal androgens, which are effectively converted to DHT in the prostate tissue (4Dennis L.J. Griffiths K. Semin. Surg. Oncol. 2000; 18: 52-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 5Labrie F. Belanger A. Dupont A. Luu-The V. Simard J. Labrie C. Clin. Invest. Med. 1993; 16: 475-492PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, prostate DHT levels still remain relatively high even after castration. To overcome this effect, ablation therapy has been supplemented with antiandrogens that can block remaining androgen action. This is called maximal ablation therapy (6Goktas S. Crawford E.D. Semin. Oncol. 1999; 26: 162-173PubMed Google Scholar, 7Schellhammer P.F. Urology. 1996; 47: 622-628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and recently it has become the predominant form of treatment for advanced prostate cancer patients. Although originally designed to produce a complete blockade of AR-mediated growth, this therapy also failed to deliver a significant improvement in 5-year survival (8Prostate Cancer Trialist's Collaborative Group Lancet. 2000; 355: 1491-1498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). After an initial clinical response, most often cancer progression relapses and continues in the presence of androgen ablation and/or antiandrogens. It has been postulated that during advanced stages, antiandrogens lose their efficacy as antagonists and instead function as agonists to promote AR-mediated growth of prostate cancer cells (9Culig Z. Hoffmann J. Erdel M. Eder I.E. Hobisch A. Hittmair A. Bartsch G. Utermann G. Schneider M.R. Parczyk K. Klocker H. Br. J.

In some cases, patients treated with antiandrogens ultimately suffer from withdrawal syndrome whereby antiandrogens become androgenic. This results in an agonist effect with an increase of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), a marker for monitoring the progress of prostate cancer (12Kelly W.K. Eur. Urol. 1998; 34: 18-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of this transition, which promotes AR function, is largely unknown. Because the majority of androgen-independent tumors and metastases retain a functional AR signaling pathway (13Grossmann M.E. Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 1687-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 14Feldman B.J. Feldman D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 34-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (1965) Google Scholar), molecules or proteins other than AR itself have been postulated to play some roles in this transition stage. AR coregulators that are able to enhance AR activity could be one such candidate. One of the AR coregulators, ARA70, has been characterized as having the capacity to enhance AR transcriptional activity in response not only to testicular or normally weak adrenal androgens but also to the antiandrogens hydroxyflutamide (HF) and 17β-estradiol (E2) in prostate cancer cells (15Yeh S.

(22Zhou Z.-X. He B. Hall S.H. Wilson E.M. French F.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 287-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) also show that ARA70 could induce E2-mediated AR transactivation. In contrast, Gao et al. (23Gao T. Brantley K. Bolu E. McPhaul M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1645-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) report that E2 has little induction on AR transactivation in the absence or presence of ARA70 in CV-1 cells. The reasons for these discrepancies using the same CV-1 cells yet having different results remain unclear. However, using HeLa, PC3, and TSU-Pr1 cells, other laboratories also demonstrate that ARA70 could induce E2-mediated AR activity (24Agoulnik, I., Stenoien, D., Mancini, M. A., and Weigel, N.

Byers S. Gelmann E.P. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 4709-4713PubMed Google Scholar). HER2/Neu, a member of the epidermal growth factor family of receptor tyrosine kinases, has been reported to activate the AR-signaling pathway in the absence of androgens and to “superactivate” AR signaling in the presence of low levels of androgens (27Craft N. Shostak Y. Carey M. Sawyears C. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 280-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (845) Google Scholar, 28Yeh S. Lin H.-K. Kang H.-Y. Thin T.H. Lin M.-F. Chang C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The mechanisms of this modulation of AR signaling by HER2/Neu could involve the phosphorylation of AR, which could then enhance the interaction between AR and ARA70. All these results suggested that the interaction between AR and ARA70 could play important roles for the proper or maximal AR activity as well as modulation of AR specificity toward agonists and antagonists. In this study, using a dominant-negative approach, we investigated whether interruption or modulation of AR-ARA70 interaction could lead to down-regulation of AR functional activity in response to both agonists and antagonists, which may have critical implications in the AR-mediated growth of prostate cancer. Our findings provide more direct evidence for the contribution of ARA70 in the acquired agonist activity of antiandrogens and in making prostate cancer cells resistant to ablation and/or antiandrogen therapy. Chemicals and Plasmids—E2, DHT, and hydroxylamine were purchased from Sigma, and HF was a gift from Schering. pGAD10-ARA70N fused with GAL4 activation domain (AD) was the clone originally identified from the cDNA library. pAS2-AR containing the C terminus of the AR ligand binding domain from wild-type (wt) AR fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain, pGAL0-AR containing AR ligand binding domain fused with GAL4 DNA binding domain, and pCMX-VP16-ARA70 or dARA70N fused to the AD of VP16 were constructed as previously described (16Yeh S. Kang H.-Y. Miyamoto H. Nishimura K. Chang H.-C. Ting H.-J. Rahman M. Lin H.-K. Fujimoto N. Hu Y.-C. Mizokami A. Huang K.E. Chang C. Endocrine. 1999; 11: 195-202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pSG5-AR, pSG5-ARA55, pSG5-ARA70, pSG5-ARA54, and pSG5-SRC-1 were constructed as previously described (10Miyamoto H. Yeh S. Wilding G.

AR antibody NH27 was from Dr. Mizokami, ARA70 antibody was from Pharmingen, and the PSA antibody was obtained from DAKO. Generation of Mutant ARA70N Library—The ARA70N mutant library was made by hydroxylamine-mediated mutagenesis (29Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Method Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). About 100 μg of the plasmid DNA, pGAD10-ARA70N, was incubated in 5 ml of 1 m hydroxylamine for 1 h at 70 °C. The plasmid DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform (1:1) and recovered with ethanol precipitation. Yeast Two-hybrid System—The hydroxylamine-mutated pGAD10-ARA70N library was transformed into Y190 yeast cells expressing AR (previously transformed with pAS2-AR). The transformants were plated on synthetic dropout medium lacking tryptophan and leucine in the presence of 100 nm DHT. A pool of white colonies indicating no interaction between AR and ARA70N mutants was selected by the β-galactosidase colony-lift filter assay. The plasmid DNA expressing ARA70 mutants was isolated from yeast cells that spontaneously lost the cycloheximide-sensitive pAS2-derived AR construct upon plating the white colonies on synthetic dropout medium lacking leucine in the presence of 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma). This pool of non-interacting mutants was further transformed into yeast strain Y190 expressing both AR and ARA70N (previously generated by a sequential transformation). A number of mutants that generated more than 90% white colonies on β-galactosidase assay were selected as potential dominant-negative mutants. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The dominant-negative mutant dARA70N was recreated by site-directed mutagenesis of the pSG5-ARA70N construct, using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Invitrogen). The full-length ARA70 mutant (dARA70fl) and alanine- and aspartate-substituted ARA70N (Ala-308 and Asp-308, respectively) were also constructed by this method. Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, and the Reporter Gene Assay— The COS-1 and the PC-3 cells were routinely maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and the LNCaP cells were maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen). All media were supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS, Bio products for Science, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Transient transfection was done using SuperFect transfection reagent as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). Briefly, cells were seeded in the culture medium on 12-well Petri dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/dish for 24 h before transfection. One hour before transfection, the medium was replaced with 10% charcoal-dextran stripped FCS medium. After a 3-h transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh 10% charcoal-dextran stripped FCS medium, and after 16 h of transfection, cells were treated with ligand or ethanol and incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were then harvested, lysed, and assayed for luciferase (Luc) activity using the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega). Construction of DNA Vector-based RNA-interference (RNAi) Plasmids—The 19-nucleotide coding sequences, corresponding to the target sequences followed by a 5-nucleotide spacer, and an inverted repeat of the coding sequences plus 5 Ts, were subcloned into plasmid BS/U6 (30Sui G. Soohoo C. Affar E.B. Gay F. Shi Y. Forrester W.C. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) at the ApaI (blunt)/EcoRI site. For example, the DNA template (sense) for RNAi-A (corresponding to nucleotides 348–366) was 5′-TCA AGT CTC TGT GTG CCT GTT CCG CAG GCA CAC AGA GAC TTG ATT TTT-3′. The selection of coding sequences was determined empirically and was analyzed by blast search to avoid any significant sequence homology with other genes. Using primer extension, we first generated the double-stranded DNA with an ApaI (blunt) and EcoRI site, which was then cloned into BS/U6 plasmid after enzyme digestion. The construction of RNAi-B and RNAi-C were also done in a similar manner. Mammalian Two-hybrid System—COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with a GAL4 hybrid expression plasmid, a VP16 hybrid expression plasmid, and the reporter plasmid pG5-Luc and the Renilla luciferase internal control plasmid. Transfections and Luc assays were performed as previously described (31Miyamoto H. Rahman M. Takatera H. Kang H.-Y. Yeh S. Chang H.-C. Nishimura K. Fujimoto N. Chang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4609-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Total protein of cell extracts obtained from LNCaP cells transfected with expression plasmids or control vector were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of proteins (75.0 μg) were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) using a standard protocol. The detection of the specific antibodies binding to the ARA70, AR, or PSA protein was accomplished using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) or alkaline phosphatase Western-blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation of Overexpressed Proteins and Immunoblotting—The cell lysates from COS-1 cells transfected with expression plasmids or control vector were sonicated 2 × 10 s, followed by 10 min of centrifugation. Equal amounts (500 μg) of total proteins were incubated (immunoprecipitated) with specific antibodies or control IgG at 4 °C for 2 h followed by the addition of 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and incubated for an additional1hat 4 °C. The bound proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and blotted with phosphoserine antibody. The bands representing the proteins of interest were detected with ECL (Bio-Rad) or alkaline phosphatase detection systems (Amersham Biosciences). Identification of a Dominant-negative ARA70 Mutant—The strategy for the identification of dominant-negative mutants was based on the assumption that the ARA70 mutant, which loses its interaction with AR, might inhibit AR transcriptional activity by inactivating the normal function of the wt ARA70, presumably via a heteromer formation. Using hydroxylamine-mediated mutagenesis, a library of ARA70 mutants was generated. Because the N-terminal ARA70 is responsible for interaction and enhancement of AR transactivation, we used ARA70 N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–401) to generate the library of ARA70N mutants. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, the mutated library was screened for those mutants that did not interact with AR. The screening system was further extended to screen out those non-interacting mutants that could effectively interfere with the interaction between ARA70 and AR in a dominant-negative fashion. A pool of potential dominant-negative mutants was, thus, generated by this double negative selection in yeast two-hybrid assay. We then subcloned these potential dominant-negative mutants into a mammalian expression vector, pSG5, and assayed their dominant-negative effects in COS-1 cells that do not express ARA70 or AR. We co-transfected ARA70N mutants and ARA70N along with AR and a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Luc reporter gene. After 24 h of androgen treatment, cells were harvested and assayed for Luc activity as a function of AR transcriptional activity. One select ARA70 mutant showed up to 90% inhibition of ARA70-enhanced AR transactivation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1a). When MMTV-Luc was replaced by PSA-Luc, containing a natural PSA promoter, or by a synthetic (ARE)4-Luc, similar results were obtained (Fig. 1, b and c). The inhibition was specific for ARA70, since the mutant did not affect AR transactivation by other related AR coactivators including ARA54, ARA55, or SRC-1 (Fig. 2A). Also, the inhibition was relatively selective for AR, since the effect on other related nuclear receptors including glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and progesterone receptor (PR) was not significant in PC-3 prostate cancer cells that express endogenous ARA70 (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that mutant ARA70N functionally inactivates ARA70 and thereby inhibits ARA70-enhanced AR transactivation in the cells. We selected this mutant as dominant-negative ARA70 mutant and designated it as dARA70N. Sequence analysis revealed a single point mutation (C to T transition) resulting in a proline to serine substitution at amino acid 308 of ARA70N (dARA70NP308S). The recreation of the mutant by site-directed mutagenesis has resulted in similar results (data not shown). Although relatively less effective, the full-length ARA70 mutant (dARA70fl) inhibited ARA70fl-enhanced AR transcriptional activity (Fig. 1a, lanes 10–11).Fig. 2The mutant ARA70N (dARA70N) selectively inhibits ARA70-enhanced AR transactivation.A, COS-1 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of AR, 0.5 μg of MMTV-Luc, and 1.0 μg of each AR-coregulator as indicated in the figure either in the presence or absence of 2.0 μg of dARA70N. After 24 h of ligand treatment, the Luc activity was measured as in Fig. 1. B, PC-3 cells that express endogenous ARA70 were transfected with AR, progesterone receptor (PR), or glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression plasmid alone or in the presence of ARA70N or dARA70N. After 24 h of ligand or vehicle treatment, receptor activity was measured using MMTV-Luc reporter gene assay. Values represent the mean ± S.D. of at least three independent determinations and are presented as the ratio of MMTV-Luc versus Renilla Luc activity for each sample.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Dominant-negative ARA70N Inhibits AR Transcriptional Activity in Prostate Cancer Cells—The PC-3 prostate cancer cells, which express endogenous ARA70, were transfected with dARA70N or ARA70N along with AR and an MMTV-Luc reporter gene. After 24 h of ligand treatment, cells were harvested, and AR transcriptional activity was measured as mentioned above. As depicted in Fig. 3A, a, 1 nm DHT treatment stimulated AR activity about 15-fold compared with mock-treated cells. Even though PC-3 cells express endogenous ARA70, transfection of ARA70N further increased, whereas dARA70N significantly inhibited AR transcriptional activity. This inhibition was further confirmed in two other prostate cancer cell lines, PC-3(AR)2 and LNCaP, which express endogenous AR as well as ARA70 (Fig. 3A, b and c, respectively). The PC-3(AR)2 is a stably expressed AR cell line derived from parental PC-3 cells, and the LNCaP has a mutated yet functional AR, which was also found in human prostate tumors. When MMTV-Luc was replaced by PSA-Luc or by a synthetic (ARE)4-Luc, similar results were obtained (data not shown). To further determine the suppression effect of dARA70N in endogenous AR target gene, we analyzed the expression of PSA that is widely used as a marker for monitoring prostate cancer progression (32Palmberg C. Koivisto P. Visakorpi T. Tammela T.L. Eur. Urol. 1999; 36: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 33Kelly W.K. Scher H.I. Mazumdar M. Vlamis V. Schwartz M. Fossa S.D. J. Clin. Oncol. 1993; 11: 607-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). We transfected dARA70N or ARA70N into LNCaP cells, treated them for 24 h with DHT or vehicle, and then harvested the cells and assayed for PSA expression using Western blot analysis. The LNCaP cells express PSA in response to androgen (Fig. 3B, a, lane 2), which was significantly inhibited by transfection of dARA70N (lanes 4 and 5). Because LNCaP cells express relatively higher endogenous ARA70, transfection of an additional ARA70N slightly increased PSA levels in these cells (lane 3). It is possible that the activation of the AR target gene (PSA) may be already optimal or saturated by those higher expressed endogenous ARA70s and ARs in the cells. The expression of transfected ARA70N and dARA70N has been shown in Fig. 3B, c. The inhibition was independent of any change of the expression of AR or ARA70, since dARA70N did not influence the expression of the AR or ARA70 protein levels in the cells (Fig. 3B, b and c, respectively). Because dARA70N selectively inactivates endogenous wtARA70 in the cells, we did not expect the level of AR protein to change. The fact that dARA70N inhibited the expression of AR target gene (PSA) without a change in AR protein itself may represent a very significant finding in this study. It not only indicates the role of ARA70 in AR transcriptional activity but also that AR functional activity could be regulated by modulating the expression of AR coactivator, ARA70, in the cells. Taken together, these findings thus offer strong evidence for the potential roles of ARA70 on the AR-mediated progression of prostate cancer. Dominant-negative ARA70N Reduces the Agonist Activity of Antiandrogens in Prostate Cancer Cells—Treatment of prostate cancer patients with maximal ablation therapy, a combination of surgical or chemical castration with antiandrogens such as bicalutamide or HF, still has limited success. Although initially effective, most patients fail to respond to this therapy beyond 1–2 years. Prostate tumors become resistant and continue to grow in the presence of low levels of androgens. Moreover, antiandrogens given to antagonize residual androgen action lose their efficacy as antagonists and eventually function as agonists to promote AR-mediated growth of prostate cancer cells. Using transient transfection and reporter gene assays we demonstrated that overexpression of dARA70N helped to abolish the agonist activity and rescued the antagonist effect of antiandrogens or other non-androgenic molecules in prostate cancer cells. We designed experimental conditions that closely mimicked conditions of maximum androgen ablation therapy. Prostate cancer patients may have minimal serum concentrations of androgens (0.1 nm DHT) and a relatively high level of antiandrogens (1–5 μm) during maximal ablation therapy. LNCaP cells were transfected with dARA70N or ARA70N, and after 24 h of androgen/antiandrogen treatment in the above conditions, cells were harvested and assayed for AR transcriptional activity. As depicted in Fig. 4A, HF and E2 increased AR activity, functioning as agonists in ARA70-expressed LNCaP cells (lanes 6, 8, 13, and 15). In the presence of 0.1 nm DHT, these molecules failed to antagonize or block androgen actions in the cells (lanes 7, 9, 14, and 16). However, overexpression of dARA70N reduced this agonist activity (lanes 10 and 17) and effectively rescued the antagonist effect of these antiandrogens in LNCaP cells (lanes 11 and 18). This rescue by the dARA70N was well reflected in the diminished expression of PSA in the cells as measured by Western blot analysis. As depicted in Fig. 4B, both E2 and HF by themselves increased PSA expression (lanes 5 and 11). In conditions of maximal androgen ablation therapy, these drugs increased (instead of decreased) PSA expression in the cells (lanes 6 and 12). Although LNCaP cells express endogenous ARA70, transfection of ARA70N further increases (lanes 7, 8, 13, and 14), whereas dARA70N significantly diminished PSA expression in the cells (lanes 9–10 and 15–16). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that AR expression is essential for PSA induction, and an addition of dARA70N will inactivate endogenous ARA70 function, resulting in antiandrogens having less agonist activity in the LNCaP cells. RNAi-mediated Silencing of ARA70 Gene Inhibits AR Transactivation and Reduces the Agonist Activity of Antiandrogens in Prostate Cancer Cell—To further confirm these roles of ARA70 on the AR transactivation and on the agonist activity of antiandrogens, we investigated the effect of RNAi-mediated ARA70 gene silencing in LNCaP cells. We constructed three RNAi constructs (Fig. 5A) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Although all three constructs showed inhibitory effects, the construct A was most effective in inhibiting exogenously expressed ARA70 and AR transactivation in COS-1 cells (data not shown). To see whether the construct A could silence endogenous ARA70 and thereby could inhibit endogenous AR function, we transfected it into PC-3(AR)2 cells, which express both ARA70 and AR. As depicted in Fig. 5B, RNAi-A construct inhibited endogenous AR function in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 4–5). Western blot analysis using cell lysates from PC-3(AR)2 cells transfected with RNAi-A confirmed the silencing of the ARA70 gene"
https://openalex.org/W2090073257,"Lens epithelium-cell derived growth factor (LEDGF) is a transcriptional activator. It protects the cells by binding to cis-stress response ((A/T)GGGG(T/A)), and heat shock (HSE; nGAAn) elements in the stress genes and activating their transcription. Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has been implicated in the control of tissue homeostasis, terminal differentiation, and apoptosis. Here we provide evidence that TGF-β1 down-regulates LEDGF expression and diminishes its affinity for DNA during TGF-β1-induced phenotypic changes and apoptosis in human lens epithelial cells. Surprisingly, TGF-β1 treatment for 48 h markedly decreased the LEDGF, Hsp27, and αB-crystallin promoter activities with the decrease of abundance of LEDGF mRNA and protein. Deletion mutants of the LEDGF promoter showed that one TGF-β1 inhibitory element (TIE) like sequence nnnTTGGnnn (–444 to –433) contributed to this negative regulation. Mutation of TIE (TTGG to TATT) abolished the down-regulation of the LEDGF promoter. Gel mobility and supershift assays showed that LEDGF in the nuclear extracts of TGF-β1-treated human lens epithelial cells did not bind to stress-response elements and HSE. The TGF-β1-induced down-regulation of LEDGF, Hsp27, and αB-crystallin promoters activity was reversed by cotransfection with a plasmid expressing LEDGF. Because overexpression of LEDGF was able to relieve TGF-β1 and/or stress-induced changes, it would be a candidate molecule to postpone age-related degenerating disorders.

A variety of cells express the TGF-β receptor. The presence of TGF-β receptors (TGF-β RI and RII) has been monitored in lens tissue (10de Iongh R.U. Lovicu F.J. Overbeek P.A. Schneider M.D. Joya J.

Borisuth N.S. Am. J. Anat. 1991; 192: 442-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), has been shown to induce cataracts at relatively high concentrations (12Hales A.M. Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1709-1713PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, McAvoy and co-workers (13Liu J. Hales A.M. Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 388-401PubMed Google Scholar) reported that TGF-β1 could induce cataractous changes in rat lens epithelial explants. These include the formation of spindle-shaped cells, accumulation of extracellular matrix, and cell death with features of apoptosis (14Chuang L.Y. Hung W.C. Chang C.C. Tsai J.H.

Some or all of these changes are typically found in the human subcapsular cataract, both the anterior and posterior forms and after the cataract (posterior capsular opacification). Two molecular markers for these forms of cataract, α-smooth muscle actin and type I collagen, are induced (16Hales A.M. Schulz M.W. Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Curr.

It is found at low levels in most actively dividing cells. Cells expressing higher level of LEDGF survive remarkably well against a wide variety of stress (17Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Chylack Jr., L.T.

LEDGF binds to the stress-related element (STRE; consensus sequence ((A/T)GGGG(A/T)) and the heat shock element (HSE; consensus sequence nGAAn) present in the stress-associated genes and up-regulates their transcriptions (22Fatma N.

Progression of disease such as aging or cataractogenesis is driven by the progressive effects of environmental or physiological stresses, including growth factors and their subsequent effect on sequential suppression of counteracting gene products, and at each stage in the progression, sequence suppression in growth regulatory genes and/or attenuation of antioxidant agents may occur. Thus, the unique pressure is being placed on lens epithelial cells that normally involve the induction of cataractogenesis by attenuating the function of survival factors. LEDGF is a survival factor, and its deactivation by UV or H2O2 or TGF-β may down-regulate Hsp27 and αB-crystallin. Thus we hypothesized that during cell death and/or cataractogenesis, the LEDGF gene or its gene product is attenuated. TGF-β1 induced apoptosis in various cell types including hLECs (14Chuang L.Y.

Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 915-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) that LEDGF contained three cleavage sites for caspase-3 and -7.

(30Kerr L.D. Miller D.B. Matrisian L.M. Cell. 1990; 61: 267-278Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar) have shown that a 10-bp element in the transin promoter is required for the TGF-β1 inhibitory effects and that this sequence is conserved in the promoter regions of several other TGF-β1-inhibited genes. TIE specifically binds to a nuclear protein complex from TGF-β1-rat fibroblast, and this complex contained the c-fos proto-oncogene product, Fos, and induction of Fos expression was required for the inhibitory effect of TGF-β1 on gene expression (30Kerr L.D.

Because LEDGF gene expression is inhibited in hLECs treated with TGF-β1, we predict that LEDGF promoter bears TIE. An analysis of the LEDGF promoter revealed that it has various regulatory elements as follows: heat shock and stress-response elements, VDR/RXR (vitamin D receptor/retinoid X receptor), STAT, E2F, OCT1, GRE, SP1, GATA-1, IRF-1 and IRF-2, etc. (46Singh D.P. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 265-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 47Singh D.P. Fatma N. Sharma P. Hayakawa K. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2002; 2345: 342Google Scholar), including the TIE sites at –444 to –433 from the transcription start site. In the studies presented here, we examined the regulation of LEDGF expression by TGF-β1 in hLECs, and we have shown it as a model to study the TGF-β1-mediated insults in hLECs or lenses that may lead to a type of cataractogenesis. We demonstrated that TGF-β1 induced phenotypic changes, expression of α smooth muscle actin (α sm-actin), suppression of Hsps in hLECs, and also apoptosis, and that these changes were associated with the repression of transcription and reduction of protein of LEDGF. Thus, this investigation addresses the mechanism by which TGF-β1 inhibits the LEDGF gene, and our findings add weight to the hypothesis that LEDGF plays a regulatory role in determining the fate of hLECs. Cell Culture—Human lens epithelial cells (hLECs) (a gift of Dr. V. N. Reddy) were maintained routinely in our laboratory following the method as described elsewhere (48Ibaraki N. Chen S.C. Lin L.R. Okamoto H. Pipas J.M. Reddy V.N. Exp. Eye Res. 1998; 67: 577-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured in a 75-mm tissue culture flask in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μg/ml penicillin in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C following the standard methods. Cells were trypsinized (0.25%) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm EDTA-Na to separate them from the bottom of the flask and plated at a density of 5 × 105 in 60-mm plates or 1 × 106 in 100-mm plates depending on the experiment. To examine the effect of TGF-β1 on hLECs, cells were plated (5 × 105/well) in 6-well plates (Falcon) and cultured in complete medium (DMEM + 20% FBS). 24 h later, the cells were washed twice with DMEM without FBS and treated with TGF-β1 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) at different concentrations (5.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25 ng/ml in 0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 24 and 48 h. MTS, DAPI staining, and photomicrography of hLECs were performed after TGF-β1 treatment, and the results were recorded. Cell Survival Assay (MTS Assay)—A colorimetric MTS assay (Promega) was performed as described by Barltrop and Owen (49Barltrop J.A. Owen T.C. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1991; 11: 611-614Crossref Scopus (371) Google Scholar). This colorimetric assay of cellular proliferation uses 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2 to 4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt (MTS; Promega, Madison, MI), when added to medium containing viable cells, and MTS is reduced to a water-soluble formazan salt. The absorbance at 490 nm was measured after 4 h with an ELISA reader. DAPI Staining—DAPI staining was done as described by Bonifacino et al. (50Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Morgan K.S. Current Protocols in Cell Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1999: 8.4.5-8.4.8Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in complete medium overnight, and the next day, cells were washed and treated with TGF-β1. Untreated culture was served as control. After treatment for 24 h, cells were washed once with PBS and were fixed in 70% ethanol. Cells were washed with PBS and thereafter incubated in DAPI solution for 30 min at room temperature, washed, and mounted. The morphology of the nuclei of the cell was observed under a fluorescent microscope at UV excitation at 350 nm. After photomicrography, apoptotic nuclei were identified by condensed chromatin gathering at the periphery of the nuclear membrane or a total fragmented morphology of nuclear bodies. Untreated culture was also photographed that served as control. TUNEL Staining—TUNEL staining was carried out using in situ cell death detection kit, fluorescein (Roche Diagnostics) following the company's protocol. Briefly, TGF-β1-treated and -untreated cells were washed with PBS and fixed in freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4), followed by incubation in permeabilization solution (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate) for 2 min on ice. Cells were rinsed twice with PBS and incubate in TUNEL reaction mixture for 60 min at 37 °C in the dark. Cells were rinsed with PBS three times, and after mounting, samples were micro-photographed using a microscope (Nikon, ECLIPSE TE 300) and analyzed. The percentage of apoptotic cells per total cells (100 cells) in each 5 fields per slide was determined from two independent experiments. Western Blot Analysis—Western analysis was performed following the methods of Singh et al. (17Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1444-1451PubMed Google Scholar) and Hales et al. (16Hales A.M. Schulz M.W. Chamberlain C.G. McAvoy J.W. Curr. Eye Res. 1994; 13: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Cells treated with or without TGF-β1 (1 and 5 ng/ml) were washed three times with PBS, harvested, and lysed in RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS in PBS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics)). Cells were disrupted in a syringe fitted with a 21-gauge needle, and the cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Protein samples were prepared in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ImmobilonTM-P, Millipore Corp, Bedford, MA), and blocking was done with 5% nonfat dry milk in 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS and then incubated overnight at 4 °C either with mouse monoclonal antibody to LEDGF (BD Biosciences) as primary antibody at 1:1000 dilution or with mouse anti-α sm-actin at 1:400 dilution (Sigma). The filters were washed three times with PBS-T and incubated with anti-mouse IgG labeled with horseradish peroxidase (1:1500 dilution) as a second antibody. The specific protein band was then visualized by incubating the membrane with luminol reagent (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and exposing the membrane to film (X-Omat, Eastman Kodak Co.). To ascertain comparative expression and equal loading of these protein samples, the membrane stained earlier with anti-LEDGF monoclonal antibody was stripped and reprobed with α sm-actin antibody. Construction of LEDGF in Eukaryotic Expression Vector—A construct containing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and LEDGF cDNA was generated with the “living color system” (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using the plasmid vector pEGFP-C1 (GFP-vector) for eukaryotic expression (17Singh D.P. Ohguro N. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1999; 40: 1444-1451PubMed Google Scholar). This construct was used to generate stable eukaryotic cells that overexpressed LEDGF (GFP-LEDGF). Cells transfected with the empty vector served as a control. Reverse Transcription-PCR—RT-PCR was conducted following the method as reported earlier (23Sharma P. Singh D.P. Fatma N. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1320-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, we synthesized the primers specific to TGF-β RI and RII and used them in this study. To perform RT-PCR, either total RNA or mRNA was extracted from hLECs after treatment with or without TGF-β1 (1 ng/ml). Total RNA was extracted using the single step guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (Trizol Reagent; Invitrogen), and mRNA was isolated with the Micro-Fast TrackTM kit (Invitrogen) from 5 × 105 hLECs. The Micro-fast track 2 (Invitrogen), a cDNA synthesis kit for RT-PCR, was used to synthesize cDNA from mRNA. The resulting cDNA was used for different cycles in PCR. After denaturation for 2 min at 95 °C, 30 cycles of PCR amplification (denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 3 min) were carried out, followed by a final extension for 7 min at 72 °C. The sequences of oligonucleotide probes were as follows: TGF-β RI sense primer, 5′-CAC CTG GCC TTG GTC CTG TG-3′, and antisense primer, 5′-CCT CAC GGA ACC ACG AAC GTT generating a 396-bp, TGF-β RII sense primer, 5′-CAG AGA AGG ACA TCT TCT CAG GAC-3′, and TGFβ RII antisense primer, 5′-CTC CCA CTG CAT TAC AGC GAG ATG-3′ generating a 484-bp fragment, were used. Northern Blot (RNA) Analysis—Total RNA was extracted from hLECs with or without treatment of TGF-β1 for different time intervals using the single step guanidine thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (Trizol Reagent; Invitrogen), and mRNA was isolated with the mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 10 μg of poly(A)-RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis through a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel. RNA was transferred to a Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized using Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Biosciences) to an 846-bp EcoRI-XhoI restriction fragment from 3′-LEDGF cDNA. The probe was labeled by using the NEBlot® Kit using Random Primers (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Prehybridization was performed at 65 °C for 1 h, and hybridization were conducted at 65 °C for 4 h following the company protocols. Membranes were washed and autoradiographed. Membranes were exposed for autoradiography on x-ray film (Fugi X-Ray) at –70 °C with an intensifying screen for 16 h. The filter from this experiment was stripped and used to reprobe with a p32-labeled GAPDH probe (Ambion). Preparation of Lens Epithelial Cell Nuclear Extract—Human lens epithelial cell nuclear extract was prepared as described earlier (22Fatma N. Singh D.P. Shinohara T. Chylack Jr., L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48899-48907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) with certain modifications. Briefly, human LECs (1 × 106) were cultured in 100-mm culture plates. The cells treated with or without TGF-β1 (1 and 5 ng/ml) were washed gently with chilled PBS (pH 7.2). Cells were collected by centrifugation and resuspended in 5 pellet volumes of cytoplasmic extract buffer (10 mm HEPES, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.075% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, adjusted to pH 7.6). After a short incubation on ice, the cytoplasmic extract was removed from the pellet. Following careful washing with cytoplasmic extract buffer without detergent (Nonidet P-40), the fragile nuclei were resuspended in nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2% EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25% (v/v) glycerol, adjusted to pH 8.0). Salt concentration was adjusted to 400 mm using 5 m NaCl, and the extract was incubated on ice for 10 min with occasional vortexing. Finally, the extract was spun at 14,000 rpm for 30 min to pellet the nuclei. After dialysis, protein was estimated according to the Bradford method (51Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar), and the extract was used for EMSA. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—LEDGF physically and functionally binds to HSE and STRE (25Singh D.P. Fatma N. Kimura A. Chylack Jr., L.T. Shinohara T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 283: 943-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In the present study, we performed EMSA with nuclear extracts from hLECs with or without treatment with TGF-β1 to understand whether TGF-β1 attenuates the DNA binding property of LEDGF. For this, oligonucleotides having HSE (nGAAn) and STRE ((T/A)GGGG(A/T)) were synthesized chemically (Invitrogen). Sequences were annealed and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Inc.). The binding reaction was performed in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 75 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of poly(dI/dC). Five fmol (1000 cpm) of the end-labeled probe was incubated on ice for 30 min with 5 μg of nuclear extract. Samples were then loaded on 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer"
https://openalex.org/W2006799527,"Although remodeling of vessels can dramatically alter lumen diameter and clinical sequelae, the molecular mechanisms regulating extracellular matrix turnover and remodeling are still not well understood. To investigate these processes in human smooth muscle, we have compared their culture on monomer and polymerized collagen gels, conditions that mimic some of the features of injured and normal vessels, respectively. We show that culture on polymerized, but not monomer, collagen leads to the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB through phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitor, IκBα. Coincident with NF-κB activation, expression of MMP1, MMP2, and α2 integrin increases on polymerized collagen. Specific inhibition of NF-κB by retroviral overexpression of wild-type IκBα or phosphorylation-resistant, IκBα-stabilized mutant (IκBαSer32,36/Ala) reverses the increases in MMP1 and α2β1 on polymerized collagen and decreases collagen gel contraction and degradation. However, forced overexpression of α2β1 integrin or MMP1 in smooth muscle cells expressing IκBαSer32,36/Ala rescues their ability to contract collagen gels. Thus, polymerized collagen induces NF-κB-dependent expression of MMP1 and α2β1 integrin, that are required for smooth muscle extracellular matrix remodeling.

It is becoming clear that such remodeling involves dynamic interactions between resident cells and their matrix environment, but relatively little is known about the transcriptional programs by which ECM remodeling occurs. In vitro, fibroblasts cultured on free floating collagen gels can exert enough force to condense the matrix into dense organized structures thought to mimic some aspects of wound contraction (1Grinnell F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 401-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). In this system, the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), is activated, and one of its downstream target genes, α2 integrin, is required for gel contraction (2Schiro J.A. Chan B.M. Roswit W.T. Kassner P.D. Pentland A.P. Hemler M.E. Eisen A.Z. Kupper T.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 403-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Additionally, the expression of proteases involved in matrix degradation, including matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP1) and 3 (MMP 13), are also upregulated in fibroblasts cultured on polymerized collagen gels (3Langholz O. Rockel D. Mauch C. Kozlowska E. Bank I. Krieg T. Eckes B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1903-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). These findings have suggested that the activation of specific transcription factors, and therefore transcriptional programs, likely play an important role in ECM remodeling. In support of this, it has been shown that a peptide inhibitor of NF-κB reduces induction of α2 integrin by polymerized collagen and the ability of fibroblasts to contract collagen gels (4Xu J. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Clark R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 709-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). ECM remodeling is thought to be an important step in the pathogenesis of several vascular diseases including atherosclerosis and post-angioplasty restenosis (5Faxon D.P. Coats W. Currier J. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1997; 40: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In response to injury and to changes in blood pressure and flow, the ECM of the vessel wall can be extensively remodeled by vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Similar to fibroblasts, adhesive events have been shown to regulate the activity of NF-κB in human SMCs in vitro. For example, adhesion of SMCs to fibronectincoated dishes activates NF-κB (6Qwarnstrom E.E. Ostberg C.O. Turk G.L. Richardson C.A. Bomsztyk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30765-30768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but serum and growth factors also induce NF-κB activation (7Bourcier T. Sukhova G. Libby P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15817-15824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Activated NF-κB is detected in intimal and medial SMCs in lesions of atherosclerosis, but not in healthy vessels (8Brand K. Page S. Rogler G. Bartsch A. Brandl R. Knuechel R. Page M. Kaltschmidt C. Baeuerle P.A. Neumeier D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1715-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). NF-κB immunostaining is also increased after balloon injury (9Lindner V. Pathobiology. 1998; 66: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and in coronary atherosclerotic plaques of patients with unstable angina (10Wilson S.H. Best P.J. Edwards W.D. Holmes Jr., D.R. Carlson P.J. Celermajer D.S. Lerman A. Atherosclerosis. 2002; 160: 147-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). More significantly, blockade of NF-κB by adenoviral expression of its inhibitor, IκBα, after balloon dilation of the rabbit iliac artery reduces lumen narrowing as measured by angiography and morphometry (11Breuss J.M. Cejna M. Bergmeister H. Kadl A. Baumgartl G. Steurer S. Xu Z. Koshelnick Y. Lipp J. De Martin R. Losert U. Lammer J. Binder B.R. Circulation. 2002; 105: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). IκBα expression decreases macrophage recruitment and increases SMC apoptosis compared with control-treated contralateral vessels (11Breuss J.M. Cejna M. Bergmeister H. Kadl A. Baumgartl G. Steurer S. Xu Z. Koshelnick Y. Lipp J. De Martin R. Losert U. Lammer J. Binder B.R. Circulation. 2002; 105: 633-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Despite these in vivo effects, the role of NF-κB in ECM remodeling by vascular SMCs is not known. In the current study, we have examined the effects of polymerized collagen gels on NF-κB activation in human aortic SMCs. Our experiments show that polymerized collagen, but not monomer collagen, specifically activates NF-κB through phosphorylation and degradation of the endogenous NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα. Retroviral overexpression of IκBα or a nondegradable phosphorylation-resistent IκBα-mutant significantly suppresses NF-κB activation and blocks collagen gel contraction by SMCs. In addition, we demonstrate that NF-κB activation is required for the induction of MMP1 and α2 integrin, which contribute to collagen degradation and remodeling. Overexpression of either of these two NF-κB gene products can rescue blockade of collagen gel contraction by IκBα overexpression, thus establishing a central role for NF-κB in vascular remodeling. Cell Culture and Collagen Matrix Preparation—Human newborn arterial SMCs were isolated from the thoracic aorta as previously described (12Bornfeldt K.E. Raines E.W. Nakano T. Graves L.M. Krebs E.G. Ross R. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). SMCs between passages 5 and 9 were cultured in 1% PDS (plasma-derived serum)/DMEM (Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium) on the surface of the following collagen type I preparations: polymerized collagen gels (1.0 mg/ml final concentration) prepared by neutralization of the collagen solution (Vitrogen 100, Collagen Corporation) with one-sixth volume of 7× concentrated DMEM, dilution to a final 1× DMEM solution, and incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. Monomer collagen-coated dishes were prepared by incubating 0.1 mg/ml collagen solution in 0.1 m acetic acid at 37 °C for 24 h and washed twice with DMEM before cell seeding. To alter cell adhesiveness to plastic, tissue culture dishes were coated with a concentration of poly (HEMA), or hydron polymer (200 μl per well of a 12% solution in 95% ethanol, Interferon Sciences, Inc.), that was previously used to study the effect of cell shape on growth (13Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). Inhibitors and Antibodies—26 S proteasome inhibitor N-p-tosyl-l-phenylalanine (TPCK) was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. and the broad-based metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 from Elastin Products Co. The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-IκBα and phospho-IκBα (New England Biolabs); rabbit polyclonal anti-p50 and anti-p65 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); mouse monoclonal anti-MMP1 and anti-MMP2 (Calbiochem); mouse monoclonal anti-α2 integrin (P1H5 and P1H6) and mouse monoclonal anti-β1 integrin (P4C10) provided by W. G. Carter (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA); rabbit polyclonal anti-α2 (Chemicon); rabbit polyclonal anti-β1 integrin (160) provided by R. O. Hynes (M. I. T., Cambridge, MA); mouse monoclonal anti-α5 integrin (Transduction Laboratories); mouse monoclonal anti-α-actin (Sigma); and anti-CD8 PE (phycoerythrin)-conjugated (BD PharMingen). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift and Luciferase Reporter Assays—Gel shift assays were performed as previously described (14Levkau B. Garton K.J. Ferri N. Kloke K. Nofer J.R. Baba H.A. Raines E.W. Breithardt G. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Cells cultured on monomer collagen were trypsinized, washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer A (10 mm Hepes pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) and allowed to swell on ice for 20 min. SMCs cultured on polymerized collagen were incubated with 2.5 mg/ml of collagenase type I (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) for 15 min at 37 °C. The cell suspension was then washed with PBS and resuspended in buffer A as indicated above. The nuclei were separated from the cell lysates by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. This nuclear pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of buffer C (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A) and incubated for 20 min on ice. The lysed nuclei were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. The nuclear extracts were assayed for protein content using the Bio-Rad BCA assay method. The binding reaction was carried out at room temperature for 15 min mixing 10 μg of nuclear extracts with 50,000 cpm of labeled probe, 4 μl of 5× binding buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 0.25 m NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA pH 8.0, Ficoll Powder 1.5%, w/v) and 4 μg of poly(dIdC·dIdC) (to prevent nonspecific binding). The samples were run on a 6% nondenaturing acrylamide gel. After running, the gels were dried, and bands were detected by autoradiography. For the supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), the binding reactions were incubated with 1 μg of normal IgG or antibody recognizing NF-κB subunits (p65 and p50) for 15 min at room temperature before loading the sample on the gel. For the luciferase reporter assay, SMC were infected with pBM-SIN-κB-luciferase, cultured on monomer or polymerized collagen for indicated periods of time, and resuspended by either trypsinization or collagenase treatment, respectively. Luciferase activity was measured using a luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Collagen Gel Contraction Assay and Collagen Degradation Assay— SMCs were incubated for 48 h in 1% PDS/DMEM, then trypsinized and seeded on the surface of polymerized collagen type I (1 × 106/35-mm Petri dishes). After 24 h the gel was detached from the bottom of the dish by the pipetting medium underneath the gel. Images were captured using Laboratory Imaging System (UVP) after 24, 48, and 72 h. The areas were calculated using NIH Image 1.59 software. For the collagen degradation assay, SMCs were cultured on fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated polymerized collagen (Elastin Products Co., 1.0 mg/ml final concentration), and conditioned media were collected at 24-h intervals and FITC-conjugated collagen fragments were measured using a Cyto Fluor Multi-Well Plate Reader (PerSeptive Biosystems). Generation of Expression Constructs and Retroviral Infection—All constructs were generated using standard molecular biology techniques. IκBα and IκBαSer32,36/Ala were generated as previously described (14Levkau B. Garton K.J. Ferri N. Kloke K. Nofer J.R. Baba H.A. Raines E.W. Breithardt G. Circ. Res. 2001; 88: 282-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Full-length human MMP1 was generated by PCR using primers containing a 5′ XhoI site and 3′ NotI site for subcloning into the retroviral vector. α2 integrin cDNA was generated by PCR using primers containing a 5′ XhoI site, and a 3′ HA epitope tag with a NotI site for subcloning into retroviral vectors. The sequences of all PCR-generated constructs were confirmed. Primer sequences used for cloning are available upon request. All retroviral expression plasmids were constructed using the internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) vector pBMIRES-EGFP, generously provided by G. P. Nolan (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and pBM-IRES-PURO expressing the puromycin resistance gene (PAC) as a selectable second cistron gene (15Garton K.J. Ferri N. Raines E.W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1-7Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). An NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter cassette (Clontech) was subcloned into a multiple cloning site of the retroviral vector pBM-SIN (kindly provided by G. P. Nolan) to yield the pBM-SIN-κB-luciferase reporter retroviral vector. High titer retrovirus was prepared as previously described (16Kinoshita S. Su L. Amano M. Timmerman L.A. Kaneshima H. Nolan G.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 235-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For infection, SMCs were incubated 48 h in 1% PDS/DMEM and then trypsinized and plated into 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks in 10% fetal calf serum/DMEM (1.5 × 106/flask). After 24 h the media were replaced with 10 ml of virus stock for 12 h in the presence of 4 μg/ml polybrene (Sigma). After infection, retroviral supernatant was replaced with fresh 10% fetal calf serum/DMEM, and cells were cultured for at least 4 days before use in subsequent experiments. Infection efficiencies were determined by analyzing expression of EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) retroviral reporter gene by flow cytometry. Protein Analysis—Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 100 μl of buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) for 30 min on ice. Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). Lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore) and subsequently immunoblotted with specific antibodies, prior to visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Quantitative densitometric analyses were performed using Lab Works Image Acquisition and analysis software (UVP, Inc.). Flow Cytometry—Cell surface levels of α2 and β1 integrin were determined after dissolution of polymerized collagen by incubation with collagenase type I as described above. Cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min, washed with PBS, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. After fixation, cells were stained with mouse monoclonal antibodies, anti-β1 integrin (P4C10) or -α2 integrin (P1H5), followed by PE-conjugated secondary antibody. α2 and β1 integrin expression was measured by flow cytometry, using a FACScanTM (Becton Dickinson) and data analysis with CellQuest software. Gelatin Zymography—Cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer as described above, and conditioned media were collected from SMC cultures. Samples were prepared in nonreducing loading buffer and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel containing 1 mg/ml of gelatin. After electrophoresis, gels were washed three times in washing solution (150 mm NaCl and 2.5% Triton X-100) for 30 min, rinsed in water, and incubated 12–16 h in collagenase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2). Gels were subsequently fixed and stained in Coomassie Blue fixative solution (25% methanol, 7% acetic acid, and 0.25% Coomassie Blue R250, Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature and destained with washing solution (25% methanol and 7% methanol in water) for 4–5 h. Statistical Analyses—All data shown are representative of three replicate experiments unless otherwise noted. Data are presented as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used to evaluate differences between groups, and statistical significance was assigned when p < 0.05. Polymerized Collagen Gel, but Not Monomer Collagen, Specifically Induces NF-κB Activation—We have previously shown that polymerized type I collagen can modulate SMC phenotype (17Raines E.W. Koyama H. Carragher N.O. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 902 (Discussion, 51–32): 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and proliferation (18Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of collagen on the activation of NF-κB in human SMCs, we compared SMCs cultured on monomer versus polymerized type I collagen. Total cellular levels of the p105/p50 NF-κB subunits appear modestly reduced (77.5% ± 45.9 for p105 and 76.7% ± 50.9 for p50) on polymerized collagen as compared with monomer collagen, but the differences are not statistically significant in SMCs (Fig. 1A). However, polymerized collagen induces nuclear translocation (4.4 ± 1.6-fold) of the p50 NF-κB subunit (Fig. 1B). Although SMCs exhibit high constitutive NF-κB transcriptional activity (19Lawrence R. Chang L.J. Siebenlist U. Bressler P. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28913-28918Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), gel shift analysis shows that polymerized, but not monomer, collagen leads to approximately a 2.25 ± 0.52 increase (n = 4) in the DNA binding activity of NF-κB (Fig. 1C). NF-κB activation is observed as early as 1 h after plating SMCs on polymerized collagen and is sustained for 24 h (data not shown). Supershift analysis reveals that the slower migrating NF-κB complex consists of a p50/p65 heterodimer, whereas the faster migrating complex contains a p50/p50 homodimer, both of which are induced on polymerized collagen (Fig. 1C). Activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription was confirmed using a reporter construct that shows a 3.7 ± 1.3-fold increase (n = 5 independent experiments) in expression of a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter gene when SMCs are cultured on polymerized collagen (Fig. 1D). Increased NF-κB-dependent transcription is observed as early as 4 h and sustained for at least 12 h after exposure to polymerized collagen (Fig. 1D). Similar results were observed with two different human SMC strains (data not shown). Although cell shape and focal adhesion formation are also altered on polymerized collagen (18Koyama H. Raines E.W. Bornfeldt K.E. Roberts J.M. Ross R. Cell. 1996; 87: 1069-1078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar), cell rounding and cytoskeletal disruption induced by cytochalisin D or colchicine does not lead to activation of NF-κB-dependent transcription (data not shown). Moreover, cell rounding induced by altering cell adhesiveness to plastic with poly (HEMA), a polymer originally used to examine the role of cell shape in growth control (13Folkman J. Moscona A. Nature. 1978; 273: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar), induces only a 2.3-fold induction of NF-κB activation that does not quite reach statistical significance (p = 0.06) at a concentration of poly (HEMA) where the SMCs appear totally rounded (Fig. 1E). In contrast, polymerized collagen induces a highly significant 5.9-fold increase in NF-κB activation in the same cells (Fig. 1E). Further, NF-κB-dependent luciferase expression is induced 3.7 ± 1.3-fold for SMCs on floating (data not shown) or attached polymerized collagen gels (Fig. 1, D and E). Therefore, the activation of NF-κB by polymerized collagen in SMCs is not simply due to a change in cell shape and/or tensional forces exerted between cells and the ECM. Retroviral Expression of IκBα and IκBα Dominant-negative (IκBαSer32,36/Ala) Inhibits NF-κB Activation Induced by Polymerized Collagen—Activation of NF-κB is thought to be regulated in large part by phosphorylation and subsequent proteosome-dependent degradation of the NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα (20May M.J. Ghosh S. Science. 1999; 284: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 21Winston J.T. Strack P. Beer-Romero P. Chu C.Y. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 270-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of SMCs plated on polymerized collagen demonstrates a rapid and sustained decrease (25% ± 13 as compared with monomer) in the levels of IκBα (Fig. 2A). Preincubation of SMCs with the proteasome inhibitor TPCK (10 μm) blocks IκBα degradation in response to polymerized collagen (data not shown), suggesting that NF-κB activation in response to polymerized collagen is mediated by IκBα degradation by the 26 S proteasome (22Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). To determine whether IκBα phosphorylation and degradation are required for NF-κB activation by polymerized collagen, SMCs were infected with an IRES-EGFP retrovirus encoding either wild-type IκBα, a phosphorylation-resistant IκBα mutant (IκBαSer32,36/Ala) with increased stability (22Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben-Neriah Y. Baeuerle P.A. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), or an empty vector control. Western blot analysis of detergent cell extracts confirms that IκBα is expressed ∼5–10-fold above endogenous levels after retroviral infection and is not significantly down-regulated in response to polymerized collagen (Fig. 2B). By gel shift analysis, overexpression of either IκBα or IκBαSer32,36/Ala results in a marked inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity in cells plated on monomer or polymerized collagen (Fig. 2C). As expected, the degradation-resistant IκBαSer32,36/Ala mutant leads to a more pronounced inhibition of NF-κB DNA binding activity. The residual level of NF-κB activation is consistent with the fact that ∼20–30% of the cells were not infected with the IκBα-overexpressing retrovirus, as determined by flow cytometry analysis of the EGFP reporter (data not shown). To more specifically analyze the effect of the IκBαSer32,36/Ala mutant at the transcription level, we sequentially superinfected human SMCs with NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter retrovirus, and IRES-PURO retrovirus encoding IκBαSer32,36/Ala and the selectable puromycin resistance gene (PAC). Use of the PAC in the IRES-based retroviral vector allows rapid selection of a population with 100% infection efficiency (15Garton K.J. Ferri N. Raines E.W. BioTechniques. 2002; 32: 1-7Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In SMCs on polymerized collagen, overexpression of IκBαSer32,36/Ala leads to a 70–80% inhibition of NF-κB-dependent transcriptional activity to a level equal to, or slightly lower than, control cells on monomer collagen (Fig. 2D). NF-κB Transcriptional Activity Regulates Collagen Gel Contraction and Expression of α2β1Integrin and Collagenase Type I in SMCs—SMC remodeling of the ECM can include contraction of the matrix through integrins, breakdown of the matrix by MMPs, and/or synthesis of new matrix (23Galis Z.S. Khatri J.J. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (1664) Google Scholar). SMCs overexpressing IκBα or IκBαSer32,36/Ala almost completely lose their ability to remodel floating collagen gels after 24–48 h, compared with control cells (Fig. 3, A and B). On polymerized collagen, human SMCs upregulate MMP1 (Fig. 4A) and activate MMP2 as early as 6 h after being plated (data not shown). Culture of SMCs on polymerized collagen for 24–48 h also increases expression of α2 integrin, by Western blot analysis (data not shown).Fig. 4NF-κB transcriptional activity regulates α2β1 integrin and MMP1 expression. Human SMC were infected with pBM-IRES-EGFP retrovirus-encoding control vector, IκBα, or IκBαSer32,36/Ala, then plated on monomer (M) and polymerized (P) collagen for 24 h. A, MMP1 expression was analyzed from total cell lysates and conditioned media by Western blotting, and MMP2 expression and processing were analyzed from conditioned media by gelatin zymography. B, SMCs were harvested by incubation with 2.5 mg/ml of collagenase type I. α2 and β1 integrin expression was measured by flow cytometry and compared with SMCs infected with pBM-IRES-EGFP and analyzed with normal IgG.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether NF-κB transcriptional activity is required for the expression of MMPs and integrins in human SMCs plated on monomer versus polymerized collagen, we evaluated the effect of retroviral expression of IκBα or IκBαSer32,36/Ala. Overexpression of either inhibitor markedly down-regulates MMP1 expression in SMCs plated on either monomer or polymerized collagen (Fig. 4A). Although polymerized collagen still induces expression of MMP1 in the conditioned media and cell lysates of SMCs overexpressing IκBαSer32,36/Ala, the levels achieved are almost comparable to control EGFP transduced cells plated on monomer collagen (81.3% ± 1.5 and 86.2% ± 3.9, respectively). Importantly, this response exactly mirrors the levels of NF-κB DNA binding activity seen after plating SMCs on monomer and polymerized collagen (Fig. 2C). In contrast, IκBα and IκBαSer32,36/Ala overexpression does not inhibit either the activation or the expression of MMP2 by polymerized collagen (Fig. 4A and data not shown). IκBα or IκBαSer32,36/Ala overexpression also decreases cell surface levels of α2 and β1 integrin (Fig. 4B), but does not alter the expression of α5 integrin or its down-regulation by polymerized collagen (data not shown). MMP1 and α2Integrin Expression Are Sufficient to Restore Collagen Gel Contraction in SMCs with NF-κB Blockade—To evaluate whether MMP and integrin activity are required for collagen gel contraction, we examined the effect of the broad spectrum metalloproteinase inhibitor GM6001 and blocking or non-blocking α2 integrin antibodies on collagen gel contraction by SMCs. The incubation of SMCs with 50 μm GM6001 leads to a 40% decrease in collagen gel contraction (Fig. 5A). In the presence of blocking (P1H5), but not of non-blocking (P1H6) α2 integrin antibodies, there is a dose-dependent inhibition of collagen gel contraction (Fig. 5B). Therefore, α2β1 integrin action at the cell surface as well as MMP activity are important for collagen contraction by SMCs. NF-κB involvement in collagen degradation was evaluated by plating SMCs on FITC-labeled collagen (Fig. 6A). Overexpression of IκBαSer32,36/Ala significantly inhibits collagen release, while the broad-based M"

The first step of the urea-induced unfolding produced an intermediate, which then unfolded at higher concentrations of urea. The intermediate state contains native-like secondary structure and much less tertiary structure compared with the native state. It is distinct from the native state as well as from the unfolded state. Similar to urea-induced unfolding of FtsZ, thermal unfolding of FtsZ also occurs in two steps. The midpoints for the first and second thermal unfolding transitions were found to be 38 ± 4 and 77 ± 5 °C, respectively. Further, the functional properties of FtsZ are extremely sensitive to urea, guanidium chloride, and sodium dodecyl sulfate. For example, 50% inhibition of the FtsZ assembly and GTP hydrolysis occurred at 0.1 and 0.2 m of urea, respectively. FtsZ lost its functional properties before any significant perturbation in the secondary or tertiary structure was detected by using several fluorescence techniques and far UV-CD indicating preferential local unfolding of the functional region(s). In addition, the unfolded FtsZ regains its ability to polymerize fully upon removal of urea. The data taken together suggest that FtsZ unfolds reversibly through a multistep process, and local responses that inhibit functional properties precede the global transition of FtsZ to the unfolded state.

Equilibrium unfolding studies of globular proteins have provided significant understanding of a large number of local and long-range interactions that are essential for protein folding and stability (1Baldwin R.L.

The simplest mechanism is that of a two-state transition, i.e. a reaction that proceeds directly from the folded state to the unfolded state without the occurrence of any detectable intermediates. However, recent studies have demonstrated that the folding and unfolding processes of several proteins involve multiple steps that are associated with one or more productive/nonproductive intermediates (5Panda M. Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Nolting B. Golbik R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Several studies have led to insights into the conformational properties of partially folded intermediates and rate-limiting transition states (5Panda M. Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 6Nolting B. Golbik R. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein. Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These partially folded intermediates are thought to be the early kinetic intermediates in the folding pathways of polypeptides. One of the well-characterized intermediates is a molten globule state, which contains native-like secondary structure but it has less compact tertiary structure with an increase in hydrophobic surface (8Ptitsyn O.B.

The molten globule state is induced in several proteins by mild denaturants, changing pH, ionic strength, and temperature (9Kuwajima K.

FtsZ, a monomeric protein of single polypeptide chain of 383 residues, is a key cytoskeletal protein in bacteria that plays a major role in septum formation during bacterial cell division (14Yi Q.M. Lutkenhaus J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 36: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 15Bi E. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 2765-2768Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). FtsZ is considered as a prokaryotic homolog of the eukaryotic cytoskeletal protein tubulin (16van den Ent F. Amos L. Lowe J. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2001; 4: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Like tubulin, FtsZ displays GTPase activity and polymerizes in a GTP-dependent manner (17Nogales E. Downing K.H. Amos L.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). FtsZ and tubulin have similar GTP binding motifs and the T7 loop, which is thought to be involved in the binding and hydrolysis of GTP, is conserved in both proteins (23Diaz J.F. Kralicek A.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 521-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In addition, hydrophobic interactions play a major role during polymerization of both FtsZ and tubulin (25Yu X.C. Margolin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10216-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Yu X.C. Margolin W. Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. J.

Further, monosodium glutamate induces polymerization of FtsZ and tubulin in a similar manner (28Beuria T.K. Krishnakumar S.S. Sahar S. Singh N. Gupta K. Meshram M. Panda D. J. Biol.

However, FtsZ and tubulin differ in many ways; for example, promoters of tubulin polymerization such as dimethyl sulfoxide, glycerol, and taxol fail to promote FtsZ polymerization (28Beuria T.K.

U. S. A. 1996; 93: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). In addition, several drugs such as vinblastine and colchicine bind to tubulin and inhibit microtubule polymerization but most anti-tubulin agents do not bind to FtsZ or affect its polymerization (25Yu X.C. Margolin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10216-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Yu X.C. Margolin W. Gonzalez-Garay M.L. Cabral F. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2301-2311PubMed Google Scholar). FtsZ has been overexpressed in bacteria in the soluble form in large quantities. However, overexpression of soluble tubulin has not yet been achieved. Several studies have indicated that the folding and unfolding mechanism of tubulin is an extremely complex process (31Sackett D.L. Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12868-12878Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Guha S. Bhattacharyya B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6925-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Wolff J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43262-43270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Most recently, Andreu et al. (35Andreu J.M. Oliva M.A. Monasterio O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43262-43270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) reported guanidium chloride-induced unfolding of FtsZ from Methanococcus jannaschii and Escherichia coli. This elegant study showed that FtsZ and tubulin display differential folding/unfolding behaviors. They used circular dichroism and the release of nucleotide to monitor unfolding and found that FtsZ released its bound nucleotide at lower denaturant concentrations where the effect of guanidium chloride on the circular dichroism spectra was not significant. In their work, the formation of an intermediate state during guanidium chloride-induced unfolding of FtsZ was not studied. In many proteins, although an intermediate forms during the unfolding process, the intermediate is often not detected due to the lack of an appropriate probe. It is believed that the detection of an intermediate under equilibrium conditions helps in understanding the mechanisms of protein unfolding and folding. In this study, we wanted to examine whether an intermediate is formed during the unfolding process of FtsZ. Intrinsic tryptophan residues of proteins have been routinely used as reporter groups for examining unfolding and folding processes. However, E. coli FtsZ does not contain a tryptophan residue that could be used to identify an intermediate during the unfolding process. To circumvent this problem, a fluorescent group was introduced in FtsZ by covalently modifying FtsZ with fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (FITC) 1The abbreviations used are: FITC, fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate; ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid; DE-52, diethylaminoethyl cellulose; Pipes, piperazine-1,4-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid). with the idea that the covalently bound FITC will serve the role of an intrinsic probe. In addition, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (ANS), a non-covalent environment-sensitive probe, was used to examine the hydrophobic surface rearrangement of FtsZ during its unfolding. In this study, we found that FtsZ undergoes reversible unfolding in the presence of urea. The functional properties of FtsZ, such as polymerization of FtsZ, are extremely sensitive to low concentrations of denaturants. A variety of fluorescence techniques and circular dichroism spectroscopy were used to investigate the unfolding pathways of FtsZ in the presence of urea and at elevated temperatures. Urea-induced unfolding of FtsZ follows a two-step unfolding pathway; an intermediate is formed during the first unfolding transition in the presence of low concentrations of urea that unfolds completely during the second unfolding step at high concentrations of urea. Further, extremely low concentrations of urea inhibited polymerization and hydrolysis of GTP without significantly perturbing the secondary and tertiary structures of FtsZ, indicating that the loss of functional properties occurs prior to formation of the intermediate. Materials—ANS was purchased from Molecular Probes. FITC, piperazine-1, 4-bis (2-ethanesulfonic acid) (Pipes), EDTA, GTP, guanidium chloride, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and urea were purchased from Sigma. DE-52 was purchased from Whatman International Ltd. All other reagents used were of analytical grade. Protein Purification—Recombinant E. coli FtsZ protein was purified from E. coli BL21 strain using DE-52 ion exchange chromatography followed by a cycle of monosodium glutamate induced polymerization and depolymerization as described in our recent report (28Beuria T.K. Krishnakumar S.S. Sahar S. Singh N. Gupta K. Meshram M. Panda D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3735-3741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The purity of FtsZ was found to be >98% by analyzing a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE of the protein (data not shown). The protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as a standard (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The protein was frozen and stored at –80 °C. Spectroscopic Methods—The unfolding processes of FtsZ under different conditions were examined using several spectroscopic techniques. Fluorescence spectroscopic studies were performed using a JASCO FP-6500 spectrofluorometer equipped with a constant temperature water-circulating bath. An appropriate blank spectrum was subtracted from the respective spectrum. The fluorescence spectra were measured using 1 μm FtsZ. The excitation and emission bandwidths were fixed at 5-nm each and a quartz cuvette of 0.3-cm pathlength was used for all measurements to reduce the inner filter effect. For the experiments involving ANS binding to FtsZ, 360 nm was used as the excitation wavelength and the emission spectrum was recorded over the range of 420–550 nm. Circular dichroism studies were performed in a JASCO J810 spectropolarimeter equipped with a Peltier temperature controller. The secondary structure was monitored over the wavelength range of 200–260 nm using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette and the ellipticity was determined at 220 nm. A spectral bandwidth of 10 nm and time constant of 1 s were used for all measurements. Each spectrum was recorded using an average of 5 scans. Preparation of Denaturant Solutions—Urea solutions were made in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 6.8. For determining the effects of urea, SDS, and guanidium chloride on FtsZ assembly and GTP hydrolysis, the denaturant solutions were prepared in 25 mm Pipes buffer at pH 6.8. Finally, the desired pH of the urea solutions was achieved by adding HCl. Fresh urea solutions were used for each unfolding experiment. Polarization Studies—Polarization experiments were done using JASCO FDP 200/210 polarization accessories in a JASCO FP-6500 spectrofluorometer. The fluorescence intensity components Ivv, Ivh, Ihv, and Ihh were used to calculate the steady-state fluorescence polarization (37Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy 2nd Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999: 291-320Google Scholar, 38Panda D. Roy S. Bhattacharyya B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9709-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) using Equation 1,P=(Ivv−GIvh)/(Ivv+GIvh)(Eq. 1) where G is the correction factor for the transmission efficiency and is given as Ihv/Ihh. The subscripts h and v refer to the horizontal and vertical positions of excitation and emission polarization, respectively. Determination of the Dissociation Constant of ANS and FtsZ Interaction—The increased ANS fluorescence at 475 nm upon binding to FtsZ was used to determine the dissociation constant of the ANS and FtsZ interaction (39Gupta K. Dulal P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13029-13038Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 40Ward J.L. Edelman G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1971; 117: 509-525Google Scholar). FtsZ (1 μm) was incubated with varying concentrations (5–75 μm) of ANS for 30 min at 25 °C before measuring the protein fluorescence. The fluorescence measurements were performed using 360 nm as an excitation wavelength. The fraction of binding sites (α) occupied by ANS was calculated using Equation 2,α=(F−F0)/Fmax(Eq. 2) where F0 is the fluorescence intensity of ANS in the absence of FtsZ, F is the fluorescence intensity of ANS in the presence of FtsZ and Fmax is the calculated fluorescence intensity of the fully liganded FtsZ. Fmax was determined by plotting 1/(F- F0) versus 1/L and extrapolating 1/L = 0, where L equals the total ANS concentration. The dissociation constant (Kd) was determined using the double reciprocal relationship in Equation 3,1/α=1+Kd/Lf(Eq. 3) where Lf is the free ligand concentration and calculated Lf = l- α [C], where C is the molar concentration of ligand binding sites assuming a single binding site per FtsZ. The interaction of ANS with FtsZ in the presence of urea was determined by first incubating FtsZ with different concentrations of urea for 30 min and then adding ANS to the reaction mixtures. The dissociation constant at each urea concentration is an average of four individual experiments. Chemical Modification—FtsZ contains several lysine residues (14Yi Q.M. Lutkenhaus J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 36: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and the presence of these lysine residues provides a tool to introduce a fluorophore in the protein through covalent modification of the amino group of the lysine residues. FtsZ (50 μm) was incubated with 500 μm FITC in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8 for 3 h at 25 °C. The labeling reaction was quenched by adding 5 mm Tris-(hydroxymethyl-)aminomethane hydrochloride on ice for 30 min, and the complex was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to remove any aggregates. Free FITC was removed from FtsZ bound FITC by two steps; initially by dialyzing the reaction mixture against 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 at 4 °C and finally by passing the solution through a size-exclusion P4 column, previously equilibrated with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 at 4 °C. The concentration of FtsZ-bound FITC was determined from the absorbance at 495 nm using a molar extinction coefficient of 77,000 m–1 cm–1. The concentration of FtsZ was determined by the method of Bradford (36Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). The incorporation ratio of FITC per mol of FtsZ was determined by dividing the bound FITC concentration by the FtsZ concentration. Light Scattering Assay—FtsZ (6 μm) in 25 mm Pipes buffer (pH 6.8) was incubated in the absence and presence of different concentrations of urea for 30 min at 25 °C. Then 5 mm MgSO4, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm GTP was added and placed immediately in a cuvette at 37 °C, and the polymerization reaction was monitored at 37 °C by light scattering (28Beuria T.K. Krishnakumar S.S. Sahar S. Singh N. Gupta K. Meshram M. Panda D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3735-3741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 41Mukherjee A. Lutkenhaus J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 823-832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 500 nm using a JASCO 6500 spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 500 nm. We used the standard light scattering assay to determine whether low concentrations of urea induced aggregation of FtsZ (5Panda M. Gorovits B.M. Horowitz P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 63-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The light scattering of FtsZ (1 μm) was monitored immediately after addition of protein to different final concentrations (0.1–0.5 m) of urea in 25 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) in the absence of divalent calcium and GTP at 25 °C for 10 min. The excitation and emission wavelengths were fixed at 500 nm and the excitation and emission band passes used were 1 and 5 nm, respectively. GTPase Assay—A malachite green sodium molybdate assay was used to measure the production of inorganic phosphate during GTP hydrolysis (28Beuria T.K. Krishnakumar S.S. Sahar S. Singh N. Gupta K. Meshram M. Panda D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 278: 3735-3741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 42Geladopoulos T.P. Sotiroudis T.G. Evangelopoulos A.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 112-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Samples containing 6 μm FtsZ in the absence and presence of different concentrations of urea were incubated in 25 mm Pipes buffer (pH 6.8) at 25 °C for 30 min. After 30 min of incubation, 3 mm MgSO4 and 1 mm GTP were added to the reaction mixtures, and incubation was continued for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. The hydrolysis reaction was quenched at the desired time by addition of 10% (v/v) 7 m perchloric acid. The quenched reaction mixtures were then centrifuged for 5 min at 25 °C to remove aggregated proteins. 15 μl of the supernatants were incubated with freshly prepared 900-μl solutions of filtered malachite green solution (0.045% malachite green, 4.2% ammonium molybdate, and 0.02% Triton X-100) at room temperature for 30 min, and the phosphate ions produced were determined by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm. The reaction was normalized including a control in the absence of FtsZ. A phosphate standard curve was prepared using sodium phosphate. FtsZ Unfolding by Monitoring ANS Fluorescence—Tryptophan fluorescence is highly environment sensitive and the presence of tryptophan residues in a protein provides a convenient tool for analyzing the protein folding mechanism. However, FtsZ does not contain a tryptophan residue. Therefore, we used both covalent and noncovalent extrinsic probes for analyzing the unfolding processes of FtsZ. The environment-sensitive noncovalent probe ANS has been used extensively to analyze hydrophobic surface arrangements in proteins during unfolding and folding processes (8Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein. Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sackett D.L. Bhattacharyya B. Wolff J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12868-12878Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Guha S. Bhattacharyya B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6925-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Recently, ANS has been shown to bind to FtsZ (25Yu X.C. Margolin W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10216-10222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The binding of ANS to FtsZ increased ANS fluorescence 7-fold, and this increase occurred along with a significant blue shift (36 nm) of the emission maximum from 512 to 476 nm (data not shown). FtsZ (1 μm) was incubated with different concentrations of urea (0.1–8 m) for 30 min. Then, 50 μm ANS was added to the mixtures, and the mixtures were incubated for an additional 30 min. The FtsZ-ANS fluorescence decreased in a complex manner with increasing denaturant concentrations at pH 6.8 (Fig. 1). The progressive loss of FtsZ-ANS fluorescence occurred in two steps. Initially, there was a strong reduction in ANS fluorescence in the presence of low concentrations of urea. For example, the fluorescence intensity decreased by 35% in the presence of 0.5 m urea. However, very little decrease in FtsZ-ANS fluorescence occurred beyond 0.5 m urea. The fluorescence remained almost unchanged up to 1.25 m urea indicating formation of an intermediate in the range of 0.5 to 1.25 m urea. Beyond 1.25 m urea, FtsZ-ANS fluorescence decreased sharply with increasing urea concentrations and the second transition was completed at 3 m urea. The FtsZ-ANS complex showed an emission maximum at 476 nm in the absence of urea, and the emission maximum increased minimally (3 nm) in the presence of 1 m urea (Fig. 1). However, the emission maxima increased sharply beyond 1.25 m urea. For example, the emission maximum was 512 nm in the presence of 3 m urea and the half-maximal increase in the emission maxima occurred at 1.5 m urea. The red shift of the ANS-FtsZ spectra in the presence of increasing concentrations of urea indicated that ANS binding deceases with increasing urea concentration. We have also determined the effects of low concentrations of urea on the dissociation constant for the ANS and FtsZ interaction. Urea increased the dissociation constant of the ANS and FtsZ interaction in a concentration-dependent manner. For example, the dissociation constant was found to be 24 ± 7 μm in the absence of urea and 36 ± 7 μm,43 ± 4 μm, and 57 ± 9 μm in the presence of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 m urea, respectively. The modest increase in the dissociation constant for the ANS-FtsZ interaction indicated that low concentrations of urea induce a local conformational change in the protein, which causes a reduction in ANS binding. Further, we determined whether low concentrations of urea could induce aggregation of FtsZ by monitoring 90° light scattering at 500 nm as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The light scattering intensity did not change detectably in the absence and presence of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 m urea suggesting that low concentrations of urea do not induce aggregation of FtsZ (data not shown). Thus, the initial decrease in ANS fluorescence was not due to aggregation of FtsZ monomers but due to a reduction in the ANS-FtsZ binding interaction. Unfolding of FtsZ by Monitoring FITC Polarization—We labeled lysine residues in FtsZ by FITC as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Under the conditions used, the incorporation ratio of FITC per FtsZ monomer was 0.6 ± 0.2. The unfolding equilibrium of FtsZ was monitored using polarization of covalently labeled fluorescent FtsZ (FITC-FtsZ) because the covalently labeled fluorescent probe could provide information, which is similar to intrinsic probes like tryptophan and different from the noncovalent hydrophobic probes such as ANS. Fig. 2 shows a polarization profile of the FITC-FtsZ in the presence of different concentrations of urea. The progressive decrease of polarization occurred in two stages with a plateau like region at ∼0.5 m urea. The first transition was completed at 0.5 m urea with a 29% decrease in the polarization value. There was only minimal decrease (∼8%) in the polarization of FITC-FtsZ from 0.5 m urea to 1.75 m urea indicating that an intermediate was formed. A similar trend was also observed when the FtsZ-ANS fluorescence was used to monitor the urea-induced unfolding of FtsZ (Fig. 1). The second transition started at 1.75 m urea and the polarization values decreased sharply with further increasing urea concentrations with half-maximal decrease in polarization occurring at 2.5 m urea. A limiting polarization value for FITC-FtsZ was achieved at 4 m urea. Structural Transition as Monitored by Ellipticity Change— The secondary structural changes of FtsZ were followed by monitoring the far-UV circular dichroism spectra of FtsZ as a function of urea concentration (Fig. 3A). The variation of CD (mdeg) at 220 nm as a function of urea concentration is shown in the Fig. 3B. The secondary structure content of FtsZ increased minimally (∼4%) in the presence of 0.5 m urea compared with Fts"
https://openalex.org/W2028160745,"The calcium-liberating second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) is converted to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) by Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinases (IP3Ks) that add a fourth phosphate group to the 3-position of the inositol ring. Two isoforms of IP3Ks (named A and B) from different vertebrate species have been well studied. Recently the cloning and examination of a human full-length cDNA encoding a novel isoform, termed human IP3K-C (HsIP3K-C), has been reported. In the present study we report the cloning of a full-length cDNA encoding a rat homologue of HsIP3K-C with a unique mRNA expression pattern, which differs remarkably from the tissue distribution of HsIP3K-C. Of the rat tissues examined, rat IP3K-C (RnIP3K-C) is mainly present in heart, brain, and testis and shows the strongest expression in an epidermal tissue, namely tongue epithelium. RnIP3K-C has a calculated molecular mass of ∼74.5 kDa and shows an overall identity of ∼75% with HsIP3K-C. A bacterially expressed, enzymatically active and Ca2+-calmodulin-regulated fragment of this isoform displays remarkable enzymatic properties like a very low Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3 (∼0.2 μm), substrate inhibition by high concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3, allosteric product activation by Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 in absence of Ca2+-calmodulin (Ka(app) 0.52 μm), and the ability to efficiently phosphorylate a second InsP3 substrate, inositol 2,4,5-trisphosphate, to inositol 2,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate in the presence of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. Furthermore, the RnIP3K-C fused with a fluorescent protein tag is actively transported into and out of the nucleus when transiently expressed in mammalian cells. A leucine-rich nuclear export signal and an uncharacterized nuclear import activity are localized in the N-terminal domain of the protein and determine its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. These findings point to a particular role of RnIP3K-C in nuclear inositol trisphosphate phosphorylation and cellular growth. The calcium-liberating second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) is converted to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) by Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinases (IP3Ks) that add a fourth phosphate group to the 3-position of the inositol ring. Two isoforms of IP3Ks (named A and B) from different vertebrate species have been well studied. Recently the cloning and examination of a human full-length cDNA encoding a novel isoform, termed human IP3K-C (HsIP3K-C), has been reported. In the present study we report the cloning of a full-length cDNA encoding a rat homologue of HsIP3K-C with a unique mRNA expression pattern, which differs remarkably from the tissue distribution of HsIP3K-C.

These findings point to a particular role of RnIP3K-C in nuclear inositol trisphosphate phosphorylation and cellular growth. For the conversion of the calcium-liberating second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) 1Inositol phosphates are abbreviated according to the relaxed IUPAC nomenclature. (1Berridge M.J. Irvine R.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3312) Google Scholar), all metazoan cells examined so far seem to possess two types of enzyme activities: first, the 5-phosphatases (2Drayer A.L.

Trans. 1996; 24: 1001-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), which degrade it to inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and thereby initiate the recycling of the inositol moiety into membrane phospholipids; and second, the 3-kinases (IP3Ks), 2The abbreviations used are: IP3K, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; CaM, calmodulin; NLS, nuclear localization signal; NES, nuclear export signal; MDD, metal dye detection; HsIP3K-C, human inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C; RnIP3K-C, rat inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-kinase C; LMB, leptomycin B; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; CBD, calmodulin binding domain; PK, pyruvate kinase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; aa, amino acid(s); RT, reverse transcription. which use ATP to add a fourth phosphate group to the 3-position of the inositol ring to generate the signaling molecule inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (Ins (1,3,4,5)P4). This InsP4 isomer has been implicated in signaling functions concerning the regulation of a Ras GTPase-activating protein (3Cullen P.J. Hsuan J.J. Truong O. Letcher A.J. Jackson T.R. Dawson A.P.

Bioessays. 1991; 13: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and other potential functions (5Niinobe M. Yamaguchi Y. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17826-17832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 is the first product derived from Ins(1,4,5)P3 that can be converted to a plethora of inositol phosphate isomers found in metazoan cells (7Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Bioessays. 1997; 19: 593-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), ranging from different InsP4 isomers through InsP5 isomers and InsP6 to the pyrophosphate-containing InsP7 and InsP8 isomers. For IP3K in invertebrates three splice variants of one single IP3K-gene have been characterized in Caenorhabditis elegans (8Clandinin T.R. DeModena J.A. Sternberg P.W. Cell. 1998; 92: 523-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In vertebrates on the cDNA level, two isoforms from different genes have so far been characterized from different species (see Ref. 9Bertsch U. Haefs M. Moller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and citations within). Recently the cDNA of a third human isoform, termed HsIP3K-C, with a calculated molecular mass of 75.2 kDa and a broad range of tissues expressing this isoform has been published (10Dewaste V. Pouillon V. Moreau C. Shears S. Takazawa K. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The stimulation of IP3K activity by Ca2+-CaM might be an important factor in the control of calcium oscillations in mammalian cells. However, the degree of stimulation by Ca2+-CaM found for HsIP3K-C was much lower than that observed for the A and B isoforms (see Ref. 10Dewaste V. Pouillon V. Moreau C. Shears S. Takazawa K. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar and citations therein). Although the A isoform is stimulated by Ca2+-CaM by a factor of ∼2–3, in particular the B isoform is strongly activated by Ca2+-CaM by a factor of ∼10. For the brain- and testis-specific isoform A, an F-actin targeting function of its N-terminal domain (24Schell M.J. Erneux C. Irvine R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37537-37546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), a domain obviously not necessary for the enzymatic function (9Bertsch U. Haefs M. Moller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), has been reported. Dewaste et al. (10Dewaste V. Pouillon V. Moreau C. Shears S. Takazawa K. Erneux C. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 343-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) reported that the HsIP3K-C is a predominantly cytosolic enzyme when transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, but did not demonstrate a specific targeting function of its N-terminal domain. Thus, the genuine function of IP3K-C and the regulatory or targeting function of its N-terminal domain remained unclear up to now. In this study we highlighted possible special roles of IP3K-C in the cellular and in particular in nuclear inositol phosphate metabolism. A rat homologue of HsIP3K-C, termed rat Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase C (RnIP3K-C) was identified. Its mRNA expression pattern in different tissues, the enzymatic properties and the allosteric regulation of bacterially expressed enzyme, and the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of EGFP fusion proteins derived from RnIP3K-C expressed in mammalian cells were examined. The most interesting findings of our study are that the RnIP3K-C enzyme is strongly Ca2+-CaM-activated in a substrate concentration-dependent manner, is enzymatically optimized for an efficient conversion of basal cellular concentrations of Ins(1,4,5)P3 in presence of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4, and can convert Ins(2,4,5)P3 to Ins(2,4,5,6)P4 under these conditions. Furthermore, RnIP3K-C undergoes active nucleocytoplasmic shuttling as a result of a hitherto unidentified nuclear localization activity and an identified nuclear export signal (NES) both residing in the N-terminal domain of the enzyme. Active transport of proteins between the nucleus and cytoplasm is mediated mainly by the intensively studied canonical nuclear localization signals (NLS) and by the recently characterized nuclear export signal (both reviewed in Refs. 11Gorlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar and 12Nigg E.A. Nature. 1997; 386: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Leptomycin B (LMB), an antifungal antibiotic and an inhibitor of the cell cycle in mammalian and fission yeast cells (13Yoshida M. Nishikawa M. Nishi K. Abe K. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 187: 150-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), binds to CRM1 (for chromosome region maintenance), an NES receptor in the nuclear pore complex (14Kudo N. Wolff B. Sekimoto T. Schreiner E.P. Yoneda Y. Yanagida M. Horinouchi S. Yoshida M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar), and thereby inhibits NES-dependent nuclear export (15Wolff B. Sanglier J.J. Wang Y. Chem. Biol. 1997; 4: 139-147Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). By employing LMB inhibition and deleting the canonical NES in the N-terminal domain of RnIP3K-C, we could prove the functionality of this site and the nuclear shuttling activities of the enzyme when expressed in cells. Cloning of Rat Inositol 1,4,5-Trisphosphate 3-Kinase Isoform C (RnIP3K-C) cDNA—Degenerate primers (forward, 5′-CAA(A/G)CC(A/G/T/C)CG(A/G/T/C)TA(C/T)ATGCA(A/G)TGG-3′; reverse, 5′-AGCC(G/A)TCCTC(C/A/G)CG(G/A)TT(G/C)CCCTC-3′) were designed according to the completely conserved amino acid sequences KPRYMQW and EGNREDG, respectively, in the catalytic domain of rat and human IP3K-A and IP3K-B, and IP3K from chicken (see Ref. 9Bertsch U. Haefs M. Moller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar and citations within). A PCR using 3 μl of a λZAP Express cDNA library prepared from rat circumvallate papilla (16Schmale H. Bamberger C. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1363-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) as template in a total volume of 50 μl was carried out as follows: 94 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and finally 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products isolated from the single band of ∼400 bp were subcloned into pUC18 using the SureClone ligation kit (Amersham Biosciences). The nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy termination method with an ABI Prism 373A sequence analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). 22 phage pools of the circumvallate cDNA library, each consisting of ∼5 × 104 independent plaque-forming units were screened using the PCR with the primer pair and under conditions as described above. 1 × 105 plaque-forming units of each of the three pools that were positive in the PCR pre-selection were plated onto Escherichia coli XL-1 MRF′ cells; the DNA was transferred to nitrocellulose filters and hybridized conventionally with the 32P-labeled subcloned PCR fragment. The hybridizing 11 plaques were purified by three rounds of plating and hybridization and finally converted into recombinant pBK-CMV plasmids by in vivo excision according to the protocol from the supplier (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). After diagnostic restriction fragment analysis, the clone exhibiting the longest insert of ∼3.3 kb was sequenced on both strands using a set of gene-specific primers. 5′-RACE—mRNA, purified by oligo(dT) columns (Amersham Biosciences) from total RNA prepared from rat brain (strain Wistar) as described (17Kingston P.A. Zufall F. Barnstable C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10440-10445Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), was used for 5′-RACE employing the MarathonTM kit (Clontech) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. For reverse transcription, carried out for1hat42 °C, a gene-specific primer (5′-GGGCCTCGGCTGGCAATG-3′) was used in a reaction containing 3.5 μg of mRNA. With the generated double-stranded cDNA, a first round of PCR was performed using a gene-specific primer (5′-CGGCACGGGCAGCGCCTCATAC-3′) and primer AP1 (MarathonTM kit) with an annealing temperature of 56 °C. On the diluted PCR product, nested PCR was performed using a gene-specific primer (5′-CTTCCCCTTTAAATCCTACAAG-3′) and primer AP2 (MarathonTM kit) and an annealing temperature of 56 °C. A second round of RACE PCR was done on the original cDNA template with a gene-specific primer (5′-GCTCCAGGCCGCTCGGATATGTAG-3′) and primer AP1 using an annealing temperature of 56 °C. From this reaction a nested PCR was performed with a gene-specific primer (5′-TATGTAGGGGTTAACCGATACTC-3′) and primer AP2 at 59 °C annealing temperature. Northern Blot Analysis—A Northern blot containing ∼2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA/lane from eight different rat tissues was purchased and hybridized according to the instructions from the supplier (Clontech). The 3.3-kb DNA fragment representing the full-length RnIP3K-C cDNA labeled with [32P]dCTP by random priming was used for hybridization in ExpressHyb solution at 68 °C for 90 min, followed by washing two times in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 40 min at 50 °C. To compare specifically RnIP3K-C mRNA in tongue and taste epithelium with other tissues, 15 μg of glyoxylated total RNA/lane was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred onto a Hybond N membrane (Amersham Biosciences) and hybridized with the radioactive RnIP3K-C probe described above. Hybridization in ULTRAHyb solution at 42 °C overnight and washing in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 45 °C were carried out according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Ambion, Austin, TX). As control for RNA loading and integrity, the blot was stripped and hybridized with a 32P-labeled actin probe under the same conditions. Blots were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen for up to 24 h and analyzed in a Fujix Bio-Imaging Analyzer (BAS 2000). Reverse Transcription-PCR—1 μg of total RNA from various rat tissues including enzymatically prepared tongue and taste epithelium was reverse transcribed using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamer primers (Amersham Biosciences). A pair of RnIP3K-C-specific primers (forward, 5′-TTCACAGACCTGACCTCC-3′; reverse, 5′-GAAGCCATCGGTGTCATGTG-3′) was designed to amplify a 271-bp fragment from 1/20 of the reverse transcribed total RNA using the Taq PCR Master Mix (Qiagen). PCR was performed in 25 cycles (94 °C, 1 min for the initial denaturation, 94 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 30 s; 72 °C, 30 s for each cycle and 72 °C, 10 min for the final elongation). Following the same protocol, a hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase fragment of 526 bp was amplified as control. PCR fragments were visualized with ethidium bromide after separation of equal volumes of each reaction on a 1.8% agarose gel. Bacterial Expression of a RnIP3K-C Fragment Comprising the CaM Binding and the Catalytic Domain (CBD-RnIP3K-C) and a Fragment Comprising Only the Catalytic Domain (ΔCBD-RnIP3K-C)—A fragment of the protein coding region of RnIP3K-C (termed CBDRnIP3K-C) comprising CaM binding and catalytic domain (amino acids 366–678) was amplified with the following primer pair (5′-GAGGATGACCATATGGCTGGGGGCGGAGGTACCAG-3′; 5′-TCCTCACTAGTGAGCCTAGCAGTGGCAGCTG-3′) in a PCR (25 cycles) using 2.5 units of Pfu polymerase (Promega) in a 100-μl standard reaction mixture according to the manufacturer (annealing temperature of 65 °C and 4-min elongation at 72 °C/cycle). The PCR product was first cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega). The cloned PCR product was cleaved out with NdeI and SpeI and re-ligated into pET17b vector (Novagen) previously cut with the same restriction enzymes. The recombinant fragment of RnIP3K-C was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pRIL cells (Novagen) transformed with the resulting expression vector and purified by phosphocellulose and CaM affinity chromatography essentially as described previously for chicken IP3K (9Bertsch U. Haefs M. Moller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A fragment of RnIP3K-C (termed ΔCBD-RnIP3K-C) comprising only the catalytic domain (amino acids 410–678) was amplified with the following primer pair (5′-AACAGCTATGACCATGATTACGCC-3′;5′-ACGGCGCCTCCGGACATGCTGGGAACTTCC-3′) in a PCR as described above. The PCR product cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector was cleaved out with EheI and NsiI and re-ligated into pET17b vector (Novagen). The fragment of RnIP3K-C was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS,pREP cells (Novagen) transformed with the resulting expression vector and purified by phosphocellulose chromatography essentially as described previously for chicken IP3K (9Bertsch U. Haefs M. Moller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). No addition of lysozyme to the cells was necessary, because of the lysozyme expression by the bacteria. The destruction of DNA by DNase treatment was replaced by a sonification step. Enzymatic Analysis of CBD-RnIP3K-C and ΔCBD-RnIP3K-C—Enzymatic activities were measured under various substrate, product, activator, and inhibitor concentrations using a coupled enzymatic optical assay essentially as described previously (9Bertsch U. Haefs M. Moller M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Kitzerow A. Ozaki S. Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A Lambda 20 UV-visible spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) equipped with thermostatted cuvette holder and numerical data storage and derivation device (program UV Winlab, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was employed. The standard reaction conditions used in the assays were: 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm NADH, 1 mm phospho(enol) pyruvate, 0.5 mm ATP, 5 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 2.5 units/ml PK in the presence of 6 mm ammonium sulfate. All assays were performed at 30 °C after a 15-min preincubation of the reaction mixture. After following background NADH consumption in presence of PK, lactate dehydrogenase, and IP3K for 5–10 min, the IP3K assay was started with inositol phosphate substrate. All assays were performed in absence and presence of 0.1 μm Ca2+-CaM. In the latter case, 20 μm Ca2+ was present. The dependence of enzymatic activity on the concentration of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (bought from Alexis, Woburn, MA) was assayed by single transients. They were started at differing initial InsP3 concentrations (varying between 1 and 35 μm,) and followed in the optical assay until InsP3 was completely consumed. The Km for ATP was assayed by varying the initial ATP concentration at a fixed initial Ins(1,4,5)P3 concentration of 5 μm and measuring initial activities. Activation by Ca2+-CaM was also assayed by measuring initial activities at 5 μm initial Ins(1,4,5)P3; the concentration of Ca2+ was 20 μm, and that of CaM was varied. Activation or inhibition by Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 was assayed by determining the initial enzyme activity at 1 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3 and increasing concentrations of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 present before starting the optical assays. In case of the enzyme form ΔCBD-RnIP3K-C, the true Km for Ins(1,4,5)P3 of this enzyme form was determined from the Km(app) values of a series of single transients started at different initial Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 concentrations by plotting these parameters against Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 concentration. The y intercept of the resulting linear regression curve corresponds to Km, the x intercept to –Ki for Ins(1,3,4,5)P4. The reaction products generated by conversion of Ins(2,4,5)P3 (pure synthetic Ins(2,4,5)P3 was a gift from Barry V. L. Potter) and from assays of the activation of IP3K-C by Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 were analyzed by metal dye detection (MDD)HPLC (18Mayr G.W. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research.

B Biomed. Appl. 1995; 672: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For that, aliquots from the optical assay mixture were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated and charcoal-treated to remove ATP and NAD(H) as described (18Mayr G.W. Irvine R.F.

Construction of Fusion Genes and Fusion Gene Derivates—The EGFP fusion genes N-tagfull and C-tagfull were created by PCR techniques. The open reading frame of RnIP3K-C was amplified using primer pairs (N-tagfull: 5′-GTCGACATGAGGCGCTGCCCGTGCCG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTAGCTCTGGGCCAGGCCCTGAA-3′; C-tagfull: 5′-AGCGCTATGAGGCGCTGCCCGTGCCG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGGCTCTGGGCCAGGCCCTGAA-3′). The PCR products were initially cloned into the pGEM T-Easy vector (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The open reading frame was completely sequenced, and then the fragment was subcloned by the introduced restriction sites (SalI/BamHI for N-tagfull, Eco47III/XhoI for C-tagfull) into the expression vectors pEGFP-C1 and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech), respectively. The fusion gene derivates (N-tagNterm and C-tagNterm) containing an N-terminal fragment (aa 1–379) of RnIP3K-C were created by the same PCR techniques as the fusion genes using the following primer pairs (N-tagNterm: 5′-GTCGACATGAGGCGCTGCCCGTGCCG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTATCCAGATCTGTCCTCAGGATCGCT-3′; C-tagNterm: 5′-AGCGCTATGAGGCGCTGCCCGTGCCG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTCCAGATCTGTCCTCAGGATCGCT-3′). The deletion mutant C-tagfull,ΔNES (aa 318–326 deleted) and the point mutation C-tagfull,mNES (L318CPV mutated to ACPA) were created by using modified QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (21Wang W. Malcolm B.A. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). The C-tagfull fusion gene was used as template. The following primer pairs were used for mutagenesis (C-tagfull,ΔNES: 5′-TCCCACCTGGAGTGCAGCTCCACCTCAGAGTCTCCTGAGCCT-3′ and 5′-AGGCTCAGGAGACTCTGAGGTGGAGCTGCACTCCAGGTGGGA-3′; C-tagfull,mNES: 5′-TCCCACCTGGAGTGCAGCTCCGCGTGTCCTGCGCCCCGCCTTATCATCACCTCA-3′ and 5′-TGAGGTGATGATAAGGCGGGGCGCAGGACACGCGGAGCTGCACTCCAGGTGGGA-3′). Cell Culture, Transient Gene Expression, and Fluorescence Microscopy—The cell lines were purchased from Cell Lines Service (Heidelberg, Germany). NRK 52E cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). PC12 cells were grown in RPMI medium with Glutamax I supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen). Both cell lines were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere in the presence of 5% CO2. Cell transfections were performed using the Metafectene method according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Biontex Laboratories, Munich, Germany). Fixation, staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride, and examination of the intracellular localization by fluorescence microscopy were carried out as described (22Nalaskowski M.M. Deschermeier C. Fanick W. Mayr G.W. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A minimum of 100 undamaged cells/experiment were examined. LMB was purchased from Sigma and added to the complete medium to a final concentration of 11 ng/ml (20 nm). Statistics and Enzyme Kinetic Data Evaluation—Unpaired t test was performed using GraphPad InStat version 3.05 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Evaluation of enzyme kinetic parameters was performed from primary UV Winlab data sets as follows. In each assay data set (NADH consumption versus time), a correction for the initially determined background ATPase activity (coming from the indicator enzymes employed), a smoothing of corrected NADH versus time data, and a final derivation of specific activity versus substrate concentration data (v versus S data) was performed by exporting the data sets into Excel and employing special macro routines. For all enzymatic parameter and goodness of fit estimates performed with the final v versus S data, non-linear least squares techniques were employed. For that, the standard non-linear fitting and initial parameter definition techniques implied in the enzyme kinetics program GraphPad PRISM version 2.1 were used. Special kinetic models employed were formulated as described by Segel (47Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics.

Identification and Cloning of RnIP3K-C—To detect novel isoforms of Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinases (IP3Ks) from rat in addition to the known A and B forms, degenerate oligonucleotide primers were derived from highly conserved protein regions of the catalytic domains of all IP3K isoforms found so far in vertebrates (see Ref. 9Bertsch U.

The phage cDNA library used as template in the PCR was prepared from rat tongue epithelium containing predominantly keratinocytes and taste bud cells from the circumvallate papilla. After subcloning of the PCR products in the 400-bp band, restriction enzyme mapping indicated the presence of two types of clones (data not shown). Although the restriction pattern of one type was identical with the pattern expected for the rat isoform B, the other could not be assigned to a known isoform. Sequence analysis of several of those clones showed 62 and 65% identity on the nucleotide level to isoform A and B, respectively (data not shown). When the novel sequence was used to screen a circumvallate papilla cDNA library under stringent conditions, a 3309-bp cDNA clone containing a single long open reading frame and a poly(A) tail of 18 bp was isolated. The translated protein consists of 678 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 74,463 Da. Because the first methionine residue was not preceded by an in-frame translational stop codon, 5′-RACE experiments were performed to extend the sequence further to the 5′ end of the mRNA. In the 246 bp of sequence added by the analysis of the 5′-RACE products, two in-frame stop codons and no further in-frame initiation codon were identified. The presence of the 5′-sequence was confirmed independently by analysis of RTPCR fragments that span the junction between the RACE products and the original cDNA clone (data not shown). Therefore, the novel sequence has 353 bp of 5′-untranslated region and the 5′-most ATG found in the cDNA clone most probably represents the initiation codon, although the neighboring residues do not agree well with the Kozak consensus sequence (from –9 to +4: [GCC]GCC(A/G)CCATGG) (23Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-81248Crossref PubMed Scopus (4171) Google Scholar). The 3′-untranslated region of 1146 bp exhibits the polyadenylation signal AATAAA 18 nucleotides upstream of the poly(A) tail. The deduced protein sequence of RnIP3K-C shows significant identity with other IP3Ks and essentially the same domain structure (Fig. 1). The highest overall identity of ∼75% is found with the HsIP3K-C (10Dewaste V. Pouillon V. Moreau C. Shears S. Takazawa K. Erneux C."

Results show that different nucleotide-bound forms of PspF can change the interactions between σ54, σ54-RNA polymerase, and a DNA fork junction structure present within closed promoter complexes. This provides evidence that in the activation transduction pathway, several functional states of the activator, prior to ATP hydrolysis, can serve to alter the fork junction binding activity of σ54 and σ54-RNA polymerase that precede full DNA opening.

Transcription initiation is a major point at which gene expression is regulated.

In bacteria, a core RNAP (α2ββ′ω; E) associates with one of several sigma (σ) factors to form a functional holoenzyme. The σ subunit confers promoter specificity to the bacterial RNAP (reviewed in Refs. 1Wosten M.M. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1998; 22: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar and 2Gross C.A.

In Escherichia coli and many other bacteria, two types of RNAP holoenzymes exist: one that utilizes the vegetative σ factor σ70, or one of the five alternative σ70-like factors, and an enhancer-dependent one that uses the σ54 factor (reviewed in Refs. 3Merrick M.J.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 4129-4136Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The key difference between the σ70 and the σ54 types is the conversion step from closed promoter-RNAP complexes to productive open complexes. For the σ70 family, this conversion can occur spontaneously without the involvement of activators. For the enhancer-dependent σ54-RNAP, the transition from closed complex to open complex strictly relies upon the mechanochemical activity of enhancer-binding activators that belong to the ATPases associated with various cellular activities (AAA) family (reviewed in Refs. 4Buck M.

Microbiol. 2002; 45: 895-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). σ factors bind double-stranded promoter DNA and promoter DNA structures with single-stranded and double-stranded DNA juxtaposed (fork junctions) that mimic the conformational state of the promoter DNA as it exists within the transcription bubble. In the case of enhancer-dependent closed complexes, two base pairs at positions –12 and –11 (where DNA melting originates), which are adjacent to the transcription start site proximal promoter element (GC region; Table Ia), are transiently melted (6Morris L. Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interactions between σ54 and this transient fork junction structure are repressive, keeping the σ54-RNAP silent for transcription by inhibiting its ability to melt DNA and isomerize to form open complexes (7Guo Y.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2242-2255Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). σ54-RNAP binds tightly to the template strand of this transient fork junction structure and as a consequence fails to make interactions with the non-template strand adjacent to the –12 fork junction. The latter interaction is a critical feature of open complex formation by enhancer-dependent and -independent RNAPs (8Guo Y. Lew C.M. Gralla J.D.

Biol. 2001; 306: 681-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This nucleoprotein organization constitutes the direct binding target for AAA activators and is known as the regulatory center (12Wigneshweraraj S.R. Chaney M.K. Buck M. J. Mol.

Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The AAA activators of the σ54-RNAP couple the energy derived from ATP hydrolysis to remodel the regulatory center, relieving the inhibitory interactions with the template strand of the fork junction structure at –12 and promoting new interactions with the adjacent non-template strand required for forming open complexes (5Zhang X.

Open complex formation by the σ70-RNAP and σ54-RNAP proceeds via several intermediate states involving large conformational changes in the RNAP (15Murakami K.S. Masuda S. Campbell E.A. Muzzin O. Darst S.A. Science. 2002; 296: 1285-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). However, very little information exists on the mechanisms that trigger changes in RNAP and promoter DNA that lead to transcription. Analysis of the mechanisms of transcription initiation by the σ54-RNAP will extend our understanding further on the functioning of the RNAP as a complex molecular machine. Recently, we demonstrated that it is possible to “trap” σ54 or the σ54-RNAP bound to promoter DNA with the E. coli AAA activator phage shock protein F (PspF) in the presence of ADP aluminum fluoride (ADP·A1Fx), an analogue of ATP at the point of hydrolysis (13Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Using heteroduplex forms of the Sinorhizobium meliloti nifH promoter probes containing fork junction structures at –12 and, for experimental simplicity, only the AAA domain of PspF (PspF1–275) (Table Ib), we now report that nucleotide-dependent action of AAA activators on σ54 or σ54-RNAP significantly changes the interactions made with fork junction DNA at –12. Altered activator-dependent promoter DNA binding activities of σ54 and σ54-RNAP were observed in the presence of poorly or non-hydrolyzed forms of ATP (adenosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate (ATPγS) and ADP·AlFx, respectively), suggesting that several nucleotide bound states of the AAA activator, each capable of remodeling σ54-RNAP prior to completion of the ATP hydrolysis cycle, exist and that ATP hydrolysis per se is not needed for the partial remodeling of the regulatory center. Evidence that a mixed nucleotide-bound (ATP and ATPγS) state of the activator resulted in altered remodeling activity was also obtained. Overall the results provide clear evidence that discrete functionalities are associated with different nucleotide bound states of PspF, which orchestrate open complex formation by the σ54-RNAP during the ATP hydrolysis cycle by remodeling σ54-RNAP-fork junction interactions. Hence by inference we suggest that other AAA proteins will have several distinct nucleotide-dependent functional states. DNA and Proteins—The main DNA molecules and proteins used in this work are listed in Table I. The Klebsiella pneumoniae σ54 protein (amino acids 1–477) and a derivative lacking region 1 (amino acids 57–477, Δ1σ54) were prepared as described before (16Cannon W. Missailidis S. Smith C. Cottier A. Austin S. Moore M. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 781-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Mutant σ54 proteins (amino acids 1–477) were purified as described before (10Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The intact AAA domain of PspF lacking the C-terminal DNA-binding domain, PspF1–275, was used in activation assays (17Bordes P. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Schumacher J. Zhang X. Chaney M.K. Buck M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2278-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). E. coli core RNAP (E) was from Epicentre Technologies. Wild type homoduplex or mismatched S. meliloti nifH promoter DNA heteroduplexes were prepared by annealing 88-bp oligonucleotides as described (11Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Casaz P. Buck M.

Native Gel Mobility Shift Assays—Binding reactions were conducted at 30 °C in STA buffer (25 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 8 mm Mg-acetate, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol and 3.5%(w/v) PEG-6000). Where indicated, σ54, ΔIσ54, or mutant σ54 were present at 1 μm and the σ54-RNAP holoenzyme at 100 nm (formed with 1:4 ratio of core RNAP to σ54). σ54 proteins or σ54-RNAP were incubated for 5 min with 16 nm promoter probe and nucleotides as required: ADP·AlFx (formed in situ by the addition of 0.2 mm AlCl3 to a mixture containing 0.2 mm ADP and 5.0 mm NaF; Ref. 13Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), ATP (2 mm), ATPγS (2 mm, unless otherwise stated), or ATPγS/ATP mixture (0.2/2 mm, unless otherwise stated). After addition of 10 μm PspF1–275 (unless otherwise stated) the reactions were incubated for a further 10 min prior to resolving on a 4.5% native polyacrylamide gel. Native gels were run in 25 mm Tris, 200 mm glycine buffer (pH 8.6). Complexes were detected by PhosphorImager analysis. The error range for the amount of DNA band shifted was ±5%, depending upon the σ54 and ATPγS preparations used. For comparative purposes when using variants in PspF or DNA the same σ54 and ATPγS preparations were used. DNA Footprinting Assays—Binding reactions (10 μl) were conducted as described above but with 100 nm promoter DNA probe and in STA buffer without dithiothreitol. Footprinting reagents were added as described (11Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 386-394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), reactions were terminated, and bound and unbound DNAs were separated on native polyacrylamide gels. DNA was then excised, processed, and analyzed on a denaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel. For ortho-copper phenanthroline (OP-Cu) footprinting, 0.5 μl of a solution of 4 mmortho-phenanthroline, 0.92 mm CuSO4, and 0.5 μl of 0.116 m mercaptoproprionic acid were added to the reactions and incubated for 2 min. The reactions were terminated by the addition of 1 μl of 28 mm 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline. For DNase I footprints, 1.75 × 10–3 units of enzyme (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the reactions for 1 min, followed by addition of 10 mm EDTA to stop cutting. For KMnO4 footprinting, 4 mm fresh KMnO4 was added for 30 s, followed by 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol to quench DNA oxidation. Gel-isolated DNA was eluted into 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 8) (for DNase I footprinting) or H2O (for OP-Cu and KMnO4 footprinting) overnight at 37 °C. KMnO4-oxidized DNA was cleaved with 10% (v/v) piperidine at 90 °C for 20 min. Recoveries of isolated DNA were determined by dry Cerenkov counting and equal numbers of counts were loaded onto 10% sequencing gels. Dried gels were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager. DNA footprinting data suggest that the stable binding between the ADP·AlFx associated form of PspF1–275 (PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx) and promoter-bound σ54 or σ54-RNAP changes the DNA interactions made by σ54 or σ54-RNAP (13Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). 2W. Cannon and M. Buck, unpublished data. To further explore these alterations in DNA interactions we analyzed the ability of σ54 and σ54-RNAP to bind a range of S. melitloti nifH promoter probes (that mimicked the conformation of the DNA within closed promoter complexes) by native-PAGE in the absence and presence of PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx. The promoter probes differed in the template strand sequence in the region of heteroduplex at the –12/–11 fork junction (Fig. 1a). As shown in Fig. 1a, σ54 does not detectably bind to promoter probes with mutant or missing template strand sequences at position –12 (probes 2–9; Ref. 11Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, strong binding of σ54 and σ54-RNAP was evident on probe 1, which contains wild-type template strand sequences within the heteroduplex segment (Table Ia and Fig. 1, a and b, respectively). Strikingly, in the presence of PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx, the binding activity of σ54 to probes 2, 7, and 8 was significantly increased, suggesting that the stable complex formation between σ54 and PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx (hereafter called the trapped σ54) has altered the DNA-binding activity of σ54 (Fig. 1a). Similarly, the promoter DNA-binding activity of the σ54-RNAP was altered in the presence of PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx. As shown in Fig. 1b, we found that the PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx-bound form of σ54-RNAP (hereafter called the trapped σ54-RNAP) bound to probes 2, 4, 7, and 8 more efficiently than the untrapped σ54-RNAP. Overall, the results clearly demonstrate an apparent activator-dependent change in the DNA-binding activity of σ54 and σ54-RNAP that critically involves PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 1, a and b, the binding of σ54 and σ54-RNAP to the promoter probe with wild-type template sequences at positions –12 and –11 (probe 1) was unchanged in the presence of PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx, suggesting that the activator does not interact to produce an overall general increase in DNA binding. Rather, a change in binding activity is evident only on certain heteroduplex promoter probes. Controls where ADP·AlFx or PspF1–275 was omitted showed that the change in DNA-binding activity was specific to conditions that led to formation of the stable association of PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx with σ54 or σ54-RNAP (data not shown). A hallmark of σ54-RNAP open complexes is their stability in the presence of heparin. The trapped σ54-RNAP complex bound to promoter probes 1–9 were no more heparin-stable than σ54-RNAP promoter complexes, indicating that the complexes had not fully isomerized to acquire heparin stability, but rather might represent an intermediate state (data not shown). DNA footprinting data on promoter probe 1 have established that compared with the binary σ54-DNA complexes, ADP·AlFx-dependent trapped σ54-DNA complexes have extended DNase I footprints toward the transcription start site, as do ATP hydrolysis-dependent isomerized binary σ54-DNA complexes (11Cannon W. Gallegos M.T. Buck M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 13Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W. Casaz P. Gallegos M.T. Schumacher J. Jones S. Elderkin S. Dago A.E. Morett E. Buck M. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). This indicates that the extended σ54-DNA interactions occur in response to interactions with certain nucleotide-bound forms of the activator. We used the promoter probe with the mutant template strand sequence (GT at positions –12 and –11 instead of TG; probe 2), to which trapped σ54 and σ54-RNAP bound most efficiently (Fig. 1) to further examine the increased DNA binding functionality of trapped σ54 and σ54-RNAP. By using a series of shortened variants of promoter probe 2 (probes 2A–2F; Table II), we explored whether the changed DNA-binding activity seen above (Fig. 1) relied upon the transcription start site proximal DNA sequences. As shown in Table II, increased binding of the trapped σ54 and trapped σ54-RNAP complexes to promoter probes that extend downstream of (and including) position –1 occurred (probes 2A–2D). However, no increased binding activity of trapped σ54 and trapped σ54-RNAP to promoter probes lacking sequences downstream of the –1 position was observed (Table II). This suggests that sequences upstream of –1 are required for the increased binding activity of the trapped σ54 and σ54-RNAP complex to promoter probe 2. Furthermore, binding assays with promoter probes 2G and 2H demonstrated that the DNA between positions –3 and –1 had to be in duplex form.Table IIContribution of promoter sequences to the binding activities of σ54 or Eσ54 to DNA probe 2 in response to nucleotide-bound forms of the AAA domain of PspF (PspF1-275)Probe 2 variantsProbe nameσ54-DNAaExpressed as % promoter probe complexed with σ54 and σ54-RNAP and trapped versions thereof.Trapped σ54-DNAaExpressed as % promoter probe complexed with σ54 and σ54-RNAP and trapped versions thereof.Eσ54-DNAaExpressed as % promoter probe complexed with σ54 and σ54-RNAP and trapped versions thereof.Trapped Eσ54-DNAaExpressed as % promoter probe complexed with σ54 and σ54-RNAP and trapped versions thereof.ATPγS complexaExpressed as % promoter probe complexed with σ54 and σ54-RNAP and trapped versions thereof.-60 to +28Probe 2<32226379-35 to +6Probe 2A<31210376-35 to +3Probe 2B<3911303-35 to +1Probe 2C<381831<3-35 to -1Probe 2D<3122432<3-35 to -2Probe 2E<342415<3-35 to -3Probe 2F<342711<3-35 to T-3bThis promoter probe contains a double-stranded segment from -35 to -3 and a single-stranded top strand segment from -1 to -3.Probe 2G<3<3187NDdND, not determined.-35 to B-1cThis promoter probe contains a double stranded segment from -35 to -3 and a single-stranded bottom stranded segment from -1 to -3.Probe 2H<3<31710NDdND, not determined.a Expressed as % promoter probe complexed with σ54 and σ54-RNAP and trapped versions thereof.b This promoter probe contains a double-stranded segment from -35 to -3 and a single-stranded top strand segment from -1 to -3.c This promoter probe contains a double stranded segment from -35 to -3 and a single-stranded bottom stranded segment from -1 to -3.d ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab OP-Cu is a minor groove-specific DNA cleaving reagent that has been widely used to study σ54-RNAP interactions with the –12 promoter region (6Morris L. Cannon W.

Chem. 2003; 278: 3455-3465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In closed promoter complexes formed with the σ54-RNAP on homoduplex promoter probe (Table Ia), the minor groove at the –12 position is distorted and thus is susceptible to cleavage by OP-Cu (6Morris L. Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). OP-Cu-mediated DNA cleavage at this position is not evident in open promoter complexes suggesting that the distortion distinguishes closed and open promoter complexes (6Morris L. Cannon W. Claverie-Martin F. Austin S. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11563-11571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We used OP-Cu footprinting to probe whether binding of trapped σ54 and trapped σ54-RNAP to promoter probe 2 changes σ54 interactions with the fork junction structure at –12. To do so, we formed promoter complexes with σ54 and σ54-RNAP on probe 2 in the absence and presence of PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx, treated them with OP-Cu, and separated the probe 2 bound and unbound complexes by native-PAGE. Promoter complexes were excised from native gels, the DNA was isolated and analyzed by denaturing-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2, OP-Cu treatment of naked promoter probe 2 revealed a hypersensitive site around position –12 (lane 2), as expected because of the heteroduplex segment at this position (Table Ia). This hypersensitive site was also evident in the weak complexes formed between σ54 or σ54-RNAP and probe 2 in the absence of PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). This is striking because the OP-Cu-mediated DNA cleavage at –12 is significantly reduced in complexes formed between σ54 or σ54-RNAP and probe 1 (which contains wild-type template strand sequences in the heteroduplex segment; Table Ia) because of the tight binding of σ54 or σ54-RNAP to this heteroduplex segment (19Wigneshweraraj S.R. Kuznedelov K. Severinov K. Buck M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3455-3465Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Interestingly, analysis of the complexes formed between trapped σ54 or trapped σ54-RNAP and probe 2 showed that the DNA cleavage around position –12 is strongly reduced (Fig. 2, compare lanes 3 and 4 with 5 and 6). Thus, the footprinting data establishes that σ54 and σ54-RNAP interactions near the –12 promoter region are altered in the presence of PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx. To increase our understanding of how new functional states of PspF1–275 are created by nucleotide interactions, we explored whether changes in DNA-binding activity of σ54 and σ54-RNAP in the presence of PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx are seen with other nucleotides. The poorly or non-hydrolyzable forms of ATP, ATPγS, and adenosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate (AMP-PNP) do not support productive open complex formation by σ54-RNAP (20Popham D.L. Szeto D. Keener J. Kustu S. Science. 1989; 243: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), but could influence prior steps. We compared the functional states of PspF1–275 bound to ADP·AlFx, ATPγS, or AMP-PNP in assays using promoter probes 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). Strikingly, the presence of the ATPγS-bound form of PspF1–275 (PspF1–275-ATPγS) resulted in the formation of a novel complex on promoter probe 2 only (Fig. 3, lane 13). Interestingly, the novel complex migrated considerably faster than the trapped σ54-DNA complex and thus appeared to differ significantly from the latter (Fig. 3, compare lanes 12 and 13). The addition of AMP-PNP, ATP, or GTP did not substitute for ATPγS in formation of the ATPγS-dependent complex on promoter probe 2 (Fig. 3 and data not shown). The complex (hereafter called the ATPγS complex), like the trapped σ54-DNA complex relied upon promoter sequences between positions –3 and –1 (Table II). Thus, these initial results demonstrate that a new σ54-DNA complex can be obtained that is dependent upon a certain fork junction structure at position –12 and PspF1–275-ATPγS. At high concentrations of σ54 and promoter probe 2, we observed a weak σ54-DNA complex that formed independently of PspF1–275-ADP·AlFx or PspF1–275-ATPγS. This binary σ54-DNA complex migrated faster than the trapped σ54-DNA complex and the ATPγS-dependent complex (data not shown). Using activators of different molecular weights (full-length PspF1–325, PspF1–292, PspF1–275, and heart muscle kinase-tagged PspF1–292), we obtained no evidence that the ATPγS-complex was a ternary complex containing the activator (data not shown). We were also unable to demonstrate the presence of 32P-PspF1–292 in the ATPγS-complex in reactions where sensitivity was not limiting (data not shown). From these results we conclude that PspF1–275-ATPγS enables σ54 to bind promoter probe 2 and form a stable binary complex that does not depend on the stable association of PspF1–275. Because the formation of the ATPγS-complex and the trapped σ54-DNA complex relied upon promoter probe 2 and was independent of the order of addition of σ54, DNA, or PspF1–275 (data not shown), we suggest that the PspF1–275-ATPγS interacts transiently with σ54 to change the DNA binding functionality of σ54. The ADP·AlFx and ATPγS forms of PspF1–275 are therefore distinct in that only the ADP·AlFx-bound PspF1–275 forms a stable complex with σ54 (13Chaney M. Grande R. Wigneshweraraj S.R. Cannon W.

Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), but both share the property of altering the DNA-binding activity of σ54 on promoter probe 2. We investigated the requirements for ATPγS-complex formation. Initial experiments in which increasing amounts of ATP, ADP, AMP, (NH4)2SO4 (to mimic the PO4 at the point of ATP hydrolysis), AMP-PNP, guanosine 5′-(γ-thio)triphosphate (GTPγS), or ATPγS were present demonstrated that ATPγS-complex formation was specific to the γS forms of the trinucleotide (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4a, the amount of ATPγS-complex formation increased with ATPγS, and saturated at 1 mm ATPγS (20% ATPγS-complex). Increased σ54-DNA binding was also observed when ATPγS was substituted with GTPγS (data not shown), although ATPγS was the most effective in promoting binding of σ54 to promoter probe 2 (∼5-fold better than GTPγS). The amount of ATPγS-complex formation also titrated with PspF1–275 and σ54 (Fig. 4, b and c, respectively). Increasing amounts of DNA did not increase the fraction of DNA in the ATPγS-dependent complex, suggesting that PspF1–275-ATPγS acts on free σ54 and not on its promoter DNA-bound form (data not shown). Furthermore, ATPγS-complex formation was dependent upon the integrity of the GAFTGA motif of PspF1–275 (residues 83–88), a signature motif in the AAA domain of σ54 activators, which is involved in direct binding interactions with σ54 (11Cannon W.

https://openalex.org/W2109029295,"In F-ATPases, ATP hydrolysis is coupled to translocation of ions through membranes by rotation of a ring of c subunits in the membrane. The ring is attached to a central shaft that penetrates the catalytic domain, which has pseudo-3-fold symmetry. The ion translocation pathway lies between the external circumference of the ring and another hydrophobic protein. The H<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup>:ATP ratio depends upon the number of ring protomers, each of which has an essential carboxylate involved directly in ion translocation. This number and the ratio differ according to the source, and 10, 11, and 14 protomers have been found in various enzymes, with corresponding calculated H<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup>:ATP ratios of 3.3, 3.7, and 4.7. V-ATPases are related in structure and function to F-ATPases. Oligomers of subunit K from the Na<sup>+</sup>-motive V-ATPase of <i>Enterococcus hirae</i> also form membrane rings but, as reported here, with 7-fold symmetry. Each protomer has one essential carboxylate. Thus, hydrolysis of one ATP provides energy to extrude 2.3 sodium ions. Symmetry mismatch between the catalytic and membrane domains appears to be an intrinsic feature of both V- and F-ATPases."

Therefore, we propose a new model for α1-PI polymer.

The physiologically active form of a serpin has a metastable conformation, which is essential for its normal inhibitory function (14Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Sidhar S. Foreman R.

A critical structural element of a serpin is its mobile reactive center loop (RCL), exposed on the serpin surface, which normally targets the active site of the cognate serine protease. Upon binding of the serpin to the protease, a tight binary complex forms, the RCL is cleaved, and the segment of the cleaved RCL remaining in the N-terminal portion of the serpin inserts between central strands of the A β-sheet (16Schreuder H.A. de Boer B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5282-5288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The metastability of a serpin that confers its inhibitory potential also renders it more susceptible to conformational changes, arising from a mutation, that promote its polymerization. Crucial positions implicated in α1-PI polymerization are found in the hinge region of the RCL in the common Z variant (E342K) (2Jeppsson J.-O. FEBS Lett. 1976; 65: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) and in the hydrophobic core of two rare variants, Mmalton (22Fraizer G.C. Harrold T.R. Hofker M.H. Cox D.W. Am. J. Hum.

However, EM data demonstrate that these polymers are linear. Several models of polymerization have been proposed with each assuming an interaction between the RCL of one molecule and a β-sheet in an adjacent molecule. The crystal structures of antithrombin dimer (24Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R.

However, no direct structural evidence exists supporting the widely accepted model (26Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.-B. Eur. J.

All models of α1-PI polymerization proposed thus far assume a head-to-tail arrangement of monomers forming a linear chain. Here, we show that α1-PI can assemble in a different manner to form linear polymers. We have studied polymerization of disulfide-linked (head-to-head) α1-PI dimer, which forms under mild denaturing conditions in the absence of reducing agent. This dimer, after folding, spontaneously polymerizes giving rise to linear polymers that appear to be multimers of dimer without any involvement of folded monomer, if present. None of the previously proposed models of polymerization appears able to accommodate the observed polymerization of this disulfide-linked dimer. Protein and Peptides—α1-PI, purified from pooled plasma, was a gift from the Aventis Behring Corp. This material, obtained frozen, was thawed and dialyzed into the standard buffer that consisted of 20 mm sodium phosphate and 130 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. The resulting ∼700 μm α1-PI stock solution was stored in small aliquots at –70 °C. α1-PI consisted of 99% monomer and 1% dimer, as determined by SE-HPLC analysis, and showed full inhibitory activity against bovine pancreatic trypsin. The inhibitory activity of α1-PI was determined by measuring the decrease in the steady state activity of the trypsin (with the substrate N-benzoyl-l-arginine p-nitroanalide hydrochloride, Ref. 28Erlanger B.F. Kokowsky N. Cohen W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1961; 95: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (2867) Google Scholar) caused by preincubation of the protease with α1-PI. The active concentration of the trypsin was determined with the active site titrant p-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride (29Chase Jr., T. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar). The Mr of the α1-PI monomer was 50,600 and that of the dimer was 101,000, as determined by MALDI-TOF analysis. The extent of glycosylation was 12.5% based on a Mw of 44,300 for the unglycosylated protein, calculated from the frequency of occurrence and sequence of each of the four major variants. The A2800.1% for the α1-PI preparation was 0.431 and was determined by differential refractometry at 546 nm by using (dn/dc)546 values of 0.186 and 0.142 ml/g for the protein (30Doty P.

The RCL peptide of α1-PI (nP14), TEAAGAMFLEAIPM (i.e. Thr345–Met358), and a control peptide (cP14), EAPFTALEMGAMAI, designed by scrambling the sequence of the RCL peptide, both N-acetylated, were synthesized at the CBER Facility for Biotechnology Resources. Reagents and Solutions—GdnHCl (99+%), anhydrous dibasic sodium phosphate, bovine pancreatic trypsin, N-benzoyl-l-arginine p-nitroanalide hydrochloride, p-nitrophenyl p′-guanidinobenzoate hydrochloride, d-mannose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine, β-mercaptoethanol, bovine serum albumin (molecular weight marker for non-denaturing PAGE), and iodoacetamide (SigmaUltra) were from Sigma Chemical Co. Monobasic sodium phosphate was from Fisher Biochemical, and sodium chloride was from J. T. Baker. All chemicals were ACS reagent grade. All GdnHCl solutions were prepared in the standard buffer. A concentrated stock solution of GdnHCl was prepared, and the concentration was determined by differential refractometry (34Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) at 546 nm. Concentrations of all diluted solutions were determined on the basis of weight by utilizing appropriate measured densities. PAGE—PAGE was performed by using the Mini-PROTEAN® system of Bio-Rad with 7.5% Tris-HCl gels under both non-reducing and reducing, denaturing (SDS) conditions and under non-reducing, non-denaturing conditions. Simply BlueTM SafeStain (Invitrogen) was used to detect protein. SE-HPLC and SE-FPLC—Analytical SE-HPLC was performed on the System Gold® HPLC system of Beckmann Corp., controlled with 32 Karat Work station software and equipped with two TosoHaas TSK-3000SWXL columns (5 μm, 7.8 mm × 30 cm) connected in series and an SWXL guard column. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the absorbance was monitored at 280 and 215 nm; the latter was used for quantitative analysis. α1-PI dimer was purified by SE-FPLC with an Amersham Biosciences HiLoad® 16/60 Superdex 200 preparative grade column, by using a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm. Polymerization—Prior to polymerization, α1-PI dimer solutions were concentrated with microconcentrators (Amicon/Millipore) with a molecular weight cut-off of 30,000. All polymerization of disulfide-linked dimer was performed in buffer in the absence of reducing agent at protein concentrations and temperatures as indicated under “Results.” Polymerization of monomer was performed in 1.4 m GdnHCl at 25 °C or by heating in buffer in the presence and absence of 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol at 55 and 65 °C to generate polymer controls (see Figs. 4 and 8).Fig. 8Electron micrographs of α1-PI dimer, dimer polymerized in the absence and presence of RCL peptide, and polymerized α1-PI monomer.

A 10-μl drop of each solution to be examined was placed onto a carbon-coated electron microscope grid for 2 min. The grid was blotted with filter paper, stained for 2 min with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate solution, and air-dried. The prepared grid was examined with a Philips CM120 transmission electron microscope equipped with a LaB6 filament and operated at 120 kV. Images were recorded at magnifications in the range of 3–60 k with a Gatan Multi-Scan 794 CCD camera by using DigitalMicrograph 3.4.4 software. Image processing was done with Adobe PhotoShop 5.5 software. Further Polymerization of Folded Intermediates—Unlike mutant forms of α1-PI, the normal form of the monomer, used in this study, although a metastable form, does not spontaneously polymerize at ≤37 °C (35Lomas D.A.

Normal monomer must be partially unfolded by treatment with a low level of denaturant or by heating to induce polymerization. Previous unfolding studies of normal α1-PI monomer suggest the existence of an intermediate state at 1–2 m GdnHCl at 25 °C (36Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol.

Shrake A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) that further polymerize more slowly to form higher oligomers. The time course of polymerization of α1-PI in 1.5 m GdnHCl over 1 h analyzed by SE-HPLC in 1.5 m GdnHCl shows the progressive partial unfolding and decrease in the amount of monomer and increase in the amount of dimer and higher polymers (Ref. 39Tran S.T. Shrake A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar and Fig. 4, A–E). However, the quantitation of partially unfolded intermediates by SE-HPLC in GdnHCl is difficult due to variable recovery of these species from the column. The species formed from 50 μm monomer after 3 h in 1.4 m GdnHCl at 25 °C in the absence of reducing agent were diluted 10-fold with buffer, allowed to fold for 16 h at 25 °C, and then analyzed by SE-HPLC in buffer; α1-PI monomer, dimer, and some larger polymers were detected (Fig. 1, lower tracing). Significantly, during further incubation (for 499 h) of these folded species in buffer at 25 °C (Fig. 1, upper tracing), the amount of monomer remained unchanged whereas the level of high molecular weight species increased primarily at the expense of dimer. Since dimer was the smallest species involved in further polymerization of the folded intermediates, we isolated folded dimer in order to study its polymerization. Throughout this article, the concentrations of all α1-PI species, e.g. dimer, are expressed in terms of monomer. Preparation and Properties of Dimer—To induce polymerization, 50 μm α1-PI monomer was incubated in 1.4 m GdnHCl at 25 °C for 3 h, and the resulting intermediate species were folded by 10-fold dilution with buffer and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Folded dimer was isolated by a two-step SE-FPLC purification procedure and characterized by SE-HPLC (Fig. 2A), SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2B), and native PAGE (Fig. 2C). The dimer stock solutions contained ≥96% dimer and trace amounts of tetramer (1.0–2.5%) and monomer (1.2–1.8%) (Fig. 2A). Non-reducing SDS-PAGE of purified dimer shows a dimer band with a trace of monomer (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2, 0.2 and 0.5 μg of dimer, respectively) whereas reducing SDS-PAGE shows only a monomer band (Fig. 2B, lanes 4 and 5) thereby demonstrating that essentially all the purified dimer was disulfide linked. An α1-PI monomer control, containing a trace of dimer, shows the position of the monomer band under non-reducing and reducing conditions (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 6, respectively). To verify that the disulfide bond forms in GdnHCl, polymerization of monomer was carried out, as before, in 1.4 m GdnHCl at 25 °C for 3 h in the absence and presence of the sulfhydryl blocking agent iodoacetamide added at various times during polymerization at a 7-fold molar excess. After polymerization and refolding by dilution with buffer, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). In Fig. 3, lane 1 is unpolymerized monomer (control), containing a trace of dimer, lane 2 is a sample polymerized in the absence of blocking agent, and lanes 3–5 are samples treated with blocking agent at 1, 2, and 3 h after the initiation of polymerization. Lane 6 is a sample of material obtained after polymerization of monomer that was blocked for1hat37 °C prior to the initiation of polymerization. This sample shows that the amount of dimer did not increase (relative to that in unpolymerized monomer, lane 1) during incubation of blocked monomer in GdnHCl in contrast to the substantial amount of dimer obtained in the absence of blocking agent (lane 2). Furthermore, for the samples treated with blocking agent during polymerization, increasing amounts of dimer were obtained with increasing incubation time in GdnHCl prior to the addition of blocking agent (lanes 3, 4, and 5, respectively). The sample in lane 5 was treated with blocking agent at the end of the 3-h polymerization, and the amount of dimer is comparable to that obtained in the absence of blocking agent (lane 2). All dimers observed in Fig. 3 were completely dissociated in SDS in the presence of reducing agent (data not shown) thereby showing that they were disulfide-linked. These results demonstrate that the disulfide bond of the dimer forms between partially unfolded monomers in 1.4 m GdnHCl. The disulfide-linked dimer did not show inhibitory activity against porcine elastase. 2X. Du, unpublished result. Stock solutions of dimer (0.5–0.7 μM) were stored at 4 °C; under such conditions, dimer polymerizes very slowly. During storage for 2 months at 4 °C, <10% of the dimer polymerized with the formation of tetramer. To assess the compactness of the α1-PI dimer, we have considered its hydrodynamic properties. The SE-HPLC elution volumes for the monomer and dimer of α1-PI are slightly greater than those for the monomer and dimer constituents of a BSA molecular weight marker for non-denaturing PAGE (data not shown). This observation is consistent with the lower molecular weights of the monomer and dimer of α1-PI (Mr 50,600 and Mr 101,000) relative to those of the BSA standard (Mr 66,000 and Mr 132,000). PAGE analysis of the α1-PI dimer and monomer and of the BSA standard under non-denaturing conditions (Fig. 2C) shows that the migration distance of α1-PI dimer is slightly less than that of BSA dimer. However, this small difference between dimers is a reflection of the slightly shorter migration distance of α1-PI monomer relative to that of the BSA monomer (Fig. 2C). Preliminary far UV CD and intrinsic protein fluorescence spectra (not shown) were used to estimate the extent of structural perturbation of the α1-PI monomer within the disulfide-linked dimer and indicate a substantial retention of structure. A deconvolution of the CD data with CDPro software (40CDPro Software Package, lamar.colostate.edu/~sreeram/CDPro (September 27, 2002)Google Scholar), which uses three algorithms (41Sreerama N.

Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1857) Google Scholar), gives similar changes in secondary structure for the monomer within the dimer relative to free monomer for a given set of protein reference spectra. However, the use of three standard reference sets shows retention of ∼100% β-sheet and ∼86% α-helix whereas the use of two other sets shows a retention of ∼82% β-sheet and ∼84% α-helix. Fluorescence emission spectra with excitation at 280 or 295 nm show an increase of ≤1 nm in the emission maximum of dimer relative to that of monomer. With excitation at 295 nm, the shift of the maximum for the intermediate state in 1.5 m GdnHCl is ∼5 nm and that for the fully unfolded state in 7 m GdnHCl is ∼20 nm (39Tran S.T. Shrake A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 385: 322-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). These results indicate minimal perturbation of the fluorophore environment in the dimer. Therefore, electrophoretic and chromatographic results demonstrate that the disulfide-linked dimer is a compact structure, and the CD and fluorescence measurements suggest a substantial retention of secondary and tertiary structure by the monomer within the dimer. Polymerization of Dimer—0.5 μm α1-PI dimer was concentrated to 9.2 μm and polymerized by incubation at 37 °C (to accelerate polymerization) for 24 h. As the control, 50 μm monomer was polymerized by heating at 55 °C for 2 h in the absence and presence of 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. Native PAGE analysis of the products of polymerization of monomer in the absence and presence of reducing agent shows a ladder of species consisting of multiples of monomer (Fig. 4, lanes 4 and 5, respectively) with the latter showing sharper bands; the former shows a much weaker pentamer band, and this observation suggests that polymerization under non-reducing conditions may, in part, involve polymerization of initially formed dimer. The ladder of species obtained for the polymerized dimer in the absence of reducing agent (Fig. 4, lane 3) shows no trimer or pentamer bands and only a faint band of monomer, which is a trace impurity in the dimer preparation. Unpolymerized control samples of monomer and dimer each show the single, anticipated band (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2, respectively). Dimer was concentrated and then incubated at concentrations of 1, 11, 21, and 50 μm at 37 °C (Fig. 5A) and also at a concentration of 21 μm at 4, 25, 37, and 41 °C (Fig. 5B). Concentrating at 4 °C causes some polymerization of the dimer. Thus, samples analyzed immediately after concentration (at t = 0) had decreased levels of dimer relative to that of the initial stock solution (0.5 μm) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). During incubation at 37 °C, the amount of dimer decreased, the amount of tetramer increased, and substantial levels of higher oligomers were formed. For example, compare the SE-HPLC traces of 50 μm protein before and after incubation for 50 h at 37 °C (Fig. 5, C and D, respectively). The initial rate of dimer polymerization increased with increase in concentration and in temperature (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). The polymers formed from the dimer were stable because they did not dissociate upon dilution even with further incubation and showed only very slight dissociation upon treatment with 1% β-mercaptoethanol (data not shown). Effect of RCL Peptide on Polymerization of α1-PI Dimer— Lack of polymerization of α1-PI monomer complexed with RCL peptide was an important observation leading to the proposition that α1-PI polymerizes by the insertion of the RCL of one molecule into the A β-sheet of another (26Schulze A.J. Baumann U. Knof S. Jaeger E. Huber R. Laurell C.-B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 51-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Lomas D.A. Evans D.Ll. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Nature. 1992; 357: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated the effect of an RCL peptide on the polymerization of α1-PI dimer using a peptide, nP14, with the sequence of residues 345–358 of the RCL of α1-PI and a control peptide, cP14, with a s"

https://openalex.org/W2060344093,"ART2a (RT6.1) and ART2b (RT6.2) are NAD glycohydrolases (NADases) that are linked to T lymphocytes by glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors. Although both mature proteins possess three conserved regions (I, II, III) that form the NAD-binding site and differ by only ten amino acids, only ART2b is auto-ADP-ribosylated and only ART2a is glycosylated. To investigate the structural basis for these differences, wild-type and mutant ART2a and ART2b were expressed in rat mammary adenocarcinoma (NMU) cells and released with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C. All mutants were immunoreactive NADases. Arginine 204 (Arg204), NH2-terminal to essential glutamate 209 in Region III, is found in ART2b, but not ART2a. Replacement of Arg204 in ART2b with lysine, tyrosine, or glutamate abolished auto-ADP-ribosylation. Unlike wild-type ART2a, ART2a(Y204R) was auto-ADP-ribosylated. The tryptophan mutant ART2b(R204W) was auto-ADP-ribosylated and exhibited enhanced NADase activity. Incubation with NAD and auto-ADP-ribosylation decreased the NADase activities of wild-type ART2b and ART2b (R204W), whereas activity of ART2b(R204K), which is not auto-modified, was unchanged by NAD. Facilitation of auto-ADP-ribosylation by tryptophan 204 suggests that the hydrophobic amino acid mimics an ADP-ribosylated arginine. Thus, Arg204 in ART2b serves as a regulatory switch whose presence is required for additional auto-ADP-ribosylation and regulation of catalytic activity."

The experiments described in this article begin to identify the interaction of the SH3 domain of Src tyrosine kinase with the guanylyl cyclase C receptor after activation with Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin (ST). Only one of two post-translationally modified forms of guanylyl cyclase C from T84 colonic carcinoma cells bind to GST-SH3 fusion protein of Src and Hck tyrosine kinases.

The SH3 domain was originally found in the amino-terminal, non-catalytic half of pp60Src, and it seems to play dual roles in signal transduction, through stabilizing the repressed form of the Src kinase and through mediating the formation of activated signaling complexes. More than 50 SH3 domains are known to date distributed in several classes of proteins, including enzymes (e.g. PLCγ, Ras-GAP, and the p85 subunit of PI3K), tyrosine phosphatases (e.g. PTP1C, Syp), adaptor proteins (Grb2, Nck and Crk), and cytoskeletal proteins (e.g. cortactin, myosin 1B, spectrin) (4Mayer B.

Initial studies on protein-protein interactions mediated by the SH3 domain indicated lack of specificity; however, studies using peptide libraries have shown that the SH3 domain exhibits distinct binding preferences (7Rickles R.J.

Although SH3 domain-mediated protein-protein interactions are well documented, we still need to understand the physiological significance of such interactions. Receptor guanylyl cyclase C (GCC) is a member of the diverse family of transmembrane guanylyl cyclase receptors found in mammals as well as in lower eukaryotes. In mammals there are six membrane forms (GC-A–F); ligands are known for GCA, GCB (natriuretic peptides), GCC, the retinal and olfactory cyclases GCD, GCE, and GCF (13Garbers D.L. Methods. 1999; 19: 477-484Google Scholar, 14Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S. Chepenik K.P. Waldman S.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 375-414Google Scholar). Guanylin and related peptide uroguanylin are the endogenous ligands of GCC (15Forte L.R. Currie M.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 643-650Google Scholar, 16Forte L.R. Regul. Pept. 1999; 81: 25-39Google Scholar). Escherichia coli heat-stable enterotoxin ST binds to GCC and results in imbalance in the secretion of fluids and ions culminating in a form of severe secretory diarrhea (17Field M. Rao M.C.

Elevated levels of cGMP in response to the ST peptide probably cross-activate cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) leading to phosphorylation and subsequent opening of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (22Vaandrager A.B. Bot. A.G. De Jonge H.R. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 437-443Google Scholar), as well as through the cross-activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (23Chao C.A. De Sauvage F.J. Dong Y.J. Wagner J.A. Goeddel D.V. Gardner P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1065-1072Google Scholar). Upon prolonged exposure to ST, the GCC receptor expressed in T84 cells becomes refractory or desensitized to the presence of ST as implicit in the transient nature of enterotoxin ST-mediated diarrhea (24Bakre M.M. Ghanekar Y. Visweswariah S.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 179-187Google Scholar, 25Bakre M.M. Visweswariah S.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 345-349Google Scholar). The factors contributing to the induction of ST-mediated desensitization caused by the reduction in the catalytic activity of GCC are still not known. The activation of type 5 cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase has been found to regulate the levels of second messenger (cGMP) and contribute to the desensitization of the GCC receptor (24Bakre M.M. Ghanekar Y. Visweswariah S.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 179-187Google Scholar, 25Bakre M.M. Visweswariah S.S. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 345-349Google Scholar). However, the homologous desensitization in vivo was observed to be different from the inactivation of the GCC receptor in vitro, and the desensitization of GCC was found to be a cell-specific phenomenon (24Bakre M.M. Ghanekar Y. Visweswariah S.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 179-187Google Scholar). To study the signal transduction mechanisms of GCC receptor, T84 human colonic carcinoma cell line was used as a model system (24Bakre M.M. Ghanekar Y. Visweswariah S.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 179-187Google Scholar). T84 cell line resembles mature intestinal epithelial cells morphologically. It shows vectorial ion transport across the apical and the basolateral membrane. T84 cell line has been shown to express a single class of GCC receptor with high affinity (Kd, 0.1 nm) for ST. On prolonged exposure to ST (18 h) T84 cells show desensitization, i.e. there is decrease in the production of cGMP, and it also shows refractoriness to fresh stimulation to ST. The cDNA for GCC has been cloned and its receptor characterized from human colonic cell lines (26Visweswariah S.S. Ramachandran V. Ramamohan S. Das G. Ramachandran J. Eur. J.

Recombinant GCC has properties similar to native intestinal guanylyl cyclase, and like the other membrane-bound cyclases (GCA and GCB), it contains an extracellular receptor domain, a transmembrane domain, an intracellular protein kinase-like domain, and a guanylyl cyclase domain. GCC contains a unique carboxyl-terminal tail that presumably anchors the receptor to the cytoskeleton in epithelial cells (14Lucas K.A. Pitari G.M. Kazerounian S. Ruiz-Stewart I. Park J. Schulz S.

The data presented here show that the SH3 domain of Src tyrosine kinase interacts with the GCC receptor via the catalytic domain resulting in decreased cyclase activity. The physiological significance of such interactions is further characterized, and the novel observations reported here do indeed suggest yet another mechanism of receptor desensitization.

The cell pellets were rinsed in cold PBS (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3). After sonication, the cell lysates (in PBS pH 7.3 with 0.1% Triton X-100) were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatants were then mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences). The fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione prepared in 200 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH. 8.0), dialyzed to remove the glutathione. Protein concentration was measured by modified Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). Culture and Maintenance of T84 Cells—T84 cells were obtained from ATCC (CCL 247), and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium: F12 containing 5% newborn calf serum, penicillin (120 mg/liter), and streptomycin (270 mg/ml) as described earlier (32Visweswariah S.S. Santhi G. Balganesh T.S. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 12: 209-218Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 6-cm dishes and were used at 95% confluency unless otherwise described. Preparation of Membranes from T84 Cells—Membranes were prepared from confluent monolayers of T84 cells cultured in 6-cm dishes. Briefly, cells were harvested by scraping into homogenization buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 nm okadaic acid, and 10 nm sodium orthovanadate). Cells were sonicated in above buffer, and the broken cell suspension was subjected to 11,200 × g centrifugation for 1 h, at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was resuspended in interaction buffer (50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5 containing 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C for solubilization of membrane proteins. After centrifugation at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min, the supernatant was used for binding assays, pull-down assay, and co-immunoprecipitations. Co-precipitation of Native GCC with GST-SH3 Domain—T84 cells were harvested and membrane preparation was solubilized in 20 mm HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin for 1 h at 4 °C. The solubilized receptor preparation was treated with either GST (5 μg of protein) as a control or GST-SH3 (5 μg of protein) domains of Src and Hck immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 25 °C with constant shaking. The proteins bound to GST-SH3 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with GCC-specific monoclonal antibodies (GCC:C8). Equivalent aliquots of the solubilized receptor preparation were used for immunoprecipitation with GCC-specific polyclonal antibodies. Co-precipitation of Native GCC with GST-Src-SH3 Domain After Treatment of T84 Cells with ST—Confluent culture of T84 cells in 6-cm dishes were treated with ST peptide (3 × 10–7m) in serum-free medium for 15 min and 18 h. At the end of incubation, the cells were harvested, and membrane proteins were extracted as described earlier in this section. An equivalent amount of membrane proteins from control and ST-treated T84 cells (15 min and 18 h) were incubated with GST-SH3 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. The proteins bound to GST-SH3 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with GCC-specific monoclonal antibodies (GCC:C8). An equivalent aliquot of the solubilized receptor preparation was used for immunoprecipitation with GCC-specific polyclonal antibodies. Western Blot Analysis—T84 cell membrane proteins (50 μg) and the immunoprecipitates obtained with GCC as described earlier were fractionated on 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane in 25 mm Tris pH 8.3, 190 mm glycine, containing 20% methanol, for 2 h at 200 mA. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 5% blocking reagent for 1 h at room temperature, following which the membrane was washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with purified IgG (1:200) prepared from monoclonal antibody GCC:C8 in PBS, pH 7.2 containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 and/or Src monoclonal antibody (1:1000) prepared in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.5 containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20. Nitrocellulose membranes were subsequently washed in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) and further incubated with anti-mouse horseradish peroxide conjugate (1:3000 diluted in PBS/TBS containing 0.2% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20) for 1 h. The presence of bound antibody was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reaction using the ECL Plus kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Metabolic Labeling of Proteins with [35S]Methionine—T84 cells were grown to 70% confluency in a 6-cm dish and were washed twice with cysteine and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. After preincubation in the medium for 1 h, cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 5 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 5 h. At the end of the incubation, cells were harvested, and proteins were extracted from the membrane fraction in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm PMSF, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1% Triton X-100. Immunoprecipitation of GCC was done with GCC-specific polyclonal antibody followed by fractionation on SDS-PAGE followed by PPO fluorography (33Laskey R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 363-371Google Scholar). Briefly, to perform fluorography, the gel was fixed with 50% methanol and 10% acetic acid for 4 h followed by treatment with graded dilutions of acetic acid for 10 min each in 25%, 50%, and glacial acetic acid. After treatment with 20% PPO in glacial acetic acid gel was kept in distilled water for 2 h until it was uniformly impregnated with PPO (uniform white color). The gel was dried at 65 °C and then exposed to x-ray film. Immunoprecipitation of GCC from T84 Membrane Extracts—Interaction of GCC with other proteins was studied by co-immunoprecipitation. Cells were harvested from 6-cm dishes, and the membrane extracts were prepared from control, 15 min, and 18 h ST (3 × 10–7m)-treated T84 cells in 20 mm Tris-HCl 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA. A mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin) was also included. The T84 membrane extracts were precleared by incubation with 1 μl of normal mouse serum/normal rabbit serum respectively and 10 μl of protein A-agarose (Sigma) beads for 1 h at 4 °C by gentle mixing. The mixture was briefly centrifuged to remove the protein A-agarose beads. To the supernatant, 10 μl of anti-Src antibody or 3 μl of GCC polyclonal antibody was added, and immunoprecipitation was carried out for 15 h at 4 °C. At the end of 15 h, 10 μl of protein A-agarose beads were again added, and incubation was continued for a further 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed five times with immunoprecipitation buffer. The variance of immunoprecipitation, sample loading, and/or immunoblotting in these experiments in the aggregate was established at ≤10%. Autophosphorylation Assay—To study the activity of Src tyrosine kinase co-immunoprecipitated with GCC, the immunoprecipitations were done at 4 °C from the T84 cell membrane extracts, which were prepared at 4 °C from control, 15 min, and 18 h ST (3 × 10–7m)-treated cells as described earlier. The immunoprecipitates were washed finally with the kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with 25 μlof2× kinase buffer, 10 μl of distilled water, and 10 μl of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP + cold ATP mixture in a final volume of 50 μl on ice for 15 min or 5 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer followed by boiling. The samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose membrane and autoradiography. The above blots were also analyzed by immunoblotting with Src antibody and/or GCC:C8 monoclonal antibody. Phosphorylation of GCC Immunoprecipitate with Protein Kinase A— The immunoprecipitations were done at 4 °C from the T84 cell membrane extracts, which were prepared at 4 °C from control, and 18 h ST (3 × 10–7m)-treated cells. The immunoprecipitates were washed finally with the kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with protein kinase A in a final volume of 20 μl (2 μl of 10× kinase buffer, 8 μl of distilled water, 5 μl of 10 μm [γ-32P]ATP + cold ATP mixture and 5 units of PKA) for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membrane, which was exposed to x-ray film for autoradiography. Interaction of Catalytic Domain Fusion Protein (GST-GCD) of GCC with Src Tyrosine Kinase—T84 cell membranes were prepared as described earlier. The membrane proteins were extracted at 4 °C in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 and a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). Similar amounts of GST-GCD protein (5 μg) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose were incubated with T84 cell membrane extracts at 4 °C for 2 h in the absence or the presence of GST, GST-Src-SH3 followed by autophosphorylation of the bound proteins in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described earlier. To immunoprecipitate Src tyrosine kinase, a similar aliquot of T84 cell membrane extract was treated with Src tyrosine kinase antibody. The samples obtained were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane, autoradiography, and immunoblotting with an antibody specific to Src tyrosine kinase. In Vitro Guanylyl Cyclase Assay—In vitro guanylyl cyclase assays were performed with T84 membrane proteins preincubated with GST or GST-SH3 and in the presence or absence of ST (1 × 10–7m). The assay buffer was 60 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, with 4 mm MgCl2,1mm GTP, 500 μm IBMX, and a GTP-regenerating system consisting of 20 μg creatine phosphokinase and 7.5 mm creatine phosphate. Incubations were continued for 10 min at 37 °C, and the reaction terminated by addition of 400 μlof50mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.0. Samples were boiled for 5 min, and the supernatant taken to assay cGMP by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Measurement of cGMP by RIA—cGMP levels in a given sample were determined by radioimmunoassay as described earlier (32Visweswariah S.S. Santhi G. Balganesh T.S. Microb. Pathog. 1992; 12: 209-218Google Scholar, 34Brooker G. Harper J.F. Terasaki W.L. Moylan R.D. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1979; 10: 1-33Google Scholar). Briefly, the dilution of cGMP antiserum required for RIA was determined with ∼12,000 cpm 125I-labeled cGMP added per tube in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer pH 4.75 containing 5 mg/ml BSA. cGMP antiserum at a dilution of 1:5000–1:10,000 was incubated with known and unknown concentrations of cGMP for 12–16 h at 4 °C in a total volume of 300 μl. Standard cGMP concentration were taken over a range of 3 fmol to 5 pmol/tube. Antibody bound to cGMP was separated from free cGMP by the addition of 0.2% activated charcoal in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.3 containing 1 mg/ml BSA. Tubes were centrifuged, and the charcoal-bound radioactivity monitored in a γ counter. Data were analyzed by Graph Pad Prism. A standard curve of specific binding versus cGMP concentration was plotted from which the unknown cGMP concentration was determined. Data Analysis—Data shown were analyzed on Prism (GraphPad) and expressed as a mean ± S.E., and the Student's t test was used to test statistical significance. Presence of Proline-rich Sequences in GCC—To understand the molecular mechanisms that are involved downstream of the activated GCC receptor, the protein sequence of GCC was analyzed for the presence of any known motif involved in protein-protein interactions. Interestingly, five proline-rich sequences were identified in the intracellular domain of GCC some of which appeared to be similar to the consensus sequences for the binding of the SH3 domain of the Src family of kinases like Src and Hck (Fig. 1). Interaction of GST-Hck-SH3 and GST-Src-SH3 Fusion Proteins with GCC from T84 Colonic Carcinoma Cell Line—To establish the above observation, the interaction of native GCC extracted from the solubilized membrane fraction of T84 cells was checked with GST-SH3 fusion proteins of the Src and Hck tyrosine kinases (Fig. 2). The solubilized receptor was treated with GST as a control or Src and Hck GST-SH3 domains (Fig. 2A) bound to glutathione-Sepharose for 2 h at 25 °C on a shaker. Similar aliquots of the solubilized receptor preparation were used for immunoprecipitation with GCC-specific polyclonal antibody. Bound proteins and the immunoprecipitate were analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody (GCC:C8) to GCC. GCC associated with GST-Src-SH3 and GST-Hck-SH3 fusion proteins in solution but not with GST alone (Fig. 2B). It was interesting to find that the Src SH3 domain bound 2-fold more receptor than the Hck SH3 domain and only one (140 kDa) out of the two differentially post-translationally modified forms of GCC from T84 cells interacted with Src and Hck SH3 domains. This observation indicated a difference in the affinity of Src and Hck SH3 domains for GCC receptor as well as showed the specificity of interaction; therefore further studies on SH3 domain-mediated interactions with GCC were performed with the Src SH3 domain. Physiological Significance of Protein-Protein Interaction Mediated by SH3 Domain—To check the physiological significance of the interaction between GCC and SH3 domain, the solubilized GCC receptor preparations from T84 cells after treatment with ST (3 × 10–7m) in vivo for 15 min and 18 h were incubated with GST and GST-Src-SH3 immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose. The proteins that co-precipitated with GST-Src-SH3 were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and detection was done by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody to GCC (GCC:C8). Interestingly, there was an increase in the affinity of GCC for Src SH3 domain when the receptor was desensitized after prolonged incubation with ST (3 × 10–7m) for 18 h than the control and activated receptor (treatment with ST for 15 min). The equivalent amount of GST-Src-SH3 bound at least 3-fold more receptor from cells treated with ST for 18 h than from control and cells stimulated for 15 min with ST in vivo (Fig. 3). Inhibition of cGMP Production in the Presence of GST-Src-SH3 Fusion Protein in an in Vitro Guanylyl Cyclase Assay—To further examine the importance of such an interaction, it was intriguing to check the effect of the presence of the Src SH3 domain on the production of cGMP in an in vitro guanylyl cyclase assay. T84 cell membrane proteins were preincubated with GST and GST-Src-SH3 followed by incubation with ST (1 × 10–7m). The samples obtained after the assay were subjected to radioimmunoassay to check the levels of cGMP produced. As shown in Fig. 4, the basal levels of production of cGMP did not change significantly in the presence of GST and GST-Src-SH3. However, there was a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in ST-stimulated production of cGMP in the presence of GST-Src-SH3 indicating that binding of the Src SH3 domain to the proline-rich sites in the catalytic domain of GCC could modulate the ligand-stimulated production of cGMP. Differential Profiling of Proteins Interacting with GCC in T84 Cells—To investigate the cellular proteins that might be interacting with GCC under different physiological conditions, the proteins which co-immunoprecipitated with native GCC from T84 cells were studied by different approaches. In one of the approaches, GCC was immunoprecipitated with a specific antibody, and the immunoprecipitate was subj"
