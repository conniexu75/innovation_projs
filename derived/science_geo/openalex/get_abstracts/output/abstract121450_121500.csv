https://openalex.org/W2037509330,"Rapid access to genetic information is central to the revolution taking place in molecular genetics. The simultaneous analysis of the entire human mitochondrial genome is described here. DNA arrays containing up to 135,000 probes complementary to the 16.6-kilobase human mitochondrial genome were generated by light-directed chemical synthesis. A two-color labeling scheme was developed that allows simultaneous comparison of a polymorphic target to a reference DNA or RNA. Complete hybridization patterns were revealed in a matter of minutes. Sequence polymorphisms were detected with single-base resolution and unprecedented efficiency. The methods described are generic and can be used to address a variety of questions in molecular genetics including gene expression, genetic linkage, and genetic variability."

https://openalex.org/W2024732305,"The guidance of developing axons in the nervous system is mediated partly by diffusible chemoattractants secreted by axonal target cells. Netrins are chemoattractants for commissural axons in the vertebrate spinal cord, but the mechanisms through which they produce their effects are unknown. We show that Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC), a transmembrane protein of the immunoglobulin superfamily, is expressed on spinal commissural axons and possesses netrin-1-binding activity. Moreover, an antibody to DCC selectively blocks the netrin-1-dependent outgrowth of commissural axons in vitro. These results indicate that DCC is a receptor or a component of a receptor that mediates the effects of netrin-1 on commissural axons, and they complement genetic evidence for interactions between DCC and netrin homologs in C. elegans and Drosophila."

https://openalex.org/W2098867949,"Several bHLH proteins are involved in vertebrate neurogenesis, but those controlling early stages of neuronal determination have not yet been identified. Here we describe a novel, NeuroD-related bHLH protein, NEUROGENIN, whose expression precedes that of NeuroD in both mouse and Xenopus. Expression of Xenopus NEUROGENIN-related-1 (X-NGNR-1) defines the three prospective territories of primary neurogenesis. Overexpression of X-NGNR-1 (or NEUROGENIN) induces ectopic neurogenesis and ectopic expression of XNeuroD mRNA. Endogenous X-ngnr-1 expression becomes restricted to subsets of cells by lateral inhibition, mediated by X-Delta-1 and X-Notch. The properties of X-NGNR-1 are thus analogous to those of the Drosophila proneural genes, suggesting that it functions as a vertebrate neuronal determination factor."

https://openalex.org/W2069681995,"Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) assembles nucleosomes in a replication-dependent manner. The small subunit of CAF-1 (p48) is a member of a highly conserved subfamily of WD-repeat proteins. There are at least two members of this subfamily in both human (p46 and p48) and yeast cells (Hat2p, a subunit of the B-type H4 acetyltransferase, and Msi1p). Human p48 can bind to histone H4 in the absence of CAF-1 p150 and p60. p48, also a known subunit of a histone deacetylase, copurifies with a chromatin assembly complex (CAC), which contains the three subunits of CAF-1 (p150, p60, p48) and H3 and H4, and promotes DNA replication-dependent chromatin assembly. CAC histone H4 exhibits a novel pattern of lysine acetylation that overlaps with, but is distinct from, that reported for newly synthesized H4 isolated from nascent chromatin. Our data suggest that CAC is a key intermediate of the de novo nucleosome assembly pathway and that the p48 subunit participates in other aspects of histone metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1988134858,"id system was used to screen yeast and human expression libraries for proteins that interact with mismatch repair proteins. PCNA was recovered from both libraries and shown in the case of yeast to interact with both MLH1 and MSH2. A yeast strain containing a mutation in the PCNA gene had a strongly elevated mutation rate in a dinucleotide repeat, and the rate was not further elevated in a strain also containing a mutation in MLH1. Mismatch repair activity was examined in human cell extracts using an assay that does not require DNA repair synthesis. Activity was inhibited by p21 WAF1 or a p21 peptide, both of which bind to PCNA, and activity was restored to inhibited reactions by addition of PCNA. The data suggest a PCNA requirement in mismatch repair at a step preceding DNA resynthesis. The ability of PCNA to bind to MLH1 and MSH2 may reflect linkage between mismatch repair and replication and may be relevant to the roles of mismatch repair proteins in other DNA transactions."

https://openalex.org/W2090865074,"UNC-6 netrin, a laminin-related protein secreted from neuroglia and neurons along the ventral midline, orients migrating cells and pioneering growth cones on the nematode epidermis. UNC-5, a cell surface protein expressed on motile cells and pioneer axons, orients movements away from UNC-6 sources. UNC-40, a homolog of the cell surface proteins DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer) and neogenin, is also expressed on motile cells and pioneer neurons. UNC-40 acts cell autonomously to orient movement toward UNC-6 sources. For cells coexpressing UNC-5, it helps orient movement away from UNC-6 sources. Finally, UNC-40 helps determine the dorsoventral position of cells undergoing purely longitudinal migrations. Together with the recent report that DCC is a netrin receptor in vertebrates, our results suggest that UNC-40 is a component of UNC-6 receptors on motile cells."

https://openalex.org/W2131102224,"We have identified a Drosophila member of the deleted in colorectal cancer (DCC) gene family. The frazzled gene encodes transmembrane proteins that contain four immunoglobulin C2 type domains, six fibronectin type III repeats, and a cytoplasmic domain of 278 amino acids. Like vertebrate members of the DCC family, Frazzled is expressed on axons in the embryonic central nervous system and on motor axons in the periphery. Frazzled is also expressed on epidermis and gut epithelium. Null mutants in frazzled are defective in axon guidance in the central nervous system and in motor axon guidance and targeting in the periphery. The phenotypes strongly resemble those of a deletion of the two Drosophila Netrin genes. We have rescued the frazzled CNS and motor axon defects by expressing Frazzled specifically in neurons; expression in target tissues does not rescue the phenotype. These data, together with vertebrate studies showing binding of DCC to netrin, suggest that Frazzled may function in vivo as a receptor or component of a receptor mediating Netrin-dependent axon guidance."
https://openalex.org/W2007884336,"We have isolated the predominant cytoplasmic histone acetyltransferase activity from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This enzyme acetylates the lysine at residue 12 of free histone H4 but does not modify histone H4 when packaged in chromatin. The activity contains two proteins, Hat1p and Hat2p. Hat1p is the catalytic subunit of the histone acetyltransferase and has an intrinsic substrate specificity that modifies lysine in the recognition sequence GXGXG. The specificity of the enzyme in the yeast cytoplasm is restricted relative to recombinant Hat1p suggesting that it is negatively regulated in vivo. Hat2p, which is required for high affinity binding of the acetyltransferase to histone H4, is highly related to Rbap48, which is a subunit of the chromatin assembly factor, CAF-1, and copurifies with the human histone deacetylase HD1. We propose that the Hat2p/Rbap48 family serve as escorts of histone metabolism enzymes to facilitate their interaction with histone H4."

https://openalex.org/W2014492558,"Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) regulate transmitter release at mammalian central synapses. However, because of the difficulty of recording from mammalian presynaptic terminals, the mechanism underlying mGluR-mediated presynaptic inhibition is not known. Here, simultaneous recordings from a giant presynaptic terminal, the calyx of Held, and its postsynaptic target in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body were obtained in rat brainstem slices. Agonists of mGluRs suppressed a high voltage-activated P/Q-type calcium conductance in the presynaptic terminal, thereby inhibiting transmitter release at this glutamatergic synapse. Because several forms of presynaptic modulation and plasticity are mediated by mGluRs, this identification of a target ion channel is a first step toward elucidation of their molecular mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2018782003,"We have cloned a Xenopus Cdc6 homolog (Xcdc6) and characterized its role in DNA replication with Xenopus egg extracts. Immunodepletion of Xcdc6 abolishes chromosomal replication but not elongation on single-stranded DNA templates. Xcdc6 binds to chromatin at the beginning of interphase but disappears from chromatin upon initiation of replication. Immunodepletion studies indicate that binding of Xcdc6 to chromatin requires Xorc2, a component of the origin recognition complex. Moreover, Xmcm3 cannot bind to chromatin lacking Xcdc6, suggesting that Xorc2, Xcdc6, and Xmcm3 associate with the DNA sequentially. In postreplicative nuclei, Xcdc6 is associated with the nuclear envelope. These studies indicate that Xcdc6, is essential for initiation of replication in vertebrates and that interaction with the nuclear envelope may regulate its function."
https://openalex.org/W1972056955,"Accessory cell-surface molecules involved in the entry of human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 into cells have recently been identified and shown to belong to the family of chemokine receptors. Treatment of human cell lines with soluble monomeric gp120 at 37 degrees C induced an association between the surface CD4-gp120 complex and a 45-kilodalton protein, which can be down-modulated by the phorbol ester phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. The three proteins were coprecipitated from the cell membranes with antibodies to CD4 or to gp120. The 45-kilodalton protein comigrated with fusin on sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and reacted with rabbit antisera to fusin in protein immunoblots. No 45-kilodalton protein could be coprecipitated from similarly treated nonhuman cells. However, infection of 3T3.CD4.401 cells with vaccinia-fusin recombinant virus (vCBYF1), followed by gp120 treatment, resulted in coprecipitation of fusin and CD4.401 molecules from their membranes. Together these data provide evidence for physical association between fusin and the CD4-gp120 complex on cell membranes."

https://openalex.org/W1993219476,"Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DM is a critical participant in antigen presentation that catalyzes the release of class II-associated invariant chain-derived peptides (CLIP) from newly synthesized class II histocompatibility molecules, freeing the peptide-binding site for acquisition of antigenic peptides. The mechanism for the selective release of CLIP but not other peptides is unknown. DM was found to enhance the rate of peptide dissociation to an extent directly proportional to the intrinsic rate of peptide dissociation from HLA-DR, regardless of peptide sequence. Thus, CLIP is rapidly released in the presence of DM, because its intrinsic rate of dissociation is relatively high. In antigen presentation, DM has the potential to markedly enhance the rate of peptide exchange, favoring the presentation of peptides with slower intrinsic rates of dissociation."
https://openalex.org/W2151390187,"Locus control regions (LCRs) are responsible for initiating and maintaining a stable tissue-specific open chromatin structure of a locus. In transgenic mice, LCRs confer high level expression on linked genes independent of position in the mouse genome. Here we show that an incomplete LCR loses this property when integrated into heterochromatic regions. Two disruption mechanisms were observed. One is classical position-effect variegation, resulting in continuous transcription in a clonal subpopulation of cells. The other is a novel mechanism resulting in intermittent gene transcription in all cells. We conclude that only a complete LCR fully overcomes heterochromatin silencing and that it controls the level of transcription by ensuring activity in all cells at all times rather than directly controlling the rate of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1997160430,"A cytosolic yeast karyopherin, Kap104p, was isolated and shown to function in the nuclear import of a specific class of proteins. The protein bound directly to repeat-containing nucleoporins and to a cytosolic pool of two nuclear messenger RNA (mRNA) binding proteins, Nab2p and Nab4p. Depletion of Kap104p resulted in a rapid shift of Nab2p from the nucleus to the cytoplasm without affecting the localization of other nuclear proteins tested. This finding suggests that the major function of Kap104p lies in returning mRNA binding proteins to the nucleus after mRNA export."
https://openalex.org/W2038416582,"In a study of the perceptions of 332 members of genetic support groups with one or more of 101 different genetic disorders in the family, it was found that as a result of a genetic disorder 25 percent of the respondents or affected family members believed they were refused life insurance, 22 percent believed they were refused health insurance, and 13 percent believed they were denied or let go from a job. Fear of genetic discrimination resulted in 9 percent of respondents or family members refusing to be tested for genetic conditions, 18 percent not revealing genetic information to insurers, and 17 percent not revealing information to employers. The level of perceived discrimination points to the need for more information to determine the extent and scope of the problem."
https://openalex.org/W2060399663,"Tim23, an essential component of the protein import machinery of the inner membrane of mitochondria (TIM complex), forms dimers that display a dynamic behavior. Dimer formation is promoted by the membrane potential delta psi. Binding of a matrix targeting sequence to Tim23 triggers dimer dissociation. Monomeric Tim23 is present when a preprotein chain is in transit across the TIM complex. Dimerization of Tim23 is dependent on the second half of its N-terminal hydrophilic domain, which is exposed to the intermembrane space. This segment contains a heptad leucine repeat motif with a predicted capacity for dimer formation. We propose that Tim23 exerts a key function in protein import: Tim23 dimers formed in response to delta psi act as receptors for matrix targeting sequences on the surface of the inner membrane. The ensuring dissociation of Tim23 dimer triggers opening of the TIM channel and insertion of the preprotein."

https://openalex.org/W2116844374,"The 2.6 Å crystal structure of a fragment of the σ70 promoter specificity subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase is described. Residues involved in core RNA polymerase binding lie on one face of the structure. On the opposite face, aligned along one helix, are exposed residues that interact with the −10 consensus promoter element (the Pribnow box), including four aromatic residues involved in promoter melting. The structure suggests one way in which DNA interactions may be inhibited in the absence of RNA polymerase and provides a framework for the interpretation of a large number of genetic and biochemical analyses."

https://openalex.org/W2030626178,"Importin-alpha mediates nuclear protein import by binding nuclear localization signals and importin-beta. We find approximately 30% of SRP1p, the yeast importin-alpha, in a nuclear complex with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear cap-binding protein complex (CBC). Similarly, a large fraction of Xenopus CBC is associated with importin-alpha in the nucleus. CBC promotes nuclear export of capped U snRNAs and shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm. The CBC-importin-alpha complex binds specifically to capped RNA, suggesting that CBC might shuttle while bound to importin-alpha. Strikingly, importin-beta binding displaces the RNA from the CBC-importin-alpha complex. Thus, the commitment of CBC for nuclear reentry triggers the release of the export substrate into the cytoplasm. We provide evidence for a mechanism that ensures that importin-mediated RNA release is a specifically cytoplasmic event."
https://openalex.org/W2005374586,Histone-DNA contacts within a nucleosome influence the function of trans-acting factors and the molecular machines required to activate the transcription process. The internal architecture of a positioned nucleosome has now been probed with the use of photoactivatable cross-linking reagents to determine the placement of histones along the DNA molecule. A model for the nucleosome is proposed in which the winged-helix domain of the linker histone is asymmetrically located inside the gyres of DNA that also wrap around the core histones. This domain extends the path of the protein superhelix to one side of the core particle.
https://openalex.org/W2084121212,"We previously characterized Drosophila and human TAF subunits that make up the core TFIID complex found in all cells. Here, we report that differentiated B cells contain a novel substoichiometric TAF of 105 kDa not found associated with TFIID isolated from other cell types. The cDNA encoding hTAFII105 reveals a highly conserved C-terminal domain shared by hTAFII130 and dTAFII110, while the N-terminal coactivator domain has diverged significantly. All cells tested express TAFII105 mRNA, but only B cells contain significant levels of protein associated with TFIID. Transient overexpression of hTAFII105 selectively squelches the transcription of some genes in B cells. These properties suggest that TAFII105 is a cell type–specific subunit of TFIID that may be responsible for mediating transcription by a subset of activators in B cells."
https://openalex.org/W2024334429,"During Tetrahymena conjugation, programmed DNA degradation occurs in two separate nuclei. Thousands of germline-specific deletion elements are removed from the genome of the developing somatic macronucleus, and the old parental macronucleus is degraded by an apoptotic mechanism. An abundant polypeptide, Pdd1p (formerly p65), localizes to both of these nuclei at the time of DNA degradation. Here we report that, in developing macronuclei, Pdd1p localizes to electron-dense, heterochromatic structures that contain germline-specific deletion elements. Pdd1p also associates with parental macronuclei during terminal stages of apoptosis. Sequencing of the PDD1 gene reveals it to be a member of the chromodomain family, suggesting a molecular link between heterochromatin assembly and programmed DNA degradation."

A complementary DNA for the cellular activity, Tat-SF1, has been isolated. This factor is required for Tat trans-activation and is a substrate of an associated cellular kinase. Cotransfection with the complementary DNA for Tat-SF1 specifically modulates Tat activation. Tat-SF1 contains two RNA recognition motifs and a highly acidic carboxyl-terminal half. It is distantly related to EWS and FUS/TLS, members of a family of putative transcription factors with RNA recognition motifs that are associated with sarcomas."

https://openalex.org/W2101438339,"A broadly applicable genetic strategy was developed for investigating RNA–protein interactions and applied to the HIV-1 Rev protein. By rapidly screening thousands of Rev–RNA interactions in Escherichia coli, we isolated Rev suppressor mutations that alleviated the deleterious effect of mutations in RRE stem–loop IIB, the high affinity RNA-binding site for Rev. All of these suppressor mutations map to a single arginine-deficient face of a Rev α-helix, and some alter the binding specificity of the protein, providing genetic evidence for direct contacts between specific Rev amino acids and RNA nucleotides in the RNA complex of Rev. The spatial constraints suggested by these data have enabled us to model the structure of this complex."

The vibrational bands that lie in the far IR are unique for each PAH molecule and allow discrimination among the three PAH molecules. The far-IR PAH spectra, therefore, may prove useful in the assignment of unidentified spectral features from astronomical objects."
https://openalex.org/W1966633139,"Caulobacter crescentus undergoes asymmetric cell division, resulting in a stalked cell and a motile swarmer cell. The genes encoding external components of the flagellum are expressed in the swarmer compartment of the predivisional cell through the localized activation of the transcription factor FlbD. The mechanisms responsible for the temporal and spatial activation of FlbD were determined through identification of FlbE, a histidine kinase required for FlbD activity. FlbE is asymmetrically distributed in the predivisional cell. It is located at the pole of the stalked compartment and at the site of cell division in the swarmer compartment. These findings suggest that FlbE and FlbD are activated in response to a morphological change in the cell resulting from cell division events."
