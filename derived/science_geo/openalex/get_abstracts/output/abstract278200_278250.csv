https://openalex.org/W2045925085,"Most of our familiar statistical methods, such as hypothesis testing, linear regression, analysis of variance, and maximum likelihood estimation, were designed to be implemented on mechanical calculators. Modern electronic computation has encouraged a host of new statistical methods that require fewer distributional assumptions than their predecessors and can be applied to more complicated statistical estimators. These methods allow the scientist to explore and describe data and draw valid statistical inferences without the usual concerns for mathematical tractability. This is possible because traditional methods of mathematical analysis are replaced by specially constructed computer algorithms. Mathematics has not disappeared from statistical theory. It is the main method for deciding which algorithms are correct and efficient tools for automating statistical inference."

The brain is necessary for the synchronization of this behavior with the environmental photoperiod. This function is fully preserved when all the brain's nervous connections are severed or when a ""loose"" brain is transplanted into the tip of the abdomen. By appropriate experiments it was possible to show that the entire mechanism is brain-centered. The components include a photoreceptor mechanism, a clock, and a neuroendocrine output. The clock-controlled release of the hormone acts on the central nervous system to trigger a species-specific behavior pattern which culminates in ecdysis."

The agent apparently multiplied. Leafhopper vectors that were injected with the pure cultures transmitted the agent to healthy corn plants and induced the corn stunt disease."
https://openalex.org/W2015571513,"A computerized (smallest average misfit) best fit position is obtained for the juxtaposition of Africa and Antarctica in a continental drift reconstruction. An S-shaped portion of the Weddell and Princess Martha Coast regions of western East Antarctica is fitted into a similar profile along southeastern Africa. The total amount of overlap is 36,300 square kilometers, and the underlap is 23,600 square kilometers; the total mismatch is thus of 59,900 square kilometers. The congruency along the 1000-fathom isobath is remarkably good and suggests that this reconstruction is valid within the overall framework of the Gondwana supercontinent."

This finding of a new type of interaction between pesticide chemicals suggests the possibility of controlling the persistence of residues on plants by use of certain pesticide-photosensitizer combinations and application sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2075270443,"The sipunculan worm Aspidosiphon brocki reproduces asexually by transverse fision into two unequal parts, the smaller part comprising the posterior fifth of the animal. Prior to fission each part regenerates the structures essential to the formation of a new individual. The smaller posterior part (daughter) regenerates an anterior body, including introvert, anterior gut, retractor muscles, and nephridia, whereas the larger anterior part (parent) regenerates only the posterior body wall."

Several sites have been excavated in Soviet Central Asia, but few have been adequately presented. Recent excavations in north Afghanistan may throw new light on the problem because of the size of the rock shelter involved and its relative geologic dating."

Combining group instruction by means of slides with a self-teaching process designed for the individual promises to be beneficial to students and teachers alike. At this moment, the principal advantage of the method is the fact that a given course can be intensified without having to increase the number of teaching hours allotted by the medical school."
