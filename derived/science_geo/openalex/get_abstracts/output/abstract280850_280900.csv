https://openalex.org/W2028433800,"Author(s): Cairns, EJ; Dunning, JS | Abstract: The state of the art for high-temperature batteries is presented and discussed. Emphasis is given to the lithium alloy/metal sulfide and sodium/sulfur cells. Other systems considered include lithium/chlorine and sodium/metal halide. Cell chemistry and performance and life-limiting factors are reviewed for all of the systems and the status of investigations in critical problem areas is given. Recent advances in the demonstration of high specific energy and expectations for future improvement are presented."

Little or no difference was found in amounts of endogenous gibberellin in the two types of plants, but amount of native gibberellic acid antagonists was higher in runner plants. Furthermore, runner plants contained a particular gibberellic acid inhibitor not found in erect plants. Applications of various auxins, antiauxins, and a cytokinin had no effect on tropistic growth of the side branches."

Further generation of methane or local pressure reduction resuilts in sediment dilation and loss of sediment stability. The grains of sediment separated by gas behave in toto as an elastic fluid, and typical "" slumping structures "" result."

https://openalex.org/W2076142021,"Photographs of the constellation Cygnus taken in the daytime from altitudes above 100 kilometers indicate that the day sky brightness in the wave-length region from 3600 to 7000 angstroms is only slightly brighter than the night sky viewed from the ground. No diffuse cloud of particles was apparent in the vicinity of the rocket payload, but discrete particles must be considered in the design of instruments for rockets and satellites. The resultant data and reports of star sightings from manned spacecraft indicate similar optical environments for both types of vehicles, that is, discrete particles and relatively low levels of background brightness, only slightly brighter than the night sky as an upper limit."
