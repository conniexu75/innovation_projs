https://openalex.org/W2891220313,"Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is a tightly regulated redox signal that transmits information from the organelle to the cell. Other mitochondrial signals, such as ATP, are sensed by enzymes, including the key metabolic sensor and regulator, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK responds to the cellular ATP/AMP and ATP/ADP ratios by matching mitochondrial ATP production to demand. Previous reports proposed that AMPK activity also responds to ROS, by ROS acting on redox-sensitive cysteine residues (Cys-299/Cys-304) on the AMPK α subunit. This suggests an appealing model in which mitochondria fine-tune AMPK activity by both adenine nucleotide–dependent mechanisms and by redox signals. Here we assessed whether physiological levels of ROS directly alter AMPK activity. To this end we added exogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to cells and utilized the mitochondria-targeted redox cycler MitoParaquat to generate ROS within mitochondria without disrupting oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial and cytosolic thiol oxidation was assessed by measuring peroxiredoxin dimerization and by redox-sensitive fluorescent proteins. Replacing the putative redox-active cysteine residues on AMPK α1 with alanines did not alter the response of AMPK to H2O2. In parallel with measurements of AMPK activity, we measured the cell ATP/ADP ratio. This allowed us to separate the effects on AMPK activity due to ROS production from those caused by changes in this ratio. We conclude that AMPK activity in response to redox changes is not due to direct action on AMPK itself, but is a secondary consequence of redox effects on other processes, such as mitochondrial ATP production.

https://openalex.org/W2891258623,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have emerged as important mediators of intercellular communication and as possible therapeutic agents in inflammation-mediated demyelinating diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). In the present study, we investigated whether intravenously administered EVs derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from human adipose tissue might mediate recovery in Theiler’s murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV)-induced demyelinating disease, a progressive model of MS. SJL/J mice were subjected to EV treatment once the disease was established. We found that intravenous EV administration improved motor deficits, reduced brain atrophy, increased cell proliferation in the subventricular zone and decreased inflammatory infiltrates in the spinal cord in mice infected with TMEV. EV treatment was also capable of modulating neuroinflammation, given glial fibrillary acidic protein and Iba-1 staining were reduced in the brain, whereas myelin protein expression was increased. Changes in the morphology of microglial cells in the spinal cord suggest that EVs also modulate the activation state of microglia. The clear reduction in plasma cytokine levels, mainly in the Th1 and Th17 phenotypes, in TMEV mice treated with EVs confirms the immunomodulatory ability of intravenous EVs. According to our results, EV administration attenuates motor deficits through immunomodulatory actions, diminishing brain atrophy and promoting remyelination. Further studies are necessary to establish EV delivery as a possible therapy for the neurodegenerative phase of MS."
https://openalex.org/W2891325698,"Meaningful iteration between place-based knowledge of rivers and generalised, theoretically-framed understandings is a significant challenge in river science and management. How can we communicate knowledge of the inherent complexity of river systems in light of managerial quests for simple, easy-to-apply frameworks that can be used by a wide range of practitioners, such that we can meaningfully transfer experiences in river science and management from one situation to another? Identification, definition, classification and naming are vital parts of this process. In a sense, a name is like a ‘brand’, for which a consistency of product is expected. The River Styles Framework is a flexible, open-ended approach to river science and management. The Framework applies a set of hierarchical principles to differentiate reaches, interpret their process-based behaviour and examine interactions between patterns of reaches at the catchment scale. Here we outline an evolution and tightening of the Framework to better communicate how to identify and name types of river at the reach scale. Like the River Styles Framework itself, the naming convention applies hierarchical procedures, starting at the valley setting scale, and incorporating analyses of river planform, channel and floodplain landforms (geomorphic units) and bed material texture. Using a series of examples from around the world, we show how this naming convention can be applied to name river reaches and can be adapted to particular purposes in a consistent, readily communicable manner. We outline various challenges that are faced in managing the use of such a naming convention."
https://openalex.org/W2891493686,"Rainfall exerts a controlling influence on the availability and quality of vegetation and surface water for herbivores in African terrestrial ecosystems. We analyse temporal trends and variation in rainfall in the Maasai Mara ecosystem of East Africa and infer their implications for animal population and biodiversity dynamics. The data originated from 15 rain gauges in the Mara region (1965–2015) and one station in Narok Town (1913–2015), in Kenya’s Narok County. This is the first comprehensive and most detailed analysis of changes in rainfall in the region of its kind. Our results do not support the current predictions of the International Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) of very likely increases of rainfall over parts of Eastern Africa. The dry season rainfall component increased during 1935–2015 but annual rainfall decreased during 1962–2015 in Narok Town. Monthly rainfall was more stable and higher in the Mara than in Narok Town, likely because the Mara lies closer to the high-precipitation areas along the shores of Lake Victoria. Predominantly deterministic and persistent inter-annual cycles and extremely stable seasonal rainfall oscillations characterize rainfall in the Mara and Narok regions. The frequency of severe droughts increased and floods intensified in the Mara but droughts became less frequent and less severe in Narok Town. The timings of extreme droughts and floods coincided with significant periodicity in rainfall oscillations, implicating strong influences of global atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns on regional rainfall variability. These changing rainfall patterns have implications for animal population dynamics. The increase in dry season rainfall during 1935–2015 possibly counterbalanced the impacts of resource scarcity generated by the declining annual rainfall during 1965–2015 in Narok Town. However, the increasing rainfall extremes in the Mara can be expected to create conditions conducive to outbreaks of infectious animal diseases and reduced vegetation quality for herbivores, particularly when droughts and floods persist over multiple years. The more extreme wet season rainfall may also alter herbivore space use, including migration patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2890578209,"Within the scope of the 3Rs of Russel and Burch, the number of laboratory animals can be reduced by repeated use of an animal. This strategy only becomes relevant, if the total amount of pain, distress or harm the individual animal experiences does not exceed the severity of a single manipulation. For example, when using imaging techniques, an animal can be examined several times during a study, but it has to be anesthetized each time imaging is performed. The severity of anesthesia is thought to be mild according to the Directive 2010/63/EU. However, the Directive does not differentiate between single and repeated anesthesia, although repeated anesthesia may have a greater impact on well-being. Hence, we compared the impact of single and repeated anesthesia (six times at an interval of three to four days) by injection of ketamine and xylazine (KX) on the well-being of adult female and male C57BL/6JRj mice. After anesthesia, well-being of mice was assessed according to a protocol for systematic assessment of well-being including nesting, the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS), a test for trait anxiety, home cage activity, and the rotarod test for motor activity, food intake, and body weight, as well as corticosterone (metabolite) analysis. Repeated anesthesia increased the MGS in mice of both sexes and caused short-term effects on well-being of female mice in the immediate post-anesthetic period, indicated by longer lasting effects on trait anxiety-related behavior. However, corticosterone metabolite concentrations suggested that mice habituated to the stress induced by repeated KX administration. Hence, the mildly negative effects on well-being of repeated KX anesthesia do not seem to accumulate over time using the respective regimen. However, further observations for severity classification are warranted in order to more specifically determine the duration of mild distress and trait anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2890673643,"Background The European & Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP), like many other research funders, requires its grantees to make papers available via open access (OA). This article investigates the effect of publishing in OA journals and international collaboration within and between European and sub-Saharan African countries on citation impact and likelihood of falling into the top 1% and top 10% most cited papers in poverty-related disease (PRD) research. Methods Disease-specific research publications were identified in the Web of Science™ and MEDLINE using Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms. Data on the open accessibility of scientific literature were derived from 1science oaFindr. Publication data, including relative citation counts, were extracted for 2003–2015. Regression models were applied to quantify the relationship between relative citations and presence in the 1% and top 10% most cited papers versus OA and international collaboration. Results The results show that since 2003 papers on PRDs have become increasingly available in OA. Among all PRD areas, malaria research is most frequently published in OA and in international collaboration. The adjusted regression analyses show that holding other factors constant, publishing research in OA and in international collaboration has a significant and meaningful citation advantage over non-OA or non-international collaborative research. Publishing papers as part of a European-wide or European- sub-Saharan African collaboration increases research impact. In contrast, such collaboration advantage is not observed for research output involving sub-Saharan Africa only which seems to decrease research impact. Conclusions Our results indicate that there is a real, measurable citation advantage for publishing PRD research in OA and international collaboration. However, the international collaboration advantage seems to be region-specific with increased research impact for European-wide and European-sub-Saharan African collaborations but a decrease in research impact of collaborations confined to sub-Saharan African research institutions. Further research is required to further verify this finding and to understand the underlying factors related to this observed decrease in research impact. To target future research capacity building activities in sub-Saharan Africa it is important to assess whether the observed decreased impact reflects the scientific competencies and geographic distribution of individual researchers or institutional-, national- or funder-specific research requirements."
https://openalex.org/W2890131570,"Objective Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and periodontitis are chronic inflammatory diseases that share common risk factors. However, the bidirectional relationship between RA and periodontal disease is not fully understood. This study was undertaken to describe the bacterial component of the subgingival microbiome in RA patients and to relate this to RA disease activity and periodontal status. Methods Patients with chronic established RA (N = 78) were periodontally examined and their subgingival plaque samples were collected; their clinical and laboratory data on RA status and medication were obtained from medical records. Bacterial DNA was quantified by universal 16S rDNA qPCR, and Porphyromonas gingivalis by species-specific qPCR. For microbiome assessment, 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was performed. Results Active RA was diagnosed in 58% of the patients and periodontitis in 82% (mild: 9%, moderate: 55%, severe: 18%). P. gingivalis was present in 14% of the samples. Different levels of gingival bleeding, periodontal probing depth, RA disease status, prednisolone use and smoking were associated with significantly different microbiome compositions. Two subgingival microbial community types were discerned. Conclusion In RA patients with active disease, anti-inflammatory medication as part of RA therapy was associated with better oral health status and a healthier subgingival microbiome compared to that of RA patients in remission, especially those in remission who were current smokers. RA patients in remission with current smoking status may particularly benefit from a systematic periodontal treatment program. The potential role of microbial community types in patient stratification and personalized therapy should be assessed in longitudinal studies."
https://openalex.org/W2952472437,"The human skeleton undergoes constant remodeling throughout the lifetime. Processes occurring on microscopic and molecular scales degrade bone and replace it with new, fully functional tissue. Multiple bone remodeling events occur simultaneously, continuously and independently throughout the body, so that the entire skeleton is completely renewed about every ten years.Bone remodeling is performed by groups of cells called Bone Multicellular Units (BMU). BMUs consist of different cell types, some specialized in the resorption of old bone, others encharged with producing new bone to replace the former. These processes are tightly regulated so that the amount of new bone produced is in perfect equilibrium with that of old bone removed, thus maintaining bone microscopic structure.To date, many regulatory molecules involved in bone remodeling have been identified, but the precise mechanism of BMU operation remains to be fully elucidated. Given the complexity of the signaling pathways already known, one may question whether such complexity is an inherent requirement of the process or whether some subset of the multiple constituents could fulfill the essential role, leaving functional redundancy to serve an alternative safety role. We propose in this work a minimal model of BMU function that involves a limited number of signals able to account for fully functional BMU operation. Our main assumptions were i) at any given time, any cell within a BMU can select only one among a limited choice of decisions, i.e. divide, die, migrate or differentiate, ii) this decision is irreversibly determined by depletion of an appropriate internal inhibitor and iii) the dynamics of any such inhibitor are coupled to that of specific external mediators, such as hormones, cytokines, growth factors. It was thus shown that efficient BMU operation manifests as an emergent process, which results from the individual and collective decisions taken by cells within the BMU unit in the absence of any external planning."
https://openalex.org/W2891668604,"Background and purpose A multi-country European study using data from six healthcare databases from four countries was performed to evaluate in a large study population (>32 million) the risk of ischemic stroke (IS) associated with individual NSAIDs and to assess the impact of risk factors of IS and co-medication. Methods Case-control study nested in a cohort of new NSAID users. For each case, up to 100 sex- and age-matched controls were selected and confounder-adjusted odds ratios for current use of individual NSAIDs compared to past use calculated. Results 49,170 cases of IS were observed among 4,593,778 new NSAID users. Use of coxibs (odds ratio 1.08, 95%-confidence interval 1.02–1.15) and use of traditional NSAIDs (1.16, 1.12–1.19) were associated with an increased risk of IS. Among 32 individual NSAIDs evaluated, the highest significant risk of IS was observed for ketorolac (1.46, 1.19–1.78), but significantly increased risks (in decreasing order) were also found for diclofenac, indomethacin, rofecoxib, ibuprofen, nimesulide, diclofenac with misoprostol, and piroxicam. IS risk associated with NSAID use was generally higher in persons of younger age, males, and those with a prior history of IS. Conclusions Risk of IS differs between individual NSAIDs and appears to be higher in patients with a prior history of IS or transient ischemic attack (TIA), in younger or male patients. Co-medication with aspirin, other antiplatelets or anticoagulants might mitigate this risk. The small to moderate observed risk increase (by 13–46%) associated with NSAIDs use represents a public health concern due to widespread NSAID usage."
https://openalex.org/W2889995635,"Background Mobile application based delivery of psycho-social interventions may help reduce the treatment gap for severe mental illnesses (SMIs) and decrease the burden on caregivers. Apps developed in high income settings show effectiveness, but they suffer from lack of applicability in low resource scenarios due to the difference in technology penetration, affordability, and acceptance. Objective This study aimed to understand health technology usage, perceived needs, and acceptability of app based interventions in patients with SMIs to improve illness management and reduce caregiver burden. Methods The study was conducted in inpatient and outpatient settings of a tertiary care center in North India. A cross-sectional survey assessed smartphone and health app usage. Further, three focus group discussions evaluated the needs and apprehensions in using apps in management of SMIs. Results A total of 176 participants including 88 patients and 88 caregivers completed the survey. Smartphone ownership was similar to the national average (30%) in both caregivers (38.6%) and in patients (31.8%). Although subjects regularly used a third party app, health app usage was very low. Cost, unfamiliarity, and language were significant barriers to adoption. The focus group discussions provided insight into the various apprehensions of caregivers in using and in allowing patients to use smartphones and such apps. Caregivers wanted mobile apps for accessing information regarding services and resources available for people with SMI, and they felt such apps can be helpful if they could automate some of their routine caregiving activities. However, the significant difficulty was perceived in regards to the cost of the device, language of the medium, and unfamiliarity in using technology. Apprehensions that SMI patients might misuse technology, or damage the device were also prevalent. Conclusions The study systematically looks into the scope, design considerations and limitations of implementing a mobile technology based intervention for low resource settings. With only one-third of the patients and caregivers having access to smartphones and internet, parallel outreach strategies like IVRS should be actively considered while designing interventions. The difficulty of understanding and searching in a non-native language needs to be addressed. Hand holding of caregivers and frequent encouragement from treating doctors might significantly help in technology adoption and in surmounting the apprehensions related to using technology. To make the solution acceptable and useful to the already over-burdened caregivers, developers need to work closely with patients’ family members and follow a ground-up collaborative approach to app development. The scope of delivering mental health services through technology is immense in resource constrained settings like India, provided we, researchers, appreciate and accept the fact that in the varied landscape of a divergent economic, educational, and cultural milieu, a single solution will never suffice for all, and intervention modality matching with end user capacity will be of paramount importance in determining the success of the endeavor."
https://openalex.org/W2891178556,"Advances in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) have enabled high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) to emerge as a sensitive tool for measuring environmental exposures and corresponding biological response. Using measurements collected as part of a large, panel-based study of car commuters, the current analysis examines in-vehicle air pollution concentrations, targeted inflammatory biomarker levels, and metabolomic profiles to trace potential metabolic perturbations associated with on-road traffic exposures.A 60-person panel of adults participated in a crossover study, where each participant conducted a highway commute and randomized to either a side-street commute or clinic exposure session. In addition to in-vehicle exposure characterizations, participants contributed pre- and post-exposure dried blood spots for 2-hr changes in targeted proinflammatory and vascular injury biomarkers and 10-hr changes in the plasma metabolome. Samples were analyzed on a Thermo QExactive MS system in positive and negative electrospray ionization (ESI) mode. Data were processed and analyzed in R using apLCMS, xMSanalyzer, and limma. Features associated with environmental exposures or biological endpoints were identified with a linear mixed effects model and annotated through human metabolic pathway analysis in mummichog.HRM detected 10-hr perturbations in 110 features associated with in-vehicle, particulate metal exposures (Al, Pb, and Fe) which reflect changes in arachidonic acid, leukotriene, and tryptophan metabolism. Two-hour changes in proinflammatory biomarkers hs-CRP, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β were also associated with 10-hr changes in the plasma metabolome, suggesting diverse amino acid, leukotriene, and antioxidant metabolism effects. A putatively identified metabolite, 20-OH-LTB4, decreased after in-vehicle exposure to particulate metals, suggesting a subclinical immune response.Acute exposures to traffic-related air pollutants are associated with broad inflammatory response, including several traditional markers of inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2889670296,"Damage to the locus ceruleus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of neurological conditions. Locus ceruleus neurons accumulate toxic metals such as mercury selectively, however, the presence of toxic metals in locus ceruleus neurons of people of different ages, and with a variety of disorders, is not known. To demonstrate at what age toxic metals are first detectable in the locus ceruleus, and to evaluate whether their presence is more common in certain clinicopathological conditions, we looked for these metals in 228 locus ceruleus samples. Samples were taken at coronial autopsies from individuals with a wide range of ages, pre-existing conditions and causes of death. Paraffin sections of pons containing the locus ceruleus were stained with silver nitrate autometallography, which indicates inorganic mercury, silver and bismuth within cells (termed autometallography-detected toxic metals, or AMG™). No locus ceruleus AMG neurons were seen in 38 individuals aged under 20 years. 47% of the 190 adults (ie, aged 20 years and over) had AMG locus ceruleus neurons. The proportion of adults with locus ceruleus AMG neurons increased during aging, except for a decreased proportion in the 90-plus years age group. No differences were found in the proportions of locus ceruleus AMG neurons between groups with different neurological, psychiatric, or other clinicopathological conditions, or among various causes of death. Elemental analysis with laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry was used to cross-validate the metals detected by AMG, by looking for silver, gold, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, iron, mercury, nickel, and lead in the locus ceruleus of ten individuals. This confirmed the presence of mercury in locus ceruleus samples containing AMG neurons, and showed cadmium, silver, lead, iron, and nickel in the locus ceruleus of some individuals. In conclusion, toxic metals stained by AMG (most likely inorganic mercury) appear in locus ceruleus neurons in early adult life. About half of adults in this study had locus ceruleus neurons containing inorganic mercury, and elemental analysis found a range of other toxic metals in the locus ceruleus. Locus ceruleus inorganic mercury increased during aging, except for a decrease in advanced age, but was not found more often in any single clinicopathological condition or cause of death."
https://openalex.org/W2890566837,"Growing evidence supports that prostate cancer (PCa) is a metabolic syndrome-related cancer, but the evidence is lacking regarding the association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and PCa. We aimed to investigate whether PCa is related with NAFLD in Korean adults.Data from the National Health Insurance Corporation between 2009 and 2012 were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression method. NALFD was defined based on the fatty liver index (FLI) and hepatic steatosis index (HSI). Newly diagnosed PCa was identified using the claims data.NAFLD based on FLI and HSI was identified in 2,002,375 (19%) and 2,629,858 (25%) of 10,516,985 subjects, respectively. Each FLI ≥ 60 and HSI ≥ 36 was independently associated with the development of PCa after adjusting for other confounders (hazard ratio (HR) 1.09, 95% CI: 1.06-1.12 and HR 1.19, 95% CI: 1.16-1.23). The association was more prominent among those who were older (FLI, ≥ 65 years old and HSI, ≥ 40 years old), were not currently smoking, were presently consuming alcohol (< 30g/day) and had null components of metabolic syndrome than each counterpart. Non-obese persons with NAFLD defined by HSI had a higher risk of developing PCa than those with body mass index > 25 Kg/m2.NAFLD defined by FLI or HSI may help identify high-risk individuals for developing PCa particular in the elderly, even in the absence of obesity or metabolic syndrome. Future studies on this topic should necessarily be repeated based on ultrasonographic findings."
https://openalex.org/W2892293885,"Introduction Despite considerable progress, just over half of the 37 million people eligible to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) have accessed treatment and millions of HIV-positive people still do not know their status. With demand for ART continuing to grow, meeting the ambitious 90-90-90 HIV treatment targets will depend on improved access to high-quality diagnostics to both diagnose infection and monitor treatment adherence in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Robust projections of future demand for CD4, viral load (VL), HIV early-infant-diagnosis (EID) tests and HIV rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are needed as scale-up continues. Methods We estimate the current coverage for HIV diagnostics and project future demand to 2021 using a consolidated forecast using data on past coverage and current demand from a number of sources, from 130 predominantly LMIC countries. Results We forecast that the overall number of CD4 tests is expected to decline between now and 2021 as more countries adopt test-and-treat and shift to VL testing for patient monitoring. Our consolidated forecast projects a gradual decline in demand for CD4 tests to 16.6 million by 2021. We anticipate that demand for VL tests will increase to 28.5 million by 2021, reflecting the increasing number of people who will receive ART and the adoption of VL testing for patient monitoring. We expect that the demand for EID tests will grow more rapidly than in past years, driven by the implementation of testing at birth in programmes globally, in line with WHO guideline recommendations, doubling to 2.1 million tests by 2021. Demand for rapid diagnostic tests is also likely to increase, reaching 509 million tests by 2021. Discussion In order to achieve the ambitious 90-90-90 targets, it will be essential to maintain and improve access to CD4, VL, EID tests and RDTs. These projections provide insight into the global demand we can expect to see for these HIV monitoring and diagnostic tests, both in relation to historical trends, and the 90-90-90 targets. Our projections will better enable producers to ensure adequate supply, and to support procurement organisations in planning future funding and purchase plans to meet the anticipated demand. The findings highlight the ongoing need for governments and international funding bodies to prioritise improving capacity and access to HIV diagnostic and monitoring technologies in line with demand."
https://openalex.org/W2891449984,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3) is a dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by a polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat expansion in the ATXN3 gene which encodes the deubiquitinating enzyme, ATXN3. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenic role of mutant, polyQ-expanded ATXN3 in SCA3 including disease protein aggregation, impairment of ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation and transcriptional dysregulation. A better understanding of the normal functions of this protein may shed light on SCA3 disease pathogenesis. To assess the potential normal role of ATXN3 in regulating gene expression, we compared transcriptional profiles in WT versus Atxn3 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Differentially expressed genes in the absence of ATXN3 contribute to multiple signal transduction pathways, suggesting a status switch of signaling pathways including depressed Wnt and BMP4 pathways and elevated growth factor pathways such as Prolactin, TGF-β, and Ephrin pathways. The Eph receptor A3 (Efna3), a receptor protein-tyrosine kinase in the Ephrin pathway that is highly expressed in the nervous system, was the most differentially upregulated gene in Atxn3 null MEFs. This increased expression of Efna3 was recapitulated in Atxn3 knockout mouse brainstem, a selectively vulnerable brain region in SCA3. Overexpression of normal or expanded ATXN3 was sufficient to repress Efna3 expression, supporting a role for ATXN3 in regulating Ephrin signaling. We further show that, in the absence of ATXN3, Efna3 upregulation is associated with hyperacetylation of histones H3 and H4 at the Efna3 promoter, which in turn is induced by decreased levels of HDAC3 and NCoR in ATXN3 null cells. Together, these results reveal a normal role for ATXN3 in transcriptional regulation of multiple signaling pathways of potential relevance to disease processes in SCA3."
https://openalex.org/W2890620140,"Co-occurrence between mesopredators can be achieved by differentiation of prey, temporal activity, and spatial habitat use. The study of mesopredator interactions is a growing area of research in tropical forests and shedding new light on inter-guild competition between threatened vertebrate species that were previously little understood. Here, we investigate sympatry between the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) and Asiatic golden cat (Pardofelis temminckii) living in the Sumatran rainforests of Indonesia. We investigate: i) spatial overlap of predator-prey species using a combination of single-species occupancy modelling and Bayesian two-species modelling, while controlling for the possible influence of several confounding landscape variables; and, ii) temporal overlap between mesopredators and their shared prey through calculating their kernel density estimate associations. From four study areas, representing lowland, hill, sub-montane and montane forest, 28,404 camera trap nights were sampled. Clouded leopard and golden cat were respectively detected in 24.3% and 22.6% of the 292 sampling sites (camera stations) and co-occurred in 29.6% of the sites where they were detected. Golden cat occupancy was highest in the study area where clouded leopard occupancy was lowest and conversely lowest in the study area where clouded leopard occupancy was highest. However, our fine-scale (camera trap site) analyses found no evidence of avoidance between these two felid species. While both mesopredators exhibited highest spatial overlap with the larger-bodied prey species, temporal niche separation was also found. Clouded leopard was more nocturnal and, consequently, had higher temporal overlap with the more nocturnal prey species, such as porcupine and mouse deer, whereas the more diurnal golden cat had higher overlap with the strictly diurnal great argus pheasant. The Bayesian two species occupancy modelling approach applied in our study fills several important knowledge gaps of Sumatra’s lesser known mesopredators and provides a replicable methodology for studying interspecific competition for other small-medium sized carnivore species in the tropics."
https://openalex.org/W2890724769,"What causes us to display selfish behaviors? We explored the extent to which Dark Triad traits (sub-clinical psychopathy, narcissism, and Machiavellianism) support a selfish behavioral strategy. We related performance on a hypothetical Prisoner’s Dilemma (an economic game that simulates a two-person social dilemma) to participants’ (N = 1400) Dark Triad scores. Because contextual factors also impact selfish behaviors, we tested how framing (gain vs. loss; and social vs. nonsocial) shaped performance in the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Participants with high Dark Triad scores were more likely to behave selfishly in the Prisoner’s Dilemma. Participants were also most likely to betray their partner in loss-framed and non-socially framed contexts. These effects did not interact with Dark Triad scores. Our data are consistent with the view that seemingly negative personality traits (like those associated with the Dark Triad traits) that persist in the population may serve as evolutionarily adaptive behavioral strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2891128974,"Tubulin heterodimers are the building blocks of microtubules and disruption of their dynamics is exploited in the treatment of cancer. Electric fields at certain frequencies and magnitudes are believed to do the same. Here, the tubulin dimer's response to external electric fields was determined by atomistic simulation. External fields from 50 to 750 kV/cm, applied for 10 ns, caused significant conformational rearrangements that were dependent upon the field's directionality. Charged and flexible regions, including the α:H1-B2 loop, β:M-loop, and C-termini, were susceptible. Closer inspection of the α:H1-B2 loop in lower strength fields revealed that these effects were consistent and proportional to field strength, and the findings indicate that external electric fields modulate the stability of microtubules through conformational changes to key loops involved in lateral contacts. We also find evidence that tubulin's curvature and elongation are affected, and external electric fields may bias tubulin towards depolymerization."

Comparing the second to the first round, significantly more FSWs (93% vs. 88%, p<0.001) and MSM (77% vs. 58%, p<0.001) reported condom use at last sex with a paying client, and at last anal sex among MSM (80% vs. 77%, p<0.05) and PWID (48% vs. 27%, p<0.01). However, condom use with regular partners remained low, at less than 53% for FSWs and 69% for MSM. Among PWID, there was a significant increase in use of new needles and syringes at last injection (93% vs. 88%, p<0.001), and a significant decrease in reported non-availability of clean needles (23% vs. 36%, p<0.001). The number of overdoses in the past six months reduced significantly but remained high (40% vs. 51%, p<0.001). FSWs and MSM reported significantly higher HIV testing, and in all KP groups, over 93% reported ever having been tested for HIV. Among the respondents self-reporting to have tested HIV positive (24% of FSW, 22% of MSM and 19% of PWID), 80% of FSWs, 70% of MSM, and 73% of PWID reported currently taking antiretroviral therapy (ART). While the experience of forced intercourse by partners declined among FSWs (18% vs. 22%, p<0.01) and MSM (13% vs. 17%, p<0.01), more FSWs reported violence by law enforcement personnel (49% vs. 44%, p<0.001). These findings provide valuable information on the programme's progress, and a signpost for the integrated behavioural, biomedical and structural interventions to achieve their HIV prevention targets."
https://openalex.org/W2951914845,"Coprinopsis cinerea is a model mushroom particularly suited for the study of fungal fruiting body development and the evolution of multicellularity in fungi. While microRNAs (miRNAs) have been extensively studied in animals and plants for their essential roles in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, miRNAs in fungi are less well characterized and their potential roles in controlling mushroom development remain unknown. To identify miRNA-like RNAs (milRNAs) in C. cinerea and explore their expression patterns during the early developmental transition of mushroom development, small RNA libraries of vegetative mycelium and primordium were generated and putative milRNA candidates were identified following the standards of miRNA prediction in animals and plants. Two out of 22 novel predicted milRNAs, cci-milR-12c and cci-milR-13e-5p, were validated by northern blot and stem-loop reverse transcription real-time PCR. Cci-milR-12c was differentially expressed whereas the expression levels of cci-milR-13e-5p were similar in the two developmental stages. Target prediction of the validated milRNAs resulted in genes associated with fruiting body development, including pheromone, hydrophobin, cytochrome P450, and protein kinase. Essential genes for miRNA biogenesis, including three coding for Dicer-like (DCL), one for Argonaute (AGO), one for AGO-like and one for quelling deficient-2 (QDE-2) proteins, were also identified in the C. cinerea genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the DCL and AGO proteins of C. cinerea were more closely related to those in other basidiomycetes and ascomycetes than to those in animals and plants. Taken together, our findings provided the first evidence for milRNAs in the model mushroom and their potential roles in regulating fruiting body development. New information on the evolutionary relationship of milRNA biogenesis proteins across kingdoms has also provided new insights for guiding further functional and evolutionary studies of miRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2890163592,"In this study, a multi-stage optimization procedure is proposed to develop deep neural network models which results in a powerful deep learning pipeline called intelligent deep learning (iDeepLe). The proposed pipeline is then evaluated by a challenging real-world problem, the modeling of the spectral acceleration experienced by a particle during earthquakes. This approach has three main stages to optimize the deep model topology, the hyper-parameters, and its performance, respectively. This pipeline optimizes the deep model via adaptive learning rate optimization algorithms for both accuracy and complexity in multiple stages, while simultaneously solving the unknown parameters of the regression model. Among the seven adaptive learning rate optimization algorithms, Nadam optimization algorithm has shown the best performance results in the current study. The proposed approach is shown to be a suitable tool to generate solid models for this complex real-world system. The results also show that the parallel pipeline of iDeepLe has the capacity to handle big data problems as well."
https://openalex.org/W2890152053,"Depression frequently accompanies Parkinson's disease and often precedes the onset of motor symptoms. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of depression on motor compensation in patients with de novo Parkinson's disease. This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 474 non-demented patients with de novo Parkinson's disease (mean age, 64.6±9.8 years; 242 men) who underwent both dopamine transporter PET scan and depression assessment using the Beck Depression Inventory at baseline. Patients were classified into tertiles by Beck Depression Inventory score. At baseline, high-tertile group (Beck Depression Inventory score ≥15, n = 157) showed more severe motor deficits and lower cognitive function than low-tertile group (Beck Depression Inventory score ≤7, n = 158, P = 0.034 and P = 0.008, respectively). Greater motor deficits in high-tertile group than low-tertile group remained significant after controlling for dopamine transporter binding in the posterior putamen, as well as other confounding variables. During follow-up of a median duration of 47 months, high-tertile group received higher levodopa-equivalent doses for symptom control than did low-tertile group after controlling for age, gender, and initial motor deficit severity. These results demonstrate that depression in de novo Parkinson's disease is associated with motor deficit severity at baseline and dose of PD medications during follow-up, suggesting that the presence of depression in de novo Parkinson's disease represents poor motor compensation."
https://openalex.org/W2891726373,"Background We investigated progress towards UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets among female sex workers in Kampala, Uganda, who bear a disproportionate burden of HIV. Methods Between April and December 2012, 1,487 female sex workers, defined as women, 15–49 years, residing in greater Kampala, and selling sex for money in the last 6 months, were recruited using respondent-driven sampling. Venous blood was collected for HIV and viral load testing [viral load suppression (VLS) defined as <1,000 copies/mL]. We collected data using audio computer-assisted self-interviews and calculated weighted population-level estimates. Results The median age was 27 years (interquartile range: 23 to 32). HIV seroprevalence was 31.4% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29.0, 33.7%). Among all female sex workers who tested HIV-positive in the survey (population-level targets), 45.5% (95% CI: 40.1, 51.0) had knowledge of their serostatus (population-level target: 90%), 37.8% (95% CI: 32.2, 42.8) self-reported to be on ART (population-level target: 81%), and 35.2% (95% CI: 20.7, 30.4) were virally suppressed (population-level target: 73%). Conclusions HIV prevalence among Kampala female sex workers is high, whereas serostatus knowledge and VLS are far below UNAIDS targets. Kampala female sex workers are in need of intensified and targeted HIV prevention and control efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2889781295,"The 438–370-million-year-old galeaspids, diversified armoured jawless vertebrates (‘ostracoderms’) from China and northern Vietnam, were assumed to have a benthic feeding habit in a coastal, marine environment. Here, we describe two new genera of galeaspid fishes, Platylomaspis gen. nov. and Nanningaspis gen. nov. from the Middle Palaeozoic of China. The two new forms are characterized by a rostral process and strikingly broad ventral rim, and clustered with Gumuaspis to form a new family, Gumuaspidae, which represents the most primitive clade of Polybranchiaspiformes. They extend the earliest occurrence of Polybranchiaspiformes backward about 19 million years, and expand its geographical distribution from southern China and northern Vietnam to the Tarim Basin, northwestern China. The new taxa exhibit many morphological convergences with modern rays, and might specify a new kind of lifestyle of galeaspids, the half burrowing habit. Probably benefiting from the new lifestyle, the Gumuaspidae has become the longest lasting galeaspid family. The new findings demonstrated that the demersal galeaspids had developed three different kinds of lifestyles: semi-infaunal benthic (half buried), epibenthic, and suprabenthic (nektonic) habits to accommodate to differentiated ecological niches, and reached the peak of their diversity by the Pragian of the Early Devonian."
https://openalex.org/W2891215067,"Patients engaging in shared decision making must weigh the likelihood of positive and negative outcomes and deal with uncertainty and negative emotions in the situations where desirable options might not be available. The use of ""nudges,"" or communication techniques that influence patients' choices in a predictable direction, may assist patients in making complex decisions. However, nudging patients may be perceived as inappropriate influence on patients' choices. We sought to determine whether key stakeholders, physicians, and laypersons without clinical training consider the use of nudges to be ethical and appropriate in medical decision making. Eighty-nine resident-physicians and 336 Mechanical-Turk workers (i.e., non-clinicians) evaluated two hypothetical preference-sensitive situations, in which a patient with advanced cancer chooses between chemotherapy and hospice care. We varied the following: (1) whether or not the patient's decision was influenced by a mistaken judgment (i.e., decision-making bias) and (2) whether or not the physician used a nudge. Each participant reported the extent to which the communication was ethical, appropriate, and desirable. Both physicians and non-clinicians considered using nudges more positively than not using them, regardless of an initial decision-making bias in patients' considerations. Decomposing this effect, we found that physicians viewed the nudge that endorsed hospice care more favorably than the nudge that endorsed chemotherapy, while non-clinicians viewed the nudge that endorsed chemotherapy more favorably than the nudge that endorsed hospice care. We discuss implications and propose exploring further physicians' and patients' differences in the perception of nudges; the differences may suggest limitations for using nudges in medical decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2951356720,"A common measure of multisensory integration is the McGurk effect, an illusion in which incongruent auditory and visual speech are integrated to produce an entirely different percept. Published studies report that participants who differ in age, gender, culture, native language, or traits related to neurological or psychiatric disorders also differ in their susceptibility to the McGurk effect. These group-level differences are used as evidence for fundamental alterations in sensory processing between populations. Using empirical data and statistical simulations tested under a range of conditions, we show that published estimates of group differences in the McGurk effect are inflated when only statistically significant (p < 0.05) results are published. With a sample size typical of published studies, a group difference of 10% would be reported as 31%. As a consequence of this inflation, follow-up studies often fail to replicate published reports of large between-group differences. Inaccurate estimates of effect sizes and replication failures are especially problematic in studies of clinical populations involving expensive and time-consuming interventions, such as training paradigms to improve sensory processing. Reducing effect size inflation and increasing replicability requires increasing the number of participants by an order of magnitude compared with current practice."
https://openalex.org/W2951367955,"Objective To analyse the acute muscular fatigue (AMF) in triceps brachii and rectus abdominis during compression-only and standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performed by certified basic life support providers. Methods Twenty-six subjects were initially recruited and randomly allocated to two study groups according to the muscles analysed; eighteen finally met the inclusion criteria (nine in each group). Both groups carried out two CPR tests (compression-only and standard CPR) of 10 min divided into five 2-min intermittent periods. The ventilation method was freely chosen by each participant (mouth-to-mouth, pocket-mask or bag-valve-mask). CPR feedback was provided all the time. AMF was measured by tensiomyography at baseline and after each 2-min period of the CPR test, in triceps brachii or rectus abdominis according to the study group. Results Rectus abdominis’ contraction time increased significantly during the fifth CPR period (p = 0.020). Triceps brachii’s radial muscle belly displacement (p = 0.047) and contraction velocity (p = 0.018) were lower during compression-only CPR than during standard CPR. Participants who had trained previously with feedback devices achieved better CPR quality results in both protocols. Half of participants chose bag-valve-mask to perform ventilations but attained lower significant ventilation quality than the other subjects. Conclusions Compression-only CPR induces higher AMF than standard CPR. Significantly higher fatigue levels were found during the fifth CPR test period, regardless of the method. Adequate rescuer’s strength seems to be a requisite to take advantage of CPR quality feedback devices. Training should put more emphasis on the quality of ventilation during CPR."
https://openalex.org/W2890632696,"Flavonoids are one of the most important and diversified phenolic groups among products of natural origin. An important property of this metabolite class is the antioxidant action. This study evaluated the antioxidant and cytotoxic activities and oxidative stress of transesterification products of the flavonoid rutin, catalyzed by Novozym® 435. The presence of monoacetate and diacetate was confirmed by quantitative evaluation of the retention times (rutin, 15.68 min; rutin monoacetate, 18.14 min; and rutin diacetate, 18.57 min) and by the data from LC-MS and NMR 1H and 13C. The experiment showed excellent conversion values of 96% in total acetates (rutin monoacetate and diacetate). These results confirmed that rutin derivatives have antioxidant potential, as evaluated by the ORAC method (rutin standard: 0.53 ± 0.08 μM Trolox/g and rutin derivatives: 2.33 ± 1.08 μM Trolox/g) and also show low cytotoxicity in human and animal cells. Rutin derivatives reduced the production of reactive oxygen species in RAW macrophages as well. Many qualities attributed to rutin derivatives make them promising potential candidates for use as nutraceuticals, including their high amounts of antioxidants, biological potential and low toxicity, which contribute to the reduction of oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2891564219,"Stripe rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks, is an important disease of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide and there is an indication that it may also become a serious disease of durum wheat (T. turgidum L. var. durum). Therefore, we investigated the genetic architecture underlying resistance to stripe rust in adapted durum wheat germplasm. Wheat infection assays were conducted under controlled conditions in Canada and under field conditions in Mexico. Disease assessments were performed on a population of 155 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from the cross of Kofa (susceptible) and W9262-260D3 (moderately resistant) and on a breeding panel that consisted of 92 diverse cultivars and breeding lines. Both populations were genotyped using the 90K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) iSelect assay. In the DH population, QTL for stripe rust resistance were identified on chromosome 7B (LOD 6.87–11.47) and chromosome 5B (LOD 3.88–9.17). The QTL for stripe rust resistance on chromosome 7B was supported in the breeding panel. Both QTL were anchored to the genome sequence of wild emmer wheat, which identified gene candidates involved in disease resistance. Exome capture sequencing identified variation in the candidate genes between Kofa and W9262-260D3. These genetic insights will be useful in durum breeding to enhance resistance to stripe rust."
https://openalex.org/W2891282619,"Introduction Chronic Low Back Pain (CLBP) is a heterogeneous condition with lack of diagnostic clarity. Therapeutic interventions show small effects. To improve outcomes by targeting interventions it is recommended to develop a triage system to surgical and non-surgical treatments based on treatment outcomes. The objective of the current study was to develop and internally validate prognostic models based on pre-treatment patient-reported profiles that identify patients who either respond or do not respond to two frequently performed treatments (lumbar spine surgery and multidisciplinary pain management program). Methods A consecutive cohort study in a secondary referral spine center was performed. The study followed the recommendations of the PROGRESS framework and was registered in the Dutch Trial Register (NTR5946). Data of forty-seven potential pre-consultation (baseline) indicators predicting ‘response’ or ‘non-response’ at one-year follow-up for the two treatments were obtained to develop and validate four multivariable logistic regression models. The source population consisted of 3,410 referred CLBP-patients. Two treatment cohorts were defined: elective ‘spine surgery’ (n = 217 [6.4%]) and multidisciplinary bio-psychosocial ‘pain management program’ (n = 171 [5.0%]). Main inclusion criteria were age ≥18, CLBP (≥6 months), and not responding to primary care treatment. The primary outcome was functional ability: ‘response’ (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI] ≤22) and ‘non-response’ (ODI ≥41). Results Baseline indicators predictive of treatment outcome were: degree of disability (all models), ≥2 previous spine surgeries, psychosocial complaints, age (onset <20 or >50), and patient expectations of treatment outcomes. The explained variances were low for the models predicting response and non-response to pain management program (R2 respectively 23% and 26%) and modest for surgery (R2 30% and 39%). The overall performance was acceptable (c-index; 0.72–0.83), the model predicting non-response to surgery performed best (R2 = 39%; c-index = 0.83). Conclusion This study was the first to identify different patient-reported profiles that predict response to different treatments for CLBP. The model predicting ‘non-response’ to elective lumbar spine surgery performed remarkably well, suggesting that referrals of these patients to a spine surgeon could be avoided. After external validation, the patient-reported profiles could potentially enhance timely patient triage to the right secondary care specialist and improve decision-making between clinican and patient. This could lead to improved treatment outcomes, which results in a more efficient use of healthcare resources."
https://openalex.org/W2891534298,"Individual differences in animal personality and external appearance such as colouration patterns have both been extensively studied separately. A significant body of research has explored many of pertinent ecological and biological aspects that can be affected by them and their impact upon fitness. Currently little is known about how both factors interact and their effect on reproductive success. In this study, we evaluated two major parameters contributing to the fitness of the species: reproduction and offspring survival. We selected two different phenotypes of the zebrafish (Danio rerio) selected by their colouration patterns: phenotype 1) named Wild type, UAB line (WT-UAB) with a homogeneous colouration pattern (clear and defined lateral stripes) and phenotype 2) Wild type indefinite (WT-I) had a heterogeneous colouration pattern and different degrees of lateral stripe definition. All animals were also screened for personality. We then compared their reproductive success (spawning rate) and offspring survival at different stages, from egg to larvae, and for 2 successive generations (parental generation was G0; First and second generations were G1 and G2 respectively). Our results show that personality traits were the main source of variability between the fitness components measured: both personalities had similar total numbers of eggs spawned but proactive animals, for both colour phenotypes, had higher reproductive success. This was reflected in a higher percentage of spawning viability at 1day post fertilization (dpf), higher total survival and growth rates at larval stages. Proactive phenotypes from WT-UAB population had a higher overall fitness in comparison to the other phenotypes studied. Our findings imply that fitness of this species when kept under similar husbandry conditions is significantly influenced by parental personality and not by their external appearance. Under these conditions the reproductive success is enhanced. The implications of this study are important for zebrafish breeding and husbandry in captivity and are relevant toward understanding the underlying drivers of trait selection in natural environments."
https://openalex.org/W2889660957,"Megakaryocytes (Mks) derive from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in the bone marrow and develop into large, polyploid cells that eventually give rise to platelets. As Mks mature, they migrate from the bone marrow niche into the vasculature, where they are exposed to shear forces from blood flow, releasing Mk particles (platelet-like particles (PLPs), pro/preplatelets (PPTs), and Mk microparticles (MkMPs)) into circulation. We have previously shown that transcription factor p53 is important in Mk maturation, and that physiological levels of shear promote Mk particle generation and platelet biogenesis. Here we examine the role of p53 in the Mk shear-stress response. We show that p53 is acetylated in response to shear in both immature and mature Mks, and that decreased expression of deacetylase HDAC1, and increased expression of the acetyltransferases p300 and PCAF might be responsible for these changes. We also examined the hypothesis that p53 might be involved in the shear-induced Caspase 3 activation, phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization, and increased biogenesis of PLPs, PPTs, and MkMPs. We show that p53 is involved in all these shear-induced processes. We show that in response to shear, acetyl-p53 binds Bax, cytochrome c is released from mitochondria, and Caspase 9 is activated. We also show that shear-stimulated Caspase 9 activation and Mk particle biogenesis depend on transcription-independent p53-induced apoptosis (TIPA), but PS externalization is not. This is the first report to show that shear flow stimulates TIPA and that Caspase 9 activation and Mk-particle biogenesis are directly modulated by TIPA."
https://openalex.org/W2889655056,"Several hypotheses are used to explain species richness patterns. Some of them (e.g. species-area, species-energy, environment-energy, water-energy, terrestrial primary productivity, environmental spatial heterogeneity, and climatic heterogeneity) are known to explain species richness patterns of terrestrial organisms, especially when they are combined. For aquatic organisms, however, it is unclear if these hypotheses can be useful to explain for these purposes. Therefore, we used a selection model approach to assess the predictive capacity of such hypotheses, and to determine which of them (combined or not) would be the most appropriate to explain the fish species distribution in small Brazilian streams. We perform the Akaike’s information criteria for models selections and the eigenvector analysis to control the special autocorrelation. The spatial structure was equal to 0.453, Moran’s I, and require 11 spatial filters. All models were significant and had adjustments ranging from 0.370 to 0.416 with strong spatial component (ranging from 0.226 to 0.369) and low adjustments for environmental data (ranging from 0.001 to 0.119) We obtained two groups of hypothesis are able to explain the richness pattern (1) water-energy, temporal productivity-heterogeneity (AIC = 4498.800) and (2) water-energy, temporal productivity-heterogeneity and area (AIC = 4500.400). We conclude that the fish richness patterns in small Brazilian streams are better explained by a combination of Water-Energy + Productivity + Temporal Heterogeneity hypotheses and not by just one."

Diving mammals are adapted to sustain oxidative metabolism in hypoxic conditions through several metabolic adaptations, including improved capacity for oxygen transport and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in skeletal muscle. It was hypothesized that similar adaptations characterized human BHD. Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the capacity for oxidative metabolism in skeletal muscle of BHD compared to matched controls.Biopsies were obtained from the lateral vastus of the femoral muscle from 8 Danish BHD and 8 non-diving controls (Judo athletes) matched for morphometry and whole body VO2max. High resolution respirometry was used to determine mitochondrial respiratory capacity and leak respiration with simultaneous measurement of mitochondrial H2O2 emission. Maximal citrate synthase (CS) and 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase (HAD) activity were measured in muscle tissue homogenates. Western Blotting was used to determine protein contents of respiratory complex I-V subunits and myoglobin in muscle tissue lysates.Muscle biopsies of BHD revealed lower mitochondrial leak respiration and electron transfer system (ETS) capacity and higher H2O2 emission during leak respiration than controls, with no differences in enzyme activities (CS and HAD) or protein content of mitochondrial complex subunits myoglobin, myosin heavy chain isoforms, markers of glucose metabolism and antioxidant enzymes.We demonstrated for the first time in humans, that the skeletal muscles of BHD are characterized by lower mitochondrial oxygen consumption both during low leak and high (ETS) respiration than matched controls. This supports previous observations of diving mammals demonstrating a lower aerobic mitochondrial capacity of the skeletal muscles as an oxygen conserving adaptation during prolonged dives."

However, a practice model for early integration of palliative home care (PHC) into standard care for end-stage COPD has not been fully developed.To develop an intervention for early integration of PHC into standard care for end-stage COPD patients.We conducted a Phase 0-I study according to the Medical Research Council Framework for the development of complex interventions. Phase 0 aimed to identify the inclusion criteria and key components of the intervention by way of an explorative literature search of interventions, expert consultations, and seven focus groups with general practitioners and community nurses on perceived barriers to and facilitators of early integrated PHC for COPD. In Phase 1, the intervention, its inclusion criteria and its components were developed and further refined by an expert panel and two expert opinions.Phase 0 resulted in identification of inclusion criteria and components from existing interventions, and barriers to and facilitators of early integration of PHC for end-stage COPD. Based on these findings, a nurse-led intervention was developed in Phase I consisting of training for PHC nurses in symptom recognition and physical therapy exercises for end-stage COPD, regular visits by PHC nurses at the patients' homes, two information leaflets on self-management, a semi-structured protocol and follow-up plan to record the outcomes of the home visits, and integration of care by enabling collaboration and communication between home and hospital-based professional caregivers.This Phase 0-I trial succeeded in developing a complex intervention for early integration of PHC for end-stage COPD. The use of three methods in Phase 0 gave reliable data on which to base inclusion criteria and components of the intervention. The preliminary effectiveness, feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will be subsequently tested in a Phase II study."
https://openalex.org/W2891662077,"This study was conducted during the 2014 and 2015 vintages on Vitis vinifera L. cv. Merlot and Cabernet Gernischt to investigate whether natural variation in berry size could affect grape aromatic compounds. Grape berries were separated into three size categories based on their diameter: small, middle and large. The results showed that berry size exerted a significant influence on the volatile profiles of both winegrape varieties. Hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that the volatile profiles of middle berries were different from those of large and small berries. Middle berries had the greatest abundance of aroma compounds, followed by small and large berries. Especially, C6/C9 compounds, norisoprenoids, terpenoids showed markedly different concentrations among differently sized Merlot berries and C6/C9 compounds, terpenoids among differently sized Cabernet Gernischt berries. Middle berries of both grape varieties may possess the greatest intensity of fresh-green, fruity and floral aromas due to the high odour activity values (OAVs) of decanal, hexanal, (E)-2-hexenal, (E)-β-damascenone and β-ionone in middle sizes of Merlot berries and the high OAVs of (E)-2-hexenal and (E)-β-damascenone in middle sizes of Cabernet Gernischt berries. This knowledge could be important for winemakers to conduct targeted berry sorting, thereby improving the aromatic quality of grapes."
https://openalex.org/W2952151144,"This paper applies objective methods to explore the technological origins of the widely acclaimed CRISPR breakthrough in the technological domain of genome engineering. Previously developed patent search techniques are first used to recover a set of patents that well-represent the genome editing domain before CRISPR. Main paths are then determined from the citation network associated with this patent set allowing identification of the three major knowledge trajectories. The most significant of these trajectories for CRISPR involves the core of genome editing with less significant trajectories involving cloning and endonuclease specific developments. The major patents on the core trajectory are consistent with qualitative expert knowledge of the topical area. A second set of patents that we call the CRISPR roots are obtained by finding the patents directly cited by the recent CRISPR patents along with patents cited by that set of patents. We find that the CRISPR roots contain 8 key patents from the genome engineering main path associated with restriction endonucleases and the expected strong connection of CRISPR to prior genome editing technology such as Zn finger nucleases. Nonetheless, analysis of the full CRISPR roots shows that a very wide array of technological knowledge beyond genome engineering has contributed to achieving the CRISPR breakthrough. Such breadth in origins is not surprising since “spillover” is generally perceived as important and previous qualitative studies of CRISPR have shown not only technological breadth in origins but scientific breadth as well. In addition, we find that the estimated rate of functional performance improvement of the CRISPR roots set is about 9% per year compared to the genome engineering set (~4% per year). These estimates indicate below average rates of improvement and may indicate that CRISPR (and perhaps yet undiscovered) genome engineering developments could evolve in effectiveness over an upcoming long rather than short time period."
https://openalex.org/W2890700209,"This study investigated the use of scientific evidence and the practice of evidence-based dentistry (EBD) among dentists working in Brazil. An online questionnaire was emailed to dentists registered with Brazilian state dental councils. The questionnaire assessed the demographic, educational, and work characteristics of the sample, along with habits in reading scientific articles and other updating resources. Data were analyzed descriptively and by using Bonferroni, Kruskal-Wallis, ANOVA, and T-test statistical methods (α = 0.05). A total of 795 responses were received between June, 2015 and January, 2016. The response rate was not calculated because it was not possible to determine precisely how many dentists received these e-mails. Over 77% of the responding dentists completed postgraduate training. They referred mainly to books, scientific or clinical journals, conferences, and short-term courses for updating their knowledge. Dentists who reported having a habit of reading scientific journals (60.9%) showed a preference for reading case reports, clinical research articles, and literature reviews. Most dentists (77.5%) reported changing their clinical behaviors or procedures based on information gleaned from journal articles. The types of articles that led them to change their clinical practices were primarily clinical research articles and case reports. Working in the public sector was also associated with a lower prevalence of a habit of reading scientific journals and practicing EBD (i.e., self-reported practice). The results suggest that dentists are interested in reading journal articles, especially those addressing clinical outcomes, and that there is room for improving the practice of EBD, particularly in the public sector."

The aggregation method is an easier alternative, but the conventional aggregation protocol still requires special skills. To make the aggregation method easier and more precise, here we developed a micro-aggregation device. Unlike conventional 3-dimensional culture, which uses hanging-drop devices for aggregation, we fabricated a polystyrene funnel-like structure to smoothly drop ESCs into a small area (300-μm in diameter) at the bottom of the device. The bottom area was designed so that the surface tension of the liquid-air interface prevents the cells from falling. After aggregation, the cells can be recovered by simply exerting pressure on the liquid from the top. The microdevice can be set upon a regular 96-well plate, so it is compatible with multichannel pipette use or machine operation. Using the microdevice, we successfully obtained chimeric blastocysts, which when transplanted resulted in completely ESC-derived chimeric mice with high efficiency. By changing the number of ESCs in the aggregate, we found that the optimum number of co-cultured ESCs was around 90~120 per embryo. Under this condition, the efficiency of generating completely ESC-derived mice was the same or better than that of the injection method. These results indicated that our microdevice can be used to produce completely ESC-derived chimeric mice easily and with a high success rate, and thus represents a promising alternative to the conventional microinjection or aggregation method, especially for high-throughput, parallel experimental applications."
https://openalex.org/W2952631288,"Heavy metal and metalloid contaminations are among the most concerning types of pollutant in the environment. Consequently, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms of cellular responses and detoxification pathways for these compounds in living organisms. To date, a number of genes have been linked to the detoxification process. The expression of these genes can be controlled at both transcriptional and translational levels. In baker's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, resistance to a wide range of toxic metals is regulated by glutathione S-transferases. Yeast URE2 encodes for a protein that has glutathione peroxidase activity and is homologous to mammalian glutathione S-transferases. The URE2 expression is critical to cell survival under heavy metal stress. Here, we report on the finding of two genes, ITT1, an inhibitor of translation termination, and RPS1A, a small ribosomal protein, that when deleted yeast cells exhibit similar metal sensitivity phenotypes to gene deletion strain for URE2. Neither of these genes were previously linked to metal toxicity. Our gene expression analysis illustrates that these two genes affect URE2 mRNA expression at the level of translation."
https://openalex.org/W2889720386,"To evaluate the accuracy of CT for small, hypervascular hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and assess the enhancement patterns on CT.Ninety-nine patients who underwent cone-beam CT hepatic arteriography (CBCT-HA) during initial chemoembolization for HCC suspected on CT were enrolled in this study. A total of 297 hypervascular HCCs (142 ≥ 1 cm, 155 < 1 cm) were confirmed as HCCs based on two-year follow-up CT and CBCT-HA images. During the two-year follow-up, pre-existing hypervascular foci on CBCT-HA were regarded as HCCs at the initial presentation. Two radiologists categorized HCCs according to the following enhancement patterns on CT: type I, arterial enhancement and washout; type II, arterial enhancement without washout; and type III, no arterial enhancement. Two blinded reviewers rated the possibility of HCC.For the 297 HCCs, the enhancement patterns according to size were as follows: type I ≥1 cm in 114 HCCs; type I <1 cm in 40 HCCs; type II ≥1 cm in 16 HCCs; type II <1 cm in 37 HCCs; type III ≥1 cm in 12 HCCs; and type III <1 cm in 10 HCCs. The remaining 68 HCCs (22.9%) were not detected on CT. The detection rates of HCCs ≥ 1 cm were 83.1%, 76.8%, and 83.1% in the formal report for reviewer 1 and reviewer 2. In comparison, the detection rates of HCCs < 1 cm were 20.6%, 17.4%, and 17.4% in the formal report for reviewer 1 and reviewer 2.Many subcentimeter sized hypervascular HCCs were frequently missed or not evident on CT at the initial diagnostic workup. CT has limitations for diagnosing HCCs that are <1 cm in size or have atypical enhancement patterns."
https://openalex.org/W2890093726,"Over the last few years, several of the world’s national park networks have implemented ecological integrity monitoring programs. These programs are based on a series of indicators to detect changes in ecosystem integrity. There are many scientific and logistical challenges in developing these programs due to limits in both our knowledge of ecosystems functioning and the resources for implementing such programs. Thus, the relatively quick and simple implementation of many monitoring programs has been to the detriment of their scientific validity. Few studies have focused on evaluating an entire monitoring program. This project presents an approach to evaluate the ecological and statistical relevance of ecosystem integrity indicators measured within a program with the goal of iterative optimization. The approach is based on three complementary elements: (1) spatial characterization of park ecosystems based on the classification of satellite imagery, (2) ecological validation of indicators based on ecosystem conceptual models and (3) statistical validation of indicators based on analyses of statistical power. This innovative approach allows a systematic, quantified, reproducible and generalizable review of the indicators of an ecological integrity monitoring program. It provides managers with an overview of the spatial representativeness of indicators, their ecological and statistical relevance according to different parameters such as the period monitored, the amount of change to be detected, and the degree of significance. Thus, the approach identifies monitoring gaps and offers various alternatives for improving sampling. The approach was developed and tested in the network of Quebec national parks, more specifically in the Frontenac, Jacques-Cartier and Bic national parks. The results clearly identify the strengths and weaknesses of the current program in place and possible improvements are proposed for these parks. This approach is a relevant tool for park networks, particularly for those that have limited resources for monitoring ecological integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2890275096,"Ensuring quality of care in nursing homes is a public health priority, yet how nursing home quality relates to cost is not well understood. This paper addresses this relationship for 132 VA community living centers (nursing homes), for fiscal years 2014 and 2015. We estimated cost models using the VA Decision Support System which tracks total direct costs and nursing direct costs for individual resident segments of care. We summed residents’ total costs and nursing costs to the community living center level for each year. Annual facility costs then were regressed on quality of care measured with composite scores based on 13 distinct adverse events. Results indicated that higher quality was associated with higher predicted cost. However, we did not find evidence that higher costs were driven by high nurse staffing levels."
https://openalex.org/W2889921656,"Minimization functionals related to Euler's elastica energy has a broad range of applications in computer vision and image processing. This paper proposes a novel Euler's elastica and curvature-based variational model for image restoration corrupted with multiplicative noise. It combines Euler's elastica curvature with a Weberized total variation (TV) regularization and gets a novel Euler's elastica energy and TV-based minimization functional. The combined approach in this variational model can preserve edges while reducing the blocky effect in smooth regions. The implicit gradient descent scheme is applied to efficiently finding the minimizer of the proposed functional. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in visual improvement, as well as an increase in the peak signal-to-noise ratio, compared to the PDE-based methods."
https://openalex.org/W2891456804,"Most known giant viruses, i.e., viruses producing giant virions, parasitize amoebae and other unicellular eukaryotes. Although they vary in the level of dependence on host nuclear functions, their virions self-assemble in the host cell’s cytoplasm. Here we report the discovery of a new prototype of giant virus infecting epidermal cells of the marine arrow worm Adhesisagitta hispida. Its 1.25 μm-long virions self-assemble and accumulate in the host cell’s nucleus. Conventional transmission electron microscopy reveals that the virions have a unique bipartite structure. An ovoid nucleocapsid, situated in a broad “head” end of the virion is surrounded by a thin envelope. The latter extends away from the head to form a voluminous conical “tail” filled with electron-dense extracapsidular material. The 31nm-thick capsid wall has a distinctive substructure resulting from a patterned arrangement of subunits; it bears no ultrastructural resemblance to the virion walls of other known giant viruses. The envelope self-assembles coincident with the capsid and remotely from all host membranes. We postulate that transmission to new hosts occurs by rupture of protruding virion-filled nuclei when infected arrow worms mate. Future genomic work is needed to determine the phylogenetic position of this new virus, which we have provisionally named Meelsvirus."
https://openalex.org/W2891537361,"Small birds use cavities for roosting to decrease the thermoregulatory costs during the winter nights. The ability of birds to detect and escape from an approaching predator is impaired during roosting and thus the selection of such cavities should take into account the risk that a predator will find the cavity. Previous evidence suggested that birds in captivity are able to detect predator scent and avoid roosting in nest-boxes containing such predator chemical cues. Here, we tested whether birds also show this avoidance response under natural conditions. We performed three studies in three populations of blue and great tits. We added predator scent, a pungency scent or an odourless control to nest-boxes and compared the use of these nest-boxes for roosting. We found no differences between the scent treatments in the use of nest-boxes. Therefore, chemical cues indicating the potential presence of a predator are not enough for birds to avoid roosting in nest-boxes under natural conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2891816279,"Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ13C) in plant leaves generally decreases with increasing altitude in mountains. Lower foliar Δ13C at high elevation usually is associated with higher leaf mass per area (LMA) in thicker leaves. However, it is unclear if lower foliar Δ13C in high-altitude plants is caused by improved photosynthetic capacity as an effect of higher nutrient, especially nitrogen, content in thicker leaves. We investigated trends of foliar Δ13C in four species, each belonging to a different plant functional type (PFT), across two altitudinal gradients, each on a different bedrock type (carbonate and silicate bedrock, respectively) in a region of the southern Alps (Italy) where the foliar Δ13C was not affected by water limitation. Our objective was to assess whether the altitudinal patterns of foliar Δ13C in relation to leaf morphology and foliar nutrients were conditioned by indirect control of bedrock geology on soil nutrient availability. The foliar Δ13C of the four species was mainly affected by LMA and, secondarily, by stomatal density (SD) but the relative importance of these foliar traits varied among species. Area-based nutrient contents had overall minor importance in controlling C discrimination. Relationships among foliar Δ13C, foliar nutrient content and leaf growth rate strongly depended on soil nutrient availability varying differently across the two gradients. In the absence of water limitation, the foliar Δ13C was primarily controlled by irradiance which can shape anatomical leaf traits, especially LMA and/or SD, whose relative importance in determining C isotope discrimination differed among species and/or PFT. Decreasing foliar Δ13C across altitudinal gradients need not be determined by improved photosynthetic capacity deriving from higher nutrient content in thicker leaves."
https://openalex.org/W2891257492,"This paper intends to evaluate the influence of content of rice husk fiber and cementitious materials on mechanical properties and thermal conductivity of thermal insulation wallboards. Thermal insulation wallboard contained different mass of rice husk fiber was prepared when the weight of cement, fly ash, cellulose ether, naphthalene superplasticizer, and recycled concrete aggregates was equal. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) shows the internal structure of the insulation wallboards is very dense. Compared to thermal conductivity of blank group (0.9600 W/m·°C), B2 (0.1997 W/m·°C) and C2 (0.1810 W/m·°C) measured by the DRCD-3030 intelligent thermal conductivity tester can meet certain engineering requirements. Average compressive strength, flexural strength, and thermal conductivity of wallboards decreases with content of rice husk fiber increasing when other materials mass are the same. Under the same conditions of curing time and rice husk content, average compressive and flexural strength increase with the increase of the amount of cementitious material."
https://openalex.org/W2891455144,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified as important contributors to the regulation of early fetal cardiopulmonary development. However, miRNA expression profiles during late gestation and the early neonatal period are not fully elaborated in large mammals such as sheep (ovis aries). The aim of this study was to sequence miRNA from cardiopulmonary tissues in late gestation and neonate sheep to identify changes in miRNA expression.Illumina HiSeq next-generation deep sequencing (NGS) was performed on ovine tissues from the left (LV) and right ventricles (RV), lungs and pulmonary artery (PA) of preterm fetuses (128 days), near-term fetuses (140 days) (term = 148 days) and neonatal lambs (5 days). NGS reads were mapped to the sheep genome (OviAri) and published miRNA sequences.Of 1345 cardiopulmonary miRNAs that were sequenced, relatively few major shifts in miRNA expression were detected with increased age from near term to neonates, and were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR: bta-miR-146a (lung), bta-miR-22-3p (lung, LV), hsa-miR-335* (lung, PA), and miR-210 (lung, PA, LV).Sequencing of miRNA led to identification of four predominant miRNA in ovine cardiopulmonary tissues which alter expression during late gestation and the early neonatal period, concurrent with important functional changes in heart and lungs."
