https://openalex.org/W2753696808,"Over the last decades agroforestry parklands in Burkina Faso have come under increasing demographic as well as climatic pressures, which are threatening indigenous tree species that contribute substantially to income generation and nutrition in rural households. Analyzing the threats as well as the species vulnerability to them is fundamental for priority setting in conservation planning. Guided by literature and local experts we selected 16 important food tree species (Acacia macrostachya, Acacia senegal, Adansonia digitata, Annona senegalensis, Balanites aegyptiaca, Bombax costatum, Boscia senegalensis, Detarium microcarpum, Lannea microcarpa, Parkia biglobosa, Sclerocarya birrea, Strychnos spinosa, Tamarindus indica, Vitellaria paradoxa, Ximenia americana, Ziziphus mauritiana) and six key threats to them (overexploitation, overgrazing, fire, cotton production, mining and climate change). We developed a species-specific and spatially explicit approach combining freely accessible datasets, species distribution models (SDMs), climate models and expert survey results to predict, at fine scale, where these threats are likely to have the greatest impact. We find that all species face serious threats throughout much of their distribution in Burkina Faso and that climate change is predicted to be the most prevalent threat in the long term, whereas overexploitation and cotton production are the most important short-term threats. Tree populations growing in areas designated as 'highly threatened' due to climate change should be used as seed sources for ex situ conservation and planting in areas where future climate is predicting suitable habitats. Assisted regeneration is suggested for populations in areas where suitable habitat under future climate conditions coincides with high threat levels due to short-term threats. In the case of Vitellaria paradoxa, we suggest collecting seed along the northern margins of its distribution and considering assisted regeneration in the central part where the current threat level is high due to overexploitation. In the same way, population-specific recommendations can be derived from the individual and combined threat maps of the other 15 food tree species. The approach can be easily transferred to other countries and can be used to analyze general and species specific threats at finer and more local as well as at broader (continental) scales in order to plan more selective and efficient conservation actions in time. The concept can be applied anywhere as long as appropriate spatial data are available as well as knowledgeable experts."

Accordingly, it is necessary for researchers to achieve a comprehensive and deep understanding of the associations between microbes and diseases. Nevertheless, to date, little work has been achieved in implementing novel human microbe-disease association prediction models. In this paper, we develop a novel computational model to predict potential microbe-disease associations by bi-random walk on the heterogeneous network (BiRWHMDA). The heterogeneous network was constructed by connecting the microbe similarity network and the disease similarity network via known microbe-disease associations. Microbe similarity and disease similarity were calculated by the Gaussian interaction profile kernel similarity measure; moreover, a logistic function was applied to regulate disease similarity. Additionally, leave-one-out cross validation and 5-fold cross validation were implemented to evaluate the predictive performance of our method; both cross validation methods performed well. The leave-one-out cross validation experiment results illustrate that our method outperforms other previously proposed methods. Furthermore, case studies on asthma and inflammatory bowel disease prove the favorable performance of our method. In conclusion, our method can be considered as an effective computational model for predicting novel microbe-disease associations."
https://openalex.org/W2753251906,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) represents one of the poultry industry major threats, particularly in high density producing countries. The emergence and spread of new IBV genotypes have frustrated the various disease control efforts implemented over time. Despite that, few comprehensive and large scale studies have been performed to understand the international and local spreading dynamics of this virus. In the present work, these phenomena were evaluated by implementing a Bayesian phylodynamic approach to reconstruct the epidemiological patterns and population history of the QX genotype (currently renamed GI-19 lineage), the most relevant IBV lineage of the Old-World. Our analysis, based on 807 partial S1 sequences of strains collected from 18 countries between 1993 and 2015, demonstrates that this genotype originated in China well before its first identification. After a prolonged local circulation, it started spreading to other European, Asian and Middle East countries in successive waves, which were mirrored by concomitant fluctuations in viral population size. Interestingly, the within-Europe spread was characterized by a higher estimated migration rate compared with the inter-continental one, potentially reflecting the closer geographic and economic relationships among these countries. Nevertheless, the colonization of new states by the GI-19 lineage appeared to occur mostly by single introduction events in both intra and inter-continental spread, likely because of epidemiological factor and health policy combination which seems to prevent the frequent introduction and mixing of different strains. On the other hand, the within Italy QX circulation reconstruction showed a much more intricate connection network among different locations, evidencing the difficulty in controlling IBV spread especially in highly densely poultry populated areas. The presence of several well supported epidemiological links among distantly related Italian regions testifies that animal transportation and indirect transmission routes rather than local airborne diffusion contribute to the QX success and persistence at local scale. Globally, the spreading dynamics and evolution of the QX genotype were reconstructed from its very origin to nowadays, demonstrating the need of more effective direct control measures, particularly within each country. Unfortunately, the incompleteness of available molecular epidemiology data represents an insurmountable limit which leaves many questions currently unsolved, thus highlighting the compulsoriness of a structured monitoring and data sharing system implementation."
https://openalex.org/W2753344937,"We aimed to evaluate perioperative outcomes in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy with or without a cardiac output goal directed therapy (GDT) algorithm. We conducted a multicentre randomised controlled trial in four high volume hepatobiliary-pancreatic surgery centres. We evaluated whether the additional impact of a intraoperative fluid optimisation algorithm would influence the amount of fluid delivered, reduce fluid related complications, and improve length of hospital stay. Fifty-two consecutive adult patients were recruited. The median (IQR) duration of surgery was 8.6 hours (7.1:9.6) in the GDT group vs. 7.8 hours (6.8:9.0) in the usual care group (p = 0.2). Intraoperative fluid balance was 1005mL (475:1873) in the GDT group vs. 3300mL (2474:3874) in the usual care group (p<0.0001). Total volume of fluid administered intraoperatively was also lower in the GDT group: 2050mL (1313:2700) vs. 4088mL (3400:4525), p<0.0001 and vasoactive medications were used more frequently. There were no significant differences in proportions of patients experiencing overall complications (p = 0.179); however, fewer complications occurred in the GDT group: 44 vs. 92 (Incidence Rate Ratio: 0.41; 95%CI 0.24 to 0.69, p = 0.001). Median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 9.5 days (IQR: 7.0, 14.3) in the GDT vs. 12.5 days in the usual care group (IQR: 9.0, 22.3) for an Incidence Rate Ratio 0.64 (95% CI 0.48 to 0.85, p = 0.002). In conclusion, using a surgery-specific, patient-specific goal directed restrictive fluid therapy algorithm in this cohort of patients, can justify using enough fluid without causing oedema, yet as little fluid as possible without causing hypovolaemia i.e. ""precision"" fluid therapy. Our findings support the use of a perioperative haemodynamic optimization plan that prioritizes preservation of cardiac output and organ perfusion pressure by judicious use of fluid therapy, rational use of vasoactive drugs and timely application of inotropic drugs. They also suggest the need for further larger studies to confirm its findings."
https://openalex.org/W2753815299,"The rate of photosynthesis depends on the CO2 partial pressure near Rubisco, Cc, which is commonly calculated by models using the overall mesophyll resistance. Such models do not explain the difference between the CO2 level in the intercellular air space and Cc mechanistically. This problem can be overcome by reaction-diffusion models for CO2 transport, production and fixation in leaves. However, most reaction-diffusion models are complex and unattractive for procedures that require a large number of runs, like parameter optimisation. This study provides a simpler reaction-diffusion model. It is parameterized by both leaf physiological and leaf anatomical data. The anatomical data consisted of the thickness of the cell wall, cytosol and stroma, and the area ratios of mesophyll exposed to the intercellular air space to leaf surfaces and exposed chloroplast to exposed mesophyll surfaces. The model was used directly to estimate photosynthetic parameters from a subset of the measured light and CO2 response curves; the remaining data were used for validation. The model predicted light and CO2 response curves reasonably well for 15 days old tomato (cv. Admiro) leaves, if (photo)respiratory CO2 release was assumed to take place in the inner cytosol or in the gaps between the chloroplasts. The model was also used to calculate the fraction of CO2 produced by (photo)respiration that is re-assimilated in the stroma, and this fraction ranged from 56 to 76%. In future research, the model should be further validated to better understand how the re-assimilation of (photo)respired CO2 is affected by environmental conditions and physiological parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2752756333,"Ten-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) was introduced in the National Immunization Program of Brazil in March/2010. Although there are recent reports of PCV10 impact on pneumonia hospitalizations, there is still uncertainty regarding the indirect impact in individuals non-targeted by vaccination. We assessed both direct and indirect effect of PCV10 on pneumonia hospitalizations and the impact on the economic burden of pneumonia hospitalizations.An interrupted time-series analysis was conducted considering monthly rates of pneumonia hospitalizations and comparison groups, in all age-groups, from January/2005-December/2015. We used records of the National Hospitalizations Information System. Observed pneumonia rates in the post-vaccination period (2011–2015) were compared to predicted rates, should PCV10 had not been introduced. Relative percent difference in rates and its 95% confidence interval were estimated. The number of pneumonia hospitalizations averted by vaccination was calculated as the difference between the predicted and observed cumulative number of pneumonia hospitalizations in the post-vaccination period. The impact of PCV10 on economic burden was presented as averted costs of pneumonia hospitalization.Significant decrease in rates of pneumonia hospitalization was observed in both children targeted by vaccination (17.4%–26.5%; p<0.01), and in age-groups not targeted by vaccination (11.1%–27.1%, in individuals 10–49 years; p<0.01). In contrast, PCV10 introduction did not alter the increasing trends in pneumonia hospitalization among elderly ≥65 years. A total of 457,564 pneumonia hospitalizations was averted in Brazil for individuals aged <50 years, with a total averted costs of BRL 383.2 million (Int$ 225.2 million, and USD 147 million) for the 5 year period after PCV introduction.Vaccination with PCV10 5 years after its introduction in Brazil was associated with a relevant reduction in pneumonia hospitalization in the target age-groups, with an indirect effect in individuals aged 10–49 years, and significant reduction in associated economic burden. The increasing trends in pneumonia hospitalization rates in the elderly is a matter of concern for public health and should be further investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2752859048,"Background Assessment of health benefits associated with physical activity depend on the activity duration, intensity and frequency, therefore their correct identification is very valuable and important in epidemiological and clinical studies. The aims of this study are: to develop an algorithm for automatic identification of intended jogging periods; and to assess whether the identification performance is improved when using two accelerometers at the hip and ankle, compared to when using only one at either position. Methods The study used diarized jogging periods and the corresponding accelerometer data from thirty-nine, 15-year-old adolescents, collected under field conditions, as part of the GINIplus study. The data was obtained from two accelerometers placed at the hip and ankle. Automated feature engineering technique was performed to extract features from the raw accelerometer readings and to select a subset of the most significant features. Four machine learning algorithms were used for classification: Logistic regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees. Classification was performed using only data from the hip accelerometer, using only data from ankle accelerometer and using data from both accelerometers. Results The reported jogging periods were verified by visual inspection and used as golden standard. After the feature selection and tuning of the classification algorithms, all options provided a classification accuracy of at least 0.99, independent of the applied segmentation strategy with sliding windows of either 60s or 180s. The best matching ratio, i.e. the length of correctly identified jogging periods related to the total time including the missed ones, was up to 0.875. It could be additionally improved up to 0.967 by application of post-classification rules, which considered the duration of breaks and jogging periods. There was no obvious benefit of using two accelerometers, rather almost the same performance could be achieved from either accelerometer position. Conclusions Machine learning techniques can be used for automatic activity recognition, as they provide very accurate activity recognition, significantly more accurate than when keeping a diary. Identification of jogging periods in adolescents can be performed using only one accelerometer. Performance-wise there is no significant benefit from using accelerometers on both locations."
https://openalex.org/W2750932872,"The Japanese chestnut (Castanea crenata) carries resistance to Phytophthora cinnamomi, the destructive and widespread oomycete causing ink disease. The European chestnut (Castanea sativa), carrying little to no disease resistance, is currently threatened by the presence of the oomycete pathogen in forests, orchards and nurseries. Determining the genetic basis of P. cinnamomi resistance, for further selection of molecular markers and candidate genes, is a prominent issue for implementation of marker assisted selection in the breeding programs for resistance. In this study, the first interspecific genetic linkage map of C. sativa x C. crenata allowed the detection of QTLs for P. cinnamomi resistance. The genetic map was constructed using two independent, control-cross mapping populations. Chestnut populations were genotyped using 452 microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism molecular markers derived from the available chestnut transcriptomes. The consensus genetic map spans 498,9 cM and contains 217 markers mapped with an average interval of 2.3 cM. For QTL analyses, the progression rate of P. cinnamomi lesions in excised shoots inoculated was used as the phenotypic metric. Using non-parametric and composite interval mapping approaches, two QTLs were identified for ink disease resistance, distributed in two linkage groups: E and K. The presence of QTLs located in linkage group E regarding P. cinnamomi resistance is consistent with a previous preliminary study developed in American x Chinese chestnut populations, suggesting the presence of common P. cinnamomi defense mechanisms across species. Results presented here extend the genomic resources of Castanea genus providing potential tools to assist the ongoing and future chestnut breeding programs."
https://openalex.org/W2751525867,"Mountains are well-suited systems to disentangle the factors driving distribution of parasites due to their heterogeneity of climatic and habitat conditions. However, the information about the relative importance of environmental factors governing the distribution of avian haemosporidians on temperate mountains is very limited. The main goal of the present study is to identify the factors determining prevalence and richness in avian haemosporidians (Plasmodium, Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon) at the community level along elevational gradients on two mountain ranges located around the northern and southern limits of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain). We used samples from 68 avian species and 1,460 breeding individuals caught over widespread woodland and open habitats. Our findings confirmed the importance of climatic variables explaining prevalence and richness on Iberian mountains. However, landscape variables and other factors named host richness and migration behaviour explained more variation than climatic ones. Plasmodium genus preferred open and warm habitats. Water sources were also important for the southern but not for the northern mountain. Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon showed affinities for woodland areas. Climatic conditions for Haemoproteus and Leucocytozoon were dependent on the mountain range suggesting some adaptation of avian haemosporidian and their invertebrate vectors to the climatic particularities of both mountain massifs. In contrast to Plasmodium and Haemoproteus genera, Leucocytozoon prevalence and richness values were significantly higher in the southern mountain range. Overall, our findings at the community level has enriched the relative weight and effect direction of environmental factors governing the distribution and prevalence of the avian haemosporidian community. Also, our results provide a caution message about the precision of predictive models on parasite distributions based on climatic variables, since such predictions could overestimate the effect of climate change scenarios on the transmission of the haemosporidians."

The ankyrin repeat (AR) domain of zDHHC17 (HIP14) and zDHHC13 (HIP14L) S-acyltransferases, which is involved in both substrate recruitment and S-acylation-independent functions, was recently shown to bind at least six proteins, by specific recognition of a consensus sequence in them. To further refine the rules governing binding to the AR of zDHHC17, we employed peptide arrays based on zDHHC AR-binding motif (zDABM) sequences of synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) and cysteine string protein α (CSPα). Quantitative comparisons of the binding preferences of 400 peptides allowed us to construct a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) for zDHHC17 AR binding, with which we predicted and subsequently validated many putative zDHHC17 interactors. We identified 95 human zDABM sequences with unexpected versatility in amino acid usage; these sequences were distributed among 90 proteins, of which 62 have not been previously implicated in zDHHC17/13 binding. These zDABM-containing proteins included all family members of the SNAP25, sprouty, cornifelin, ankyrin, and SLAIN-motif containing families; seven endogenous Gag polyproteins sharing the same binding sequence; and several proteins involved in cytoskeletal organization, cell communication, and regulation of signaling. A dozen of the zDABM-containing proteins had more than one zDABM sequence, whereas isoform-specific binding to the AR of zDHHC17 was identified for the Ena/VASP-like protein. The large number of zDABM sequences within the human proteome suggests that zDHHC17 may be an interaction hub regulating many cellular processes. zDHHC S-acyltransferases are enzymes catalyzing protein S-acylation, a common post-translational modification on proteins frequently affecting their membrane targeting and trafficking.

https://openalex.org/W2751349914,"In recent years, considerable effort has been devoted to the development of a fish model for Parkinson's disease (PD) to examine the pathological mechanisms of neurodegeneration. To effectively evaluate PD pathology, the ability to accurately and reliably count dopaminergic neurons is important. However, there is currently no such standardized method. Due to the relatively small number of dopaminergic neurons in fish, stereological estimation would not be suitable. In addition, serial sectioning requires proficiency to not lose any sections, and it permits double counting due to the large size of some of the dopaminergic neurons. In this study, we report an optimized protocol for staining dopaminergic neurons in zebrafish and provide a reliable counting method. Finally, using our optimized protocol, we confirmed that administration of 6-hydroxydopamine (a neurotoxin) or the deletion of the PINK1 gene (one of the causative genes of familiar PD) in zebrafish caused significant reduction in the number of dopaminergic and noradrenergic neurons. In summary, this method will serve as an important tool for the appropriate evaluation and establishment of fish PD models."
https://openalex.org/W2751342916,"There is interest in pharmacologic preconditioning for end-organ protection by targeting the HIF system. This can be accomplished by inhibition of prolyl 4-hydroxylase (PHD). GSK360A is an orally active PHD inhibitor that has been previously shown to protect the failing heart. We hypothesized that PHD inhibition can also protect the brain from injuries and resulting behavioral deficits that can occur as a result of surgery. Thus, our goal was to investigate the effect of pre-stroke surgery brain protection using a verified GSK360A PHD inhibition paradigm on post-stroke surgery outcomes. Vehicle or an established protective dose (30 mg/kg, p.o.) of GSK360A was administered to male Sprague-Dawley rats. Initially, GSK360A pharmacokinetics and organ distribution were determined, and then PHD-HIF pharmacodynamic markers were measured (i.e., to validate the pharmacological effects of the GSK360A administration regimen). Results obtained using this validated PHD dose-regimen indicated significant improvement by GSK360A (30mg/kg); administered at 18 and 5 hours prior to transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (stroke). GSK360A exposure and plasma, kidney and brain HIF-PHD pharmacodynamics endpoints (e.g., erythropoietin; EPO and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; VEGF) were measured. GSK360A provided rapid exposure in plasma (7734 ng/ml), kidney (45–52% of plasma level) and brain (1–4% of plasma level), and increased kidney EPO mRNA (80-fold) and brain VEGF mRNA (2-fold). We also observed that GSK360A increased plasma EPO (300-fold) and VEGF (2-fold). Further assessments indicated that GSK360A reduced post-stroke surgery neurological deficits (47–64%), cognitive dysfunction (60–75%) and brain infarction (30%) 4 weeks later. Thus, PHD inhibition using GSK360A pretreatment produced long-term post-stroke brain protection and improved behavioral functioning. These data support PHD inhibition, specifically by GSK360A, as a potential strategy for pre-surgical use to reduce brain injury and functional decline due to surgery-related cerebral injury."
https://openalex.org/W2751850629,"The pro-apoptotic BCL2 gene family member, BAX, plays a pivotal role in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Under cellular stress, BAX recruitment to the mitochondria occurs when activated BAX forms dimers, then oligomers, to initiate mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), a process critical for apoptotic progression. The activation and recruitment of BAX to form oligomers has been studied for two decades using fusion proteins with a fluorescent reporter attached in-frame to the BAX N-terminus. We applied high-speed live cell imaging to monitor the recruitment of BAX fusion proteins in dying cells. Data from time-lapse imaging was validated against the activity of endogenous BAX in cells, and analyzed using sigmoid mathematical functions to obtain detail of the kinetic parameters of the recruitment process at individual mitochondrial foci. BAX fusion proteins behave like endogenous BAX during apoptosis. Kinetic studies show that fusion protein recruitment is also minimally affected in cells lacking endogenous BAK or BAX genes, but that the kinetics are moderately, but significantly, different with different fluorescent tags in the fusion constructs. In experiments testing BAX recruitment in 3 different cell lines, our results show that regardless of cell type, once activated, BAX recruitment initiates simultaneously within a cell, but exhibits varying rates of recruitment at individual mitochondrial foci. Very early during BAX recruitment, pro-apoptotic molecules are released in the process of MOMP, but different molecules are released at different times and rates relative to the time of BAX recruitment initiation. These results provide a method for BAX kinetic analysis in living cells and yield greater detail of multiple characteristics of BAX-induced MOMP in living cells that were initially observed in cell free studies."

However, the global native phosphorylation pattern of NaV1.5 subunits associated with these arrhythmogenic disorders and the associated channel regulatory defects remain unknown. Here, we undertook phosphoproteomic analyses to identify and quantify in situ the phosphorylation sites in the NaV1.5 proteins purified from adult WT and failing CaMKIIδc-overexpressing (CaMKIIδc-Tg) mouse ventricles. Of 19 native NaV1.5 phosphorylation sites identified, two C-terminal phosphoserines at positions 1938 and 1989 showed increased phosphorylation in the CaMKIIδc-Tg compared with the WT ventricles. We then tested the hypothesis that phosphorylation at these two sites impairs fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13)-dependent regulation of NaV1.5 channel inactivation. Whole-cell voltage-clamp analyses in HEK293 cells demonstrated that FGF13 increases NaV1.5 channel availability and decreases late Na+ current, two effects that were abrogated with NaV1.5 mutants mimicking phosphorylation at both sites. Additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that FGF13 potentiates the binding of calmodulin to NaV1.5 and that phosphomimetic mutations at both sites decrease the interaction of FGF13 and, consequently, of calmodulin with NaV1.5.

https://openalex.org/W2753086770,"The fast and accurate segmentation of lung nodule image sequences is the basis of subsequent processing and diagnostic analyses. However, previous research investigating nodule segmentation algorithms cannot entirely segment cavitary nodules, and the segmentation of juxta-vascular nodules is inaccurate and inefficient. To solve these problems, we propose a new method for the segmentation of lung nodule image sequences based on superpixels and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN). First, our method uses three-dimensional computed tomography image features of the average intensity projection combined with multi-scale dot enhancement for preprocessing. Hexagonal clustering and morphological optimized sequential linear iterative clustering (HMSLIC) for sequence image oversegmentation is then proposed to obtain superpixel blocks. The adaptive weight coefficient is then constructed to calculate the distance required between superpixels to achieve precise lung nodules positioning and to obtain the subsequent clustering starting block. Moreover, by fitting the distance and detecting the change in slope, an accurate clustering threshold is obtained. Thereafter, a fast DBSCAN superpixel sequence clustering algorithm, which is optimized by the strategy of only clustering the lung nodules and adaptive threshold, is then used to obtain lung nodule mask sequences. Finally, the lung nodule image sequences are obtained. The experimental results show that our method rapidly, completely and accurately segments various types of lung nodule image sequences."
https://openalex.org/W2750631021,"Glycemic variability (GV) is reportedly a predictor for poor outcome in various clinical conditions. We aimed to assess whether GV during hospital admission is associated with poor outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and diabetes. We prospectively enrolled consecutive patients with AIS from the registry of 6 tertiary hospitals between January 2013 and December 2014. For the GV index, we used a glucose level range that was divided into 4 quartiles. Multivariable binary and ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between GV and the modified Rankin Scale score (3–6) at 3 months. We enrolled 1,504 patients with AIS and diabetes (mean age, 68.1 years; male, 57.2%), of which 35.1% had poor outcomes at 3 months. An increasing glucose range quartile was positively associated with initial neurologic severity and development of hypoglycemia during hospital admission. Multivariable analysis showed that the glucose level range quartile was associated with poor outcomes, even after adjusting for the number of glucose measurement and hypoglycemia (odds ratio [OR] Q2 vs. Q1: 1.50, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02–2.18; OR Q3 vs. Q1: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.34–3.01; OR Q4 vs. Q1: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.22–3.23). These associations remained significant after dichotomization according to glycated hemoglobin levels at admission. An increasing glucose level range as a GV index during hospital admission was associated with poor functional outcomes at 3 months in patients with AIS and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2753774840,"Dysregulation of MST1/STK4, a key kinase component of the Hippo-YAP pathway, is linked to the etiology of many cancers with poor prognosis. However, how STK4 restricts the emergence of aggressive cancer remains elusive. Here, we investigated the effects of STK4, primarily localized in the cytoplasm, lipid raft, and nucleus, on cell growth and gene expression in aggressive prostate cancer. We demonstrated that lipid raft and nuclear STK4 had superior suppressive effects on cell growth in vitro and in vivo compared with cytoplasmic STK4. Using RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis, we identified several differentially expressed (DE) genes that responded to ectopic STK4 in all three subcellular compartments. We noted that the number of DE genes observed in lipid raft and nuclear STK4 cells were much greater than cytoplasmic STK4. Our functional annotation clustering showed that these DE genes were commonly associated with oncogenic pathways such as AR, PI3K/AKT, BMP/SMAD, GPCR, WNT, and RAS as well as unique pathways such as JAK/STAT, which emerged only in nuclear STK4 cells. These findings indicate that MST1/STK4/Hippo signaling restricts aggressive tumor cell growth by intersecting with multiple molecular pathways, suggesting that targeting of the STK4/Hippo pathway may have important therapeutic implications for cancer."

While exploring the possibility of using zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) in cholera treatment, we previously found that ZnO NPs reduce fluid accumulation in mouse ileum induced by the cholera toxin (CT) protein. To uncover the mechanism of action of ZnO NPs on CT activity, here we used classical (O395) and El Tor (C6706) V. cholerae biotypes in growth and biochemical assays. We found that a ZnO NP concentration of 10 μg/ml did not affect the growth rates of these two strains, nor did we observe that ZnO NPs reduce the expression levels of CT mRNA and protein. It was observed that ZnO NPs form a complex with CT, appear to disrupt the CT secondary structure, and block its interaction with the GM1 ganglioside receptor in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane in intestinal (HT-29) cells and thereby reduce CT uptake into the cells. In the range of 2.5–10 μg/ml, ZnO NPs exhibited no cytotoxicity on kidney (HEK293) and HT-29 cells. We conclude that ZnO NPs prevent the first step in the translocation of cholera toxin into intestinal epithelial cells without exerting measurable toxic effects on HEK293 and HT-29 cells. Vibrio cholerae causes cholera and is the leading cause of diarrhea in developing countries, highlighting the need for the development of new treatment strategies to combat this disease agent. While exploring the possibility of using zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) in cholera treatment, we previously found that ZnO NPs reduce fluid accumulation in mouse ileum induced by the cholera toxin (CT) protein.

Tetraspanins organize dendritic cell membranes by facilitating protein-protein interactions within the so called tetraspanin web. In this study we analyzed expression of the complete tetraspanin superfamily in primary murine (CD4+, CD8+, pDC) and human DC subsets (CD1c+, CD141+, pDC) at the transcriptome and proteome level. Different RNA and protein expression profiles for the tetraspanin genes across human and murine DC subsets were identified. Although RNA expression levels of CD37 and CD82 were not significantly different between human DC subsets, CD9 RNA was highly expressed in pDCs, while CD9 protein expression was lower. This indicates that relative RNA and protein expression levels are not always in agreement. Both murine CD8α+ DCs and its regarded human counterpart, CD141+ DCs, displayed relatively high protein levels of CD81. CD53 protein was highly expressed on human pDCs in contrast to the relatively low protein expression of most other tetraspanins. This study demonstrates that tetraspanins are differentially expressed by human and murine DC subsets which provides a valuable resource that will aid the understanding of tetraspanin function in DC biology."

Interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) plays an essential role in this pathway by activating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs). Here, we identified optineurin (OPTN) as an IRAK1-binding protein by yeast two-hybrid screening using IRAK1 as bait. A C-terminal fragment of OPTN harboring a ubiquitin-binding domain was co-immunoprecipitated with IRAK1. In reporter analyses, overexpression of OPTN inhibited IL-1β-, IRAK1-, and LPS-induced NF-κB activation. Consistently, OPTN deficiency resulted in increased NF-κB activation in response to IL-1β/LPS stimulation. To address the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of OPTN on NF-κB signaling, we focused on tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which is an adaptor protein of IRAK1 and upon polyubiquitination plays a crucial role during NF-κB activation. Overexpression of OPTN prevented TRAF6 polyubiquitination. Furthermore, OPTN H486R mutant, which is unable to recruit the deubiquitinase CYLD, failed to inhibit IRAK1-induced NF-κB activation. These results suggest that the IRAK1-binding protein OPTN negatively regulates IL-1β/LPS-induced NF-κB activation by preventing polyubiquitination of TRAF6.

Innate immunity is a defense system against viral infection and bacterial invasion. Pathogen-associated molecular patterns from viruses and bacteria are recognized by toll-like receptors (TLRs), critical receptors expressed on innate immune cells (1Akira S. Takeda K.

Barton G.M. MyD88: a central player in innate immune signaling.F1000Prime Rep. 2014; 6: 97Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). IL-1 receptor, which plays a crucial role in inflammatory responses after IL-1β stimulation, also recruits MyD88. When MyD88 is recruited to TLRs or IL-1 receptor via pathogen-associated molecular patterns or IL-1β stimulation, MyD88 in turn recruits IRAK1 and forms a complex with them through their respective death domains (4Loiarro M. Gallo G. Fantò N. De Santis R. Carminati P. Ruggiero V. Sette C. Identification of critical residues of the MyD88 death domain involved in the recruitment of downstream kinases.J. Biol.

After recruitment, IRAK1 is phosphorylated and dissociated from the receptor to interact with tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) (5Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T.

In this study we show that IRAK1 forms a complex with OPTN and that this interaction involves the C terminus (amino acids 425–577) of OPTN. We also show that OPTN negatively regulates IRAK1-dependent and IL-1β-induced NF-κB target gene expression. Further investigation reveals that OPTN prevents polyubiquitination of TRAF6, which is critical for subsequent NF-κB activation. These findings suggest that OPTN is a negative regulator of TLR/IL-1β-MyD88-IRAK1-TRAF6-NF-κB signaling cascades. To identify proteins involved in IRAK1 signaling, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using a human leukocyte cDNA library and obtained 410 positive clones after re-streaking from 7.85 × 106 clones. Subsequent 4 rounds of dropout selection revealed that 11 clones were able to grow on all selection plates. As each of these positive yeast clones may harbor several different plasmids, single plasmids were isolated by using Escherichia coli transformation and re-transfected into yeast cells for another round of two-hybrid screening. Thus, three positive OPTN clones were obtained (Table 1), two of which (#1 and #2) had exactly the same sequence; the third (#3) was 9 bases shorter than the others (supplemental Table 1). In addition to these OPTN clones, we also obtained eight clones containing different genes (Table 1). The OPTN clone #1 along with the eight clones was tested, and we found that only OPTN has the ability to interact with IRAK1 (Fig. 1A).Table 1Identification of putative IRAK1-binding partners by yeast two-hybrid screening with four rounds of dropout selectionGeneGene symbolUniGene numberNumber of clonesOptineurinOPTNHs.3327063Tax1 (human T-cell leukemia virus type I)-binding protein 1TAX1BP1Hs.345761FOS-like antigen 2FOSL2Hs.2209711Tetratricopeptide repeat domain 14TTC14Hs.432131NF-κB-repressing factorNKRFHs.4370841LSM7 homolog, U6 small nuclear RNA-associated (S. cerevisiae)LSM7Hs.5126101Clone 48u-44 immunoglobulin heavy chain variable regionIGHHs.6101371Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit 7ζ, 66/67kDaEIF3S7Hs.556821DnaJ (Hsp40) homolog, subfamily B, member 1DNAJB1Hs.5152101 Open table in a new tab OPTN, a protein composed of 577 amino acids, is known to be a negative regulator of the TNF-α signaling pathway and has a ubiquitin-binding domain in its C-terminal region (amino acids 424–509) (10Nagabhushana A. Bansal M. Swarup G. Optineurin is required for CYLD-dependent inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17477Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All of the three clones of OPTN plasmids contained sequences corresponding to amino acids 425–577, thereby including most of the ubiquitin-binding domain (supplemental Table 1). Therefore, we cloned amino acids 425–577 of OPTN (OPTN425–577) and showed that IRAK1 can form a complex with OPTN through this region alone (Fig. 1B). Next, we performed immunoprecipitation to confirm the IRAK1-OPTN interaction. Significant binding between IRAK1 and OPTN could not be detected under our experimental conditions (Fig. 1C). This is probably because IRAK1 can undergo autophosphorylation, leading to its proteasomal degradation (9Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. The interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase is degraded by proteasomes following its phosphorylation.J. Biol.

IRAK: a kinase associated with the interleukin-1 receptor.Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), Therefore, kinase-dead IRAK1 (IRAK1-KD) (12Ohba T. Ariga Y. Maruyama T. Truong N.K. Inoue J. Muta T.

IRAK1-KD was shown to bind to both full-length OPTN and OPTN425–577 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, we confirmed by immunoprecipitation that TRAF6, an adaptor protein of IRAK1, formed a complex with IRAK1-KD. To detect the TLR/IL-1 receptor signaling, an endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1 (ELAM-1) reporter assay was utilized. The ELAM-1 reporter can be activated in HEK293 cells in an NF-κB-dependent manner in response to TNF-α or IL-1β (12Ohba T. Ariga Y. Maruyama T. Truong N.K. Inoue J. Muta T.

J. 2007; 405: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Overexpression of OPTN prevented ELAM-1 reporter activation in response to TNF-α (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with a previous report that OPTN inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene transcription by TNF-α (14Sudhakar C. Nagabhushana A. Jain N. Swarup G. NF-κB mediates tumor necrosis factor α-induced expression of optineurin, a negative regulator of NF-κB.PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of OPTN also prevented ELAM-1 reporter activation in response to IL-1β stimulation (Fig. 2A). To address the effect of OPTN on TLR signaling, the mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cell line was used as a responder to LPS. Indeed, overexpression of OPTN prevented LPS-induced ELAM-1 reporter activity in RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 2B). IRAK1 transfection in HEK293 cells also activated ELAM-1 reporter activity, which was effectively blocked by OPTN overexpression (Fig. 2C). The CRISPR/CAS9 system was used to establish an OPTN-knock-out (KO) HEK293 cell line. A four-nucleotide deletion in the OPTN-coding sequence led to a premature stop codon in both alleles (Fig. 3, A and B). As expected, OPTN protein expression was completely depleted in the KO HEK293 cells (Fig. 3C). To address the role of OPTN in IL-1β signaling, ELAM-1 reporter assay was performed with KO HEK293 cells. ELAM-1 reporter activity was significantly higher in KO HEK293 cells than in control (WT) HEK293 cells after either IL-1β or TNF-α stimulation (Fig. 3D). In addition, the IRAK1 transfection-induced ELAM-1 reporter activity was also significantly higher in KO HEK293 cells than in WT HEK293 cells (Fig. 3E). As HEK293 cells do not respond to LPS stimulation in the ELAM-1 reporter assay, the role of OPTN in TLR signaling was evaluated with a newly established OPTN-knock-out (KO) RAW264.7 cell line, which has a premature stop codon due to a single nucleotide deletion in the OPTN-coding sequence in both alleles (Fig. 4, A and B). Because it was difficult to detect the OPTN protein expression by Western blotting in RAW264.7 cells under our experimental conditions (data not shown), we performed real time PCR to check the mRNA levels of OPTN. Depletion of OPTN mRNA expression was observed in the KO RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4C), probably due to the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (15Chang Y.F. Imam J.S. Wilkinson M.F. The nonsense-mediated decay RNA surveillance pathway.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (952) Google Scholar). The ELAM-1 reporter assay demonstrated that the LPS-stimulated reporter activity of KO RAW264.7 cells was significantly up-regulated compared with that of WT RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 4D). These results suggested that OPTN is a negative regulator of IRAK1-dependent NF-κB signaling pathways. The IL-1β/LPS-MyD88 axis induces phosphorylation of IRAK1 (16Hu H. Sun S.C. Ubiquitin signaling in immune responses.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 457-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Then, phosphorylated IRAK1 activates TRAF6 through the K63-linked polyubiquitination, which is a prerequisite for NF-κB activation (16Hu H. Sun S.C. Ubiquitin signaling in immune responses.Cell Res. 2016; 26: 457-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of OPTN on TRAF6 polyubiquitination by immunoprecipitation assays. Co-transfection of HA-tagged ubiquitin and FLAG-tagged TRAF6 enabled us to detect TRAF6 polyubiquitination in HEK293T cells (Fig. 5A). Of interest, further transfection of Myc-tagged OPTN significantly decreased the level of TRAF6 polyubiquitination (Fig. 5, A and B). Thus, OPTN seems to negatively regulate NF-κB activation by preventing TRAF6 polyubiquitination. The OPTN H486R mutant loses the binding ability toward the deubiquitinase CYLD and, thus, cannot inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (10Nagabhushana A. Bansal M. Swarup G. Optineurin is required for CYLD-dependent inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17477Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To confirm the involvement of CYLD recruitment in the OPTN-mediated inhibition of IL-1β/LPS-induced NF-κB activation, we performed ELAM-1 reporter assays with the OPTN H486R mutant in HEK293 cells. Consistent with the previous report (10Nagabhushana A. Bansal M. Swarup G. Optineurin is required for CYLD-dependent inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17477Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), the H486R mutation has impaired the suppressive function of OPTN in TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 6A). In addition, the H486R mutant displayed a similar impairment in the prevention of IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 6A). In RAW264.7 cells, the H486R mutant showed a functional defect in the prevention of LPS-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, we found that IRAK1-induced NF-κB activation was significantly inhibited in the presence of OPTN WT but not in the presence of the OPTN H486R mutant (Fig. 6C). Of note, we found that CYLD inhibited ELAM-1 reporter activity in cooperation with OPTN WT; however, it did less well with OPTN H486R mutant (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that OPTN forms a complex with IRAK1 and inhibits the IRAK1/TRAF6-NF-κB axis by preventing TRAF6 polyubiquitination. OPTN negatively regulates TNF-α receptor signaling by localizing in the cytoplasm (17Zhu G. Wu C.J. Zhao Y. Ashwell J.D. Optineurin negatively regulates TNFα-induced NF-κB activation by competing with NEMO for ubiquitinated RIP.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1438-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, OPTN forms a complex with CYLD and polyubiquitinated receptor-interacting protein (RIP). As a member of the deubiquitinating enzyme family, CYLD deubiquitinates RIP and thereby prevents binding of nuclear factor κB essential modulator (NEMO) to RIP (10Nagabhushana A. Bansal M. Swarup G. Optineurin is required for CYLD-dependent inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17477Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), resulting in the inhibition of TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation (17Zhu G. Wu C.J. Zhao Y. Ashwell J.D. Optineurin negatively regulates TNFα-induced NF-κB activation by competing with NEMO for ubiquitinated RIP.Curr. Biol. 2007; 17: 1438-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 18Maruyama H. Morino H. Ito H. Izumi Y. Kato H. Watanabe Y. Kinoshita Y. Kamada M. Nodera H. Suzuki H.

In this study, we reveal that OPTN is a novel binding partner of IRAK1 and prevents the IRAK1-TRAF6-NF-κB signaling axis. It is worth noting that the IRAK1 is involved in IL-1 receptor and TLR signaling, but not in TNF-α receptor signaling (1Akira S. Takeda K. Toll-like receptor signalling.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6666) Google Scholar, 19Brenner D. Blaser H. Mak T.W. Regulation of tumour necrosis factor signalling: live or let die.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2015; 15: 362-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Considering the data of the OPTN H486R mutant that is deficient in the binding to CYLD (10Nagabhushana A. Bansal M. Swarup G. Optineurin is required for CYLD-dependent inhibition of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e17477Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), OPTN is likely to exert an inhibitory effect on IL-1 receptor and TLR signaling by recruiting CYLD to polyubiquitinated molecules. Thus, the potential target molecule(s) of CYLD is likely to be not only associated with IRAK1 but also essential for IL-1 receptor and TLR signaling, similar to RIP in TNF-α receptor signaling. We assumed that the polyubiquitinated TRAF6 exhibits the requirements to be considered as a CYLD target (supplemental Fig. S1). Indeed, our results consistently demonstrate that OPTN reduces the polyubiquitination level of TRAF6, although other molecular mechanisms may also be involved in the OPTN inhibition of the IRAK1-TRAF6-NF-κB signaling axis. OPTN knockdown in a mouse neuroblastoma cell line promoted cell death in response to TNF-α, which was associated with an anomalous increase in NF-κB activity (20Akizuki M. Yamashita H. Uemura K. Maruyama H. Kawakami H. Ito H. Takahashi R. Optineurin suppression causes neuronal cell death via NF-κB pathway.J. Neurochem. 2013; 126: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In humans, OPTN mutations that lack the ability to inhibit NF-κB activity were reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (18Maruyama H. Morino H. Ito H. Izumi Y. Kato H. Watanabe Y. Kinoshita Y. Kamada M. Nodera H. Suzuki H. Komure O. Matsuura S. Kobatake K. Morimoto N.

These reports indicate that aberrant activation of NF-κB can underlie ALS. Here, we propose a novel mechanism for the ALS pathogenesis in which the aberrant NF-κB activation by ALS-related OPTN mutations is partly due to enhanced signaling from IL-1 receptor and TLR (21O'Neill L.A.

Nuclear factor-κB/Rel proteins: a point of convergence of signalling pathways relevant in neuronal function and dysfunction.Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Indeed, the spinal cord of ALS patients contained higher levels of IL-1β (23Li M. Ona V.O. Guégan C. Chen M. Jackson-Lewis V. Andrews L.J. Olszewski A.J. Stieg P.E. Lee J.P. Przedborski S. Friedlander R.M.

Molawi K. Zychlinsky A. Mutant superoxide dismutase 1-induced IL-1β accelerates ALS pathogenesis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13046-13050Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In the case of TLR, high expression of neuronal TLR4 was reported in the spinal cords of ALS patients (25Casula M. Iyer A.M. Spliet W.G. Anink J.J. Steentjes K. Sta M. Troost D. Aronica E. Toll-like receptor signaling in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis spinal cord tissue.Neuroscience. 2011; 179: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). TLR4 was shown to be stimulated by high mobility group box1, which is also extensively present in the spinal cord of ALS patients and regulates neurotoxicity (26Maroso M. Balosso S. Ravizza T. Liu J. Aronica E. Iyer A.M. Rossetti C. Molteni M. Casalgrandi M. Manfredi A.A. Bianchi M.E. Vezzani A. Toll-like receptor 4 and high-mobility group box-1 are involved in ictogenesis and can be targeted to reduce seizures.Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of NF-κB activation by targeting IL-1 receptor and TLR4 signaling via OPTN may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of ALS patients. HEK293T, HEK293, and RAW264.7 cells were cultured in DMEM (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Yeast strain AH109 was obtained from Clontech Laboratories (Mountain View, CA). To delete the Optn gene, RAW264.7 cells were transfected with CRISPR/CAS9 KO plasmid (sc-427990: Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Neon transfection system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). After a couple of days, GFP-positive RAW264.7 cells were sorted by using a cell sorter SH800 (SONY, Tokyo, Japan). Sorted cells were plated on 10-cm dishes at 100–400 cells/dish. Isolated single colonies grown on the plates were picked up manually. OPTN-KO RAW264.7 cell lines were identified by DNA sequencing for the target sites. HEK293 cells were transfected with CRISPR/Cas9 KO plasmid, (PX458: Addgene), which was designed to target the human OPTN gene, using PEI-MAX reagent (Polysciences, Warrington, PA). Single clones were isolated, and KO lines were identified as described above for RAW264.7 cells.

Human IRAK1 was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site in pGBKT7 (Clontech Laboratories). phRLTK-Luc was obtained from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The expression plasmids for full-length OPTN and truncated (amino acids 425–577) OPTN were created by using human cDNA fragments that were amplified by PCR and subcloned into the BamHI/EcoRI site in the pEF6-Myc vector. The H486R mutation was introduced into pEF6-OPTN-Myc by changing the codon CAT into CGT. Yeast AH109 clones were cultured on YPDA-agarose plates (20 g/liter Bacto Peptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, 20 g/liter agar, 0.003% adenine hemisulfate) at 30 °C for 3 days. Then, yeast AH109 colonies were picked and cultured in YPDA broth at 30 °C for 16–20 h. Cultured broth was centrifuged for 5 min at 850 × g at room temperature, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed using TE (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA) solution and then resuspended in TE containing 0.1 m LiAc (pH 7.5) (competent yeast AH109 cell solution). Two-hybrid screening was performed using a human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, pGBKT7-IRAK1, the human leukocyte cDNA library (Clontech Laboratories) preincubated (100 °C for 20 min) salmon testis carrier DNA (Sigma) were mixed at 1:0.5:20 ratio and added to the competent yeast AH109 cell solution and PEG/LiAc solution. After vortexing for 1 min, the mixture was incubated in a shaking water bath (200 rpm, 30 °C) for 30 min, and DMSO was added up to 10% of the solution. The solution was further incubated at 42 °C for 15 min and then on ice for 1 min. The solution of transformed yeast AH109 cells was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 s. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in YPDA broth and spread on synthetically defined (SD) media lacking leucine/tryptophan/histidine + 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) plates (Sigma). After 6–8 days of culture at 30 °C, positive blue colonies were picked and spread on SD/−leucine/−tryptophan/−histidine/−adenine + 25 mm 3-AT plates. The picking and spreading of colonies was then repeated using SD/−leucine/−tryptophan/−histidine + 25 mm 3-AT plates and SD/−leucine/−tryptophan + 25 mm 3-AT plates. Yeast AH109 cells, cultured on SD/−leucine/−tryptophan/−histidine + 25 mm 3-AT broth at 30 °C, were centrifuged. The pellet was then resuspended in TE solution containing 5 units/μl lyticase (Sigma) and incubated in a shaking water bath (230 rpm, 37 °C) for 60 min. After SDS up to 14.3% was added, the solution was subjected to 1 freeze-thaw cycle (from −20 °C to room temperature). Freeze-thaw reagents and other unwanted substances were removed from the solution using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) solution, and plasmids were purified according to the standard ethanol precipitation method (30Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Standard ethanol precipitation of DNA in microcentrifuge tubes.CSH Protoc. 2006; 10.1101/pdb.prot4456Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was carried out as described previously (31Fujimoto T. Yamazaki S. Eto-Kimura A. Takeshige K. Muta T.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47431-47437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression vectors by the calcium phosphate method (32Chen C. Okayama H. High-efficiency transformation of mammalian cells by plasmid DNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). Two days after transfection, cells were washed with PBS, lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm NaF, and 0.2 mm Na3VO4), and incubated on ice for 15 min. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation and then subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG (M2) monoclonal antibody and M2-agarose beads (Sigma). Cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described above. Equal amounts of proteins from the cell lysate samples or the immunoprecipitated samples were subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-c-Myc (9E10, Roche Diagnostics), or anti-HA (3F10, Roche Diagnostics). Anti-OPTN (sc-271549) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence after incubation with Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA). After the Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated samples was performed as described above, the band intensities of HA-tagged ubiquitin and FLAG-tagged TRAF6 were quantitated by densitometry using a C-DiGit blot scanner (LI-COR Biotechnology, Lincoln, NE). To evaluate the levels of TRAF6 polyubiquitination, the intensity ratio of immunoprecipitated ubiquitin to immunoprecipitated TRAF6 was calculated. For normalization, the ratio of pEF6-Myc (vector control) transfection sample was set as 1 in each experiment. To perform transfection with the indicated expression vectors along with the pELAM1-Luc reporter and phRLTK-Luc vectors, HEK293 cells and RAW264.7 cells were transfected with calcium phosphate and Hillymax (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan), respectively. After 48 h of transfection, luciferase activity was measured by the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System according to the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). For cell stimulation, IL-1β, TNF-α, or LPS was used at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, after which cells were incubated for another 5 h. Total RNA was prepared using RNAiso plus (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Japan). mRNA levels were quantified by real time RT-PCR with High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and SYBR Premix EX TaqII (Takara Bio Inc.) using a LightCycler 3302 (Roche Diagnostics). The primer sequences used were as follows: murine OPTN FW, (5′-ATGTCCCATCAACCTCTGAGC-3′) and REV (5′-TCAAATCGCCCTTTCATAGCTTG-3′); murine GAPDH FW (5′-AGAGCTGAACGGGAAG-3′) and REV, (5′-GAAGTCGCAGGAGACA-3′). Student's t test (two-tailed) was used to compare between 2 groups. For more than three groups, one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's test was used to compare among all groups. One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's test was performed to compare with the control group. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01. M. T. designed the research project and performed the experiments. S.

https://openalex.org/W2751016010,"With more than 7,000 new HIV infections daily worldwide, there is an urgent need for non-vaccine biomedical prevention (nBP) strategies that are safe, effective, and acceptable. Clinical trials have demonstrated that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretrovirals (ARVs) can be effective at preventing HIV infection. In contrast, other trials using the same ARVs failed to show consistent efficacy. Topical (vaginal and rectal) dosing is a promising regimen for HIV PrEP as it leads to low systematic drug exposure. A series of titration studies were carried out in bone marrow/liver/thymus (BLT) mice aimed at determining the adequate drug concentrations applied vaginally or rectally that offer protection against rectal or vaginal HIV challenge. The dose-response relationship of these agents was measured and showed that topical tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and emtricitabine (FTC) can offer 100% protection against rectal or vaginal HIV challenges. From the challenge data, EC50 values of 4.6 μM for TDF and 0.6 μM for FTC for HIV vaginal administration and 6.1 μM TDF and 0.18 μM for FTC for rectal administration were obtained. These findings suggest that the BLT mouse model is highly suitable for studying the dose-response relationship in single and combination ARV studies of vaginal or rectal HIV exposure. Application of this sensitive HIV infection model to more complex binary and ternary ARV combinations, particularly where agents have different mechanisms of action, should allow selection of optimal ARV combinations to be advanced into pre-clinical and clinical development as nBP products."
https://openalex.org/W2751885855,"Objectives Hospitalization is potentially detrimental to nursing home patients and resource demanding for the specialist health care. This study assessed if a brief training program in administrating intravenous fluids and antibiotics in nursing homes could reduce hospital transfers and ensure high quality care locally. Design A pragmatic and modified cluster randomized stepped-wedge trial with randomization on nursing home level. Participants 330 cases in 296 nursing home residents from 30 nursing homes were included. Cases were patients provided intravenous antibiotics or intravenous fluids, in nursing home or hospital. Primary outcome was localization of treatment, secondary outcomes were number of days treated, days of hospitalization among admitted patients, type of antibiotics used and 30-day mortality. Intervention The nursing homes sequentially received a one-day educational program for the health workers including theory and practical training in intravenous treatment of dehydration and infection, run by two skilled nurses. After completing the training program, the nursing homes had competence to provide intravenous treatment locally. Results The intervention had a highly significant effect on treatment in nursing homes (OR 8.35, 2.08 to 33.6; P<0.01, or RR 2.23, 1.48 to 2.56). The number treated in nursing homes was stable over time; the number treated in hospital gradually decreased (chi square for trend P< 0.001). Among patients receiving intravenous antibiotics in the nursing homes, 50 (46%) died within 30 days, compared to 30 (36%) treated in the hospital (P = 0.19). Among patients receiving intravenous fluids locally, 21 (19%) died within 30 days, compared to 2 (8%) in the hospital group (P = 0.34). Mortality was associated with reduced consciousness and elevated c-reactive protein. Conclusions A brief educational program delivered to nursing home personnel was feasible and effective in reducing acute hospital admissions from nursing homes for treatment of dehydration and infections."
https://openalex.org/W2753531018,"Low muscle power, particularly at high velocities, has been linked to poor physical function in older adults. Any loss in muscle power following fatiguing exercise or daily activities could impact physical function and postural control until power has fully recovered. To test the overall hypothesis that a common task such as walking can result in prolonged power loss and decreased physical function and balance, 17 healthy older (66-81 years) women completed a 32-min walking test (32MWT) designed to induce neuromuscular fatigue, followed by 60min of recovery (60R). Fatigue and recovery of knee extensor muscle power (3 velocities) were quantified by dynamometry. Function was quantified by chair rise time and postural control by measures of center of pressure (COP) range (mm) and velocity (mm·s-1) during quiet stance. Power declined at all velocities by 8-13% 2min following the 32MWT (p≤0.02) and remained depressed by 8-26% at 60R (p≤0.04). Postural control decreased following the 32MWT, indicated by increased COP range in the anterior-posterior (AP, p<0.01) direction and a trend in the medial-lateral (ML) direction (p = 0.09), and returned to baseline by 60R (p≥0.10). COP velocity was unchanged immediately following the 32MWT, but at 60R was lower in ML (p = 0.03) and tended to be reduced in AP (p = 0.07). Changes in high-velocity power (270°·s-1) were associated with altered postural control (p = 0.02) and chair rise performance (p≤0.03). These results provide evidence of long-duration neuromuscular changes following fatigue in healthy older women that may place them at increased risk for functional deficits during everyday mobility tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2753851240,"The agent responsible for prion diseases is a misfolded form of a normal protein (PrPC). The prion hypothesis stipulates that PrPC must be present for the disease to manifest. Cervid populations across the world are infected with chronic wasting disease, a horizontally-transmissible prion disease that is likely spread via oral exposure to infectious prions (PrPCWD). Though PrPCWD has been identified in many tissues, there has been little effort to characterize the overall PrPC expression in cervids and its relationship to PrPCWD accumulation. We used immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to describe PrPC expression in naive white-tailed deer. We used real-time, quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) to detect prion seeding activity in CWD-infected deer. We assessed tissues comprising the alimentary tract, alimentary-associated lymphoid tissue and systemic lymphoid tissue from 5 naive deer. PrPC was expressed in all tissues, though expression was often very low compared to the level in the CNS. IHC identified specific cell types wherein PrPC expression is very high. To compare the distribution of PrPC to PrPCWD, we examined 5 deer with advanced CWD infection. Using RT-QuIC, we detected prion seeding activity in all 21 tissues. In 3 subclinical deer sacrificed 4 months post-inoculation, we detected PrPCWD consistently in alimentary-associated lymphoid tissue, irregularly in alimentary tract tissues, and not at all in the brain. Contrary to our hypothesis that PrPC levels dictate prion accumulation, PrPC expression was higher in the lower gastrointestinal tissues than in the alimentary-associated lymphoid system and was higher in salivary glands than in the oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue. These data suggest that PrPC expression is not the sole driver of prion accumulation and that alimentary tract tissues accumulate prions before centrifugal spread from the brain occurs."

This study evaluated HIV prevalence in pregnant women of Liangshan Prefecture using HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) data over the period of 2009 to 2015. Methods Xichang, Zhaojue County, and Butuo County were selected as HSS sites. We investigated the temporal trends in HIV prevalence in these areas, and the association between demographic and behavioral characteristics and risk of HIV infection. Results Data on a total of 2797 pregnant women in Xichang and 3983 pregnant women in Zhaojue and Butuo was collected for the period 2009 to 2015. There was a fluctuating HIV prevalence among pregnant women of Xichang, with a rate of 0.75% in 2015 (χ2trend = 2.27, P = 0.13). HIV prevalence among pregnant women of Zhaojue and Butuo was consistently high, varying between 3.4% (9/267, 2011) and 10.3% (82/796, 2012) over the period of 2010 to 2015 (χ2trend = 0.12, P = 0.73). In Xichang, we found that Yi ethnicity (OR = 11.37, 95% CI = 2.92–44.25) and a husband who used drugs (OR = 32.13, 95% CI = 5.33–193.67) were significantly associated with HIV risk in pregnant women. For Zhaojue and Butuo, we observed that pregnant women had a higher risk of HIV infection when they were over 30 years old (OR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.17–2.52), when they had a higher number of previous births, when their husbands had a history of migrating for work (OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.16–2.08), and when they had a history of other sexually transmitted infections (OR = 2.19, 95% CI = 1.16–2.08). Compared to those with a primary school education or below, pregnant women with a secondary or high school education level had a lower risk of HIV infection (OR = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.09–0.89). Conclusion Our results indicate that there is a serious HIV epidemic among pregnant Yi women, especially for those with less education, more past births, or a husband with a history of out-migrating for work or STD infection."
https://openalex.org/W2752832878,"Most of our understanding of forebrain development comes from research of eutherian mammals, such as rodents, primates, and carnivores. However, as the cerebral cortex forms largely prenatally, observation and manipulation of its development has required invasive and/or ex vivo procedures. Marsupials, on the other hand, are born at comparatively earlier stages of development and most events of forebrain formation occur once attached to the teat, thereby permitting continuous and non-invasive experimental access. Here, we take advantage of this aspect of marsupial biology to establish and characterise a resourceful laboratory model of forebrain development: the fat-tailed dunnart (Sminthopsis crassicaudata), a mouse-sized carnivorous Australian marsupial. We present an anatomical description of the postnatal development of the body, head and brain in dunnarts, and provide a staging system compatible with human and mouse developmental stages. As compared to eutherians, the orofacial region develops earlier in dunnarts, while forebrain development is largely protracted, extending for more than 40 days versus ca. 15 days in mice. We discuss the benefits of fat-tailed dunnarts as laboratory animals in studies of developmental biology, with an emphasis on how their accessibility in the pouch can help address new experimental questions, especially regarding mechanisms of brain development and evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2750777289,"Increasing litter size is of great interest to the pig industry. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression, resulting in livestock phenotypes such as disease resistance, milk production, and reproduction. We classified Berkshire pigs into two groups according to litter size and estimated breeding value: smaller (SLG) and larger (LLG) litter size groups. Genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression were analyzed using placenta genomic DNA and RNA to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with litter size. The methylation levels of CpG dinucleotides in different genomic regions were noticeably different between the groups, while global methylation pattern was similar, and excluding intergenic regions they were found the most frequently in gene body regions. Next, we analyzed RNA-Seq data to identify DEGs between the SLG and LLG groups. A total of 1591 DEGs were identified: 567 were downregulated and 1024 were upregulated in LLG compared to SLG. To identify genes that simultaneously exhibited changes in DNA methylation and mRNA expression, we integrated and analyzed the data from bisulfite-Seq and RNA-Seq. Nine DEGs positioned in DMRs were found. The expression of only three of these genes (PRKG2, CLCA4, and PCK1) was verified by RT-qPCR. Furthermore, we observed the same methylation patterns in blood samples as in the placental tissues by PCR-based methylation analysis. Together, these results provide useful data regarding potential epigenetic markers for selecting hyperprolific sows."
https://openalex.org/W2750886524,"Myosin-5B is a ubiquitous molecular motor that transports cargo vesicles of the endomembrane system in intracellular recycling pathways. Myosin-5B malfunction causes the congenital enteropathy microvillus inclusion disease, underlining its importance in cellular homeostasis. Here we describe the interaction of myosin-5B with F-actin, nucleotides, and the pyrazolopyrimidine compound myoVin-1. We show that single-headed myosin-5B is an intermediate duty ratio motor with a kinetic ATPase cycle that is rate-limited by the release of phosphate. The presence of a second head generates strain and gating in the myosin-5B dimer that alters the kinetic signature by reducing the actin-activated ADP release rate to become rate-limiting. This kinetic transition into a high-duty ratio motor is a prerequisite for the proposed transport function of myosin-5B in cellular recycling pathways. Moreover, we show that the small molecule compound myoVin-1 inhibits the enzymatic and functional activity of myosin-5B in vitro Partial inhibition of the actin-activated steady-state ATPase activity and sliding velocity suggests that caution should be used when probing the effect of myoVin-1 on myosin-5-dependent transport processes in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2751152665,"Alterations in microRNA (miRNA) expression may contribute to COPD pathogenesis. In COPD, lung fibroblast repair functions are altered in multiple ways, including extracellular mediator release. Our prior study revealed miR-503 expression is decreased in COPD lung fibroblasts, although the exact role played by miR-503 is undetermined. The current study examined a role of miR-503 in cytokine, growth factor and fibronectin production by lung fibroblasts from patients with and without COPD. Primary adult lung fibroblasts were isolated from patients with or without COPD. MiR-503 expression and interleukin (IL)-6, -8, PGE2, HGF, KGF, VEGF and fibronectin release were examined with or without inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. MiR-503 expression was decreased in COPD lung fibroblasts. The expression of miR-503 was positively correlated with %FVC, %FEV1, and %DLco as well as IL-6, -8, PGE2, HGF, KGF, and VEGF in the absence or presence of IL-1ß/TNF-α. In addition, IL-8 and VEGF release from COPD lung fibroblasts were increased compared to those from control. Exogenous miR-503 inhibited VEGF release from primary adult and fetal lung fibroblasts but not IL-8 release. As expected, COPD fibroblasts proliferated more slowly than control fibroblasts. MiR-503 did not affect proliferation of either control or COPD lung fibroblasts. MiR-503 inhibition of VEGF protein production and mRNA was mediated by direct binding to the 3' untranslated region of VEGF mRNA. Endogenous miR-503 was differently regulated by exogenous stimulants associated with COPD pathogenesis, including IL-1ß/TNF-α, TGF-ß1 and PGE2. Endogenous miR-503 inhibition augmented VEGF release by IL-1ß/TNF-α and TGF-ß1 but not by PGE2, demonstrating selectivity of miR-503 regulation of VEGF. In conclusions, reduced miR-503 augments VEGF release from lung fibroblasts from patients with COPD. Since VEGF contributes to disturbed vasculature in COPD, altered miR-503 production might play a role in modulating fibroblast-mediated vascular homeostasis in COPD."
https://openalex.org/W2752164686,"T-cell lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1 (Tiam1) is a Dbl-family guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that specifically activates the Rho-family GTPase Rac1 in response to upstream signals, thereby regulating cellular processes including cell adhesion and migration. Tiam1 contains multiple domains, including an N-terminal pleckstrin homology coiled-coiled extension (PHn-CC-Ex) and catalytic Dbl homology and C-terminal pleckstrin homology (DH-PHc) domain. Previous studies indicate that larger fragments of Tiam1, such as the region encompassing the N-terminal to C-terminal pleckstrin homology domains (PHn-PHc), are auto-inhibited. However, the domains in this region responsible for inhibition remain unknown. Here, we show that the PHn-CC-Ex domain inhibits Tiam1 GEF activity by directly interacting with the catalytic DH-PHc domain, preventing Rac1 binding and activation. Enzyme kinetics experiments suggested that Tiam1 is auto-inhibited through occlusion of the catalytic site rather than by allostery. Small angle X-ray scattering and ensemble modeling yielded models of the PHn-PHc fragment that indicate it is in equilibrium between “open” and “closed” conformational states. Finally, single-molecule experiments support a model in which conformational sampling between the open and closed states of Tiam1 contributes to Rac1 dissociation.

https://openalex.org/W2753449297,"The North Pacific Ocean (between approximately 0°N and 50°N) contains the largest continuous ecosystem on Earth. This region plays a vital role in the cycling of globally important nutrients as well as carbon. Although the microbial communities in this region have been assessed, the dynamics of viruses (abundances and production rates) remains understudied. To address this gap, scientific cruises during the winter and summer seasons (2013) covered the North Pacific basin to determine factors that may drive virus abundances and production rates. Along with information on virus particle abundance and production, we collected a spectrum of oceanographic metrics as well as information on microbial diversity. The data suggest that both biotic and abiotic factors affect the distribution of virus particles. Factors influencing virus dynamics did not vary greatly between seasons, although the abundance of viruses was almost an order of magnitude greater in the summer. When considered in the context of microbial community structure, our observations suggest that members of the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Bacteroidetes were correlated to both virus abundances and virus production rates: these phyla have been shown to be enriched in particle associated communities. The findings suggest that environmental factors influence virus community functions (e.g., virion particle degradation) and that particle-associated communities may be important drivers of virus activity."
https://openalex.org/W2751714326,"G-proteins regulate various processes ranging from DNA replication and protein synthesis to cytoskeletal dynamics and cofactor assimilation and serve as models for uncovering strategies deployed for allosteric signal transduction. MeaB is a multifunctional G-protein chaperone, which gates loading of the active 5′-deoxyadenosylcobalamin cofactor onto methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) and precludes loading of inactive cofactor forms. MeaB also safeguards MCM, which uses radical chemistry, against inactivation and rescues MCM inactivated during catalytic turnover by using the GTP-binding energy to offload inactive cofactor. The conserved switch I and II signaling motifs used by G-proteins are predicted to mediate allosteric regulation in response to nucleotide binding and hydrolysis in MeaB. Herein, we targeted conserved residues in the MeaB switch I motif to interrogate the function of this loop. Unexpectedly, the switch I mutations had only modest effects on GTP binding and on GTPase activity and did not perturb stability of the MCM–MeaB complex. However, these mutations disrupted multiple MeaB chaperone functions, including cofactor editing, loading, and offloading. Hence, although residues in the switch I motif are not essential for catalysis, they are important for allosteric regulation. Furthermore, single-particle EM analysis revealed, for the first time, the overall architecture of the MCM–MeaB complex, which exhibits a 2:1 stoichiometry. These EM studies also demonstrate that the complex exhibits considerable conformational flexibility.

In conclusion, the switch I element does not significantly stabilize the MCM–MeaB complex or influence the affinity of MeaB for GTP but is required for transducing signals between MeaB and MCM. MeaB from Methylobacterium extorquens is a member of the G3E group of SIMIBI P-loop G-proteins, which include several metallochaperones (1Leipe D.D. Wolf Y.I. Koonin E.V. Aravind L.

Once loaded with AdoCbl, MCM catalyzes the radical-based isomerization of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. Inadvertent dissociation of the 5′-deoxyadenosine moiety from the active site precludes reformation of AdoCbl at the end of the catalytic cycle and results in inactivation of MCM (3Padovani D.

MeaB plays additional roles following cofactor loading. It protects MCM from inactivation, slowing escape from the turnover cycle ∼30-fold (2Padovani D. Banerjee R.

MeaB exists as a homodimer and binds MCM with high affinity (KD = 34–525 nm), which varies depending on the presence or absence and the identity of the ligands bound to the two proteins (4Padovani D.

In contrast, the metallochaperones CooC and HypB, which catalyze the insertion of nickel into carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and [Ni-Fe]-hydrogenase, respectively, undergo NTP-dependent dimerization (22Gasper R.

Like most G-proteins, MeaB exhibits low intrinsic GTPase activity (4Padovani D. Labunska T. Banerjee R.

Chem. 2006; 281: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In complex with MCM, the GTPase activity of MeaB is enhanced ∼100-fold. Hence, MCM functions as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for MeaB (4Padovani D. Labunska T. Banerjee R. Energetics of interaction between the G-protein chaperone, MeaB and B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 17838-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Like other G-proteins, MeaB contains the signature switch I/II elements (Fig. 2A), which are important for catalysis and signaling to downstream effector proteins (25Wittinghofer A. Vetter I.R. Structure-function relationships of the G domain, a canonical switch motif.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 943-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Residues in the switch I/II motifs provide some of the ligands to the Mg2+ ion and undergo conformational rearrangements in response to nucleotide binding, exchange, and hydrolysis. In the so-called “loaded spring” mechanism, direct H2O-mediated or Mg2+-mediated contacts form between the switch motif residues and the γ-phosphate of GTP and are disrupted upon hydrolysis (26Vetter I.R. Wittinghofer A. The guanine nucleotide-binding switch in three dimensions.Science. 2001; 294: 1299-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar). Besides the switch I/II elements, MeaB and its homologs have an additional mobile loop called switch III (residues 178–188), which is distant from the GTP-binding site (Fig. 2A). Switch III has been captured crystallographically in multiple conformations (17Lofgren M. Padovani D. Koutmos M. Banerjee R. A switch III motif relays signaling between a B12 enzyme and its G-protein chaperone.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutations localizing in the switch III loop have been identified in methylmalonic aciduria patients (27Dempsey-Nunez L. Illson M.L. Kent J. Huang Q. Brebner A. Watkins D. Gilfix B.M. Wittwer C.T. Rosenblatt D.S. High resolution melting analysis of the MMAA gene in patients with cblA and in those with undiagnosed methylmalonic aciduria.Mol. Genet. Metab. 2012; 107: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and compromise the fidelity of AdoCbl loading/offloading processes and alleviate the protective effect on MCM during turnover, making it more susceptible to inactivation (17Lofgren M.

GTP hydrolysis triggers conformational changes in the switch I/II loops that are propagated to switch III via switch II (17Lofgren M. Padovani D. Koutmos M. Banerjee R. A switch III motif relays signaling between a B12 enzyme and its G-protein chaperone.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2013; 9: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The switch II element (residues 154–162) plays an additional role in suppressing the intrinsic GTPase activity of MeaB (28Lofgren M. Koutmos M. Banerjee R. Autoinhibition and signaling by the switch II motif in the G-protein chaperone of a radical B12 enzyme.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 30980-30989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Val156 and Val158 in switch II are postulated to impede access of the water-activating general base (Asp92 as discussed below). Glu154 in switch II interacts with Arg108 in switch I (Fig. 2B), and its mutation to alanine increases the intrinsic GTPase activity 10-fold and renders MeaB insensitive to GAP activation in the presence of MCM. The role of the switch I sequence (residues 92–108) in the chaperone function of MeaB is not known. The switch I sequence, D92,D105KTR108, is not strongly conserved and resides on an extended loop (Fig. 2B). An identical D180,D193KTR196 sequence is found in the human homolog, CblA (Fig. 2C). The crystal structures of both MeaB and CblA indicate that they do not represent catalytically active conformations. Despite the presence of nucleotides in some MeaB structures, Mg2+ is absent from all of them, and the switch I residue Asp92, which is predicted to activate the nucleophilic water for attack on the γ-phosphorus, is displaced 11–14 Å from the active site (17Lofgren M.

We have postulated that the active site of MeaB is brought into catalytic register in the MCM–MeaB complex either via donation of critical residues from MCM and/or via a conformational rearrangement of residues in the MeaB active site (28Lofgren M.

Interestingly, most of the switch I residues are not resolved in the CblA structure (Fig. 2C), although Asp180 (corresponding to Asp92 in MeaB) also appears to be blocked from the active site by a bulky hydrophobic residue (Val244) in this inactive conformation (19Froese D.S.

The structure of IcmF with AdoCbl shows two Mg2+ ions and a GDP bound in each G-domain (Fig. 2D). Asp249 in IcmF (corresponding to Asp92 in MeaB), hydrogen bonds to a water molecule while Asp262 (equivalent to MeaB Asp105) coordinates a second Mg2+ and Arg265 (MeaB Arg108) hydrogen bonds to an oxygen atom on the α-phosphate group. Interestingly, IcmF lacks a bulky, hydrophobic residue, which would restrict access of the catalytic Asp249 residue to the nucleophilic water and exhibits higher intrinsic GTPase activity (32Cracan V.

Surprisingly, our data reveal that switch I residues do not play essential roles in GTP hydrolysis but, like the previously characterized switch II and III loops, play a critical role in gating the transfer of AdoCbl from ATR to MCM and in evicting inactive cob(II)alamin from the MCM active site. Furthermore, our single-particle EM studies provide the first structural insights into the organization of a stand-alone mutase, MCM, in complex with its G-protein chaperone and reveal a 2:1 stoichiometry in a conformationally dynamic MCM–MeaB complex. We used isothermal titration calorimetry to determine the KD values for GDP binding to MeaB, which is a homodimeric protein. MeaB exhibited negative cooperativity for nucleotide binding with the affinity at site 1 (KD = 0.20 ± 0.01 μm) being ∼10-fold stronger than for site 2 (KD of 2.1 ± 0.2 μm) (Table 1). All switch I mutants similarly exhibited negative cooperativity for GDP binding. Perturbations in the binding affinities for site 1 were relatively modest with KD values ranging from 0.07 ± 0.02 μm for D105A MeaB to 1.3 ± 0.6 μm for K106A MeaB. Perturbations at site 2 followed the same pattern with the D105A mutant showing the highest affinity for GDP (KD = 0.8 ± 0.2 μm) and the K106A mutant showing the weakest affinity (KD = 7.2 ± 1.9 μm). Unfortunately, the R108M mutant could not be characterized due to its insolubility. Importantly, the binding isotherms for the switch I mutants were similar to that of wild-type MeaB (supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting that the mutations do not significantly affect nucleotide binding.Table 1Dissociation constants for GDP binding to MeaB switch I mutantsMeaBKDSite 1Site 2μmWild type0.2 ± 0.012.1 ± 0.2D92A0.6 ± 0.24.6 ± 1.4D92N0.4 ± 0.13.5 ± 0.9D105A0.07 ± 0.020.8 ± 0.2K106A1.3 ± 0.67.2 ± 1.9R108MNDND Open table in a new tab Modest changes in the intrinsic GTPase activity were observed with all the mutants compared with wild-type MeaB (Table 2).

The magnitude of GAP activation for the D105A and D92N mutants was dampened by their higher intrinsic GTPase activity.Table 2Kinetic parameters for GTP hydrolysis by switch I mutations in MeaBEnzymekcat-Fold GAP activation−MCM+MCMmin−1Wild typeaDetermined previously (2).0.039 ± 0.0034.1 ± 0.20105D92A0.044 ± 0.0060.87 ± 0.3320D92N0.12 ± 0.041.95 ± 0.4616D105A0.16 ± 0.043.7 ± 0.323K106A0.07 ± 0.02.6 ± 0.237a Determined previously (2Padovani D.

Open table in a new tab Inactivation of MCM during catalysis results in the formation of OH2Cbl, which can be distinguished from the active AdoCbl cofactor by its absorption peak at 351 nm (3Padovani D. Banerjee R. A G-protein editor gates coenzyme B12 loading and is corrupted in methylmalonic aciduria.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 21567-21572Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MCM is inactivated to a similar extent in the presence or absence of MeaB (Fig. 3A, B, and D). However, in the presence of GMPPNP, MeaB affords some protection to MCM against inactivation (Fig. 3, C and D). The switch I mutants D92A, D92N, D105A, and K106A also protect MCM from inactivation (Fig. 3D). Hence, the switch I loop does not appear to be important in the allosteric protection of MCM against inactivation during turnover. Two nucleotide-dependent switches, ATP binding to ATR and GTP hydrolysis by MeaB, trigger AdoCbl transfer from ATR to the MCM–MeaB complex (Fig. 1) (15Padovani D. Labunska T. Palfey B.A. Ballou D.P. Banerjee R. Adenosyltransferase tailors and delivers coenzyme B12.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 194-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 16Padovani D. Banerjee R. A rotary mechanism for coenzyme B12 synthesis by adenosyltransferase.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 5350-5357Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). GTP hydrolysis by MeaB is essential for cofactor transfer, and in the presence of GMPPNP, ∼0.06 eq of AdoCbl is transferred to MCM–MeaB, whereas the rest is released into solution (Fig. 3E). Mutations in the switch I element uncouple GTP hydrolysis from AdoCbl transfer. Thus, in the presence of GMPPNP, ∼0.4 eq of AdoCbl is transferred from ATR to the MCM–MeaB complex containing the D92N or K106A mutant with the rest of the cofactor appearing in solution. An even greater fraction of AdoCbl transfer (∼0.8 eq) is seen in the presence of the D92A or D105A mutant of MeaB. Hence, the switch I loop is important for interprotein signaling during GTPase-gated AdoCbl transfer from ATR to the MCM–MeaB complex. Accumulation of cob(II)alamin in the active site of MCM from which the 5′-deoxyadenosine moiety has been lost triggers the repair function of MeaB (3Padovani D. Banerjee R.

This rescue function of MeaB specifically evicts cob(II)alamin but not the oxidized product, OH2Cbl. Addition of GMPPNP to the wild-type cob(II)alamin-containing MCM–MeaB complex under anaerobic conditions triggers ejection of ∼97% of the cofactor (Fig. 3F). The released cofactor can be quantified as OH2Cbl (at 351 nm) following separation from the protein using a Centricon filter under aerobic conditions. Addition of GMPPNP to the MCM–MeaB complex loaded with cob(II)alamin and MeaB harboring switch I mutations led to ejection of 51–66% of the cofactor (Fig. 3F). Hence, the switch I mutations impair GTP-dependent displacement of cob(II)alamin from MCM. The stoichiometry of the MCM–MeaB complex was estimated by size exclusion chromatography coupled to multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS). In the presence of GMPPNP, the wild-type complex elutes as a single monodisperse species that has an average molecular mass of ∼359 kDa (Fig. 4A). This matches a 2:1 stoichiometry for MCM:MeaB, which has a predicted molecular mass of 352 kDa (MCM, 142 kDa per αβ heterodimer; MeaB, 71 kDa per α2 homodimer). The SEC-MALS chromatograms for complexes containing switch I MeaB mutants were identical to the wild-type complex. Hence, the mutations in the switch I loop do not cause significant perturbations in the gross architecture or stability of the MCM–MeaB complex. Therefore, perturbations in allosteric communication between MeaB and MCM, which impair its chaperone functions, are not due to destabilization of the complex. Next, we analyzed the MCM–MeaB complex by negative-stain EM (Fig. 4B). Reference-free 2D class averages showed three distinct globular densities that appear flexibly connected. The outside densities are elongated and larger than the central density, indicating th"

We examine potential pathways through which experiences may either support or undermine the legitimacy of the police, and thus cooperation and compliance with them. We find evidence that perceptions of the police as having goals that align with those of wider society, and as being fair in general, mediate relations between the quality of encounters and legitimacy, which in turn mediates the relation with cooperation and compliance. Identification with wider society was not a reliable mediator, contrary to our predictions based on the Group Engagement Model. Moreover, our analysis of the structure of police fairness perceptions finds no support for the distinction between procedural and distributive police fairness as usually conceived. Implications for the social psychological understanding of legitimate authority are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2750744146,"The management of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) depends on their clinical stage. Thus, noninvasive early recognition of patients with CHC at high risk for developing liver-related events (LREs) is important because it ensures optimal preventative management strategies may be employed that can affect the course of CHC disease. Our aim was to determine whether liver stiffness measurement (LSM) in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients is associated with a risk of LREs, particularly in cirrhotic patients. We carried out a retrospective study on 343 HCV-infected patients stratified according to cirrhosis (LSM<12.5 kPa vs. LSM≥12.5 kPa), and the cirrhotic patient group (LSM≥12.5 kPa) was divided according to risk of esophageal varices (LSM <25 kPa vs. LSM≥25 kPa). For all patients, each incremental unit in the natural logarithm (Ln) of LSM was associated with 14.76 times higher risk of developing LREs (p<0.001). Patients with cirrhosis (LSM≥12.5 kPa) had a higher risk of LREs than patients without cirrhosis (LSM<12.5 kPa) [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 30.97; p<0.001]. When only cirrhotic patients were analyzed (n = 60), each incremental unit in the Ln of LSM was associated with 10.56 times higher risk of developing LREs (p = 0.010). Patients with LSM≥25 kPa had a greater risk for LRE development compared to those with LSM<25 kPa (aHR = 3.65; p = 0.045). The AUROC for predicting the onset of LREs was 0.876 in all patients and 0.729 in cirrhotic patients. In conclusion, LSM was associated with an increased risk of developing LREs in HCV-infected patients, even within the group of cirrhotic patients."
https://openalex.org/W2753229021,"The Rho ADP-ribosylating C3 exoenzyme (C3bot) is a bacterial protein toxin devoid of a cell-binding or -translocation domain. Nevertheless, C3 can efficiently enter intact cells, including neurons, but the mechanism of C3 binding and uptake is not yet understood. Previously, we identified the intermediate filament vimentin as an extracellular membranous interaction partner of C3. However, uptake of C3 into cells still occurs (although reduced) in the absence of vimentin, indicating involvement of an additional host cell receptor. C3 harbors an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) motif, which is the major integrin-binding site, present in a variety of integrin ligands. To check whether the RGD motif of C3 is involved in binding to cells, we performed a competition assay with C3 and RGD peptide or with a monoclonal antibody binding to β1-integrin subunit and binding assays in different cell lines, primary neurons, and synaptosomes with C3-RGD mutants. Here, we report that preincubation of cells with the GRGDNP peptide strongly reduced C3 binding to cells. Moreover, mutation of the RGD motif reduced C3 binding to intact cells and also to recombinant vimentin. Anti-integrin antibodies also lowered the C3 binding to cells. Our results indicate that the RGD motif of C3 is at least one essential C3 motif for binding to host cells and that integrin is an additional receptor for C3 besides vimentin."

This article describes the uPROPHET database construction, follow-up strategies and baseline characteristics of the HTx patients. Methods HTx patients enrolled at the University Hospital Gasthuisberg (Leuven) collected mid-morning urine samples. Cardiac biopsies were obtained at HTx. UP and TP methods and the statistical work flow in pursuit of the research objectives are described in detail in the Data supplement. Results Of 352 participants in the UP study (24.4% women), 38.9%, 40.3%, 5.7% and 15.1% had ischemic, dilated, hypertrophic or other cardiomyopathy. The median interval between HTx and first UP assessment (baseline) was 7.8 years. At baseline, mean values were 56.5 years for age, 25.2 kg/m2 for body mass index, 142.3/84.8 mm Hg and 124.2/79.8 mm Hg for office and 24-h ambulatory systolic/diastolic pressure, and 58.6 mL/min/1.73 m2 for the estimated glomerular filtration rate. Of all patients, 37.2% and 6.5% had a history of mild (grade = 1B) or severe (grade ≥ 2) cellular rejection. Anti-body mediated rejection had occurred in 6.2% patients. The number of follow-up urine samples available for future analyses totals over 950. The TP study currently includes biopsies from 7 healthy donors and 15, 14, and 3 patients with ischemic, dilated, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Conclusions uPROPHET constitutes a solid resources for UP and TP research in the field of HTx and has the ambition to lay the foundation for the clinical application of UP in risk stratification in HTx patients."
https://openalex.org/W2751572706,"An endoparasitic monogenean was identified for the first time from Indonesia. The oesophagus and anterior stomach of the croakers Nibea soldado (Lacépède) and Otolithes ruber (Bloch & Schneider) (n = 35 each) sampled from the South Java coast in May 2011 and Johnius amblycephalus (Bleeker) (n = 2) (all Sciaenidae) from Kedonganan fish market, South Bali coast, in November 2016, were infected with Pseudempleurosoma haywardi sp. nov. Prevalences in the first two croakers were 63% and 46%, respectively, and the two J. amblycephalus harboured three and five individuals. All three croakers represent new hosts for this monogenean genus. We provide infection rates, light microscopical observations, 3D confocal microscopical illustrations, and a morphometric comparison with all congeners. The new species differs in body size, the position and shape of the ovary and testes, and especially in the composition of the dorsal anchor complex, with the dorsal bar being anteriorly concave rather than planar or convex as in its congeners. The dorsal and ventral anchors of this new species are the longest in the genus, whereas the male copulatory organ is the smallest. The first DNA sequences for a member of this genus demonstrate the greatest similarity with endoparasitic freshwater monogeneans from African cichlid fishes. This suggests a freshwater origin for these marine endoparasitic monogeneans."
https://openalex.org/W2752221441,"Bacterial strains of the same species collected from different hosts frequently exhibit differences in gene content. In the ubiquitous plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, more than 30% of genes encoded by each strain are not conserved among strains colonizing other host species. Although they are often implicated in host specificity, the role of this large fraction of the genome in host-specific adaptation is largely unexplored. Here, we sought to relate variation in gene content between strains infecting different species to variation that persists between strains on the same host. We fully sequenced a collection of P. syringae strains collected from wild Arabidopsis thaliana populations in the Midwestern United States. We then compared patterns of variation observed in gene content within these A. thaliana-isolated strains to previously published P. syringae sequence from strains collected on a diversity of crop species. We find that strains collected from the same host, A. thaliana, differ in gene content by 21%, 2/3 the level of gene content variation observed across strains collected from different hosts. Furthermore, the frequency with which specific genes are present among strains collected within the same host and among strains collected from different hosts is highly correlated. This implies that most gene content variation is maintained irrespective of host association. At the same time, we identify specific genes whose presence is important for P. syringae's ability to flourish within A. thaliana. Specifically, the A. thaliana strains uniquely share a genomic island encoding toxins active against plants and surrounding microbes, suggesting a role for microbe-microbe interactions in dictating the abundance within this host. Overall, our results demonstrate that while variation in the presence of specific genes can affect the success of a pathogen within its host, the majority of gene content variation is not strongly associated with patterns of host use."
https://openalex.org/W2752788688,"Background The World Health Organisation reports that road traffic accidents (accidents) could become the seventh leading cause of death globally by 2030. Accidents often occur in spatial clusters and, generally, there are more accidents in less advantaged areas. Infrastructure changes, such as new roads, can affect the locations and magnitude of accident clusters but evidence of impact is lacking. A new 5-mile motorway extension was opened in 2011 in Glasgow, Scotland. Previous research found no impact on the number of accidents but did not consider their spatial location or socio-economic setting. We evaluated impacts on these, both locally and city-wide. Methods We used STATS19 data covering the period 2008 to 2014 and describing the location and details of all reported accidents involving a personal injury. Poisson-based continuous scan statistics were used to detect spatial clusters of accidents and any change in these over time. Change in the socio-economic distribution of accident cluster locations during the study period was also assessed. Results In each year accidents were strongly clustered, with statistically significant clusters more likely to occur in socio-economically deprived areas. There was no significant shift in the magnitude or location of accident clusters during motorway construction or following opening, either locally or city-wide. There was also no impact on the socio-economic patterning of accident cluster locations. Conclusions Although urban infrastructure changes occur constantly, all around the world, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of such changes on road accident clusters. Despite expectations to the contrary from both proponents and opponents of the M74 extension, we found no beneficial or adverse change in the socio-spatial distribution of accidents associated with its construction, opening or operation. Our approach and findings can help inform urban planning internationally."
https://openalex.org/W2751346406,"Introduction Food insecurity is a major global contributor to developmental origins of adult disease. The allostatic load of maternal food uncertainty from variable foraging demand (VFD) activates corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) without eliciting hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation measured on a group level. Individual homeostatic adaptations of the HPA axis may subserve second-order homeostasis, a process we provisionally term “social allostasis.” We postulate that maternal food insecurity induces a “superorganism” state through coordination of individual HPA axis response. Methods Twenty-four socially-housed bonnet macaque maternal-infant dyads were exposed to 16 weeks of alternating two-week epochs of low or high foraging demand shown to compromise normative maternal-infant rearing. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) CRF concentrations and plasma cortisol were measured pre- and post-VFD. Dyadic distance was measured, and blinded observers performed pre-VFD social ranking assessments. Results Despite marked individual cortisol responses (mean change = 20%) there was an absence of maternal HPA axis group mean response to VFD (0%). Whereas individual CSF CRF concentrations change = 56%, group mean did increase 25% (p = 0.002). Our ""dyadic vulnerability"" index (low infant weight, low maternal weight, subordinate maternal social status and reduced dyadic distance) predicted maternal cortisol decreases (p < 0.0001) whereas relatively “advantaged” dyads exhibited maternal cortisol increases in response to VFD exposure. Comment In response to a chronic stressor, relative dyadic vulnerability plays a significant role in determining the directionality and magnitude of individual maternal HPA axis responses in the service of maintaining a “superorganism” version of HPA axis homeostasis, provisionally termed “social allostasis.”"
https://openalex.org/W2751461090,"ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) is a small GTPase necessary for regulating cellular structure, motility, and vesicle trafficking. In several cellular systems, ARF6 was shown to regulate actin dynamics in coordination with Rac1, a Rho small GTPase. We examined the function of ARF6 in the kidney podocyte because Rac1 was implicated in kidney diseases involving this cell. We found that ARF6 expression was enriched in human podocytes and that it modulated podocyte cytoskeletal dynamics through a functional interaction with nephrin, an intercellular junction protein necessary for podocyte injury-induced signaling requiring activation by tyrosine phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic domain. ARF6 was necessary for nephrin activation-induced ruffling and focal adhesion turnover, possibly by altering Rac1 activity. In podocyte-specific Arf6 (ARF6_PodKO) knockout mice, ARF6 deficiency did not result in a spontaneous kidney developmental phenotype or proteinuria after aging. However, ARF6_PodKO mice exhibited distinct phenotypes in two in vivo glomerular injury models. In the protamine sulfate perfusion model, which induced acute podocyte effacement, ARF6_PodKO mice were protected from podocyte effacement. In the nephrotoxic serum nephritis model, which induced immune-complex mediated injury, ARF6_PodKO mice exhibited aggravated proteinuria. Together, these observations suggest that while ARF6 is necessary for nephrin tyrosine phosphorylation-induced cytoskeletal dynamics in cultured podocytes, ARF6 has pleotropic podocyte roles in vivo, where glomerular injury-specific mechanisms might activate distinct signaling pathways that dictate whether ARF6 activity is beneficial or deleterious for maintaining the integrity of the glomerular filtration barrier."
https://openalex.org/W2752628302,"Hephaestin is a large membrane-anchored multicopper ferroxidase involved in mammalian iron metabolism. Newly absorbed dietary iron is exported across the enterocyte basolateral membrane by the ferrous iron transporter ferroportin, but hephaestin increases the efficiency of this process by oxidizing the transported iron to its ferric form and promoting its release from ferroportin. Deletion or mutation of the hephaestin gene leads to systemic anemia with iron accumulation in the intestinal epithelium. The crystal structure of human ceruloplasmin, another multicopper ferroxidase with 50% sequence identity to hephaestin, has provided a framework for comparative analysis and modelling. However, detailed structural information for hephaestin is still absent, leaving questions relating to metal coordination and binding sites unanswered. To obtain structural information for hephaestin, a reliable protocol for large-scale purification is required. Here, we present an expression and purification protocol of soluble mouse hephaestin, yielding milligram amounts of enzymatically active, purified protein using the baculovirus/insect cell system."
https://openalex.org/W2752603026,"Background Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a mechanistically heterogeneous disorder, and the ability to identify sub-phenotypes (“endophenotypes”) of AF would assist in the delivery of personalized medicine. We used the clinical response to pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) to identify a sub-group of patients with non-PV mediated AF and sought to define the clinical associations. Methods Subjects enrolled in the Vanderbilt AF Ablation Registry who underwent a repeat AF ablation due to arrhythmia recurrence were analyzed on the basis of PV reconnection. Subjects who had no PV reconnection were defined as “non-PV mediated AF”. A comparison group of subjects were identified who had AF that was treated with PVI-only and experienced no arrhythmia recurrence >12 months. They were considered a group enriched for “PV-mediated AF”. Univariate and multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate clinical associations between the PV and non-PV mediated AF groups. Results Two hundred and twenty nine subjects underwent repeat AF ablation and thirty three (14%) had no PV reconnection. They were compared with 91 subjects identified as having PV-mediated AF. Subjects with non-PV mediated AF were older (64 years [IQR 60,71] vs. 60 [52,67], P = 0.01), more likely to have non-paroxysmal AF (82% [N = 27] vs. 35% [N = 32], P<0.001), and had a larger left atrium (LA) (4.2cm [3.6,4.8] vs. 4.0 [3.3,4.4], P = 0.04). In univariate analysis, age (per decade: OR 1.56 [95% CI: 1.04 to 2.33], P = 0.03), LA size (per cm: OR 1.8 [1.06 to 3.21], P = 0.03) and non-paroxysmal AF (OR 8.3 [3.10 to 22.19], P<0.001) were all significantly associated with non-PV mediated AF. However, in multivariable analysis only non-paroxysmal AF was independently associated with non-PV mediated AF (OR 7.47 [95% CI 2.62 to 21.29], P<0.001), when adjusted for age (per decade: OR 1.25 [0.81 to 1.94], P = 0.31), male gender (OR 0.48 [0.18 to 1.28], P = 0.14), and LA size (per 1cm: 1.24 [0.65 to 2.33], P = 0.52). Conclusions Non-paroxysmal AF was the only clinical variable found to be independently associated with non-PV mediated AF. We demonstrated that analysis of AF ablation outcomes data can serve as a tool to successfully identify a sub-phenotype of subjects who have non-PV mediated AF.

https://openalex.org/W2753577898,"Adopting successful climate change mitigation policies requires the public to choose how to balance the sometimes competing goals of managing CO2 emissions and achieving economic growth. It follows that collective action on climate change depends on members of the public to be knowledgeable of the causes and economic ramifications of climate change. The existing literature, however, shows that people often struggle to correctly reason about the fundamental accumulation dynamics that drive climate change. Previous research has focused on using analogy to improve people’s reasoning about accumulation, which has been met with some success. However, these existing studies have neglected the role economic factors might play in shaping people’s decisions in relation to climate change. Here, we introduce a novel iterated decision task in which people attempt to achieve a specific economic goal by interacting with a causal dynamic system in which human economic activities, CO2 emissions, and warming are all causally interrelated. We show that when the causal links between these factors are highlighted, people’s ability to achieve the economic goal of the task is enhanced in a way that approaches optimal responding, and avoids dangerous levels of warming."
https://openalex.org/W2752821695,"Hypertension is a hemodynamic disorder and one of the most important and well-established risk factors for vascular diseases such as stroke. Blood vessels exposed to chronic shear stress develop structural changes and remodeling of the vascular wall through many complex mechanisms. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Hypertension-susceptible genes may provide a novel insight into potential molecular mechanisms of hypertension and secondary complications associated with hypertension. The aim of this exploratory study was to identify gene expression differences in the middle cerebral arteries between 12-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats using an Affymetrix whole-transcriptome expression profiling. Quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to verify genes of interest. 169 genes were differentially expressed in the middle cerebral arteries from hypertensive compared to normotensive rats. The gene expression of 72 genes was decreased and the gene expression of 97 genes was increased. The following genes with a fold difference ≥1.40 were verified by quantitative PCR; Postn, Olr1, Fas, Vldlr, Mmp2, Timp1, Serpine1, Mmp11, Cd34, Ptgs1 and Ptgs2. The gene expression of Postn, Olr1, Fas, Vldlr, Mmp2, Timp1 and Serpine1 and the protein expression of LOX1 (also known as OLR1) were significantly increased in the middle cerebral arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats compared to Wistar-Kyoto rats. In conclusion, the identified genes in the middle cerebral arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats could be possible mediators of the vascular changes and secondary complications associated with hypertension. This study supports the selection of key genes to investigate in the future research of hypertension-induced end-organ damage."

Ability to determine MA eligibility was compared to experienced CAC-providers using Nepali standard of care.Both women (n = 3131) and FCHVs (n = 165) accurately interpreted the wheel 96% of the time, and the eligibility checklist 72% and 95% of the time, respectively. Of the 649 women who reported potential contraindications or cautions on the checklist, 88% misidentified as eligible. Positive predictive value (PPV) of women's assessment of eligibility based on gestational age was 93% (95% CI 92, 94) compared to CAC-providers' (n = 47); PPV of the medical contraindications checklist and overall (90% [95% CI 88, 91] and 93% [95% CI 92, 94] respectively) must be interpreted with caution given women's difficulty using the checklist.

https://openalex.org/W2751075287,"We demonstrate that SCF-KIT signaling induces synthesis and secretion of endothelin-3 (ET3) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and melanoma cells in vitro, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, human sun-exposed skin, and myenteric plexus of human colon post-fasting in vivo. This is the first report of a physiological mechanism of ET3 induction. Integrating our finding with supporting data from literature leads us to discover a previously unreported pathway of nitric oxide (NO) generation derived from physiological endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) or neuronal NOS (nNOS) activation (referred to as the KIT-ET3-NO pathway). It involves: (1) SCF-expressing cells communicate with neighboring KIT-expressing cells directly or indirectly (cleaved soluble SCF). (2) SCF-KIT signaling induces timely local ET3 synthesis and secretion. (3) ET3 binds to ETBR on both sides of intercellular space. (4) ET3-binding-initiated-ETBR activation increases cytosolic Ca2+, activates cell-specific eNOS or nNOS. (5) Temporally- and spatially-precise NO generation. NO diffuses into neighboring cells, thus acts in both SCF- and KIT-expressing cells. (6) NO modulates diverse cell-specific functions by NO/cGMP pathway, controlling transcriptional factors, or other mechanisms. We demonstrate the critical physiological role of the KIT-ET3-NO pathway in fulfilling high demand (exceeding basal level) of endothelium-dependent NO generation for coping with atherosclerosis, pregnancy, and aging. The KIT-ET3-NO pathway most likely also play critical roles in other cell functions that involve dual requirement of SCF-KIT signaling and NO. New strategies (e.g. enhancing the KIT-ET3-NO pathway) to harness the benefit of endogenous eNOS and nNOS activation and precise NO generation for correcting pathophysiology and restoring functions warrant investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2753459326,"Serotonin (5-HT) brain architecture appears to be implicated in normal personality traits as supported by genetic associations and studies using molecular brain imaging. However, so far, no studies have addressed potential contributions to variation in normal personality traits from in vivo serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) brain availability, which has recently become possible to image with Positron Emission Tomography (PET). This is particularly relevant since availability of 5-HT4R has been shown to adapt to synaptic levels of 5-HT and thus offers information about serotonergic tone in the healthy brain. In 69 healthy participants (18 females), the associations between personality traits assessed with the five-factor NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R) and regional cerebral 5-HT4R binding in neocortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) were investigated using linear regression models. The associations between each of the five personality traits and a latent variable construct of global 5-HT4R levels were also evaluated using latent variable structural equation models. We found no significant associations between the five NEO personality traits and regional 5-HT4R binding (all p-values > .17) or the latent construct of global 5-HT4R levels (all p-values > .37). Our findings indicate that NEO personality traits and 5-HT4R are not related in healthy participants. Under the assumption that global 5-HT4R levels index 5-HT tone, our data also suggest that 5-HT tone per se is not directly implicated in normal personality traits."
https://openalex.org/W2752118359,"Heritable symbionts have been found to mediate interactions between host species and their natural enemies in a variety of organisms. Aphids, their facultative symbionts, and their potential fitness effects have been particularly well-studied. For example, the aphid facultative symbiont Regiella can protect its host from infection from a fungal pathogen, and aphids with Hamiltonella are less likely to be parasitized by parasitic wasps. Recent work has also found there to be negative fitness effects for the larvae of two species of aphidophagous lady beetles that consumed aphids with facultative symbionts. In both species, larvae that consumed aphids with secondary symbionts were significantly less likely to survive to adulthood. In this study we tested whether adult Harmonia axyridis and Hippodamia convergens lady beetles avoided aphids with symbionts in a series of choice experiments. Adults of both lady beetle species were as likely to choose aphids with symbionts as those without, despite the potential negative fitness effects associated with consuming aphids with facultative symbionts. This may suggest that under natural conditions aphid secondary symbionts are not a significant source of selection for predatory lady beetles."
https://openalex.org/W2753486991,"Leading-edge therapeutic laser technologies are not available at every medical facility; therefore, alternative approaches incorporating novel advances in digital and laser technology into more readily available conventional methods have generated significant research interest. Using a rabbit model, this study investigated whether the algorithm used in the Endpoint Management (EM) software system of the latest devices could enable subthreshold laser treatment in conventional retinal tissue laser therapy systems.Two types of devices were used, the PASCAL Streamline 577 and the MC 500-Vixi™, and the laser method was classified into three categories: EM; single-shot using PASCAL with arbitrary energy settings (PSS-SDM); and MC500-VixiTM (VX-SDM), which were performed in eight eyes from four Dutch-Belted rabbits. In EM, 100 mW (100%) was set as a landmark, and the laser energy parameters were gradually decreased to 80%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, and 10%, using a 2 × 3 square pattern. In PSS-SDM and VX-SDM, as control, the laser energy was gradually decreased to 100, 80, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, and 10 mW. The laser settings were fixed at 200 μm, 20 ms, and a wavelength of 577 μm. To identify and compare the extent of tissue damage at each spot size, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and histological findings were used to construct a three-dimensional histopathology image using a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope.The spot size at 50% setting on EM was 7183 μm2; PSS-SDM required 50 mW (5503 μm2) to 60 mW (10279 μm2) and VX-SDM required 50 mW (7423 μm2) to create the approximate spot size. Furthermore, at 50 mW of PSS-SDM and VX-SDM, the extent of tissue damage in all three methods was generally in accord with the outer nuclear layer by OCT and inner nuclear layer by histopathological imaging.These findings suggest that it may be possible to perform subthreshold laser therapy using approximations from the EM algorithm."
