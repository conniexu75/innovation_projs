PPARα regulates fatty acid oxidation primarily in liver and to a lesser extent in adipose tissue, whereas PPARγ serves as a key regulator of adipocyte differentiation and lipid storage. Of the two PPARγ isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPARγ2 generated by alternative splicing, PPARγ1 isoform is expressed in liver and other tissues, whereas PPARγ2 isoform is expressed exclusively in adipose tissue where it regulates adipogenesis and lipogenesis. Since the function of PPARγ1 in liver is not clear, we have, in this study, investigated the biological impact of overexpression of PPARγ1 in mouse liver. Adenovirus-PPARγ1 injected into the tail vein induced hepatic steatosis in PPARα−/− mice. Northern blotting and gene expression profiling results showed that adipocyte-specific genes and lipogenesis-related genes are highly induced in PPARα−/− livers with PPARγ1 overexpression. These include adipsin, adiponectin, aP2, caveolin-1, fasting-induced adipose factor, fat-specific gene 27 (FSP27), CD36, Δ9desaturase, and malic enzyme among others, implying adipogenic transformation of hepatocytes. Of interest is that hepatic steatosisper se, induced either by feeding a diet deficient in choline or developing in fasted PPARα−/− mice, failed to induce the expression of these PPARγ-regulated adipogenesis-related genes in steatotic liver. These results suggest that a high level of PPARγ in mouse liver is sufficient for the induction of adipogenic transformation of hepatocytes with adipose tissue-specific gene expression and lipid accumulation. We conclude that excess PPARγ activity can lead to the development of a novel type of adipogenic hepatic steatosis.

The PPAR subfamily consists of three isotypes, namely PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARβ/δ, and like all other nuclear receptors, PPARs possess a highly conserved DNA-binding domain that recognizes peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes (5Kliewer S.A.

After ligand binding PPARs heterodimerize with retinoid-X-receptors (RXR) and PPAR-RXR heterodimers bind to PPRE to initiate the transcriptional regulation of target genes, in particular those involved in lipid homeostasis (5Kliewer S.A.

The three PPAR isotypes are products of separate genes, and they exhibit distinct patterns of tissue distribution (7Desvegne B. Wahli W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 649-650PubMed Google Scholar). PPARα is expressed at a relatively high concentration in liver, plays a central role in regulating enzymes involved in the oxidation of fatty acids, and is essential for the pleiotropic responses induced in liver by structurally diverse chemicals known as peroxisome proliferators (8Zhu Y. Alvares K. Huang Q. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26817-26820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Zhu Y., Qi, C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D. Rao M.S Reddy J.K. Proc.

PPARγ is present in two isoforms, PPARγ1 and PPPARγ2, resulting from alternate promoter usage (1Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 8Zhu Y. Alvares K. Huang Q. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. J. Biol.

A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). PPARγ2 contains an additional 30 amino acids at the N-terminal end relative to PPARγ1. PPARγ2 expression is limited exclusively to adipose tissue where it play a key role in adipogenesis (1Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 2Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PPAR γ1 is expressed at relatively low levels in many tissues including liver, but the function of this isoform in non-adipose tissue locations is not well delineated (1Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 9Zhu Y., Qi, C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D. Rao M.S Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Forced expression of PPARγ2 or PPARγ1 can initiate the differentiation of fibroblasts to adipocytes, and in the process the fibroblasts express adipocyte-specific genes and accumulate lipid (2Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar, 14Mueller, E., Drori, S., Aiyer, A., Yie, J., Sarraf, P., Chen, H., Hauser, S., Rosen, E.D., Ge, K., Roeder, R.G., Spiegelman, B.M. (2002)J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar). Although there is some suggestion that PPARγ ligands may induce adipocyte-specific gene expression in certain tumor cells, it is uncertain as to whether PPARγ1 or PPARγ2 expression in vivo, in non-fibroblast mesenchymal cells, or in epithelial tissues can lead to adipocyte-specific gene expression and adipogenesis (15Agarwal V.R. Bischoff E.D. Hermann T. Lamph W.W. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6033-6038PubMed Google Scholar).It is well known that CCAAT/enhancer binding family of transcription factors C/EBPα, -β, and -δ have been shown to play an important role in adipogenesis in that high expression of each member of this family will direct fibroblasts to differentiate into adipocytes, and this conversion is mediated through down-stream regulator PPARγ and PPAR coactivator PBP/TRAP220/DRIP205 (4Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 16Lin F.T.

Nature. 2002; 417: 563-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). C/EBPs and PBP are expressed in liver, but the significance of this expression in terms of adipogenesis and or lipid accumulation in liver cells remains unclear. The inability of C/EBP and PBP to induce adipogenesis in normal hepatocytes may be due to the fact that down-stream regulator PPARγ (PPARγ1 in liver) may be rate-limiting in hepatocytes (19Ge K.

In this study, we used an adenoviral gene delivery system to overexpress PPARγ1 in mouse liver to determine whether this would trigger the expression of adipocyte-specific genes and lipid accumulation (steatosis) in liver cells. To avoid the confounding effect of PPARα, we used PPARα−/− mice (22Lee S.S. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar), and found that overexpression of PPARγ1 in these livers leads to adipocyte-specific gene expression and lipid accumulation. We also demonstrate that fatty liver induced by starvation or that developing after feeding a diet deficient in choline is not associated with the induction of genes associated with adipogenesis unlike that accompanying PPARγ1 overexpression in liver. These results strongly suggest that the low level of PPARγ1 appears to prevent liver cells from becoming adipocytes despite the prominence of C/EBPα gene expression in these cells and that overexpression of PPARγ1 leads to adipogenic hepatic steatosis.DISCUSSIONThe nuclear receptor PPARγ is essential for adipogenesis and lipid storage (1Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1224-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1982) Google Scholar, 2Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Spiegelman B.M.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307PubMed Google Scholar, 4Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). PPARγ is present in two isoforms, PPARγ1and PPARγ2, generated by alternate promoter usage and splicing (9Zhu Y., Qi, C. Korenberg J.R. Chen X.N. Noya D. Rao M.S Reddy J.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7921-7925Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). PPARγ2 isoform, which is expressed exclusively in adipocytes, plays a pivotal role in adipocyte differentiation and adipocyte-specific gene expression, but there is some controversy as to whether PPARγ1 isoform can initiate and sustain adipogenic gene expression (2Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar, 14Mueller, E., Drori, S., Aiyer, A., Yie, J., Sarraf, P., Chen, H., Hauser, S., Rosen, E.D., Ge, K., Roeder, R.G., Spiegelman, B.M. (2002)J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar,48Ren D. Collingwood T.N. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P. Camp H.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Tontonoz et al. (2Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Spiegelman B.M. Cell. 1994; 79: 1147-1156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar) reported that both PPARγ1and PPARγ2 could stimulate adipogenesis when introduced into fibroblasts, whereas Ren et al. (48Ren D. Collingwood T.N. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P. Camp H.S. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), using engineered zinc finger repressors to inhibit the expression of PPARγ isoforms, have concluded that PPARγ1 overexpression exerted no adipogenic effect. Recently, Mueller et al. (14Mueller, E., Drori, S., Aiyer, A., Yie, J., Sarraf, P., Chen, H., Hauser, S., Rosen, E.D., Ge, K., Roeder, R.G., Spiegelman, B.M. (2002)J. Biol. Chem., in pressGoogle Scholar) using PPARγ null fibroblasts demonstrated convincingly that both PPARγ1and PPARγ2 isoforms have intrinsic ability to induce robust adipogenesis. While most of the work on PPARγ-induced adipogenesis involved the use of fibroblast cell lines, the key question as to whether PPARγ1 isoform, which is the only isoform expressed in liver and many other tissues, can stimulate fat cell differentiation or transformation of hepatocytes into adipocytes. In this study, we have shown that overexpression of PPARγ1 in mouse liver induced adipocyte-specific gene expression as well as microvesicular steatosis in this organ. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that hepatic steatosis resulting from PPARγ1 overexpression is associated with adipogenic gene expression, whereas hepatic steatosis induced by starvation or developing after feeding a choline-deficient diet failed to stimulate adipogenic gene expression. Accordingly, we propose that PPARγ overexpression leads to the development of a novel form of hepatic steatosis, which is designated adipogenic hepatic steatosis or simply “hepatic adiposis” to distinguish this entity from the common forms of hepatic steatosis.Our results showed the expression of adipocyte-specific genes in liver upon overexpression of PPARγ1 whether or not these mice were treated with troglitazone. This may be due to the availability of putative endogenous ligands in liver generated as part of the normal lipid metabolism (49Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4312-4317Crossref PubMed Scopus (1850) Google Scholar, 50Hu E. Tontonoz P. Spiegelman B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9856-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Because PPARγ1 is endogenously expressed at a low level in mouse liver it is unlikely that this receptor exerts any adipogenic effect under normal physiological conditions. Furthermore, the relative abundance of PPARα in normal liver serves as a key regulator of fatty acid catabolism thereby minimizing the need for adipogenesis in liver to store lipids (11Reddy J.K. Hashimoto T. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2001; 21: 193-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 30Reddy J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2001; 281: G1333-G1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In that sense functionally active PPARα and fatty acid oxidation systems keep the PPARγ1 in check (30Reddy J.K. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2001; 281: G1333-G1339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results clearly establish that the overexpression of PPARγ1 isoform in liver in PPARα null background triggers the expression of adipogenesis-related genes and fatty change in liver. This process essentially represents conversion of hepatocytes into cells with active adipogenic gene expression profile, and in that regard this represents transformation or transdifferentiation of hepatocyte into adipocytes, i.e. the conversion of fat-burning hepatocytes into fat storage cells (31Li Y. Lazar M.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 1040-104819Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 32Walczak R. Tontonoz P. J.

Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11848-11853Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is important to note that the expression of adipocyte-specific genes and microvesicular steatosis observed in liver is not associated with overexpression of the endogenous PPARγ gene. RT-PCR analysis showed no induction of endogenous PPARγ1 or PPARγ2 isoforms (Fig. 6). Thus all the changes observed in gene expression patterns and morphological changes are the result of the exogenous expression of adenovirally driven PPARγ1 overexpression. These results suggest that maintenance of low levels of PPARγ in liver is crucial for preventing hepatocytes from encountering an adipogenesis fate. The maintenance of marginal PPARγ1 gene expression in liver may be achieved by unknown mechanisms designed to prevent positive feedback between C/EBPα and PPARγ because the downstream adipogenic events could manifest successfully in the presence of abundant PPARγ protein (4Lazar M.A. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).We performed Northern analysis and global transcriptional profiling to define the pattern of genes expressed in liver as a result of PPARγ1 overexpression. Our studies indicate that overexpression of PPARγ1 isoform in liver results in the up-regulation of many genes known to be up-regulated during adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts (31Li Y.

Adipogenesis genes up-regulated in liver include PPARγ target genes adipsin, aP2, adiponectin, caveolin, fat-specific protein 27, and others (Table I). Caveolae and caveolin-1 protein expression are most abundant in adipocytes (39Razani B. Combs T.P. Wang X.B. Frank P.G. Park D.S. Russell R.G., Li, M. Tang B. Jelicks L.A. Scherer P.E. Lisanti M.P.

The overexpression of caveolin-1 mRNA in liver expressing PPARγ is further indication of adipogenic transformation of hepatocytes in that caveolin-1 appears to participate in facilitating the conversion of triglycerides in lipoprotein form to triglycerides in lipid droplet storage from (39Razani B.

Caveolin-1 appears functionally necessary to maintain lipid droplet integrity, and the absence of this protein in caveolin-1-deficient mice leads to abnormalities in adipocyte function (39Razani B.

CIDEs belong to a novel family of recently identified cell death-inducing proteins that induce apoptosis when overexpressed (59Inohara N. Koseki T. Chen S., Wu, X. Nunez G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2526-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). CIDE is not normally expressed in liver, but increased levels of CIDE mRNA have been noted in livers of mice that were treated with Wy-14,643, a PPARα ligand (43Cherkaoui-Malki M. Meyer K. Cao W.-Q. Latruffe N. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Bradfield C.A. Reddy J.K. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). However, the CIDE expression was not dependent upon PPARα (43Cherkaoui-Malki M. Meyer K. Cao W.-Q. Latruffe N. Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Bradfield C.A. Reddy J.K. Gene Expr. 2001; 9: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The functional implications of up-regulation of three apoptotic genes in liver with adipogenic hepatic steatosis suggests that the acquisition of adipogenic phenotype places hepatocytes at greater risk for apoptosis. Additional studies are needed to ascertain if the CIDE, cyclophilin C, and nur77 genes are PPARγ targets for regulation. Studies are also needed to ascertain if DNA synthesis is a prerequisite for the adipogenic conversion of hepatocytes.It is of interest that this new form of hepatic adiposis or adipogenic hepatic steatosis resulting from PPARγ1 overexpression may have potential clinical implications. Individuals with relatively low hepatic levels of PPARα and hyperactive PPARγ1 resulting from single nucleotide polymorphism or by some other mechanism could develop adipogenic hepatic steatosis similar to that described in this report. It is also worth noting that ob/ob mice exhibit increased levels of PPARγ mRNA in their livers (60Memon R.A. Tecott L.H. Nonogaki K. Beigneux A. Moser A.H. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 4021-4031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Increased expression levels of aP2 and CD36 mRNA were seen in these livers when these mice were given PPARγ ligand troglitazone (61Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to consider PPARγ1 overexpression or hyperactivity as a possible molecular mechanisms responsible for a special type of non-alcoholic hepatic steatosis, designated as hepatic adiposis or adipogenic hepatic steatosis.Finally, we have identified a number of novel genes as modestly up-regulated in PPARγ1-overexpressing liver, which remain to be characterized (Table I). This includes a gene we designated as promethin (AY167031), which is induced in liver by PPARγ overexpression. Additional studies are needed to further characterize these and other genes to gain appreciation of the role of PPARγ in liver in relation to glucose homeostasis, energy utilization, and insulin resistance (61Olefsky J.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ),1 a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, is a key regulator of adipogenesis (1Tontonoz P., Hu, E. Graves R.A. Spiegelman B.M.

The PPAR subfamily consists of three isotypes, namely PPARα, PPARγ, and PPARβ/δ, and like all other nuclear receptors, PPARs possess a highly conserved DNA-binding domain that recognizes peroxisome proliferator response elements (PPREs) in the promoter regions of target genes (5Kliewer S.A.

The multisubunit IκB kinase responsible for this phosphorylation contains two catalytic subunits, termed IκB kinase (IKK)-1 and IKK-2. BMS-345541 (4(2′-aminoethyl)amino-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxaline) was identified as a selective inhibitor of the catalytic subunits of IKK (IKK-2 IC50 = 0.3 μm, IKK-1 IC50 = 4 μm). The compound failed to inhibit a panel of 15 other kinases and selectively inhibited the stimulated phosphorylation of IκBα in cells (IC50 = 4 μm) while failing to affect c-Jun and STAT3 phosphorylation, as well as mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 activation in cells. Consistent with the role of IKK/NF-κB in the regulation of cytokine transcription, BMS-345541 inhibited lipopolysaccharide-stimulated tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-8, and interleukin-6 in THP-1 cells with IC50 values in the 1- to 5-μmrange. Although a Dixon plot of the inhibition of IKK-2 by BMS-345541 showed a non-linear relationship indicating non-Michaelis-Menten kinetic binding, the use of multiple inhibition analyses indicated that BMS-345541 binds in a mutually exclusive manner with respect to a peptide inhibitor corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκBα with Ser-32 and Ser-36 changed to aspartates and in a non-mutually exclusive manner with respect to ADP. The opposite results were obtained when studying the binding to IKK-1. A binding model is proposed in which BMS-345541 binds to similar allosteric sites on IKK-1 and IKK-2, which then affects the active sites of the subunits differently. BMS-345541 was also shown to have excellent pharmacokinetics in mice, and peroral administration showed the compound to dose-dependently inhibit the production of serum tumor necrosis factor α following intraperitoneal challenge with lipopolysaccharide. Thus, the compound is effective against NF-κB activation in mice and represents an important tool for investigating the role of IKK in disease models.

Genes dependent on activation of NF-κB include the cytokines TNFα,1 IL-6, IL-8, and IL-1β; the adhesion molecules E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1; and the enzymes nitric-oxide synthase and COX-2 (for reviews see Refs. 1Siebenlist U.

Cell. 1997; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2931) Google Scholar). NF-κB normally resides in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells as an inactive complex with a member of the IκB inhibitory protein family. This class of protein includes IκBα, IκBβ, and IκBε, which all contain ankyrin repeats necessary to form a complex with NF-κB (for a review see Ref. 3Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Sem. Cancer Biol. 1997; 8: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). In the case of IκBα, the most carefully studied member of this class, stimulation of cells with agents that activate NF-κB-dependent gene transcription results in the phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser-32 and Ser-36 (4Brown K. Gertsberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). This is critical for subsequent ubiquitination and proteolysis of IκBα, which then leaves NF-κB free to translocate to the nucleus and promote gene transcription (5Finco T.S. Beg A.A.

Analogous serines have been identified in both IκBβ and IκBε, and phosphorylation at these residues appears to regulate the proteolytic degradation of these proteins by a mechanism similar to that of IκBα (8Weil R.

The use of gene-targeting experiments have clearly shown that all known proinflammatory stimuli, including cytokines, viruses, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) require the IKK-2 subunit for NF-κB activation (for a review see Ref. 18Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3294) Google Scholar). Although the role of IKK-1 in NF-κB activation is still unclear, recent evidence suggests that IKK-1 may only play a role in response to certain stimuli (e.g. RANK-ligand and Blys/BAFF) and in select cells such as mammary epithelial cells and B lymphocytes (19Cao Y.

Given the importance of NF-κB in regulating inflammatory processes, the identification of selective IKK inhibitors has received considerable interest. We report here the identification of BMS-345541 (4(2′-aminoethyl)amino-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxaline) as a highly selective inhibitor of IKK that inhibits NF-κB-dependent transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines both in vitro and in vivo. The compound appears to bind to an unidentified allosteric binding site of the IKK catalytic subunits. GST-IκBα was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and [33P]ATP (1000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences, and ADP, EGF, and staurosporine were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. A peptide substrate corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκBα (LDDRHDSGLDSMKDEEY; N-terminal acetylated and C-terminal amidated), along with a peptide inhibitor that corresponds to the same amino acids except with Ser-32 and Ser-36 changed to aspartates (LDDRHDDGLDDMKDEEY; N-terminal acetylated and C-terminal amidated; see Ref. 20Treiber, H.-J., Behl, B., and Hoffman, H. P. (1994) German patent 4,329,970Google Scholar), was synthesized by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). GST-tagged IKK-1, IKK-2, and IKK-ε were expressed in High Five cells and purified as reported previously (20Treiber, H.-J., Behl, B., and Hoffman, H. P. (1994) German patent 4,329,970Google Scholar). LPS (Salmonella typhosa) was obtained from Sigma. Proteosome inhibitor I and anisomycin were obtained from Calbiochem. 4,5-Dihydro-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxalin-4-one-2-carboxylic acid, prepared by the procedure of Treiber et al.

After the suspension cooled down to room temperature, hexanes (C6H14; 500 ml) were added to further precipitate the product. The solid was filtered, giving 4,5-dihydro-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxalin-4-one as a white solid (29.6 g). 1H NMR (500 MHz; hexadeuterio-dimethyl sulfoxide, d6-Me2SO) δ 11.7 (s, 1H), 7.91 (s, 1H), 7.31 (s, 1H), 7.29 (d, J = 8.1 Hz, 1H), 7.22 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 1H), 2.81 (s, 3H), 2.41 (s, 3H); MS (electrospray ionization), m/z 214.13 ((M+H)+; calculated for C12H11N3O, 213.09). A mixture of 4,5-dihydro-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxalin-4-one (29.6 g, 139 mmol) and N,N-diethylaniline (PhNEt2; 45 ml) was refluxed in phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3; 250 ml) for 1 h. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum; the residue was diluted with CHCl3 (1000 ml), followed by careful neutralization with cold saturated Na2CO3solution. The aqueous layer was further extracted with CHCl3. The combined organic layer was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated.

A solution of 4-chloro-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a) quinoxaline (4.8 g, 21 mmol) in ethylenediamine (300 ml) was heated at 60 °C under nitrogen gas (N2) for 16 h. The solvent was evaporated under vacuum. The residue was diluted with EtOAc (200 ml), washed with saturated Na2CO3 and brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated. Flash chromatography using methanol (MeOH) provided a solid, which was then dissolved with CHCl3 and filtered to remove any dissolved silica gel. The filtrate was concentrated under vacuum, providing 4(2′-aminoethyl)amino-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxaline as a white solid (4.67 g). 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3) δ 7.88 (s, 1H), 7.63 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 1 H), 7.26 (s, 1 H), 7.22 (d, J = 8.3 Hz, 1H), 6.31 (s, 1H), 3.63 (apparent q, J = 5.9 Hz, 2H), 2.96 (t, J = 6.0 Hz, 2H), 2.88 (s, 3H), 1.38 (br, 2H); MS (electrospray ionization),m/z 256.15 ((M+H)+; calculated for C14H17N5, 255.15). 4(2′-Aminoethyl)amino-1,8-dimethylimidazo(1,2-a)quinoxaline (4.67 g, 18.3 mmol) was dissolved with aqueous hydrochloric acid, HCl (1.0 N, 18.3 ml), and water, H2O (50 ml), at room temperature. Subsequent removal of water using a lyophilizer provided the hydrochloride salt as a white solid (5.22 g). Assays measuring the enzyme-catalyzed phosphorylation of GST-IκBα were performed by adding enzyme (IKK-2, IKK-1, or IKK-ε, typically to a final concentration of 0.5 μg/ml) at 30 °C to solutions of 100 μg/ml GST-IκBα and 5 μm [33P]ATP in 40 mmTris·HCl, pH 7.5, containing 4 mm MgCl2, 34 mm sodium phosphate, 3 mm NaCl, 0.6 mm potassium phosphate, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3% (w/v) glycerol, and 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. The specific activity of [33P]ATP used in the assay was 100 Ci/mmol. After 5 min, the kinase reactions were stopped by the addition of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and heat-treated at 90 °C for 1 min. The samples were then loaded on to NuPAGE 10% BisTris gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). After completion of SDS-PAGE, gels were dried on a slab gel dryer. The bands were then detected using a 445Si PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics), and the radioactivity was quantified using ImageQuant software. Under these conditions, the degree of phosphorylation of GST-IκBα was linear with time and concentration of enzyme. Because the above-described SDS-PAGE assay is not sufficiently precise for kinetic analyses of the IKK enzymes, assays for enzyme kinetic studies instead measured the enzyme-catalyzed phosphorylation of a 17-amino acid peptide corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκBα as described previously (21Burke J.R.

In this assay, either IKK-1 or IKK-2 was added at 30 °C to solutions containing peptide and [33P]ATP (1000 Ci/mmol) in 50 mm Tris·HCl, 5 mm MgCl2 at pH 8. After 60 min, the kinase reactions were quenched by addition of EDTA to a concentration of 10 mm. HPLC analysis was performed as described previously (22Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and the amount of IKK-catalyzed incorporation of 33P into each peptide was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Under these conditions, the degree of phosphorylation of peptide substrate was linear with time and concentration of enzyme. To measure the effect of the IKK inhibitor on IκBα phosphorylation in cells, 1-ml aliquots of THP-1 cells suspended at 2 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were preincubated for 60 min with inhibitor at 37 °C. To prevent degradation of phosphorylated IκBα upon stimulation, proteosome inhibitor I was also added to a final concentration of 1 μm during this preincubation. Cells were then stimulated for 5 min with TNFα (100 ng/ml) and pelleted by rapid centrifugation, and the pellets were solubilized using 150 μl of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40 in 40 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, containing 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 μm okadaic acid). SDS-PAGE and anti-phospho-IκBα immunoblot analysis were used to visualize the amount of phospho-IκBα produced. Quantitation of the bands was accomplished using luminescence capture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals Lumi-Imager) with data analysis using Lumi-Analyst software. Under these conditions, the levels of phosphorylated IκBα were increased 17-fold upon stimulation of the cells. In a similar manner, the stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-73 of c-Jun was detected with immunoblotting using anti-phospho-c-Jun (Cell Signaling) after a 15-min stimulation with 25 μg/ml anisomycin. The levels of phosphorylated c-Jun were increased 5-fold when comparing stimulated versus unstimulated cells. When measuring the effect on stimulated phosphorylation of STAT3, human lung epithelial H292 cells were resuspended at 2–5 × 106/ml following trypsinization and plated in a 12-well plate, 1 ml/well in serum-free medium for 18 h. Medium was removed and replenished with 0.45 ml of fresh serum-free medium. Inhibitor was added and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C followed by stimulation with EGF (100 ng/ml) for 5 min. Medium was extracted, and the cells were lysed and analyzed in a similar manner as above using anti-phospho-STAT3-specific antisera (Cell Signaling) for immunoblot analysis. The levels of phosphorylated STAT3 were increased 200-fold when comparing stimulatedversus unstimulated cells. To measure the effect of BMS-345541 on LPS-induced MAPKAP K2 activation in THP-1 cells, the general procedure of Kumar et al. was followed (22Kumar S. McDonnell P.C. Gum R.J. Hand A.T. Lee J.C. Young P.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Briefly, THP-1 cells in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum were preincubated with BMS-345541 for 1 h prior to a 30-min stimulation with LPS. The cells were then lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-MAPKAP K2, and the amount of enzyme activation was quantitated by measuring the MAPKAP K2-catalyzed phosphorylation of hsp27 using [33P]ATP as substrate. When cells were stimulated in this manner, MAPKAP K2 activity was found to be stimulated 15-fold over unstimulated cells. THP-1 cells in 96-well plates (2.5 × 105 cells/well in 180 μl of RPMI 1640/10% fetal bovine serum) were treated with BMS-345541 or no test material for 1 h prior to stimulation with 100 ng/ml LPS. Measurements of the amount of the cytokines IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-8 in the supernatants were made after 6 h of LPS stimulation and after 24 h for IL-6 production. Specific enzyme immunoassay kits from Pharmingen (OptEIA) were used in quantitating each cytokine. Under these conditions, IL-1β levels increased from 26 pg/ml in unstimulated cells to 2435 pg/ml in LPS-stimulated cells. TNFα levels increased from 51 to 905 pg/ml, IL-8 levels increased from 12 to 92 pg/ml, and IL-6 levels increased from <5 to 272 pg/ml. BMS-345541 was administered either by intravenous tail vein injection or by peroral gavage to groups of three 18–22-g female BALB/c mice (Harlan). BMS-345541 was formulated as a 2 mg/ml solution in 3% Tween 80, water. Mice received either a 2 mg/kg (1 ml/kg) intravenous bolus or a 10 mg/kg (5 ml/kg) peroral gavage. Whole blood samples were taken from individual mice by orbital bleed and cardiac puncture at 0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, and 8.0 h after dosing. Whole blood was centrifuged at 20 × 103 × g for 5 min. Serum was stored at −20 °C until analysis. Serum samples were treated with two volumes of methanol containing 1 μg/ml of an appropriate internal standard. After centrifugation to remove precipitated proteins, a 10-μl portion of the clear supernatant was analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem MS. The HPLC was interfaced to a Micromass Micro Quattro liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray interface. Nitrogen was used as the nebulizing and de-solvation gas at flow rates of 150 liter/h for nebulization and 900 liter/h for de-solvation. The de-solvation temperature was 300 °C, and the source temperature was 150 °C. Data acquisition was selected via reaction monitoring. Ions representing the (M+H)+ species for both the analyte and internal standard were selected in MS1 and dissociated collisionally with argon at a pressure of 2 × 10−3torr to form specific product ions, which were subsequently monitored by MS2. The transition monitored for BMS-345541 wasm/z 256 → 239 and m/z 326 → 270 for internal standard. Cone voltage and collision energy were optimized at 40 V and 20 eV, respectively. The retention time for BMS-345541 was 2.04 min. The 6-point standard curve ranged from 1 to 4000 ng/ml and was fitted with a quadratic regression weighted by reciprocal concentration (1/X). Standards were analyzed in duplicate. Quality control samples, prepared in blank plasma, at three concentrations within the range of the calibration curve were also analyzed in duplicate with each plasma analytical set. For this compound, the predicted concentrations of at least two thirds of the plasma quality controls were generally within ±15% of nominal concentration, indicating acceptable assay performance. The general procedure of Ghezzi et al. (23Ghezzi P. Sacco S. Agnello D. Marullo A. Caselli G. Bertini R. Cytokine. 2000; 12: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was followed. Briefly, 0.2 ml of an aqueous solution of BMS-345541 was administered by peroral gavage to 6–8-week-old female BALB/c mice (Harlan) 1 h prior to a challenge with an intraperitoneal dose of 1 μg of Escherichia coli LPS (from strain O111:B4; Sigma) in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Blood was collected from mice 90 min after LPS challenge, and the levels of TNFα in the serum were measured by enzyme immunoassay (R&D Systems). Inhibition by BMS-345541 was calculated from control animals that received LPS challenge but no BMS-345541 (vehicle only). Mice receiving no LPS challenge gave no detectable serum TNFα. Using an assay measuring the IKK-2-catalyzed phosphorylation of GST-IκBα, BMS-345541 was identified as an inhibitor of the enzyme. As shown in Fig. 1, BMS-345541 dose-dependently inhibited IKK-2 with an IC50value of ∼0.3 μm. The compound was considerably less potent against IKK-1 with an IC50 value of 4 μm and did not inhibit the related kinase IKK-ε. When tested against a panel of both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases such as human recombinant protein kinase Cα, protein kinase Cδ, protein kinase Cθ, protein kinase Cζ, protein kinase A, Her1, Her2, p38α, MAPKAP K2, JAK3, EMT kinase, lck, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and insulin-like growth factor-1R, BMS-345541 (Structure FTI) failed to inhibit any kinase at concentrations as high as 100 μm (results not shown).Figure FTIBMS-345541.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) When assayed in THP-1 monocytic cells, the compound dose-dependently inhibited the TNFα-stimulated phosphorylation of IκBα with an IC50 value of ∼4 μm (Fig. 2 A). The compound was not cytotoxic in this concentration range as determined by trypan blue exclusion (results not shown). Consistent with the compound being a highly selective inhibitor of IKK, BMS-345541 at concentrations as high as 100 μm failed to block both the anisomycin-stimulated phosphorylation of c-Jun and LPS-stimulated activation of MAPKAP K2 in THP-1 cells, as well as the EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of STAT3 in H292 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the compound was also effective in THP-1 cells at inhibiting the stimulated production of a number of cytokines from THP-1 cells including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-6. The IC50 against cytokine production in these cells fell in the range of 1–5 μm, which matched the inhibition seen against IκBα phosphorylation. This observation is consistent with both the essential requirement of NF-κB in promoting the transcription of these cytokines and the important role of IKK in regulating NF-κB activation. To investigate the binding mechanism of BMS-345541 to IKK-2, a simple analysis of whether the inhibitor was competitive with respect to ATP or peptide substrate was undertaken. However, non-linear fits of the data to both competitive and mixed non-competitive inhibition were very poor, and a definitive answer could not be obtained (results not shown). The reason for these poor fits is that the inhibitor shows non-linear binding kinetics. Indeed, Fig. 3 shows that BMS-345541 does not give a linear Dixon plot of [Inhibitor]versus rate−1. For an inhibitor that follows simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics, a linear correlation would be expected for competitive, non-competitive, mixed, and uncompetitive inhibitors. This non-linearity does not appear to result from solubility problems, because the compound is very water-soluble. Moreover, the Dixon plot of the inhibition of IKK-1 by BMS-345541 is more linear even at concentrations nearly 100-fold higher (results not shown), which indicates the effect is dependent on IKK-2. As an alternative way to investigate the binding mechanism, the effect of BMS-345541 on the inhibition kinetics of ADP and a peptide inhibitor corresponding to amino acids 26–42 of IκBα with Ser-32 and Ser-36 changed to aspartates was determined. Not surprisingly, ADP has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to the ATP substrate (24Huynh Q.K. Boddupalli H. Rouw S.A. Koboldt C.M. Hall T. Sommers C. Hauser S.D. Pierce J.L. Combs R.G. Reitz B.A. Diaz-Collier J.A. Weinberg R.A. Hood B.L. Kilpatrick B.F. Tripp C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25883-25891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and the peptide inhibitor is a competitive inhibitor with respect to peptide substrate (20Treiber, H.-J., Behl, B., and Hoffman, H. P. (1994) German patent 4,329,970Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 A, a Dixon plot of the inhibition of IKK-2 by ADP at different fixed concentrations of peptide inhibitor gave non-parallel relationships. At each fixed concentration of inhibitor, the value of kinetic constantA, 2Regardless of whether two inhibitors are mutually exclusive or non-mutually exclusive inhibitors, Dixon plots in dual inhibition studies should give straight lines such that the following relationship, shown in Equation 1, holds under the conditions where the concentration of one inhibitor is varied whereas the other is kept constant (26Hu Y. Baud V. Oga T. Kim K.I. Yoshida K. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 710-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar).Rate=1A[I]+BEquation 1 The definition of constants A and B will vary depending on whether the inhibitors are mutually exclusive and whether they are competitive, non-competitive, or mixed-type inhibitors. For instances, the definitions of A and B when using two mutually exclusive, competitive inhibitors would be as follows.A=KS[S]VmaxKIEquation 2 B=1Vmax1+KS[S]+KS[X][S]KXEquation 3 In Equations 2 and 3, X is the inhibitor with a fixed concentration, and I is the inhibitor whose concentration is being varied. It is important to note, however, that the non-linear aspect of inhibition of IKK-2 by BMS-345541 (see Fig. 3) does not make it possible to determine the intrinsic binding constants. which is directly proportional to the slope of the Dixon plots, were calculated by a non-linear fit of the data to be 775 ± 75, 1952 ± 229, 3286 ± 212, and 4564 ± 347 s·counts−1·m−1 at 0, 157, 314, and 471 μm peptide inhibitor, respectively. Non-parallel lines (i.e. increasing values of A) in this type of multiple inhibition analysis is the hallmark of non-mutually exclusive inhibitors and means that both inhibitors can bind to the enzyme simultaneously (25Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975: 474-504Google Scholar). This conclusion is expected, because the ATP and peptide binding sites of kinases are distinct regions of the active site, which allows both substrates (or inhibitors in the case of ADP and peptide inhibitor) to be bound simultaneously. Indeed, both ATP and peptide substrates are required to bind simultaneously for kinases to function as catalysts. A similar relationship exists between BMS-345541 and ADP as shown in Fig. 4 B. Indeed, the values for kinetic constantA at different fixed concentrations of BMS-345541 were found to be 853 ± 88, 1180 ± 203, 1287 ± 144, 1617 ± 104, and 2021 ± 207 s·counts−1·m−1 at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 μm BMS-345541, respectivel"

The current study was undertaken to determine whether ubiquitin conjugation is essential for degradation of oxidized proteins by the proteasome in intact cells. For this we utilized the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line, CH E36 and a cell cycle mutant derived from this line, ts20, which harbors a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1)1 (22Gillin F.D.

We also tested ubiquitin conjugation of progressively oxidized substrates, to determine whether oxidation actually increases the tendency of a protein to be ubiquitinylated. CH E36 and clone ts20 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Alan L. Schwartz, Washington University, St. Louis, MI. The parental cell line E36 is a hypoxanthine guanosine-phosphoribosyl transferase-negative mutant (HGPRT−) derived from the Chinese hamster lung fibroblast cell line V-79 (22Gillin F.D. Roufa D.J. Beaudet A.L. Caskey C.T. Genetics. 1972; 72: 239-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Clone ts20 is a cell cycle mutant derived from E36 cells by ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis (23Hirschberg J. Marcus M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1982; 113: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), which contains a thermolabile ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme (24Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A.

Both, E36 cells (wild-type for E1) and E1 mutant ts20 cells were grown as monolayers at 30.5 °C on minimal essential medium-α (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 4.5 g/liter glucose under 5% CO2. Flasks of both E36 and ts20 cells were shifted to the restrictive temperature, 39.5 °C, for a minimum of 2 h to inactivate E1. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, bathed in cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, and scraped with a rubber policeman. About 107 cells were resuspended in 300 μl of 1 mm dithiothreitol and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, with vigorous shaking for hypotonic lysis. The crude extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 × g in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C, supernatants were collected and stored at −70 °C until used. Protein content was determined using the BCA assay (Pierce) or the DC assay (Bio-Rad). Total soluble cell protein was separated according to Laemmli (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) by SDS-PAGE using a mini-PROTEAN II electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). Following transfer, the nitrocellulose membranes were probed with antibodies to E1 (Calbiochem) or ubiquitin (Chemicon) and visualized using the ECL chemiluminescent system (Amersham Biosciences). Antibodies to ubiquitin conjugation substrates were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (anti-ferritin) or Chemicon (anti-lysozyme). Live, attached cells were harvested by trypsinization and counted in a Z1S Coulter particle counter. Growth curves were performed by seeding equal numbers of cells in 24-well plates and then harvesting and counting cells at various time points. To test if H2O2 treatments were toxic, cell survival analysis was performed using neutral red (Sigma) uptake as described previously (28Babich H. Borenfreund E. Toxicology In Vitro. 1987; 1: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). 20 S Proteasome activity was measured at 37 °C as described previously (29Grune T. Blasig I.E. Sitte N. Roloff B.

Activity of the 26 S proteasome was determined by monitoring ability of cell lysates to degrade pre-formed lysozyme-ubiquitin conjugates. Ubiquitin conjugates were prepared from heat-denatured lysozyme as described below. These conjugates were then incubated either with extracts from ts20 cells at the restrictive temperature or with buffer alone, for 20 min at 39.5 °C. The reaction mixtures were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and the membranes were probed with an anti-lysozyme antibody. The amount of total lysozyme present in each lane was then quantified using NIH Image software to determine the net loss of lysozyme. Cells were seeded at 2–5 × 105 cells/ml in 24-well plates and grown at 31 °C. On day 3, cells were metabolically labeled with a [35S]Cys/Met mixture for 2 h (to generate predominantly “short lived” proteins) or for 16 h (to generate mostly “long lived” proteins) as described (5Grune T.

Both, CH E36 and ts20 cells were then shifted to the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) for 2 h to inactivate the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme in ts20 cells (cells were maintained at 39.5 °C for all further treatments). The monolayers were then exposed to oxidative stress by bolus addition of increasing concentrations (0.1 to 1 mm) of H2O2 in PBS, for 30 min. Following oxidative stress, cells were incubated in cold (nonradioactive) medium, with or without proteasome inhibitors, and percent protein degradation was monitored by measuring acid-soluble [35S] counts from previously acid-precipitable35S-labeled proteins as described (5Grune T.

FEBS Lett. 1998; 440: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was used for the quantitative determination of protein carbonyls. Isolated ferritin and lysozyme (Sigma) were oxidized with various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide as described previously (29Grune T. Blasig I.E. Sitte N. Roloff B. Haseloff R. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10857-10862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Proteins (1 mg) were exposed to various concentrations of hydrogen peroxide in an Eppendorf thermomixer for 2 h at 30 °C in a total volume of 1 ml of phosphate buffer. For heat denaturation, the proteins were incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min, followed by quick chilling on ice. Untreated proteins, peroxide-treated proteins, and heat-denatured proteins were extensively dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 200 volumes of buffer, with 2 changes, to remove any residual hydrogen peroxide or spontaneously generated fragments. Ubiquitin conjugation of purified protein substrates was carried out as described by Finley et al. (32Finley D. Ciechanover A. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 43-55Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), except that in our assay, the P-enolpyruvate/pyruvate kinase system was used for ATP regeneration and glutathione S-transferase-tagged ubiquitin was used as the source of ubiquitin. Briefly, the assay mixture contained 20 μl of CH E36 cell lysate (4 mg/ml), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3.6 mm P-enolpyruvate, 0.5 units of pyruvate kinase, 5 mm ATP, 5 μg of glutathioneS-transferase-ubiquitin, 0.09 units of inorganic pyrophosphatase (to reduce the build-up of PPi), 50 μmlactacystin (to inhibit proteasomal degradation of Ub conjugates), as well as 1 μm ubiquitin-aldehyde (to inhibit de-ubiquitinating enzymes). The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μg of oxidized or heat-denatured ferritin. For ubiquitin conjugation of lysozyme, the assay was similar except that the widely used creatine phosphate (10 mm)/creatine phosphokinase (100 μg/ml) system was used for ATP regeneration. In some reactions, ATP-depleted lysates were produced by incubation with 10 mm2-deoxyglucose and 0.5 units of hexokinase. After 20 min at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of SDS-PAGE loading buffer and an aliquot of the mixture was loaded on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels after boiling. After transfer, the blots were probed with antibodies to the substrate proteins ferritin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or lysozyme (Chemicon). Degradation of ferritin by purified 20 S proteasome was monitored by measuring acid-soluble free amines using fluorescamine, as described (8Ullrich O. Reinheckel T. Sitte N. Hass R. Grune T.

To determine the role of ATP, degradation of oxidized [3H]ferritin by cell lysates (60 μl; 2.5 mg/ml) was measured both in the presence and absence of 10 mm ATP. Percent degradation was calculated by measuring acid soluble radioactivity as described previously (14Pacifici R.E. Salo D.C. Davies K.J.A. Free Radical Biol.

Incubation of temperature-sensitive ts20 cells for 2 h at the restrictive temperature (39.5 °C) resulted in loss of E1. Cells were initially shifted to the restrictive temperature for 2 h, followed by sham treatment with PBS (or treatment with 500 μmhydrogen peroxide) for 30 min. In extracts of E1-mutant ts20 cells incubated at the restrictive temperature for more than 2.5 h, the enzyme could not be detected immunologically with an anti-E1 antibody (Calbiochem) at the expected position of 110 kDa (Fig. 1 A, lanes 4 and6). There was, however, no difference in the levels of E1 in the wild-type CH E36 cells when incubated at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 5). Both E36 cells and ts20 cells exhibited comparable amounts of enzyme at the permissive temperature of 30.5 °C (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained for cells treated with hydrogen peroxide (data not shown). To determine whether this was a truly functional inactivation of the enzyme, we looked at the ability of ts20 cells to form high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates de novo. CH E36 cells and ts20 cells were incubated at 39.5 °C for 3 h, after which equal amounts of protein from cell extracts were separated by a 12.5% SDS-PAGE. Following transfer, the membranes were probed with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Chemicon) to detect protein-ubiquitin conjugates. As seen in Fig. 1 B, the steady-state levels of endogenous, high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates were considerably lower in ts20 cells, than in wild type CH E36 cells, indicating markedly compromised ubiquitin-conjugating activity in ts20 cells at the restrictive temperature. Similar results were obtained by Kulka et al. (24Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) presumably because there is no de novo synthesis of high molecular weight Ub conjugates in ts20 cells at the restrictive temperature. Although this has been previously seen in ts20 cells (24Kulka R.G. Raboy B. Schuster R. Parag H.A. Diamond G. Ciechanover A. Marcus M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15726-15731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we reconfirmed these properties of the temperature-sensitive ts20 mutants in light of recent reports of residual ubiquitin-conjugation activity for a similar, yet distinct ts85 mutant cell line (34Deveraux Q. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6323-6329Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most short lived proteins are degraded by the 26 S proteasome in an ATP and ubiquitin-dependent fashion (35Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar). Baseline proteolysis of short lived proteins was reduced by almost 50% in ts20 cells, indicating that ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis was indeed compromised in temperature-sensitive E1 mutants (Fig. 1 C). It should be noted that besides ubiquitin-independent proteolysis by the proteasome, proteolysis is also conducted by other proteases. Similar studies have been performed in ts20 cells and in another E1 mutant cell line, ts85 derived from FM3A mouse carcinoma cells (36Ciechanover A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 57-66Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). We next ensured that the thermolability of ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis was solely because of a defect in ubiquitin conjugation and not inactivation of the 26 S proteasome at the restrictive temperature. For this we tested the degradation of pre-formed lysozyme-ubiquitin conjugates by extracts of ts20 cells incubated at the restrictive temperature. Ubiquitin conjugates of heat-denatured lysozyme were incubated with buffer alone (lane 1 in Fig. 1 D, and lane 1 in theinset) or with E1-inactivated ts20 extracts (lane 2 in Fig. 1 D, and lane 2 in theinset). After separation of the reaction mixtures by SDS-PAGE and transfer, the membranes were probed with an anti-lysozyme antibody and the resulting chemiluminescence was quantified using NIH Image software. Besides disappearance of individual high molecular weight lysozyme-Ub conjugates, densitometric quantification revealed a 60% loss of total lysozyme after incubation with ts20 lysates. Thus, ts20 cells incubated at the restrictive temperature for 3 h were capable of degrading lysozyme-ubiquitin conjugates, confirming that the 26 S proteasome was not affected in these cells. Similar results were obtained using extracts of wild-type CH E36 cell lysates (data not shown). Before testing a possible ubiquitin involvement in the degradation of oxidized proteins, we first compared growth properties at 30.5 °C (Fig. 2 A), 39.5 °C (Fig. 2 B), and with H2O2 in wild-type CH E36 cells and E1 mutant ts20 cells (Fig. 2 C). Hydrogen peroxide caused a similar growth arrest in both cell lines (Fig. 2 C) as expected from previous work (37Crawford D.R. Schools G.P. Davies K.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 329: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 38Wiese A.G. Pacifici R.E. Davies K.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 318: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Because the cells were maintained at the restrictive temperature for only 24–26 h, the two cell lines did not show a major difference in cell number. To test whether the ts20 mutants were more susceptible than CH E36 cells to hydrogen peroxide toxicity because of their thermolabile E1, we analyzed cell survival in response to H2O2treatment in both cell lines by the neutral red uptake assay (Fig. 2,D and E). There were no significant differences in survival over a 24-h period following H2O2treatment, further indicating that lack of ubiquitin-conjugating activity did not alter the short term ability of ts20 cells to survive an acute oxidative stress. Because most proteolysis experiments were performed at 39.5 °C, we measured the activity of the 20 S core proteasome in both cell lines, at both temperatures, to determine whether the proteasome was inactivated at the restrictive temperature. As seen in Fig. 2 F, the proteasome was not inactivated at the restrictive temperature and loss of proteasome-dependent proteolysis may, therefore, be attributed to defects in ubiquitin conjugation. To test whether ubiquitin conjugation is necessary for the degradation of oxidized proteins, we studied the turnover of short lived and long lived proteins after treatment with hydrogen peroxide in ts20 cells with compromised ubiquitin-conjugating activity. CH E36 and ts20 cells were metabolically labeled for 2 h (Fig. 3 A) or 16 h (Fig. 3 B) with [35S]Cys/Met to label pools of either short lived (2 h) or mostly long lived (16 h) proteins, respectively. As seen in Fig. 3, intracellular proteolysis was considerably higher in cells treated with 400 μm H2O2than in untreated cells. We have previously reported a similar oxidation-induced increase in overall proteolysis for many different cell types (4Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 5Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol.

BioFactors. 1997; 6: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) but we can now show that E1 mutant ts20 cells still preferentially degrade oxidized proteins despite the lack of an E1. Because a number of short lived regulatory proteins are known to be degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (35Rock K.L. Gramm C. Rothstein L. Clark K. Stein R. Dick L. Hwang D. Goldberg A.L. Cell. 1994; 78: 761-771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2172) Google Scholar, 40Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6736) Google Scholar), the total turnover of short lived proteins was considerably lower in ts20 cells, as expected. However, the relative increase in degradation because of oxidation was comparable for both cell lines, indicating that the pool of oxidized proteins can still be eliminated in ts20 cells. The degradation of long lived proteins (Fig. 3 B) also showed a similar oxidation-induced increase in both CH E36 and E1 mutant ts20 cells as seen previously for other cell types. In fact, it may be noted that the absolute increase in proteolysis because of H2O2 is actually higher in the ts20 E1 mutant cells than in the parent CH E36 cells (Fig. 3 B). In earlier studies we reported that moderate oxidation of proteins rapidly increases their degradation, whereas severe oxidation causes a gradual decline in intracellular proteolysis (4Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 5Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol.

The E1 mutant ts20 cells exhibited exactly this pattern of response to hydrogen peroxide concentration (Fig. 3 C), indicating that the E1 mutant ts20 cells utilize the same pathway for degradation of oxidized proteins described previously (4Grune T.

https://openalex.org/W2005570998,"Using commercially available recombinant human heat shock protein 70 (rhHsp70), recent studies have shown that rhHsp70 could induce the production of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) by macrophages and monocytes in a manner similar to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) e.g. via CD14 and Toll-like receptor 4-mediated signal transduction pathway. In the current study, we demonstrated that a highly purified rhHsp70 preparation (designated as rhHsp70–1) with a LPS content of 1.4 pg/μg was unable to induce TNFα release by RAW264.7 murine macrophages at concentrations up to 5 μg/ml. In contrast, a less purified rhHsp70 preparation (designated as rhHsp70–2) at 1 μg/ml with a LPS content of 0.2 ng/μg was able to induce TNFα release to the same extent as that induced by 0.2 ng/ml LPS. Failure of rhHsp70–1 to induce TNFα release was not because of defective physical properties since rhHsp70–1 and rhHsp70–2 contained identical hsp70 content as determined by SDS gels stained with Coomassie Blue and Western blots probed with an anti-rhHsp70 antibody. Both rhHsp70 preparations also had similar enzymatic activities as judged by their ability to remove clathrin from clathrin-coated vesicles. Removal of LPS from rhHsp70–2 by polymyxin B-agarose column or direct addition of polymyxin B to the incubation medium essentially eliminated the TNFα-inducing activity of rhHsp70–2. The addition of LPS at the concentration found in rhHsp70–2 to rhHsp70–1 resulted in the same TNFα-inducing activity as observed with rhHsp70–2. The TNFα-inducing activities of rhHsp-2, LPS alone, and LPS plus rhHsp70–1 were all equally sensitive to heat inactivation. These results suggest that rhHsp-70 does not induce TNFα release from murine macrophages and that the observed TNFα-inducing activity in the rhHsp70–2 preparation is entirely due to the contaminating LPS.

CD14, the endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) receptor, is a glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein lacking transmembrane and intracellular domains (20Stelter F. Chem.

TLRs are Type I transmembrane proteins with an extracellular domain containing a leucine-rich repeat and a cytoplasmic domain analogous to that of the interleukin-1 receptor family (18Medzhitov R.

Because rhHsp70 is produced by Escherichia coli expressing human Hsp70 cDNA, the final preparation may be contaminated with bacterial products such as LPS and lipoproteins. Contamination of rhHsp70 with LPS and/or lipoproteins could be responsible for the reported cytokine functions of Hsp70. In the current study, we demonstrated that the ability of commercially available rhHsp70 preparations to induce TNFα production by murine macrophages is solely due to the contaminating LPS. Recombinant human Hsp70 proteins were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp. (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Recombinant Hsp70 was cloned from a human embryonic cDNA library and expressed in E. coli. Two preparations were available, catalog No. ESP-555 (previously ESP-755) and NSP-555 (previously SPP-755). None of the two rhHsp70 preparations contained the constitutively expressed Hsp70 (Hsc70). Both rhHsp70 preparations were assayed for their abilities to bind and hydrolyze ATP. The ESP-555 preparation was the low endotoxin preparation containing <50 EU (endotoxin units)/mg of rhHsp70 as determined using the Limulus Amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, which was recommended for use in assays requiring low endotoxin. The NSP-555 preparation was not tested for endotoxin levels and was used in protein-binding assays. For the purpose of this report, the low endotoxin preparation, ESP-555, was designated rhHsp70–1, whereas the NSP-555 preparation was designated rhHsp70–2. Protein-free LPS (from JM83 E. coli K-12, rough strain) was kindly provided by Dr. John E. Somerville of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Before use, LPS was dissolved in sterile, pyrogen-free water, sonicated on ice for 30 s with a sonic dismembrator (Fisher), and diluted with phosphate-buffered saline (Invitrogen). Polymyxin B sulfate (catalog No. P4932, cell culture-tested), phosphocreatine kinase, creatine phosphate, and ATP were purchased from Sigma. Polymyxin B-agarose (Detoxi Gel, catalog No. 20339) was obtained from Pierce. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting detection solutions were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. RAW 264.7 murine macrophages (from American Tissue Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Subcultures of macrophages were prepared every 2 days by scraping cells into fresh medium. Murine macrophages were seeded in 24-well plates at 2.5 × 105 cells/well the day before the experiment. After washing 3 times with the medium, the cells were treated with or without rhHsp70 (0.1–5 μg/ml) and/or LPS (0.1–100 ng/ml) in 250 μl of medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 4 h at 37 °C. At the end of the treatment, media were collected and clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min in a microcentrifuge (Hermle-Labortechnik, Wehingm, Germany). TNFα content of the media was then determined by a quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using the Quantikine M mouse TNFα immunoassay kit (catalog No. MTA00, R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. All experiments were done in duplicate. In some experiments, rhHsp70 and LPS were heated for 60 min in a boiling water bath before being added to the cells. Likewise, in some experiments macrophages were preincubated with or without polymyxin B sulfate (10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C before the addition of rhHsp70 or LPS to inactivate LPS. The endotoxin activities of rhHsp70 and LPS preparations were determined using the LAL assay kit (catalog No.50–648U, BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The rhHsp70 preparations and fractions from polymyxin B-agarose columns (see “Removal of Endotoxin from rhHsp 70–2 Using Polymyxin B-agarose”) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 7.5% polyacrylamide gels followed by staining with Coomassie Blue or by Western blotting using an antibody to recombinant human Hsp70 (catalog No. SPA-812, StressGen) followed by ECL detecting system as described previously (25Gao B. Saba T. Tsan M.F. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2002; 283: 1196-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Densitometric quantification of rhHsp70 of the Coomassie Blue-stained SDS gels or immunoblots were performed using the FluorChem 8000 digital imaging system (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). This was performed as described previously (8Gao B. Biosca J. Craig E.A. Greene L.A. Eisenberg E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19565-19571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the uncoating reaction mixture contained 35 μg/ml (0.5 μm) rhHsp70, bovine clathrin-coated vesicles containing 0.5 μm clathrin triskelions (kindly provided by Drs. Lois Greene and Evan Eisenberg of the NHLBI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), 1 mm Mg-ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 30 units/ml phosphocreatine kinase and 15 mm creatine phosphate. The mixtures were incubated at 25 °C for 10 min, and vesicles in the reaction mixture were removed by centrifugation at 1 × 105 rpm for 6 min in a TL-100 tabletop centrifuge (Beckman Instruments). Clathrin released from the coated vesicles in the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Coomassie Blue staining, and densitometric quantification. The results, clathrin-uncoating activities of rhHsp70, were expressed as optical density ratios of clathrin/rhHsp70. Endotoxin in rhHsp70–2 was removed using polymyxin B-agarose (Detoxi Gel, Pierce) according to manufacturer's recommendation. Briefly, aliquots of 0.5 ml of polymyxin B-agarose were poured into Poly-Prep disposable columns (Bio-Rad) and equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline. Columns were washed with 5 volumes of 1% sodium deoxycholate followed by 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline. 250 μl of rhHsp70–2 at 100 μg/ml was loaded onto each 0.5-ml Detoxi column and incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The column was then eluted with phosphate-buffered saline in 250-μl fractions. The Detoxi column fractions were analyzed by SDS gels, stained with Coomassie Blue, and quantified as described above. Results were expressed as the mean ± S.D. Levels of significance were determined using a two-tailed Student's t test (26Fisher R.A. Yates F. Statistical Tables for Biological , Agricultural , and Medical Research. 6th Ed. Oliver and Boyd Ltd., Edinburgh and London1963Google Scholar), and a confidence level of greater than 95% (p < 0.05) was used to established statistical significance. The reported induction of proinflammatory cytokine release by rhHsp70 was similar to the effect of LPS, i.e. mediated through the CD14 and TLR-4 receptor complex signal transduction pathway (12Dybdahl B.

Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15028-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). Because induction of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) by LPS is also dependent on CD14 and TLR-4 (27Tsan M.F. Clark R.N. Goyert S.M. White J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: 1422-1430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we wanted to know whether rhHsp70 could also induce MnSOD. To avoid the potential confounding effect of LPS, we first studied the highly purified, low endotoxin preparation of rhHsp70, i.e. rhHsp70–1. We observed to our surprise that rhHsp70–1 not only did not induce manganese superoxide dismutase but also failed to induce TNFα production by RAW264.7 murine macrophages (data not shown). Failure to induce TNFα release from macrophages by rhHsp70–1 was in marked contrast to the reported effect of rhHsp70. For this reason, we decided to study the effects of both rhHsp70–1 and the less purified rhHsp70–2 preparation to determine whether rhHsp70 could in fact induce TNFα production by macrophages. As shown in Fig. 1 A, rhHsp70–1 at 1 μg/ml, as compared with control, did not cause an increase in TNFα release by murine macrophages. In contrast, rhHsp70–2 at the same concentration induced a marked increase in TNFα release to a similar extent as induced by 100 ng/ml LPS. Dose response studies revealed that rhHsp70–1 at concentrations up to 5 μg/ml failed to induce TNFα release. However, rhHsp70–2 at a concentration as low as 0.1 μg/ml induced a marked release of TNFα (Fig. 1 B). Likewise, LPS at a concentration as low as 0.1 ng/ml induced a marked release of TNFα from murine macrophages (Fig. 1 C). There were two possible interpretations for the above observations. First, rhHsp70 had no effect on the TNFα release by macrophages; the observed effect of rhHSP70–2 was due to some contaminant(s) present in the rhHsp70–2 preparation. Second, rhHsp70 did have TNFα-inducing effect; failure of rhHsp70–1 to induce TNFα release by macrophages was due to the presence of functionally inactive rhHsp70 in the rhHsp70–1 preparation. To distinguish these two possibilities, we determined the functional characteristics as well as endotoxin contents of the rhHsp70–1 and rhHsp70–2 preparations. As shown in Fig. 2, A andB, SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses of rhHsp70–1 and rhHsp70–2 revealed that both preparations were identical in rhHsp70 protein content, molecular weight, and ability to interact with an anti-rhHsp70 antibody. In addition, both preparations had similar molecular chaperone activities as determined by the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, rhHsp70–2 contained a markedly higher content of endotoxin than rhHsp70–1 as determined using the LAL assay. As shown in Fig. 2 D, the endotoxin activity of rhHsp70–1 was 4.1 ± 0.2 EU/mg, that of rhHsp70–2 was 577.0 ± 74.2 EU/mg, and that of E. coliLPS was (2.9 ± 0.7) × 106 EU/mg (n = 3). Thus, the endotoxin content in the rhHsp70–2 preparation was 140 times higher than that in the rhHsp70–1 preparation. The calculated equivalent LPS concentration in the rhHsp70–1 was 1.4 pg/μg, whereas it was 0.2 ng/μg in the rhHsp70–2. As shown in Fig. 1 C, the concentration of LPS present in 1 μg/ml rhHsp70–2, i.e. 0.2 ng/ml, was sufficient to cause the observed TNFα release from macrophages by rhHsp70–2. To determine whether the contaminating LPS in the rhHsp70–2 preparation was responsible for its TNFα-inducing activity, we first used polymyxin B-agarose (Detoxi gel) to remove LPS from rhHsp70–2. The concentration of rhHsp70 in the fractions collected from polymyxin B-agarose columns was determined using SDS-PAGE and densitometric quantification. The same amounts of rhHsp70 present in the polymyxin B column fractions as in the rhHsp70–2 preparation before passing through the column (Fig. 3 A) were then used to determine the endotoxin activity as well as the TNFα-inducing activity. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the polymyxin B column removed more than 95% of the endotoxin activity from rhHsp70–2. The endotoxin activity of rhHsp70–2 before the polymyxin B column was 577.0 ± 74.2 EU/mg, whereas it was 26.0 ± 14.2 EU/mg and 22.0 ± 2.8 EU/mg in the two fractions of the polymyxin B column. Likewise, polymyxin B column removed most of the TNFα-inducing activity of rhHsp70–2 (Fig. 3 C). Thus, polymyxin B column removed LPS from the rhHsp70–2 preparation along with its TNFα-inducing activity. In several similar studies (12Dybdahl B. Wahba A. Lien E. Flo T.H. Waage A. Qureshi N. Sellevold O.F.M. Espevik T. Sundan A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 15Asea A. Kraeft S-K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15028-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar), polymyxin B has been directly added into the incubation medium to determine whether the observed effect is due to LPS. Therefore, we also tested the effect of polymyxin B in the incubation medium. In these experiments, macrophages were preincubated with polymyxin B at 10 μg/ml before rhHsp70–2 or LPS was added to the incubation media. To make the comparison relevant, we used an amount of LPS (0.2 ng/ml) with an endotoxin activity equivalent to that found in 1 μg/ml rhHsp70–2. As shown in Fig. 4, polymyxin B markedly inhibited the TNFα-inducing activities of both LPS and rhHsp70–2. The above findings strongly suggest that the observed TNFα-inducing effect of rhHsp70–2 was due to the contaminating LPS. If this were the case, one would expect that the addition of LPS at a concentration found in rhHsp70–2 to the rhHsp70–1 should result in the same TNFα-inducing activity as the rhHsp70–2. As shown in Fig. 5, rhHsp70–1 at 1 μg/ml alone had no TNFα-inducing activity. However, the addition of LPS to the rhHsp70–1 at a final concentration of 0.2 ng/ml resulted in a similar TNFα-inducing activity as that of 0.2 ng/ml LPS or 1 μg/ml rhHsp70–2. One of the characteristics of LPS is its relative heat resistance. Previous studies show that the TNFα-inducing activity of rhHsp70 was heat-sensitive, whereas that of LPS was heat-resistant (12Dybdahl B. Wahba A. Lien E. Flo T.H. Waage A. Qureshi N.

Chem. 2002; 277: 15028-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). It was concluded that the TNFα-inducing activity of rhHsp70 could not have been due to the effect of contaminating LPS. As shown in Fig. 6, we also demonstrated that the TNFα-inducing activity of rhHsp70–2 at 1 μg/ml, but not that of LPS at 100 ng/ml, was sensitive to prior heating in a boiling water bath for 60 min. The demonstrated heat sensitivity of rhHsp70–2 in inducing TNFα release appeared in contradiction to our above conclusion that the TNFα-inducing activity of rhHsp70–2 was due to the contaminating LPS. However, the following evidence suggests that LPS at low concentrations, such as 20 ng/ml, is heat-sensitive and that heat sensitivity by itself is not sufficient to distinguish whether an observed effect is due to LPS. As shown in Fig. 7 A, the addition of 0.2 ng/ml LPS to rhHsp70–1 (1 μg/ml) resulted in a TNFα-inducing effect similar to that of 0.2 ng/ml LPS or 1 μg/ml rhHsp70–2 (as previously demonstrated in Fig. 5). However, the TNFα-inducing effect of the combination of LPS and rhHsp70–1 was as heat-sensitive as that of the rhHsp70–2. Analysis of rhHsp70 using SDS-PAGE revealed that heat inactivation removed most of Hsp70 from the rhHsp70–1 and rhHsp70–2 solutions (Fig. 7 B). Thus, it was possible that heat inactivation removed the rhHsp70 along with LPS from the solution, resulting in the observed lost of TNFα-inducing activity. To eliminate the potential confounding effect of rhHsp in the above-observed heat sensitivity of LPS, we heated LPS alone at two concentrations, 20 ng/ml and 20 μg/ml, and then determined the endotoxin activity and TNFα-inducing activity of 0.2 ng/ml LPS before and after heating. As shown in Fig. 8, heating 20 ng/ml LPS in a boiling water bath for 60 min markedly reduced its endotoxin activity as well as its TNFα-inducing activity. Likewise, heating LPS at 20 μg/ml also reduced its endotoxin activity and TNFα-inducing activity, but to a lesser degree. Thus, LPS at low concentrations is highly heat-sensitive. Results presented in the current study demonstrated that rhHsp-70 did not induce TNFα release from murine macrophages and that the TNFα-inducing activity of the rhHsp70–2 preparation was entirely due to the contaminating LPS. This conclusion was derived from the following evidence. First, the highly purified rhHsp70 preparation (rhHsp70–1) with an LPS content of 1.4 pg/μg was unable to induce TNFα release from macrophages at concentrations up to 5 μg/ml, whereas the less purified rhHsp70 preparation (rhHsp70–2), at 1 μg/ml, with a LPS content of 0.2 ng/μg was able to induce TNFα release to the same extent as that induced by 0.2 ng/ml LPS (Figs. 1and 2 D). Second, failure of rhHsp70–1 to induce TNFα release was not due to defective physical properties since rhHsp70–1 and rhHsp70–2 contained identical Hsp70 content as determined by SDS gels stained with Coomassie Blue and Western blots probed with an anti-rhHsp70 antibody (Fig. 2, A and B). Both rhHsp70 preparations also had similar enzymatic activities as judged by their ability to remove clathrin from clathrin-coated vesicles (Fig. 2 C). Third, removal of LPS from rhHsp70–2 by polymyxin B-agarose column or direct addition of polymyxin B to the incubation medium essentially eliminated the TNFα-inducing activity of rhHsp70–2 (Figs. 3 and 4). Fourth, the addition of LPS at the concentration found in rhHsp70–2 to rhHsp70–1 resulted in the same TNFα-inducing activity as observed with rhHsp70–2 (Fig. 5). Using rhHsp70 obtained from the same source as the one we used in the current study (StressGen Biotechnologies Corp.), a number of laboratories reported that rhHsp70 markedly induced TNFα production by monocytes and macrophages (12Dybdahl B.

(12Dybdahl B. Wahba A. Lien E. Flo T.H. Waage A. Qureshi N. Sellevold O.F.M. Espevik T. Sundan A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), none of the reports indicated which rhHsp70 preparation from StressGen was used in the studies. Using the less purified preparation of rhHsp70 (NSP-555/SPP-755 or rhHsp70–2), Dybdahl et al. (12Dybdahl B. Wahba A. Lien E. Flo T.H. Waage A. Qureshi N. Sellevold O.F.M. Espevik T. Sundan A. Circulation. 2002; 105: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) report that their rhHsp70 preparation had an endotoxin activity of about 100 EU/mg. They demonstrated that the rhHsp70 preparation could induce TNFα and interleukin-6 production by murine macrophages and human monocytes at rhHsp70 concentrations of 3–10 μg/ml. The endotoxin activities present in 3–10 μg/ml rhHsp70, e.g. 0.3–1 EU/ml (equivalent to that of 0.1–0.3 ng/ml LPS), were sufficient to induce the cytokine production as demonstrated in the current study. Other studies (15Asea A. Kraeft S-K. Kurt-Jones E.A. Stevenson M.A. Chen L.B. Finberg R.W. Koo G.C. Calderwood S.K. Nat.

These included the differential sensitivity of rhHSP70 and LPS to heat inactivation and the specific LPS inhibitory effect of polymyxin B. However, as demonstrated in the current study, these criteria are insufficient to rule out the possibility of LPS being responsible for the observed effects. The current study demonstrates that LPS is heat-sensitive, particularly at low concentrations, e.g. 20 ng/ml. This appeared to be contrary to the popular belief that LPS is heat-resistant (12Dybdahl B. Wahba A. Lien E. Flo T.H. Waage A. Qureshi N. Sellevold O.F.M. Espevik T. Sundan A.

However, the immunosuppressive activity of Shigella sonneiLPS has also been shown to be heat-sensitive (28Vikstrom E.V. Immunol. Lett. 2002; 80: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In the current study, we show that the results of heat sensitivity experiments may vary depending on the concentrations of LPS used to activate cells. As shown in Fig. 6, when 100 ng/ml LPS was used to stimulate TNFα release from murine macrophages, heat inactivation of LPS appeared to have no effect on TNFα induction. Results in Fig. 1 Cshowed, however, LPS at 0.1 ng/ml was sufficient to induce significant TNFα release from murine macrophages. Thus, even if heating in boiling water for 60 min inactivated more than 99% of LPS at 100 ng/ml, there would still be sufficient active LPS left to induce TNFα release, giving the impression that TNFα-inducing activity of LPS was heat-resistant. Results in Fig. 8 showed that heating LPS at 20 ng/ml, the same concentration found in 100 μg/ml rhHsp70–2 when it was heated, resulted in an 80% decrease in TNFα-inducing activity. This explains why the observed TNFα-inducing activity of rhHsp70–2 was heat-sensitive. In the current study, we demonstrated that removal of the contaminating LPS from rhHsp70–2 by polymyxin B-agarose column or by preincubation of macrophages with polymyxin B almost completely eliminates the TNFα-inducing activity of rhHSP70–2. In contrast, others observed no significant effect of preincubation or co-incubation with polymyxin B on cytokine-inducing activity of the rhHsp70 (12Dybdahl B. Wahba A. Lien E. Flo T.H. Waage A.

The effect of polymyxin B may depend on the concentrations of polymyxin B and rhHsp70 and the amount of contaminating LPS present in the final incubation medium. Further studies are necessary to clarify this discrepancy. In addition to rhHsp70, recombinant chlamydial Hsp60 and recombinant human Hsp60 have all been shown to have cytokine-inducing effects (29Kol A. Sukhova G.K. Lichtman A.H. Libby P.

Hsp70, Hsp90, and gp96 isolated from mouse liver are also shown to induce cytokine production (33Basu S. Binder R.J. Suto R. Anderson K.M. Srivastava P.K. Int. Immunol. 2000; 12: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar), although at concentrations 1–2 orders of magnitude higher than the recombinant Hsp70s. In view of the current study, further investigation is required to determine whether these observed cytokine-inducing effects of heat shock proteins (Hsps) was indeed due to the Hsps themselves or the contamination of LPS and/or bacterial lipoproteins in heat shock protein preparations."

Treatment with FGF2 or FGF4, or transfection with a vector expressing a mutant FGFR2 that is constitutively activated in the absence of ligand, strongly stimulates Runx2 expression. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays also showed that FGF2 treatment increases the specific binding of Runx2 to the cognate response element in the osteocalcin gene promoter. Blocking PKC completely inhibited FGF2-induced Runx2 expression, whereas mitogen-activate protein kinase inhibitors had no effect. The FGF/FGFR-stimulated 6xOSE2 promoter activity was also blocked by inhibiting PKC, as was the FGF2 stimulation of the DNA-binding activity of Runx2. Experiments with PKC isoform-specific inhibitors and dominant negative isoforms of PKC indicate that PKCδ is one of key isoforms involved in the FGF2-stimulated Runx2 expression. In addition, experiments with Runx2-knockout cells showed that, although the PKC pathway largely regulates FGF2-stimulated Runx2 activity by up-regulating Runx2 expression, it also modifies Runx2 protein post-translationally and thereby increases its transcriptional activity. Thus, we show for the first time that FGF/FGFR signaling stimulates the DNA-binding and transcriptional activities of Runx2 as well as its expression, and these are largely regulated by the PKC pathway.

Tyrosine 759 of the IL-6 signal-transducing receptor subunit gp130 has been identified as being involved in negative regulation of IL-6-induced gene induction and activation of the Jak/STAT pathway. Because this site is known to be a recruitment motif for the protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2, it has been suggested that SHP2 is the mediator of tyrosine 759-dependent signal attenuation. We recently observed that the suppressor of cytokine-signaling SOCS3 also acts through the tyrosine motif 759 of gp130. However, the relative contributions of SHP2 and SOCS3 to the repression of IL-6 signaling are not understood. Therefore, we designed experiments allowing the independent recruitment of each of these proteins to the IL-6-receptor complex. We show that receptor- and membrane-targeted SHP2 counteracts IL-6 signaling independent of SOCS3 binding to gp130. On the other hand, SOCS3 inhibits signaling in cells expressing a truncated SHP2 protein, which is not recruited to gp130. These data suggest, that there are two, largely distinct modes of negative regulation of gp130 activity, despite the fact that both SOCS3 and SHP2 are recruited to the same site within gp130.

On the other hand, mice expressing C-terminally deleted gp130 lacking the STAT-binding sites show a similar phenotype as IL-6-deficient mice (impaired humoral and mucosal immune and hepatic acute phase response) (19Ernst M. Inglese M. Waring P. Campbell I.K. Bao S. Clay F.J. Alexander W.S. Wicks I.P. Tarlinton D.M. Novak U. Heath J.K. Dunn A.R. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 189-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 is believed to mediate Tyr-759-dependent signal attenuation, because SHP2 is recruited to phosphotyrosine 759 after receptor activation and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated (14Symes A.

Darnell J.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1349-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-6 induced activation of the MAPK cascade is blocked by this receptor mutation. SHP2 is a ubiquitously expressed cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase containing two N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains and a phosphatase domain in the C-terminal half. The crystal structure of SHP2 suggests that, in the absence of a tyrosine-phosphorylated binding partner, the N-SH2 domain blocks the catalytic domain (20Hof P. Pluskey S. Dhepaganon S. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Cell. 1998; 92: 441-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar). Recently, Lu et al. (21Lu W. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) presented a mechanism for the regulation of SHP2 activity, suggesting that the N-SH2 domain interacts with the PTP domain to inhibit phosphatase activity. SHP2 becomes activated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine 542 or 580. Subsequently, these phosphotyrosines interact with the N- and C-terminal SH2 domain, respectively, relieving the PTP domain from the N-SH2 domain-mediated inhibition (21Lu W. Gong D. Bar-Sagi D. Cole P.A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 759-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).

The members of this protein family (CIS and SOCS1 through SOCS7) contain an N-terminal SH2 domain, preceded by the extended SH2 domain (ESS) and the kinase inhibitory region (KIR). Furthermore, a homology domain called SOCS-box is located at the C terminus (25Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H.

Thus, they are regarded as classic feedback inhibitors (25Endo T.A. Masuhara M. Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Mitsui K. Matsumoto A. Tanimura S. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyazaki T. Leonor N.

Several mechanisms by which SOCS proteins inhibit cytokine signaling have been proposed: SOCS1, and to some extent SOCS3, have been found to inhibit the kinase activity of Jaks, probably by binding to the activation loop of the kinase (30Yasukawa H. Misawa H. Sakamoto H. Masuhara M. Sasaki A. Wakioka T. Ohtsuka S. Imaizumi T. Matsuda T. Ihle J.N. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1309-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar,31Nicholson S.E.

Another model for SOCS function proposes the targeting of signaling components to proteasome-dependent degradation (32Kamura T. Sato S. Haque D. Liu L. Kaelin W.G. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3872-3881Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 33Zhang J.G. Farley A. Nicholson S.E. Willson T.A. Zugaro L.M. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Cary D. Richardson R. Hausmann G.

The latter is in line with the short half-lives of SOCS proteins (34Siewert E. Müller-Esterl W. Starr R. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The contribution of SHP2 to tyrosine 759-dependent signal attenuation has to be re-examined because we found that SOCS3 also acts through and binds to the phosphotyrosine motif 759 of gp130 (35Schmitz J. Weissenbach M. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12848-12856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Actually, the affinity of SOCS3 to a phosphotyrosine peptide corresponding to the Tyr-759 motif of gp130 is much higher than to a phospho-peptide comprising the activation loop of the Janus kinase (36Nicholson S.E., De Souza D. Fabri L.J. Corbin J. Willson T.A. Zhang J.G. Silva A. Asimakis M. Farley A. Nash A.D. Metcalf D. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6493-6498Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the affinity of SOCS3 to bind gp130 is even slightly higher than that of SHP2 (37De Souza D. Fabri L.J. Nash A. Hilton D.J. Nicola N.A. Baca M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9229-9236Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Although SOCS3·SHP2 complexes have been observed, the interaction of SOCS3 and gp130 appears to be SHP2-independent (35Schmitz J. Weissenbach M. Haan S. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12848-12856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). It was the goal of this study to dissect the contributions of SHP2 and SOCS3 to Tyr-759-dependent signal attenuation. We asked whether SHP2 is involved in the Tyr-759-mediated repression of IL-6 signaling and whether SHP2 and SOCS3 act independently from each other. Restriction enzymes were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) and Hybaid (Heidelberg, Germany). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG-Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Vent polymerase and antibodies specific for activated STAT3 were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). Recombinant erythropoietin (Epo) was a generous gift of Drs. J. Burg and K. H. Sellinger of Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany) and rIL-5 was purchased from Cell Concepts (Umkirch, Germany). Antibodies to the extracellular domain of the IL-5Rα chain were generously provided by Jan Tavernier (Gent, Belgium). Peptides were prepared according to standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) synthesis protocols. The peptides used had the following amino acid sequences: gp130: (Y(p)683, biotin-βA-NSKDQMpYSDGNFTD; Tyr-759, biotin-βA-TSSTVQYSTVVHSG; and Y(p)759, biotin-βA-TSSTVQpYSTVVHSG), SHP2: (Tyr-542, biotin-βA-KRKGHEYTNIKYSL; Y(p)542, biotin-βA-KRKGHEpYTNIKYSL; Tyr-580, biotin-βA-EDSARVYENVGLMQ, and Y(p)580, biotin-βA-EDSARVpYEN- VGLMQ) (pY indicates phosphotyrosine). The phosphotyrosine-specific antibody PY99 and antibodies to SHP2, to Jak1, and to the extracellular region of the IL-5Rβ-chain were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For immunoprecipitation of Jak1 a polyclonal antibody raised against Jak1 was kindly provided by A. Ziemiecki (Bern). The phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and the gp130 antibody were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY), and FLAG tag antibodies were from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO) and the Myc tag antibodies were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Mannheim, Germany). Recombinant IL-6 and sIL-6R were prepared as described previously (38Weiergräber O. Hemmann U.

The specific activity of IL-6 was 2 × 106 B cell-stimulatory factor (2 units/mg of protein). Cloning was carried out by standard procedures. pGL3α2M-215Luc contains the promoter region −215 to +8 of the rat α2-macroglobulin fused to the luciferase encoding sequence and was described previously (15Schaper F.

Expression vectors for the IL-5R/gp130 receptor chimeras pRcCMV-IL-5Rα/gp130(YYYYYY), pRcCMV-IL-5Rβ/gp130(YYYYYY), pRcCMV-IL-5Rα/gp130(YFYYYY), pRcCMV-IL-5Rβ/gp130(YFYYYY), pRcCMV-IL-5Rα/gp130(YYFFFF), and pRcCMV-IL-5Rα/gp130(YFFFFF) were used in reporter gene assays as described previously (17Anhuf D. Weissenbach M. Schmitz J. Sobota R. Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Linnemann S. Behrmann I. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 2535-2543Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). pRcCMV-IL-5Rα/gp130(YF) encodes a C-terminal deletion mutant of IL-5Rα/gp130(YFYYYY) lacking amino acids 766–918 of gp130. For construction of the pRcCMV-IL-5Rα/gp130(YF)/PTP chimera, the cDNA of an SHP2 protein lacking the N-terminal 208 amino acids was amplified by PCR. This fragment was fused to the 3′-end of the cDNA of the IL-5Rα/gp130(YF) vector by simultaneous elimination of the stop codon. For steric flexibility a linker sequence of glycine and serine residues (GS)5G was introduced between the residual part of gp130 and the SHP2 fragment giving pRcCMV-IL-5Rα/gp130(YF)/PTP. The construction of pCBC1-SHP2WT and pCBC1-SHP2C>S was carried out as previously described (15Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PCBC1-SHP2D>A was generated to encode a gene product that contains an Arg to Ala exchange at position 425 in SHP2. Vector pCBC1-Ψ-PTP encodes a mutant of human SHP2 lacking both SH2 domains (amino acids 1–208). For membrane targeting the myristoylation signal MGCMKSKFLQ of the murine hematopoietic cell kinase (hck) proto-oncogene p59 was fused to the N terminus. The expression vector pCBC1-PTP is identical to pCBC1-Ψ-PTP but lacks the myristoylation signal. These constructs were cotransfected for reporter gene assays with previously described EpoR/gp130 receptor chimeras (pRcCMV-EG(YYYYYY) and pRcCMV-EG(YFYYYY)) (15Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J.

The expression vector for murine SOCS3 was pEF-FLAG-I/mSOCS3 (26Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J. Rayner J.R. Jenkins B.J. Gonda T.J. Alexander W.S. Metcalf D. Nicola N.A. Hilton D.J.

The SOCS3 mutants S3Δbox, S3ΔN-term, and S3ΔESS were generated by exchange of the full-length SOCS3-cDNA by of DNA fragments coding for amino acids 1–183, 23–225, or 44–225 of SOCS3, respectively. The SOCS3 deletion mutants S3ΔN20, S3ΔN36, S3ΔC40, S3ΔC84, and point mutations S3L22D, S3F25A, S3L41R, S3G45A, S3R71K, and S3R71E were described previously (41Sasaki A. Yasukawa H. Suzuki A.

Human HepG2 hepatoma cells were grown and transiently transfected by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (42Yuan J. Wegenka U.M. Lutticken C. Buschmann J. Decker T. Schindler C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1657-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Transfections were adjusted with control vectors to equal amounts of DNA. Cell lysis and luciferase assays were carried out using the luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI) as described by the manufacturer. All transient expression experiments were done at least in triplicate. Luciferase activity values were normalized to transfection efficiency monitored by the cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector (pCR3lacZ, Amersham Biosciences, Uppsala, Sweden) (1.5 μg). COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FCS, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. Approximately 1.5 × 107 COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with 6–25 μg of DNA using the DEAE-dextran method. Briefly, cells were incubated in medium containing the DNA, 80 μm chloroquine, and 0.4 mg/ml DEAE-dextran for 80 min avoiding gas exchange. Afterward, cells were incubated for 1 min in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% Me2SO. After 24 h cells were split 1:2, and, after additional 24 h in culture medium, cells were stimulated. 3T3 embryonal fibroblasts were from SHP2 wild-type mice (SHP2 wt) or SHP2 exon 3-deficient mice (SHP2-mut) or reconstituted SHP2-mut cells stably expressing wild-type SHP2 were grown in DMEM with 15% FCS, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin (43Oh E.S., Gu, H.

These cells were transiently transfected with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. MAPK activity was monitored by GAL4/ELK-reporter analyses. Experiments were performed as described by Stratagene's instructions for the PathDetect Elk1 trans reporting system (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam). Briefly, luciferase reporter pFR-Luc containing a Gal4-promoter element was cotransfected with an expression vector for a fusion protein composed of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4 and the transactivation domain of the Elk1 transcription factor (pFA2-Elk1). Transfection efficiency was monitored by using a cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector as described above. Activated MAPKs lead to phosphorylation of the Elk transactivation domain and thus to expression of luciferase. The preparation of nuclear extracts, measurements of protein concentrations, and EMSAs have been described previously (44Horsten U. Müller-Newen G. Gerhartz C. Wollmer A. Wijdenes J. Heinrich P.C.

For STAT1- and STAT3-specific double-stranded 32P-labeled probes, we used a mutated SIE oligonucleotide of the c-fospromoter (m67 SIE, 5′-GATCCGGGAGGGATTTACGGGAAATGCTG-3′) (45Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Protein·DNA complexes were separated on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5% glycerol in 0.25 × TBE at 20 V/cm for 4 h. Gels were fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 80% water for 30 min, dried, and autoradiographed. For immunoprecipitations 2 × 107 cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1% Triton X-100; 10% glycerol; 1 mmEGTA; 1.5 mm MgCl2) or for peptide/protein coprecipitation in Brij-lysis buffer (1% Brij-96; 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA). Buffers were supplemented with aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin (10 μg/ml of each). Equal amounts of cellular protein were incubated with the appropriate antibodies or with 2 μm biotinylated peptides at 4 °C overnight and precipitated with 2.5 mg of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences, Sweden) or NeutrAvidin-coupled agarose (Pierce, Rockford, IL), respectively. Immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antigens were detected by incubation with the appropriate primary antibodies (PY99, 1:100; 4G10, 1:1000; anti-SHP2, 1:1000; anti-Jak1, 1:1000; anti-FLAGM2-biotin, 1:500; anti-Myc, 1:1000; IL-5Rα, 1:1000; and IL-5Rβ, 1:1000) and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (1:2000) (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) or horseradish peroxidase-coupled streptavidin (1:5000) (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The membranes were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). Blots were stripped and reprobed to verify application of equal amounts of protein. Human SOCS3 was expressed as a thioredoxin fusion protein in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Bacteria were grown in LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C to anA 600 of 1 and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested after 3 h of expression, resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and lysed by sonification. SOCS3 was purified on a HiTrap chelating 5-ml column (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) with nickel-iminodiacetic acid (Ni-IDA) as matrix. Native eluted SOCS3 was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, 10 mmdithiothreitol, pH 8.5 and purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany). For biosensor measurements the protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.05% Chaps. Purity of the recombinant protein was monitored by SDS-PAGE. Biotinylated peptides were loaded on a streptAvidin-coated Biosensor chip (Biacore, Freiburg, Germany). The amount of loaded peptide was 80 ± 4 fmol/mm2 chip surface, which corresponds to 141 ± 5 response units. Before loading of the sensor chip with peptide, the surface was washed three times for 30 s with 1 m NaCl/50 mm NaOH. Peptides (100 ng/ml) were loaded onto the chip until 150 response units were reached. Protein-peptide interactions were measured by injection of serial dilutions of recombinant human SOCS3/thioredoxin fusion protein over the chip surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 1 min. Before injection of SOCS protein, the sensor chip was flushed with bovine serum albumin (0.1 mg/ml) at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 1 min. For measurement of K D values, the flow rate was enhanced to 100 μl/min to obtain higher resolution of kinetics. For this type of experiment SOCS3 was injected for 3 min, dissociation time was 5 min, and regeneration of the chip between the measurements in all experiments performed was done at 20 μl/min with 1 m NaCl in 50 mm NaOH for 30 s. Binding curves were analyzed by using BiaEvaluation software version 3.0.1 (Biacore). To correct for nonspecific binding events, an empty sensor surface without peptide was analyzed in parallel during protein injection. Additionally, thioredoxin was injected at high concentrations (3.5 μm) to rule out nonspecific interactions with the SOCS3 fusion protein. Curves were plotted with nonspecific binding subtracted. Determination of dissociation constants was done by Scatchard analysis (46Payne"
https://openalex.org/W2093884797,"Hypoxia-induced up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is a critical event leading to tumor neovascularization. Hypoxia stimulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a transcriptional activator of VEGF. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, an inducible enzyme that catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid, is also induced by hypoxia. We reported previously that COX-2 inhibition prevents hypoxic up-regulation of VEGF in human prostate cancer cells and that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) restores hypoxic effects on VEGF. We hypothesized that PGE2 mediates hypoxic effects on VEGF by modulating HIF-1α expression. Addition of PGE2 to PC-3ML human prostate cancer cells had no effect on HIF-1α mRNA levels. However, PGE2 significantly increased HIF-1α protein levels, particularly in the nucleus. This effect of PGE2 largely results from the promotion of HIF-1α translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. PGE2 addition to PC-3 ML cells transfected with a GFP-HIF-1α vector induced a time-dependent nuclear accumulation of the HIF-1α protein. Two selective COX-2 inhibitors, meloxicam and NS398, decreased HIF-1α levels and nuclear localization, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Of several prostaglandins tested, only PGE2 reversed the effects of a COX-2 inhibitor in hypoxic cells. Finally, PGE2 effects on HIF-1α were specifically inhibited by PD98059 (a MAPK inhibitor). These data demonstrate that PGE2 production via COX-2-catalyzed pathway plays a critical role in HIF-1α regulation by hypoxia and imply that COX-2 inhibitors can prevent hypoxic induction of HIF-mediated gene transcription in cancer cells. Hypoxia-induced up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression is a critical event leading to tumor neovascularization. Hypoxia stimulates hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a transcriptional activator of VEGF. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, an inducible enzyme that catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid, is also induced by hypoxia. We reported previously that COX-2 inhibition prevents hypoxic up-regulation of VEGF in human prostate cancer cells and that prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) restores hypoxic effects on VEGF. We hypothesized that PGE2 mediates hypoxic effects on VEGF by modulating HIF-1α expression. Addition of PGE2 to PC-3ML human prostate cancer cells had no effect on HIF-1α mRNA levels. However, PGE2 significantly increased HIF-1α protein levels, particularly in the nucleus. This effect of PGE2 largely results from the promotion of HIF-1α translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. PGE2 addition to PC-3 ML cells transfected with a GFP-HIF-1α vector induced a time-dependent nuclear accumulation of the HIF-1α protein. Two selective COX-2 inhibitors, meloxicam and NS398, decreased HIF-1α levels and nuclear localization, under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Of several prostaglandins tested, only PGE2 reversed the effects of a COX-2 inhibitor in hypoxic cells. Finally, PGE2 effects on HIF-1α were specifically inhibited by PD98059 (a MAPK inhibitor). These data demonstrate that PGE2 production via COX-2-catalyzed pathway plays a critical role in HIF-1α regulation by hypoxia and imply that COX-2 inhibitors can prevent hypoxic induction of HIF-mediated gene transcription in cancer cells. It is well established that all tumors require the growth of new blood vessels, a process termed angiogenesis, in order to grow beyond 1–2 mm, invade, and metastasize (1Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 82: 4-7Crossref Scopus (4376) Google Scholar). One of the major regulatory factors involved in neovascularization is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; COX, cyclooxygenase; PG, prostaglandin; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PI3K, phosphoinositol 3-kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Rt, reverse transcriptase; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau; RT, reverse transcriptase1The abbreviations used are: VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; COX, cyclooxygenase; PG, prostaglandin; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PI3K, phosphoinositol 3-kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Rt, reverse transcriptase; VHL, von Hippel-Lindau; RT, reverse transcriptase Intratumoral hypoxia is a potent VEGF inducer in solid tumors. Hypoxic regulation of VEGF is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a key transcription factor that regulates cellular responses to physiological and pathological hypoxia (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). The VEGF gene contains a number of HIF-1α-binding sites in its regulatory region, and HIF-1α is able to activate the VEGF promoter (3Shima D.T. Kuroki M. Deutsch U. Ng Y.S. Adamis A.P. D'Amore P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 271: 3877-3883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Deletion of the HIF-1α gene or disruption of HIF-1α transcription results in the lack of VEGF secretion by tumor cells, suppression of angiogenesis, and inhibition of solid tumor growth (4Kung A. Wang S. Klco J.M. Kaelin W.G. Livingston D.M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 5Carmeliet P. Dor Y. Herbert J.M. Fukumura D. Brusselmans K. Dewerchin M.

In response to hypoxia, HIF-1α protein accumulates in the cytosol and translocates to the nucleus (6Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it activates hypoxia-sensitive genes, like VEGF, by binding to their promoter/enhancer regions (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). HIF-1α-mediated up-regulation of VEGF, therefore, has been proposed as an angiogenic switch during tumorigenesis (7Fang J.M. Yan L. Shing Y. Moses M.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5731-5735PubMed Google Scholar).Hypoxic effects on HIF-1α occur mainly at the post-translational level, as HIF-1α mRNA levels are not significantly modified by hypoxia (2Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (4974) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions, HIF-1α protein is rapidly degraded via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (8Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4070) Google Scholar). The VHL protein recognizes the oxygen degradation domain of HIF-1α protein only under normoxic conditions (9Yu F. White S.B. Zhao Q. Lee F.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4136-4142PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to hypoxia, a variety of factors have recently been demonstrated to be regulators of HIF-1α expression, including reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide, cytokines, and growth factors (10Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The regulation of HIF-1α by hypoxia as well as these other factors involves the activation of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway (10Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) and/or phosphorylation by p42/p44 MAP kinase (10Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin.

Two isoforms of COX have been identified. COX-1 is expressed constitutively in many tissues and cell types, whereas COX-2 is inducible by a variety of factors, including cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters. COX-2 is highly expressed in a number of human cancers and cancer cell lines, including prostate cancer (14Taketo M.M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 1609-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 15Tjandrawinata R.R. Dahiya R. Hughes-Fulford M. Br. J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that COX-2 expression and activity are induced by hypoxia in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and this induction is not mediated by HIF-1α but rather by the nuclear factor κB transcription factor. Forced overexpression of COX-2 in a colon cancer cell line results in the overproduction of several pro-angiogenic factors, including VEGF (18Tsujii M. Kawano S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H. Hori M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2205) Google Scholar). In addition, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a major end product of the COX-2-catalyzed reaction, is reported to be a stimulator of angiogenesis (19Form D.M. Auerbach R. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1983; 172: 214-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar).We demonstrated that inhibition of COX-2 suppresses prostate cancer growth and angiogenesis in vivo. Tumors treated with a COX-2 inhibitor were smaller, with increased apoptosis, decreased microvessel density, and decreased tumor VEGF levels (20Liu X.H. Kirschenbaum A. Yao S. Lee R. Holland J.F. Levine A.C. J. Urol. 2000; 164: 820-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our in vitrostudies demonstrated that the administration of a selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS398, prevented the effects of cobalt chloride-simulated hypoxia on VEGF up-regulation in PC-3ML human prostate cancer cells. In that same report, PGE2administration restored the effects of cobalt chloride on VEGF in the presence of the COX-2 inhibitor (21Liu X.H. Kirschenbaum A. Yao S. Stearns M.E. Holland J.F. Claffey K. Levine A.C. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Similar results have recently been observed when the same cell line was exposed to true hypoxia (1% O2). 2X. H. Liu, A. Kirschenbaum, M. Lu, S. Yao, A. Dosoretz, J. F. Holland, and A. C. Levine, unpublished data.2X. H. Liu, A. Kirschenbaum, M. Lu, S. Yao, A. Dosoretz, J. F. Holland, and A. C. Levine, unpublished data.We concluded that COX-2 and PGE2 are involved in the hypoxic induction of VEGF. We hypothesized that the effects of COX-2 and PGE2 on hypoxia-induced VEGF are mediated by the regulation of HIF-1α expression and activation in PC-3ML human prostate tumor cells. In this report, we demonstrate that PGE2 has no effect on HIF-1α mRNA expression. However, PGE2, under normoxic conditions, promotes HIF-1α protein stabilization, particularly in the nucleus. This effect of PGE2 largely results from the promotion of HIF-1α protein translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. In addition, we demonstrate that hypoxia-induced HIF-1α accumulation is suppressed by inhibition of COX-2 activity and restored by the addition of exogenous PGE2. Finally, we provide evidence that the effects of PGE2 are mediated, primarily, via the MAP kinase pathway. Our findings demonstrate a critical role for COX-2 and PGE2in the regulation of HIF-1α and VEGF.DISCUSSIONThere is ample evidence that COX-2 overexpression contributes to carcinogenesis and that COX-2 disruption can both prevent and treat a variety of solid tumors (14Taketo M.M.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4245-4249PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to these direct effects, prostaglandins derived from COX-2 exert indirect effects on tumor growth via the promotion of tumor angiogenesis (18Tsujii M. Kawano S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H.

Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). COX-2 effects on angiogenesis are mediated, at least in part, by modulation of VEGF expression (18Tsujii M.

Levine A.C. J. Urol. 2000; 164: 820-825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies (20Liu X.H. Kirschenbaum A. Yao S. Lee R. Holland J.F. Levine A.C. J.

Invest. 2000; 105: 1589-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) have shown that inhibition of COX-2 activity (via genetic knockout or pharmacologic inhibitors) results in decreased tumor and stromal VEGF levels with resultant impairment of tumor growth and angiogenesis. PGE2, one of the major eicosanoid products of the COX-2-catalyzed reaction, has also been specifically implicated in the promotion of VEGF expression and tumor angiogenesis in a variety of cell types (37Harada S. Nagy J.A. Sullivan K.A. Thomas K.A. Endo N. Rodan G.A. Rodan S.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2490-2496Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 38Hoper M.M. Voelkel N.F. Bates T.O. Allard J.D.

Biol. 1997; 17: 748-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Our previous studies with human prostate cancer cells in vitro delineated one cell line, PC-3 ML, in which VEGF levels were dramatically up-regulated by cobalt chloride-simulated hypoxia. Administration of a selective COX-2 inhibitor prevented hypoxia-simulated up-regulation of VEGF, and the co-administration of PGE2 restored the ability of hypoxia to increase VEGF in the presence of the COX-2 inhibitor (21Liu X.H. Kirschenbaum A. Yao S. Stearns M.E. Holland J.F. Claffey K. Levine A.C. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In the current report, we studied the effects of true hypoxia and PGE2 on the expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a master oxygen sensor, in the same prostate cancer cell line. PGE2had no effect on HIF-1α mRNA levels but did modulate its protein expression. The lack of effect of PGE2 on transcriptional activation of HIF-1α was not surprising in view of the fact that hypoxic regulation of HIF-1α is also primarily determined by stabilization of HIF-1α protein, which is otherwise rapidly degraded in oxygenated cells (23Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar).The mechanisms underlying hypoxic effects on the ubiquitin-ligase complex responsible for HIF-1α protein degradation have been well elucidated recently by the identification of an oxygen- and iron-dependent proline hydroxylase responsible for the post-translational modification of HIF-1α. Proline hydroxylation of the oxygen-dependent domain of HIF-1α results in recognition of the protein by pVHL and subsequent ubiquitination and degradation (39Bruick R.K. McKnight S.L. Science. 2001; 294: 1337-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (2088) Google Scholar, 40Ivan M. Kondo K. Yang H. Kim W. Valiando J. Ohh M. Salic A. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Kaelin Jr., W.G.

Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4367) Google Scholar). In addition, hypoxia induces the nuclear translocation of HIF-1α protein (6Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise mechanisms underlying this nuclear accumulation and its role in HIF-1α stabilization and activation have not yet been established. Nuclear targeting of the protein has been proposed as a regulatory step whereby HIF-1α escapes from proteasomal degradation (11Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 24Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poelinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, nuclear localization of HIF-1α has been shown to be essential, although not sufficient, for activation of the protein (6Kallio P.J. Okamoto K. O'Brien S. Carrero P. Makino Y. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6573-6586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar).In the current report, we provide evidence that PGE2 alone, under normoxic conditions, increases HIF-1α protein levels. In addition, PGE2 potentiates hypoxia-induced HIF-1α expression and nuclear localization. Moreover, inhibition of COX-2 activity significantly suppressed hypoxia-induced nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α protein, as demonstrated by Western blotting and a GFP-tagged HIF-1α system. Finally, PGE2 addition to meloxicam-treated cells restored the ability of hypoxia to induce HIF-1α nuclear accumulation, establishing a specific role for PGE2 in this process.We reported that PC-3ML cells express relatively high constitutive levels of COX-2 (21Liu X.H. Kirschenbaum A. Yao S. Stearns M.E. Holland J.F. Claffey K. Levine A.C. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 687-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) but not COX-1 (data not shown), suggesting that PGE2 production is mainly derived from COX-2 activity in this cell line. The selective COX-2 inhibitors decreased HIF-1α nuclear protein levels in PC-3ML cells under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Concomitant addition of PGE2 to meloxicam-treated hypoxic cells completely reversed the effects of the selective COX-2 inhibitor. In addition, we examined the possible effects of other PGs that are also derived from the COX-2-catalyzed pathway. Our results indicate that neither PGD2, PGI2, nor PGF2α significantly modulate HIF-1α protein expression or reverse the effects of the COX-2 inhibitors in PC-3ML cells (data not shown). These data support our conclusion that PGE2 production via the COX-2-catalyzed pathway specifically mediates hypoxic effects on HIF-1α protein in this cell line.Several reports demonstrated that hypoxia induces the phosphorylation of HIF-1α by p42/p44 MAPK (also called extracellular signal-regulated kinase, Erk1/2), which increases both HIF-1α nuclear localization and transcriptional activity (10Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar, 11Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

In addition, PGE2has been shown to enhance directly MAPK activity in colon cancer cells (26Sheng H.M. Shao M. Washington K.M. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18075-18081Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that hypoxia and PGE2, alone and in combination, promote the nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α protein. Both hypoxia and PGE2also induce a higher molecular weight HIF-1α band in the cytosol, which may represent an effect on post-translational modification, presumably phosphorylation, of the protein. This induction was blocked by PD98059 (a MAP kinase inhibitor) and COX-2 inhibitors. These results suggest that PGE2 induces phosphorylation of HIF-1α protein in the cytosol and imply that this phosphorylation, presumably by the MAP kinase (Erk1/2), is a prerequisite step for nuclear translocation of the protein and necessary for its stabilization. Consistent with these findings, COX inhibitors were recently shown to inhibit cancer cell growth and T cell activation by inhibiting the MAPK pathway (43Husain S.S. Szabo I.L. Pai R. Soreghan B.

Our data, however, demonstrate that LY294002, a potent PI3K inhibitor, completely inhibited basal expression patterns of HIF-1α protein but only partially inhibited the PGE2 effects on the protein. These results indicate an important role for PI3K/Akt pathway in the maintenance of basal HIF-1α protein expression but fail to demonstrate a specific role for PI3K/Akt in the PGE2-induced nuclear accumulation of HIF-1α protein.The effects of PGE2 are mediated through a specific family of transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (EP receptors) (25Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F12-F23PubMed Google Scholar). Three of the four EP receptor subtypes (EP2, EP3, and EP4) are expressed in PC-3ML cells. Our data indicate that both the EP2 and EP4 receptor subtypes mediate the observed PGE2 effects on HIF-1α regulation in this cell line.Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and second leading cause of cancer deaths in males in the United States. A number of clinical investigations have demonstrated a relationship between the degree of neovascularization and cancer grade (48Brawer M.K. Deering R.E. Brown M. Preston S.D. Bigler S.A.

Prostate cancer cells have been reported to overexpress COX-2 and produce elevated levels of PGE2(15Tjandrawinata R.R. Dahiya R. Hughes-Fulford M. Br. J.

In addition, this cell line is distinguished from other prostate cancer cell lines by its ability to dramatically up-regulate VEGF (5–6-fold) in response to cobalt chloride-simulated hypoxia, which is suppressed by a selective COX-2 inhibitor (21Liu X.H.

In the current report, we demonstrate further that PGE2 production via the COX-2-catalyzed pathway plays critical roles in the hypoxic regulation of HIF-1α in this cell line.Intratumoral hypoxia cannot be manipulated. Hypoxia regulates the expression of the α-subunit of HIF, the primary transcription factor involved in the hypoxic response. HIF induces the expression of genes essential for oxygen homeostasis and angiogenesis including VEGF, erythropoietin, tyrosine hydroxylase, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, and glycolytic enzymes. Our data demonstrate that selective COX-2 inhibitors prevents hypoxic up-regulation of HIF-1α in a human prostate cancer cell line. Given the seminal role of HIF-1α in the regulation of genes associated with cancer cell survival and tumor angiogenesis, our data provide a rationale for the use of COX-2 inhibitors as both anti-tumor and anti-angiogenic therapy in the treatment of prostate cancer. It is well established that all tumors require the growth of new blood vessels, a process termed angiogenesis, in order to grow beyond 1–2 mm, invade, and metastasize (1Folkman J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1992; 82: 4-7Crossref Scopus (4376) Google Scholar).

We previously found that the RyR2 is protein kinase A (PKA)-hyperphosphorylated in end-stage human heart failure. Because heart failure is a progressive disease that often evolves from hypertrophy, we analyzed the RyR2 macromolecular complex in several animal models of cardiomyopathy that lead to heart failure, including hypertrophy, and at different stages of disease progression. We now show that RyR2 is PKA-hyperphosphorylated in diverse models of heart failure and that the degree of RyR2 PKA phosphorylation correlates with the degree of cardiac dysfunction. Interestingly, we show that RyR2 PKA hyperphosphorylation can be lost during perfusion of isolated hearts due to the activity of the endogenous phosphatases in the RyR2 macromolecular complex. Moreover, infusion of isoproterenol resulted in PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in rat, indicating that systemic catecholamines can activate phosphorylation of RyR2 in vivo. These studies extend our previous analyses of the RyR2 macromolecular complex, show that both the kinase and phosphatase activities in the macromolecular complex are regulated physiologicallyin vivo, and suggest that RyR2 PKA hyperphosphorylation is likely a general feature of heart failure.

EC coupling in heart muscle converts electrical signals to mechanical ones via elevation of cytosolic calcium (Ca2+), which triggers contraction. The major components that regulate cardiac EC coupling are all modulated by activation of the sympathetic nervous system via phosphorylation by adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase (PKA). These include: 1) the triggers for EC coupling, predominantly Ca2+ influx through the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (dihydropyridine receptor) on the plasma membrane and possibly Ca2+ influx via the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger; 2) the SR Ca2+ release channel or type 2 ryanodine receptor (RyR2); and 3) the SR Ca2+ reuptake pump (SERCA2a) and its regulatory protein phospholamban (PLB). Although the roles of the sarcolemmal Ca2+ channel and PLB phosphorylation are well established, the physiological significance of RyR2 PKA phosphorylation is not yet fully understood. RyR2 is one of the largest known ion channels. Each RyR2 has an enormous cytoplasmic domain that serves as a scaffold for regulator proteins that modulate the channel's activity (1Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The RyR2 cytoplasmic scaffold domain contains highly conserved leucine/isoleucine zippers that bind to leucine/isoleucine zippers present in the adaptor/targeting proteins for kinases (PKA) and phosphatases (PP1 and PP2A) that regulate RyR channel function (1Marx S.O.

A 12.6-kDa isoform of FKBP12 (FKBP12.6) is tightly associated with RyR2 and modulates its function, possibly by enhancing cooperativity among its four subunits (4Jayaraman T. Brillantes A.-M.B.

So, in fact, RyR2 is a macromolecular complex containing kinases, phosphatases, and FKBP. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in response to stress, resulting in increased levels of local and circulating catecholamines that activate β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR), elevate intracellular cAMP, and activate PKA. PKA phosphorylation modulates RyR2 function both in vitro and in vivo (1Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J.

Channels from failing hearts have been shown to be PKA-hyperphosphorylated leading to dissociation of the FKBP12.6 and altered RyR2 channel function (14Marks A.R. Circ.

Thus, maladaptation of a classic physiological pathway (“fight or flight” that has never been subjected to evolutionary pressure, because heart failure is a new disease of the last century or two) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of heart failure, which is a chronic hyperadrenergic state (15Marks A.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 615-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 21Marks A.R. Reiken S. Marx S.O. Circulation. 2002; 105: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in failing hearts shifts the sensitivity of RyR2 to Ca2+ to the left (16Marx S.O.

If conditions lead to transient SR Ca2+ overload, then the SR Ca2+ leak during repolarization may contribute to “early after depolarizations” (EADs) and during diastole initiate “delayed after depolarizations” (DADs) by activating “transient inward currents” (22Lederer W.J. Tsien R.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1976; 263: 73-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). EADs and DADs can trigger fatal cardiac arrhythmias (e.g. ventricular tachycardia) (23Wit A.L. Rosen M.R. Am. Heart J. 1983; 106: 798-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Fozzard H.A. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1992; 87: 105-113PubMed Google Scholar, 25Pogwizd S.M.

How Ca2+ signaling pathways interact to produce alterations in the [Ca2+]i transient observed in heart failure is not well understood. Here we examine how RyR2 PKA phosphorylation is regulated and how this form of regulation may be linked to changes in RyR2 function. PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 also decreases coupled gating between RyR2 (26Marx S.O. Ondrias K. Marks A.R. Science. 1998; 281: 818-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 27Marx S.O.

Reduced coupled gating may lead to incomplete closure of RyR2 following activation (14Marks A.R. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 8-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 15Marks A.R. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 2001; 33: 615-624Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) that would tend to decrease SR Ca2+content. Administration of oral β-AR blockers reverses the PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2, restores normal stoichiometry of the RyR2 macromolecular complex, and restores normal single channel function in a canine model of heart failure (28Reiken S. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J., He, K.L. Prieto A. Becker E., Yi, G.H. Wang J. Burkhoff D. Marks A.R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2843-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here we analyze the RyR2 PKA phosphorylation and the RyR2 macromolecular complex in several models of heart failure, including hypertrophy that leads to heart failure, and at different stages of the disease. We now show that, in isolated perfused rodent hearts, inhibition of endogenous phosphatase activity results in a significant increase in PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in response to isoproterenol, indicating that phosphatases are indeed active in the RyR2 macromolecular complex in intact heart. Moreover, infusion of isoproterenol resulted in PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in rat, indicating that systemic catecholamines can activate phosphorylation of RyR2 in vivo. Using a rat model of myocardial infarction-induced heart failure, we demonstrate that RyR2 is PKA-hyperphosphorylated while in the same hearts phospholamban is PKA-hypophosphorylated. Using this model we further show that the RyR2 macromolecular complex is depleted of FKBP12.6 and PP1 and PP2A. RyR2 PKA hyperphosphorylation was also demonstrated in a murine model of cardiac-specific β2-AR overexpression confirming that the hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 is due to activated PKA. Moreover, a murine cardiomyopathy model in which cardiac dysfunction is associated with expression of collagenase in the heart also results in PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 that is progressive over time and correlates with the degree of cardiac dysfunction. These studies extend our previous studies on the RyR2 macromolecular complex and show that the both the kinase and phosphatase activities in the macromolecular complex can be regulated physiologically in vivo. Heart homogenates were prepared by homogenizing ∼1.0 g of cardiac tissue in 1.0 ml of a buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaF, 1.0 mm Na3VO4, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors. Samples were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 10 min. After determining the protein concentration, the supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C until use. RyR2 was immunoprecipitated from heart samples by incubating 500 μg of homogenate with anti-RyR antibody in 0.5 ml of a modified radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl, 5.0 mm NaF, 1.0 mmNa3VO4, 0.25% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added, incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, washed with 1× phosphorylation buffer (8 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 50 mm Tris/PIPES, pH 6.8), and resuspended in 10 μl of a 1.5× phosphorylation buffer containing either PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) or PKA plus a PKA inhibitor (PKI5–24, 500 nm, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Back-phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated RyR2 was initiated with 33 μm Mg-ATP containing 10% [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Boston, MA) and terminated after 8 min at room temperature with 5 μl of stop solution (4% SDS and 0.25m dithiothreitol). Samples were heated to 95 °C, size-fractionated on 6% SDS-PAGE, and RyR2 radioactivity was quantified using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuaNT software (AmershamBiosciences, Piscataway, NJ). Nonspecific phosphorylation (not inhibited by PKA inhibitor) was subtracted, and the resulting value was divided by the amount of RyR2 protein and expressed as the inverse of the PKA-dependent [γ-32P]ATP signal. Proteins were size-fractionated on 6% SDS-PAGE for RyR, 12% SDS-PAGE for RII, PKA, PP1, and PP2A, and 15% SDS-PAGE for phospholamban and FKBP12.6. Immunoblots were developed using Anti-RyR (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO, 1:3000 dilution in 5% milk-TBS-Tween), a phosphospecific phospholamban antibody (Cyclacel Limited, Dundee, Scotland, 1:5000 dilution in 5% milk-TBS-Tween), anti-RII (1:1000), anti-PKA catalytic subunit (1:1000), anti-PP1 (1:1000), anti-PP2A (Transduction Laboratories), and anti-FKBP (1:1000). Rats were anesthetized with a mixture of intraperitoneal 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylazine. Vessel cannulation was performed using a 2-cm longitudinal incision made below the mandible to the thoracic inlet. The left internal jugular vein was isolated and cannulated with an Intramedic PE-10 polyethylene catheter. Isoproterenol hydrochloride (0.2 mg/ml) was infused through the venous catheter at a rate ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/min until the mean arterial pressure decreased to 60% of baseline. Male Wistar rats (180–200 g) were used to produce myocardial infarction as described previously (29Alvarez J.L. Aimond F. Lorente P. Vassort G. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2000; 32: 1169-1179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, rats were anesthetized with a mixture of 150 mg/kg intraperitoneal ketamine and 15 mg/kg chlorpromazine. Respiration was maintained with a ventilation assist device and an endotracheal tube (3 ml air/60 strokes per minute). After median-left thoracotomy and pericardium opening, the left main coronary artery was occluded with a 7-0 silk suture at the most proximal point below the left atria appendage. Sham-operated rats were treated the same way but without coronary artery ligation. Animals were euthanized for experiments at 6-month post-ligation. Before they were euthanized, animals underwent hemodynamic measurements or echocardiography. Ventricular cardiac myocytes were isolated from control and PMI myocytes by standard enzymatic (collagenase Worthington type II, 1 mg/ml) methods. After isolation, cells from the left ventricular free wall (around the infarction) were stored in DEM media (1.8 mm CaCl2). The cells were loaded with the fluorescence Ca2+ dye Fluo-3 through the patch-clamp pipette. Data are shown as the ratio of measured fluorescence (F) over fluorescence min (F o). All images were acquired with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 confocal microscope fitted with an argon laser and processed with Bio-Rad SOM, COMOS, and IDL (Research Imaging Systems, Boulder, CO) software. Ca2+sparks were evoked by depolarizations to voltages close to the activation threshold of I Ca using an Axopatch 200A patch-clamp amplifier and recorded using pClamp 6.01 (Axon Instruments). Holding potential was −80 mV, then a ramp (500 ms) to −45 mV was applied to inactivate Na+ channels, and 200-ms depolarizations were applied in 2-mV steps until no individual sparks but a global [Ca2+]i transient was evoked. Series resistance was electronically compensated to 40–60%. Cells were superfused with an external solution containing (in mm) NaCl 135; MgCl2 1; CsCl 20; glucose 10; HEPES 10; CaCl2 1.8 (pH 7.4). When isoproterenol was used, 10 μm tetrodotoxin was used to block Na+ channels. Patch pipettes were filled with (in mm) CsCl 130; fluo-3 0.05; HEPES 10; MgCl20.33; triethanolamine-Cl 20; Mg-ATP 4 (pH 7.2). Temperature was maintained at 35–37 °C throughout each experiment. Briefly, male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing between 250 and 300 g were euthanized by lethal injection of pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg). The hearts were rapidly removed and perfused via the Langendorff method with Ca2+-free modified Tyrode's solution containing (mm) NaCl 137, KCl 5, HEPES 20, MgCl2 0.5, glucose 15, and NaH2PO4 1 with pH 7.4 at 37 °C for 5 min until the blood was washed out. Hearts were then perfused with 1 μm isoproterenol for 15 min or identical procedure in the complete absence of isoproterenol. The same procedure was repeated in the presence of 1 mm NaF during the whole perfusion (20 min) with or without isoproterenol (1 μm). Following perfusion, the heart ventricles were removed and quickly frozen (liquid nitrogen) until further use. Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) and Dahl salt-resistant (control, Dahl SR/Jr) rats were fed an 8% high salt diet from 6 weeks of age as described previously (30Gomez A.M. Valdivia H.H. Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Santana L.F. Cannell M.B. McCune S.A. Altschuld R.A. Lederer W.J. Science. 1997; 276: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). SS Dahl rats develop severe hypertension and concentric compensated hypertrophy over a period of weeks when fed a high salt diet, the SR/Jr strain do not develop hypertension or cardiac hypertrophy. After 8 weeks on diet the rats were sacrificed, and the hypertrophic hearts were perfused using the procedure described above with or without 1 mmNaF in the perfusate as indicated, except that no isoproterenol was added to the perfusion solution. Single channel recordings of RyR2 were performed and analyzed under voltage-clamp conditions as described previously (16Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). We used planar lipid bilayers consisting of 3:1 phosphatidylethanolamine:phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids, 20 mg/ml) formed across a 0.15-mm aperture in a polystyrene cup (Warner Instruments). SR membrane vesicles were added to the cis(cytoplasmic) side of the membrane and induced to fuse with the lipid bilayer by increasing KCl concentration to 800 mm. After incorporation of vesicles with channels to bilayer, the KCl gradient across the bilayer was eliminated by perfusion of the cischamber with cis solution. Solutions used for channel analysis were: trans solution, 250 mm Hepes, 53 mm Ca(OH)2, and 50 mm KCl (pH 7.4);cis solution, 250 mm HEPES, 125 mmTris, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmCaCl2 (pH 7.4). Free [Ca2+] (cis) 150 nm was calculated using CHELATOR software (31Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12 (876–9): 870-874PubMed Google Scholar). Thetrans chamber of the lipid bilayer was connected to the head-stage input of an Axopatch 200A amplifier (Axon Instruments) using an Ag/AgCl electrode and an agarose/KCl bridge. The cis side was held at ground with a similar electrode. The single-channel currents were filtered at 1 kHz with a four-pole Bessel filter (Warner Instruments) and digitized with a 4-kHz sampling frequency using a DigiData 1200 interface (Axon Instruments) with AxoScope1 software (Axon Instruments). At the conclusion of each experiment, ryanodine or ruthenium red were applied to confirm the identity of channels as RyR2. pClamp 6.0.3 software (Axon Instruments) was used for analyzing channel records. Open probability (P o) and open and closed dwell times were identified using a 50% threshold analysis from at least 2 min of continual records. To find mean dwell times (τi) and their proportions (area under the curve for each exponential distribution), the dwell time distributions were fitted using the Levenberg-Marquardt least-squares method with SigmaPlot 4.00 software (Jandel Scientific). Distributions were generated by pooling data for individual channels (n > 3) to get precise fitted parameters. The F test was employed for statistical comparisons of different kinetics models. Events shorter than 500 μs were excluded from analyses. Results are presented as mean ± S.D.; Student's t test or ANOVA (where indicated) was used for statistical analyses. The unpaired t test or Welcht test were used for statistical analysis. Mean dwell times are presented as the value of the fitted coefficient ± S.E. (S.E. represents the uncertainty in the estimates of the fitted coefficient). A p value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Given the strong evidence showing PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in heart failure as noted above (16Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R.

Marks A.R. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2843-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), it was initially hard to reconcile the findings of Gomez et al. (30Gomez A.M. Valdivia H.H. Cheng H. Lederer M.R. Santana L.F. Cannell M.B. McCune S.A. Altschuld R.A. Lederer W.J. Science. 1997; 276: 800-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) who reported that RyR2 function was normal in preparations obtained from animals in heart failure. To resolve this paradox, we explored the hypothesis that it may be necessary to prevent dephosphorylation of RyR2 by phosphatases to observe the PKA phosphorylated state of RyR2 in isolated cardiomyocytes. Fig. 1 A shows the result of an experiment that investigates this process. Phosphorylation of RyR2 and phospholamban (PLB) were examined. Langendorff perfusion of a control heart with isoproterenol (1 μm) only produced PKA phosphorylation of RyR2, if the weak phosphatase inhibitor NaF (1 mm) was present. NaF perfusion alone did not produce RyR2 phosphorylation. In contrast, PLB was phosphorylated by isoproterenol in the presence or absence of NaF. This finding suggests that studies performed on isolated cardiomyocytes that are harvested following a similar Langendorff perfusion do not accurately represent the phosphorylation status of RyR2 in the intact heart due to continuing activity of the bound phosphatases during the perfusion. In contrast, phospholamban, a small protein that does not have phosphatases and kinases targeted directly to it, is regulated differently from RyR2 with respect to phosphorylation and dephosphorylation in the isolated perfused heart. PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 leads to dissociation of FKBP12.6 from the channel resulting in altered RyR2 function. Therefore, it is important to test what, if any, changes in the macromolecular complex take place following the treatment of Langendorff-perfused control hearts with isoproterenol as shown in Fig. 1 A. To assess the effect of acute PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in an intact heart on the RyR2 macromolecular complex we immunoprecipitated the complex from the perfused rat hearts with an anti-RyR2 antibody and immunoblotted for components of the RyR2 macromolecular complex (Fig. 1 B). All of the components of the macromolecular complex are shown to remain at the same levels as in control (non-isoproterenol-treated) except FKBP12.6. FKBP12.6 was reduced by about 40% following perfusion with isoproterenol and NaF, but there was no significant reduction following perfusion by either isoproterenol or NaF alone. These findings are consistent with the depletion of FKBP12.6 from the RyR2 complex due to the PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in heart failure (16Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar). The notable difference between the acute PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 shown here and the longer-term PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 in heart failure are the reductions of the phosphatases PP1 and PP2A in heart failure (16Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar) that were not observed following acute PKA phosphorylation due to isoproterenol perfusion (Fig. 1 A). This finding suggests that the acute effect of isoproterenol-induced PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 is to deplete the complex of FKBP12.6. The reduction in phosphatase levels in the RyR2 macromolecular complex that we have observed in channels from failing hearts (16Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Jayaraman T. Burkhoff D. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. Cell. 2000; 101: 365-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar) represents a distinct effect of the chronic hyperadrenergic state of heart failure that is not completely recapitulated with acute perfusion with isoproterenol. An important question that needs to be addressed is whether or not RyR2s in the heart become PKA-phosphorylated following systemic infusion of isoproterenol in the intact animal? Infusion of isoproterenol hydrochloride (0.2 mg/ml) at a rate ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 ml/min was conducted until the mean arterial pressure decreased to 60% of baseline at which point the animals were sacrificed, and the hearts were excised and immediately flash-frozen so that there was no time for phosphatases bound to RyR2 to dephosphorylate the channel. Under these conditions isoproterenol infusion resulted in a significant increase in PKA phosphorylation of RyR2 (Fig. 1 C). Isoproterenol infusion reduced the amount of FKBP12.6 bound to the RyR2 complex but did not alter levels of PKA, RII, PP1, or PP2A (Fig. 1 D). Although both FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 are expressed in the heart, and FKBP12 is considerably more abundant than FKBP12.6, only FKBP12.6 co-immunoprecipitated with RyR2 (Fig. 1 E). These data provide compelling evidence that β-AR activation leads to RyR2 PKA phosphorylation and the dissociation of FKPB12.6. Investigation of the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation balance hypothesis to understand PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 in cardiac hypertrophy and failure requires use of more than one model.

The action of the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 complex requires both intracellular cAMP and Ca2+. Although Rim2 has C2domains, its role as a Ca2+ sensor has remained unclear. In the present investigation, we have discovered that Piccolo, a CAZ (cytoskeletal matrix associated with the activezone) protein in neurons that is structurally related to Rim2, also binds to cAMP-GEFII and that it forms both homodimer and heterodimer with Rim2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner, whereas Rim2 alone does not form the homodimer. The association of Piccolo·Rim2 heterodimerization is stronger than Piccolo·Piccolo homodimerization. Treatment of pancreatic islets with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against Piccolo inhibits insulin secretion induced by cAMP analog 8-bromo-cyclic AMP plus high glucose stimulation. These results suggest that Piccolo serves as a Ca2+ sensor in exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells and that the formation of a cAMP-GEFII·Rim2·Piccolo complex is important in cAMP-induced insulin secretion.

In neurons, the plasma membrane of the presynaptic compartment contains the so-called active zone, a specialized region where synaptic vesicles dock and fuse (2Landis D.M. J. Electron. Microsc. Technol. 1988; 10: 129-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 3Yorifuji H. Hirokawa N. J. Electron. Microsc. Technol. 1989; 12: 160-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The active zone is characterized ultrastructurally as an electron-dense region of cytoskeletal filaments under the plasma membrane where synaptic vesicles are clustered (4Gotow T. Miyaguchi K.

It is thought that the cytoskeletal matrix associated with the active zone (CAZ)1 plays a fundamental role in regulating the mobilization of synaptic vesicles and defining release sites (6Garner C.C.

Recent studies of the active zone in neurons have found that CAZ proteins include Piccolo/aczonin (7Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Takei K. Kindler S. Veh R.W. DeCamilli P.

Regulated exocytosis is a specialized feature of neurons and neuroendocrine and endocrine cells. These cells share various molecules that constitute the exocytotic machinery including SNARE proteins, synaptotagmins, and the members of the Rab3 subfamily (13Gerber S.H. Sudhof T.C. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S3-S11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the active zone is well characterized in neurons, it is less understood in neuroendocrine and endocrine cells (14Jacobsson G. Bean A.J. Scheller R.H. Juntti-Berggren L. Deeney J.T. Berggren P.O. Meister B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12487-12491Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The pancreatic β-cell is a typical endocrine cell in which exocytosis of the insulin-containing granules is regulated by a variety of factors. cAMP is a critical intracellular signal in the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells (15Malaisse W.J. Malaisse-Lagae F. Mayhew D. J. Clin. Invest. 1967; 46: 1724-1734Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The action of cAMP on insulin secretion generally has been thought to be mediated by phosphorylation of the many regulatory proteins by protein kinase A (16Kasai H. Suzuki T. Liu T.T. Kishimoto T. Takahashi N. Diabetes. 2002; 51: S19-S24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found recently that the cAMP-binding protein cAMP-GEFII (17Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar), also referred to as Epac2 (18deRooij J. Rehmann H. vanTriest M. Cool R.H.

Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), a target of the small G-protein Rab3, mediates cAMP-dependent, protein kinase A-independent insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells (20Kashima Y.

The action of the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 complex in insulin secretion requires increases in both intracellular cAMP and Ca2+ (20Kashima Y. Miki T Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, how cAMP and Ca2+ signals are integrated in this mechanism is not clear. Because Rims (Rim1 and Rim2) have C2 domains, it was initially postulated that the C2 domains of Rims function as a Ca2+ sensor in excitation-secretion coupling (10Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 19Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, recent studies indicate that Rim1 is not required for Ca2+-regulated synaptic fusion (21Koushika S.P. Richmond J.E. Hadwiger G. Weimer R.M. Jorgensen E.M. Nonet M.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 997-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 22Schoch S. Castillo P.E., Jo, T. Mukherjee K. Geppert M. Wang Y. Schmitz F. Malenka R.C. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 2002; 415: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), suggesting that another molecule is a Ca2+ sensor in the mechanism of cAMP-GEFII-mediated exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells. In the search for a molecule in addition to Rim2 that couples directly to cAMP-GEFII, we found that the CAZ protein Piccolo (7Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Takei K. Kindler S. Veh R.W. DeCamilli P. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar), which is structurally related to Rim2, also binds to cAMP-GEFII. We also found that Piccolo forms both the homodimer and heterodimer with Rim2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner and that the association of the Piccolo·Rim2 heterodimerization is stronger than that of the Piccolo·Piccolo homodimerization in the presence of Ca2+. Treatment of pancreatic islets with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) against Piccolo inhibited insulin secretion induced by cAMP analog 8-bromo-cyclic AMP (8-Br-cAMP) plus high glucose stimulation. We propose that Piccolo serves as a Ca2+ sensor in exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells and that the formation of the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2·Piccolo complex is important in the mechanism of cAMP-induced exocytosis. Yeast strain L40 (MATa trp1 leu2 his3 LYS2::lexA-HIS3 URA3::lexA-lacZ) was transformed with a derivative of pBTM116 bearing a full-length cAMP-GEFII fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain (pBTM116-cAMP-GEFII) using the lithium acetate method (23Beguin P. Nagashima K. Gonoi T. Shibasaki T. Takahashi K. Kashima Y. Ozaki N. Geering K. Iwanaga T. Seino S. Nature. 2001; 411: 701-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Strain L40 carrying pBTM116-cAMP-GEFII was transformed with the mouse insulin-secreting cell line MIN6 cDNA library. Approximately, 2 × 106 transformants were screened for growth on Yc plate medium (2% glucose, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 1% succinic acid, and 0.12% yeast nitrogen base) containing 0.5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole but lacking tryptophan, histidine, uracil, and leucine. Prey clones encoding a partial Piccolo (amino acid residues 4,505–4,758) were isolated. Approximately, 1 × 106 plaques of a MIN6 cDNA library were hybridized under low stringency conditions (24Kotake K. Ozaki N. Mizuta M. Sekiya S. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29407-29410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using a mouse partial Piccolo cDNA as probe. The protein-coding region was covered by five cDNA fragments. Northern blot analysis was performed under standard stringent hybridization conditions with 32P-labeled 1,089-bp Piccolo cDNA. Membranes were washed with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 60 min and exposed to x-ray film with intensifying screen at −80 °C.In situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (25Tanaka J. Murate M. Wang C.Z. Seino S. Iwanaga T. Arch. Histol. Cytol. 1996; 59: 485-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the antisense oligonucleotide probe corresponding to bases 14,900–14,944. GST fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Biosciences). For cosedimentation assays, COS-1 cells were transfected with each plasmid using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). The transfected cells were sonicated in buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for binding between cAMP-GEFII and Piccolo or in buffer B (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) for binding between C2 domains and cleared by centrifugation. This cellular lysate was incubated with GST fusion protein immobilized on glutathione-agarose for 90 min at 4 °C and washed extensively with each buffer four times. The material remaining on the resin was eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and subjected to immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation assay, cell lysate was incubated with anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then incubated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements were made using a Biacore 3000 (Uppsala, Sweden). Binding experiments were performed at 25 °C with a constant flow rate of 5 μl/min. The anti-GST antibodies were covalently coupled via primary amines to the carboxylmethylated dextran matrix according to the manufacturer's protocol (Biacore). GST alone or GST fusion proteins were then immobilized via high affinity binding to the anti-GST antibodies. The Myc-tagged C2A domain of Piccolo, which was expressed in COS-1 cells, was diluted in running buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and either 1 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA). Nonspecific binding of the Myc-tagged C2A domain of Piccolo to GST alone was evaluated in the same experiment by measuring binding to a surface, which was subtracted from each resonance measurement of GST fusion proteins. MIN6 cells were transfected with human preproinsulin expression vector pCMV-h preproinsulin plus pCMV-luciferase or pCMV-HA-Piccolo-PDZ (residues 3,900–4,244). Luciferase was used as a control. Three days after transfection, the C-peptide secretory response to 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm) in the presence of glucose (16.7 mm) for 60 min was assessed using a human C-peptide radioimmunoassay kit (Linco Research, St. Charles, MO). Insulin secretion was measured in isolated mouse pancreatic islets as described previously (20Kashima Y. Miki T Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The islets were treated for 96 h with 4 μm of antisense phosphorothioate-substituted ODNs (15-mers) against mouse Piccolo (the region corresponding to bases 2,452–2,466) or control ODNs (5′-AACGTAGTCACGTAG-3′). The antisense ODNs and control ODNs against Piccolo were designed and manufactured by Biognostik (Göttingen, Germany). The insulin secretory response to 8-Br-cAMP (1 mm) in the presence of high glucose concentration (16.7 mm) for 60 min was assessed. Mouse pancreatic islets were isolated by the collagenase-digestion method. Total RNA was prepared from mouse pancreatic islets and MIN6 cells. Transcriptional gene expressions from these cells were determined by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. All PCRs were performed using 35 cycles. PCR products were separated by electrophoresis, and all sequences were confirmed. Oligonucleotides used for PCR amplification of the following genes were as follows: Bassoon (450 bp), forward 5′-ATGGGCAACGAGGCCAGCCT-3′ and reverse 5′-AATTTTCCTCATTCTGGTGA-3′; Munc13–1 (559 bp), forward 5′-GCCATGTCGCTGCTCTGTGTGCGTGTTA-3′ and reverse 5′-CTGATAGTGCCGTTGATGAC-3′; CAST (1296 bp), forward 5′-ATGTCTCCCCTGAGGATTTC-3′ and reverse 5′-CGTTAAGGGCATTGACATCTGA-3′; prenylated rab acceptor-1 (558 bp), forward 5′-ATGGCGGCCCAGAAGGACCA-3′ and reverse 5′-TGCAGATGGAACCTGTGTAA-3′; Profilin1 (423 bp), forward 5′-ATGGCCGGGTGGAACGCCTA-3′ and reverse 5′-TGCGGCGTTCCCAGTACTGA-3′; Profilin2 (423 bp), forward 5′-ATGGCCGGTTGGCAGAGCTA-3′ and reverse 5′-TGAGAGACTCTGGGTTCTAG-3′; Rim-BP1 (691 bp), forward 5′-GTAGGAAGGCCCAGGGGACC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCTGATTCATTCTGCTGCCC-3; Rim-BP2 (570 bp), forward 5′-ATGTCCCCAAACCCAGACGC-3′ and reverse 5′-GTGTTCATTTCACACCCTAA-3′; and Liprin-α (432 bp), forward 5′-TGCCGACCATTAGTGAAGCA-3′ and reverse 5′-AC- TGTTTGAACACCACAAAG-3′. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with a full-length cAMP-GEFII as bait (19Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). The screening of MIN6 cDNA led to the isolation of partial Piccolo/aczonin (Piccolo) as well as Rim2. To obtain full-length PICCOLO cDNA, we screened a MIN6 cDNA library with the partial Piccolo (residues 4,505–4,758) isolated by two-hybrid screen as a probe (Fig. 1 A). Two variants were isolated from the MIN6 cDNA library referred to asPICCOLO-long form (PICCOLO-L) andPICCOLO-short form (PICCOLO-S) (Fig. 1 A). Piccolo-L has two C2 domains (C2A and C2B domains) in the carboxyl terminus, whereas Piccolo-S lacks the C2B domain. Similar variants are expressed in mouse brain (8Wang X. Kibschull M. Laue M.M. Lichte B. Petrasch-Parwez E. Kilimann M.W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The mouse Piccolo-L and Piccolo-S sequence data have been submitted to GenBankTM data base under accession numbers AB083477 and AB083478, respectively. There is 93.7% amino acid identity between rat Piccolo-L and mouse Piccolo-L. The lysate of COS-1 cells transfected with FLAG-tagged cAMP-GEFII was incubated with GST-tagged partial Piccolo (amino acid residues 4,505–4,758) (Fig. 1 A). This partial Piccolo bound to FLAG-tagged cAMP-GEFII (data not shown). We then investigated to find whether the PDZ domain of Piccolo (Pic-PDZ) binds directly to cAMP-GEFII. GST-tagged Pic-PDZ bound to Myc-tagged cAMP-GEFII transfected in COS-1 cells (Fig. 1 B). The binding of cAMP-GEFII to Piccolo was further confirmed using COS-1 cells cotransfected with Myc-tagged cAMP-GEFII and HA-tagged Pic-PDZ, indicating that cAMP-GEFII specifically binds to the PDZ domain of Piccolo. Northern blot analysis revealed that Piccolo is expressed at high levels in cerebrum, cerebellum, and MIN6 cells and at moderate levels in pituitary gland, pancreatic islets, and pheochromocytoma-derived PC12 cells (Fig. 2 A). In situhybridization of mouse brain revealed that Piccolo mRNA is expressed in cerebral cortex, hippocampus (especially CA3 and dentate gyrus), olfactory bulb, cerebellar cortex, and pituitary gland (Fig. 2 B). The distribution of Piccolo mRNA largely overlaps with that of cAMP-GEFII and Rim mRNAs in tissues, cell lines, and mouse brain (19Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). C2 domains found in Ca2+-binding proteins such as synaptotagmins are involved in Ca2+-dependent homodimerization and heterodimerization (26Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 1-11Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The dimerization of synaptotagmins through their C2 domains has been shown to be important for Ca2+-induced exocytosis (27Littleton J.T. Serano T.L. Rubin G.M. Ganetzky B. Chapman E.R. Nature. 1999; 400: 757-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We investigated to find whether the C2 domains of Piccolo dimerize in the presence of Ca2+. The constructs used are shown in Figs.1 A and 3 A. The GST-tagged C2A or C2B domain of Piccolo (Pic-C2A or Pic-C2B) was incubated with lysate of COS-1 cells transfected with Myc-tagged C2A domain of Piccolo in the presence or absence of Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the C2A domain of Piccolo homodimerizes in the presence of Ca2+ but does not bind to the C2B domain of Piccolo. We also found that the C2B domain of Piccolo does not homodimerize in the presence of Ca2+ (data not shown). In addition, full-length Rim2 does not bind to either the C2A or C2B domain of Rim2 in the presence of Ca2+, indicating that Rim2 does not homodimerize. We then determined whether the C2 domains of Rim2 bind to the C2A or C2B domain of Piccolo in a Ca2+-dependent manner. GST-tagged Pic-C2A or Pic-C2B was incubated with the lysate of COS-1 cells transfected with full-length Rim2. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the C2A domain of Piccolo binds to full-length Rim2 predominantly in the presence of Ca2+, whereas the C2B domain of Piccolo does not. To identify the region of Rim2 that binds to the C2A domain of Piccolo, GST-tagged Pic-C2A or Pic-C2B was incubated with the lysate of COS-1 cells transfected with Rim2 mutant lacking both C2A and C2B domains (Rim2ΔC2). There was no interaction between Pic-C2A and Rim2ΔC2, indicating that the C2A domain of Piccolo binds to the C2A or the C2B domain of Rim2 or both (Fig. 3 C). We then investigated Pic-C2A binding to Rim2-C2A or Rim2-C2B. The GST-tagged C2A domain of Rim2 binds to Myc-tagged Pic-C2A in the presence of Ca2+, whereas the C2B domain of Rim2 does not (Fig. 4 D). These results suggest that the C2A domain of Piccolo is involved in Ca2+-dependent dimerization with the C2A domain of Piccolo or the C2A domain of Rim2. To compare the effects of Ca2+ on the association between Pic-C2A·Pic-C2A homodimerization and Pic-C2A·Rim2-C2A heterodimerization, we employed SPR spectroscopy. Anti-GST antibodies were covalently coupled on a sensor chip, and then GST alone, GST-tagged Pic-C2A, or GST-tagged Rim2-C2A was immobilized. The resonance units of GST alone or GST fusion proteins for anti-GST antibodies were nearly equal (data not shown), indicating that the anti-GST antibodies were equally saturated by GST and GST fusion proteins. The lysate of COS-1 cells transfected with Myc-tagged Pic-C2A was perfused across the sensor chip on which GST alone or GST-fused C2A domain was immobilized. The association of Pic-C2A with Pic-C2A or Rim2-C2A was confirmed by using SPR spectroscopy (Fig. 4 A). The resonance units of the association between Pic-C2A and Rim2-C2A (heterodimerization) were twice as high as those of homodimerization of Pic-C2A (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the association between the C2A domain of Piccolo and Rim2 (heterodimerization) is stronger than that of homodimerization of the C2A domain of Piccolo (Fig. 4 B). To determine whether the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2·Piccolo complex forms in the presence of Ca2+, FLAG-tagged cAMP-GEFII and Myc-tagged Rim2 were coexpressed in COS-1 cells and the lysate was incubated with GST-tagged Pic-C2A in the presence of Ca2+. As shown in Fig. 5, the C2A domain of Piccolo binds to the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 complex in the presence of Ca2+ but not to cAMP-GEFII directly. Because cAMP-GEFII binds to the PDZ domain of Piccolo and mediates cAMP-induced exocytosis, we investigated to find whether Piccolo is involved in cAMP-GEFII in exocytosis. We examined the effect of the PDZ domain of Piccolo on 8-Br-cAMP-induced exocytosis from MIN6 cells in which endogenous cAMP-GEFII and Piccolo are expressed. The PDZ domain of Piccolo was cotransfected with human preproinsulin in MIN6 cells. Because preproinsulin is converted into insulin and C-peptide during the secretory process in pancreatic β-cells and antibody against human insulin cross-react with endogenous mouse insulins (I and II), we monitored insulin secretion indirectly by measuring human C-peptide secretion from transfected cells. We previously showed that overexpression of Rim2ΔA, which contains only a PDZ domain and lacks zinc finger and C2 domains, with human preproinsulin in MIN6 cells suppressed 8-Br-cAMP-induced C-peptide secretion (19Ozaki N. Shibasaki T. Kashima Y. Miki T. Takahashi K. Ueno H. Sunaga Y. Yano H. Matsuura Y. Iwanaga T. Takai Y. Seino S. Nat.

The overexpression of the PDZ domain of Piccolo in MIN6 cells significantly suppressed 8-Br-cAMP-induced secretion of C-peptide in the presence of 16.7 mm glucose compared with controls transfected with luciferase (Fig. 6 A). These results indicate that the interaction between cAMP-GEFII and Piccolo is involved in cAMP-induced exocytosis. To clarify the physiological relevance of Piccolo, we investigated the role of endogenous Piccolo on insulin secretion. We utilized antisense ODNs against Piccolo in mouse pancreatic islets. We first ascertained whether treatment with antisense ODNs suppresses Piccolo at the protein level. Because anti-Piccolo antibody that can detect endogenous Piccolo is not available, we constructed partial Piccolo cDNA containing the recognition site for antisense ODN against Piccolo. COS-1 cells transfected with partial Piccolo were treated with antisense ODNs against Piccolo or control ODNs. Treatment with antisense ODNs markedly decreased the partial Piccolo protein level in transfected cells (Fig. 6 B). We then evaluated the effect of antisense ODNs on 8-Br-cAMP-induced insulin secretion at high glucose (16.7 mm) from mouse pancreatic islets as described previously (20Kashima Y. Miki T Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). 8-Br-cAMP-induced insulin secretion at high glucose was reduced significantly in the presence of antisense ODNs against Piccolo compared with treatment with control ODNs (Fig. 6 C). These results indicate that Piccolo is involved in exocytosis induced by 8-Br-cAMP in pancreatic islets. In neurons, CAZ proteins (Piccolo, Bassoon, Rim1, Munc13-1, and CAST) and CAZ-associated proteins (prenylated rab acceptor-1, Profilin1, Profilin2, Rim-binding proteins (RIM-BP1 and RIM-BP2), and Liprin-α) are known to form multiple protein complexes at the active zone (12Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Sato K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). All of these proteins with the exception of CAST and RIM-BP1 are expressed in pancreatic islets and MIN6 cells as assessed by RT-PCR analysis (TableI).Table ImRNA expression of CAZ and CAZ-associated proteinsMouse pancreatic isletsMIN6 cellsCAZ proteins Piccolo1-aExpression was determined by Northern blot analysis (in this study).++ Bassoon++ Rim21-bExpression was determined by Northern blot analysis (19).++ Munc13–1++ CAST−+CAZ-associated proteins PRA1++ Profilin1++ Profilin2++ RIM-BP1−− RIM-BP2++ Liprin−α++mRNA expressions were determined by RT-PCR analysis.

We recently showed that the cAMP-binding protein cAMP-GEFII interacting with Rim2 participates in cAMP-dependent, protein kinase A-independent exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells (19Ozaki N.

Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The action of the cAMP-GEFII·Rim2 complex in this process in pancreatic β-cells requires a rise in Ca2+ concentration as well as a rise in cAMP concentration (20Kashima Y. Miki T Shibasaki T. Ozaki N. Miyazaki M. Yano H. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46046-46053Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It is previously reported (28Siegel E.G. Wollheim C.B. Kikuchi M. Renold A.E. Sharp G.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) also that cAMP induces insulin secretion in the presence of a high Ca2+ concentration but not in the presence of cAMP alone. These findings indicate that cAMP-induced insulin secretion in the mechanism of cAMP-dependent exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells is Ca2+-dependent. Although Rim2 has C2 domains, it has remained unclear how Rim2 functions as a Ca2+ sensor. During the search for molecules interacting with cAMP-GEFII in MIN6 cells, we found that Piccolo binds directly to cAMP-GEFII. Similar to Rim1 (10Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), Piccolo in neurons is a CAZ protein (7Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Takei K. Kindler S. Veh R.W. DeCamilli P. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, Piccolo and Rim1 are structurally similar in that they have zinc finger domain(s), a PDZ domain, and C2domains (7Cases-Langhoff C. Voss B. Garner A.M. Appeltauer U. Takei K. Kindler S. Veh R.W. DeCamilli P. Gundelfinger E.D. Garner C.C. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 69: 214-223PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wang Y. Okamoto M. Schmitz F. Hofmann K. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 388: 593-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). C2 domains found in Ca2+-binding proteins are thought to be involved in Ca2+-dependent homodimerization or heterodimerization (26Chapman E.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 1-11Crossref Scopus (378) Google Scholar). For example, the dimerization of synaptotagmins through their C2 domain is important in their Ca2+-sensing function in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis (28Siegel E.G. Wollheim C.B. Kikuchi M. Renold A.E. Sharp G.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 65: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the homodimerization and heterodimerization of Piccolo and Rim2. We found that Rim2 cannot form homodimer, whereas Piccolo can form both homodimer and heterodimer with Rim2 in a Ca2+-dependent manner. These results are consistent with previous reports that putative Ca2+binding sites in the C2A domain of Piccolo are similar to those in the C2A domain of synaptotagmin 1 and that the C2 domains of Rim1 lack canonical aspartate residues involved in putative Ca2+ binding sites (29Ubach J. Zhang X. Shao X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3921-3930Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 30Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1605-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The association of the Piccolo·Rim2 complex is stronger than that of the Piccolo·Piccolo complex in the presence of Ca2+ as assessed by SPR spectroscopy. Considering these findings together, it is probable that Piccolo rather than Rim2 functions as a Ca2+ sensor in the mechanism of cAMP-induced exocytosis in pancreatic β-cells. The properties of the complex of cAMP-GEFII, Rim2, and Piccolo such as the stoichiometry are unclear at present. It has been suggested that Piccolo is an unusual Ca2+ sensor with Ca2+ affinity (K d, ∼1.5 mm) too low to trigger release in neurons but ideally suited for a such a role in Ca2+ accumulation through repetitive stimulation (30Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1605-1619Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It is known that the rise in [Ca2+]i elicited during stimulation by cAMP plus high glucose in pancreatic β-cells is not transient but is sustained (31Rorsman P. Eliasson L. Renstrom E. Gromada J. Barg S. Gopel S. News Physiol. Sci. 2000; 15: 72-77PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting the accumulation of [Ca2+]iduring the stimulation. Indeed, the treatment of pancreatic islets with antisense ODNs against Piccolo significantly inhibited insulin secretion induced by 8-Br-cAMP plus high glucose. This is compatible with the function of Piccolo as a Ca2+ sensor in cAMP-induced exocytosis of insulin granules. Several isoforms of synaptotagmins, which are thought to serve as a Ca2+ sensor for fast Ca2+-triggered release in neurons, also are expressed in pancreatic β-cells (32Gut A. Kiraly C.E. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K Wollheim C.B. Lang J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1709-1716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that Piccolo and synaptotagmins function as distinct Ca2+sensors in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis of insulin granules in pancreatic β-cells, responding to different stimuli. It also is possible that the heterodimerization of Piccolo and Rim2 might alter the Ca2+ affinity of Piccolo according to SPR spectroscopy results. Recently, a model for the calcium microdomain has been proposed in neurons (33Naraghi M. Neher E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6961-6973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Ca2+ concentration has been calculated to reach millimolar order in a subcellular region proximal to the Ca2+ channel site (33Naraghi M. Neher E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6961-6973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested thatl-type Ca2+ channels colocalize with insulin-containing secretory granules in mouse pancreatic β-cells (34Bokvist K. Eliasson L. Ammala C. Renstrom E. Rorsman P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The K(K/R)(K/R)T sequence in the C2 domains of Rim1 and synaptotagmin 1 that bind to the α1-subunits of the Ca2+ channels (35Coppola T. Magnin-Luthi S. Perret-Menoud V. Gattesco S. Schiavo G. Regazzi R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32756-32762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) also is conserved in the C2B domain of Piccolo. This suggests that Piccolo is associated with the putative calcium microdomain in pancreatic β-cells. In neurons, CAZ proteins (Piccolo, Bassoon, Rim1, Munc13-1, and CAST) have been characterized and implicated in forming multiple protein complexes at the active zone (12Ohtsuka T. Takao-Rikitsu E. Inoue E. Inoue M. Takeuchi M. Matsubara K. Deguchi-Tawarada M. Sato K. Morimoto K. Nakanishi H. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 577-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). All of the CAZ proteins and CAZ-associated proteins in neurons are expressed in pancreatic islets and MIN6 cells with the exception of CAST in pancreatic islets judged from RT-PCR analysis (35 cycles) of pancreatic islets and MIN6 cells (Table I), although it cannot be excluded the possibility that isoform(s) of CAST is expressed in pancreatic islets (36Wang Y. Liu X. Biederer T. Sudhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14465-14469Google Scholar). These results suggest that the active zone also is a feature of pancreatic β-cells. Further biochemical and morphological studies are necessary to establish the fundamental structure and molecular basis of the exocytotic machinery of pancreatic β-cells as typical large dense core vesicle-containing endocrine cells.

DDM1 is a member of the broad SWI2/SNF2 protein family. Because of its phylogenetic position, DDM1 has been speculated to act as a chromatin-remodeling factor. Here we used a purified recombinant DDM1 protein to investigate whether it can remodel chromatin in vitro. We show that DDM1 is an ATPase stimulated by both naked and nucleosomal DNA. DDM1 binds to the nucleosome and promotes chromatin remodeling in an ATP-dependent manner. Specifically, it induces nucleosome repositioning on a short DNA fragment. The enzymatic activity of DDM1 is not affected by DNA methylation. The relevance of these findings to the in vivorole of DDM1 is discussed.

One broad group of mechanisms involves a battery of the enzymes that covalently modify histones and DNA (8Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7666) Google Scholar, 9Imhof A. Becker P.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 17: 1-13Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cheung P. Allis C.D. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 2000; 103: 263-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Specific regulatory factors recognize the modification status of chromatin fibers and render the structure active or inactive (8Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7666) Google Scholar). To ensure sufficient structural flexibility of the chromatin, the cell employs a specialized class of multiprotein complexes, which utilize the energy of ATP hydrolysis to change chromatin folding in the poorly understood process of “chromatin remodeling” (11Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 12Becker P.B. Horz W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Central to this activity are SWI2/SNF2-type ATPases that form the catalytic core of these remodeling complexes. The SWI2/SNF2 protein family falls within the large superfamily of DEXD/H-ATPases (13Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). The distinctive signature of the SWI2/SNF2 family is the SNF2_N domain, a variant of the typical DEXD/H domain that contains a well conserved C-terminal extension of ∼100 amino acids. 1Seehttp://pfam.wustl.edu/cgi-bin/getdesc?name=SNF2_N.Phylogenetic analysis divides the SWI2/SNF2 family into a number of subfamilies (13Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar), which appear to be present in all major taxa. Outside the SNF2_N and HelicC domains, which form the catalytic module, these subfamilies are not well conserved. Members of three closely related subfamilies (ISWI, Mi2/CHD, and SWI2/SNF2) have been shown to serve as the catalytic subunits of chromatin-remodeling complexes (15Corona D.F. Langst G. Clapier C.R.

Recently, remodeling activity has also been demonstrated for a complex built around the more distantly related INO80 ATPase (19Shen X. Mizuguchi G. Hamiche A. Wu C. Nature. 2000; 406: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). All catalytic subunits of the chromatin-remodeling complexes that have been analyzed can act outside the complex context, although they require associated proteins to achieve their full activity (16Brehm A.

During recent years it has become clear that energy-dependent remodelers act in concert with histone modifying enzymes (22Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L.

At least one of them, MOT1, acts as a transcriptional repressor that regulates TATA binding protein binding to promoters (28Auble D.T. Wang D. Post K.W. Hahn S. Mol. Cell.

The members of two SWI2/SNF2-type subfamilies, ATRX and DDM1, are involved in the control of DNA methylation status (34Gibbons R.J. McDowell T.L. Raman S. O'Rourke D.M. Garrick D. Ayyub H. Higgs D.R.

DDM1 belongs to a small protein family conserved in plants (A. thaliana DDM1, NCBI accession number AAD28303 ; Zea mays, NCBI AAL73042 ), fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiaeYfr038wp, NCBI NP_116696; Aspergillus fumigatus, NCBICAD28443 ), and mammals (Mus musculuslymphocyte-specific helicase, NCBI NP_032260 and Homo sapiens proliferation-associated SNF2-like gene, NCBI AAF82262 ). No genes encoding DDM1-like proteins have been found in the two fully sequenced invertebrate genomes. Evolutionary analysis places the DDM1 subfamily close to ISWI and SNF2/SWI2 groups (43Verbsky M.L. Richards E.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). 2J. Brzeski, manuscript in preparation. It is presently unclear how DDM1 acts to maintain DNA methylation status, although it has been speculated that it could remodel chromatin structure to facilitate the access of DNA methylases to the substrate (35Jeddeloh J.A. Stokes T.L. Richards E.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). However, the remodeling activity of DDM1 has not been analyzed, and this hypothesis is based solely on the phylogenetic position of the DDM1 subfamily. To address the above issue we have expressed recombinant DDM1 and characterized its biochemical activities. We find that DDM1 is an ATPase stimulated by both naked and nucleosomal DNA. It binds to nucleosomes and promotes nucleosome repositioning in an ATP-dependent manner. Our data indicate that DDM1 defines a novel class of chromatin-remodeling factors. Remarkably, considering its apparent function in the nucleus, we find that DDM1 activity is not affected by DNA methylation status. The DDM1 cDNA was amplified by PCR and cloned into the pFAST BAC 1 vector (Invitrogen) cleaved with BamHI and SalI sites. The 3′ primer contained a DNA sequence encoding a hexahistidine tag. The PCR product encoded a DDM1 fusion protein carrying a C-terminal His tag. The sequence of this fragment was verified by DNA sequencing. After transfection and amplification, the recombinant virus was used to infect SF21 insect cells. Three days after infection, the cells were collected, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.8, 300 mm KCl, 5 mm imidazole,10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40). After homogenization cellular debris were removed by centrifugation, and the extract was applied to a nickel-agarose column. The resin was washed extensively with homogenization buffer containing 25 mm imidazole. Bound proteins were then eluted with the buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Further purification and imidazole removal were achieved by gel filtration chromatography. Purity was estimated to be about 90% by SDS-PAGE. The protein identity was confirmed by mass fingerprinting using a QTof (Micromass) spectrometer. The preparation was tested for contaminating nuclease activity. To exclude any effect of contaminants, a “mock” preparation was made using uninfected cells. This preparation was tested in all experiments and did not show any activity in either the enzymatic or band-shift assays. For the initial ATPase assays, pBR322 plasmid DNA was used. Chromatin was reconstituted on the pBR322 DNA by the salt dialysis method using purified chicken erythrocyte histones (44von Holt C. Brandt W.F. Greyling H.J. Lindsey G.G. Retief J.D. Rodrigues J.de A. Schwager S. Sewell B.T. Methods Enzymol. 1989; 170: 431-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Assembly quality was verified by micrococcal nuclease digestion. For nucleosome mobility assay, mononucleosomes were assembled on a 248-bp fragment of mouse rDNA (45Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The DNA was labeled with 32P by PCR. After gel purification, the PCR products were converted into nucleosomes by the addition of core histones and salt dialysis. Different ratios of DNA to histones were used, and reconstitution products were analyzed by electromobility gel-shift assay to reveal the optimal conditions for nucleosome assembly. For nucleosome mobility assays, nucleosomes positioned on specific DNA sequences were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel and purified (45Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For assays involving DNA methylation, the 210-bpClaI fragment of the A. thaliana FWA promoter was used (positions 1287–1496 of NCBI accession number AF178688). DNA was methylated with SssI DNA methylase (New England Biolabs), and methylation was confirmed by digestion withFnu4HI. Labeling of DNA and the optimization of nucleosome assembly conditions were performed as described above. Free or nucleosomal DNA (15 fmol) was incubated with purified DDM1 (1–50 fmol) in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol at 15 °C for 20 min. The reaction products were then separated by electrophoresis on a 1.3% agarose gel and visualized with PhosphorImager. The reactions were performed in buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mmNaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Ten fmol of recombinant DDM1 were incubated with 100 ng of free or nucleosomal DNA in the presence of 66 μm ATP and a trace amount of [γ-32P]ATP. After a 60-min incubation at 25 °C, 1-μl samples were spotted onto polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates, and the reaction products were separated from nonhydrolyzed ATP by thin layer chromatography. For kinetic analysis, the samples were incubated with ATP at concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 μm for 30 min. Spots were quantified with a Storm PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics). The nucleosome mobility assay was performed essentially as described by Laengst et al.(45Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Gel-purified nucleosomes (60 fmol) were incubated with recombinant DDM1 (1–50 fmol) in the ATPase buffer containing 1 mm ATP for 1 h at 25 °C in a final volume of 10 μl. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 500 ng of competing plasmid DNA and further incubation for 10 min. Nucleosomes were then separated by native gel electrophoresis on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris acetate EDTA buffer. Gel-resolved bands were visualized with the PhosphorImager. Sequence analysis of proteins of the DDM1 family did not reveal any known domain that might be implicated in DNA or nucleosome recognition. Therefore, it was necessary to determine whether DDM1 itself can bind to its potential substrates, naked DNA, or nucleosomes. To this end purified, recombinant DDM1 was used in band-shift assays with short fragments of DNA and with in vitro assembled mononucleosomes. To produce sufficient quantities of DDM1 protein, a recombinant baculovirus expressing A. thaliana DDM1 was constructed and used to infect SF21 cells. The expressed DDM1 protein was isolated and found to be ∼90% pure (Fig. 1 A). A 248-bp fragment of mouse rDNA was amplified by PCR and used as free DNA or in a form of mononucleosomes assembled with purified chicken core histones. A band-shift assay with DDM1 and free DNA demonstrated the formation of nonspecific DNA-protein complexes (Fig. 1 B). Increasing the protein concentration resulted in a smearing pattern, indicating the binding at the multiple sites. In contrast, the interaction of DDM1 with the mononucleosomes resulted in the formation of one distinct shifted band (Fig. 1 C), indicating the production of one bound species. Despite these differences in the nature of the complexes formed, band-shift assay showed that DDM1 binds to both targets with similar affinity. Although SWI2/SNF2-type chromatin-remodeling ATPases occurin vivo in multi-protein complexes, all of the enzymes analyzed thus far display ATPase activity in the absence of other subunits. To examine the activity of purified DDM1 protein, the ATPase assays were performed in the presence of core histones, plasmid DNA, or plasmid-assembled chromatin (Fig. 2 A). Buffer was used as reference. To exclude any effect of potential contaminants, the mock preparation from uninfected cells was assayed in parallel reactions. To optimize the assay, DDM1 activity was analyzed under a broad spectrum of different conditions. The optimal reaction conditions were a buffer of pH 8.0 containing 50 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mmMgCl2 and a temperature of 25 °C. In such a reaction ATPase activity of DDM1 was clearly stimulated by free DNA. Very little additional stimulation was seen in the presence of an equivalent amount of DNA assembled into chromatin. The addition of core histones had no effect on the DDM1 activity. These findings are consistent with the results of band-shift assays and imply that interaction with both DNA and nucleosomes stimulates the ATPase activity to similar levels. To understand how DNA and nucleosomes stimulate the ATPase of DDM1, a kinetic analysis of the ATP hydrolysis reaction was performed. A time course of the ATP hydrolysis showed that the reaction is linear for 90 min (data not shown). To ensure linearity of the reaction, the assays were stopped after 30 min. The velocities of the ATP hydrolysis by recombinant DDM1 in the absence or presence of DNA or nucleosomes were determined by titrating with ATP (Fig. 2 B). The maximal velocity (V max) and the Michaelis-Menten constant (K m) were then determined by curve fitting and double-reciprocal plot (Fig. 2 C). BothV max and K m of ATP hydrolysis by recombinant DDM1 were higher than the corresponding values determined for the isolated Mi2α-remodeling ATPase (17Wang H.B. Zhang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), although they were of the same order of magnitude (TableI). The analysis revealed that DNA and nucleosomes increased the V max 2.9- and 3.1-fold, respectively, and the K m only 1.2-fold. Because V max measures the turnover number, our data indicate that both cofactors stimulate the ATPase of DDM1 mainly by increasing its turnover number while changing the affinity of DDM1 to ATP only slightly.Table IKinetic parameters of ATP hydrolysis by different chromatin remodeling factorsFactorCofactorK m(μm)V max (no.

Open table in a new tab The interaction with mononucleosomes and the stimulation of ATPase activity by nucleosomal DNA suggested that DDM1 could be a chromatin-remodeling factor. To address this issue directly a well established sliding assay, which measures the movement of a histone octamer along a short DNA fragment, was used (45Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The histone octamers were deposited on a 248-bp rDNA fragment. Gel electrophoresis of the assembled products revealed two discrete species (Fig. 3 A) that correspond to nucleosomes positioned at the center or at the end of the DNA fragment (45Langst G. Bonte E.J. Corona D.F. Becker P.B. Cell. 1999; 97: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Positioned nucleosomes were gel-purified and incubated with increasing amounts of DDM1 protein. DDM1 was able to induce, in an ATP-dependent manner, the redistribution of the histone octamer (Fig. 3 B). DDM1 was found to move nucleosomes from the end to the center of the DNA fragment with much greater efficiency than in the opposite direction. DDM1 is involved in the maintenance of CpG DNA methylation in vivo (36Kakutani T. Jeddeloh J.A. Richards E.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to see whether DNA methylation would affect the activity of recombinant DDM1 in in vitro assays. To this end DDM1 activity was compared in the ATPase assay performed with nucleosomes assembled on methylated and on non-methylated DNA. We decided to use an ATPase assay since it gives the most quantitative and directly comparable results. A fragment of A. thaliana FWA gene promoter was used because it contains a high number of CpG sequences (18 methylcytosines in a 210-bp-long DNA fragment) and has been shown to undergo demethylation in ddm1 mutant plants (40Soppe W.J. Jacobsen S.E. Alonso-Blanco C. Jackson J.P. Kakutani T. Koornneef M. Peeters A.J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 791-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The DNA was amplified by PCR and methylated with SssI methylase. The efficiency of DNA methylation was checked by cleavage with the restriction enzymeFnu4HI, which is sensitive to methylation of its recognition sequence (Fig. 4 A). Methylated and non-methylated FWA fragments were then used in ATPase assays as both free and nucleosomal DNA. This experiment showed that there was no influence of DNA methylation on the ATPase activity of DDM1 (Fig. 4 B). The SWI2/SNF2 protein family falls within the DEXD/H superfamily of ATPases. It is defined by the SNF2_N domain, a variant of DEXD/H-ATPase domain that contains an additional conserved region of about 100 amino acids extending C-terminally to the classical DEXD/H domain.1 Based on phylogenetic analysis the SWI2/SNF2 family can be divided into several subfamilies that share the SNF2_N and HelicC domains but are not well conserved outside these regions (13Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar).2 Chromatin-remodeling activity has been demonstrated for proteins of the closely related SWI2/SNF2, ISWI, and Mi2 subfamilies (15Corona D.F. Langst G. Clapier C.R. Bonte E.J. Ferrari S. Tamkun J.W. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 16Brehm A. Langst G. Kehle J.

Biol. 2000; 20: 6380-6389Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently the proteins of two other more distant subfamilies, INO80 and ERCC6/CSB, have been shown to act in a similar manner (19Shen X. Mizuguchi G. Hamiche A. Wu C. Nature. 2000; 406: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 21Citterio E. Van Den Boom V. Schnitzler G. Kanaar R. Bonte E. Kingston R.E. Hoeijmakers J.H. Vermeulen W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7643-7653Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Here we present experimental evidences of chromatin-remodeling activity by a member of the DDM1 subfamily. Our results show that DDM1 binds to both free DNA and nucleosomes with similar affinity (Fig. 1). However, the binding to the nucleosomal target resulted in a different pattern of gel-resolved complexes compared with the binding to free DNA. The diffused pattern formed by free DNA-DDM1 complexes indicated nonspecific interactions, whereas binding to the nucleosome resulted in the formation of a single distinct complex. These results indicate that in contrast to free DNA, the nucleosomal structure has a preferred binding site for DDM1. We did not observe any stable interaction of DDM1 with core histones in a pull-down assay (data not shown). These data suggest that although DNA is a major target for DDM1 binding, it is the nucleosomal structure that provides a specific structural framework for complex formation. This phenomenon is reminiscent of substrate binding by ISWI, another member of SWI2/SNF2 family. 3G. Langst, personal communication. Purified recombinant DDM1 has weak intrinsic ATPase activity in vitro. ATP hydrolysis was greatly stimulated by naked DNA. A slight additional stimulation by nucleosomal DNA was seen (Fig. 2). The catalytic subunits of all chromatin-remodeling complexes characterized so far display ATPase activity when assayed as isolated polypeptides. However, they differ in their response to DNA and chromatin. SWI2/SNF2-like proteins are fully active in the presence of DNA, and no additional stimulation by chromatin is observed (43Verbsky M.L. Richards E.J. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2001; 4: 494-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In contrast, other remodelers such as Mizα and ISWI require nucleosomal DNA to achieve their full activity (15Corona D.F. Langst G. Clapier C.R. Bonte E.J. Ferrari S. Tamkun J.W. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 16Brehm A. Langst G. Kehle J. Clapier C.R. Imhof A. Eberharter A. Muller J. Becker P.B.

This observation suggests that functionally, DDM1 may be more closely related to the SWI2/SNF2 subfamily than to ISWI or CHD/Mi2. The determination of the kinetic parameters of ATP hydrolysis in the absence or presence of DNA or nucleosomes showed that both DNA and nucleosomes increased primarily the V max of the reaction (2.9 and 3.1 times, respectively) while only marginally affecting the K m (1.2-fold increase in both cases). Because V max measures the turnover number of an enzyme, the above kinetic data indicate that both free DNA and nucleosomes stimulate the ATPase of DDM1 mainly by increasing its turnover number. Similar dependence was found earlier for Mi2α-remodeling ATPase (17Wang H.B. Zhang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Purified DDM1 showed nucleosome-remodeling activity in vitro. It is able to catalyze the redistribution of histone octamers on short DNA fragments in a process that requires the energy provided by ATP hydrolysis. Similar “nucleosome-sliding” activity has been observed for ISWI (15Corona D.F. Langst G. Clapier C.R. Bonte E.J. Ferrari S. Tamkun J.W. Becker P.B. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 239-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and dMi2 (16Brehm A. Langst G. Kehle J. Clapier C.R. Imhof A. Eberharter A. Muller J. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4332-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). As reported previously (46Dennis K. Fan T. Geiman T. Yan Q. Muegge K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2940-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), ISWI repositioned only nucleosomes located at the center of a 248-bp rDNA fragment but not those located at the end. Interestingly, the same group has reported that the ISWI containing complex ACF and purified dMi2 behave in exactly the opposite way (20Eberharter A. Ferrari S. Langst G. Straub T. Imhof A. Varga-Weisz P. Wilm M. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 16Brehm A. Langst G. Kehle J. Clapier C.R. Imhof A. Eberharter A. Muller J. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4332-4341Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Most likely, these observations reflect mechanistic differences between the remodelers. We found that DDM1, like ACF and dMi2, was considerably more efficient at mobilizing nucleosomes occupying the fragment termini than located at the center of the 248-bp rDNA. The mechanistic reasons for this directionality of nucleosome sliding are not clear. The nucleosome sliding activity of DDM1 appears to be relatively weak. To move ∼50% of the nucleosomes positioned at the end of a 248-bp rDNA fragment (∼30 fmol) to the center of the DNA molecule, 50 fmol of recombinant DDM1 were required. To achieve comparable efficiency it is sufficient to use about 7 times less of isolated, recombinant ISWI or 150 times less of ACF complex (20Eberharter A. Ferrari S. Langst G. Straub T. Imhof A. Varga-Weisz P. Wilm M. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear if different recombinant proteins can be directly compared. This observation relates DDM1 to other remodelers that require the context of the native complex for full activity. As demonstrated for other SWI2/SNF2-type proteins such as hBrm, BRG1 (47Jackson J.P. Lindroth A.M. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E. Nature. 2002; 416: 556-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar), and Mi2α (17Wang H.B. Zhang Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2517-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the associated proteins are essential to increase the rate of ATP hydrolysis. ATPase-associated subunits have also been shown to act as coupling factors that allow more efficient energy usage (20Eberharter A. Ferrari S. Langst G. Straub T. Imhof A. Varga-Weisz P. Wilm M. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3781-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, we can only speculate on the role of putative DDM1-associated proteins, as DDM1 has not yet been shown to form a larger complex. The low efficiency of DDM1 in remodeling assays may also reflect the intrinsic limitations of our experimental system. To demonstrate the remodeling activity of DDM1, standard chromatin-remodeling assay has been used. However, it is possible that this assay, developed for other remodelers, is not perfectly suited for DDM1. Chromatin-remodeling complexes appear to have evolved to fulfill various nuclear functions and to induce different changes in the structure of chromatin. It is likely that some novel assay system is required to fully characterize the mechanisms of DDM1-induced chromatin remodeling. DDM1 is involved in the maintenance of DNA methylation (36Kakutani T. Jeddeloh J.A. Richards E.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 130-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similarly to ddm1, mutations in Lsh, a gene encoding a mouse homolog of DDM1, also cause alterations in the DNA methylation pattern (46Dennis K. Fan T. Geiman T. Yan Q. Muegge K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2940-2944Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wished to see whether DNA methylation can affect DDM1 activity. It has been suggested that DDM1 may alter the chromatin structure to facilitate methyltransferase access to DNA (35Jeddeloh J.A. Stokes T.L. Richards E.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 94-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). According to this scenario, fully CpG-methylated DNA would represent the final product of the DDM1-assisted reaction. Therefore, it might be anticipated that methylated DNA would inhibit or at least not activate DDM1. Alternatively, DDM1 could act to compact the chromatin structure of methylated DNA to render these regions of the genome inaccessible to de-methylation and, therefore, help to preserve the methylation pattern. If this were the case, preferential activation of DDM1 by methylated DNA might be predicted. Surprisingly, we did not observe any effect of DNA methylation on the ATPase activity of DDM1 (Fig. 4). Band-shift assays also failed to show any effect of DNA methylation on substrate binding affinity (data not shown). One possible explanation for these findings is that DDM1 requires other associated proteins to sense the DNA methylation status. Alternatively, DNA methylation may have some subtle qualitative influence on the DDM1-catalyzed reaction that was not detected in the experimental system used. Recently the CpXpG DNA methylation catalyzed by the chromomethylase 3 was found to depend on the activity of kryptonite (47Jackson J.P. Lindroth A.M. Cao X. Jacobsen S.E.

Science. 2002; 297: 1871-1873Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated the alteration of the chromosomal distribution of Lys-9-methylated histone H3 in ddm1 mutants. Therefore, we speculate that DDM1 could be involved in histone H3 Lys-9 methylation. According to this scenario the effect on DNA methylation, which is seen in ddm1 plants, would be indirect.

https://openalex.org/W2037903288,"We have previously shown that fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 1B (FHF1B), a cytosolic member of the fibroblast growth factor family, associates with the sensory neuron-specific channel Na(v)1.9 but not with the other sodium channels present in adult rat dorsal root ganglia neurons. We show in this study that FHF1B binds to the C terminus of the cardiac voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v)1.5 and modulates the properties of the channel. The N-terminal 41 amino acid residues of FHF1B are essential for binding to Na(v)1.5, and the conserved acidic rich domain (amino acids 1773-1832) in the C terminus of Na(v)1.5 is sufficient for association with this factor. Binding of the growth factor to recombinant wild type human Na(v)1.5 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells produces a significant hyperpolarizing shift in the voltage dependence of channel inactivation. An aspartic acid to glycine substitution at position 1790 of the channel, which underlies one of the LQT-3 phenotypes of cardiac arrythmias, abolishes the interaction of the Na(v)1.5 channel with FHF1B. This is the first report showing that interaction with a growth factor can modulate properties of a voltage-gated sodium channel."

For elucidating signaling mechanisms involved in RA-induced neuronal differentiation, we have selected SH-SY5Y cells, which are an established in vitro cell model for studying RA signaling. Here we report that RA-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells is coupled with increased expression/activation of TGase andin vivo transamidation and activation of RhoA. In addition, RA promotes formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes, and activation of ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38α/β/γ MAP kinases. Using C-3 exoenzyme (RhoA inhibitor) or monodansylcadaverine (TGase inhibitor), we show that transamidated RhoA regulates cytoskeletal rearrangement and activation of ERK1/2 and p38γ MAP kinases. Further, by using stable SH-SY5Y cell lines (overexpressing wild-type, C277S mutant, and antisense TGase), we demonstrate that transglutaminase activity is required for activation of RhoA, ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38γ MAP kinases. Activated MAP kinases differentially regulate RA-induced neurite outgrowth and neuronal marker expression.

Highland M. Kaiser M. Clagett-Dame M. Dev. Biol. 2000; 220: 263-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). During normal embryogenesis, there is a requirement for precise timing of the exposure of embryonal structures to RA and a coordinated pattern of expression of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and retinoic acid X receptor (RXR) isoforms (2Smith S.M. Dickman E.D. Power S.C. Lancman J. J. Nutr. 1998; 128: 467S-470SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, RA plays an important role in the function of the adult brain, which has been shown to synthesize RA and express retinoid receptors, as well as cellular-binding proteins (3Zetterstrom R.H. Lindqvist E. Mata de Urquiza A. Tomac A. Eriksson U. Perlmann T. Olson L. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 407-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Many studies on a variety of embryogenic neuronal cell types have shown that RA can stimulate both neurite number and length (4Maden M. Methods Mol.

The RA-induced change to a neuronal phenotype in SH-SY5Y cells is associated with increased expression of tissue transglutaminase (TGase) (10Piacentini M. Annicchiarico-Petruzzelli M. Oliverio S.

TGase, a GTP-binding protein, participates in signal transduction pathways as a nonconventional G-protein, and exhibits distinct GTP-binding/hydrolyzing and transglutaminase activities (13Singh U.S. Erickson J.W.

Transglutaminase activity (or transamidation function), used to cross-link polyamines such as putrescine, spermine, or spermidine to target proteins, is regulated by the GTP binding activity of TGase (13Singh U.S. Erickson J.W.

The transamidation reaction of TGase has been implicated in a number of biological processes such as axonal regeneration, cellular differentiation, and apoptosis (17Eitan S. Schwartz M.

The Rho family of small G-proteins, primarily RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, are known to have a significant role in neuronal differentiation (20Luo L. Nat. Rev.

Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). Like other G-proteins, RhoA binds GTP in the active state, and following hydrolysis, returns to an inactive GDP-bound state (26Bourne H.R. Wrischnik L. Kenyon C. Nature. 1990; 348: 678-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The glutamine residue at position 63 of RhoA (switch II domain) is required for GTP hydrolysis (27Rittinger K. Walker P.A. Eccleston J.F. Smerdon S.J. Gamblin S.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 758-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). After deamidation/transamidation, glutamine 63 is not available for GTP hydrolysis, and RhoA is constitutively activated (28Flatau G. Lemichez E. Gauthier M. Chardin P. Paris S. Fiorentini C. Boquet P. Nature. 1997; 387: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar,29Masuda M. Betancourt L. Matsuzawa T. Kashimoto T. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Horiguchi Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 521-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). RA promotes activation of TGase and in vivotransamidation of RhoA (at glutamine 63) in HeLa cells. After transamidation, RhoA binds/activates RhoA-associated kinase-2 (ROCK-2), a downstream target and an effector of GTP-bound RhoA, leading to increased stress fiber and focal adhesion complex formation (15Singh U.S. Kunar M.T. Kao Y.L. Baker K.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mitogens, tumor promoters, and cell differentiation inducing agents trigger an intracellular signaling cascade, which involves Ras and Rho GTPases and leads to activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (30Aznar S. Lacal J.C. Cancer Lett. 2001; 165: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that ERK/MAPK pathway is crucial for NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of the cells, since blockade of the ERK/MAPK activation inhibits neurite induction (31Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar,32Pang L. Sawada T. Decker S.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13585-13588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (896) Google Scholar), and constitutive activation of the ERK/MAPK pathway results in neurite outgrowth (33Cowley S. Paterson H. Kemp P. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar, 34Encinas M. Iglesias M. Llecha N. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1409-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, some other findings demonstrate that sustained activation of ERK/MAPK does not induce neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglionic (DRG) sensory and sympathetic neurons and SH-SY5Y cells (35Klinz F.J. Wolff P. Heumann R. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Olsson A.K. Nanberg E. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These observations suggest the existence of an additional signaling pathway(s) important for neuronal differentiation. Activation of c-Jun amino-terminal kinase is required for RA-induced neuronal differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma cells (37Wang H. Ikeda S. Kanno S. Guang L.M. Ohnishi M. Sasaki M. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 503: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The subfamily of p38 MAP kinases includes p38α (38Han J. Lee J.D. Bibbs L. Ulevitch R.J. Science. 1994; 265: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (2420) Google Scholar), p38β (39Jiang Y. Chen C., Li, Z. Guo W. Gegner J.A. Lin S. Han J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17920-17926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), p38γ (40Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.F. Moller N.P. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 30122-30128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Sustained activation of p38α promotes neuronal differentiation, and inhibition of p38 α/β by a specific inhibitor SB203580 or by expression of dominant-negative constructs of the p38 pathway blocks neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (42Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Studies have demonstrated that p38γ is highly expressed in human skeletal muscle and appears to function as a signal transducer during differentiation of myoblasts to myotubes (40Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J.F. Moller N.P. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4355-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, its role in neuronal differentiation is not demonstrated. There is growing evidence that RA-induced neuronal differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells is mediated by TGase. Using stable cell lines of SH-SY5Y, overexpressing wild type, C277S mutant (transglutaminase-defective), and antisense TGase, it has been demonstrated that TGase is necessary and sufficient in promoting neurite outgrowth (12Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanisms involved during differentiation are not known. Here, we present evidence that RA-induced neuronal differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells is associated with increased expression/activation of TGase, leading to transamidation of RhoA. After transamidation, RhoA is activated and promotes formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes. The transamidated RhoA also promotes activation of ERK1/2 and p38γ MAP kinase, which may regulate nuclear events for promoting gene expression during neuronal differentiation. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. RA, common use reagents, and vinculin antibody were from Sigma; RhoA, GAP-43, actin, ERK 1/2, JNK1, and p38 α/β MAPK antibodies, ATF-2, c-Jun, and protein A/G-agarose were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; p38γ, δ MAP kinase antibody, myelin basic protein (MBP) were from Upstate Biotechnology; TGase and neurofilament B (NF-B) antibodies were purchased from Neomarkers. Texas Red-X phalloidin and fluorescein-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody were from Molecular Probes; [32P]ATP and [14C]putrescine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences and the signal enhancer kit used for autoradiography of 14C-labeled proteins was from AmershamBiosciences. C-3 exoenzyme, PD98059, SB202190, and JNK inhibitor were from CalBiochem. SH-SY5Y cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin; 1% each) in a 5% CO2humidified incubator at 37 °C. Stable cell lines of SH-SY5Y cells, stably transfected with vector, wild-type TGase, an inactive TGase mutant (C277S, without transamidating activity due to a point mutation within the active site), or an antisense TGase construct (which blocks endogenous and RA-induced expression of TGase) were obtained from Dr. Gail V. Johnson, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Alabama. Cells were grown in the presence of 150 μg/ml G418 and 10% FBS. Cells grown to subconfluence (20%) were untreated or treated with RA at 5 μm or vehicle (Me2SO), in medium containing 3% FBS for 1–4 days, as indicated in the figures. Medium with or without different agents was replaced every day. Untreated and RA treated SH-SY5Y cells were lysed in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was sedimented at 15,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and used for immunoprecipitation of p38α/β, -γ, -δ MAP kinase, JNK1, or ERK 1/2. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer and two times with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm MgCl2) and resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing 4 μg of GST-ATF-2, GST-c-jun, or 20 μg of MBP, 50 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, terminated by the addition of 5× Laemmli's sample buffer. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. Loading differences (between samples) were determined by blotting the membrane with anti-ERK, JNK1, or p38 α/β, -γ, -δ antibodies. The expression level of TGase, neuronal marker growth-associated protein 43 (GAP-43), and neurofilament B (NF-B) were determined by immunoblotting. Cells were treated with or without RA in medium containing 10% FBS for the indicated times. After washing with cold PBS, the cells were harvested in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. Insoluble material was removed by sedimentation at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration was determined according to the Bio-Rad method. Lysates (50 μg of protein) were electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, blotted with anti-TGase, GAP-43, and NF-B antibody. The blots were reprobed with anti-actin antibody to determine the loading difference between samples. Scanning densitometry was used for semiquantitative analysis of the data. RhoA activation was determined using the Rhotekin-binding assay, as previously described (43Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was sedimented at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Equal volume of cell lysates was incubated at 4 °C, for 45 min with 30 μg of GST-RBD (GST fusion protein containing the RhoA binding domain of Rhotekin) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Sigma). The beads were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and eluted proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE. Activated RhoA was detected by Western blotting with monoclonal antibody against RhoA. The amount of RBD-bound Rho was normalized to the total amount of RhoA in cell lysates for the comparison of Rho activity (activated Rho) in different samples. Immunoflourescence studies on stress fiber and focal adhesion complex formation were performed using SH-SY5Y cells grown on chamber slides (Lab-Tek II, Nalgen Nunc Int.) in medium with 3% FBS. After washing with cold PBS, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde at 21 °C for 20 min. Cells were exposed to 0.2% Triton X-100 for 3 min after washing with PBS. To block nonspecific binding, cells were first incubated with 100 mm glycine for 20 min at room temperature, and then incubated with primary antibody at 21 °C for 30 min (dilutions: vinculin monoclonal antibody, 1:400; Texas Red-X phalloidin, 1:40). After washing three times with PBS, fluorescein-labeled secondary antibody (1:400) was added and incubated for an additional 30 min and washed two times with PBS. Coverslips were mounted with anti-fade medium (ProLong®, Molecular Probes) and slides viewed with an Olympus Provis fluorescence microscope. Pictures of the slides were taken with a digital color camera (Olympus UltraPix 2000 RGB). To study the effect of RhoA and MAPK pathways on RA-induced neurite outgrowth, SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with C-3 exoenzyme, monodansylcadaverine (MDC), PD98059 (specific MEK inhibitor), SB202190 (specific inhibitor of p38 MAPK), and JNK inhibitor or Me2SO before addition of 5 μm RA in medium with 10% FBS. Medium with or without different inhibitors was replaced every day. After 4 days, the cell photographs were taken using a Nikon digital camera. The cell lysates were used for determining neuronal marker expression and transglutaminase activity. Untreated and RA-treated SH-SY5Y cells were lysed, and 100 μg of protein from the lysate was used for the assay of transglutaminase activity, as previously described (13Singh U.S. Erickson J.W.

SH-SY5Y cells, grown to 40% subconfluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 3% FBS, were treated (or untreated) with 5 μm RA for 2 days. Labeling (in vivo) of [14C]putrescine (0.5 μCi/ml) was performed overnight in the presence of aminoguanidine (100 mm), as described previously (15Singh U.S. Kunar M.T. Kao Y.L. Baker K.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed and precipitated with RhoA antibody (or GST-RBD beads). Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (15%), and the gel was dried after incubating with a signal enhancer kit. Transamidated proteins were detected by autoradiography. Data presented are mean ± S.E. Statistical differences were determined by a Student's ttest for statistical significance (p < 0.05). RA-induced cellular differentiation is coupled with increased expression/activation of TGase in many cell lines (12Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V.

To further study the role of TGase in RA-induced neuronal differentiation in SH-SY5Y cells, we determined the expression level of TGase and neuronal markers in response to RA treatment. As shown in Fig. 1, A and B, up-regulation of TGase expression was observed after 1 day of RA treatment, which was associated with increased transglutaminase activity (∼10-fold, specific activity: 110 nmol of putrescine incorporated/mg of casein/mg of protein, compared with 10.5 nmol of putrescine incorporated/mg of casein/mg of protein, Fig. 1 C). Under similar conditions, RA time-dependently induced the expression of NF-B and GAP-43 from 1 to 4 days of treatment (Fig. 1, A and B), unlike actin (negative control of neuronal marker expression). These data demonstrated that RA-induced expression of neuronal markers was also associated with increased expression/activation of TGase, which might be involved in promoting neuronal differentiation. Previously we demonstrated that RhoA is an in vivo substrate of TGase and RA promotes transamidation of RhoA in HeLa cells (15Singh U.S. Kunar M.T. Kao Y.L. Baker K.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2413-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To address the question of whether RA-induced expression of TGase in SH-SY5Y cells promotes transamidation of RhoA, we performed in vivo labeling of SH-SY5Y cells using [14C]putrescine. Incorporation of radiolabeled putrescine into RhoA was detected by immunoprecipitation and subsequent autoradiography of RhoA. As shown in Fig. 2 A, there was increased labeling of [14C]putrescine into RhoA (in vivotransamidation) after 24 h of RA treatment, which was consistent with the increased transglutaminase activity of TGase (Fig. 1 C). To examine whether transamidated RhoA is activated, the Rhotekin binding assay was performed. There was a putrescine-labeled protein of 24 kDa, precipitated by GST-RBD beads from RA (24 h)-treated cells (Fig. 2 B, upper panel) identified as RhoA (lower panel), indicating that transamidated RhoA functions as an activated form. As a negative control, cell lysates prepared fromin vivo transamidated cells were incubated with GST beads, and putrescine incorporation and activation of RhoA were examined. As shown in Fig. 2 C, we could not detect pull-down of [14C]RhoA or activated RhoA (using GST beads), demonstrating the specificity of GST-RBD assays. To determine the role of TGase in activation of RhoA, we have used monodansylcadaverine (MDC), a known TGase inhibitor (45Stenberg P. Curtis C.G. Wing D. Tong Y.S. Credo R.B. Gray A. Lorand L. Biochem. J. 1975; 147: 153-163Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and as shown in Fig. 3 A, MDC dose-dependently inhibited RA-induced transglutaminase activity. SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with RA in the absence or presence of MDC (50 μm for 2 h) and were subjected to the Rhotekin binding assay. RA promoted the pull-down of RhoA (or activation of RhoA) after 1 day of treatment and peaked in 2 days. The RA-induced activation of RhoA was blocked by MDC treatment (Fig. 3 B, upper panel). We further used stable SH-SY5Y cell lines overexpressing vector, wild-type, C277S mutant, and antisense TGase (12Tucholski J. Lesort M. Johnson G.V. Neuroscience. 2001; 102: 481-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) for determining the role of TGase in RhoA activation (Fig. 3, C and D). Overexpression of wild-type TGase resulted in a significant activation of RhoA (25-fold increase compared with vector), unlike the C277S mutant- or antisense-overexpressing cell lines, where no change in RhoA activation was observed. RA treatment markedly induced activation of RhoA in a vector cell line (20-fold), which is similar to that of normal SH-SY5Y cells. Only a 1.5-fold increase of RhoA activation was observed in wild type, and no significant changes in RhoA activation were observed in C277S mutant and antisense cell lines after RA treatment. Further, we determined the expression level of TGase in different cell lines (lowermost panel). RA induced up-regulation of TGase expression in vector-transfected cells, and did not result in any detectable changes in TGase expression in wild-type and C277S mutant cell lines. We could not detect any TGase expression in the absence or presence of RA in antisense TGase-overexpressing cells. These results indicated that TGase (transglutaminase activity) was required for RA-induced activation of RhoA in SH-SY5Y cells. One of the hallmarks of RhoA activation is increased cyotskeletal rearrangement (25Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3843) Google Scholar). To determine the effects of RhoA transamidation/activation on cytoskeletal rearrangement, SH-SY5Y cells were treated with RA in the presence or absence of C-3 exoenzyme (RhoA inhibitor) or MDC for 24 h, and immunofluoresence staining was performed with Texas Red-X phalloidin (for stress fiber formation) and vinculin (for focal adhesion complex formation). There was increased stress fiber formation (Fig. 4 A) and focal adhesion complex formation (Fig. 4 B) in response to RA treatment. A minimum of 24 h of RA treatment was required to induce the changes in stress fiber and focal adhesion complex formation. Treatment of cells with C-3 or MDC blocked RA-induced formation of stress fibers (Fig. 4 A) and focal adhesion complexes (Fig. 4 B). These results indicated that transamidation of RhoA was required for activation and inducing cytoskeletal rearrangement in response to RA in SH-SY5Y cells. Recent studies suggest that MAPK pathways play a role in neuronal differentiation (34Encinas M. Iglesias M. Llecha N. Comella J.X. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1409-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). To determine whether the MAPK pathway is involved in RA-induced neuronal differentiation of SH-SY5Y cells, MAP kinase (ERK1/2, JNK, and p38) activity was determined by in vitro kinase assay. As shown in Fig. 5, RA induced significant activation of ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38γ MAP kinase. ERK1/2 and p38γ MAP kinase activation peaked at 24 h, and JNK activation peaked at 48 h. Under similar conditions, RA induced mild activation of p38α/β, but had no effect on p38δ activation. Corresponding Western blots of ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38α/β, -γ, and -δ showed an equal amount of protein in different samples. To address the question, whether RA-induced activation of MAP kinases are mediated by TGase and resulting transamidation/activation of RhoA, we determined the effect of MDC and C-3 exoenzyme on activation of MAP kinases. As shown in Fig. 6, Aand B, RA-induced activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38γ was blocked by MDC treatment, indicating a role of transglutaminase activity in their activation. On the other hand, treatment of cells with C-3 exoenzyme blocked RA-induced activation of p38γ, and partially inhibited the activation of ERK1/2, but had no effect on JNK activation, indicating that transamidated RhoA may not be involved in RA-induced JNK activation. Under similar conditions, we demonstrated that MDC or C-3 exoenzyme had no effect on activation of p38α/β (data not shown) or RA-induced up-regulation of TGase expression (Fig. 6 A, bottom panel). Using stable SH-SY5Y cell lines (overexpressing wild-type, C277S mutant, and antisense TGase), we further examined the role of TGase in activation of MAP kinases. Overexpression of wild-type TGase promoted the activation of ERK1/2, JNK1, and p38γ MAP kinase (2-fold, 2-fold, and 3-fold, respectively, compared with vector) as shown in Fig. 7, A and B. Only basal level activation was observed in the C277S mutant- and antisense-overexpressing cells, indicating transglutaminase activity of TGase plays an important role"
https://openalex.org/W1979176407,"We have demonstrated previously that the core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) exhibits suppression activity on gene expression and replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV). Here we further elucidated the suppression mechanism of HCV core protein. We demonstrated that HCV core protein retained the inhibitory effect on HBV gene expression and replication when expressed as part of the full length of HCV polyprotein. Based on the substitution mutational analysis, our results suggested that mutation introduced into the bipartite nuclear localization signal of the HCV core protein resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of core protein but did not affect its suppression ability on HBV gene expression. Mutational studies also indicated that almost all dibasic residue mutations within the N-terminal 101-amino acid segment of the HCV core protein (except Arg39–Arg40) impaired the suppression activity on HBV replication but not HBV gene expression. The integrity of Arg residues at positions 101, 113, 114, and 115 was found to be essential for both suppressive effects, whereas the Arg residue at position 104 was important only in the suppression of HBV gene expression. Moreover, our results indicated that the suppression on HBV gene expression was mediated through the direct interaction of HCV core protein with the trans-activator HBx protein, whereas the suppression of HBV replication involved the complex formation between HBV polymerase (pol) and the HCV core protein, resulting in the structural incompetence for the HBV pol to bind the package signal and consequently abolished the formation of the HBV virion. Altogether, this study suggests that these two suppression effects on HBV elicited by the HCV core protein likely depend on different structural context but not on nuclear localization of the core protein, and the two effects can be decoupled as revealed by its differential targets (HBx or HBV pol) on these two processes of the HBV life cycle.

The viral genome consists of a positive-stranded RNA of about 9.6 kb that encodes a large polyprotein of 3008–3037 amino acids (reviewed in Ref. 3Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This polyprotein undergoes proteolytic processing by cellular signalases and viral proteases to yield at least 10 mature viral proteins classified as structural or nonstructural (NS) proteins (3Reed K.E. Rice C.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 55-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The core protein, which is located at the N terminus of the polyprotein, is a component of viral capsid. It is phosphorylated (4Shih C.-M. Chen C.-M. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1160-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has both nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (reviewed in Ref.5Lai M.M.C. Ware C.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2000; 242: 117-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and possesses several distinct functions. For example, it acts as a regulatory protein that positively or negatively modulates the cellular or viral promoters (5Lai M.M.C. Ware C.F. Curr. Top. Microbiol.

Moreover, the core protein is capable of transforming primary rat embryo fibroblasts in cooperation with Ras (18Ray R.B. Lagging L.M. Meyer K. Steele R. Ray R. J.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV), a member of the hepadnavirus family, is a DNA virus with partially double-stranded DNA genome held in a circular conformation by overlapping 5′-ends of the DNA strands (20Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also associated with the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (20Ganem D. Varmus H.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 651-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HBV encodes 4 overlapping reading frames that code for surface proteins (HBsAg), core protein (HBc/HBeAg), polymerase (pol), and the X protein (HBx). Among them, HBx has received much attention because it is regarded as a multifunctional protein important for the viral life cycle and viral-host interactions (reviewed in Refs.21Koike K.

In addition, it up-regulates the expression of HBV genes by trans-activating the HBV enhancer and promoters (28Faktor O. Shaul Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 861-872Google Scholar, 29Nakatake H. Chisaka O.

Wands J.R. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1223-1227Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite containing a DNA genome, HBV replicates via reverse transcription of a linear, terminally redundant RNA pre-genome that is packaged into a viral capsid (48Summers J. Mason W.S. Cell. 1982; 29: 403-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar). This pre-genomic RNA functions additionally as mRNA for the synthesis of two viral proteins, core protein and pol, which in turn interact with the package signal (termed ε) that appeared at the 5′-end of the pre-genomic RNA to initiate the RNA encapsidation process (49Bartenschlager R. Junker-Niepmann M. Schaller H. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Hirsch R. Lavine J. Chang L. Varmus H. Ganem D. Nature. 1990; 344: 552-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Encapsidation of the RNA template is under stringent control, because only the pre-genomic RNA is selectively encapsidated. In HBV, the ε package signal of the pre-genomic RNA is characterized by the presence of a stem-loop structure that is believed to serve as the docking site for the binding of the pol and is essential for both packaging and DNA priming (49Bartenschlager R.

Synthesis of the two viral DNA strands occurs within the nucleocapsid, and it is sequential in the way that minus strand DNA synthesis occurs first by using the pol protein itself as a primer, and followed by the plus strand DNA synthesis via the concerted actions of the reverse transcriptase and RNase H activities of pol protein (54Tavis J.E. Perri S. Ganem D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3536-3543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55Bartenschlager R. Schaller H. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4185-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 56Wang G.-H. Seeger C.

Recently, it was found that the interaction of molecular chaperones (Hsp90 and Hsp60) with HBV pol is critical for the maintenance of the enzyme in a conformation competent for its functions (59Hu J.

Still other findings suggest a reciprocal inhibition between these two viruses in patients coinfected with HBV and HCV (71Pontisso P. Ruvoletto M.G. Fattovich G. Chemello L. Gallorini A. Ruol A.

Along this line, our previous data indicated that the HCV core protein had thetrans-suppression activity on HBV gene expression and replication (74Shih C.-M., Lo, S.J. Miyamura T. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This trans-suppression ability of HCV core protein was positively regulated by protein kinase A and C through modulation of the phosphorylation level of its Ser99 and Ser116 residues (4Shih C.-M. Chen C.-M. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1160-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the suppression of HBV encapsidation by the HCV core protein was more severe when compared with that in the HBV gene expression (4Shih C.-M. Chen C.-M. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1160-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 74Shih C.-M., Lo, S.J. Miyamura T. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact molecular mechanism for these suppression effects remains to be determined. Because HCV core protein is a multifunctional protein with several functional motifs, including basic charged residues and nuclear localization signals (74Shih C.-M., Lo, S.J. Miyamura T. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 75Chang S.C. Yen J.H. Kang H.Y. Jang M.H. Chang M.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Virol. 1995; 76: 53-61Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and because our initial attempt to locate the suppressive domain of HCV core protein suggests the importance of the C-terminal 22-amino acid segment encompassing residues 101–122 (74Shih C.-M., Lo, S.J. Miyamura T. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in this study we introduced mutations into the basic residues within NLSs or 22-residue suppressive domains. The properties of HCV core mutant variants were examined in order to understand whether the same domain is involved in both suppressive activities of the HCV core protein. The involvement of HBx in this suppression effect by the HCV core protein was also explored. Additionally, the in vitro coimmunoprecipitation method and streptavidin-agarose affinity chromatography were adapted for the study of the mutual interaction among the HCV core protein and HBV encapsidation components, HBV pol and package signal, in an attempt to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the interference of the HBV encapsidation by the HCV core protein. Our results shown here strongly suggest that HCV core protein inhibits the HBV gene expression and viral replication through interacting with the two important regulators in HBV life cycle, HBx and HBV pol proteins. Additionally, our results clearly indicate that the suppressive domain of core protein on HBV gene expression and viral replication is distinct with the former which is located mainly on the C-terminal 22 residues, whereas the latter spans almost the entire region of the HCV core protein, and several Arg residues (Arg101, Arg113, Arg114, and Arg115) are found to be essential for both suppressive activities. Moreover, in this study we also demonstrate that this suppression of HBV gene expression and replication occurs when HCV core protein is expressed as part of the HCV polyprotein. HCV core protein expression construct pECE/HCVC-KF was described previously (74Shih C.-M., Lo, S.J. Miyamura T. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this construct the structural protein of HCV contains the whole coding region (191 amino acids) of core protein. Plasmid pHCVc-SE, a derivative of pGEM-3Zf(+) harboring the HCV core and partial E1 region, was constructed by inserting the 1.4-kbStuI-EcoRI fragment of pECEC/HCVS-EK (74Shih C.-M., Lo, S.J. Miyamura T. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 5823-5832Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the HindIII (Klenow-filled) and EcoRI-digested pGEM-3Zf(+) vector. When this construct is linearized with appropriate restriction endonuclease and transcribed in vitro with SP6 RNA polymerase, the transcripts containing various sizes of HCV core gene can be produced. Plasmid pET23a/HCVc is a derivative of pET-23a harboring the 0.6-kb full-length HCV core fragment (AccI-FspI) (7Chen C.-M. You L.-R. Hwang L.-H. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9417-9426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When linearized withSacII or ClaI and transcribed in vitrowith T7 RNA polymerase, the resulting transcript encodes the T7-tagged 101 or 122 amino acid residues of HCV core protein (T7-C101 or T7-122) with additional 24 amino acids (including 11 amino acids of T7 tag) at the N-terminal segment of the HCV core protein. Plasmids pGST/HCVc24, pGST/HCVc101, pGST/HCVc122, and pGST/HCVc195 are derivatives of pGEX-3KS that direct the synthesis of different lengths of HCV core protein fused with the C terminus of GST (4Shih C.-M. Chen C.-M. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1160-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chen C.-M. You L.-R. Hwang L.-H. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9417-9426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids pSRα/HCVc101, pSRα/HCVc122, and pSRα/HCVc195, the mammalian expression constructs for different lengths of HCV core protein, were described previously (14You L.R. Chen C.M. Yeh T.S. Tsai T.Y. Mai R.T. Lin C.H. Lee Y.H.W. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 2841-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pSRα/HCV-FL is the mammalian expression construct for the full length of HCV polyprotein. This plasmid was constructed by insertion of the 1.1-kb HindIII (filled in)-KpnI fragment consisting of the pSRα promoter region (HindIII-PstI fragment, 0.8 kb) and 0.3-kb of HCV core coding region into the XbaI (filled in)/KpnI-digested p90/HCVFLlongpU (kindly provided by Apath). Plasmid pSHH2.1 contains a tandem dimer of the HBV genome inserted at the EcoRI site of the vector plasmid pSV08 (77Will H. Cattaneo R. Koch H.-G. Darai G. Schaller H. Schellekens H. van Eerd P.M.C.A. Deinhardt F. Nature. 1982; 299: 740-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Plasmid pHBV-PS, a derivative of pGEM-3Zf(+), was constructed by excising the 264-bp BglII (filling-in the overhangs with Klenow enzyme)-HindIII fragment of HBV package signal sequence from plasmid pHBV3.5 (78Lin C.-G. Lo S.J. Virology. 1992; 188: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and then inserting it into theSmaI/ HindIII-digested pGEM-3Zf(+). When linearized with EcoRI and transcribed in vitrowith SP6 RNA polymerase, pHBV-PS produces a 264-nucleotide transcript containing the HBV package signal, spanning HBV nucleotides 1722–1986 (HBV adw subtype, with nucleotide positions numbered from the unique EcoRI site of HBV). Plasmid pHBV97Po, a derivative of pBluescript II KS+/− harboring the 2.89-kb of full-length HBV polymerase gene fragment, was provided by C. M. Chang (National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan). In this construct, the polymerase gene fragment (AluI-SacI fragment) was derived from pMH3/3097 (79Junker M. Galle P. Schaller H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 10117-10132Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). When this construct is linearized with appropriate restriction endonucleases and transcribed in vitro with T3 RNA polymerase, transcripts coding for various length of HBV polymerase can be produced. Plasmid pHEX-X1, the mammalian expression construct for HBx under the HBXpromoter control, was provided by S. J. Lo (National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan). Plasmid pGST-HBx, which can direct the expression of the full-length HBx protein fused with the C terminus of GST, was constructed by insertion of the 462-bp PCR-generatedEcoRI/XhoI fragment of the HBX gene derived from plasmid pMH3/3097, into theEcoRI/XhoI-digested pGEX-5X-1 (AmershamBiosciences). To construct plasmid pCMV-HA-HBx for generation of HA-tagged HBx, the same 462-bp EcoRI-XhoI fragment of HBX gene was subcloned into theEcoRI/XhoI-digested pCDNA-3-HA vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid pFLAG-HBx, the mammalian expression construct for FLAG-tagged HBx, was constructed by insertion of the 462-bp PCR-generated HindIII-EcoRI fragment of theHBX gene from plasmid pMH3/3097 into theHindIII/EcoRI-digested pFLAG-CMV-2 (Eastman Kodak). Plasmid pGFP-HBVpol, which can express green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged HBV polymerase protein, was cloned by insertion of the 3-kb EcoRV-SmaI pol gene fragment from the pMH-ΔC-BE (provided by S. J. Lo, National Yang-Ming University, Taiwan) into the EcoRI (filled in)-digested pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech). The plasmid pFLAG-HBVpol was generated by inserting the 3-kb HindIII-SmaI DNA fragment of plasmid pGFP-HBVpol into HindIII/SmaI site of pFLAG-CMV-2. The “Altered Sites” system (Promega) was used forin vitro mutagenesis of the HCV core or HBX gene as described by the supplier. The construct pSELECT/HCVC, a derivative of pSELECT-1 containing the full length of HCV core gene, was used for site-directed mutagenesis (4Shih C.-M. Chen C.-M. Chen S.-Y. Lee Y.-H.W. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1160-1171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HCV core mutants bearing lysine and/or arginine residue substitution mutations generated in this study are listed in Fig. 1. The oligonucleotides used for mutation were synthesized and indicated by the position of the first mutated amino acid residue in the HCV core protein (see below). The mutant primers used are as follows: M9, 5′-GTTACGTTTGGTTGCTGCTTGGGGTTTAGGAT-3′; M12, 5′-GACGGTTGGTGTTAGCTGCGGTTTTTCTTTGGGGTT3′; M17, 5′-TAACGTCCTGTGGGGCAGCGTTGGTGTTACGTTTGG-3′; M39, 5′-CCAACCTGGGGCCCGGCCGGCAACAAGTAAACTC-3′; M50, 5′-CCGCTCGGAAGTCGCCGCAGTCGCACGCACACC-3′; M61, 5′-GGGATAGGTTGTGCCGCTCCACGAGGTTGC-3′; M69, 5′-CCTGCCCTCGGGGGCGGCAGCCTTGGGGATAGG-3′; M101L, 5′-CGAGAGCCGAGGGTGAC-3′; M101K, 5′-GGCCGAGAGCCCTTGGGTGACAGGAGC-3′; M104L, 5′-CAACTAGGCAGAGAGCCG-3′; M104K, 5′-CCAACTAGGCTTAGAGCCGCGGGGTG-3′; M113L, 5′-GACCTACGCAGGGGGTCATT-3′; M113K, 5′-GACCTACGCTTGGGGTCATTAGG-3′; M114L, 5′-CGCGACCTAAGCCGGGGTC-3′; M114K, 5′-ATTACGCGACCTCTTCCGGGGGTCATTAG-3′; M115A, 5′-CAAATTACGCGACGCACGCCGGGGGTC-3′; M115K, 5′-TTACGCGACTTACGCCGGGGG-3′; M117L, 5′-ACCCAAATTAAGCGACCTACG-3′; M117K, 5′-CTTACCCAAATTCTTCGACCTACGCCGG-3′; and M117D, 5′-CTTACCCAAATTATCCGACCTACGCCGG-3′. The underlined boldface bases are mutated bases. All mutant sequences were confirmed by sequencing. The 0.7-kb HindIII-EcoRI fragments of mutant DNA in pSELECT/HCVC derivatives were then subcloned into HindIII/EcoRI-digested pECE expression vector, and the resultant pECE derivatives harboring mutated HCV core genes were used for transfection. To generate HBx null HBV genome, the three ATG codons at positions 1, 79, and 103 in the open reading frame of HBX gene were converted into Val codon.

NDOS consists of three protein components: a flavo-[2Fe-2S] reductase (NDR), a ferredoxin electron transfer protein (NDF), and an (αβ)3 oxygenase (NDO) containing a mononuclear iron site and a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster in each α-subunit. The active site is built across a subunit-subunit boundary, and each subunit contributes one type of metal center. Our previous studies have shown that NDO with both metal centers reduced is capable of an O2-coupled single turnover to yield the correctcis-diol product in the absence of the NDR and NDF components (Wolfe, M. D., Parales, J. V., Gibson, D. T., and Lipscomb, J. D. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 1945–1953). It is shown here that addition of H2O2 to NDO allows reaction with naphthalene to rapidly yield the correct product in a “peroxide shunt” reaction that does not require a reduced Rieske cluster. The mononuclear Fe2+ center is oxidized during turnover, while the Rieske cluster remains in the oxidized state. Peroxide shunt turnover in the presence of 18O-labeled H2O2, H2O, or O2 shows that both oxygen atoms in the product derive primarily from H2O2. The peroxide shunt halts after one turnover despite the presence of excess H2O2 and naphthalene, but this is not the result of enzyme inactivation. Rather, it appears that the product cannot be released when the mononuclear iron is in the Fe3+state, blocking a second turnover. This work supports the hypotheses that the cis-dihydroxylation activity of NDOS requires only the NDO component, that a peroxo intermediate is formed during normal catalysis, and that product release requires an additional reducing equivalent beyond those necessary for the first turnover. Naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase (NDOS) catalyzes the NAD(P)H and O2-dependent oxidation of naphthalene to (+)-cis-(1R,2S)-dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene.

Yeh H.J. Jerina D.M. Patel T.R. Davey J.F. Gibson D.T. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 575-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). The enzyme system consists of an NAD(P)H reductase (NDR) containing FAD and a plant-type [2Fe-2S] cluster, an electron transfer protein (NDF) containing a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster, and an oxygenase component (NDO). NDO has an (αβ)3 quaternary structure with a mononuclear nonheme iron site and a Rieske-type [2Fe-2S] cluster site in each α subunit. The crystal structure of NDO shows that these sites are separated by 44 Å within a given α subunit, but by only 12 Å across an α-α subunit boundary in the assembled enzyme, leading to the hypothesis that the nearby metal centers form the functional unit for catalysis (2Kauppi B. Lee K. Carredano E. Parales R.E. Gibson D.T. Eklund H. Ramaswamy S. Structure. 1998; 6: 571-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The Rieske cluster is believed to function primarily in electron transfer, whereas the substrate binding, oxygen activation, and insertion reactions are thought to occur at the mononuclear iron site of NDO (3Carredano E. Karlsson A. Kauppi B. Choudhury D. Parales R.E. Parales J.V. Lee K. Gibson D.T. Eklund H. Ramaswamy S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 701-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 4Parales R.E.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The overall reaction stoichiometry requires two electrons from an NAD(P)H and an O2 to form thecis-dihydrodiol product as shown in SchemeFS1. We recently reported that NDO with the mononuclear iron in the Fe2+ state and the Rieske cluster reduced by one electron (reduced NDO) can catalyze the conversion of naphthalene to naphthalenecis-diol in the absence of NDR and NDF in a single turnover reaction (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Substrate and O2 readily bind to reduced NDO and rapidly react to form an amount of product that is stoichiometric with the concentration of populated mononuclear Fe2+ sites. The two electrons necessary for catalysis derive from the reduced metal centers, leaving each center in the oxidized state after the single turnover. The reaction is regulated by both substrate binding and the redox state of the Rieske cluster. If substrate is omitted or the Rieske cluster is oxidized, no reaction of O2 with the mononuclear iron site is observed on the time scale of turnover. The fact that two electrons are sufficient to allow oxygen activation and dihydroxylation in a single turnover of NDO suggests that the reactive species is either an Fe3+-(hydro)peroxo adduct or the electronically equivalent Fe5+-oxo species formed by cleavage of the O–O bond. Species of this type are believed to form in other types of oxygenases such as cytochrome P450 and methane monooxygenase (MMO) (6McMurry T.J. Groves J.T. Ortiz de Montellano P.R.

Que L., Jr. Science. 1997; 275: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these enzymes catalyze many of the same types of reactions as NDOS with alternative substrates. Substrate hydroxylation, N- andO-dealkylation, sulfoxidation, and desaturation are a few of the reactions that are known to be catalyzed by NDOS (11Resnick S.M. Lee K. Gibson D.T. J. Ind. Microbiol. 1996; 17: 438-457Crossref Google Scholar). In principle, reactive Fe3+-(hydro)peroxo or Fe5+-oxo intermediates could be formed by adding both oxygen and electrons together in the form of superoxide or hydrogen peroxide directly to the resting enzyme. Indeed, in the cases of P450 and MMO, it has proven possible to substitute hydrogen peroxide for an electron source and O2, in this way allowing O2-independent oxygenation reactions to be catalyzed (12Hrycay E.G. Gustafsson J.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Ernster L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 61: 43-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 13Andersson K.K. Froland W.A. Lee S.-K. Lipscomb J.D. New J.

These systems appear to be catalytic, both in the sense of accelerating the reaction with hydrogen peroxide and undergoing several turnovers, although P450 is rapidly inactivated during this process. In this study, we explore reduced oxygen species as the source of both oxygen and electrons for the NDO-catalyzed dihydroxylation of naphthalene. This obviates the need for internal electron transfer from the Rieske cluster allowing the reaction at the mononuclear iron site to be characterized in greater detail. It is shown here for the first time that a “peroxide shunt” is functional in NDO as observed for P450 and MMO, thereby implicating a peroxo intermediate of some type in the O2 activation process. However, it is also observed that NDO is limited to a single turnover in the peroxide shunt reaction. The basis of this phenomenon is shown to offer new insight into the requirements for continuous turnover by the enzyme. Moreover, the peroxide shunt represents a new reactivity for a nonheme iron dioxygenase. Naphthalene dioxygenase enzyme components and protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase were purified as previously described (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol.

Xanthine oxidase and bovine liver catalase were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals and Sigma Chemical Co., respectively. Isotopically enriched compounds were purchased from Isotec: H218O (95 atom %),18O2 (99 atom %), and H218O2 (90 atom %). Nitric oxide was purchased from Matheson Inc. (+)-cis-(1R,2S)-Dihydroxy-1,2-dihydronaphthalene (naphthalene cis-diol) was prepared as previously described (1Jeffrey A.M. Yeh H.J. Jerina D.M. Patel T.R. Davey J.F. Gibson D.T.

All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma and used without purification except for protocatechuic acid, which was further purified by recrystallization. Distilled water was purified using a Millipore reverse osmosis system before use. NDOS activity assays and protein determinations were performed as previously described (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V.

All NDO concentrations reported reflect the concentration of theoretical active sites and are referred to as “NDO αβ.” Where indicated, KCN was added to 10 mm prior to addition of NDOS components. To determine the effects of H2O2 (0–200 mm) on the activity of NDOS, hydrogen peroxide was added to NDO samples (120 μm NDO αβ in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.8, 250 μm naphthalene (saturated aqueous solution)) in the presence or absence of 10 mm KCN. The samples were incubated from 0 to 15 min with mixing prior to adding the enzyme to the assay containing the other NDOS components and NADH. KCN was not found to affect the stability or activity of NDOS. Single turnover reactions and all product analyses were performed as described previously (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T.

The calculated error (S.D.) for all product yield measurements ranged from 6 to 10%. Superoxide shunt reactions were performed in triplicate at 23 °C in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.8, containing 70 μm NDO αβ, 250 μmnaphthalene, and 480 units of catalase. Two different methods were used to introduce O2⨪ into the reaction mixture. In the first method, aliquots of KO2/Me2SO were added to the reaction from a stock solution of KO2 (15 mm). The stock solution was prepared immediately before the experiment by dissolving solid KO2 in dry Me2SO under an atmosphere of N2 in an anaerobic dry box. Five 10-μl additions were made to the enzyme mixture at 1-min intervals with constant mixing (final O2⨪ concentration = 940 μm). A second method utilized the xanthine oxidase (XO) system to generate O2⨪ in situ. Reactions contained 40 milliunits of XO and were initiated by addition of xanthine to 500 μm. Aliquots of each reaction were transferred at various times to plastic tubes, quenched by immersion into a 90 °C water bath for 2 min and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until product analysis was performed. Degradation of authentic naphthalene cis-diol was not observed following identical treatment with O2⨪. Control reactions for the effects of adventitious iron in the system were performed in the absence of NDO with the addition of 200 μmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O in solutions containing superoxide and naphthalene. Peroxide shunt reactions were carried out using 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.8, containing 50–70 μm NDO αβ and 250 μm naphthalene, and were initiated by addition of H2O2. In some instances, naphthalene was added to buffered solutions from a naphthalene stock solution prepared in methanol. Reaction mixtures were incubated at 23 °C for 30 s with constant stirring. Longer reaction times (up to 1 h) showed no increase in naphthalenecis-diol yield, and the reaction was complete within 10 s, the shortest time tested. The reactions were quenched as described above for the superoxide reactions. Alternatively, following the incubation period, protein samples were concentrated in Centricon 30 filtration devices to separate NDO from small molecules without protein denaturation. Control reactions were also performed by replacing NDO with 200 μmFe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O. Authentic naphthalene cis-diol showed no sign of degradation under identical peroxide shunt conditions. All reactions were performed 3–10 times. In all experiments, 10 mm KCN was included to inhibit any catalase activity that might arise from a contaminating heme enzyme. Control experiments showed that the activity of NDOS was not affected by KCN at this concentration, and no background catalase activity was detected. Anaerobic reactions were performed in septum-sealed reaction vials by first flushing the buffered enzyme solution with argon for 10 min. A small volume of naphthalene dissolved in methanol was then added to saturate the solution. Finally, protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase and protocatechuate were added to final concentrations of 5 μm and 1 mm, respectively, to remove any trace of remaining oxygen and scavenge any oxygen generated during the reactions. Following a 5-min incubation, H2O2was added to initiate the reaction. Some experiments required chelator treatment and iron reconstitution after the peroxide shunt. In this case, following a typical shunt reaction, NDO was treated with 5 mm EDTA and 5 mm o-phenanthroline for 2 h at 4 °C. The mixture was then dialyzed at 4 °C against 100 mm MES buffer, 5 mm EDTA (1:200 v/v) for 9 h to remove mononuclear iron and any product associated with NDO. EDTA was then removed by gel filtration over a Sephadex G-25 column. Reconstitution was completed at 23 °C by addition of 2 eq of Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2·6H2O in the presence of 250 μm naphthalene and 10 mm KCN. In some cases, a second peroxide shunt reaction was initiated after a 5-min incubation by addition of H2O2 to 30 mm. All18O incorporation experiments were completed at 23 °C using 100–200 μm NDO αβ in 100 mm MES buffer, pH 6.8, containing 10 mm KCN and 250 μm naphthalene. Septum-sealed, stirred reaction vials were used for all reactions. Peroxide shunt experiments carried out in either unlabeled or labeled water were completed by dilution of a buffered, concentrated, NDO solution with H2O or H218O (95 atom %), respectively. KCN and naphthalene were then added, and the reaction was initiated by addition of H2O2 to 40 mm. Following dilution, the final calculated H218O enrichment was 45 atom %. 18O2 reactions were completed by first flushing the enzyme solution with argon for 10 min. The argon headspace was then replaced with 18O2(99 atom %) by flushing the reaction vial for 1 min followed by a 5-min equilibration period under the 1 atm of18O2. KCN and naphthalene were then added, followed by H2O2 to 40 mm. H218O2 reactions were identical to those completed using H2O2 except that the 40 mm H2O2 was replaced with 28 mm H218O2 (90 atom %). A control sample was made by incubating 280 μm authentic naphthalene cis-diol with 40 mmH2O2 in the presence of H218O for 1 min. All reactions were quenched as described above and stored at −80 °C until further processed at which time each sample was thawed and centrifuged to remove precipitated protein. Naphthalene cis-diol was isolated from each sample by HPLC as described previously (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). After fractionation and collection, naphthalene cis-diol samples were dried using a Speed-Vac (Savant). Just before mass analysis, each sample was dissolved in 5 μl of methanol. Isotope ratios were determined using a least squares algorithm available at sx102a.niddk.nih.gov/iso.html. UV-visible, EPR, and stopped-flow measurements were performed as described previously (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Specific parameters are given in the figure legends. Electron impact mass spectroscopy (EI-MS) was performed using a JEOL SX102 mass spectrometer operated at an accelerating voltage of 70 eV. Samples were desorbed from the heated probe at a temperature of ∼80 °C. The instrument was scanned from m/z 40 to 400 every 2 s. The isotopic values were determined from the average of spectra acquired during the elution of the sample compound. Our previous studies of reduced NDO demonstrated that the two electrons necessary for hydroxylation of naphthalene to naphthalenecis-diol via the normal reductive oxygen activation pathway are derived from 1 e oxidation of both mononuclear iron and Rieske cluster metal centers (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because NDO is isolated with its mononuclear iron in the reduced state, half of the electrons required for a single turnover are present. Consequently, reaction between this form of NDO and O2⨪ in the presence of naphthalene would, in principle, create a system in which the requisite two electrons and two atoms of oxygen are present, and thus, turnover by a “superoxide shunt” might occur. We tested this idea using two different methods of introducing O2⨪ to NDO in the presence of naphthalene. TableI shows that neither superoxide system produced concentrations of product above what is typically observed bound to protein as isolated. As a control, authentic naphthalenecis-diol was exposed to O2⨪ under identical reaction conditions, and no degradation was observed.Table INDO reactions with superoxide and hydrogen peroxideShunt systemReaction timeNaphthalene cis-diol/αβNDO as isolated0.03 + KO25 min0.0130 min0.01 + X/XO10 min0.0130 min0.01 + 22 mm H2O210 s0.6210 min0.62 + Fe2+ + 22 mmH2O210 s0.73Fe2+ + KO25 minND1-aND, no product was detected. + X/XO5 minND + 22 mmH2O210 minNDAll reactions were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of 250 μm naphthalene.

Open table in a new tab All reactions were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures” in the presence of 250 μm naphthalene. Where indicated, 200 μm Fe2+ was added. Yields represent an average of four experiments. In contrast to O2⨪, H2O2 was found to readily react with NDO as isolated to initiate catalysis in a “peroxide shunt” reaction (Table I). Addition of an excess of both H2O2 and naphthalene to NDO resulted in the formation of significant amounts of the correct naphthalenecis-diol product as identified by HPLC and mass spectrometry. Approximately 50% of the total yield from the peroxide shunt reaction was achieved by addition of only a stoichiometric amount of H2O2 relative to the αβ subunit concentration (data not shown). At all peroxide concentrations, the peroxide shunt reaction was complete in less than 10 s. As shown in Table I, addition of Fe2+ to the reaction mixture increased the yield of naphthalene cis-diol formed, consistent with increasing the occupancy of mononuclear iron centers. However, under no conditions did we observe product yields greater than the concentration of NDO active sites in the assay. Several molecules were tested as potential effectors of the NDO peroxide shunt (Table II). Removal of O2 from the reaction mixture prior to addition of H2O2 resulted in a slight increase in product yield, whereas addition of oxygen radical scavengers such as superoxide dismutase and mannitol had no significant effect on the peroxide shunt yield. These results indicate that neither O2 nor diffusible oxygen-derived radicals are involved in the product forming reaction. Likewise, a buffered solution of Fe2+ and H2O2, the Fenton system known to produce a variety of reactive oxygen species, failed to generate naphthalenecis-diol from naphthalene (Table I). Addition of oxidized NDF to the shunt reaction also had no effect on the yield of product, showing that it does not play a role in the peroxide shunt.Table IIPotential effectors of the NDO peroxide shuntReaction condition or treatmentRelative naphthalene cis-diol yield2-aThe yield of product from each reaction is referenced to the amount formed in a reaction with NDO and hydrogen peroxide alone.%NDO + 30 mmH2O2100 − O2106 + SOD98 + mannitol104 + oxidized NDF100NDO + 30 mm H2O2100 after iron removal22-bRepresents the amount of product remaining associated with NDO following treatment with metal chelators, dialysis, and gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” after iron removal, + Fe2+ + 30 mmH2O271Reaction conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” All reactions were performed in triplicate and contained 250 μm naphthalene.2-a The yield of product from each reaction is referenced to the amount formed in a reaction with NDO and hydrogen peroxide alone.2-b Represents the amount of product remaining associated with NDO following treatment with metal chelators, dialysis, and gel filtration as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab Reaction conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” All reactions were performed in triplicate and contained 250 μm naphthalene. The low product yield of the peroxide shunt was unexpected, because both naphthalene and H2O2 (the source of electrons and oxygen) were present in large excess over NDO. In addition, repeated additions of H2O2 or naphthalene failed to increase the peroxide shunt product yield above that of a single turnover yield. The experiment was repeated with several different preparations of NDO only to find that each batch of enzyme had a different product yield associated with the shunt (TableIII). In each case, the yield approaches that from a single turnover of the same batch of enzyme using chemical reduction and O2 exposure. Control reactions using authentic naphthalene cis-diol indicate that H2O2 does not destroy the product (data not shown). Thus, the limited product yield from the peroxide shunt is not a result of insufficient quantities of substrates or product degradation.Table IIIYield comparison between peroxide shunt and single turnoverNDO preparationNaphthalenecis-diol/αβShunt/turnoverH2O2shuntSingle turnoverI0.620.670.93II0.520.570.91III0.320.420.76IV0.220.250.88Peroxide shunt reactions contained 30 mmH2O2.

Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), single turnover yields correlate well with the mononuclear iron present in each NDO preparation and thus present reasonable estimates of the fraction of active NDO αβ.

Both shunt and single turnover reactions were performed in triplicate as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown previously (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol.

Lee previously reported that the complete NDOS is slowly inactivated by hydrogen peroxide (16Lee K. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2719-2725Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, loss of NDO activity could also explain the product yield being limited to one turnover. To address this issue, NDO was incubated with different concentrations of H2O2 in the presence of naphthalene to allow the peroxide shunt reaction to occur. Then the enzyme was assayed using the standard NDOS steady-state reaction. Only with long incubation times and high H2O2 concentrations was significant inactivation of NDO observed. For example, a 5-min incubation with 30 mm hydrogen peroxide was required for a 60% decrease in activity. This incubation time is much longer than that required for the peroxide shunt product forming reaction to occur (<10 s). Thus, it appears that enzyme inactivation cannot account for the one-turnover nature of the peroxide shunt. Previously, we observed that product is tightly associated with NDO at the conclusion of single turnover (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Likewise, after performing a peroxide shunt reaction and separation of NDO from small molecules by ultrafiltration, 90% of the product formed was retained with the enzyme. A nearly identical amount of naphthalene cis-diol remained bound following single turnover of NDO. In another experiment, following a peroxide shunt reaction, the mononuclear iron (and any product bound to it) was removed from NDO using metal chelators, dialysis, and gel filtration. After this treatment, Fe2+was added back to the apoenzyme (the Rieske cluster remains intact), and naphthalene and H2O2 were added to initiate another peroxide shunt. As shown in Table II, the naphthalenecis-diol yield from the second shunt approached that formed during the first peroxide shunt reaction, suggesting that a sustained peroxide shunt is prevented by tightly bound naphthalenecis-diol in the active site. 2Adding one reducing equivalent from a stoichiometric concentration of reduced NDF followed by additional H2O2 to initiate a second peroxide shunt approximately doubled the yield, as expected. However, this treatment might also lead to product formation by the usual reductive oxygen activation pathway due to the fact that NDF can shuttle electrons between active sites that might result in the reduction of both Rieske and mononuclear iron centers (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To further characterize the NDO peroxide shunt, we studied the reaction using EPR spectroscopy and stopped-flow UV-visible methods. Fig. 1 shows EPR spectra of NDO before (a) and after (b) reaction with H2O2 in the presence of naphthalene. Addition of hydrogen peroxide to substrate-bound NDO leads to the rapid generation of an EPR signal at g = 4.3 arising from S = 5/2 Fe3+species with rhombic electronic symmetry (line width = 17 gauss). This signal arose on the same time scale as product formation (<10 s) and is identical to that from the previously characterized mononuclear Fe3+ formed at the conclusion of the NDO single turnover (5Wolfe M.D. Parales J.V. Gibson D.T. Lipscomb J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1945-1953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).

Furthermore, the lysine-mutated DOR, like its wild type counterpart, colocalized extensively with lysosomes after ligand-induced endocytosis.

Although many signaling receptors are endocytosed after ligand-induced activation, there are large differences in the degree to which various receptors thereafter traffic to lysosomes. Such differences in the endocytic trafficking of receptors have important functional consequences (4Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 5Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the case of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 events surrounding the initial endocytosis of receptors generally result in a rapid desensitization of signaling activity. Recycling of receptors back to the plasma membrane typically promotes functional resensitization, whereas sorting of internalized receptors to lysosomes leads to proteolytic down-regulation of receptors and a prolonged attenuation of signal transduction (7Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 8Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv.

These considerations have motivated considerable interest in elucidating mechanisms that control the sorting of specific signaling receptors in the endocytic pathway.Covalent modification of lysine residues by ubiquitin is well known to function as a signal targeting many proteins to proteasomes. Ubiquitination of cytoplasmic lysine residues has emerged more recently as a mechanism that also regulates the endocytic trafficking of various integral membrane proteins (10Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of lysine residues located in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the yeast GPCR Ste2p was initially shown to promote ligand-induced endocytosis of receptors (11Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). More recently, ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of Ste2p (12Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) has been shown to be essential for the subsequent sorting of endocytosed receptors to internal structures of the vacuole via a mechanism involving ubiquitin-dependent protein interactions occurring on the endosomal membrane (12Shih S.C.

Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF receptor plays an analogous role in sorting of internalized receptors to lysosomes in mammalian cells (14Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and β2-adrenergic receptor provide strong evidence that ubiquitination of cytoplasmic lysine residues is also essential for lysosomal trafficking of certain mammalian GPCRs (16Marchese A.

Ubiquitination of opioid receptors in the biosynthetic pathway has been shown to target DOR to proteasomes from the endoplasmic reticulum (22Petaja-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperriere A. Bhalla S.

Chem. 2001; 276: 4416-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), but the potential role of ubiquitination in mediating endocytic trafficking of DOR to lysosomes has not been investigated. There is accumulating evidence that the endocytic sorting of mammalian GPCRs can be modulated by a variety of non-covalent protein interactions (21Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), raising the question of whether ubiquitination is actually required for lysosomal trafficking of receptors in all cases. Furthermore, it has been argued that ligand-induced down-regulation of DOR can occur under some conditions by a distinct, ubiquitin-dependent mechanism involving targeting of receptors to proteasomes from the plasma membrane that is entirely distinct from down-regulation mediated by receptor trafficking to lysosomes (26Chaturvedi K. Bandari P. Chinen N. Howells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12345-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).With these considerations in mind we have investigated the potential role of proteasome activity and covalent ubiquitination in mediating ligand-induced proteolysis of DOR in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells, a model cell system in which receptor degradation via both proteasomes and lysosomes has been observed. Our results confirm that ligand-induced proteolysis in these cells is mediated primarily by lysosomes rather than proteasomes, and they establish that efficient lysosomal trafficking of opioid receptors, in contrast to other mammalian GPCRs described to date, does not require ubiquitination of the receptor protein.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONBased on a previous report that ligand-induced degradation of DOR is mediated primarily by proteasomes rather than lysosomes (26Chaturvedi K. Bandari P. Chinen N. Howells R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12345-12355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we re-examined the effects of inhibitors of proteasome function on ligand-induced degradation of FLAG-tagged DOR expressed in stably transfected HEK293 cells, the same model system in which we have previously observed that ligand-induced degradation of receptors is highly sensitive to inhibitors of lysosomal proteolysis (5Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). To our initial surprise, immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody indicated that the proteasome inhibitor MG132 strongly inhibited ligand-induced degradation of DOR (Fig. 1 A) without detectably inhibiting ligand-induced internalization of receptors (Fig. 1 B), closely similar to results obtained previously using inhibitors of lysosomal function (5Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Indeed, although MG132 is a highly potent inhibitor of a number of proteasome-associated proteases, this compound is not specific for proteasomes and also potently inhibits various cysteine proteases and cathepsins (29Adams J. Stein R. Annu. Rep. Med. Chem. 1996; 31: 279Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Thus we next examined the effects of lactacystin, a somewhat less potent but much more highly specific inhibitor of proteasome function (30Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 397-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar). Lactacystin, in contrast to MG132, did not detectably inhibit ligand-induced degradation of DOR (Fig. 1 C, upper panels) even though we used this compound at a high concentration (40 μm) that is in significant excess of that shown previously to strongly inhibit proteasome activity (31Schubert U. Ott D.E. Chertova E.N. Welker R. Tessmer U. Princiotta M.F. Bennink J.R. Krausslich H.G. Yewdell J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13057-13062Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that lactacystin can inhibit ubiquitin-dependent EGF-induced trafficking of EGF receptors to lysosomes (15Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 32Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, lactacystin significantly delayed ligand-induced proteolysis of EGF receptors when examined in parallel in the same cell clone (Fig. 1 C,lower panels). Lactacystin-mediated inhibition of EGF receptor degradation is thought to result from a net depletion of cytoplasmic free ubiquitin, thereby inhibiting ubiquitination of EGF receptors and perhaps other cellular proteins necessary for ubiquitin-dependent sorting of EGF receptors to lysosomes (15Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 31Schubert U. Ott D.E. Chertova E.N. Welker R. Tessmer U. Princiotta M.F. Bennink J.R. Krausslich H.G.

A. 2000; 97: 13069-13074Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, the inhibitory effect of this compound on EGF receptor but not DOR degradation suggested that DOR might be less dependent on ubiquitination than EGF receptor for its endocytic trafficking to lysosomes. The failure of lactacystin to inhibit ligand-induced proteolysis of DOR was confirmed in multiple experiments using densitometric scanning to quantify receptor degradation (Fig. 1 D).To test directly whether ubiquitination of DOR is required for its ligand-induced degradation, we constructed a mutant receptor in which all eight cytoplasmic lysine residues present in DOR were replaced by arginine (DOR-0cK mutant receptor, Fig. 2 A). This strategy prevents ubiquitination of receptors because protein ubiquitination occurs specifically on the ε-amino group of lysine (16Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 34Hicke L. Cell. 2001; 106: 527-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Lysine mutations of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and β2-adrenergic receptor have been shown to block receptor ubiquitination and also to strongly inhibit receptor sorting to lysosomes (16Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 17Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged versions of DOR and DOR-0cK were expressed at similar moderate levels (0.5–1 pmol/mg) in stably transfected HEK293 cells, expression levels at which DOR is efficiently sorted to lysosomes after ligand-induced endocytosis (5Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Fluorescence flow cytometry (35Keith D.E. Anton B. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C.

Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) indicated that both DOR and DOR-0cK were internalized rapidly following ligand-induced activation. Ligand-induced internalization of DOR-0cK was never inhibited relative to wild type DOR and was in fact moderately but consistently enhanced, an observation that was confirmed in multiple independent cell clones (Fig. 2 B). Analysis of the fate of endocytosed receptors by surface biotinylation (23Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. von Zastrow M. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) indicated that DOR was extensively proteolyzed within 2 h after endocytosis (Fig. 2 C,top panel) as reported previously (5Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Significantly, DOR-0cK exhibited similarly rapid and pronounced proteolysis after ligand-induced endocytosis despite the complete lack of potentially ubiquitinated lysine residues in its cytoplasmic domains (Fig. 2 C, bottom panel). Confirming these observations, ligand-induced degradation of the DOR-0cK mutant receptor was indistinguishable from that of DOR when quantified at two time points in multiple experiments (Fig. 2 D). These results suggest that ubiquitination of DOR is not required either for the initial endocytosis of receptors following ligand-induced activation or for their subsequent sorting to lysosomes.Figure 2Generation and analysis of DOR-0cK.

DOR and DOR-0cK were localized primarily in the plasma membrane in the absence of agonist and, consistent with previous studies (5Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 36Keith D.E. Murray S.R. Zaki P.A. Chu P.C. Lissin D.V. Kang L. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol.

Importantly, both DOR and DOR-0cK colocalized extensively with LAMP1 within 60 min after agonist addition (Fig. 3 A). The extensive colocalization of both DOR and DOR-0cK with individual LAMP1-positive compartments was emphasized by examination of cells at higher magnification (Fig. 3 B), confirming that both receptors were targeted to lysosomes under these conditions. In contrast, the μ opioid receptor examined under similar conditions was rarely observed in LAMP1-positive structures (not shown). This is consistent with the relatively inefficient lysosomal targeting of μ opioid receptors in these cells (21Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S. von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and confirmed the specificity of the observed colocalization.Figure 3Lysosomal targeting of DOR and DOR-0cK. A, colocalization of DOR and DOR-0cK with the lysosomal marker LAMP1 observed in a representative HEK293 cell fixed after a 60-min incubation in the presence of DADLE (10 μm).B, higher magnification of an area in A showing individual colocalized structures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Taken together the present results confirm that ligand-induced degradation of DOR occurring in this model cell system is mediated primarily by endocytic trafficking of receptors to lysosomes, and these results establish that lysosomal trafficking of opioid receptors can occur in the absence of covalent ubiquitination of the receptor protein. Ligand-induced degradation of DOR was not detectably inhibited by lactacystin under conditions that have been shown previously to inhibit ubiquitination and lysosomal trafficking of EGF receptors (15Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Moreover, ligand-induced proteolysis and lysosomal trafficking of DOR is not inhibited by mutation of all potentially ubiquitinated lysine residues present in the cytoplasmic domains of the receptor protein. Thus the present observations contrast with previous studies of other GPCRs and, to our knowledge, establish the first example of a mammalian GPCR whose endocytic trafficking to lysosomes does not require ubiquitination. This conclusion is consistent with recent studies suggesting an important role of non-covalent protein interactions in modulating the endocytic trafficking of a number of GPCRs (21Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S. von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 23Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D.

Cell. 2002; 13: 1965-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the observation that a cytosolic protein thought to modulate DOR trafficking to lysosomes can bind strongly to the non-ubiquitinated cytoplasmic tail of the receptor (21Whistler J.L. Enquist J. Marley A. Fong J. Gladher F. Tsuruda P. Murray S. von Zastrow M. Science. 2002; 297: 615-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). While our studies strongly argue that ubiquitination of the opioid receptor itself is not required for endocytic trafficking to lysosomes, we cannot exclude a potentially important role of ubiquitination of another cytosolic protein in mediating DOR trafficking. Indeed, studies of ligand-induced endocytic trafficking of EGF receptors indicate that there exists a major fraction of ubiquitinated proteins associated with the endocytic membrane that are distinct from the receptor itself yet may be required for endocytic trafficking of receptors to lysosomes (15Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Thus further studies will be necessary to fully elucidate the mechanism mediating lysosomal sorting of non-ubiquitinated opioid receptors, to determine the relationship of this mechanism to the highly conserved mechanisms mediating lysosomal sorting of ubiquitinated membrane cargo, and to examine the functional consequences of these apparent differences in mechanisms mediating regulated proteolysis of GPCRs. Classical studies of receptor-mediated endocytosis established the principle of geometric sorting whereby membrane-bound receptors recycle to the plasma membrane by bulk membrane flow and require specific membrane sorting machinery to traffic to lysosomes (1Gruenberg J. Maxfield F.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 552-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 2Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 575-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (1331) Google Scholar, 3Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Although many signaling receptors are endocytosed after ligand-induced activation, there are large differences in the degree to which various receptors thereafter traffic to lysosomes. Such differences in the endocytic trafficking of receptors have important functional consequences (4Waterman H. Yarden Y. FEBS Lett. 2001; 490: 142-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 5Tsao P.I. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11130-11140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 6Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In the case of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 events surrounding the initial endocytosis of receptors generally result in a rapid desensitization of signaling activity. Recycling of receptors back to the plasma membrane typically promotes functional resensitization, whereas sorting of internalized receptors to lysosomes leads to proteolytic down-regulation of receptors and a prolonged attenuation of signal transduction (7Ferguson S.S. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Life Sci. 1998; 62: 1561-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 8Lefkowitz R.J. Pitcher J. Krueger K. Daaka Y. Adv.

These considerations have motivated considerable interest in elucidating mechanisms that control the sorting of specific signaling receptors in the endocytic pathway. Covalent modification of lysine residues by ubiquitin is well known to function as a signal targeting many proteins to proteasomes. Ubiquitination of cytoplasmic lysine residues has emerged more recently as a mechanism that also regulates the endocytic trafficking of various integral membrane proteins (10Hicke L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of lysine residues located in the carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the yeast GPCR Ste2p was initially shown to promote ligand-induced endocytosis of receptors (11Hicke L. Riezman H. Cell. 1996; 84: 277-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). More recently, ubiquitination of the cytoplasmic tail of Ste2p (12Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) has been shown to be essential for the subsequent sorting of endocytosed receptors to internal structures of the vacuole via a mechanism involving ubiquitin-dependent protein interactions occurring on the endosomal membrane (12Shih S.C. Katzmann D.J. Schnell J.D. Sutanto M. Emr S.D. Hicke L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 13Babst M. Odorizzi G. Estepa E.J. Emr S.D. Traffic. 2000; 1: 248-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination of receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF receptor plays an analogous role in sorting of internalized receptors to lysosomes in mammalian cells (14Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Zamir E. Kam Z. Oved S. Langdon W.Y. Beguinot L. Geiger B. Yarden Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3663-3674Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar, 15Bishop N. Horman A. Woodman P. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Recent studies of the CXCR4 chemokine receptor and β2-adrenergic receptor provide strong evidence that ubiquitination of cytoplasmic lysine residues is also essential for lysosomal trafficking of certain mammalian GPCRs (16Marchese A. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45509-45512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 17Shenoy S.K. McDonald P.H. Kohout T.A. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1307-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Opioid receptors comprise a subfamily of mammalian GPCRs that transduce the physiological effects of endogenously produced neuropeptides as well as exogenously administered alkaloid analgesic drugs. The δ opioid receptor (DOR) is regulated by ligand-induced endocytosis followed by postendocytic trafficking to lysosomes in several cell types (18Koch T. Schulz S. Schröder H. Wolf R. Raulf E.

Ubiquitination of opioid receptors in the biosynthetic pathway has been shown to target DOR to proteasomes from the endoplasmic reticulum (22Petaj"
https://openalex.org/W2129520501,"TSG-6 protein (the secreted product of the tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6), a hyaluronan-binding protein comprised mainly of a Link and CUB module arranged in a contiguous fashion, has been shown previously to be a potent inhibitor of neutrophil migration in an in vivo model of acute inflammation (Wisniewski, H. G., Hua, J. C., Poppers, D. M., Naime, D., Vilcek, J., and Cronstein, B. N. (1996)J. Immunol. 156, 1609–1615). It was hypothesized that this activity of TSG-6 was likely to be mediated by its potentiation of inter-α-inhibitor anti-plasmin activity (causing a down-regulation of the protease network), which was reliant on these proteins forming a stable, probably covalent ∼120-kDa complex. Here we have shown that the recombinant Link module from human TSG-6 (Link_TSG6; expressed inEscherichia coli) has an inhibitory effect on neutrophil influx into zymosan A-stimulated murine air pouches, equivalent to that of full-length protein (which we produced in a Drosophilaexpression system). The active dose of 1 μg of Link_TSG6 per mouse (administered intravenously) also resulted in a significant reduction in the concentrations of various inflammatory mediators (i.e. tumor necrosis factor-α, KC, and prostaglandin E2) in air pouch exudates. Link_TSG6, although unable to form a stable complex with inter-α-inhibitor (under conditions that promote maximum complex formation with the full-length protein), could potentiate its anti-plasmin activity. This demonstrates that formation of an ∼120-kDa TSG-6·inter-α-inhibitor complex is not required for TSG-6 to enhance the serine protease inhibitory activity of inter-α-inhibitor. Six single-site Link_TSG6 mutants (with wild-type folds) were compared for their abilities to inhibit neutrophil migration in vivo, bind hyaluronan, and potentiate inter-α-inhibitor. These experiments indicate that all of the inhibitory activity of TSG-6 resides within the Link module domain, and that this anti-inflammatory property is not related to either its hyaluronan binding function or its potentiation of the anti-plasmin activity of inter-α-inhibitor.

These pro-migratory events need to be balanced by the production of endogenous inhibitors of extravasation (3Perretti M. Trends Pharmacol.

This is particularly relevant to polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs),1 which only migrate from the vasculature in inflammation; neutrophil accumulation into specific organs is a major cause of tissue damage associated with rheumatoid arthritis and cardiovascular pathologies such as ischemia/reperfusion injury and septic shock (5Ricevuti G.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar); IαI is a serine protease inhibitor found at high levels in serum (see Ref. 21Mizon C. Balduyck M. Albani D. Michalski C. Burnouf T. Mizon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 190: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). TSG-6·IαI complexes of this size have been detected in vivo, for instance in synovial fluids from rheumatoid arthritis patients (11Wisniewski H.G. Maier R. Lotz M. Lee S. Klampfer L. Lee T.H.

Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar); plasmin has an important role in the proteinase cascade activated during inflammation that results in extracellular matrix degradation and cellular infiltration (see Refs. 2Plow E.F.

Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 143-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Wisniewskiet al. suggest that the inhibition of neutrophil migration by TSG-6 in vivo is mediated by its potentiation of IαI anti-plasmin activity (8Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar), i.e. via the down-regulation of the protease network. This hypothesis was based on the detection of a 120-kDa TSG-6·IαI complex in mouse air pouch exudates (after treatment with recombinant TSG-6) and the results from experiments with two mutants of the full-length protein (i.e.TSG-6E41K and TSG-6K48E) that had corresponding effects on both PMN infiltration and potentiation of IαI (8Wisniewski H.G.

Previously, we have expressed the Link module from human TSG-6 in Escherichia coli (28Day A.J. Aplin R.T. Willis A.C. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and used this material (denoted Link_TSG6) to solve its tertiary structure (29Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A.

Site-directed mutagenesis of Link_TSG6 identified five amino acids clustered on one face of the Link module as having an important role in HA binding (26Mahoney D.J. Blundell C.D. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22764-22771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Recently, we identified a novel allele of the human TSG-6 gene (A431 (27Nentwich H.A. Mustafa Z. Rugg M.S. Marsden B.D. Cordell M.R. Mahoney D.J. Jenkins S.C. Dowling B. Fries E. Milner C.M. Loughlin J. Day A.J. J. Biol.

Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar); the A431 variant is the major allele in Caucasians. Molecular modeling of the CUB domain (where this amino acid polymorphism is located) indicated that this residue is likely to be solvent-exposed and could lead to functional differences in HA binding and/or formation of TSG-6·IαI complexes (27Nentwich H.A. Mustafa Z. Rugg M.S. Marsden B.D. Cordell M.R. Mahoney D.J. Jenkins S.C. Dowling B. Fries E. Milner C.M. Loughlin J. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15354-15362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Expression of the Arg-144 and Gln-144 allotypes (denoted here as TSG-6R and TSG-6Q, respectively) in aDrosophila-based system and functional characterization showed that there were no significant differences in the ability of these full-length proteins to bind HA or form a stable complex with IαI (27Nentwich H.A. Mustafa Z. Rugg M.S. Marsden B.D. Cordell M.R. Mahoney D.J. Jenkins S.C. Dowling B. Fries E. Milner C.M. Loughlin J. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15354-15362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Here we have found that Link_TSG6 is a potent inhibitor of neutrophil migration in vivo. Link_TSG6 has an equivalent effect to the full-length protein in a murine air pouch model, indicating that all of the inhibitory activity of TSG-6 is located within the Link module domain; the TSG-6R and TSG-6Q allotypes exhibit no significant difference in their inhibition of neutrophil migration. Link_TSG6, although unable to form a covalent complex with IαI (under conditions that promote maximum complex formation with full-length TSG-6), can potentiate the anti-plasmin activity of IαI. This demonstrates that formation of a ∼120-kDa TSG-6·IαI complex is not required for TSG-6 to enhance the serine protease inhibitory activity of IαI. Six single-site mutants of Link_TSG6 (with wild-type folds) were compared for their abilities to inhibit PMN influx in vivo, bind HA, and potentiate IαI. Results from these experiments indicate that the inhibition of neutrophil migration by TSG-6 is not related to either its HA binding function or its potentiation of the anti-plasmin activity of IαI.DISCUSSIONA novel finding of this study is that the isolated Link module from human TSG-6 (Link_TSG6) is a potent inhibitor of PMN migrationin vivo. Link_TSG6 showed a similar effect to that of the full-length protein in the zymosan-stimulated air pouch model in two different mouse strains (see Fig. 1); for example, in T.O. mice 183 pmol of Link_TSG6 caused 41 ± 7% inhibition, whereas 200 pmol of TSG-6 proteins gave between 41 ± 8 and 46 ± 9% reduction in neutrophil influx. These results indicate that all of the inhibitory activity of TSG-6 is likely to reside within the Link module domain.Dose-dependent reduction in neutrophil influx was seen in the zymosan air pouch model when Link_TSG6 was given intravenously (Fig. 1 A); denatured protein was inactive, indicating that its anti-inflammatory effect is reliant on the Link module being correctly folded. As little as 1 μg (92 pmol) per mouse had a significant effect when administered intravenously into the tail vein or subcutaneously at a site remote from the air pouch (34 ± 7 and 35 ± 10%, respectively). This suggests that for Link_TSG6 to exert its effect, it does not need to be local to the site of inflammation but, rather, acts via the circulation. Consistent with this notion, Link_TSG6 (at the active dose of 1 μg/mouse) also caused similar neutrophil inhibition in IL-1β-stimulated air pouches when it was injected either intravenously or directly into the air pouch (43 ± 5 and 43 ± 9%, respectively; Fig. 3). In addition, this dose of Link_TSG6 could attenuate the effects of IL-1β and fMLP in a skin model of PMN migration (Fig. 4). These results demonstrate that the inhibitory activity of Link_TSG6 on neutrophil migration is not limited to a single site or inflammatory stimulus.Here we tested two allotypes of TSG-6 that differ by a single amino acid (i.e. TSG-6Q, a newly discovered variant with a Gln at residue 144 in the preprotein (27Nentwich H.A. Mustafa Z. Rugg M.S. Marsden B.D. Cordell M.R. Mahoney D.J. Jenkins S.C. Dowling B. Fries E. Milner C.M. Loughlin J. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15354-15362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and TSG-6R, which has an Arg at this position, as described in the original published sequence (7Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar)). We found that TSG-6Q and TSG-6R (expressed in Drosophila S2 cells (27Nentwich H.A. Mustafa Z. Rugg M.S. Marsden B.D. Cordell M.R. Mahoney D.J. Jenkins S.C. Dowling B. Fries E. Milner C.M. Loughlin J. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15354-15362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar)) had similar activities in vivo at doses of 100 pmol (T.O. mice, 38 ± 7 and 48 ± 6% inhibition, respectively; BALB/c mice, 75 ± 4 and 67 ± 3%, respectively) and 200 pmol (T.O. mice, 41 ± 8% and 46 ± 9%, respectively) per mouse (intravenously). These data indicate that there is no significant difference in the activities of these allotypes with respect to neutrophil migration. To date we have been unable to find any functional difference between TSG-6R and TSG-6Q (see Ref.27Nentwich H.A. Mustafa Z. Rugg M.S. Marsden B.D. Cordell M.R. Mahoney D.J. Jenkins S.C. Dowling B. Fries E. Milner C.M. Loughlin J. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15354-15362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Our experiments with full-length recombinant TSG-6 confirm the earlier finding from Wisniewski et al. (8Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar) that TSG-6 is a potent inhibitor of PMN infiltration in vivo; this was observed using human TSG-6R, expressed using a baculovirus system, in an essentially identical model (i.e. carrageenan- or IL-1β-inflamed murine air pouches (8Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar)). However, in the Wisniewski study maximum inhibition (∼38% reduction in PMN influx) was seen with TSG-6R at a dose of 20 μg in carrageenan-stimulated air pouches, whereas we observed a 67 ± 3% inhibition with 3 μg (100 pmol) TSG-6R (intravenously) in the same mouse strain (i.e.BALB/c). Thus, the full-length TSG-6R protein used here appears much more potent than that described previously (approximately 10 times more active). There are several possible explanations for this. First, it could result from a genuine difference in the specific activities of the recombinant protein used in the two studies. However, this seems somewhat unlikely given that the full-length proteins were both produced in insect cell-based secretion systems. A second possibility is that the difference results from the site of TSG-6 administration (directly into the air pouch in (8Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar) and intravenous here). This also seems unlikely because we found no significant difference in inhibition of IL-1β-elicited neutrophil infiltration when Link_TSG6 was injected directly into the air pouch or given systemically (Fig. 3). It should be noted that in the IL-1β model, treatment with ∼660 pmol of TSG-6R (injected into the air pouch) inhibited PMN migration by 32% (8Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar), whereas we observed 43 ± 9% inhibition with 92 pmol of Link_TSG6 (into air pouch). Therefore, a large difference in inhibitory effect is seen in the two studies using an identical route of administration and the same inflammatory stimulator, albeit in a different mouse strain. A third possible explanation relates to the formulation of the recombinant proteins. The full-length TSG-6R used in the Wisniewski study was purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography providing protein that was ≥95% pure in 20 mm MES, pH 6.5, 500 mm NaCl (10Wisniewski H.G. Burgess W.H. Oppenheim J.D. Vilcek J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7423-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This high salt preparation was diluted with saline before being injected into the air pouch. In our study, the full-length TSG-6 allotypes were purified by a combination of ion exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC, allowing the production of lyophilized protein that is salt-free (27Nentwich H.A. Mustafa Z. Rugg M.S. Marsden B.D. Cordell M.R. Mahoney D.J. Jenkins S.C. Dowling B. Fries E. Milner C.M. Loughlin J. Day A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15354-15362Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It seems possible that the different salt concentrations of the protein preparations used in vivocould account for the difference in potency.Six single site mutants of Link_TSG6 (i.e. H4K, E6K, Y12F, K13E, F70V, and Y78F) demonstrated to have wild-type folds were tested for their ability to inhibit neutrophil migration in vivo(Fig. 5), bind HA (Fig. 6), and potentiate the anti-plasmin activity of IαI (Fig. 8); these data are summarized in Table I. The fact that there is no obvious correlation between any of these activities indicates that the effect of Link_TSG6 on neutrophil migration is not dependent on HA binding nor is it mediated via potentiation of IαI. As discussed below, this latter conclusion is quite different from that made by Wisniewski et al. (8Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar).Previously, it has been suggested that inhibition of neutrophil migration by TSG-6 occurs via its potentiation of the anti-plasmin activity of IαI. This is a reasonable hypothesis given the importance of plasmin in local extracellular matrix degradation (both directly and by its up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase activity), which is associated with cellular infiltration. These two properties were linked because a 120-kDa TSG-6·IαI complex was detected in murine air pouch exudates after treatment with TSG-6R (albeit at low levels compared with free TSG-6) and because of the finding that two mutants of TSG-6R (i.e.TSG-6E41K and TSG-6K48E, which were expressed in insect cells) had corresponding effects on PMN infiltration and potentiation of IαI (these activities were significantly reduced or abolished, respectively). Here we have found that the equivalent Link_TSG6 mutants (E6K and K13E, respectively) have very different properties (see Figs. 5 and 8, and Table I). Neither mutation caused any impairment in the inhibition of neutrophil migration in vivo (124 and 143% of WT Link_TSG6, respectively). In addition, K13E (at pH 6.0 and pH 7.4) and E6K (at pH 6.0) had wild-type activities in the plasmin assay. The reason for these differences is not clear. It should be noted, however, that here we characterized our Link_TSG6 mutants by NMR spectroscopy, whereas no such structural analysis was carried out in the study of Wisniewski et al.(8Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible therefore that these Glu → Lys and Lys → Glu mutations, when expressed in the context of full-length TSG-6, adversely affect the folding of the protein.If indeed the inhibitory effect of TSG-6 on neutrophil migration is not connected to its ability to down-regulate the protease network (as our data suggest), then what is the mechanism of its action? One possibility is that TSG-6 could affect some aspect of PMN adhesion/extravasation (e.g. attachment and rolling, tight adhesion, or transendothelial migration). Work is currently in progress to investigate the effect of TSG-6 on these processes using intravital microscopy on the mouse mesenteric microcirculation. 5T. Cao, A. J. Day, and M. Perretti, manuscript in preparation.Given the finding that Link_TSG6 can inhibit PMN infiltration in more than one model of inflammation (see “Results”), it seems likely that native TSG-6 may be involved in the regulation of neutrophil migration in vivo. In this regard, TSG-6 expression is rapidly induced in many different cell types in response to inflammatory mediators, and the protein has been detected in inflammatory conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis and septic shock) as well as being up-regulated in inflammation-like processes such as ovulation (see the Introduction). Here we have shown for the first time that TSG-6 treatment in vivo results in a reduction in the levels of inflammatory mediators (i.e.TNF-α, KC, and PGE2; see Fig. 2) in addition to inhibiting PMN migration. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis proposed by Wisniewski et al. (8Wisniewski H.G. Hua J.C. Poppers D.M. Naime D. Vilcek J. Cronstein B.N. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1609-1615PubMed Google Scholar) that endogenous TSG-6 can be part of a negative feedback loop in the inflammatory response. The recruitment of leukocytes from the blood to sites of injury/inflammation is a vital component of host defense; this involves tethering to and rolling on the vascular endothelium, activation by chemokines, tight adhesion, and transendothelial migration (1Dunon D. Piali L. Imhof B.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 714-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Differential expression and/or activation of adhesion molecules and triggering of the protease network (2Plow E.F. Herren T. Redlitz A. Miles L.A. Hoover-Plow J.L. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) promote the migration of specific leukocyte subpopulations to a given site. These pro-migratory events need to be balanced by the production of endogenous inhibitors of extravasation (3Perretti M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 418-425PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 4Getting S.J. Gibbs L. Clark"
https://openalex.org/W2061967227,"GPR7 and GPR8 are two structurally related orphan G protein-coupled receptors, presenting high similarities with opioid and somatostatin receptors. Two peptides, L8 and L8C, derived from a larger precursor, were recently described as natural ligands for GPR8 (Mori, M., Shimomura, Y., Harada, M., Kurihara, M., Kitada, C., Asami, T., Matsumoto, Y., Adachi, Y., Watanabe, T., Sugo, T., and Abe, M. (December, 27, 2001) World Patent Cooperation Treaty, Patent Application WO 01/98494A1). L8 is a 23-amino acid peptide, whereas L8C is the same peptide with a C terminus extension of 7 amino acids, running through a dibasic motif of proteolytic processing. Using as a query the amino acid sequence of the L8 peptide, we have identified in DNA databases a human gene predicted to encode related peptides and its mouse ortholog. By analogy with L8 and L8C, two peptides, named L7 and L7C could result from the processing of a 125-amino acid human precursor through the alternative usage of a dibasic amino acid motif. The activity of these four peptides was investigated on GPR7 and GPR8. In binding assays, L7, L7C, L8, and L8C were found to bind with low nanomolar affinities to the GPR7 and GPR8 receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells. They inhibited forskolin-stimulated cAMP accumulation through a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. The tissue distribution of prepro-L7 (ppL7) and prepro-L8 (ppL8) was investigated by reverse transcription-PCR. Abundant ppL7 transcripts were found throughout the brain as well as in spinal cord, spleen, testis, and placenta; ppL8 transcripts displayed a more restricted distribution in brain, with high levels in substantia nigra, but were more abundant in peripheral tissues. The ppL7 and ppL8 genes therefore encode the precursors of a class of peptide ligands, active on two receptor subtypes, GPR7 and GPR8. The distinct tissue distribution of the receptor and peptide precursors suggest that each ligand and receptor has partially overlapping but also specific roles in this signaling system."
https://openalex.org/W2147461630,"Mercaptopurine and thioguanine, two of the most widely used antileukemic agents, exert their cytotoxic, therapeutic effects by being incorporated into DNA as deoxy-6-thioguanosine. However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which incorporation of these thiopurines into DNA translates into cytotoxicity is unknown. The solution structure of thioguanine-modified duplex DNA presented here shows that the effects of the modification on DNA structure were subtle and localized to the modified base pair. Specifically, thioguanine existed in the keto form, formed weakened Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds with cytosine and caused a modest ∼10° opening of the modified base pair toward the major groove. In contrast, thioguanine significantly altered base pair dynamics, causing an ∼80-fold decrease in the base pair lifetime with cytosine compared with normal guanine. This perturbation was consistent with the ∼6 °C decrease in DNA melting temperature of the modified oligonucleotide, the 1.13 ppm upfield shift of the thioguanine imino proton resonance, and the large increase in the exchange rate of the thioguanine imino proton with water. Our studies provide new mechanistic insight into the effects of thioguanine incorporation into DNA at the level of DNA structure and dynamics, provide explanations for the effects of thioguanine incorporation on the activity of DNA-processing enzymes, and provide a molecular basis for the specific recognition of thioguanine-substituted sites by proteins. These combined effects likely cooperate to produce the cellular responses that underlie the therapeutic effects of thiopurines."
https://openalex.org/W2081410303,"Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) regulates both HCO3−secretion and HCO3− salvage in secretory epithelia. At least two luminal transporters mediate HCO3− salvage, the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3) and the Na+-HCO3− cotransport (NBC3). In a previous work, we show that CFTR interacts with NHE3 to regulate its activity (Ahn, W., Kim, K. W., Lee, J. A., Kim, J. Y., Choi, J. Y., Moe, O. M., Milgram, S. L., Muallem, S., and Lee, M. G. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 17236–17243). In this work, we report that transient or stable expression of human NBC3 (hNBC3) in HEK cells resulted in a Na+-dependent, DIDS (4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid)- and 5-ethylisopropylamiloride-insensitive HCO3−transport. Stimulation of CFTR with forskolin markedly inhibited NBC3 activity. This inhibition was prevented by the inhibition of protein kinase A. NBC3 and CFTR could be reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated from transfected HEK cells and from the native pancreas and submandibular and parotid glands. Precipitation of NBC3 or CFTR from transfected HEK293 cells and from the pancreas and submandibular gland also coimmunoprecipitated EBP50. GlutathioneS-transferase-EBP50 pulled down CFTR and hNBC3 from cell lysates when expressed individually and as a complex when expressed together. Notably, the deletion of the C-terminal PDZ binding motifs of CFTR or hNBC3 prevented coimmunoprecipitation of the proteins and inhibition of hNBC3 activity by CFTR. We conclude that CFTR and NBC3 reside in the same HCO3−-transporting complex with the aid of PDZ domain-containing scaffolds, and this interaction is essential for regulation of NBC3 activity by CFTR. Furthermore, these findings add additional evidence for the suggestion that CFTR regulates the overall trans-cellular HCO3− transport by regulating the activity of all luminal HCO3− secretion and salvage mechanisms of secretory epithelial cells. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) regulates both HCO3−secretion and HCO3− salvage in secretory epithelia. At least two luminal transporters mediate HCO3− salvage, the Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE3) and the Na+-HCO3− cotransport (NBC3). In a previous work, we show that CFTR interacts with NHE3 to regulate its activity (Ahn, W., Kim, K. W., Lee, J. A., Kim, J. Y., Choi, J. Y., Moe, O. M., Milgram, S. L., Muallem, S., and Lee, M. G.

In this work, we report that transient or stable expression of human NBC3 (hNBC3) in HEK cells resulted in a Na+-dependent, DIDS (4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid)- and 5-ethylisopropylamiloride-insensitive HCO3−transport. Stimulation of CFTR with forskolin markedly inhibited NBC3 activity. This inhibition was prevented by the inhibition of protein kinase A. NBC3 and CFTR could be reciprocally coimmunoprecipitated from transfected HEK cells and from the native pancreas and submandibular and parotid glands. Precipitation of NBC3 or CFTR from transfected HEK293 cells and from the pancreas and submandibular gland also coimmunoprecipitated EBP50. GlutathioneS-transferase-EBP50 pulled down CFTR and hNBC3 from cell lysates when expressed individually and as a complex when expressed together. Notably, the deletion of the C-terminal PDZ binding motifs of CFTR or hNBC3 prevented coimmunoprecipitation of the proteins and inhibition of hNBC3 activity by CFTR. We conclude that CFTR and NBC3 reside in the same HCO3−-transporting complex with the aid of PDZ domain-containing scaffolds, and this interaction is essential for regulation of NBC3 activity by CFTR. Furthermore, these findings add additional evidence for the suggestion that CFTR regulates the overall trans-cellular HCO3− transport by regulating the activity of all luminal HCO3− secretion and salvage mechanisms of secretory epithelial cells. cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR from which the PDZ binding motif was deleted Na+-HCO3− cotransporter human Na+-HCO3− cotransport isoform 3 hNBC3 from which the PDZ binding motif was deleted 5-ethylisopropylamiloride luminal membrane coimmunoprecipitation green fluorescent protein submandibular gland Na+/H+ exchanger 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2′-disulfonic acid phosphate-buffered saline analysis of variance wild type Ezrin-Radixin-Moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 HCO3− concentration is tightly controlled in all biological fluids including fluids secreted by exocrine glands. The ductal systems or their equivalents are the sites of active regulation of HCO3− content of the secreted fluids. This is also the site of expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR)1 (1Zeng W. Lee M.G. Yan M. Diaz J. Benjamin I. Marino C.R. Kopito R. Freedman S. Cotton C.

The transporters participating in ductal HCO3− homeostasis and their regulation are only partially known. Probably, the best results are available in the salivary glands and pancreatic ducts. Active regulation of luminal HCO3−concentration and pHi requires the regulation of both HCO3− secretory and absorptive mechanisms. HCO3− secretion is believed to occur by HCO3− influx across the basolateral membrane mediated by a Na+-HCO3− cotransport mechanism (6Zhao H. Star R.A. Muallem S. J. Gen.

These findings prompted us to test the regulatory interaction between CFTR and NBC3. We report here that the expression of hNBC3 in HEK293 cells resulted in a DIDS- and EIPA-insensitive, Na+-dependent HCO3− transport. When expressed in the same cells, the stimulation of CFTR inhibited Na+-HCO3− cotransport by hNBC3. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and pull-down assays indicate that the two proteins interact with each other with the aid of PDZ scaffolds. Co-IP and inhibition of hNBC3 activity by CFTR required an intact PDZ binding motif in both proteins. We propose that activated CFTR inhibits NBC3 activity by mutual binding to a scaffolding protein containing PDZ binding domains. In this manner, CFTR is able to regulate another portion of the HCO3− secretory/absorptive function of secretory epithelia.

We furthermore show that their substrate, dihydroxyacetone (DHA), is toxic to yeast cells and that the detoxification is dependent on functional DAK. The importance of DAK was clearly apparent for cells where both isogenes were deleted (dak1Δdak2Δ), since this strain was highly sensitive to DHA. In the opposite case, overexpression of either DAK1 or DAK2 made thedak1Δdak2Δ highly resistant to DHA. In fact, overexpression of either DAK provided cells with the capacity to grow efficiently on DHA as the only carbon and energy source, with a generation time of about 5 h. The DHA toxicity was shown to be strongly dependent on the carbon and energy source utilized, since glucose efficiently suppresses the lethality, whereas galactose or ethanol did so to a much lesser extent. However, this suppression was found not to be explained by differences in DHA uptake, since uptake kinetics revealed a simple diffusion mechanism with similar capacity independent of carbon source. Salt addition strongly aggravated the DHA toxicity, independent of carbon source. Furthermore, the DHA toxicity was not linked to the presence of oxygen or to the known harmful agents methylglyoxal and formaldehyde.

This is especially true for microbes, which frequently encounter drastic environmental changes. An understanding of these stress mechanisms will provide information about both the metabolic features activated under nonoptimal growth conditions as well as novel insights into mechanisms relevant to basal physiology. Cellular effects from environmental stress currently represent a vividly studied field, and our understanding of quite a number of stress adaptation mechanisms has lately been substantially deepened (1Pearce A.K. Humphrey T.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 426-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 2Grant C.M. Mol.

Microbiology. 2001; 147: 2635-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Many of the gene responders characterized have an easily understandable functional role that is more or less specific for the type of stress applied, which can be exemplified by the glutaredoxin gene GLR1 for adaptation to oxidative stress conditions (2Grant C.M. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) or GPD1, which has been shown to be instrumental for survival and growth in saline media (5Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). However, for many of these stress genes, the cellular importance appears to be of a more general nature, since their expression is reported regulated under many different stresses (6Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4241-4257Crossref PubMed Scopus (3763) Google Scholar, 7Causton H.C. Ren B. Koh S.S.

This indicates that the processes in which the encoded proteins participate apparently will be of general importance during diverse cellular disturbances. One example of a gene that appears to be involved in a metabolic pathway central to stress adaptation in general is the putative dihydroxyacetone kinase (DAK)1 geneYML070W/DAK1, since this gene is up-regulated under a large number of environmental conditions. This protein was first identified as a stress responder in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae while exponentially growing in saline media (8Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol.

U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1486-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar)). However, the cellular role of this protein under these conditions is less clear. Its induction during saline conditions was surprising, considering the prominent production and accumulation of glycerol under these conditions (14Blomberg A. Adler L. Adv. Microbial Phys. 1992; 33: 145-212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The identification of a similarly salt-regulated putative glycerol dehydrogenase led us to propose salt-induced glycerol dissimilation via the DHA path (8Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Under conditions of salt stress, an activation of this pathway would counteract the stress-induced accumulation of the osmolyte glycerol, which appears absolutely essential under these conditions. Thus, different rationales for the increased expression of DAK were proposed (8Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar): (i) the protein is involved in fine tuning of glycerol accumulation and thus constitutes an alternative route for pool regulation besides production and controlled excretion via the glycerol facilitator Fps1p, and (ii) the protein is involved in a stress-induced transhydrogenase cycle. This was based on the fact that the putative glycerol dehydrogenase has sequence similarities to the fungal NADPH-dependent enzyme, whereas Gpd1p is NADH-dependent. An alternative rationale was later proposed, which placed DAK as a component in an ATP futile cycle activated under stress conditions, which was involved in balancing the ATP pool and being mainly important under cellular adaptation to stress (15Blomberg A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 182: 1-8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we characterize the putative DAK genesYML070W/DAK1 andYFL053W/DAK2 in the yeast S. cerevisiae, with a combined genetic and biochemical approach. In doing so, we have shown that theses genes indeed encode dihydroxyacetone kinases with high affinity for the substrate DHA and that these enzymes appear to play an important role in the detoxification mechanisms involved in maintaining a low intracellular concentration of DHA. We propose that detoxification of DHA is a vital part of mechanisms of general importance in stress physiology in many species. Genotypes of all yeast strains used in this study can be found in TableI. Standard molecular genetic and yeast genetic methods were used throughout. The DAK1 gene was deleted in a diploid wild type of W303 (16Thomas B.J. Rothstein R. Cell. 1989; 56: 619-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Stefan Hohmann) using the long flanking homology region method to replace the major part of the ORF with the KanMX4 cassette (17Wach A. Yeast. 1996; 12: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), and theDAK2 gene was similarly deleted in a W303 diploid using the HIS3MX6 cassette (18Wach A. Brachat A. Alberti-Segui C.

After selection for G418 resistance (200 μg/ml) or histidine prototrophy, the strain yJN001 (W303, MATa,DAK1Δ::KanMX4) was crossed with yJN008 (W303, MATα,DAK2Δ::HIS3MX6) to produce the diploid strain yJN009–2n. This diploid was sporulated, several tetrads were dissected, and one tetrad was selected, which contained yJN009-1A, yJN009-1B, yJN009-1C, and yJN009-1D (Table I). These strains were used in subsequent experiments. DAK1 and DAK2 ORFs were amplified from genomic DNA derived from strain yJN009-1A using the Expand long template PCR kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to recommendations from the manufacturer. PCR primer sequences were as follows: DAK1 forward (5′-CATGCATGCCATGG CCGCTAAATCGTTTGAAGTCACAGAT-3′), DAK1 reverse (5′-CATGCATGGAGCTCGTACTTACAAGGCGCTTTGAACCCCCTTCAA-3′), DAK2 forward (5′-GTCAGAATTCATCATGTCTCACAAACAATTC-3′), and DAK2 reverse (5′-CTGATGCTAGCTGTTATGTTTGGCTTCTAGT-3′). In sequences shown above, added restriction sites are marked in boldface type, and translation start/stop sites are underlined. To theDAK1 forward primer, a NcoI site was added 5′ of the open reading frame. In creating this, the second codon was changed from TCC to GCC, as indicated in italics, resulting in a shift from a serine to an alanine in the second amino acid residue of the expressed protein. The reverse primer contained a SacI site 3′ of the ORF. DAK2 was amplified from 3 base pairs upstream of the ATG translation to 37 base pairs downstream of the translation stop withEcoRI and NheI sites added to the upstream and downstream primers, respectively. The PCR-amplified, digested, and agarose gel-purified DAK1 ORF was cloned into the multicopy plasmid pYX212 (R&D Systems Inc.) polylinker following theTPI1 promoter. This produced the plasmid pYX212-DAK1. TheDAK2 ORF was digested and cloned into pYX212 to make the plasmid pYX212-DAK2. Clones containing the correct inserts, as evidenced by multiple restriction enzyme digestion patterns and sequencing, were amplified and used to transform S. cerevisiae strain yJN009-1D using the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method. The obtained strains yMM006 and yMM007 (Table I) were saved for further analyses. Strains yMM004 and yMM005 were made by transforming strains yJN009-1A and yJN009-1D, respectively, with pYX212. Sequences obtained for DAK1 and DAK2, when using strain W303 as a template, were identical to the published sequences, with the exception of a one-nucleotide conflict inDAK2, resulting in a proline instead of a serine at position 350. The DAK2 gene was later on cloned by PCR using the BY strain as a template, and the sequence obtained was in this case identical to the published sequence. Most importantly, the two Dak2 proteins appear functionally similar, since either a proline or a serine at position 350 produced transformants that grew identically on DHA as the sole carbon and energy source and the produced proteins were indistinguishable as far as specific activity and kinetics (K m and V max) are concerned (data not shown). It should also be noted that position 350 in Dak2p corresponds to a nonconserved region in the protein as revealed by its multiple alignment to DAKs from other species, further giving support to this position's low functional importance. The construction and use of the GLO1 overexpression and disruption plasmids (pE24-GLO1 and pIGLK0a, respectively) have been reported earlier (19Inoue Y. Kimura A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25958-25965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and were kindly provided by Dr. Yoshiharu Inoue. Strain yJN201 was constructed by transforming strain yJN009-1A with the XbaI-digested plasmid pIGLKOa and selecting for uracil prototrophy. Strain yJN202 was similarly made by transforming strain yJN009-1A with the undigested plasmid pE24-GLO1. To obtain strain yJN203, strains yJN201 and yJN009-1D were mated, and obtained diploids were sporulated (TableI). A total of 24 tetrads were dissected and screened for the cosegregation of G418 resistance and uracil/histidine prototrophy. Strains used for testing DHA tolerance of pentose pathway mutants were all derivatives of strain BY4742 (20Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E., Li, J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar) originating from the collection of systematic deletions of all yeast gene ORFs (21Winzeler E.A. Shoemaker D.D. Astromoff A.

Cultures were grown in defined minimal medium (0.17% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium sulfate) supplemented with 2% (w/v) glucose, 0.5% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4, and the appropriate amino acids or nucleotides (120 mg/ml). Where indicated, the appropriate amounts of dihydroxyacetone or NaCl were added to the medium. In some cases YPD complex medium (1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose) was used. Solid medium was made by adding 2% (w/v) agar. Precultures of 5 ml were grown in 14-ml plastic tubes (Falcon) overnight at 30 °C on a rotator. Larger precultures and most ordinary cultures were grown in E-flasks with rotary agitation, 110 rpm, at 30 °C. Cultures were inoculated to an OD610 of 0.07 (roughly 1 × 106 cells/ml), and growth was followed over time. Larger culture volumes were grown in Fernbach flasks. The assay for dihydroxyacetone kinase activity was essentially performed as described earlier (8Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22Gancedo C. Llobell A. Ribas J.C. Luchi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 159: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Extracts for the assays were made as previously described (8Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) using cells harvested from 100 ml of culture grown to midexponential phase (OD610 of 0.35) (or from 200 ml of culture incubated for 55 h in the case of activity measurements of yJN009-1A and yJN009-1D in YNB 50 mm DHA). Cells were washed in ice-cold 20 mm MES buffer, pH 6.5, and disrupted by vortexing with acid-washed glass beads, with the exception of cells grown on 50 mm DHA that were washed three times in sterile MilliQ water prior to the normal washing procedure. DAK activity was recorded as amount of NADH oxidized/unit of time in a coupled reaction with excess of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. During DAK activity measurements, the addition of 4 mm DHA started the reaction. Protein content of extracts was determined using a slightly modified Lowry assay (product number P5656; Sigma) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. During measurement of kinetic parameters with respect to DHA, measurements were performed at six different concentrations of DHA between 40 and 800 μm and at a constant concentration of 10 mm ATP. Measurements with respect to ATP were performed at six different ATP concentrations in the range 0.1–5 mmand at a constant DHA concentration of 4 mm. Reactions were started with the addition of ATP, when the kinetic parameters of DAK with respect to ATP were determined, and with DHA, when parameters with respect to DHA were determined. Gel filtration experiments were performed using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C. Extracts were kept on ice when possible. Cells of strain yMM006 from 500 ml of exponential phase culture (OD610 0.35) grown in defined minimal medium supplemented with 2% glucose were harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of MES/(NH4)2SO4 buffer (0.1m (NH4)2SO4, 20 mm MES, pH 6.5) supplied with Complete Mini protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were broken through vortexing in the presence of glass beads (1.5 g; 0.5-mm diameter) four times for 30 s each with intermittent placing on ice for at least 30 s. Extracts were then cleared through centrifugation at 18,000 ×g using a SS-34 rotor (Sorvall), and 500 μl of the supernatant (about 5 mg of protein) was loaded onto a 120-ml Superdex 200 column equilibrated with 2 column volumes of MES/(NH4)2SO4 buffer. The column was eluted with the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. Protein concentration in the eluate was continuously monitored as absorbance at 280 nm, and DAK activity of the fractions was measured throughout the whole range. A size standard curve was generated using the high and low molecular weight gel filtration calibration kit (product numbers 17-0441-01 and 17-0442-01;Amersham Biosciences) containing the following proteins: catalase (232 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) in addition to blue dextran 2000 reconstituted in elution buffer. The elution of blue dextran 2000 was set to equal the void volume (V 0). The elution volumes were all converted to partition coefficient (K av) values ((elution volume − void volume)/(total bed volume − void volume)). The K av obtained for Dak1p was fit to the standard curve made by plotting M ragainst K av. Strictly anoxic growth conditions were imposed by incubating cells in defined minimal medium, as described above, with the addition of 1 ml/liter of a stock solution of ergosterol/Tween 80 (10 g/liter ergosterol and 420 g/liter Tween 80 in 99.5% ethanol) and under constant nitrogen flushing using a system described elsewhere (23Valadi H. Månsson Å. Adler L. Blomberg A. Gustafsson L. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 47: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In short, 100-ml shake flasks were connected to air-tight rubber stoppers and hoses and put under constant flushing with humidified nitrogen gas. To verify anaerobicity, a culture of thegpd1Δgpd2Δ double deletion mutant was incubated along with the other cultures. Tests for methylglyoxal sensitivity, DHA sensitivity in salt containing medium, formaldehyde sensitivity, and DHA sensitivity of mutants were all performed in a 100-well microcultivation system (24Warringer J. Blomberg A. Yeast. 2003; 20: 53-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Cultures were inoculated with overnight cultures grown in 5 ml of medium in plastic tubes (Falcon), and experiments were performed in glucose minimal medium, supplemented with methylglyoxal (Sigma), DHA, NaCl, or formaldehyde (Merck) to the specified amounts (see above), in a Bioscreen C, which is a combined incubator/shaker/spectrophotometer (Labsystems Oy). In short, cells were grown at 30 °C in a culture volume of 350 μl and a shaking regime of 60 s of high intensity shaking followed by 60 s without shaking. For methylglyoxal sensitivity tests, the growth of the different strains was recorded every 20 min during a 24-h period. When DHA sensitivity of mutants was tested, cultures were monitored for growth every 30 min for 72 h. During combined DHA and salt, as well as formaldehyde, sensitivity tests, culture growth was recorded every 40 min for 96 h. Recorded values were subsequently exported to Excel, where OD data were corrected for the nonlinearity of the OD measurements at higher cell densities, and from these corrected OD values the length of the lag phase, the generation time, and the stationary OD increment were calculated. Samples from exponential phase cultures (OD610 = 0.35) were analyzed for glycerol using a commercial kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described before (5Ansell R. Granath K. Hohmann S. Thevelein J. Adler L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2179-2187Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Intracellular glycerol was calculated by subtracting extracellular glycerol, measured on filtered samples (0.2 μm), from total glycerol values. DHA uptake measurements were performed essentially as described earlier for glycerol uptake measurements (25Tamas M.J. Luyten K. Sutherland F.C. Hernandez A. Albertyn J. Valadi H., Li, H. Prior B.A. Kilian S.G. Ramos J. Gustafsson L. Thevelein J.M. Hohmann S. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1087-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). 500 ml of exponential phase cultures (OD610 of 0.35), with either glucose, galactose, or ethanol as carbon and energy source, were harvested and resuspended in 10 mm MES, pH 6.0, to a density of ∼70 mg dry weight/ml. Dry weight was determined by filtering and drying (3 days at 80 °C) of 100 μl of cell suspension (duplicate samples). 14C-Labeled DHA (55 mCi/mmol; American Radiolabelled Chemicals) was added to a concentration of 85 μm and mixed with unlabelled DHA solutions to yield DHA concentrations in the range of 0.18–200 mm. Cell suspensions (10 μl) were exposed to the indicated DHA concentrations in a total volume of 50 μl for 0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 s. Uptake was found to be linear with time during the period measured (the mean correlation coefficient of the linear regression for all uptake experiments was calculated to be 0.966 ± 0.092 (n = 27)). The rate of DHA uptake was taken as the slope of the linear curve fitted through data at the five different time points. In order to experimentally link the putative DAK-encoding genes, YML070W (DAK1) and YFL053W(DAK2), to the salt stress-induced DAK enzymatic activity inS. cerevisiae (8Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), deletion mutants were constructed, either in single or in combination (Table I). Gene deletions were produced in diploids that were subsequently sporulated to obtain the corresponding haploid with the gene(s) deleted. It was clear that none of the gene deletions, either in single or double knock-out strains, resulted in lethality; nor could we in the mutants observe any sporulation defect (data not shown). In addition, DAK1 and DAK2overexpression strains were constructed, carrying a multicopy plasmid with the YML070W/DAK1 or theYFL053W/DAK2 gene expressed behind the strong and constitutive TPI1 promoter (Table I). The wild type strain YJN009-1A (a W303–1A isogenic derivative) displayed an easily detectable DHA kinase activity of 4.3 units/mg protein under basal growth conditions (TableII). This is an activity value in line with earlier reported data on another wild type laboratory strain, SKQ2n, which during nonsaline growth exhibits a DAK activity of 7.6 units/mg protein (8Norbeck J. Blomberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5544-5554Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The mutant where theYML070W/DAK1 gene was deleted (designateddak1Δ), exhibited no detectable DAK activity in either control or salt stress medium even after the addition of increased amount of cell extract to the assay (we estimated that the DAK activity of this mutant strain was at least 1000-fold lower than in the wild type). Thus, the YFL053W/DAK2-encoded product does not contribute significantly to the overall DAK activity, at least under these growth conditions. This was further supported by the fact that deletion of the YFL053W/DAK2 resulted in no detectable difference in the recorded DAK activity compared with the wild type (data not shown).Table IIDihydroxyacetone kinase activity in cell extract from different strainsStrainYNB 2% glucoseYNB 50 mm DHAunits/mg proteinWild type4.3 ± 0.79 (n = 3)7.5 ± 0.011 (n = 2)dak1Δdak2ΔND2-aND, not detectable.NDpTPI1-DAK11040 ± 360 (n = 3)117 ± 24 (n = 2)pTPI1-DAK2ND140 ± 20 (n = 3)For further details about the strains see information in Table I.2-a ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab For further details about the strains see information in Table I. Overexpression of the YML070W/DAK1 gene product in a DAK double deletion strain resulted in a roughly 250-fold enhanced specific DAK activity compared with the wild type to 1040 units/mg protein during growth in basal medium (Table II). On the contrary, the overexpression construct carrying theYFL053W/DAK2 gene did not, during growth on glucose, display any detectable DAK activity. We conclude that the open reading frame YML070W/DAK1 encodes a dihydroxyacetone kinase in S. cerevisiae. The kinetic properties of Dak1p were initially tested on crude extracts obtained from the wild type yJN009-1A grown in 0.7 m NaCl medium. Proper kinetic measurements were technically problematic at low substrate concentrations, because the obtained measurements were generally low and close to the background. However, it was estimated that the Dak1pK m for DHA was roughly in the range 10–20 μm. To obtain more reliable experimental data, extracts obtained from the strain overproducing the Dak1 protein were used for subsequent analysis of kinetic properties. As can be seen in Fig. 1 A, the K mfor DHA (at a fixed concentration of ATP of 10 mm) was determined to 22 μm. This value of K mfor DHA was thus in agreement with the K m estimate using crude extracts obtained from the wild type strain. TheK m value determined for ATP (at a fixed concentration of DHA of 4 mm) was 0.49 mm (Fig. 1 B)"

In vitro, this adduct has previously been shown to pose a severe block to translesion synthesis by a number of polymerases (pol). Here we show that both yeast and human pol η can incorporate a C opposite γ-HOPdG at ∼190- and ∼100-fold lower efficiency relative to the control deoxyguanosine and extend from a C paired with the adduct at ∼8- and ∼19-fold lower efficiency. Although DNA synthesis past γ-HOPdG by yeast pol η was relatively accurate, the human enzyme misincorporated nucleotides opposite the lesion with frequencies of ∼10−1 to 10−2. Because γ-HOPdG can adopt both ring closed and ring opened conformations, comparative replicative bypass studies were also performed with two model adducts, propanodeoxyguanosine and reduced γ-HOPdG. For both yeast and human pol η, the ring open reduced γ-HOPdG adduct was less blocking than γ-HOPdG, whereas the ring closed propanodeoxyguanosine adduct was a very strong block. Replication of DNAs containing γ-HOPdG in wild type and xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells revealed a somewhat decreased mutation frequency in xeroderma pigmentosum variant cells. Collectively, the data suggest that pol η might potentially contribute to both error-free and mutagenic bypass of γ-HOPdG. γ-Hydroxy-1,N 2-propano-2′deoxyguanosine (γ-HOPdG) is a major deoxyguanosine adduct derived from acrolein, a known mutagen.

In organisms, acrolein is generated via a number of pathways, such as the oxidation of polyamines and lipid peroxidation (1Chung F.-L. Nath R.G. Nagao M. Nishikawa A. Zhou G.-D. Randerath K. Mutat.

Like many other bifunctional aldehydes, acrolein reacts with DNA bases to form several DNA adducts, among which the γ-hydroxy-1,N 2-propano-2′deoxyguanosine (γ-HOPdG)1 was identified as a major deoxyguanosine (dG) derivative (3Chung F.-L. Young R. Hecht S.S. Cancer Res. 1984; 44: 990-995PubMed Google Scholar, 4Exocyclic DNA Adducts in Mutagenesis and Carcinogenesis.in: Singer B. Bartsch H. IARC Scientific Publications No. 150. International Agency for Research on Cancer, Lyon, France1999: 1-15Google Scholar). Importantly, γ-HOPdG has been detected in DNA from mammalian tissues (5McDiarmid M.A. Iype P.T. Kolodner K. Jacobson-Kram D. Strickland P.T. Mutat. Res. 1991; 248: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 6Nath R.G. Chung F.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Perspect. 2001; 109: 219-224PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that this adduct is generated in vivo. The γ-HOPdG adduct is formed by conjugate addition of acrolein to N2 of dG to produceN 2-(3-oxopropyl)dG. Ring closure at N1 leads to the formation of the cyclic adduct (Fig. 1). In the nucleoside and presumably in single-stranded DNA, γ-HOPdG predominantly exists in the cyclic form, such that at physiological pH, the ring open species cannot be detected spectrophotometrically (8Nechev L.V. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of a reducing agent, the acyclic form can be trapped as theN 2-(3-hydroxypropyl) adduct (Fig. 1). Another dG derivative, 1,N 2-propanodeoxyguanosine (PdG) (Fig. 1), whose structure is similar to that of the ring closed γ-HOPdG, has been extensively exploited as a model compound for the γ-HOPdG and other exocyclic dG adducts in both structural and biological studies. NMR spectroscopy of the PdG-adducted oligodeoxynucleotides has revealed that when placed opposite dC, PdG adopts a syn orientation within the duplex and introduces a localized structural perturbation that is pH- and sequence-dependent (9Singh U.S. Moe J.G.

Specifically, PdG-induced base substitutions occurred at an overall frequency of 7.8 × 10−2 and 7.5 × 10−2/translesion synthesis in the COS-7 (14Moriya M. Zhang W. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and in the nucleotide excision repair-deficient human cells (16Yang I.-Y. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), respectively. In both strains, G to T transversions predominated. Recently, the structure of the γ-HOPdG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide was solved by NMR spectroscopy (17de los Santos C. Zaliznyak T. Johnson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9077-9082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These data have indicated that within the duplex, γ-HOPdG exists primarily in the ring open form. In such a conformation, the modified base participates in standard Watson-Crick base pairing by adopting a regular anti orientation around the glycosidic torsion angle, with the N 2-propyl chain in the minor groove pointing toward the solvent (17de los Santos C. Zaliznyak T. Johnson F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9077-9082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The structural differences between PdG and γ-HOPdG within the duplex have led to the hypothesis that the latter lesion would be less blocking for replication and less mutagenic than the former. Biological studies aimed to test the cytotoxic and mutagenic effects of acrolein-modified DNAs and of site-specific γ-HOPdG adduct have generated conflicting results. It is known that acrolein itself causes mutations in both bacterial (18Marnett L.J. Hurd H.K. Hollstein M.C. Levin D.E. Esterbauer H. Ames B.N. Mutat. Res. 1985; 148: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and mammalian (19Curren R.D. Yang L.L. Conklin P.M. Grafstrom R.C. Harris C.C. Mutat.

Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 3577-3581PubMed Google Scholar). When a DNA vector was treated with acrolein and propagated in human cells, the majority of mutations were single, tandem, and multiple base substitutions that predominantly occurred in G:C base pairs (21Kawanishi M. Matsuda T. Nakayama A. Takebe H. Matsui S. Yagi T. Mutat. Res. 1998; 417: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However in bacteria, γ-HOPdG, the major acrolein-derived dG adduct, is not a strong block for DNA synthesis nor a miscoding lesion (22Yang I.-Y. Hossain M. Miller H. Khullar S. Johnson F. Grollman A.

Chem. 2002; 277: 18257-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analyses of mutations caused by γ-HOPdG in wild type Escherichia coli and inpolB, dinB, and umuDC deficient strains revealed that in the absence of these “SOS” polymerases, the efficiency and accuracy of the translesion synthesis were not significantly affected (22Yang I.-Y.

In contrast to the prokaryotic data, γ-HOPdG caused mutations at an overall frequency of 7.4 × 10−2/translesion synthesis when a single-stranded, site-specifically modified vector was propagated in COS-7 cells (24Kanuri M. Minko I.G. Nechev L.V. Harris T.M. Harris C.M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18257-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Interestingly, both the frequencies and types of mutations were remarkably similar to those reported for the PdG adduct (14Moriya M. Zhang W. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11899-11903Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 16Yang I.-Y. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, γ-HOPdG was shown to be only marginally miscoding (≤1% base substitution) when double-stranded vector was utilized (16Yang I.-Y. Johnson F. Grollman A.P. Moriya M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In this investigation, a number of cell lines including HeLa, a nucleotide excision repair-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum group A, and polymerase η-deficient xeroderma pigmentosum variant were examined. Although replication across γ-HOPdG in vivo was predominantly error-free (from 93 to 100% of the translesional events), the adduct was shown to be a severe block and a miscoding lesion during in vitro DNA synthesis by a number of polymerases. Particularly, replication across γ-HOPdG by the Klenow exo− fragment of E. coli polymerase I was significantly inhibited and extremely error-prone (22Yang I.-Y. Hossain M. Miller H. Khullar S.

Harris C.M. Marnett L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9066-9070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). γ-HOPdG also strongly blocked DNA synthesis by two major eukaryotic polymerases, pol δ and pol ε (24Kanuri M.

In the presence of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, little bypass of the adduct by pol δ was achieved, and it appeared to be highly mutagenic (24Kanuri M. Minko I.G. Nechev L.V. Harris T.M.

We hypothesized therefore that in mammalian cells, specialized, translesion DNA synthesis polymerases (25Ohmori H. Friedberg E.C. Fuchs R.P. Goodman M.F. Hanaoka F. Hinkle D. Kunkel T.A.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of RAD30 confers moderate sensitivity to UV irradiation and leads to increased UV-induced mutagenesis (32McDonald J.P. Levine A.S. Woodgate R. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1557-1568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the human RAD30A gene cause the variant form of xeroderma pigmentosum (XPV), suggesting that predisposition of XPV individuals to sunlight-induced skin cancer is due to the lack of accurate translesion DNA synthesis across UV-induced DNA lesions (28Johnson R.E.

Yeast and human pol η also efficiently bypass a product of oxidative DNA damage, the 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine, and do so in a predominantly error-free manner (34Haracska L., Yu, S.-L. Johnson R.E.

In the present study, the ability of yeast and human pol η to perform translesion DNA synthesis across γ-HOPdG has been examined, and the efficiency and fidelity of synthesis have been tested using steady-state kinetic analyses. To further explore the bypass mechanism, comparative studies were also performed with two model DNA adducts: PdG, which mimics the cyclic form of γ-HOPdG, andN 2-(3-hydroxypropyl)dG, which is similar to γ-HOPdG in its ring open form. In addition, the mutagenic potential of γ-HOPdG was tested in vivo in both human fibroblasts and pol η-deficient XPV cells utilizing a site-specifically modified single-stranded pMS2 vector. T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase, andEcoRV were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). S1 nuclease and proteinase K were purchased from Invitrogen.

SV40-transformed cTAG derived from XP4BE cells and SV80 normal human fibroblasts were obtained from Dr. Marila Cordeiro-Stone (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). The E. coliDH10B cells used for amplification of transformed DNA isolated from mammalian cells were purchased from Invitrogen. 12-mer oligodeoxynucleotide modified with γ-HOPdG, 5′-GCTAGC(γ-HOPdG)AGTCC-3′, was kindly provided by Dr. T. M. Harris and Dr. C. M. Harris (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN), and it was prepared by a previously described procedure (8Nechev L.V. Harris C.M. Harris T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2000; 13: 421-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The 24-mer oligodeoxynucleotide, 5′-GCAGTATCGCGC(PdG)CGGCATGAGCT-3′, adducted with PdG was synthesized as described (41Marinelli E.R. Johnson F. Iden C.R. Yu P.L. Chem. Res.

Nondamaged 12- and 24-mer with a dG in place of γ-HOPdG or PdG, respectively, were purchased from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). All of the other oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized by the Molecular Biology Core Laboratory of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Toxicology Center at the University of Texas Medical Branch (Galveston, TX) and purified by electrophoresis through a 15% denaturing PAGE (in the presence of 7 m urea). Construction of site-specifically modified linear templates forin vitro replication assays was done according to the previously described procedure (24Kanuri M. Minko I.G. Nechev L.V. Harris T.M. Harris C.M. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18257-18265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Sequences of the resulting oligodeoxynucleotides were identical: 5′-GCTAGCGAGTCCGCGCCAAGCTTGGGCTGCAGCAGGTC-3′, where the underlined G is either γ-HOPdG or nonadducted dG and 5′-GCAGTATCGCGCGCGGCATGAGCTGCGCCAAGCTTGGGCTGCAGCAGGTC-3′, where the underlined G is either PdG or nonadducted dG. To obtain theN 2-(3-hydroxypropyl)dG-containing DNA substrate, 10 μl of 1 m NaBH4 dissolved in 1m Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) were added twice to 200 μl of the γ-HOPdG-adducted 38-mer oligodeoxynucleotide (1–2 μm). Each addition of the reducing agent was followed by incubation at room temperature for 4 h. DNA was then dialyzed against 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA overnight using Slide-A-Lyzer Dialysis Cassette (3,500 molecular weight cut off). To confirm the completeness of reduction, the polypeptide trapping technique was utilized (42Kurtz A.J. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7054-7064Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) modified by A. J. Kurtz for γ-HOPdG-containing DNAs. Briefly, probes of both γ-HOPdG- and reduced γ-HOPdG-adducted oligodeoxynucleotides (50 nm) were incubated with 50 mm lysine-tryptophan-lysine-lysine in the presence of 25 mm NaCNBH3 and 100 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) for 5 h. The reactions were terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 95% (v/v) formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue and heating at 90 °C for 2 min. Next, DNAs were resolved through a 15% denaturing PAGE and visualized with PhosphorImager Screen. Under these conditions, no trapping was detected in reactions with γ-HOPdG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide, whereas the γ-HOPdG-containing DNA was completely complexed with the polypeptide. Purifications of yeast pol η and human pol η were done as described in Refs. 27Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar and 31Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7447-7450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, respectively. The 21-mer oligodeoxynucleotides were used as primers for in vitro polymerase reactions. Their sequences were: 5′-CCTGCTGCAGCCCAAGCTTGG-3′, which is complementary to the 38-mer γ-HOPdG-containing template DNAs from positions −9 to −29 relative to the site of lesion (−9 primer) as well as complementary to the PdG-adducted 50-mer from positions −15 to −35 (−15 primer); 5′-AGCCCAAGCTTGGCGCGGACT-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGGCGCAGCTCATGCCG-3′, which are complementary from the position −1 to −21 to the γ-HOPdG-containing template and the PdG-containing template, respectively (−1 primers); and 5′-GCCCAAGCTTGGCGCGGACTC-3′ and 5′-GCTTGGCGCAGCTCATGCCGC-3′, which overlap the lesion site in modified templates (0 primers). Primer oligodeoxynucleotides were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP and purified using P-6 Bio-Spin columns supplied with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.4). The γ-32P-labeled primers were mixed with the oligodeoxynucleotide substrates at a molar ratio of 1:2 in the presence of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and cooled to room temperature overnight. Primer extension and single-nucleotide incorporation experiments with yeast pol η were carried out as described (27Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. Science. 1999; 283: 1001-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (694) Google Scholar) and with human pol η as in Ref. 31Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7447-7450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar. Briefly, the reaction mixture (10 μl) contained 5 nm primer annealed to a template, 25 mmTris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 100 μg/ml of bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μm of each of the four dNTPs (primer extension experiments), or 10 μmindividually (single-nucleotide incorporation experiments), and yeast or human pol η at the concentrations as indicated in the figure legends. The reactions were incubated at 22 °C and terminated by the addition of 4× excess of stop solution consisting of 95% (v/v) formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% (w/v) xylene cyanol, and 0.02% (w/v) bromphenol blue. The reaction products were resolved through a 20% denaturing PAGE and visualized by a PhosphorImager screen. Steady-state kinetic assays were carried out under the same conditions as the DNA polymerase assays except that 1 nm yeast or human pol η and 20 nm DNA substrates were used with various concentrations of one of the four nucleotides. The reactions were quenched after 5 min. Quantitative analyses were performed using a PhosphorImager screen and Image-Quant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Calculations of rates of nucleotide incorporation were done as described in Ref. 43Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar. The rates of nucleotide incorporation were graphed as a function of nucleotide concentration, and thek cat and K m parameters were obtained from the best fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The 12-mer oligodeoxynucleotides containing either γ-HOPdG or a nondamaged dG were phosphorylated at the 5′ end with ATP and inserted into single-stranded pMS2 shuttle vector as described earlier (24Kanuri M.

The two ligated samples were designated pMS2(dG) and pMS2(γ-HOPdG). Transfection of pMS2(dG) and pMS2(γ-HOPdG) into cTAG and SV80 cells, isolation of DNA, amplification in E. coli DH10B cells, and differential hybridization analysis were done as previously described (24Kanuri M.

Hybridization with the progeny plasmid DNA was performed using [γ-32P]ATP-labeled 18-mer oligodeoxynucleotide probes (5′-GATGCTAGCNAGTCCATC-3′, where N refers to A, T, G, or C). Whatman 541 filters containing hybridized colonies were exposed to X-Omat AR film overnight, and autoradiographs were developed to identify mutation frequency and types of mutations. Representative colonies were subjected to dideoxy sequencing (44Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A 20-mer primer (5′-CCATCTTGTTCAATCATGCG-3′) sequence around 100 nucleotides downstream of the adduct was used for sequencing the region containing the 12-mer oligodeoxynucleotide in progeny plasmid DNA. To examine whether yeast pol η was able to replicate past a γ-HOPdG adduct, running start primer extension experiments were performed (Fig. 2 A). A 21-mer primer was annealed to the template DNA so that it allowed the addition of 9 nucleotides before encountering the adduct (−9 primer). On the nondamaged DNA substrate, primers were efficiently extended by yeast pol η (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4). On the γ-HOPdG-containing substrate (Fig. 2 A, lanes 5–8), yeast pol η appeared to be capable of bypassing the lesion and forming full-length products. However, DNA synthesis was partially inhibited right before the DNA lesion and opposite from it. To understand better the importance of ring opening during replication, primer extension experiments were carried out using two model DNA substrates: the PdG adduct, which is an analogue of the ring closed form of the γ-HOPdG, and the reduced γ-HOPdG, which is similar to the ring open form of the natural adduct. In the case of the 50-mer PdG-containing substrate, 21-mer primer was positioned on the template so that the incorporation of 15 nucleotides was needed before reaching the lesion (−15 primer). Because both efficiency and accuracy of the DNA synthesis are known to be sequence-dependent (43Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 45Echols H. Goodman M.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 477-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), an additional nondamaged control 50-mer DNA template was utilized that had the same sequence as the PdG-adducted template. These data revealed that the PdG adduct was a much stronger block for replication by yeast pol η than γ-HOPdG. Under conditions that allowed an efficient replication of the nondamaged DNA template (Fig. 2 A,lanes 13–16), DNA synthesis on the PdG-adducted template was greatly inhibited one nucleotide before the lesion, and synthesis was completely aborted after incorporating a nucleotide opposite the lesion (Fig. 2 A, lanes 17–20). However, replication by yeast pol η beyond the PdG can be achieved but at much higher concentrations of enzyme (data not shown). With the reduced γ-HOPdG-adducted template (Fig. 2 A, lanes 9–12), the bypass efficiency by yeast pol η seemed to be comparable with that on the γ-HOPdG-adducted template. The specificity of nucleotide incorporation by yeast pol η opposite and beyond the lesions was also tested. To identify the nucleotide that is incorporated by this polymerase opposite the adducted base, single-nucleotide incorporation experiments were carried out using standing start DNA substrates in which 3′ terminus of the primer was located one nucleotide before the lesions (−1 primer"

Anionic phospholipids generally promote membrane binding of such proteins via electrostatics between the negatively charged lipid headgroups and clusters of basic groups on the proteins. In this study of one amphitropic protein, a cytidylyltransferase (CT) that regulates phosphatidylcholine synthesis, we found that substitution of lysines to glutamine along both interfacial strips of the membrane-binding amphipathic helix eliminated electrostatic binding. Unexpectedly, three glutamates also participate in the selectivity for anionic membrane surfaces. These glutamates become protonated in the low pH milieu at the surface of anionic, but not zwitterionic membranes, increasing protein positive charge and hydrophobicity. The binding and insertion into lipid vesicles of a synthetic peptide containing the three glutamates was pH-dependent with an apparent pKathat varied with anionic lipid content. Glutamate to glutamine substitution eliminated the pH dependence of the membrane interaction, and reduced anionic membrane selectivity of both the peptide and the whole CT enzyme examined in cells. Thus anionic lipids, working via surface-localized pH effects, can promote membrane binding by modifying protein charge and hydrophobicity, and this novel mechanism contributes to the membrane selectivity of CT in vivo.

CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylglycerol small unilamellar vesicles circular dichroism bovine serum albumin oleic acid green fluorescent protein wild type high performance liquid chromatography matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization Proteins that interact reversibly with cell membrane lipids usually have selectivity for negatively charged phospholipids (1Buckland A.G.

Biol. 1999; 16: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Some of these proteins show specificity for a particular anionic phospholipid. For example, protein kinase C binds preferentially to phosphatidylserine (3Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar); MARCKS (4Wang J. Arbuzova A. Hangyas-Mihalyne G. McLaughlin S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5013-5019Google Scholar) and proteins with PH domains (5Lemon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Biochem. J. 2000; 350: 1-18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) bind selectively to various phosphoinositides. However, many proteins exhibit non-selectivity with respect to the anionic phospholipid by a simple electrostatic interaction between clusters of basic residues on the protein and negatively charged lipid head groups (6Buser C.A. Kim J. McLaughlin S. Peitzsch R.M. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This binding affinity may be regulated by changes in membrane anionic lipid content, but more often by modification of the charge on the protein by a mechanism referred to as an “electrostatic switch” (7McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of a basic patch on such proteins as MARCKS (7McLaughlin S. Aderem A.

Alternatively, calcium binding to acidic residues in the C2 domain of protein kinase C and phospholipase A2 increases positive charge (10Murray D. Honig B Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 145-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Hisactophilin exhibits a variation on this theme, in which the protein charge may be modulated by cytosolic pH change (11Hanakam F. Gerisch G. Lotz S. Alt T. Seelig A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11036-11044Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this work, we provide an example in which increased anionic lipid composition modulates protein charge and hydrophobicity by influencing its protonation state and thereby increases membrane affinity. CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT)1 catalyzes a key rate-limiting step in PC synthesis and contributes to maintenance of cell membrane PC homeostasis (12Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). When the relative membrane PC content is altered, CT could respond by recognition of ensuing changes in the physical features of PC-deficient or PC-overloaded membranes, including changes in the negative surface charge density (13Cornell R.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, how CT responds to changes in surface charge has great bearing on the control of membrane phospholipid compositional homeostasis. There are three homologous mammalian CT isoforms, α, β1, and β2 (12Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Most of the biochemical characterization, including the work in this study, has been done with CTα. CTα activity is regulated by reversible membrane binding, which involves both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (12Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 13Cornell R.B. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1998; 26: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It binds poorly to pure PC membranes in vitro, and its binding affinity increases in proportion to the negative surface charge of the membrane (14Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5873-5880Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Arnold R.S. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9917-9924Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Importantly, its translocation to membranes in living cells also increases as a function of anionic lipid content (16Cornell R.B. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 919: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 17Wang Y. MacDonald J.I.S. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5512-5518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Weinhold P.A.

Membrane translocation is also accompanied by dephosphorylation of its C-terminal domain, but this event is subsequent to membrane binding (19Houweling M. Jamil H. Hatch G.M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7544-7551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the effects of phosphorylation status on membrane partitioning can be overcome by raising the anionic lipid content of the membrane (20Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17843-17849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Based onin situ imaging with fluorescent antibodies or with GFP-tagged CTα, the enzyme is predominantly nuclear in many cells (reviewed in Ref. 12Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and translocates to the nuclear envelope upon stimulation with exogenous fatty acids (12Cornell R.B.

Chem. 2001; 276: 49148-49155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reason for these cell-dependent differences in CTα localization is unresolved. A well characterized membrane-binding domain present in all CT isoforms (domain M) consists of a long amphipathic α-helix (Fig. 1 A and Refs. 25Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N. Tracey A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 26Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4327-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Domain M can be subdivided further into: (i) an N-terminal polybasic region (subdomain N, residues 237–255), (ii) a central, net negative region containing three 11-mer repeats (the VEEKS subdomain, residues 256–288), and (iii) a C-terminal aromatic-rich region terminating in a predicted bend (Fig. 1 A). Peptides corresponding to either the entire domain M, subdomain N, or the VEEKS subdomain bind selectively to anionic lipids (27Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The non-polar face of domain M helix creates a ∼120o wedge containing 18 aliphatic or aromatic side chains. The polar face is rich in acidic side chains. One of the interfacial strips is exclusively basic, and the other is a mixture of acidic and basic residues (Fig. 1, B andC). Our goal is to characterize the determinants in domain M responsible for CT selectivity toward anionic lipids. Using a VEEKS subdomain peptide, we previously showed that mutating to alanine the three serines interrupting the nonpolar face increases peptide hydrophobicity and reduces (but does not eliminate) the selectivity for anionic lipids (27Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The N-terminal portion of domain M is the most highly conserved region of domain M (28Friesen J.A. Liu M. Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1533: 86-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and has the highest concentration of positive charge. Here we have probed the contribution of these basic amino acids to the electrostatic interaction with anionic phospholipids by en bloc substitution of 5 or 8 interfacial Lys/Arg with glutamine (Fig. 1 B). We found that the membrane affinity was progressively reduced upon progressive elimination of peptide positive charge. The electrostatic component of the membrane binding was virtually eliminated upon removal of positive charge from both interfaces flanking the hydrophobic face of the peptide. CT binding to anionic lipid vesicles is enhanced as the pH is lowered from 7.4 to 6.3 (15Arnold R.S. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9917-9924Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). One hypothesis for this effect is that lowering the pH protonates the weakly acidic side chains in domain M, specifically the three interfacial glutamates, thereby neutralizing their negative charge and enhancing peptide hydrophobicity. We proposed (25Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N. Tracey A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) that the probability of protonation of these glutamates would be higher at the interface of an anionic membrane versus a zwitterionic membrane, because of the attraction of protons at the negative surface (Fig. 2). In this way, ironically, the positioning of three interfacial glutamic acid side chains could contribute to the selectivity for anionic phospholipids. To test this hypothesis we compared the binding characteristics of a wild-type VEEKS repeat peptide with a mutant analog, in which the interfacial glutamates were replaced with glutamine (Fig. 1 C). We found that the mutant peptide had reduced dependence on the anionic lipid content for binding, and that binding was pH-insensitive. These results imply that the interfacial glutamates contribute to the selectivity for anionic lipid. The same mutations were generated in the whole enzyme. The glutamine-substituted enzyme had higher affinity for membranes and, like the mutant peptide, was less dependent on high membrane surface charge for binding. Cell culture materials, restriction enzymes, and PCR primers were from Invitrogen. All other chemicals were reagent grade or better. All peptides were acetylated and aminated on their N and C termini. The syntheses of the 33-mer peptides corresponding to the wild-type subdomain N sequence (residues 236–268) and the VEEKS repeat sequence (residues 256–288) of rat CTα (29Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Lachance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1990; 87: 6029-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) were described previously (27Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). All other peptides were synthesized by Dr. Krystyna Piotrowska at the University of British Columbia Peptide Service Laboratory on an ABI model 431A synthesizer using Fmoc chemistry. The peptides were >98% pure after HPLC purification using a VYDAC C18 column. Their masses, determined by MALDI-mass spectroscopy, were within <2 daltons of their calculated mass, confirming the correct sequences. After lyophilization to remove the bound trifluoroacetic acid, the peptides were dissolved in water to a working stock concentration of 0.3–1 mm as confirmed by comparison to the fluorescence of a tryptophan standard. Egg PC and egg PG were from Northern Lipids (Vancouver, B.C.) or Avanti (Alabaster, Alabama). Stocks were quantitated (30Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and checked for purity by TLC as described (26Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4327-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Small unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared by sonication as described (27Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ionic strength of samples was varied by addition of 1–100 mm phosphate buffer stocks at pH 7.0 and addition of NaCl. Ionic strength was calculated using Equation 1, μ=½Σici(zi)2Equation 1 where c and z are the concentration and charge of each contributing ion, respectively. For pH titrations, phosphate buffers were prepared from pH 4.25 to 7.4 (50 mm) and pH 7.6 to 8.5 (40 mm). The ionic strength was equalized to 131 mm with NaCl. We accounted for the slight decrease in pH that occurred upon addition of 3 mm SUVs to samples for CD analysis (Fig. 6). SUVs of various compositions were incubated with peptide (10 μm) in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 20 °C. Vesicle-bound peptide was trapped by centrifugation through Microcon-100 filters (Amicon; Beverly, MA) at 3000 × g for 10–30 min until one-half to three-fourths of the original volume had filtered (27Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Samples of the filtrate were diluted 2-fold in phosphate and/or NaCl to equalize ionic strength, and adjusted to pH 10 with NaOH. The free peptide concentration was analyzed by derivatization with fluorescamine (0.4 mm, Sigma Chemical) (31Castell J.V. Cervera M. Marco R. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 379-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). For binding assays with the VEEKS-repeat peptides, samples of the filtrate were diluted 1:1 with methanol, and the peptide concentration was measured via tryptophan fluorescence (excitation, 280 nm; emission, 345 nm) to increase sensitivity by a factor of ∼5. For each analysis, standard curves were conducted with known concentrations of the appropriate peptide. A dimensionless partition coefficient (Kx) was calculated using samples where the percent-bound peptide ranged between 16 and 70% unless otherwise stated, using Equation 2, Kx=([P]b/[P]f)([H2O]/[L])Equation 2 where [P]b/[P]f = molar ratio of bound peptide/free peptide, and [H2O]/[L] = molar ratio of water (55.5m) to accessible lipid (0.6 × total [lipid]). SUVs of various compositions were incubated with peptide (3 μm) at 20 °C in phosphate buffer as described for at least 5 min prior to spectral acquisition. Tryptophan fluorescence spectra were acquired as described previously (27Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Tyrosine fluorescence of Pep-5KQ (15 μm) was monitored at 304 nm (excitation, 280 nm). The increase in peptide fluorescence at 304 nm in the presence of vesicles was normalized to F304 of peptide in buffer. All spectra were acquired at 20 °C on an SLM 4800C or PTI model QM-1 spectrofluorometer. Spectra were smoothed, and the contribution of the lipid was subtracted. To calculate Kx values from fluorescence measurements, the ratio of bound/total peptide was estimated from the fluorescence measurements by (F −Fo)/(F max −Fo), where F = fluorescence increase or blue shift of sample containing peptide + lipid;Fo = fluorescence value of lipid-free peptide;F max = fluorescence value at saturating lipid contents. CD spectra were acquired at 20 °C as described previously (27Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Peptides (30 μm) were mixed with lipid vesicles or trifluoroethanol for at least 5 min prior to spectral acquisition. Spectra were smoothed and the contribution of the buffer and/or lipid was subtracted. The CD values were converted to mean residue molar ellipticity (θ; deg cm2dmol−1), and the percent helix was estimated from θ222 nm as described (27Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To generate a mutant CTα containing glutamines at codons 257, 268, and 279, we designed the following mutagenic primers: CL1, 5′-cGGATCCaaATCGATAGATCTcatccagaagtggcaggagaagtCCCGGGagttcattggaagt-3′; CL2; 5′-cGGATCCAGATCTATCGATttctcctgcactttctgcacaaattctttcgacttttcctgcacatctttcacttt-3′. The mutagenic nucleotides are in bold and the engineered restriction sites, BamHI, BglII, ClaI, and SmaI (uppercase) created silent mutations. Two PCR reactions were performed using Pfu polymerase with wild-type rat CTα cDNA (32MacDonald J. Kent C. Prot. Express Purif. 1993; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) inserted into the SalI site of pBSKS (+) as a template. The CL1 mutagenic primer was paired with the vector reverse T7 primer, and the CL2 mutagenic primer was paired with the vector forward T3 primer to generate PCR products of 910 and 430 bp, respectively. These PCR products were cut with ClaIand SalI and inserted into the appropriate sites of pBSKS (+). The accuracy of the resulting constructs was confirmed by sequencing. The two PCR fragments were joined at the ClaI site to generate CT-3EQ. CT-3EQ was moved to the expression vector pAX142 (33Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using SalI. COS-1 cells were cultured and transfected with pAX-142 constructs as described (34Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that the seeding density was 1 × 106 cells/10-cm dish, and the cells were glycerol-shocked for 2.5 min following rather than preceding treatment with 100 μm chloroquine for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were transfected with 3 μg of pAX142-CTα-WT per 10-cm dish for 20 h and 10 μg of pAX142-CTα-3EQ for 60 h to achieve equivalent expression levels. To enrich cells with oleic acid they were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with media containing 1 mm sodium oleate (Sigma Chemical) and 0.5–10 mg ml−1 BSA (fatty acid free; Calbiochem) to achieve OA/BSA molar ratios of 133:6.6. The oleate was prepared as a 10× sonicated stock in phosphate-buffered saline and was co-sonicated with the BSA prior to addition to cells. At the highest OA:BSA ratio, the viability of the cells after 1 h was >90%. The transfected cells were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5 mm EDTA, and homogenized by sonication for 2 × 15 s at 4 °C in 0.4 ml 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mmdithiothreitol. The protein concentration of the homogenates was ∼5 mg ml−1 (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215575) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis and Western blotting using an antibody against the N-terminal 17 amino acids of CTα was as described (36Veitch D.V. Gilham D. Cornell R.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). After adding K2HPO4 to a final concentration of 0.2 m, the homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to generate a particulate and soluble fraction. The particulate fraction was resonicated in homogenization buffer/0.2 M K2HPO4 as above. Aliquots of both fractions were assayed for CT activity for 15 min under optimum conditions of substrates (15Arnold R.S. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9917-9924Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and lipid activator (200 μm egg PC/oleic acid (1:1)). The lipids in the particulate fractions were extracted (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42666) Google Scholar) and analyzed for phospholipid phosphorus content (30Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fatty acid, cholesterol, and triacylglycerol were separated by TLC on precharred silica H plates (Analtech) using hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:1). The TLC plates were scanned and densitometry was performed with Scion-Image software by reference to standards of oleic acid, cholesterol, and triolein, which were spotted on each TLC plate. Linear regression analysis of the plots of density versus nmol of standard lipid between 0–20 nmol gave r = 0.93–0.995. The mol fraction oleic acid was calculated as mol fatty acid/(mol PL + mol cholesterol + mol triacylglycerol + mol fatty acid). The contribution of the interfacial lysines and glutamates to membrane binding were analyzed using peptides in which the motifs are best represented. The role of the interfacial basic strip was investigated using peptides corresponding to amino acids 236–268 of rat CTα (29Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Lachance A. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and its structure in complex with SDS micelles has been solved (25Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N. Tracey A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It consists of a continuous α-helix between residues 242–268, linked via a ∼50o bend to a loosely coiled N terminus (25Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N. Tracey A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows the positioning of amino acids that were targeted for mutation. In the mutant peptide 5KQ, five basic amino acids on the right-hand interfacial zone were changed to glutamines: Arg-245, Lys-248, Lys-252, Lys-259, and Lys-266. These residues are generally conserved in animal CTs. Assuming protonation of His-241, the substitutions changed the net charge from +4 to −1. In the mutant peptide 8KQ, an additional three lysines on the opposite face, Lys-250, -254, and -261, were changed to glutamine, to generate a peptide with a net charge of −4. In the wild-type and 8KQ peptide F263 was substituted with tryptophan to facilitate monitoring of fluorescence. The three interfacial glutamates (Glu-257, Glu-268, Glu-279) were mutated to glutamine using the VEEKS subdomain peptide (residues 256–288; Fig. 1 C). The membrane binding behavior and secondary structure of the wild-type version of this peptide have been extensively studied (26Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4327-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 27Johnson J.E. Rao N.M. Hui S.W. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9509-9519Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The NMR-derived structure of a 22-mer peptide containing the second and third VEEKS repeats in complex with SDS micelles is a continuous α-helix (25Dunne S.J. Cornell R.B. Johnson J.E. Glover N. Tracey A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11975-11984Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The 3E to 3Q mutation changes the net charge from −2 to +1. This peptide also contains 6 interfacial basic residues that likely contribute to electrostatic binding. The substitutions did not alter the propensity of the peptides for helix formation, as determined by CD in 50% trifluoroethanol, a solvent that promotes internal H-bonding (data not shown). The helical contents estimated from the molar ellipticity at 222 nm were similar: 60% for Pep-8K, 73% for Pep-5KQ and 56% for Pep-8KQ; 69% for Pep-3E and 62% for Pep-3EQ. All peptides were predominantly random coil in water, except for Pep-8KQ, which adopted mostly β-structure in water (data not shown). The interactions of subdomain N peptides with SUVs were monitored by a direct vesicle-filtration binding assay, by CD, and by fluorescence changes. Thus, the binding event can be correlated with conformational changes and bilayer insertion processes. The progressively weakened response to PG/PC (1:1) lipid vesicles at 22 mm ionic strength upon removal of 5 or 8 interfacial lysines is evidenced by all three methods in the sets of parallel binding curves shown in Fig. 3. Weakened membrane binding (Fig. 3 A) is accompanied by reduced α-helix formation (Fig. 3 B) and by weaker insertion (Fig. 3 C). The bilayer insertion of wild-type peptide and Pep-8KQ was monitored via the blue shift in the fluorescence (330:350 nm) of a tryptophan located in the nonpolar face of the amphipathic helix. This change reached a plateau at a lipid/peptide ratio between 30–50 for the wild-type peptide. By contrast, no change in the fluorescence of Pep-8KQ was observed below a lipid/peptide ratio of 100. For Pep-5KQ, which was not engineered with a tryptophan, we monitored an increase in fluorescence at 304 nm, indicative of the movement of Tyr-240, the lone fluorophore in this peptide, into a more hydrophobic environment. A lipid/peptide ratio of ≥100 was required for maximum change of the F304for Pep-5KQ. These data suggest that both strips of interfacial lysines contribute to peptide binding. In addition they provide the first evidence for membrane insertion of the lone aromatic residue in the bend at the N terminus of domain M. We next probed the electrostatic nature of the interaction of WT, 5KQ, and 8KQ peptides by measuring their partitioning between aqueous and lipid phases as a function of mole percent anionic lipid and medium ionic strength. The effect of vesicle anionic lipid content is shown in Fig. 4 A. The binding of the peptides to pure PC vesicles was too weak to obtain a reliable estimate of their molar partition coefficients, Kx(sensitivity limit of the assay was Kx ≈ 1 × 104). The Kx of the wild-type peptide increased at least 2 orders of magnitude when the mol% PG was increased from 10 to 100% (Fig. 4 A). The response to increasing anionic lipid content was progressively muted upon substitution of the 5 or 8 lysines. This is in keeping with an elimination of the electrostatic component of the binding. The effect of ionic strength is shown in Fig. 4 B. Using 50% PG vesicles, the Kx for the wild-type peptide was reduced ∼50-fold as the ionic strength was raised from 11 mm to 0.75 m. At the lowest ionic strength, su"

Securins play a critical role in regulating the separation of sister chromatids during mitosis. They prevent premature chromosome separation through inhibition of separase activity by forming tight securin/separase complexes. At anaphase securins are degraded, releasing separases, which facilitate the dissociation of sister chromatids by cleaving the cohesin complex (5Nasmyth K. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 673-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). Deletion of securins has been found to cause abnormal chromosome segregation in fission yeast and human (6Jallepalli P.V.

Interestingly, the budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae lacking Pds1 fails to arrest when it is treated with ionizing radiation (8Cohen-Fix O. Koshland D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, ionizing radiation induces Pds1 phosphorylation at multiple locations, and this phosphorylation is thought to stabilize Pds1 and is essential for mitotic arrest (10Wang H. Liu D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1361-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 11Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H., Hu, F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These data indicate that Pds1 is involved in DNA damage checkpoints in budding yeast; however, it is unknown whether its functional homologue, vSecurin, participates in cellular responses to DNA damage in human. DNA damage checkpoints are mechanisms that arrest the cell cycle and repair the damaged DNA by regulating expression of relevant genes (12Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar). They are critical in maintaining genomic stability, which is vital to the health and survival of the cell. Genetic instability is believed to be an essential factor in the evolution of cancer in humans (13Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1998; 396: 643-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (3405) Google Scholar). One of the most important proteins controlling cellular responses to DNA damage in mammals is the tumor suppressor p53 (14Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 15Wahl G.M. Carr A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: E277-E286Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). By regulating expression of its downstream targets, p53 induces cell cycle arrest, promotes apoptosis, and facilitates DNA repair (14Lakin N.D. Jackson S.P. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7644-7655Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 16el-Deiry W.S. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1998; 8: 345-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). To investigate whether vSecurin plays a role in the cellular response to DNA damage as its homologue Pds1 does in yeast, we examined its expression in several human cancer cell lines after treatment with the chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicin (Dox)1 and bleomycin (Blm), both of which induce strand breaks in DNA (17Gewirtz D.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 727-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar, 18Povirk L.F. Mutat. Res. 1996; 355: 71-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Although the treated cells were mainly arrested at G2 phase, we found that the securin protein levels were dramatically reduced by Dox and Blm treatment. This drug-induced suppression of securin was strictly dependent on the presence of functional p53. Further studies on the human securin promoter revealed that activation of p53 by DNA damage reduced DNA binding of the transcription factor NF-Y to this promoter, resulting in repression of transcription. Our data clearly indicate that securin is a downstream target of p53 and suggest that suppression of securin plays an important role in cellular response to DNA damage. The wild-type p53 (pCMVp53wt) and dominant negative mutant p53 (pCMVp53mt135) expression vectors were obtained from Clontech Laboratories (Palo Alto, CA). A DNA fragment encoding the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was fused to the 5′-end of the p53mt135 coding region using PCR to generate an HA-tagged p53mt135 expression construct, pCMVHAp53mt135. The control plasmid pCMVβ expressing β-galactosidase was obtained from Clontech. A murine p19ARF expression construct (pcDNAp19ARF) was kindly provided by R. A. DePinho. For p-710Luc, a DNA fragment containing the human securin promoter region from −710 to +45 was isolated from p(−711/+201)-Luc 2K. R. Mehta, Y. Zhou, S. R. Johnson, M. Katai, X. Li, and X. Zhang, manuscript in preparation. and subsequently subcloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The site-specific mutations in Sp1-binding sites and CCAAT boxes were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. For each site-specific mutation, a pair of primers was designed to carry the desired mismatched nucleotides according to the promoter sequences (see below), and the reverse primer was phosphorylated at its 5′-end. PCR was performed with p-710Luc as the template using a Takara LA Taq TM Polymerase kit (Panvera, Madison, WI) under the condition of 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 8 min for a total of 21 cycles. The PCR products were polished withPfu DNA polymerase (Promega), treated with DpnI, purified by agarose gel electrophoresis, and self-ligated. The authenticity of the generated plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The promoters with desired mutations were then subcloned into pGL3-basic. The PCR primers are as follows (the underlined nucleotides were mismatched): CTGGCTGCTTAGGTCCTTTC (forward), pGGCTCCGATCCCAAAAGCTCTTTCTTGC (reverse) for pSp1–1mt; ACATCCACGGCCCCGCCTCCTG (forward), pGGTCACCAAGTAGAACCAATGG (reverse) for pSp1–2mt; ATCCTCCTGGGCGGAAGAGCCAATAGGGCC (forward), pGGGCCGTGGGCGTGGTCACCAAGTAGAACC (reverse) for pSp1–3mt; GGAAGAGCCAATTGGGCCGCGAGTTG (forward), pATCCAGGAGGCGGGGCCGTGGGCGTGGTCACC (reverse) for pSp1–4mt;AGGTTGTTTCCCCTATTTCTTC (forward), pAGGTTGGGTCTAAAGAATACG (reverse) for pCAT-1mt;GGGTTCTACTTGGTGACCAC (forward), pGGGAAAGGACCTAAGCAGCCAG (reverse) for pCAT-2mt; ACGTGGGCCGCGAGTTGTGGT (forward), pGGCTCTTCCGCCCAGGAGG (reverse) for pCAT-3mt. For pSp1–23mt with mutation of Sp1–2 and Sp1–3, a PCR was performed using primersATCCTCCTGGGCGGAAGAGCCAATAGGGCC (forward) and pGGTCACCAAGTAGAACCAATGG (reverse); For pSp1–123mt, a PCR was done using the primers for pSp1–23mt and pSp1–1mt as the template; For pSp1-Allmt, a PCR was performed using forward primer for pSp1–4mt, reverse primer for pSp1–23mt, and pSp1–1mt as the template; For pSp1-All-CAT-3mt, a PCR was performed using primersCGTGGGCCGCGAGTTGTGGT (forward) and pTGGCTCTGTCACCAAGTAGAACC (reverse) with pSp1-Allmt as the template. HCT116, U2OS, Saos2, and DLD-1 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA) and maintained according to the ATCC instructions. For transfection, U2OS and HCT116 were seeded into 12-well tissue culture plates and transfected usingTransIT-LT1 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instruction (Panvera). For each well, a total of 1 μg of plasmid DNA containing 0.2 μg of promoter construct, 0.2 μg of pCMVβ, and the others as indicated, plus 3 μl ofTransIT-LT1 reagent were used. Twenty hours after transfection, the cells were treated with doxorubicin (0.1 μm for U2OS and 0.5 μm for HCT116) or bleomycin (50 microunits/ml for both cell lines) for an additional 24 h and lysed for 30 min at 4 °C with 200 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Trizma (Tris base) phosphate, 2 mm trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N′N′-tetraacetic acid, 1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol). 10 μl of cell lysate was used for luciferase assay with 150 μl of assay buffer (25 mm Gly-Gly, pH 7.8, 4 mm EGTA, 15 mm Mg2SO4, 2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol in 15 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8) and 45 μl of luciferin using a luminometer. Another 10 μl of the lysate was used to measure β-galactosidase activity. The luciferase activity was finally normalized against the β-galactosidase activity from the same well. Cells were grown in 100-mm tissue culture dishes with or without treatment of Dox (0.2 μm for U2OS, 0.5 μm for HCT116, 0.1 μm for Saos2, and 0.25 μm for DLD-1) or Blm (50 microunits/ml for U2OS and HCT116, 25 microunits/ml for Saos2 and DLD-1). Twenty-hours later, nocodazole (Noc) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 μg/ml for HCT116, Saos2, and DLD1 and 0.1 μg/ml for U2OS as indicated. After incubation for an additional 16–18 h, cells in one set of the dishes were lysed with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for total RNA isolation according to the manufacturer's instruction. The cells in another set were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer for total protein isolation as previously described (19Zhou Y. Sun H. Danila D.C. Johnson S.R. Sigai D.P. Zhang X. Klibanski A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For detection of securin RNA transcript, Northern blotting was performed as previously described (20Zhang X. Horwitz G.A. Prezant T.R. Valentini A. Nakashima M. Bronstein M.D. Melmed S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 156-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). For detection of securin protein, the whole cell lysate was resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with a rabbit anti-human securin antibody (2.5 μg/ml) (catalogue No. 34-1500, Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA) and subsequently detected using the ECL Plus system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ). For detection of β-actin protein, Western blotting was performed exactly as previously described (19Zhou Y. Sun H. Danila D.C. Johnson S.R. Sigai D.P. Zhang X. Klibanski A. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 2066-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For detection of p53, the mouse monoclonal antibody Do-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used to probe the membrane. To determine expression of transiently transfected wt and mutant p53, cells were similarly transfected as described above and lysed with 200 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The 5 μg of total protein was then resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE. After transfer, the membrane was probed with Do-1 antibody for wt p53 and HA.11 (Covance, Richmond, CA) for HA-p53mt135. Nuclear extracts were prepared using the Nuclear Extract Kit from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). A double-stranded synthetic DNA oligomer containing the CCAAT boxes encompassing the initiation site of the human securin promoter (−17 to +13) was labeled with [γ-33P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear extract (4 μg) was preincubated on ice for 30 min with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with or without unlabeled competitor DNA, in 1× binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, and 10% glycerol with freshly added 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 0.25 mm dithiothreitol). The end-labeled probe (0.01 pmol, ∼30,000 cpm) was added into the mix and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. For the supershift assay with antibody, 2 μg of each antibody specific for NF-YA, NF-YC (H0209 and C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), NF-YB (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA), NF-I (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included in the preincubation mixture and the preincubation time was extended to 1 h on ice. For p53/NF-Y interaction, nuclear extract (2 μg) was preincubated with 2 μg of the purified recombinant p53 (BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) or bovine serum album (BSA) for 2 h on ice before the labeled probe was added. DNA·protein complexes were resolved on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris-glycine buffer at 10 mA at 4 °C. The gel was then dried and exposed to Kodak BioMax film. To quantify the protein·DNA complex, the radiation emission from the dried gel was recorded with a Storm PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences). To study the regulation of securin in response to DNA damage, we treated the human osteosarcoma cell line U2OS and the human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, both containing functional p53, with Dox and Blm. The treated cells were arrested at both G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle, with most cells arrested at G2 (Fig. 1 A), indicating that these cells contain functional cell cycle checkpoints. It has been reported that human securin expression is cell cycle-dependent. Its level is low in G1 phase, increases as cells enter S, and peaks in G2/M (21Ramos-Morales F. Dominguez A. Romero F. Luna R. Multon M.C. Pintor-Toro J.A. Tortolero M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In U2OS and HCT116, the securin protein was readily detectable in the untreated cycling cells by Western blotting (Fig. 1 B). As a control, we treated cells with the anti-microtubule drug nocodazole and found the majority of cells were arrested at M phase (Fig. 1 A and data not shown). In agreement with the previous findings (21Ramos-Morales F. Dominguez A. Romero F. Luna R. Multon M.C. Pintor-Toro J.A. Tortolero M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), a strong band with a higher apparent molecular mass than that in the untreated cycling cells was observed in cells treated with nocodazole (Fig. 1 B). This band is presumably the phosphorylated form of the securin protein (21Ramos-Morales F. Dominguez A. Romero F. Luna R. Multon M.C. Pintor-Toro J.A. Tortolero M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the securin level was significantly lower in the Dox- and Blm-treated U2OS and HCT116 cells, despite that the majority of the treated cells were arrested at G2 (Fig. 1 B), indicating that securin expression was suppressed in cells treated with DNA-damaging drugs. Because p53 plays a critical role in regulating cellular response to DNA damages, we next examined securin expression in p53-deficient human osteosarcoma Saos2 and colorectal cancer DLD-1 cells. When these cells were treated with Dox and Blm, only G2 arrest was observed (Fig. 1 C), consistent with the previous finding that p53 is required for DNA damage-induced G1 arrest (22Bunz F. Hwang P.M. Torrance C. Waldman T. Zhang Y. Dillehay L. Williams J. Lengauer C. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no securin suppression was observed in the drug-treated Saos2 and DLD-1 cells. Instead, a higher level of securin protein was found in the drug-treated cells compared with the untreated cycling cells (Fig. 1 D), indicating that the DNA damage-induced suppression of securin is p53-dependent. We next examined the securin RNA transcripts in cells treated with Dox and Blm. The mRNA was readily detected in all untreated cells (Fig. 2, A–C). However, the mRNA levels were profoundly diminished in U2OS and HCT116 cells treated with drugs (Fig. 2, A and B). In contrast, Dox and Blm treatment did not change the mRNA level in p53-deficient DLD-1 cells (Fig. 2 C). These data indicate that the DNA damage-induced decrease in securin protein is, at least in part, attributed to the transcriptional repression of the securin gene, and requires the presence of a functional p53. To investigate how p53 was involved in the DNA damage-induced suppression of securin, we analyzed the activity of the human securin promoter during DNA damage. A 4-kb DNA fragment containing the human securin promoter has been cloned in our laboratory. Deletion mutagenesis studies reveal that the majority of promoter activity is retained within the region from nucleotide position −710 to +201, which contains several Sp1 sites and CCAAT boxes.2 Further studies showed that DNA sequence from +46 to +210 was not required for the promoter activity (data not shown). Therefore, we considered the reporter plasmid p-710Luc, containing the 5′-flanking sequence from −710 to +45, as the wild-type promoter construct. When p-710Luc was transiently transfected into p53-proficient U2OS and HCT116 cells, treatment with either Dox or Blm significantly suppressed luciferase expression from this construct (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, no significant drug-induced suppression of the luciferase activity was observed in p53-deficient Saos2 and DLD-1 cells (Fig. 3 A). These data indicate that the p-710Luc responds to DNA damage agents in a similar way as the endogenous securin gene does. In agreement with the previous findings that DNA-damaging agents induce p53 accumulation (23Nelson W.G. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar), p53 levels were significantly elevated in both U2OS and HCT116 cells after treated with Dox and Blm (Data not shown). Considering the fact that Dox and Blm only reduced securin expression in p53-proficient cells, but not in p53-deficeint cells (Fig. 1), we reasoned that transcriptional repression of the securin promoter by DNA-damaging agents may be attributed to the accumulation of p53. To test this possibility, we examined the effects of p19ARF on luciferase expression from p-710Luc in U2OS and Saos2 cells. The wild-type (wt) p53 has a very short half-life due to its rapid degradation mediated by Mdm2 (24Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3750) Google Scholar, 25Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar). Expression of p19ARFblocks Mdm2 function, thereby inducing p53 accumulation (26Honda R. Yasuda H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 27Weber J.D. Taylor L.J. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Bar-Sagi D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar). In p53-proficient U2OS cells, co-transfection of a p19ARFexpression vector, pcDNAp19ARF, significantly suppressed luciferase expression from p-710Luc in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, transfection of pcDNAp19ARF had no effect on p-710Luc in p53-deficient Saos2 cells (Fig. 3 B), suggesting that activation of p53 is required for suppressing transcriptional activation of the securin promoter. We next tested whether the direct introduction of wt p53 would suppress securin promoter activity. The promoter construct p-710Luc was co-transfected with wt p53 or mutant p53 (p53mt135) expression constructs (pCMVp53wtand pCMVHAp53mt135, respectively) into U2OS and Saos2 cells. p53mt135 is a dominant negative mutant containing a single amino acid mutation, changing Cys-135 to Tyr, within its DNA binding domain (28Scheffner M. Takahashi T. Huibregtse J.M. Minna J.D. Howley P.M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5100-5105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the exogenous wt p53 suppressed luciferase expression in both cell lines, whereas expression of the mutant p53 failed to do so (Fig. 3 C), indicating that p53 is directly involved in repression of the securin promoter. To further confirm that suppression of the securin promoter during drug treatment was caused by p53 activation, we co-transfected p-710Luc with pCMVHAp53mt135 into U2OS cells and treated the cells with Dox. In the absence of p53mt135, the expression of luciferase was suppressed significantly by Dox. As the amount of pCMVHAp53mt135 increased, the degree in Dox suppression of the luciferase expression was gradually reduced (Fig. 3 D). When a sufficient amount of HAp53mt135 construct was included, the securin promoter activity was completely restored from the Dox suppression (Fig. 3 D). Because the p53mt135 alone did not activate p-710Luc in p53-deficient Saos2 cells (Fig. 3 C), restoration of the securin promoter activity from Dox suppression by p53mt135 is, therefore, due to the neutralization of the wt p53 activated by drug treatment. Taken together, these data convincingly demonstrate that DNA damage agent-induced suppression of securin expression is mediated by p53. The promoter sequence of securin between −710 and +45 consists of four Sp1-binding sites and four CCAAT boxes (Fig. 4 A). It has been shown that p53 inhibits transcription from the human telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter and the SV40 promoter by repression of Sp1 DNA binding (29Xu D. Wang Q. Gruber A.

Jackson P. Braithwaite A. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1299-1307PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, p53 suppresses expression of several genes through CCAAT sites on their promoters (31Agoff S.N. Hou J. Linzer D.I. Wu B. Science. 1993; 259: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 32Yun J. Chae H.D. Choy H.E. Chung J. Yoo H.S. Han M.H. Shin D.Y. J. Biol.

Therefore, it is possible that transcription factors interacting with Sp1 sites and CCAAT boxes are involved in the p53-mediated repression of the securin promoter. To explore this possibility, we mutated each of the Sp1-binding sites by changing the consensus sequence GGGCGG to GGATGG and tested how these mutations affected securin promoter activity in U2OS cells. Mutation of each Sp1-binding site individually did not significantly change activity of the promoter (pSp1–1mt, pSp1–2mt, pSp1–3mt, andpSp1–4mt in Fig. 4 B); however, when two or more Sp1 sites were mutated simultaneously, the securin promoter activity was dramatically decreased (pSp1–23mt,pSp1–123mt, and pSp1-Allmt in Fig. 4 B). Then, we tested the activities of these mutant promoter constructs in response to Dox treatment. Interestingly, Dox treatment suppressed the activity of all these constructs by ∼90%, very similar to the Dox-mediated suppression of the wt promoter construct p-710Luc (Fig. 4 B). These results indicate that the transcription factor Sp1 is essential for basal transcription activity of the securin promoter but not required in p53-mediated repression of the promoter. Next, we investigated whether CCAAT boxes are required for p53-mediated repression of the securin promoter. We mutated the CCAAT box by changing two or more nucleotides in the consensus core sequence of CCAAT (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mutated promoters were inserted into pGL3-Basic and tested for their transcription activities. It is necessary to point out that two CCAAT boxes are found overlapping the major transcription initiation site, the forward CCAAT-3 with the consensus sequence−10AAGAGCCAATTGGGCC+6 and the reversed CCAAT-4 with the sequence−8GAGCCAATTGGGCCGC+8 (Fig. 4 A). The CCAAT-3 and CCAAT-4 overlap each other; therefore, changing the two nucleotides shared by them in the core region mutates both CCAAT boxes. Thus, they were considered as one CCAAT box represented by CCAAT-3, and the promoter construct pCAT-3mt actually contained both mutated CCAAT-3 and CCAAT-4. As shown in Fig. 4 C, mutation of CCAAT-1 and -2 did not affect the securin promoter activity in U2OS cells (Fig. 4 C,pCAT-1mt and pCAT-2mt). However, mutation of CCAAT-3 reduced the promoter activity by ∼90% compared with that of the wt p-710Luc in U2OS cells (Fig. 4 C,pCAT-3mt). More interestingly, Dox treatment only slightly reduced activity of pCAT-3mt, while it significantly suppressed activity of pCAT-1mt and pCAT-2mt (Fig. 4 C). In addition, when the CCAAT-3 site was mutated in pSp1-Allmt, the generated pSp1-All-CAT-3mt had an activity similar to that of the promoter-less vector pGL3-Basic, which was much lower than that of pSp1-Allmt (Fig. 4 C). Furthermore, Dox treatment failed to suppress the promoter activity significantly from pSp1-All-CAT-3mt. These data clearly demonstrate that the CCAAT boxes overlapping the start site, represented as CCAAT-3, are required not only for transcription activation, but also for Dox-induced suppression of the securin promoter, whereas CCAAT-1 and -2 sites are dispensable for both activities. A similar result was also observed in HCT116 cells (data not shown). To further examine whether CCAAT-3 was critical for p53-mediated repression of the securin promoter, pCAT-3mt and pSp1-All-CAT-3mt were co-transfected with the pCMVp53wtexpression construct into U2OS cells. As expected, the wt p53 only slightly reduced luciferase expression from the promoters with CCAAT-3 mutations, whereas it significantly reduced expression of luciferase from their corresponding control promoters, p-710Luc and pSp1-Allmt (Fig. 4 D), demonstrating that CCAAT-3 is indeed the site through which p53 represses the securin promoter. To elucidate the mechanism by which p53 represses the securin promoter, we performed EMSA to identify the proteins binding to the CCAAT-3 site. A 30-bp oligomer, equivalent to the DNA sequence from position −17 to +13 of the human securin promoter containing CCAAT-3, was synthesized and named as CCAAT-3wt. As a control, a similar oligomer, named as CCAAT-3mt, was also generated to contain a mutated CCAAT-3 by changing sequences of CCAAT to CCACG(Fig. 5 A). CCAAT-3wt was labeled with 33P and incubated with nuclear extracts isolated from untreated U2OS cells or cells treated with Dox. The protein·DNA complexes were analyzed by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. A high molecular weight band was detected in the lane with nuclear extract from untreated U2OS cells (Fig. 5 B,lane 2). This band diminished when the nuclear extract was preincubated with excessive unlabeled CCAAT-3wt (Fig. 5 B,lanes 3 and 4), whereas preincubation with the same amount of the unlabeled CCAAT-3mt did not affect the band (Fig. 5 B, lanes 5 and 6). This indicates that the protein·DNA complex formed with this oligomer is CCAAT-3 sequence-specific. The complexes were also found with nuclear extracts from the Dox-treated cells (Fig. 5 B, lane 7); however, the intensity of the band was much lower than that with nuclear extract of the untreated cells (Fig. 5 B, comparinglanes 2 and 7). This suggests that Dox treatment reduces binding of the nuclear proteins to this site. Several transcription factors are capable of binding to DNA containing the CCAAT sequence, such as C/EBP, CBT/NF-1, and CBF/NF-Y (34Mantovani R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1135-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). A careful comparison between the consensus binding sequences of each CCAAT-binding protein with the sequences around the CCAAT-3 in the human securin promoter revealed that the sequence of this region matched the binding site for NF-Y (CCAAT) (34Mantovani R.

Based on phylogenetic analyses of a large set of H+-PPase sequences, it was suggested that K+-dependent and K+-independent enzymes form two independently evolving groups (17Pérez-Castiñeira J.R. Lopez-Marques R.L. Losada M. Serrano A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 496: 6-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, there were insufficient experimental data to precisely define the boundary between K+-dependent and independent H+-PPases. In a previous study, we noted that K+ dependence in H+-PPases correlates with a cysteine conservation pattern and suggested that the enzyme of the bacterium C. hydrogenoformans (Ch-PPase) is a K+-dependent H+-PPase that is closely related to K+-independent H+-PPases (16Belogurov G.A.

Here we report the high yield expression of fully functional Ch-PPase in Escherichia coli. The K+ dependence of this enzyme in conjunction with phylogenetic analyses permitted the inference of the K+ requirement of all available H+-PPase sequences. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments revealed that a single Lys residue that is specifically conserved in K+-independent H+-PPases abolishes K+ dependence when introduced in Ch-PPase. Tetramethylammonium (TMA) pyrophosphate was prepared by passing a solution of tetrasodium pyrophosphate through a column packed with Dowex 50W-X8 (Fluka, Switzerland) charged with TMA+. The concentration of the resulting TMA4PPi solution was determined by measuring Pi after boiling in 1 m HCl. All other reagents were from commercial sources.

The primers employed incorporated artificial NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The PCR product was digested with the above restriction enzymes and inserted into the corresponding restriction sites of the pET36b(+) multiple cloning site (Novagen). Mutagenesis was performed using an inverse PCR technique (19Stemmer W.P. Morris S.K. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 214-220PubMed Google Scholar). Ch-PPase encoding regions of the constructs were sequenced to confirm the presence of the required mutations and/or the absence of secondary substitutions.

IMV were prepared by modification of the procedure originally described by Rosen (21Rosen B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The cell pellet (6 g wet weight) was resuspended in 20 ml of buffer A (10 mm TMA-MOPS, pH 7.2, 0.15 msucrose, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 50 μm TMA-EGTA) supplemented with DNase I (20 μg/ml) and disrupted by a single passage through a French pressure cell at 14,000 p.s.i. (96.5 MegaPascals). Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by centrifugation at 38,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to an ultracentrifuge bottle, underlayered with 4 ml buffer A supplemented with 0.75 m sucrose, and centrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 3 h at 4 °C. The IMV suspension was withdrawn from the bottom of the bottle, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C until use. Protein concentrations in IMV suspensions were measured by the Bradford assay (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). IMV quantities were calculated in terms of protein content. Electrophoresis was performed with 12% gels containing 0.l% SDS (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar).

PPihydrolysis was assayed by continuously recording Piliberation with an automatic Pi analyzer (26Baykov A.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal.

The reactions were performed in an initial volume of 25 ml containing 100 mm TMA-MOPS, pH 7.2, 5.26 mmMgCl2, 163 μm TMA-PPi, 50 μm TMA-EGTA, and 0.25 mm TMA fluoride. KCl and TMA chloride were added to achieve the desired concentration of K+ and ionic strength of 0.22 m. The reaction was initiated by the addition of suitable aliquots (5–50 μl) of IMV suspension, and Pi liberation was monitored for 3 min. H+translocation across the IMV membrane was assayed fluorometrically at 25 °C in 2 ml buffer A supplemented with 0.15 mm sucrose, 50 mm MgCl2 and 100 mm KCl where indicated using 500 μg of IMV and 3 μm acridine orange as a ΔpH indicator (21Rosen B.P. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 125: 328-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Excitation and emission wavelengths were set at 495 and 540 nm, respectively. H+ translocation was initiated by the addition of 1 mm TMA-PPi and measured with a PerkinElmer MPF-2A fluorometer. The background concentrations of K+ and Na+ in assay media were below 5 μm and 20 μm, respectively, as determined by atomic absorption spectrometry (SpectrAA-300, Varian Techtron, Mulgrave, Australia). We initially expressed Ch-PPase in E. coli C43(DE3) using the method previously established for R. rubrum H+-PPase (16Belogurov G.A. Turkina M.V. Penttinen A. Huopalahti S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J.

SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses revealed an intense H+-PPase antiserum-reactive band in IMV prepared from C43(DE3) cells expressing Ch-PPase (Fig.1). Although the molecular mass of Ch-PPase calculated from the amino acid sequence is 71 kDa, the 60-kDa band was attributed to the full-length enzyme based on consistent reports of anomalous electrophoretic mobility for H+-PPases in SDS-PAGE (5Nyrén P. Nore B.F. Strid Å. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2883-2887Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Belogurov G.A. Turkina M.V. Penttinen A. Huopalahti S. Baykov A.A. Lahti R. J. Biol.

Because E. coli IMV lack endogenous pyrophosphatase, both PPi hydrolysis and PPi-energized H+ translocation by Ch-PPase can be assayed directly in these vesicles. Although the optimum temperature range for the growth of C. hydrogenoformans is 65–70 °C, the PPi hydrolysis by Ch-PPase was measured at 40 °C because at this temperature E. coli lipids still form a bilayer, the natural environment of membrane proteins. TMA fluoride (0.25 mm) was added to abolish any contribution of contaminating soluble E. coli pyrophosphatase. Under these conditions, the PPase activity in IMV containing Ch-PPase was negligible in K+-free (<5 μm K+) medium and increased as a simple hyperbolic function of K+concentration, consistent with the presence of a single K+binding site (Fig. 2, closed triangles). Heterologously expressed Ch-PPase was also active in PPi-energized H+ translocation into E. coli IMV as monitored by acridine orange fluorescence quenching. The latter assay was most reproducible at 25 °C where E. coli IMV are resistant to aggregation and their passive permeability to H+ is low. In agreement with data on PPi-hydrolyzing activity, PPi-energized H+-translocation was observed at 100 mmK+ (Fig. 3 A) but not in K+-free medium (Fig. 3 B). We conclude that heterologous expression of Ch-PPase results in fully functional and strictly K+-dependent enzyme.Figure 2Rate of PPi hydrolysis by IMV prepared from C43(DE3) cells expressing wild-type (▾), A460K (○), and A463T (▿) Ch-PPases as a function of K+concentration.

Chem. 2002; 277: 22209-22214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) have a common ancestor at node B. Any currently available H+-PPase sequence is the descendant of either the ancestor at node A or at node B and is hence classified as K+-dependent (from Cucurbita moschata to C. hydrogenoformans) or K+-independent (from Brucella melitensis toP. aerophilum), respectively. A comparison of the amino acid conservation patterns in K+-dependent and K+-independent H+-PPases revealed only two sequence positions where a residue conserved in one type is absent from the equivalent position in all the sequences from the other type. The Ala/Lys position is occupied by Ala in K+-dependent H+-PPase and Lys in K+-independent H+-PPase (Fig. 4, A/K column). Similarly, the Gly(Ala)/Thr position is occupied by Gly or Ala in K+-dependent H+-PPase and Thr in K+-independent H+-PPase (Fig. 4, G(A)/T column). These Ala/Lys and Gly(Ala)/Thr positions are located two amino acids apart in the conserved region at the interface between the predicted cytosolic loop and its adjoining transmembrane span and correspond to Ala460 and Ala463 of Ch-PPase. 2The Ala/Lys and Gly(Ala)/Thr positions also correspond to Lys465 and Thr468 of R. rubrum H+-PPase (GenBankTM accession number AAC38615) and Ala541 and Gly544 ofA. thaliana H+-PPase (GenBankTMaccession number A38230). To determine the effects of these residues on K+ requirement, we replaced Ala460 with Lys and Ala463 with Thr in Ch-PPase. Both A460K and A463T variants were expressed with the same yield as wild-type enzyme as judged from the intensities of the H+-PPase antiserum-reactive bands (Fig. 1). The A463T substitution resulted in strictly K+-dependent H+-PPase but with three times reduced affinity for K+ compared with wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2, open triangles). In contrast, both PPi-hydrolyzing (Fig. 2,open circles) and PPi-energized H+translocation (Fig. 3, A and B) activities of A460K variant were entirely K+-independent and half that of wild-type enzyme. The Lys in the Ala/Lys position was thus identified as the sole primary determinant of K+ independence in H+-PPases. The transition from K+-dependent to K+-independent H+-PPase may be viewed simply as the substitution of K+ with the NH3+ group of Lys. However, the residues forming the K+ binding site remain to be determined. Although Ala in the Ala/Lys position and Gly in the Gly(Ala)/Thr position are specifically conserved in K+-dependent H+-PPases, their direct participation in K+ binding is neither evident, nor is it likely that these residues are the only ones forming the K+ binding site. The current hypothesis is that the K+ binding site is located within the area occupied by the NH3+ group of conserved Lys. In summary, phylogenetic analyses and the primary sequence criterion of K+ requirement established in this work provide a means for accurate annotation of any H+-PPase sequence. With the number of available H+-PPase sequences doubling every year, this approach should be of great assistance in classification. We thank Dr. A. A. Baykov for critically reading the paper, Dr. J.

The overall P450 structure remains conserved despite the low sequence identity between the various P450s. The CYP175A1 structure lacks the large aromatic network found in the only other thermostable P450, CYP119, thought to contribute to thermal stability. The primary difference between CYP175A1 and its mesophile counterparts is the investment of charged residues into salt-link networks at the expense of single charge-charge interactions. Additional factors involved in the thermal stability increase are a decrease in the overall size, especially shortening of loops and connecting regions, and a decrease in the number of labile residues such as Asn, Gln, and Cys.

P450s are found throughout the biosphere and various genome projects have revealed a remarkable and unexpectedly large number of P450s in a variety of organisms. For example, humans have ∼180, Caenorhabditis elegans 81, Drosophila 90 (83 functional 7 pseudogenes) (1Tijet N. Helvig C. Feyereisen R. Gene ( Amst. ). 2001; 262: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and Arabidopsis 273 (drnelson.utmem.edu/CytochromeP450.html). Several bacteria also have P450s, but normally bacteria produce only one or at most a few P450s. Another surprising occurrence of a P450 was demonstrated in 1996 when the first P450 from a hyperthermophile, CYP119, was discovered (2Wright R.L. Harris K. Solow B. White R.H. Kennelly P.J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CYP119 was identified in the acidothermophilic archaeonSulfolobus solfataricus. This was not only the first thermostable P450 to be discovered but also the first demonstration of an archaeon P450. Subsequent cloning, expression, and purification of CYP119 led to the finding that CYP119 exhibits a melting temperature of ≈90 °C compared with ≈55 °C for mesophilic bacterial P450cam (3McLean M.A. Maves S.A. Weiss K.E. Krepich S. Sligar S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This was soon followed by our determination of the CYP119 crystal structure (4Yano J.K. Koo L.S. Schuller D.J., Li, H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31086-31092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), followed by an independent structure determination by Park et al. (5Park S.Y. Yamane K. Adachi S. Shiro Y. Maves S.A. Weiss K.E. Sligar S.G. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The enhanced thermal stability of CYP119 was attributed to an unusually large clustering of aromatic side chains not found in all other known P450 structures (3McLean M.A. Maves S.A. Weiss K.E. Krepich S. Sligar S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 4Yano J.K. Koo L.S. Schuller D.J., Li, H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J.

The ever increasing data base of known structures of proteins from both mesophiles and their thermophilic counterparts reveals that aromatic clustering does, indeed, correlate with enhanced thermal stability, but that this is only one of several possible mechanisms for enhancing thermal stability (7Zeikus J.G. Vieille C. Savchenko A. Extremophiles. 1998; 2: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Whether or not aromatic clustering is a universal feature of thermostable P450s will require additional crystal structures. Fortunately, the second P450 from a thermophile was recently discovered, CYP175A1 from Thermus thermophilus. The present report describes cloning, expression, purification, crystallization, and structure determination of CYP175A1, a cytochrome P450 from the thermophilic bacterium T. thermophilus HB27. The 44-kDa protein is soluble and displays an absorption spectra in the reduced, oxidized, and carbonyl adduct analogous to those of other P450 enzymes. We also demonstrate that this enzyme exhibits thermostability with a melting temperature 30 °C higher than that of P450cam. To understand whether CYP175A1 and CYP119 share common structural features related to thermal stability, the two crystal structures are compared. Plasmid DNA containing CYP175A1 was a kind gift from Dr. Hans-Joachim Fritz (University of Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to engineer EcoRI and PstI restriction sites into the CYP175A1 gene. The oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the new CYP175A1 gene from the original plasmid were the following: primer A, 5′-CCGGAATTCATGAAGCGCCTTTCCCTGAGG; primer B, 5-CCAATGCATTGGTTCTGCAGTCAGGCCCGCACCTCCTCCCTAGG. The new restriction sites, EcoRI and PstI, are underlined. The reaction mixture consisted of template DNA (100 ng), 2.5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), 5 μl reaction buffer, 5 μl of Me2SO, 0.4 μmamounts of each oligonucleotide, 400 μm dNTPs, and H2O up to 50 μl. PCR cycling parameters were: 95 °C for 1 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 53 °C for 1 min 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min 30 s; and 68 °C for 4 min. The CYP175A1 gene sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. After restriction enzyme digest of the gel-purified PCR product, the CYP175A1 gene was cloned into the EcoRI/PstI sites of the pKK233–3 plasmid (Amersham Biosciences). BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus Escherichia coli (Stratagene) were transformed with a pKK233–3 plasmid containing the gene for CYP175A1 from Tt. Single colonies were selected for overnight growth in 5-ml cultures, which were used to inoculate cultures (1 liter in each 2.8-liter flask). At an A 600 nm of 1.0, 500 μg/liter isopropyl β-d-thiopyranogalactoside (United States Biochemical Corp.) was used to induce the expression of CYP175A1. The conditions for cell growth were 2× YT (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, and 5 g of NaCl per liter), 0.1 g/liter ampicillin (Sigma), and 50 mg/liter chloramphenicol (Sigma) at 37 °C, with shaking at 220 rpm for the starter cultures and slow stirring (80–100 rpm) at 30 °C after induction. Forty-eight hours after induction, the cells were harvested and the cell paste was stored at −70 °C. Cells were lysed in a French pressure cell in 50 mmpotassium Pi buffer, pH 7.5, 0.1% Emulgen (Japan), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the cell-free extract was brought to 35% ammonium sulfate concentration by adding solid ammonium sulfate. Precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was brought to a concentration of 50% ammonium sulfate. The resulting precipitate was centrifuged, resuspended in minimal volume, and dialyzed against 50 mm potassium Pibuffer, pH 7.5, overnight (3 times buffer exchange). The dialyzed supernatant was passed over a DE52 column. Contaminant proteins stuck on the column, whereas CYP175A1 passed through because of its limited affinity for DE52 resin. The flow-through containing CYP175A1 had an absorbance ratio (A 418 nm/A 280 nm) of ≈1.3. The protein was concentrated further and diluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The protein was then loaded on to a hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column (2.5 × 20.0 cm). The protein was washed with two to three column volumes of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, followed by two to three column volumes of 50 mmpotassium Pi buffer, pH 7.4. The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.4, from 50 to 300 mm over 10 column volumes at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Fractions with an absorbance ratio (A 418 nm/A 280 nm) above 1.55 were pooled, concentrated, and exchanged into 50 mmTris, pH 7.4, on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was then concentrated to 40 mg/ml and stored at −20 °C. A visible extinction coefficient of ε418 nm = 104 mm−1 was determined by extracting and measuring the total amount of heme present in a pure sample using the pyridine hemochromagen assay (8Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 2370-2378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and compared with the spectra obtained for the intact protein. Purity was measured by the appearance of a single band on a Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-PAGE gel and had an absorbance ratio (A 418 nm/A 280 nm) of 1.60. The thermal melting temperatures were measured by recording the absorbance of the heme Soret peak at a linear temperature rate of 1 °C/min on a Cary 3E UV-visible spectrophotometer equipped with a temperature controller. All P450s were irreversibly denatured. P450BM-3 consists of the heme domain only (residues 1–455). The absorbance increase at the Soret peak was followed for CYP119 and CYP175A1, whereas the absorbance decrease was followed for all other P450s. All measurements were carried out in the absence of substrates in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, except CYP175A1, which was carried out in 50 mm potassium Pi buffer, pH 7.4. Protein concentrations ranged from 6 to 12 μm and corresponded to an absorbance from 1.0 to 0.8 at the Soret peak. The Soret peak was at 418 nm for P450BM-3, P450eryF, P450cam, and CYP175A1, whereas the CYP119 Soret peak was at 414 nm. The percentage denatured was calculated by the following equation depending on whether the appearance or disappearance of the Soret peak was measured (percentage of absorbance): appearance of the Soret peak = 1 − (peak absorbance 100% natured − observed absorbance); disappearance of the Soret peak = (peak absorbance − observed absorbance). Crystals belonging to the monoclinic space group P21 with unit cell dimensions a = 64.54 Å, b = 90.70 Å,c = 74.52 Å, β = 99.67o were grown by sitting-drop vapor diffusion at room temperature over a reservoir of 0.4 m sodium/potassium tartrate, 100 mm sodium citrate/phosphate, pH 4.2, and 1 mm 1-phenylimidazole or 4-phenylimidazole. Three μl of 20 mg/ml CYP175A1 was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution and used to set up sitting drops on siliconized glass cover slips. To prepare the heavy atom derivative, crystals were transferred into artificial precipitant solution containing saturating amounts of platinum diamino dichloride (Pfaltz and Bauer) and allowed to soak for 36 h prior to data collection. Cryoprotectant soaking consisted of a four-step transfer to artificial precipitant solution (0.2 mNa + /K + tartrate, 50 mm Na+ citrate/phosphate, pH 4.2, 1 mm 1-phenyl- or 4-phenylimidazole) with increasing concentrations of ethylene glycol from 5 to 30%. For crystals of the platinum derivative, saturating amounts of heavy atom were also added to the cryoprotectant solutions. A Matthews coefficient (9Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7922) Google Scholar) calculation indicated that there were most likely two molecules per asymmetric unit. All data were collected using crystals flash-frozen in a stream of liquid nitrogen. Initial data sets were collected in-house on an R-Axis IV image plate equipped with a Rigaku rotating copper anode x-ray generator and Osmic focusing optics. Collection of in-house native data was optimized to maximize the anomalous dispersion signal from the heme iron by collection of a highly redundant data set resulting in greater than 1 million observations of 61,926 unique reflections to 1.95 Å (Table I). A high resolution data set (50–1.80 Å) used for the final refinement was collected at the Advanced Light Source, beamline 5.0.2 with an Area Detector Systems Co. Quantum-4 CCD detector. Optimization of data collection was guided by the STRATEGY function of MOSFLM (10Leslie, A. G. W. (1992) Joint CCP4 ESF-EAMCB Newsletter Protein Crystallogr. 26Google Scholar). All data collected were reduced using DENZO and SCALEPACK (11Zbyszek Otwinowski W.M.

Open table in a new tab Phases were derived from molecular replacement, a platinum heavy atom derivative, and anomalous scattering from the heme iron. Molecular replacement was carried out using a combination of AMoRe (12Jorge Navanza P.S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 581-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and BEAST (13Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar) using data from 20 to 5 Å and a polyalanine search model of P450BM-3 (PDB accession no. 1FAG) with residues 1–15, 223–232, 293–303, and 337–350 deleted from the model. The rotation solution found in BEAST was used in AMoRe to find the translation solution for the first molecule. This provided a slightly higher signal to noise ratio than using the rotation solution generated in AMoRe alone, because the rotation solution generated by finer rotational step size in BEAST was closer to the final refined orientation. AMoRe was used to find both the rotation and translation solution for the second molecule. The log likelihood gain score for the first rotation in BEAST was 20.07 with a mean of 7.50. The rigid body fitting routine in AMoRe was applied to the final solutions and had a Patterson correlation coefficient score of 0.451 and a crystallographicR-factor of 52.7%. SOLVE (14Terwilliger T.G. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar) was used to interpret both the isomorphous difference Patterson from the platinum derivative and the native iron anomalous difference Patterson. SOLVE was able to locate two platinum sites and two iron sites in the asymmetric unit, in agreement with the predicted two molecules per asymmetric unit. The final Z score for the solution was 14.08 with an overall figure of merit of 0.41. Data from 12 to 2.8 Å were used for phase combination calculations using SIGMAA (15Fujinaga M. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 517-521Crossref Google Scholar). The combined phases were further improved by density modification using DM (16Cowtan K.D. Joint CCP4 ESF-EAMCB Newsletter Protein Crystallogr. 1994; 34: 34-38Google Scholar), including solvent flattening, histogram matching, and 2-fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging to provide an interpretable electron density map. Electron density map fitting beginning with the truncated P450BM-3 model was carried out with the graphic modeling package O (17Jones T. Kjeldgaard M. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 173-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Several sections of the electron density map, especially the core near the heme group, clearly showed the identity of CYP175A1 side chains. Regions of the molecule that lacked clear backbone electron density were deleted prior to refinement in CNS (version 1.1) (18Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Several rounds of model building, followed by refinements with simulated annealing (at 3000 K) and minimization, continued until the R-factor was ∼30%, and then isotropicB-factor refinement was introduced. In addition, simulated annealing omit maps were generated in CNS to assist in model building. When the R-factor reached ∼25%, water molecules were automatically picked at the 3.5 ς level in anFo − Fc difference map using CNS and manually added in for the last few rounds of refinements. The final stage of refinement was done with the program REFMAC5 (19Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). The final model consists of all the residues in molecule A except the last four at the C terminus, whereas molecule B is missing residues 11–15 as well as the last four residues. The final R-factor is 18.2% (R-free 22.8%), and none of the main-chain torsion angles were in the disallowed regions of a Ramachandran plot. Relevant statistics are found in TableI. Melting curves for the two thermophilic P450s, CYP175A1 and CYP119, and three mesophilic P450s are shown in Fig. 1. The three mesophilic P450s exhibit Tm values ranging from 47 to 61 °C, whereas CYP175A1 and CYP119 have Tm values of 88 and 91 °C, respectively. These values compare favorably for those obtained using the more rigorous technique of differential scanning calorimetry. In these experiments, the Tm for CYP119 was found to be 91 °C, whereas that for P450cam was 54 °C (3McLean M.A. Maves S.A. Weiss K.E. Krepich S. Sligar S.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Maves S.A. Sligar S.G. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the highest sequence identity to CYP175A1 is P450BM-3 at 26%. Based on this sequence identity, we chose P450BM-3 as the search model for molecular replacement. The solution to the phase problem for CYP175A1 by molecular replacement represents the only case where a known P450 structure could be used to solve both the rotation and translation functions. Previously, in the CYP119 structure determination (4Yano J.K. Koo L.S. Schuller D.J., Li, H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31086-31092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), the rotation solution for only one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit was obtained with a modified version of BRUTE (13Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1373-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar, 21Fujinaga M. Read R.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 517-521Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The rotation parameters for the second molecule could not be found using routine molecular replacement programs and were generated by application of the self-rotation peak. The present structure determination demonstrates the ability to use preexisting P450 structures as molecular replacement models despite low sequence identity found throughout the P450 superfamily. Although the molecular replacement phases generated an interpretable electron density map, the map was significantly improved by incorporating phases derived from the platinum derivative and iron sites. CYP175A1 exhibits the typical prism-like P450-fold (Fig. 2) composed of 17 α-helices and 11 β-strands, corresponding to four β segments. At the core of the molecule is a four-helix bundle composed of helices D, E, I, and L and two α-helices (J and K) (22Graham S.E. Peterson J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 369: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The heme prosthetic group is embedded between the distal I and proximal L helices, with Cys-336 serving as the fifth axial thiolate ligand to the heme iron. The propionate side chains of the heme are tethered to the protein through interactions with Trp-87, Arg-273, and Arg-334. The I helix spans the length of the entire molecule and contains the highly conserved Thr (Thr-225) residue, which is hydrogen-bonded to the peptide backbone. This region has been postulated to be involved in a proton shuttle network considered to be important for delivering solvent protons required for the activation of O2 during the catalytic cycle (23Raag R.

At 389 residues, CYP175A1 is comparable in size to CYP119 (378 residues), but considerably smaller than other known soluble bacterial P450s such as P450BM-3 (heme domain) at 455 residues. Crystals used in this study were prepared in the presence of 1-phenylimidazole. As a result, we expected to find this ligand in the active site pocket coordinated to the heme iron. As shown in Fig. 3, there is clearly defined electron density for the inhibitor with continuous density connecting the inhibitor and heme iron atom consistent with an imidazole N atom coordinating to the heme iron. Nevertheless, attempts to accurately model inhibitor to the electron density failed to give good fits. In sharp contrast, the similar inhibitor, 4-phenylimidazole, fit the electron density very well in CYP119. It appears that the inhibitor may either be partially occupied, thus sharing space with solvent, or the inhibitor is partially disordered. Spectral titration data do indicate that the inhibitor does not bind as well to CYP175A1 as to CYP119. The apparent K d is ≈0.3 μm for CYP119 and ≈83.7 μm for CYP175A1 in the same buffer used for crystallization. In both cases there are clearly defined spectral shifts characteristic of forming an N–Fe bond. Although the inhibitor binds more weakly to CYP175A1, it remains surprising that the inhibitor structure was not more well ordered and/or fully occupied given the large excess of 1-phenylimidazole (1 mm) used for crystallization. Because the closest homologue to CYP175A1 is P450BM-3, a bacterial fatty acid monooxygenase, we will next compare these two structures. The r.m.s. backbone deviation between CYP175A1 and palmitoleic acid-bound P450BM-3 (PDB accession no.1FAG) (25Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) is 1.64 Å for 304 Cα atoms. TableII provides a comparison of secondary structural elements, and Fig. 2 provides a structural picture of the two P450s. Most of the differences between CYP175A1 and P450BM-3 are located in the loops connecting helices. For example, P450BM-3 has a seven-residue insertion in the loop connecting helices E and F (residues 159–172 in P450BM-3, residues 146–152 in CYP175A1). Another difference includes the β-5 region in P450BM-3 (residues 239–250) compared with the loop found in CYP175A1 (residues 202–205), a difference of eight residues. This region forms a tight loop between the H and I helices, and resembles what was previously found in P450nor, which does not have a redox partner (26Park S.Y. Shimizu H. Adachi S. Nakagawa A. Tanaka I. Nakahara K. Shoun H. Obayashi E. Nakamura H. Iizuka T. Shiro Y. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 827-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and CYP119. In contrast, all other soluble bacterial P450 structures show this ill defined β-hairpin similar to P450BM-3. Interestingly, the crystal structure of a complex formed between the heme domain of P450BM-3 and FMN domain has shown that this hairpin region makes direct contact with the FMN domain (27Sevrioukova I.F., Li, H.

Open table in a new tab Although the redox partner for CYP175A1 remains unknown, it generally is thought that electrostatic interactions are important in redox partner recognition. Therefore, it is instructive to examine the electrostatic surface potential of CYP175A1 compared with P450cam and P450BM-3, where there is a fairly clear picture on the location of the docking site. The electrostatic surface potential of CYP175A1, P40cam, and P450BM-3 are shown in Fig. 4. Thearrows indicate the approximate location of the surface above the proximal Cys ligand. This region is known to be the docking site for the P450BM-3 redox partner (27Sevrioukova I.F., Li, H. Zhang H. Peterson J.A. Poulos T.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1863-1868Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and is generally considered the docking site in P450cam (28Pochapsky T. Lyons T.A. Kazanis S. Arakaki T. Ratnaswamy G. Biochimie ( Paris ). 1996; 78: 723-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The excess positive charge in this region provides favorable electrostatic interactions with negative charges on the redox partner. CYP175A1 also has a large positive electrostatic potential in this region, suggesting that this, too, may be a recognition site for redox partners. The larger positive potential on CYP175A1 on the proximal surface CYP175A1 compared with the other P450s is caused in part by an extra arginine, Arg-319, in CYP175A1 with no homologue in P450cam or P450BM-3. In addition, Arg-319 occupies approximately the same position in three dimensions as Glu-286 in P450cam; hence, CYP175A1 has one less negative charge in this region. This might provide an especially strong electrostatic docking site for the CYP175A1 redox partner. Another important region is the substrate binding environment, the F and G helices, B′ helix, and neighboring loops (Fig. 5). The F and G helices and the loop connecting these helices are known to undergo a large open/close motion between the substrate-free and -bound forms of P450BM-3 (25Li H. Poulos T.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 140-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). In addition, CYP119 undergoes a rather large structural change in the F/G region, depending on the type of ligand bound in the active site (4Yano J.K. Koo L.S. Schuller D.J., Li, H. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Poulos T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31086-31092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). When a small inhibitor, imidazole, is bound, the C-terminal end of the F helix in CYP119 unwinds, which increases the length of the F/G loop, thus allowing the F/G loop to dip down into the active site and interact with the inhibitor. These two examples illustrate the importance of the F/G region in substrate recognition and binding. It therefore is important to note that the major portions of the F-G region and the B′ helix, known to be important in substrate binding (29Gotoh O. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 83-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), are in nearly identical conformations in"

We have previously identified aTrypanosoma cruzi RNA-binding protein named TcUBP-1. This protein is involved in mRNA destabilization in vivothrough binding to AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated region of SMUG mucin mRNAs (D'Orso, I., and Frasch, A. C. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 34801–34809). In this work we show that TcUBP-1 is part of an ∼450-kDa ribonucleoprotein complex with a poly(A)-binding protein and a novel 18-kDa RNA-binding protein, named TcUBP-2. Recombinant TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-2 proteins recognize U-rich RNAs with similar specificity and affinity through the ∼92-amino acid RNA recognition motif. TcUBPs can homo- and heterodimerize in vitro through the glycine-rich C-terminal region. This interaction was also detected in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation of the ribonucleoprotein complex and using yeast two-hybrid assay. The poly(A)-binding protein identified was shown to disrupt the formation of TcUBP-1, but not TcUBP-2, homodimers in vitro. The possible role of TcUBP-1 ligands in the pathways that govern mRNA-stability and stage-specific expression in trypanosomes is discussed.

The parasite has a life cycle that includes a vertebrate and an insect vector, with different developmental stages involved in each host. In the insect, two main forms of the parasite are present: replicative epimastigotes and metacyclic trypomastigotes. The latter form is infective to humans after being released on the skin or mucosa with the feces of the bug. Metacyclic trypomastigotes invade host cells and differentiate into a replicative amastigote form that differentiates into bloodstream trypomastigotes. The latter stage is able to invade a wide variety of cells, thus propagating the infection. The cycle closes when the hematophagous vector ingests circulating trypomastigotes with its blood meal. Trypanosomes, protozoan parasites of the order Kinetoplastida, have particular features in terms of mechanisms leading to protein expression. RNA polymerase I promoters were identified in rDNA but also in genes encoding the variable surface antigens from African trypanosomes (1Vanhamme L. Pays E. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 223-240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, only few RNA polymerase II promoters were described (2Gilinger G. Bellofatto V. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1556-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). As part of the maturation process, a common 39-nucleotide RNA, named spliced leader, is added to all trypanosome mRNAs by a trans-splicing process. This phenomenon was shown to be couple to 3′-poly(A) tail addition during polycistronic RNA processing (3Matthews K.R. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). As a consequence, and at variance with higher eukaryotic cells, the control of protein expression in trypanosomatids is mainly post-transcriptional (4Clayton C.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1881-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). However, little information is available on the relative importance of these processes and how they operate jointly in the parasite. One of the possible mechanisms to regulate protein expression is through modification of the half-life of mRNAs. Severalcis-elements located throughout the mRNA, coding and/or untranslated regions (UTRs),1were identified (5Hehl A. Vassella E. Braun R. Roditi I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 370-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 6Nozaki T. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 75: 55-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Weston D., La Flamme A.C. Van Voorhis W.C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 102: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, only few of them were found to be recognized specifically by trans-acting factors (8D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15783-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We have found previously (9Di Noia J.M. D'Orso I. Sanchez D.O. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10218-10227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) two distinct cis-elements located in the 3′UTR of the mRNAs of a mucin surface antigen family named SMUG of T. cruzi. A 44-nucleotide AU-rich element (ARE) was shown to destabilize SMUG transcripts in the infective non-replicative trypomastigote stage of the parasite. Conversely, a 27-nucleotide G-rich cis-element stabilizes SMUG in the non-infective replicative epimastigote stage of the parasite (8D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15783-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). These results suggest that both elements, ARE and the G-rich cis-element, act coordinately in a developmentally regulated manner and are recognized by specific RNA-binding proteins (8D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15783-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recently, we described that this ARE sequence was recognized by a single RRM-type RNA-binding protein named TcUBP-1, for T. c ruzi Uridine-binding protein. In vivo, TcUBP-1 was shown to destabilize SMUG mRNAs in the epimastigote stage of the parasite (10D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34801-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Furthermore, and at variance with what occurs in yeast, the processes of 3′-5′ and 5′-3′ exonucleolityc cleavage were shown to be active in trypanosomes (11Irmer H. Clayton C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 4707-4715Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The identification of an exosome in T. brucei (12Estevez A.M. Kempf T. Clayton C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) suggests that an early mechanism of mRNA maturation, mediated by 3′-5′ exonucleases involved in 3′-end processing, might be a similar although more primitive process, compared with that present in higher eukaryotic cells (13Wang Z. Kiledjian M. Cell. 2001; 107: 751-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Therefore, the possibility of regulating the decay of ARE-containing mRNAs exists in trypanosomes. In this work, we delineate TcUBP-1 involvement in mRNA maturation processes by defining, in part, their protein ligands. We identified a ribonucleoprotein complex containing TcUBP-1 and demonstrated that it interacts specifically with two RRM-type RNA-binding proteins. The first ligand identified was TcPABP1, and its effect in the recognition of U-rich RNA by TcUBP-1 was studied. The second ligand was a novel 18-kDa U-rich RNA-binding protein named TcUBP-2. We provide evidence for the in vitro and in vivo interaction of TcUBP-1 with these ligands, as well as data suggesting that their association modulates TcUBP-1 binding with U-rich RNAs.

During the cloning ofTcubp-1 by RT-PCR using RNP-1 oligonucleotide (5′-aaacttcacaatccataggcc-3′) a second clone, named Tcubp-2, was identified. Another RT-PCR was done with primer oligo(dT(18))-anchor (5′-gcgactccgcggccgcg(t)18-3′). Second strand DNA synthesis was done with anchor and with a primer annealing at the N-terminal ofTcubp-2, named NH2-sense (5′-atgtctcaacagatgcaatac-3′). These products were cloned in pGEM-T Easy (Promega) and sequenced in an ABI Prism 373 sequencer. The sequence reported here has been submitted to GenBankTM with accession number AF497746. Tcubp-1 and Tcubp-2 cDNAs and partial deletions of both were amplified by PCR (see Table I). They were cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI restriction endonuclease sites of the pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Biosciences), generating a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion and transformed inEscherichia coli strain BL21 DE3 pLysS (Novagen). Cultures were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Recombinant proteins were purified using GST-agarose columns (Sigma).

Two specific peptides of TcUBP-1, VSQYDPYGQTAC, and TcUBP-2, RNRNGVSTFGAC, were synthesized (Sigma GENOSYS). The C-terminal cysteine residues were added to conjugate the peptides with maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides were injected into rabbits and mice with Freund's adjuvant three times at 2-week intervals. For Western blot analysis, samples were fractionated on SDS-PAGE gels transferred to HybondC nitrocellulose (AmershamBiosciences), probed with primary antibodies, and developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-mouse antibodies and the Supersignal® West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), according to manufacturer's instructions. A 249-bp fragment corresponding to Tcpabp1 C-terminal region (16Batista J.A. Teixeira S.M. Donelson J.E. Kirchhoff L.V. de Sa C.M. Mol. Biochem.

Tcpabp1 was amplified by PCR with primer PABP-N (5′-ggatccatgtcgaactttcctgctgcg-3′) and PABC-2. Both products were cloned into pGEX-2T vector (AmershamBiosciences) and induced as indicated above. An antibody against TcPABC was raised and named anti-TcPABP1. Cytosolic protein extracts and subcellular fractionation were done as described (8D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15783-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A cytosolic extract corresponding to 108 parasites or gel filtration chromatography column fractions were incubated with mouse pre-immune serum, anti-TcUBP-1, anti-TcUBP-2, or anti-TcPABP1 polyclonal antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle mixing. A 50% slurry of protein A-Sepharose was added to the mixture and incubated for 2 h more. The mixture was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 1 min, and the resin was washed four times with 300 μl of Tris-buffered saline-Tween 0.05%. Proteins were eluted with 2× Laemmli buffer. Gel filtration was carried out with 300 μl of an epimastigote protein extract (10 mg/ml) on a Bio-Sil SEC 250 column (Bio-Rad). A Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (AmershamBiosciences) was used for the determination of apparent molecular masses of the recombinant proteins. Columns were equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 150 mm NaCl. Fractions of 500 μl were collected and analyzed by Western blot. Where indicated, the extract was pre-treated with RNase A (USB) at a concentration 0.1 μg/μl during 30 min. TcUBP-1, TcUBP-2, and the deletion mutant proteins (Table I) were treated at room temperature with glutaraldehyde at a final concentration of 0.01% as indicated (17Wan L. Kim J.K. Pollard V.W. Dreyfuss G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7681-7688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The products were run on a SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. Homoribopolymers (rA, rC, rG, rU) were oxidized with NaIO4 and cross-linked to adipic acid dihydrazide-agarose beads (Sigma) as indicated previously (18Caputi M. Mayeda A. Krainer A.R. Zahler A.M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4060-4067Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Purified proteins or trypanosome extracts were incubated for 1 h with RNA cross-linked beads and washed. Protein elution was done with 2× Laemmli buffer. GST pull-down was carried out with 5 μg of GST or GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione beads (Sigma) and 5 μg of TcUBP-1 or TcUBP-2, without GST tag. Columns were equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline, and after washing with Tris-buffered saline-Triton 0.1%, eluted proteins were loaded onto a SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. RNA production was done according to previous protocols (8D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15783-15793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The RNAs synthesized were S, P1, P2, P3, and P1-GGG (see Fig. 5). Native mobility gel shift assays were done with the indicated protein amounts and RNA as previously described (10D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34801-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). All gel shift experiments were performed at least twice. Bands were quantified using Image Analysis software (Eastman Kodak Co.). K d values were calculated by plotting the ratio of bound RNA/free RNA against protein concentration. Saccharomyces cerevisiaeL40 cells were transformed sequentially with pBTM116 plasmid expressing a LexA-DNA-binding domain (DBD) fusion protein and pVP16 plasmid expressing a VP16 transcription activation domain fusion protein and were grown at 28 °C in synthetic medium Yc-TULLH (Trp−, Ura−, Leu−, Lys−, His−) (19Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4838) Google Scholar). An interaction between the DBD and the activation domain of the fusion proteins results in the production of the HIS3 gene product and enables the cells to grow on minimal medium lacking histidine. β-Galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously (19Fields S.

Plasmids pBTM116 and pVP16 were a kind gift from Dr. Tellez-Inon (Instituto de Investigaciones en Ingeniería Genética y Biología Molecular). DuringTcubp-1 cloning (10D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34801-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we also identified, by RT-PCR, a second clone. It was named Tcubp-2 because of its identity with Tcubp-1. We demonstrated by Southern blot thatTcubp-2 is present as a single copy gene per haploid genome (not shown). TcUBP-2, as TcUBP-1, has a short N-terminal region. Only 20 amino acids are present in TcUBP-2, and glutamine accounts for the majority of them (45%). A deletion of about 14 residues is present within the N-terminal region of TcUBP-2 (Fig. 1 A). The RRM motif (∼92 amino acids) presents conserved RNP domains (Fig. 1, A andB) (20Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1726) Google Scholar), and its identity is 98% (Fig. 1 A). The C-terminal region of the RRM, 8 amino acids after β4 sheet (Fig. 1 A), is different between TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-2. Therefore, we named this sequence variable region (VR). Finally, a glycine-rich C-terminal region, with YGG motives, is present in TcUBP-2 (Fig. 1 A). TcUBP-2 C-terminal is shorter than that of TcUBP-1 and lacks the glutamine-rich random-coil region (10D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34801-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A Western blot analysis was performed with an anti-RRM polyclonal antibody using a total parasite extract of the epimastigote stage. The anti-RRM antibody recognized three protein bands of 18, 27, and 45 kDa (Fig. 2 A). Both 27- and 45-kDa protein bands were suggested to be TcUBP-1 isoforms, but only the 27-kDa band has the expected size for Tcubp-1 coding region. Previously, we observed that the 45-kDa isoform increases after parasite transformation with Tcubp-1. This result suggested that the 45-kDa isoform might correspond to a post-translationally modified form of TcUBP-1 (10D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34801-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To simplify the nomenclature, TcUBP-1 will refer to the 27-kDa protein and TcUBP-1m, m from modified, to the 45-kDa protein. To confirm that they are indeed codified byTcubp-1, we raised antibodies against the N-terminal region of TcUBP-1 and named it anti-TcUBP-1 antibody. This antiserum identified both the 27- and 45-kDa bands, signals that were undetectable when the antiserum was pre-adsorbed with GST-TcUBP-1 protein (Fig. 2 B). On the other hand, the 18-kDa protein band corresponds to the expected size derived for Tcubp-2coding region (165 amino acids, 18.4 kDa). To confirm whether this protein is indeed TcUBP-2, we raised antibodies against a peptide of its central region from the amino acids 111 to 122 (Fig. 1 A) and named it anti-TcUBP-2. This antibody recognized GST-TcUBP-2 and not GST-TcUBP-1 (Fig. 2 C). Additionally, the specificity of the anti-TcUBP-2 antibody was demonstrated. Pre-adsorption of the antibody with GST-TcUBP-2 abolished its interaction with the 18-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 2 C). This result demonstrated the specificity for the anti-TcUBP-2 antibody and also confirmed that the 18-kDa protein is indeed TcUBP-2. TcUBP-2 expression levels were analyzed by Western blot, using total parasite extracts from the different stages of the parasite. TcUBP-2 was detected preferentially in epimastigotes (Fig. 2 D), showing that it is expressed differentially during parasite development. As control of this experiment, the same filter was reacted with an antibody made against the poly(A)-binding protein (16Batista J.A. Teixeira S.M. Donelson J.E. Kirchhoff L.V. de Sa C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), showing that it is detected in all stages of the parasite. To verify whether TcUBP-2 presents functional RNA-binding activity, an in vitro binding assay was performed. The homoribopolymers (rA, rC, rG, and rU) were cross-linked to dihydrazide-agarose beads. A trypanosome total protein extract from the epimastigote stage was prepared and passed through the four columns, and the eluted proteins were run in SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot using an anti-RRM antibody. TcUBP-2, as TcUBP-1 isoforms, was recognized only in the fraction bound to poly(U) column and not to other homoribopolymers (Fig. 2 E). The cellular localization of TcUBPs proteins was performed by a biochemical fractionation, demonstrating that they are located preferentially in the polysomal fraction (not shown). Because TcUBP-1 was shown to be involved in post-transcriptional regulation (10D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34801-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), it might exert its effect through protein-protein interactions. Thus, we asked whether TcUBP-1 forms a protein complex in vivo in the epimastigote stage. Gel filtration experiments were performed with cell-free extracts pre-treated with Buffer A (150 mm NaCl) and Buffer B (150 mm NaCl, ∼0.1 μg/μl RNase A). After pre-treatment of the extracts for 30 min, they were applied on a Bio-Sil SEC 250 column, and the eluates were analyzed by Western blot using anti-RRM antibody. In the treatment of the extract with Buffer A, we observed that TcUBP-1 isoforms and TcUBP-2 were detected in a high molecular mass RNA-protein complex of ∼450 kDa (Fig. 3 A, lane 9). TcUBP-1 was also detected in fraction 17 of an apparent molecular mass of ∼27 kDa. This band might correspond to the monomer form. Conversely, TcUBP-2 was detected between fractions corresponding to 17 and 45 kDa (Fig. 3 A, lanes 16–19) and also in fraction 12 of ∼250 kDa. In the presence of Buffer B, all protein bands from the fraction corresponding to the ∼450-kDa complex disappeared (Fig. 3 B, lane 9), whereas the position of TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-2 in between fractions 16 and 19 did not change significantly. Thus, because Buffer B contains RNase A, these results suggest that an RNA component might be important for the RNA-protein interactions and complex formation. The amount of a trypomastigote stage protein extract used in two different gel chromatography experiments did not allow the detection of bands in Western blot analysis (not shown). To determine whether TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-2 proteins interact in vivo, as suspected from the gel chromatography profiles from Fig. 3 A, immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Fraction 9 in Fig. 3 Awas pre-treated or not for 30 min with RNase A and immunoprecipitated with pre-immune, anti-TcUBP-1, or anti-TcUBP-2 polyclonal antibodies followed by a Western blot using the anti-RRM antibody (Fig. 4 A). Both TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-2 were detected independently of the treatment of the extract with RNase, suggesting that they were associated in vivo by protein-protein interaction. However, it was difficult to detect TcUBP-1m under these experimental conditions (Fig. 4 A). TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-2 homo- and heterodimerization was corroborated through a two-hybrid assay, performed in L40 yeast strain and using LexA-DNA binding and VP16 activation domain hybrid proteins (see below). In higher eukaryotic cells, PABP1 protein is part of a multiprotein complex formed in the 3′UTR of ARE-containing mRNAs (21Wilusz C.J. Wormington M. Peltz S.W. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Because TcUBP-1 binds to SMUG 3′UTR and regulates its mRNA stability levels, we asked whether TcPABP1 might be present in this complex. An immunoprecipitation was carried out with anti-TcUBP-1, anti-TcUBP-2, or anti-TcPABP1 antibodies followed by a Western blot using the anti-TcPABP1 antibody. We found evidence that the ribonucleoprotein complex containing the heterodimer also contains TcPABP1 (Fig. 4 B). Although two different bands of 55 and 66 kDa were detected, the 66-kDa band was described as being TcPABP1 (16Batista J.A. Teixeira S.M. Donelson J.E. Kirchhoff L.V. de Sa C.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 67: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A two-hybrid assay was performed to corroborate TcUBP-1 homo- and heterodimerization with TcUBP-2 in a heterologous system. The coding sequence of TcUBP-1 was fused to the LexA-DBD in the plasmid pBTM116 to serve as bait (19Fields S. Song O. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4838) Google Scholar). Alone, LexA-DBD-TcUBP-1 did not give any detectable levels of GAL4-dependent synthesis of lacZ in the L40 yeast strain used (not shown). Therefore, TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-2 cDNAs were cloned into the pVP16 fused to VP16 activation domain. We test them in binding assay with LexA-DBD-TcUBP-1. The co-transformation of L40 yeast strain with LexA-TcUBP-1 and VP16-TcUBP-1 or VP16-TcUBP-2 allowed the growth of transformants on medium without histidine and also displays lacZ activity (not shown). Negative results were obtained with control yeast transformed with LexA-DBD-TcUBP-1 and VP16 alone. Thus, the interaction between TcUBP-1/TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-1/TcUBP-2 was specific. These results demonstrate that TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-2 proteins have the potential to interact in vivo in a heterologous system, corroborating the immunoprecipitation results (Fig. 4 A). We next analyzed the interaction of TcUBPs and TcPABP1 throughout parasite development. Total trypanosome extracts were prepared from the different parasite stages, incubated with anti-TcUBP-1 antibody for immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blot with anti-TcPABP1. This experiment demonstrated that TcUBP-1 interacts with TcPABP1 in the epimastigote and trypomastigote stages (Fig. 4 C). Conversely, TcUBP-2 co-precipitates with TcPABP1 in the epimastigote stage (Fig. 4 B) and not in other parasite stages (not shown). Because the complex containing TcUBPs in epimastigotes was disrupted by RNase A treatment (Fig. 3 B), we asked whether the interaction between TcUBP-1 and TcPABP1 in this stage was dependent on RNA. Immunoprecipitations were done with anti-TcUBP-1 antibody using cell-free extracts pre-treated or not for 30 min with RNase A. When the extract was RNase-treated there was no detectable TcPABP1 in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 4 D). Conversely, in the trypomastigote stage the interaction was not dependent on RNA, showing that TcUBP-1 and TcPABP1 make direct protein-protein contact. The binding specificity of TcUBP-2 was tested and compared with TcUBP-1. An electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed with a labeled U-rich element named P1, in the presence of different amounts of each of the four homoribopolymers (Fig. 5 B). We found that TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-2 RNA-binding activity was competed in a concentration-dependent manner with poly(U) and not by poly(A) or poly(C). In addition, it can be competed at high concentrations (500×) of poly(G) (Fig. 5 B). These results confirmed that recombinant proteins recognize poly(U) RNA, as do the native ones (see Fig. 2 E). Different U-rich RNAs were used to determine by EMSA the apparent dissociation constants (K d) of the ribonucleoprotein complexes formed by TcUBP-2 and TcUBP-1 (Fig. 5). The apparentK d for each reaction was calculated by determining the protein concentration at which 50% of the RNA was bound. TcUBP-2 recognized P1 RNA with an apparent K d of ∼100 nm, and TcUBP-1 recognized it with a K dof ∼150 nm. A new RNA, which has three uridine to guanosine changes in the last U-rich stretch of P1, was made and named P1-GGG (see Fig. 5 A). These changes had a slight effect on TcUBP-2 K d (∼200 nm) and TcUBP-1K d (∼250 nm). As it was described with TcUBP-1 (10D'Orso I. Frasch A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34801-34809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the S RNA (see Fig. 5) is bound by TcUBP-2 with a slightly high K d (∼250 nm). Conversely, P2 and P3 RNAs (Fig. 5), which have shorter U-rich stretches, were recognized by TcUBP-2 but with lower affinities (K d values of ∼750 and ∼850 nm, respectively) (Table II). These results suggest that U-rich stretches are the most important component of the RNA recognized by TcUBPs proteins. Also, GU-rich RNAs are better recognized than AU-rich sequences, and the RNA-binding activity of TcUBP-1 was clearly similar to TcUBP-2 (Fig. 5,C and D). A summary of TcUBPs RNA-binding activities is shown in Table II. This comparison reflects that TcUBP-1 and TcUBP-2 have similar K d values to the U-rich RNAs tested in this work.Table IIComparison between the Kds of TcUBP-1 and TcUBP"

Particularly, JNK3 is considered to be a degenerative enzyme with c-Jun as a relevant substrate. The contribution of individual JNK isoforms, however, to pathological as well as to physiological processes remains to be defined. To analyze the effects of a single JNK isoform on neuronal cell death and differentiation, we transfected PC12 cells, which normally express only JNK1 and JNK2, with JNK3-p54. Transfected JNK3 significantly enhanced cell death after UV irradiation (0.5–6 J/cm2) and paclitaxel/taxol treatment (1–10 μm). In contrast, in the context of nerve growth factor-induced (10 or 50 ng/ml) differentiation of PC12 cells, JNK3 expression significantly increased the number and length of neurites. This functional dichotomy of JNK3 was mirrored by differential activation and induction of nuclear JNK substrates; although activating transcription factor-2 phosphorylation was enhanced by death signaling in response to UV and taxol, c-Jun protein expression and N-terminal phosphorylation were increased during nerve growth factor-induced differentiation. The absence of significant JNK activation or target phosphorylation in response to H2O2 (60 μm) further supports the hypothesis that JNK isoforms are not merely injury- or stress-specific kinases but also have context-specific physiological functions.

Lin Y.G. Ciallella J.R. Flood D.G. Scott R.W. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Parkinson's disease (2Saporito M.S. Thomas B.A. Scott R.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 1200-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), as well as in cellular stress responses (Ref. 3Coffey E.T. Hongisto V. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Courtney M.J. J.

The JNK family consists of the ubiquitously expressed JNK1 and JNK2 and of JNK3, which is primarily expressed in the heart, brain, and testis (5Ip Y.T. Davis R.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 205-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 6Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). Differential splicing and exon usage yield a total of 10 different isoforms. After activation, JNKs phosphorylate various substrates in the nucleus, e.g. c-Jun or activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), and in the cytoplasm, e.g.Bcl-2, neurofilaments or tau (6Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 7Giasson B.I. Mushynski W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30404-30409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). JNKs were first described as stress kinases, and it is their involvement in the response to cellular stress that has been studied extensively (6Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar, 8Davis R.J. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2802) Google Scholar). Especially JNK3 has mostly been associated with apoptosis in pathological contexts and, because of its defined expression, predominantly with neuronal apoptosis. For example, disruption of the mouse JNK3 gene caused resistance to the excitotoxic glutamate receptor agonist kainic acid, with reduction in seizure activity and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons (10Yang D.D. Kuan C.Y. Whitmarsh A.J. Rincon M. Zheng T.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 865-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1105) Google Scholar). JNK3 is likely to contribute to ischemic death in perinatal and adult rats (11Chihab R. Ferry C. Koziel V. Monin P. Daval J.L. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 63: 105-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 12Shackelford D.A. Yeh R.Y. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 94: 178-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In cortical and cerebellar neurons, JNK3 holds a central role in apoptosis caused by UV irradiation, β-amyloid, growth factor withdrawal, and sodium arsenite (13Namgung U. Xia Z. J.

Flavell R. Slack R.S. Park D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35586-35596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Finally, a crucial function has been attributed to JNK3 in the induction of p75-mediated apoptosis in oligodendrocytes (18Harrington A.W. Kim J.Y. Yoon S.O. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 156-166Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the majority of reports indicate a pro-apoptotic role for JNKs. Their function, however, is clearly not restricted to apoptosis. Already at the beginning of JNK research, a dichotomous role for activated JNKs and their phosphorylated substrate c-Jun was suggested in neuronal injury connecting cell death with the competence for regeneration (19Coffey E.T. Smiciene G. Hongisto V. Cao J. Brecht S. Herdegen T. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4335-4345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Herdegen T. Blume A. Buschmann T. Georgakopoulos E. Winter C.

The wide range of JNK actions is further emphasized by the observation that within a single cell, different subpools of JNKs have distinct functions (3Coffey E.T. Hongisto V. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Courtney M.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7602-7613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In summary, JNKs have an extensive potential to perform different actions. However, the contribution of individual isoforms is still obscure. During the last decades, the rat pheochromocytoma cell line PC12 has been established as a model system for neuronal apoptosis as well as for neuronal differentiation and neurite outgrowth in response to NGF. Therefore, PC12 cells are the system of choice for investigating the potential of JNKs in the context of neuronal apoptosis and differentiation. Importantly, PC12 cells only express JNK1 and JNK2 (30Butterfield L. Zentrich E. Beekman A. Heasley L.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 31Mielke K. Damm A. Yang D.D. Herdegen T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 75: 128-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and these qualities render PC12 cells into a well defined cell culture system for the analysis of transfected JNK3. In the present study, we have investigated the capacity of a single JNK3 isoform for the propagation of cell death and differentiation. We demonstrate that the expression of JNK3 promotes cell death after UV irradiation and application of taxol but not after H2O2. On the other hand, however, transfected JNK3 significantly increases NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. Concomitant with the shift of function is the switch of JNK3 substrates, changing from ATF-2 in the apoptotical context to c-Jun during neuronal differentiation. Our results not only shed new light on the role of ATF-2 in the context of cell death but also define a model case for the dichotomous role of JNKs in coupling neuronal cell death and regeneration (32Herdegen T. Skene P. Bahr M. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The following materials were used: anti-active JNK (Promega), anti-c-Jun (Santa Cruz), anti-mouse IgG (AmershamBiosciences), anti-neurofilament (Sigma), anti-phospho-ATF-2 and anti-phospho-c-Jun (Cell Signaling Technologies), pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech), ECL detection system (AmershamBiosciences), fetal calf serum (Bio Whittaker), H2O2 (Sigma), Geneticin (G418) (Stratagene), horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Cell Signaling Technologies), horse serum (Invitrogen), Hyperfilm (AmershamBiosciences), Immobilon-P (Millipore), paclitaxel/taxol (Calbiochem), penicillin/streptomycin solutions (Invitrogen), phosphatase inhibitor mixture II (Sigma), Ponceau S (Sigma), recombinant mouse NGF (2.5 S) (alomone labs), protease inhibitor (complete) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen), TransFast transfection (Promega), and trypan blue stain (Sigma). Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were cultured on collagen-coated plates in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated calf serum, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Transfected cell clones were kept in the presence of 500 μg/ml G418 to maintain selection. cDNA of stress-activated protein kinase C/stress-activated protein kinase β/p54-β (GenBankTM accession number L27128) from rat brain was inserted into the expression vector pEGFP-C3 as aXhoI/SalI fragment. Transfection of the JNK3-EGFP construct or the pEGFP vector was performed using the TransFast transfection system according to the manufacturer's instructions. Individual stable clones that expressed the JNK3-EGFP construct or the pEGFP vector were selected and used for experiments. The same results were obtained with three independent PC12 clones. PC12 cells were plated and kept in serum-containing medium for 24 h. Before the addition of NGF, the cells were cultured in medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin for 72 h. All of the experiments with NGF were conducted with medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. The percentage of cells with neurites longer than 1.5 diameters of the cell body were counted on days 3 and 5 of the differentiation process. The length of neurites was measured using LeicaQwin software (Leica). Subconfluent PC12 cells were stimulated at different time points. Before harvesting, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. For whole cell extracts, the cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mmTris, pH 7.4, 2% SDS, 1% phosphatase inhibitor, protease inhibitor), incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, briefly sonicated, and centrifuged to remove insoluble material (15,000 × g for 15 min). For nuclear extracts, the cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% phosphatase inhibitor and protease inhibitor on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation (12,000 × g for 5 min), pelleted nuclei were washed in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1% phosphatase inhibitor, and protease inhibitor and resuspended in lysis buffer (see above) and treated as described for whole cell lysates. The protein extracts were stored at −80 °C. 20 μg of total cellular proteins and 10 μg of nuclear proteins were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membranes. The membranes were blocked with 4% nonfat dry milk and incubated with the primary antibodies according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After three washing steps with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min. All of the Western blots were developed using the ECL chemiluminescence system and Hyperfilm ECL. Between the stainings with phosphospecific antibodies and total kinase or total transcription factor antibodies, the blots were stripped in 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at 50 °C, washed with Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20, and blocked again. All of the measurements of dual phosphorylated kinase levels were normalized by hybridization with antibodies against total kinase protein. To normalize for the protein content of each lane and to confirm equal loading, all of the membranes were finally stained with Ponceau S, scanned, and analyzed with the densitometrical software Scion Image. All of the Western blots were exposed to film for varying lengths of time, and only films generating subsaturating levels of intensity were selected for densitometrical and statistical evaluation. The bands were quantified using Scion Image software. Normal distribution of the data was verified by calculating Lilliefors probabilities based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Statistical significance was determined using the t test for independent samples, and the respective results are displayed as the means ± S.D. All of the experiments and measurements were replicated at least three times. After the selection of stable clones, vector- and JNK3-transfected PC12 cells were monitored with regard to cell morphology, growth characteristics, and the expression status of different mitogen-activated protein kinases and their substrates. No morphological changes were detected; under normal growth conditions, both untransfected and transfected PC12 cells had a round or polygonal shape and did not extend processes (Fig. 1 A). Apart from their similar appearance, all of the cells displayed an almost identical growth rate with a doubling time of ∼72 h. When screened for the expression of different mitogen-activated protein kinases and their substrates, the transfection with pEGFP or JNK3-EGFP did not cause any changes in the amount of JNK1, JNK2, p38α, ERK1/2, or ATF-2 (Fig. 1 B); neither did transfection lead to the induction of c-Jun (data not shown). Furthermore, the amount of JNK3 protein produced by the transfected cells was comparable with that of JNK1 and JNK2 (Fig. 1 B). All of the transfected cells used for the experiments were constantly checked for well detectable green fluorescence. To investigate the effect of different stress stimuli on the phosphorylation of all JNK isoforms, PC12 cells were stimulated with UV irradiation (0.5, 2, or 6 J/cm2; 312 nm), H2O2 (60 μm), or paclitaxel/taxol (1 μm, 5 μm, or 10 μm) and incubated for 90 min before protein extraction. JNK activities were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies directed against dual phosphorylated JNK isoforms. UV irradiation induced a dose-dependent phosphorylation of total JNK (2-, 4-, and 6-fold for 0.5, 2, and 6 J/cm2 UV, respectively; Fig. 2 A). Following transfection, UV caused a similar activation of JNK3 (2-, 3-, and 5-fold, respectively; Fig. 2 A). In contrast, H2O2 stimulation hardly affected JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). Taxol, which suppresses mitotic spindle assembly and thereby induces microtubule damage, evoked a dose-dependent response with a 2.5–3-fold activation of all JNK isoforms (Fig. 2 B). In all experiments, protein expression did not change (Fig. 2). To investigate whether the expression and activation of JNK3 affected other stress kinases, we analyzed the phosphorylation of p38α by Western blotting. Wild type, vector-transfected, or JNK3-transfected PC12 cells showed no differences with regard to p38α activation (data not shown). To examine whether the phosphorylation of JNK3 had any influence on cell survival, PC12 cells were stimulated with UV, H2O2, and taxol as described above. After 18 h (UV irradiation and H2O2) or 24 h (taxol), the cell survival rates were determined by trypan blue staining. JNK3-transfected PC12 cells showed a significantly reduced viability after 2 and 6 J/cm2 UV (42 and 5%) as compared with wild type (60 and 12%) and vector-transfected cells (66 and 11%) (p < 0.02; Fig. 3). Thus, transfected JNK3 decreased cell survival by 30% (2 J/cm2) or 58% (6 J/cm2) compared with wild type cells. Similarly, JNK3 significantly enhanced cell death for all concentrations of taxol by a further 18% (1 μm), 20% (5 μm), and 33% (10 μm) as compared with wild type cells (p < 0.02; Fig. 3). In contrast, there was no increase in cell death of JNK3-transfected cells after treatment with H2O2 (Fig. 3). This finding shows that the expression of JNK3 and the subsequently increased supply of JNKs did not automatically integrate JNKs in the realization of cell death to all stimuli but rather emphasizes the selectivity and specificity of JNK functions. To control the cell death rates observed with trypan blue staining, lactate dehydrogenase release assays were conducted that confirmed the results obtained so far (data not shown). The two transcription factors c-Jun and ATF-2 are commonly associated with the JNK stress response. Therefore, we studied the effects of JNK3 activation on the phosphorylation of c-Jun and ATF-2 in PC12 cells following UV irradiation (0.5, 2, and 6 J/cm2; 312 nm), H2O2 (60 μm), and taxol (5 μm). The nuclear proteins were extracted after an incubation time of 90 min. ATF-2 phosphorylation was significantly increased in response to the high UV doses and to taxol treatment in JNK3-transfected cells as compared with wild type and vector-transfected cells (p< 0.05; Fig. 4, A andB), whereas the expression of ATF-2 protein did not change (Fig. 4 A). Similar to H2O2-induced cell death (see above), JNK3 transfection did not alter ATF-2 phosphorylation in response to H2O2 (Fig. 4,A and B). Following UV irradiation and taxol stimulation, we detected a similar increase in c-Jun protein expression and N-terminal phosphorylation in the transfected and untransfected PC12 cells (Fig. 4 C). Normalization of phospho-c-Jun and c-Jun levels showed that the overall increase in phosphorylated c-Jun was partly due to the enhanced expression of the c-Jun protein. Similar to the minor effect on JNK phosphorylation, H2O2 did not enhance c-Jun phosphorylation or protein expression, whereas taxol evoked the strongest c-Jun induction and phosphorylation in JNK3-transfected cells (Fig. 4 C). JNKs have been associated with neurite outgrowth in vitro (25Kita Y. Kimura K.D. Kobayashi M. Ihara S. Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S., Ui, M. Iba H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Nagata S. Fukui Y. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 907-915Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and regeneration in vivo (21Herdegen T. Claret F.X. Kallunki T. Martin-Villalba A. Winter C. Hunter T. Karin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5124-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Kenney A.M. Kocsis J.D. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1318-1328Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine whether JNK3 takes part in the process of neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells, we treated serum-starved PC12 cells with different doses of NGF (10 and 50 ng/ml) for 3 and 5 days. At these time points, JNK activities were analyzed in whole cell extracts. JNK1 and JNK2 were phosphorylated to a similar extent in JNK3-transfected cells (1.3- and 2.3-fold) and in wild type cells (1.5- and 2-fold), but JNK3 showed an enhanced response (2.5- and 3-fold) to NGF treatment (Fig. 5). JNK protein levels did not change (Fig. 5). Because transfection of PC12 cells with JNK3 led to an altered phosphorylation pattern of ATF-2 in response to apoptotic stress stimuli (see above), we investigated the expression and phosphorylation levels of c-Jun and ATF-2 in nuclear proteins on days 3 and 5 of the differentiation process. Importantly, transfection with JNK3 increased the induction and phosphorylation of c-Jun (Fig. 5), whereas ATF-2 phosphorylation was equal in untransfected and transfected cells (Fig. 5). To further characterize the differentiation processes induced by NGF and the involvement of JNK3, we determined the expression and phosphorylation of the heavy unit of the neurofilament protein (NF-H), which is a JNK substrate as well as a feature of neuronal differentiation in PC12 cells. For this purpose, we used an antibody that detected both the phosphorylated and the unphosphorylated form. Transfection of JNK3 substantially increased the expression and/or phosphorylation of NF-H as compared with wild type or vector-transfected cells (Fig. 5). In JNK3-transfected cells, treatment with 10 ng/ml NGF significantly accelerated the morphological changes linked to the neuronal phenotype as compared with wild type and vector-transfected cells (Fig. 6 A). Thereby, transfected JNK3 was present both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm (Fig. 6 B); even though the cytoplasm contained substantially more JNK3 (Fig. 6 C), the presence of JNK3 in the nucleus was repeatedly established by microscopic analysis. This confirms the finding that JNK3 transfection affected both cytoplasmic and nuclear JNK substrates (Fig. 5). Analysis of the differentiation status after 3 and 5 days of NGF application revealed an increase in both the number of neurites (p < 0.000001; Fig. 7 A) and the length of neurites (Fig. 7 B) as compared with wild type and vector-transfected cells. The enhanced length of the neurites became apparent on day 5 with a higher percentage of neurites longer than 40 μm in JNK3 transfected cells (57%) compared with wild type (32%) or vector-transfected cells (35%). A similar effect was observed with 50 ng/ml NGF (data not shown).Figure 7Transfection of PC12 cells with JNK3 increases formation and elongation of neurites in response to NGF (10 ng/ml).

Transfection of JNK3 into PC12 cells, which normally only express the JNK1 and JNK2 isoforms, significantly enhanced cell death in response to UV irradiation and taxol. In the context of NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells, however, transfected JNK3 evoked a substantial increase in the number and length of neurites compared with untransfected cells. This functional dichotomy of JNK3 was mirrored by a differential activation and induction of nuclear JNK substrates,i.e. enhanced phosphorylation of ATF-2 following death signaling in response to UV or taxol and increased expression and phosphorylation of c-Jun during NGF-induced differentiation. The absence of significant JNK activation or target phosphorylation in response to the stress stimulus H2O2 supports our hypothesis (21Herdegen T. Claret F.X. Kallunki T. Martin-Villalba A. Winter C. Hunter T. Karin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5124-5135Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Herdegen T. Skene P. Bahr M. Trends Neurosci. 1997; 20: 227-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) that JNKs, including JNK3, are not merely injury- or stress-specific kinases but also have relevant physiological functions depending on the cellular context and the switch of nuclear effector substrates. We have extended the knowledge about intracellular alterations in mammalian cells triggered by UV irradiation (33Rosette C. Karin M. Science. 1996; 274: 1194-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar) by novel insights into the function of JNKs. UV irradiation activated all of the JNK isoforms and induced expression and N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun. In this context, transfected JNK3 not only increased cell death but enhanced the phosphorylation of ATF-2, whereas c-Jun expression and activation was not affected by the increased pool of JNK molecules. UV irradiation is a particularly strong stimulus for both the activation of JNKs, including JNK3, and the expression/phosphorylation of c-Jun (30Butterfield L. Zentrich E. Beekman A. Heasley L.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 34Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M.

Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2934) Google Scholar). The fact that transfected JNK3 had no impact on c-Jun expression and phosphorylation suggests that c-Jun activation following UV is mediated via the Ras/ERK pathway (36Fritz G. Kaina B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1768-1774Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 37Huang C., Ma, W.Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2828-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) rather than by the characteristic phospho-c-Jun autoregulatory loop (38Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys.

It remains to be elucidated whether the function of the Ras/ERK pathway is confined to the induction of c-Jun or includes a JNK-independent N-terminal phosphorylation of c-Jun (40Cruzalegui F.H. Hardingham G.E. Bading H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1335-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is the ATF-2 transcription factor that serves as the predominant nuclear receptor for JNKs in response to UV irradiation (41Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

In this study, we have examined the effect of post-translational modifications of PSGL-1 including Tyr sulfation and presentation of sialylated and fucosylated O-glycans for L-selectin binding. The functional importance of these modifications was determined by analyzing soluble L-selectin binding and leukocyte rolling on CHO cells expressing various glycoforms of PSGL-1 or mutant PSGL-1 targeted at N-terminal Thr or Tyr residues. Simultaneous expression of core-2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase and fucosyltransferase VII was required for optimal L-selectin binding to PSGL-1. Substitution of Thr-57 by Ala but not of Thr-44, strongly decreased L-selectin binding and leukocyte rolling on PSGL-1. Substitution of Tyr by Phe revealed that PSGL-1 Tyr-51 plays a predominant role in mediating L-selectin binding and leukocyte rolling whereas Tyr-48 has a minor role, an observation that contrasts with the pattern seen for the interactions between PSGL-1 and P-selectin where Tyr-48 plays a key role. Molecular modeling analysis of L-selectin and P-selectin interactions with PSGL-1 further supported these observations. Additional experiments showed that core-2O-glycans attached to Thr-57 were also of critical importance in regulating the velocity and stability of leukocyte rolling. These observations pinpoint the structural characteristics of PSGL-1 that are required for optimal interactions with L-selectin and may be responsible for the specific kinetic and mechanical bond properties of the L-selectin-PSGL-1 adhesion receptor-counterreceptor pair.

The molecular contacts between P-selectin and PSGL-1 were identified by the analysis of the crystal structure of P-selectin co-complexed with the N-terminal peptide of PSGL-1 (23Somers W.S. Tang J.

These studies revealed the involvement of Tyr-48 and -51, but no interaction was observed between P-selectin and Tyr-46 (23Somers W.S. Tang J. Shaw G.D. Camphausen R.T. Cell. 2000; 103: 467-479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). Previous observations indicated the involvement of O-glycans attached to Thr-57 and tyrosine sulfate residues in supporting L-selectin- and P-selectin-mediated rolling (35Ramachandran V. Nollert M.U.

In the present study, we characterized the PSGL-1 determinants that interact with L-selectin. Adhesion studies indicated that O-glycosylation of Thr-57 and sulfation of Tyr-46 and -51 play a critical role in supporting recombinant L-selectin binding to PSGL-1 and leukocyte rolling on PSGL-1. In addition, these determinants were shown to play a major role in stabilizing rolling velocity, a key feature for the regulation of leukocyte exposure to chemotactic stimuli that lead to cell arrest and firm adhesion. By contrast, Tyr-48 played only a minor role in supporting L-selectin-mediated adhesion whereas it was shown to be critical for P-selectin-mediated interactions with PSGL-1 (23Somers W.S. Tang J.

Fukuda (the Burnham Institute, La Jolla Cancer Research Center, San Diego, CA). The cDNA sequence encoding the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of the encephalomyocarditis virus sequence was a gift from P. Aebischer (EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). The pZeoSV and the pcDNA3.1 vectors were from Invitrogen (Groningen, The Netherlands). The IRES sequence was inserted in the multiple cloning sites of the pZeoSV vector (pIRES Zeo SV vector). C2GnT and FucT-VII cDNAs were then subcloned in the pIRES Zeo SV vector to permit the translation of C2GnT and FucT-VII sequences from one mRNA. The expression cassette was constructed by inserting the C2GnT sequence followed by the IRES and the FucT-VII cDNA sequences in the multiple cloning site of the pZeo SV vector. This type of vector allows the expression of the target gene (C2GnT) and the selection marker (sLex expression associated to FucT-VII activity) from the same promoter so that virtually all transfected cells expressing the selection marker also express the gene of interest (40Jackson R.J.

Polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed using PfuPolymerase (Stratagen), and PCR products were cloned into pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen) after digestion of methylated cDNAs withDpnI. Sequences of the constructs were verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Heparinized blood samples were obtained from healthy donors. Lymphocytes were isolated by blood centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque and monocyte depletion by adherence on plastic (43Giuffrè L. Cordey A.-S. Monai N. Tardy Y. Schapira M. Spertini O. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 945-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were isolated from Ficoll-Hypaque pellets by dextran sedimentation and erythrocyte hypotonic lysis. CHO/dhfr− cells (ATCC number: CRL 9096) were stably transfected with cDNAs encoding wild-type or mutant PSGL-1, subcloned in pCDNA3.1 vector. When indicated, CHO cells were co-transfected with FucT-VII cDNA subcloned in pZeoSV vector (Invitrogen) or in the pIRES Zeo SV expression vector, which allows the simultaneous translation of C2GnT and FucT-VII sequences. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE™ Plus (Invitrogen). CHO dhfr− were cultured in MEMα medium containing ribonucleotides, deoxyribonucleotides, and 10% fetal calf serum; COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum. Transfectants were selected in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and, when required, 200 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). Individual clones expressing high levels of the various forms of PSGL-1, C2GnT, and FucT-VII-dependent expression of sLex and the cutaneous lymphocyte antigen (CLA) were isolated by limiting dilutions and identified by immunophenotypic analysis. The expression of PSGL-1, sLex, and CLA was assessed using, respectively, PL2, CSLEX-1, and HECA-452 mAbs. CHO cells, which were selected for adhesion studies, expressed similar levels of PSGL-1 and of sLex/CLA. The expression of C2GnT and FucT-VII mRNAs in CHO cells expressing wild-type or mutant PSGL-1 was detected by RT-PCR using the one tube Titan System™ (Roche Diagnostic, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). Sequences of forward and reverse primers used for C2GnT PCR amplification were GGCAGTGCCTACTTCGTGGTCA and ATGCTCATCCAAACACTGGATGGCAAA; for FucT-VII, CCCACCGTGGCCCAGTACCGCTTCT and CTGACCTCTGTGCCCAGCCTCCCGT; for PSGL-1, ATGCCTCTGCAACTCCTCCT and CTGCTGAATCCGTGGACAGGTT. The expression levels of the various forms of PSGL-1 by CHO cells were determined by the measurement of antigen site density using the DAKO QIFIKIT® (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Antibody binding site density was calculated (44Ting-Beall H.P. Needham D. Hochmuth R.M. Blood. 1993; 81: 2774-2780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using PL2 mAb to assess PSGL-1 expression. PL2 binding sites were found equal to 115 ± 37 (mean ± S.D.) binding sites/μm2 in CHO cells expressing constructs used to perform experiments illustrated in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8. CHO cells used in experiments illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 expressed higher levels of PSGL-1 (247 ± 19 PL2 binding sites/μm2). The determination of sLex and CLA expression indicated that CHO cells used for L-selectin/μ binding studies and adhesion assays expressed comparable levels of FucT-VII activity.Figure 5Role of N-terminal tyrosine sulfate residues in mediating L-selectin/μ binding and neutrophil recruitment on PSGL-1. a, binding of L-selectin/μ to CHO cells stably expressing FucT-VII, C2GnT, and wild-type or mutant PSGL-1 cDNAs.

When required goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC (TagoBIOSOURCE Europe S.A., Nivelles, Belgium), goat anti-mouse IgM-FITC (Tago BIOSOURCE), or rabbit anti-rat IgM-FITC were used as secondary antibodies (Dako). L-selectin/μ and CD4/μ chimeric proteins were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1 mm CaCl2. Cell surface binding of chimeric proteins was detected using a polyclonal FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-human IgM heavy chain antibody (Dako). The specificity of L-selectin/μ binding to PSGL-1 was indicated by the abrogation of L-selectin/μ binding in presence of 5 mm EDTA or 100 μg/ml anti-L-selectin mAb LAM1–3 or 10 μg/ml anti-PSGL-1 mAb KPL1. In experiments performed to evaluate the role of sialic acid residues in supporting neutrophil rolling on PSGL-1, CHO-PSGL-1 cells, co-expressing C2GnT and FucT-VII, were cultured for 30 min at 37 °C in PBS containing 0.1 units/ml Vibrio cholerae neuraminidase (Roche Diagnostics). The reactivity of the mAb CSLEX-1 with sLex was abrogated by this treatment. Flow cytometry was performed with a Epics XL-MCL cytofluorimeter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). A total of 5000 cells were analyzed in each experiment. A laminar flow was generated in a parallel plate flow chamber (GlycoTech Corp Rockville, MD) mounted on a glass coverslip (Polylabo SA, Plan-les-Ouates, Switzerland) covered with a confluent monolayer of transfected CHO cells. Neutrophils suspended in RPMI 1640/1% fetal calf serum at 0.5 × 106/ml, lymphocytes (106/ml), 300.19 pre-B cells stably expressing L-selectin (300.19-L-selectin cells, 0.5 × 106/ml) or K-562 cells cells stably expressing P-selectin (K562 P-selectin cells, 0.5 × 106/ml), were perfused through the chamber using a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Indulab AG, Gams, Switzerland) for 5 min, at room temperature, under a constant shear stress. Leukocyte interactions with CHO cells were visualized using a phase contrast microscope (Leica Leitz DM IL, Renens, Switzerland) and a high resolution Sony CCD-IRIS videocamera (Japan). Images were recorded on an S-VHS-recorder (Panasonic MD 830, Telecom Lausanne, Switzerland). Sequential images of leukocyte interactions with transfected CHO cells were analyzed using a digital image analysis system (Mikado software, GPL SA, Martigny, Switzerland) and a Power-Macintosh 8600/200 workstation equipped with a Scion LG-3 board (Scion, Frederick, MD) (38Xie X. Rivier A.-S. Zakrzewicz A. Bernimoulin M. Zeng X.-L. Wessel H.P. Schapira M. Spertini O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34818-34825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cell-cell interactions were analyzed from videotapes at 2–4 min of perfusion. Leukocyte interactions with CHO cells, in 0.27-mm2 fields, were considered for the analysis when the interaction time was ≥1 s and when the distance traveled by leukocytes during observation periods (20 s) was ≥1 cell diameter. These cells were considered as rolling cells. Experiments were performed in quadruplicates under constant shear stress. Rolling velocities illustrated in Figs. 3 b and 6 were measured in the direction of flow by tracking individual cells every 0.25 s, for up to 4 s, using digitized images. 300–800 independent determinations of cell velocity were measured for each tested condition. Frame-by-frame velocity data obtained by tracking cells every 0.032 s are illustrated in Figs. 7 a and 8 aand were used to assess the mean velocity ± S.D. of each tracked cell over 2–5 s observation periods. The mean velocity of frame-by-frame tracked cells was included between percentile 25–75 of the velocity of each cell population illustrated in Fig. 6. The S.D. value of the mean velocity of each tracked cell was then used to calculate the mean ± S.D. of cell-rolling velocities of each cell population. The mean ± S.D. was used as an indicator of the variation of cell-rolling velocity. 373–1477 independent determinations of frame-by-frame velocity were measured for each tested conditions.

Trypanosomes require lipoproteins in addition to other serum components in order to multiply under axenic culture conditions. Delipidation of the lipoproteins abrogates their capacity to support trypanosome growth. Both major classes of serum lipoproteins, LDL and HDL, are primary sources of lipids, delivering cholesterol esters, cholesterol, and phospholipids to trypanosomes. We show evidence for the existence of a trypanosome lipoprotein scavenger receptor, which facilitates the endocytosis of both native and modified lipoproteins, including HDL and LDL. This lipoprotein scavenger receptor also exhibits selective lipid uptake, whereby the uptake of the lipid components of the lipoprotein exceeds that of the protein components. Trypanosome lytic factor (TLF1), an unusual HDL found in human serum that protects from infection by lysing Trypanosoma brucei brucei, is also bound and endocytosed by this lipoprotein scavenger receptor. HDL and LDL compete for the binding and uptake of TLF1 and thereby attenuate the trypanosome lysis mediated by TLF1. We also show that a mammalian scavenger receptor facilitates lipid uptake from TLF1 in a manner similar to the trypanosome scavenger receptor.

Courtoy P.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 76: 43-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), while there has been no molecular identification of an HDL receptor in bloodstream-form trypanosomes. Trypanosome lytic factors are HDL-related particles found in human plasma. TLF1 contains lipid, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), paraoxonase, and haptoglobin-related protein (Hpr) (18Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), while TLF2 is a lipid-poor molecule that contains apoA-I, Hpr, and IgM (19Raper J. Fung R. Ghiso J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. Inf. Immun. 1999; 67: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both high and low affinity binding sites for TLF1 on trypanosomes have been reported in experiments using purified preparations of TLF1 (20Hager K.M. Pierce M.A. Moore D.R. Tytler E.M. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The low affinity binding site can be competed by HDL whereas the high affinity binding site is partially competed by reconstituted nonlytic HDL containing Hpr (21Drain J. Bishop J.R. Hajduk S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30254-30260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), which led to the proposal that Hpr can mediate TLF1 binding to trypanosomes through a haptoglobin-like receptor. Many lipoprotein receptors have been characterized in eukaryotes, to date only cubilin (22Hammad S.M. Barth J.L. Knaak C. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12003-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and members of the CD36 superfamily of scavenger receptors (23Calvo D. Gomez-Coronado D.

Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar) bind native HDL (without requiring ApoE as a component). The CD36 superfamily of scavenger receptors bind and take up both native HDL and LDL as well as other polyanionic ligands, including oxidized and acetylated LDL (26Krieger M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 793-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Some of these scavenger receptors mediate bi-directional lipid flux and exhibit a process called selective lipid uptake. In polarized cells selective lipid uptake is characterized by receptor-mediated uptake of the lipoprotein, distribution of the lipid within the cell, and recycling of the apolipoprotein to the cell surface (27Silver D.L. Tall A.R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In non-polarized cells there does not appear to be any uptake of the holoparticle, rather binding to the surface of the cell via lipoprotein scavenger receptors facilitates the transfer of lipid from the lipoprotein into cell membranes and intracellular vesicles (28Thuahnai S.T. Lund-Katz S. Williams D.L. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43801-43808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). After lipid transfer, the lipid-depleted particle is released intact from the cell. One of the members of this family, SR-BI (scavenger receptor class BI), mediates the highest level of selective lipid uptake analyzed to date (29Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 274: 41-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 30Gu X. Trigatti B., Xu, S. Acton S. Babitt J. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26338-26348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). While studying trypanosome lytic factors, which are by definition lipoproteins, we decided to revisit lipoprotein receptors. We found evidence that Trypanosoma brucei brucei has a lipoprotein scavenger receptor that mediates the selective uptake of lipid over the protein component of both HDL and LDL. The same receptor can also mediate the uptake of oxidized lipoproteins. TLF1 is also bound and endocytosed by this lipoprotein scavenger receptor. We show that HDL and LDL compete for the binding and uptake of TLF1 and therefore attenuate the trypanosome lysis mediated by TLF1. The fluorescent probes: Alexa Fluor-488, 22-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-23,24-bisnor-5-cholen-3β-ol (NBD-cholesterol), NBD-PtdCho, NBD-PtdEth, 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine percholrate (DiI), and Calcein-AM were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Tissue culture reagents: Ham's F12, DMEM, cell stripper solution, and G418 were obtained from Cellgro. Rhodamine-concanavalin A and Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI were obtained from Vector Labs. Protease inhibitors were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse SR-BI was obtained from Novus Biologicals. [125I]Iodine was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Sephadex G-25 columns were bought from Isolab Inc. Mouse monoclonal anti-human haptoglobin, anti-rabbit IgG-FITC (F-0511), and all other chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. T. b. brucei Etat 1.9s were kindly provided by Dr. Miki Rifkin. CHO ldlA clone 7 and ldlA[mSR-BI] cells were generously provided by Dr. Monty Krieger. Normal human serum, plasma or bovine serum was adjusted to a density of 1.25 g/ml with KBr and ultracentrifuged in a near vertical NVTi 65 rotor (Beckman) for 16 h at 49,000, 10 °C (31Poumay Y. Ronveaux-Dupal M.-F. J. Lipid Res. 1985; 26: 1476-1480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The top 2 ml (ρ = 1.0–1.26 g/ml) were collected and size-fractionated on a Superose 6 16/50 column equilibrated with TBS (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl). Proteins from fractions were separated on a 4–15% Tris-HCl gel and stained with Coomassie Blue. Fractions containing either ApoA-I (HDL) or Apo-B (LDL) were separately pooled and concentrated. Isolation of human HDL and purification of TLF1 from normal human serum (Hp 1-1) was performed as described by Raper et al. (19Raper J. Fung R. Ghiso J. Nussenzweig V. Tomlinson S. Inf. Immun. 1999; 67: 1910-1916Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purified lipoproteins were incubated with Alexa Fluor-488 protein labeling kit (Ex 494, Em 519) according to manufacturers instructions. In order to label lipoprotein lipids, 20 ml of normal human serum were incubated with 50 μl of 1 mg/ml NBD-cholesterol (Abs 469, Em 537) in DMF, NBDC12 PtdCho (Abs 465, Em 534) in Me2SO, or NBD PtdEth (Abs 463, Em 536) in MeOH for 16 h at 37 °C. Lipoproteins were purified according to the above protocol. The specific activity (absorbance/mg of protein) of each fluorophore incorporated into HDL was determined in a 96-well fluorometer (Labsystems Fluoroskan II). Labeling of human HDL with DiI was carried out according to Calvoet al. (24Calvo D. Gomez-Coronado D. Suarez Y. Lasuncion M.A. Vega M.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 777-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, lipoproteins were incubated with the DiI probe in lipoprotein-deficient serum for 12 h at 37 °C, using the following relative amounts: 300 μg DiI, 3 mg of lipoprotein, and 2 ml of lipoprotein-deficient serum. The labeled lipoproteins were subsequently re-isolated by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 2.3 h at 10 °C in a Beckman table top ultracentrifuge (TLA 1.3 rotor). DiI-labeled HDL was then sized on a Superdex HR 200 column (Amersham Biosciences). DiI-labeled TLF1 was obtained by affinity purification of DiI-labeled HDL using a mouse anti-human haptoglobin monoclonal (H-6395,Sigma) coupled to a HiTrap column (Amersham Biosciences). The fractions containing Hpr were pooled and concentrated. Purified TLF1 was radiolabeled by the [125I]ICl technique with 125I to a specific activity of 300–600 dpm/ng. Bound 125I was separated from unbound by gel filtration on a PD10 column. Trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts were >95%. The radiolabeled proteins were used on the day they were labeled. Swiss Webster mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with serum-sensitive T. b. brucei ETat 1.9s, and the trypanosomes were harvested 2 days later from infected mouse blood as described previously (32Lanham S.M. Godfrey D.G. Exp. Parasitol. 1970; 28: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Parasites were resuspended at 2 × 107/ml in Dulbecco's modified medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.2–2% BSA. Increasing concentrations of labeled lipoprotein were incubated at 37 °C for various times with 2 × 107 trypanosomes in DMEM containing 0.2–2% BSA supplemented with the following protease inhibitors: 0.3 mg/ml antipain-HCl, 0.05 mg/ml bestatin, 0.1 mg/ml chymostatin, 0.3 mg/ml E-64, 0.05 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.05 mg/ml pepstatin, 0.3 mg/ml phosphoramidon, 2.0 mg/ml Pefabloc SC, 1.0 mg/ml EDTA, and 0.05 mg/ml aprotinin (miniTab, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were washed twice with bicine-buffered saline with glucose (BBSG), transferred to a black 96-well plate, and lysed in 0.5% SDS. Lysates were read in a Fluoroskan II at the wavelengths for the specific fluorophore. The ligand under study was mixed with competitors at 30–100-fold excess in DMEM/0.2–2% BSA. Then prewarmedT. b. brucei (2 × 107) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. For radioactive ligands, cells were washed three times with DMEM/BSA and transferred to a clean tube prior to quantitating radioactivity in a gamma counter. Fluorescent-labeled cells were washed twice with BBSG, transferred to black 96-well plates, and lysed and read as above. Live trypanosomes were incubated in DMEM/0.2% BSA with either 300 μg/ml of NBD cholesterol/cholesterol ester-labeled plasma HDL or Alexa-labeled plasma HDL, 150 μg/ml of rhodamine-concanavalin A, or 300 μg/ml Alexa-HDL combined with 150 μg/ml rhodamine-concanavalin A at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were washed three times in PBSG and resuspended in 3% paraformaldehyde/PBSG. Cells were washed with PBSG and dried onto 12-well slides (Erie Scientific Co.). DAPI-containing mounting medium was used to adhere coverslips to slides. Slides were viewed on a Nokia fluorescent microscope. To measure lytic activity, 2 × 106 trypanosomes were incubated in the presence of TLF1 (1–1.5 LU (5–40 μg/ml), or TLF1 combined with human LDL (0.75–1 mg/ml) or bovine HDL (1–1.6 mg/ml). LU is the lytic unit wherein 50% of 2 × 106 trypanosomes are lysed in 150 min at 37 0C in a final volume of 200 μl. Following incubation for 150 min at 37 °C, parasite lysis was determined using a previously described calcein fluorescence-based assay (33Tomlinson S. Jansen A.M. Koudinov A. Ghiso J.A. Choi-Miura N.H. Rifkin M.R. Ohtaki S. Nussenzweig V. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). LdlA[mSR-BI] and ldlA7 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine with or without 500 μg/ml G-418, respectively. All cells were maintained in a 37 °C humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator. LdlA[mSR-BI] and parental ldlA7 cells were plated overnight in 6- or 12-well plates washed and incubated for 2–4 h in Ham's medium supplemented with 0.2% BSA. The cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with 2.5 μg/ml DiI-HDL or DiI-TLF1 in Ham's F12 supplemented with 0.2% BSA. Cells were washed twice with PBS, detached from the plate with cell stripper solution and resuspended in PBS, then fixed with an equal volume of 4% paraformaldeyde. For immunofluorescence, LdlA[mSR-BI] and ldlA7 cells were resuspended in 100 μl of Ham's F12, 5% FCS to 106/ml. Anti-SR-BI antibody (100 μl) to a final dilution 1:1000 was added and incubated for 30 min on ice. Cells were then washed three times, resuspended to 100 μl in PBS, 0.1% BSA, and 100 μl of anti-rabbit IgG-FITC-labeled antibody was added to a final dilution of 1:50. After a 30-min incubation on ice, the cells were washed three times with PBS, then resuspended to 100 μl in PBS and fixed with 100 μl of 4% paraformaldehyde. Samples were subjected to flow cytometric analysis using a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. The following excitation/emission were used: 488/525 nm for FITC-conjugated antibody and 488/575 nm for DiI-labeled HDL and TLF1. Mean relative fluorescence of cells was recorded and results are expressed as a percentage of control. We labeled HDL and LDL with Alexa, a fluorophore that conjugates to the free amino groups in the protein components of these lipoproteins. We found that trypanosomes accumulated HDL protein (2.25 pmol, calculated based on a molecular mass of 350,000 Da by size exclusion chromatography, 50% of which is protein) and LDL protein (2 pmol, calculated based on the molecular mass of apoB, 550,000 Da) (Fig. 1 A) with similar kinetics, approximating steady state within 30 min. Trypanosomes also accumulated NBD-cholesterol/cholesterol ester (NBD-C/CE) from HDL (lipid uptake equivalent to 350 pmol of protein) and LDL (lipid uptake equivalent to 425 pmol of protein; Fig. 1 B), approximating steady state within 30 min. TLC analysis indicated that the NBD cholesterol labeled both free cholesterol and cholesterol esters in the lipoproteins (data not shown). Therefore, results shown in Fig. 1 B represent total cholesterol uptake. As HDL and LDL have similar kinetics of protein and lipid uptake (Fig. 1, A and B), they were used in competition assays. The competition was assessed at 30 min, such that the uptake was close to steady state (Fig. 1,A and B). Both unlabeled HDL and LDL were effective competitors of protein (Fig. 1 D) and lipid (Fig. 1 C) uptake from labeled HDL. Fig. 1, panel Dshows that 4 times more HDL than LDL was needed to give a 50% reduction in the uptake of HDL protein. This suggests that the putative lipoprotein receptor has higher affinity for LDL than HDL. Although Fig. 1, panel C displays a similar trend in LDLversus HDL competition, we found that some of the NBD-cholesterol was transferred to the non-labeled lipoprotein, which may contribute to the enhanced competition of lipoprotein lipid uptake. This desorption diffusion process may also occur to some extent when NBD-cholesterol HDL is incubated with trypanosomes. To date the only characterized eukaryotic lipoprotein receptors that bind both native HDL and LDL have the unique characteristic of selective lipid uptake over protein. In light of the above findings we examined if there was a differential uptake of other lipid components over the protein components of HDL. We extended this study to include HDL labeled with fluorescent phospholipids NBD-phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PtdCho), NBD-phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PtdEth) as well as NBD-cholesterol/cholesterol ester (NBD-C/CE). The specific activity (fluorescence/μg of protein) of each fluorescent-labeled HDL was taken into consideration, such that the uptake of each fluorescent lipid was calculated from a standard curve of μg of proteinversus fluorescent units. The results are expressed as microgram of protein equivalents taken up rather than fluorescent units. We found that all classes of lipid molecules in HDL were taken up 50–100-fold more than the protein component (Fig. 2). It is apparent that the uptake of free cholesterol and cholesterol ester exceeds that of phospholipids. In addition NBD-PtdEth was taken up almost 2-fold more than NBD-PtdCho. The uptake of individual lipid species does not correlate with their concentrations found in a typical human HDL, which are 55, 7, and 27 weight% for phosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters respectively (34Shen B.W. Scanu A.M. Kezdy F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 837-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Since all classes of lipid molecules were taken up more avidly than protein, we examined the distribution of the fluorescent lipid and protein molecules by fluorescent microscopy. NBD-cholesterol and cholesterol esters (NBD-C/CE) were rapidly distributed throughout the parasite, and all of the parasites were labeled (Fig. 3 A). Confocal analysis revealed diffuse staining throughout the cytosol of the parasites (data not shown). The labeled phospholipids, NBD-PtdCho and NBD-PtdEth also demonstrated a staining pattern similar to that of NBD-C/CE (data not shown). In contrast, the apolipoprotein (Alexa-HDL) uptake by trypanosomes was visualized in the flagellar pocket and intracellular vesicles (Fig. 3 B) with a distribution similar to endocytosed concanavalin A (ConA) (Fig. 3 C). All of the parasites accumulated detectable Alexa-HDL. Concanavalin A has been shown to distribute within endocytic vesicles of trypanosomes when endocytosed by live trypanosomes (35Morgan G.W. Allen C.L. Jeffries T.R. Hollinshead M. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2605-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Jeffries T.R. Morgan G.W. Field M.C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2617-2626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); in contrast ConA labels the VSG coat when used on fixed trypanosomes presumably due to the exposure of carbohydrate epitopes upon fixation. Coincubation with rhodamine-ConA and Alexa-HDL revealed colocalization in some endocytic vesicles (yellow) near the flagellar pocket but not all endocytic vesicles (red) (Fig. 3 D). All of the data thus far point to the presence of a lipoprotein receptor in trypanosomes that can facilitate the uptake of both native HDL and LDL. TLF1 is a subclass of HDL and is composed of lipids, apolipoprotein A-I, paraoxanase, and haptoglobin-related protein. Lipids and apolipoprotein A-I are the common components of all HDLs, whereas Hpr is unique to TLF particles. There are studies documenting the specific and saturable binding of TLF1 and HDL to the flagellar pocket of African trypanosomes (14Lorenz P. Owen J.S. Hassall D.G. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 74: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 20Hager K.M. Pierce M.A. Moore D.R. Tytler E.M. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We found that TLF1 (20 μg/ml (60 pmol, calculated based on a molecular mass of 550,000 Da by size exclusion chromatography, 60% of which is protein)) and HDL (200 μg/ml (1440 pmol) could compete for binding of 125I-TLF1 to T. b. brucei (Fig. 4). We did not investigate the effect of LDL on the binding of TLF1 to T. b. brucei, because LDL takes 6 h to reach equilibrium binding to trypanosomes whereas HDL and TLF take 30 min. Therefore we could not have a fair competition for binding and evaluated uptake only. Given that we observed competition for binding of TLF1 to trypanosomes by HDL, we evaluated the effect of non-lytic bovine HDL on TLF1-mediated trypanolysis. We observed that non-lytic bovine HDL was able to attenuate trypanosome lysis by purified TLF1 (Fig. 5). Non-lytic human LDL was also effective in attenuating trypanolysis by TLF1. Our results support the presence of a lipoprotein scavenger receptor in trypanosomes that can bind multiple lipoprotein ligands such as TLF1, HDL, LDL, and oxidized LDL (not shown) and exhibit a process called selective lipid uptake similar to eukaryotic lipoprotein scavenger receptors. To directly address whether TLF1 could bind to a eukaryotic lipoprotein scavenger receptor with the same ligand binding characteristics as the trypanosome lipoprotein receptor, we examined the binding of TLF1 to a CHO cell line that overexpresses mouse Scavenger Receptor-Class BI (mSR-BI). The parental CHO ldlA[clone 7] cells do not express the LDL receptor and were stably transfected with a vector expressing mouse scavenger receptor-class BI to create ldlA[mSR-BI] cells (37Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These cell lines were first validated with antibodies raised against mSR-BI; the parental ldlA cells showed little staining, while the transfected ldlA[mSR-BI] cells stained readily with anti-mSR-BI (Fig. 6, inset). HDL labeled with the fluorescent lipid DiI exhibited lipid uptake into cells expressing mSR-BI that was 30-fold greater than the uptake by the parental ldlA cells (Fig. 6). TLF1 labeled in the lipid component with DiI to the same specific activity as DiI-HDL, was taken up to a 5-fold greater extent by cells expressing mSR-BI than that shown by the parental ldlA cells (Fig. 6). Lipoprotein receptors that can bind more than one ligand are known as lipoprotein scavenger receptors. Our results suggest that bloodstream-form trypanosomes have a single lipoprotein scavenger receptor that can facilitate the uptake of all major lipoprotein classes including HDL, LDL, oxidized LDL (results not shown), and TLF1. Moreover, like eukaryotic scavenger receptors, the trypanosome receptor shows selective uptake of lipid over protein from the lipoprotein particle. Trypanosomes are lipid auxotrophs, and host lipoproteins are required for their survival. This putative lipoprotein scavenger receptor may well constitute the primary pathway by which the parasite acquires essential host lipids, and would therefore represent an important therapeutic target. Very few bloodstream-form trypanosome receptors have been previously characterized biochemically. These include an LDL receptor (10Coppens I. Baudhuin P. Opperdoes F.R. Courtoy P.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6753-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and a HDL receptor (13Gillett M.P.T. Owen J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1123: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) both of which may be identical to the scavenger receptor described here (see below), a haptoglobin-like receptor, which may also be a TLF receptor (21Drain J.

https://openalex.org/W1978919002,"Human CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a member of the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors, regulates the activation and directed migration of leukocytes and serves as the main coreceptor for the entry of R5 tropic strains of human immunodeficiency viruses. We have previously shown that RANTES/CCL5 binding to CCR5 induces GPCR kinase (GRK)- and protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation of four distinct C-terminal serine residues. To study these phosphorylation events in vivo, we have generated monoclonal antibodies, which specifically react only with either phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated CCR5. These phosphosite-specific antibodies reveal that following ligand stimulation of the receptor serine 337 is exclusively phosphorylated by a PKC-mediated mechanism, while GRKs phosphorylate serine 349. GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation proceeds in a regular time-dependent manner (t 12 ∼2 min) with an apparent EC50 of 5 nm. In contrast, PKC phosphorylates serine 337 at 50-fold lower concentrations and in a very rapid, albeit transient manner. Protein phosphatases that are active at neutral pH and are inhibited by okadaic acid rapidly dephosphorylate phosphoserine 337, but less efficiently phosphoserine 349, in intact cells and in an in vitro assay. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrates that phosphorylated receptors accumulate in a perinuclear compartment, which resembles recycling endosomes. This study is the first to analyze in detail the spatial and temporal dynamics of GRK- versus PKC-mediated phosphorylation of a G protein-coupled receptor and its subsequent dephosphorylation on the level of individual phosphorylation sites.

The receptors relay the information encoded by the ligand through the activation of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins and intracellular effector molecules. Many GPCR undergo a process of rapid desensitization, which involves ligand-induced phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues located in the third intracellular loop or C-terminal domain by two different families of protein kinases. (i) GPCR kinases (GRKs) specifically phosphorylate only the agonist-occupied GPCR and thus mediate agonist-specific or homologous receptor phosphorylation (3Böhm S.K. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 4Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). (ii) In contrast, the second messenger-activated kinases, such as cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C (PKC), potentially phosphorylate both the ligand-bound GPCR and multiple other receptors in a heterologous manner. Receptor phosphorylation enhances the affinity of the agonist-occupied receptor for interaction with arrestin which interdicts signal transduction between the receptor and G proteins by steric mechanisms. The nonvisual arrestins, β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2, also promote clathrin-mediated endocytosis of phosphorylated receptors and have been implicated in cross-talk with other signaling pathways. Once internalized, GPCR are targeted to recycling or degradative pathways (5Ferguson S.S. Pharmacol. Rev. 2001; 53: 1-24PubMed Google Scholar). Some GPCR are dephosphorylated by membrane-associated G protein-coupled receptor phosphatases and recycled rapidly to the plasma membrane where they can again respond to agonists while other receptors appear to be retained within the cell. Although reversible receptor phosphorylation is a well recognized mechanism that plays important roles in multiple aspects of GPCR signaling, with few exceptions the exact sites of second messenger kinase- and GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation have not been identified. Most insights into receptor phosphorylation derive fromin vitro assays with purified proteins in reconstituted systems or from mutagenesis studies with elimination of the presumed consensus sites for receptor phosphorylation under experimental conditions of protein overexpression. Results obtained by these various methods can sometimes prove misleading, as illustrated by studies with the β2-adrenergic receptor (6Hausdorff W.P. Campbell P.T. Ostrowski J., Yu, S.S. Caron M.G.

The observed discrepancies in the outcome of these studies are probably explained by unspecific effects of receptor mutagenesis and by the poor substrate specificity of receptor kinases in reconstituted systems. Furthermore, very little is known about the different kinetics and intracellular localization of agonist-induced GPCR phosphorylation, which is mediated by second messenger-dependent kinases versusGRKs at normal levels of protein expression. In the present study we have taken a new approach to the analysis of receptor phosphorylation in intact cells. By using phosphosite-specific monoclonal antibodies we determined with high temporal and spatial resolution the ligand-induced phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CC chemokine receptor CCR5 at two separate phosphorylation sites. This receptor is well suited as a model protein for this kind of analysis since its function as cofactor for the entry of R5 tropic strains of human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV) has stimulated detailed investigations into the mechanisms that regulate CCR5 signaling and cell surface expression in recent years. In particular, this receptor was shown to be a potential substrate for all major GRK isoforms (9Aramori I. Zhang J. Ferguson S.S. Bieniasz P.D. Cullen B.R. Caron M.G.

Two-dimensional phosphoamino acid analysis in combination with site-directed mutagenesis identified four serine residues that are located in the CCR5 C terminus as the only potential phosphorylation sites on this receptor (10Oppermann M.

It was previously unknown whether phosphorylation of different serine residues can be attributed to particular kinases or whether they compete for the same phosphoacceptor sites. The current report demonstrates that agonist-induced CCR5 phosphorylation at two distinct sites proceeds with different kinetics and characteristic intracellular distribution in a dynamic manner that involves different protein kinases and phosphatases.

Human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were seeded at a density of 3 × 105 cells per 600-mm dish and transfected using LipofectAMINE with pEF-BOS expression vectors (1.5 μg/dish), which encode various CCR5 Ser/Ala mutants (10Oppermann M.

Transfection efficiencies as determined by flow cytometry with an anti-CCR5 mAb (Q10/19) ranged between 43 and 68%. A phosphopeptide (CEAPERA(pS)(pS)VYTR(pS)TGEQI(pS)VGL) corresponding to the 22 C-terminal amino acid residues of human CCR5 with phosphoserine (highlighted in boldface type) incorporated at the four known phosphorylation sites as well as a nonphosphorylated version of the same peptide were synthesized by standard solid phase methods. The peptides were purified to >70% purity by reversed phase HPLC and displayed the correct mass spectrum. The peptides were conjugated via the N-terminal cysteine residues to bovine serum albumin using succinimidyl 4-(N-maleimidomethyl)cyclohexane-1-carboxylate (SMCC) and BALB/c mice were immunized at four monthly intervals with peptide-BSA conjugates (75 μg per animal and injection). Monoclonal antibodies were generated according to standard techniques by the fusion of spleen cells with X63-Ag8.653 myeloma cells and were identified initially by differential ELISA reactivities toward phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated receptor peptides. Polyclonal phosphopeptide-specific antisera directed against a putative tyrosine phosphorylation site within a highly conserved Asp-Arg-Tyr sequence at the end of the third transmembrane domain of CCR5 (15Rodriguez-Frade J.M.

IgG was purified using protein A chromatography, and antibodies reactive with the corresponding nonphosphorylated receptor sequence were removed by adsorption to a nonphosphopeptide affinity column. Two murine mAb (R22/7 and T21/8; both IgG1/κ) which bind with high affinity to a CCR5 N-terminal epitope were generated following the immunization of mice with intact RBL-CCR5 cells (10Oppermann M.

RBL-2H3 cells which express wild-type or phosphorylation-deficient CCR5 (7 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish) were stimulated with varying concentrations of RANTES for 10 min at 37 °C, washed once with PBS, and solubilized in detergent buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.05% SDS with phosphatase and protease inhibitors as described, Ref. 16Oppermann M.

Experiments that focused on the detection of tyrosine phosphorylation were performed in the presence of 10 μm sodium orthovanadate. Receptors were immunoprecipitated by the incubation (2 h/4 °C) of cellular lysates with 20 μg of anti-CCR5 R22/7 and protein G-Sepharose. Receptors were eluted by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in SDS sample buffer containing 2% SDS and 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Immunoblots were performed using monoclonal anti-pS337 V14/2 (5 μg/ml), anti-pTyr PY20 (0.1 μg/ml), or polyclonal anti-pY127 (10 μg/ml) antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20/5% nonfat dry milk. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection of antigens was achieved with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Afterward membranes were stripped and reprobed for total cellular receptors with anti-CCR5 mAb R22/7 (10 μg/ml). The agonist-induced phosphorylation of CCR5 was determined in RBL-CCR5 cells grown to confluency in 24-well dishes, which were stimulated for various incubation times with the indicated concentrations of RANTES or PMA in 80:20–10 medium. The cells were transferred to ice and scraped in 200 μl of lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 × g for 10 min and supernatants (100 μl) were applied either directly or after 2-fold dilution in lysis buffer into wells of microtiter plates, which were adsorbed with anti-CCR5 mAb T21/8 (5 μg/ml in 50 mmcarbonate, pH 10.6) as the capture antibody. The same cellular lysates were probed, in parallel, with several biotinylated mAb (anti-pS349 E11/19; anti-pS337 V14/2; anti-S337 R-C10; 1 μg/ml in PBS, 0.05% Tween 20), which react with distinct phosphorylation states and sites on the CCR5 C terminus. After a 2-h incubation period (non-)phosphorylated CCR5 were detected by adding a 4000-fold dilution of streptavidin peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) in PBS/Tween for 1 h and 2.2-azino-di-(3-ethyl-benzthiazoline sulfonate) as substrate. Incubation periods were terminated by 3 wash cycles with PBS/Tween, respectively. The assays were calibrated with a standard protein, which was obtained by the conjugation of bovine serum albumin with synthetic N-terminal and non-/phosphorylated C-terminal CCR5 peptides at 1:5:5 molar ratios using SMCC as a cross-linking reagent. Results were expressed in arbitrary units (1 AU equals 1 ng of BSA-peptide per ml). RBL-CCR5 cells were incubated with 30 nm RANTES (10 min) and 200 nmPMA (5 min) to induce maximal receptor phosphorylation. Cells were scraped in lysis buffer and filled directly into wells of ELISA plates, which were precoated with anti-CCR5 mAb T21/8. Receptors bound to the solid phase were incubated for up to 1 h at 37 °C with potato acid phosphatase (0.6 units/ml in 40 mm PIPES, 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.0 with protease inhibitors). Alternatively, RBL-2H3 cells were scraped in 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm2-mercaptoethanol with protease inhibitors and homogenized by sonication (four 10-s bursts at 100 watts). Nuclei were removed by centrifugation (10 min; 300 × g) and the supernatant was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with receptors bound to the ELISA plate in the presence or absence of 200 nm okadaic acid. RBL-CCR5 cells were grown overnight on glass coverslips in 24-well plates. Cells were washed once in warm 80:20-10 medium and then treated with 25 nm RANTES in medium for varying time intervals at 37 °C. Thereafter, the coverslips were placed on ice, washed with cold medium, and fixed with an ice-cold solution of 3% paraformaldehyde, pH 7.4 in PBS for 20 min. Free aldehyde groups were quenched with 50 mmNH4Cl in PBS for 30 min. After permeabilization with cold PBS containing 0.05% saponin and 0.2% gelatin for 15 min, cells were washed with the same buffer and stained with anti-CCR5 (T21/8), anti-pS337 (V14/2), or anti-pS349 (E11/19) antibodies (5 μg/ml in PBS/saponin) for 1 h on ice. After washing with PBS/saponin/gelatin, secondary antibody staining was carried out with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:100 dilution) for 1 h. After further washes in PBS, coverslips were mounted in Mowiol containing 0.1% p-phenylenediamine. The samples were analyzed by confocal laser-scanning microscopy utilizing a Leica TCS SP2 system, images were assembled in Corel Draw. Synthetic (phospho-)peptides that encompass the four C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites of CCR5 were used to generate monoclonal antibodies which differentially bind either to phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated versions of the immunogenic peptides. Two hybridomas (E11/19, IgG1/κ; V14/2, IgG1/κ) were identified, which selectively react only with ligand-activated CCR5 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner as shown by several independent immunological techniques. Another mAb (R-C10, IgG1/κ) was derived from a separate fusion after immunization with a nonphosphorylated C-terminal receptor peptide which exclusively recognizes non-activated CCR5. The immunoblot shown in Fig. 1 demonstrates that the pCCR5-specific mAb V14/2 reacts with CCR5, which migrates as a broad 40-kDa protein in SDS-PAGE analysis typical of a glycosylated G protein-coupled receptor, but only in its ligand-activated, i.e. phosphorylated form. Under the experimental conditions used in this study we did not observe higher molecular weight forms of CCR5. Despite RANTES activation this mAb did not recognize a phosphorylation-deficient CCR5 mutant, which was generated by alanine replacement of all four C-terminal serine phosphorylation sites. Similar results were obtained with the mAb E11/19, whereas the mAb R-C10 displayed reverse reactivity and lost its ability to react with CCR5 upon ligand activation in a dose-dependent manner. It has been proposed that chemokine binding to their receptors exposes the tyrosine residue within the highly conserved Asp-Arg-Tyr motif in the second intracellular receptor loop which is then rapidly phosphorylated by Janus kinases (JAKs) (15Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Vila-Coro A.J. Martin A. Nieto M. Sanchez-Madrid F. Proudfoot A.E. Wells T.N. Martinez A. Mellado M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 755-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Rodriguez-Frade J.M. Mellado M. Martinez C. Trends Immunol. 2001; 22: 612-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We tested this hypothesis by generating phosphopeptide-specific antibodies, which specifically recognize phospho-Tyr-127 and probed the ligand-activated CCR5 with this and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, in parallel, by immunoblotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We did not observe phosphorylation of either this specific or any other tyrosine residue of this receptor after incubation of RBL-CCR5 cells with saturating concentrations of RANTES (30 nm) within a time frame of 30 s up to 20 min (Fig. 2). To exactly map the epitopes that are recognized by the various phospho-CCR5-specific mAb we determined ELISA reactivities of RBL cellular lysates containing maximally phosphorylated CCR5 Ser/Ala mutants (Fig. 3). Substitution of serine 337 by alanine either alone or in combination with any other mutation resulted in the complete loss of V14/2 binding to the receptor, whereas the mutation of serine 349 eliminated E11/19 reactivity. This indicates that V14/2 and E11/19 recognize phosphoserines at positions 337 and 349, respectively, and independent of the phosphorylation state of any of the other three serine residues. Using the same cellular lysates in the absence of receptor activation we found that the mAb R-C10 exclusively reacts with nonphosphorylated serine 337 (not shown). Epitope mapping with monophosphorylated CCR5 peptides independently confirmed these results. Exposure to CC-chemokines produces a rapid increase in CCR5 phosphorylation, which is mediated by protein kinases belonging to the PKC and GRK families. We tested the hypothesis that both protein kinases phosphorylate distinct CCR5 C-terminal serine residues. To this end ELISA procedures were established that are based on a capture antibody with specificity for a CCR5 N-terminal epitope and different (non)phospho-CCR5-specific detecting antibodies. These assays enabled us to determine, in parallel, the phosphorylation status of serine residues at positions 337 and 349 after stimulation of CCR5-expressing cells with various agonists. Stimulation with PMA caused maximal phosphorylation at serine 337 and pretreatment with bisindolylmaleimide I, a selective and potent inhibitor of classical and novel PKC isoforms, completely prevented phorbol ester- and ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 4). In contrast, in the same experiment neither the PMA-induced activation nor the inhibition of PKC by bisindolylmaleimide in cells that were exposed to receptor-saturating concentrations (30 nm) of RANTES had any noticeable effect on the phosphorylation state of serine 349. Several other protein kinase inhibitors, including the protein kinase A inhibitor H-89 (5 μm), the calmodulin kinase inhibitor KN-93 (10 μm), the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (200 nm), or the broad spectrum protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine (500 nm) also did not inhibit the chemokine-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser-349. Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin for 16 h at a concentration (100 ng/ml) known to disrupt G protein-mediated signaling in RBL-CCR5 cells (11Kraft K. Olbrich H. Majoul I. Mack M. Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) abrogated RANTES-induced phosphorylation at serine 337 but, again, had no effect on phosphorylation of serine 349. Previous studies that employed receptor mutants (18Hausdorff W.P. Bouvier M. O'Dowd B.F. Irons G.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12657-12665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or various kinase inhibitors (19Roth N.S. Campbell P.T. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24247-24254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that second messenger-dependent kinases and GRKs differently contribute to GPCR phosphorylation upon exposure to different agonist concentrations and at different time intervals. Phosphosite-specific mAb now allowed us to monitor the kinetics and dose-dependence of the RANTES-induced phosphorylation of non-mutated CCR5 by different protein kinases under close to physiological conditions. When RBL-CCR5 cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of agonist for various time intervals half-maximal phosphorylation of Ser-349 was observed at 5 nm RANTES and ∼4-fold higher concentrations were required to achieve maximal phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). The concentration dependence of RANTES-induced phosphorylation paralleled ligand binding to the receptor (11Kraft K. Olbrich H. Majoul I. Mack M. Proudfoot A. Oppermann M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34408-34418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and thus conformed to the characteristics of a GRK-mediated mechanism. In contrast, phosphorylation of Ser-337 by the second messenger-activated kinase (PKC) was detected at 50-fold lower concentrations when cells were exposed to agonist for 1 min (Fig. 5 A). This indicates significant signal amplification downstream of the receptor under these experimental conditions. Unexpectedly, the dose dependence of this effect shifted to higher concentrations when cells were exposed to RANTES for longer incubation times. A detailed kinetic analysis revealed that stimulation with low RANTES concentrations results in the phosphorylation of Ser-337 in a very rapid, albeit transient manner (Fig. 5 C). Maximal CCR5 phosphorylation at this site was obtained by stimulation for 40 s, and thereafter the receptor was rapidly dephosphorylated. In the presence of receptor-saturating concentrations of ligand dephosphorylation of phospho-Ser-337 was significantly retarded. When lysates of RBL-CCR5 cells that had been stimulated with 0.5 nm RANTES for various times were probed with a mAb (R-C10), which specifically recognizes only nonphosphorylated Ser-337 the results represented a mirror image of the values obtained with anti-phospho-Ser-337 mAb V14/2 (Fig. 6 A). This experiment shows that stimulation of only a small fraction of the cellular complement of CCR5 with low concentrations of RANTES is capable of causing the transient phosphorylation of ∼50% of all receptors in a heterologous manner. A strikingly different time course of Ser-337 phosphorylation was observed after incubation of cells with 50 nm PMA. Phosphorylation was irreversible within the time frame of this experiment and did not peak until after 5 min (Fig. 6 B). Phosphorylation of substrates by serine/threonine protein kinases often requires phosphorylation of a nearby priming site by another protein kinase (21Fiol C.J. Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y. Roeske R.W.

Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 8Hall A.V. Antoniou H. Wang Y. Cheung A.H. Arbus A.M. Olson S.L., Lu, W.C. Kau C.L. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The translational initiation and termination sites are located in exons 2 and 29, respectively. Given the relevance of nNOS in diverse biological systems, its complex spatial and temporal expression patterns, and the important consequences of altered expression, a tightly controlled regulatory network appears to be critical.We recently reported that multiple distinct examples of exon 1 are selectively utilized in a tissue-specific manner (6Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H. Hall A.V. VanDamme S. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12150-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These exon 1 variants, arising from alternative promoters of a single gene, are distributed over a region >105 kb and are designated exons 1a, 1b, 1c, etc. Multiple variants of exon 1 are evident in both mouse and rat, indicating that nNOS mRNA diversity at the 5′-end is evolutionarily conserved across species (9Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R., Wu, Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1433) Google Scholar). In addition, a novel promoter was described for murine nNOS. It is located within exon 2, further increasing the promoter diversity of this gene (10Sasaki M. Gonzalez-Zulueta M. Huang H. Herring W.J. Ahn S. Ginty D.D. Dawson V.L. Dawson T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8617-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Overall, this nNOS mRNA diversity involves the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) and does not affect the encoded protein sequence, but has been shown to affect the translational efficiency of the gene (6Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H. Hall A.V. VanDamme S. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12150-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In contrast, a downstream promoter within intron 3 of the human nNOS gene produces a Leydig cell-specific mRNA transcript that encodes an N-terminally deleted nNOS protein (11Wang Y. Newton D.C.

Nitric Oxide. 1998; 2: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For instance, cassette exon deletion and insertion events have been reported to occur within the open reading frame (ORF) of human nNOS (8Hall A.V. Antoniou H. Wang Y. Cheung A.H. Arbus A.M.

Distinct roles for some of these variants have been reported, including changes in the response to morphine (14Kolesnikov Y.A. Pan Y.X. Babey A.M. Jain S. Wilson R. Pasternak G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11204-11208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Increased expression of specific nNOS splice variants has been reported within the spinal cord of patients affected by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, which may contribute to the pathophysiology of this disease (17Catania M.V. Aronica E. Yankaya B. Troost D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC148Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dissecting the various mechanisms of splicing regulation and the role of the nNOS splice variants will be clearly important in understanding the contribution of this complex gene to disease processes.Alternative splicing events that exclusively involve the 5′-UTR of a mammalian mRNA are distinctly uncommon. Alterations to this region of the mRNA have the potential to introduce post-transcriptional regulatory elements. Several mechanisms of translational control by the 5′-UTR have been proposed. These include, but are not limited to, the primary structure of the mRNA affecting translational initiation (e.g. upstream AUG codons affecting ribosome scanning), the secondary or tertiary structures modulating translational machinery (e.g. stem-loops and pseudoknots), and RNA-binding proteins (e.g. iron-responsive element (IRE)-binding protein (IRP)), among others (18Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 19Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell.

Enzyme ( Basel ). 1990; 44: 68-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In many of these examples, the translational regulation mediated by the 5′-UTR plays a key role in tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of the involved gene (22Fu L.N., Ye, R.Q.

An alternative splicing event contributing a translational control element within a 5′-UTR would represent a newer model for the control of mammalian gene expression. Herein, we describe, characterize, and quantify such a splicing event in the human nNOS gene. Importantly, we demonstrate that an alternative splicing event affecting the 5′-UTR modifies the translational efficiency of select nNOS mRNAs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA and Genomic CharacterizationModifications of the rapid amplification of 5′-cDNA ends (5′-RACE) protocol were utilized to isolate the 5′ termini of mRNA transcripts for human nNOS from total cellular RNA samples (12Wang Y. Goligorsky M.S. Lin M. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, total cellular RNA (1 μg) derived from various normal human tissues was reverse-transcribed with a gene-specific antisense primer in exon 2 (5′-CCA TGG TAA CTA GCT TCC-3′), and two rounds of PCR was performed as described (6Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H. Hall A.V. VanDamme S. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). PCR products were digested withEcoRI/XbaI, subcloned into pBluescript, and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. This approach allowed the characterization of cDNA sequences upstream of exon 2 in various human tissues. To characterize human genomic sequences corresponding to cDNA sequences upstream of exon 2, P1 clones were isolated by PCR-based screening from a library of human diploid genomic DNA as described (6Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H. Hall A.V. VanDamme S. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12150-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Three overlapping P1 clones were isolated, partially digested with Sau3AI, subcloned into the BamHI site of pBluescript SK(−), and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Exonic sequences and exon-intron boundaries corresponding to the alternatively spliced (AS) exon were determined on both strands of genomic DNA with an ABI PRISM 377 automated DNA sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences).Quantification of AS Exon-containing mRNA TranscriptsRNase Protection Assay (RPA)RPA was used to quantitate and structurally characterize the tissue-specific expression of the AS exon. A 274-nucleotide (nt) PCR fragment containing the 89-nt AS exon and 185 nt of exon 2 was subcloned into the pCRII vector (TA cloning kit, Invitrogen). The full-length 382-nt [α-32P]CTP-labeled antisense riboprobe was generated using the T7 MAXIscript kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX). 105cpm of gel-purified probe was hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C with 25 μg of total cellular RNA. Multiple independent samples of human skeletal muscle RNA were extracted using guanidinium-based protocols from tissue procured from the National Disease Research Interchange (Philadelphia), and all other RNAs were obtained commercially (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). RPA was performed using the RPA IIITM kit (Ambion Inc.) and sized using CENTURYTM RNA markers (Ambion Inc.).Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Southern AnalysisSemiquantitative RT-PCR was utilized to assess the tissue-specific expression of the AS exon and the relationship between the presence of the AS exon and promoter utilization. First-strand cDNA was synthesized with total cellular RNA (5 μg) derived from various normal human tissues (Clontech) using random primers and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The following sense primers were used: exon 1a (5′-CAT TCT GGA ATC CCA TGC TC-3′), long exon 1c (5′-TTG TCT CTC CCA GGG AAG-3′), short exon 1c (5′-CCA CCA TGC CAG GGT GAG G-3′), exon 1g (5′-GCA GCG CGA AGA GGC AGC-3′), exon 1j (5′-GCA AAG TGC TGC GTC ACT CT-3′), and AS exon (5′-GTT GCC AGT GCA GCC ATC T-3′), with a common antisense primer in exon 2 (5′-GGA AGT GAT GGT TGA CCA GG-3′). The amplification of exon 22/exon 23 was performed using 5′-CAC CAT CTT CCA GGC CTT-3′ and 5′-CGG TAG GAA ACG ATG GCC-3′. PCR amplifications were performed under well characterized semiquantitative conditions in a total volume of 100 μl for 30 cycles as described (6Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H. Hall A.V. VanDamme S. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12150-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The quantity of the first-strand template used in each reaction was adjusted to reflect glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase levels, which were determined using real-time PCR. Products were size-fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis and downward-transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes (DuPont). Southern blots were hybridized with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled oligonucleotides positioned internally to flanking PCR primers. Human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels were assessed as a quantitative control (sense, 5′-GAA GGT GAA GGT CGG AGT C-3′; and antisense, 5′-GAA GAT GGT GAT GGG ATT TC-3′) by real-time PCR using the ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). The TaqMan probe (5′-CAA GCT TCC CGT TCT CAG CC-3′) was 5′-labeled with VIC and 3′-labeled with tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA). Reactions were performed in triplicate.Functional Analysis of the AS Exon upon Translation of a Downstream Reporter ORFGeneration of Exon 1/AS Exon Reporter ConstructsA series of in vitro expression vectors were constructed using a modified pSP-Luc+ plasmid (Promega) that included a sequence of 60 adenylate residues 3′ of the luciferase ORF. Reporter constructs either included or excluded the 89-nt AS exon between exons 1 and 2 and were generated using native restriction sites and 5′-RACE clones. AS exon-containing reporters were produced for the major exons 1a, 1c, 1f, and 1g. Each reporter contained sequences of previously reported representative cDNA variants with 100, 326, 276, and 161 nt of the exon 1, respectively (GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers AF049712,AF049714, AF049717, AF049718) (6Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H. Hall A.V. VanDamme S. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12150-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Modified Exon 1c/AS Exon Reporter ConstructsThe effects of various transcriptional start sites on the repression mediated by the AS exon were tested using modified versions of the exon 1c/pSP-Luc reporter. A PCR-based approach was used with VentDNA polymerase (New England Biolabs Inc.) and three specific sense primers. To generate reporters containing 101, 66, and 31 nt of exon 1c sequence, the following primers were designed: 5′-CGG GGT ACC ACG CCA GGC GGC TGA TTA-3′, 5′-CGG GGT ACC AGA TGG GGA GCA CTG TCT GA-3′, and 5′-CGG GGT ACC ACC ATG CCA GGG TGA GGC-3′, respectively, and a common antisense primer, 5′-GCC TTT CTT TAT GTT TTT GG-3′. PCR was performed on existing templates either containing or lacking the AS exon. PCR amplicons were digested with KpnI/NcoI and subcloned into the exon 1c/pSP-Luc reporter prepared similarly.Mutational Analysis of the Stem-Loop Structure Located within the AS ExonMutations within the AS exon stem-loop structure were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The following sense/antisense overlapping primers were used: S1, 5′-GAG GCC TTG CCG GAA ATG GTT GCC AGT GCA C-3′/5′-GTG CAC TGG CAA CCA TTT CCG GCA AGG CCT C-3′; S2, 5′-GGT GAG GCC TTG CCG GAT GGT TGC CAG TGC AGC-3′/5′-GCT GCA CTG GCA ACC ATC CGG CAA GGC CTC ACC-3′; S3, 5′-CCA TGC CAG GGT GAG GCC TTG CCG GAG CCA GTG CAG CCA TCT GAA TTC C-3′/5′-GGA ATT CAG ATG GCT GCA CTG GCT CCG GCA AGG CCT CAC CCT GGC ATG G-3′; and L1, 5′-GCC TTG CCG GAG CTG GTT GCA CAA GCA GCC ATC TGA ATT CC-3′/5′-GGA ATT CAG ATG GCT GCT TGT GCA ACC AGC TCC GGC AAG GC-3′. Amplifications were performed using the existing exon 1c/AS exon (31 nt)/pSP-Luc luciferase reporter as the template. For all described reporter constructs, the subcloned regions and subsequent mutations were confirmed using fluorescence-based DNA sequencing as described above.RNA TransfectionsPC12 cells (rat pheochromocytoma, nNOS(+); American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in RPMI 16 40 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and antibiotics (Invitrogen). C2C12 cells (mouse skeletal myoblast, nNOS(+); American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. HeLa cells (human adenocarcinoma, nNOS(−); American Type Culture Collection) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. In vitro transcription of capped RNA was carried out using the Sp6 mMessageMachine kit (Ambion Inc.). The quality of in vitro synthesized,7mGpppG-capped RNA was assessed on 0.66 mformaldehyde-containing 1% agarose gels. Cells were maintained in 60-mm dishes and transfected at 50–70% confluency with in vitro synthesized, quantified, capped RNA using Lipofectin (Invitrogen). 3 μg of RNA and 12 μl of Lipofectin were used for each 60-mm dish along with 5 μg of β-galactosidase RNA to control for transfection efficiency. Cellular extract was harvested 4–6 h after RNA transfection, at which time reporter activity was increasing linearly as a function of time (6Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L.

Multiple independent RNA preparations were used. Northern blot analysis using total cellular RNA harvested 4–6 h post-transfection and a random primer-labeled luciferase DNA probe was carried out to assess steady-state levels of transfected reporter RNA molecules. Luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer (Monolight 2010C, Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San Diego, CA) and normalized for β-galactosidase activity and protein content as described (6Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H. Hall A.V. VanDamme S. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12150-12155Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar).Functional Analysis of the AS Exon upon Translation of the nNOS ORFpcDNA3 (Invitrogen)-based vectors were used to stably integrate the full-length nNOS cDNA downstream of native 5′-UTR sequences. PCR-generated fragments containing the exon 1 variants containing or lacking the AS exon were subcloned into the native nNOSXbaI site within exon 2 (upstream of the human nNOS ORF). CHO-K1 cells (American Type Culture Collection) grown in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) were transfected with the various pcDNA constructs containing either exon 1a or 1c, each with or without the AS exon upstream of the full-length nNOS ORF, as described (12Wang Y. Goligorsky M.S. Lin M. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The mutations of the AS exon were also inserted into the exon 1c/AS exon (31 nt)/pcDNA-based nNOS expression vector using existing restriction sites. For all constructs described, the subcloned regions were confirmed using fluorescence-based DNA sequencing as described above. Three independent pools of G418-resistant clones, each representing >300 independent clones, were selected and maintained in 800 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). nNOS protein levels were assessed as described (12Wang Y. Goligorsky M.S. Lin M. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, a monoclonal anti-human nNOS antibody, raised against an epitope located within the C terminus (amino acids 1095–1289) of the nNOS protein (BD Biosciences), was used with a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Detection was facilitated using the Supersignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce) and the Fluor-S Max Multimager (Model 170-7720, Bio-Rad). Densitometric analysis was performed using QuantityOne and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Steady-state nNOS mRNA levels were determined by RPA as described above using a 444-nt probe that protected a 369-nt nNOS fragment corresponding to nNOS exons 16 and 17. To control for insertional copy number of the nNOS-containing pcDNA construct, we measured the levels of neomycin transcripts using a 151-nt probe complementary to 120 nt of the neomycin phosphotransferase ORF.Mapping the Exon 1c Transcriptional Start SitePrimer Extension AnalysisAn oligonucleotide (5′-GAG GCA TCA TGA GCA GCT CCG GCA AGG-3′) complementary to the junction of exons 1c and 2 was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity of 6000 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). 8.0 × 104 cpm of labeled primer was hybridized to 25 μg of total cellular RNA for 16 h at 25 °C. Human total cellular RNA from cerebellum and skeletal muscle was extracted using guanidinium-based protocols from tissues procured from the National Disease Research Interchange. Reverse transcription was carried out using Superscript II. Primer extension products were sized using a35S-labeled dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing ladder as described (8Hall A.V. Antoniou H. Wang Y. Cheung A.H. Arbus A.M. Olson S.L., Lu, W.C. Kau C.L. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RPAA uniformly [α-32P]CTP-labeled antisense riboprobe was synthesized using an existing 5′-RACE genomic clone. Linearization at an internal StyI site resulted in a 318-nt probe complementary to 200 nt of exon 1c and 91 nt of exon 2. 105 cpm of PAGE-purified probe was hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C with yeast tRNA (50 μg) (data not shown) or human total cellular RNA (50 μg) (Clontech). RNase protection was as described (8Hall A.V. Antoniou H. Wang Y. Cheung A.H. Arbus A.M. Olson S.L., Lu, W.C. Kau C.L. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33082-33090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).RNA Electrophoretic Mobility Shift AssayPCR was used to generate the riboprobe templates. The following sense primers were designed containing a T7 promoter sequence: wild-type, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA CGG AGC TGG TTG CCA G-3′; and S3, 5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG GGA CGG AGC CAG TGC AGC C-3′. All reactions were performed with the common antisense primer 5′-GAC GTG TCC TAA GGT CAG-3′, and the existing wild-type or mutant exon 1c/AS exon/luciferase reporters were used as templates. PCR products were ligated using the TA cloning kit into the pCRII vector. [α-32P]CTP (specific activity of 800 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) probes were synthesized using the T7 MAXIscript kit and PAGE-purified. Cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared from C2C12, PC12, and CHO-K1 cell monolayers in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, 10 mm KCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40, pH 7.4) containing CompleteTM EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The supernatant was collected following centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 1 min. 4.0 × 104 cpm of riboprobe was incubated with cytoplasmic protein extract (30 μg) at 4 °C for 30 min. Binding reactions were resolved using nondenaturing (1× Tris borate/EDTA) 6% polyacrylamide gel and analyzed using a PhosphorImager with ImageQuant software (Version 1.2).Data AnalysisAll experiments were performed at least three times. Unless otherwise indicated, quantitative data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each done in triplicate. Comparisons were performed using analysis of variance, and statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05.DISCUSSIONWe have reported the existence of an alternatively spliced exon within the 5′-UTR of the human nNOS mRNA. The finding of an exon insertion/deletion event within a 5′-UTR that does not affect the ORF is a rare event, especially in mammals. Insertion of the AS exon occurs upstream of the authentic translational initiation codon for nNOS; and as predicted, we have demonstrated that it leaves the nNOS ORF unaltered. Reports of other mammalian mRNAs containing an alternatively spliced, independent exon solely within the 5′-UTR are sparse, but include the connexin-32, nuclear respiratory factor-1, and ganglioside (M3) synthase genes (35Kim K.W. Kim S.W. Min K.S. Kim C.H. Lee Y.C. Gene ( Amst. ). 2001; 273: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 36Huo L. Scarpulla R.C.

Biochem. 1999; 259: 188-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of these splicing events has not yet been addressed. In this work, we found that the AS exon markedly repressed the translation of the human nNOS ORF and a heterologous ORF. Our findings emphasize the many facets of control that are operative in gene expression by providing a newer model of 5′-UTR-mediated regulation of translational efficiency.In considering nNOS expression, a mode of translational regulation is fitting given that the human gene spans 240 kb and is therefore predicted to be kinetically inefficient with respect to transcriptional initiation and elongation, requiring 1.6–2.5 h at 100–150 kb/h (38Tennyson C.N. Klamut H.J. Worton R.G. Nat. Genet. 1995; 9: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability to modify the translational competency of existing nNOS mRNAs represents an efficient mechanism"
https://openalex.org/W2064513969,"We have shown here that the apoptosis inducer staurosporine causes an early decrease in the endogenous respiration rate in intact 143B.TK<sup>−</sup> cells. On the other hand, the activity of cytochrome <i>c</i> oxidase is unchanged for the first 8 h after staurosporine treatment, as determined by oxygen consumption measurements in intact cells. The decrease in the endogenous respiration rate precedes the release of cytochrome<i>c</i> from mitochondria. Moreover, we have ruled out caspases, permeability transition, and protein kinase C inhibition as being responsible for the decrease in respiration rate. Furthermore, overexpression of the gene for Bcl-2 does not prevent the decrease in respiration rate. The last finding suggests that Bcl-2 acts downstream of the perturbation in respiration. The evidence of normal enzymatic activities of complex I and complex III in staurosporine-treated 143B.TK<sup>−</sup> osteosarcoma cells indicates that the cause of the respiration decrease is probably an alteration in the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. Presumably, the voltage-dependent anion channel closes, thereby preventing ADP and oxidizable substrates from being taken up into mitochondria. This interpretation was confirmed by another surprising finding, namely that, in staurosporine-treated 143B.TK<sup>−</sup> cells permeabilized with digitonin at a concentration not affecting the mitochondrial membranes in naive cells, the outer mitochondrial membrane loses its integrity; this leads to a reversal of its impermeability to exogenous substrates. The loss of outer membrane integrity leads also to a massive premature release of cytochrome<i>c</i> from mitochondria. Most significantly, Bcl-2 overexpression prevents the staurosporine-induced hypersensitivity of the outer membrane to digitonin. Our experiments have thus revealed early changes in the outer mitochondrial membrane, which take place long before cytochrome <i>c</i> is released from mitochondria in intact cells."

In this study, we have analyzed the contribution of the intergenic enhancer toShsp/αB-crystallin and Mkbp/HspB2promoter activity using dual-reporter vectors in transient transfection and transgenic mouse experiments. Deletion of the enhancer reducedShsp/αB-crystallin promoter activity by 30- and 93-fold and Mkbp/HspB2 promoter activity by 6- and 10-fold in transiently transfected mouse lens α-TN4 and myoblast C2C12 cells, respectively. Surprisingly, inversion of the enhancer reduced Shsp/αB-crystallin promoter activity by 17-fold, but did not affect Mkbp/HspB2 promoter activity in the transfected cells. In contrast, enhancer activity was orientation-independent in combination with a heterologous promoter in transfected cells. Transgenic mouse experiments established the orientation dependence and Shsp/αB-crystallin promoter preference of the intergenic enhancer in its native context. The orientation dependence and preferential effect of theShsp/αB-crystallin enhancer on theShsp/αB-crystallin promoter provide an example of adaptive changes in gene regulation accompanying the functional diversification of duplicated genes during evolution."

PAX3-FKHR results from a t(2,13) chromosomal translocation, a unique genetic marker of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. In this study, we showed that ectopic expression of PAX3-FKHR, but not Pax3, in fibroblasts altered cell cycle control and accelerated G0/G1to S cell cycle transition. PAX3-FKHR-expressing cells had reduced expression of p27Kip1 protein, a key cell cycle regulator. The reduction in p27Kip1 levels by PAX3-FKHR resulted from destabilization of p27Kip1 as shown by cycloheximide treatment and in vivo pulse-chase labeling experiments. The reduced p27Kip1 protein level in PAX3-FKHR-expressing cells was restored to the level of control cells by treatment with chemical inhibitors that specifically blocked 26 S proteasome activity. Along with the reduction in p27Kip1 protein, PAX3-FKHR-expressing cells exhibited elevated expression of F-box Skp2 protein, a substrate-specific component of SCF (Skp1-Cullin-F box protein) ligase involved in the cell cycle-dependent control of p27Kip1 ubiquitination and 26 S proteasome dependent degradation. Finally, we showed that ectopic expression of p27Kip1 in PAX3-FKHR-expressing cells significantly reduced the proliferation and colony-forming potential of these cells, implicating that down-regulation of p27Kip1 protein played an active role in the PAX3-FKHR-directed cell transformation.

Lovell M.A. Biegel J.A. Barr F.G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2869-2872PubMed Google Scholar). Both chromosomal translocations result in the same in-frame fusion of Pax genes (Pax3 gene from chromosome 2 and Pax7 gene from chromosome 1) to the FKHR gene located on chromosome 13 (11–13). Pax3 and Pax7 genes belong to a nine-member genePax transcription factor gene family (14Strachan R. Read A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 427-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). AllPax gene members share a common 128-amino acid DNA binding domain termed the paired box domain. Many members of the Pax family, including Pax3 and Pax7, contain a second DNA binding domain of the homeodomain class. The Pax3 and Pax7 transcription activation domain is localized within a serine-, glycine-, and threonine-rich region at the COOH terminus. BothPax3 and Pax7 genes have been shown to play critical roles in the development of myogenic cell lineage (15Chalepakis G. Stoykova A. Wijnholds J. Tremblay P. Gruss P. J.

The FKHR family, like thePax family, has also been implicated in developmental regulation (22Hromas R. Costa R. Crit. Rev. Oncol.

Bonni Azad Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E.

The aRMS-associated chromosomal translocations join the paired and homeodomain DNA binding motifs of the Pax3 andPax7 genes to the bisected DNA binding domain and COOH-terminal transactivation domain of FKHR gene, leading to the expression of PAX3-FKHR and PAX7-FKHR fusion transcription factors, respectively (11Davis R.J.

Much information on the oncogenic potential of the PAX-FKHR fusion proteins has come from studies that compare the functional differences between PAX3-FKHR and wild type Pax3 proteins since the bisected DNA binding domain of FKHR has not been shown to bind DNA. These studies have revealed two major differences in the activity of the fusion protein as compared with wild type counterpart. One, PAX3-FKHR is a much more potent transcription activator than the wild type Pax3 toward Pax3-responsive DNA elements (26Fredericks W.J. Galili N. Mukhopadhyay S. Rovera G. Bennicelli J. Barr F.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1522-1535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and second, PAX3-FKHR is able to target gene sequences that are not normally regulated by the wild type Pax3 (27Epstein J.A. Song B. Lakkis M. Wang C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4118-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The increased transcription potency in PAX3-FKHR is thought to result from the inability of the Pax3 NH2-terminal cis-acting repressor domain and of the trans-acting repressor proteins that interact with Pax3 DNA binding domains to repress the FKHR transactivation domain (28Bennicelli J.L. Edwards R.H. Barr F.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5455-5459Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 29Chalepakis G. Jones F.S. Eelman G.M. Gruss P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.

The increased gene-targeting range in PAX3-FKHR is proposed to result from uncoupling of the functional interdependency between the paired and homeodomain DNA binding motifs (31Cao Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9854-9862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The transactivation activity of the wild type Pax3 depends on the cooperative interaction between the two DNA binding motifs. As a result of fusion process, PAX3-FKHR is now able to bind and transactivate DNA sequences through its homeodomain alone. Recent reports indicate that the homeodomain, but not the paired domain, is critical for its cellular transformation function (31Cao Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9854-9862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 32Kempf B.E. Vogt P.K. Cell Growth Differ. 1999; 10: 813-818PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lam P.Y.P. Sublett J.E. Hollenbach A.D. Roussel M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 594-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), suggesting that the importance of identifying those genes whose expression/or function is selectively disrupted by the oncogenic form of Pax3 in understanding the mechanistic links between PAX3-FKHR and oncogenic transformation and, ultimately, the pathogenesis of rhabdomyosarcoma. In this study, we present evidence to show that the oncogenic form of Pax3 disrupts cell cycle regulation in fibroblast cells by negatively regulating the expression of p27Kip1 protein. The p27Kip1 is a member of the CIP-KIP family of cell cycle regulators (34Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar, 35Polyak K. Lee M.H.

By contrast, p27Kip1 levels decline dramatically in late G1, relieving the inhibition of cyclin E- and cyclin A-Cdk2 activities, thus promoting G1/S-transition and S-phase progression.

The present study provides evidence that one mechanism involved in PAX3-FKHR transformation is through a decrease in p27Kip1 stability due to increased action of Skp2-mediated 26 S proteasome degradation. Constructs containing mouse-human PAX3-FKHR hybrid cDNA and mouse Pax3 cDNA have been previously described (27Epstein J.A. Song B. Lakkis M. Wang C. Mol. Cell.

The retrovirus-producing Phoenix cell line was obtained from Dr. Gary Dolan. The constructs containing wild type mouse p27Kip1 cDNA, human mutant p27Kip1cDNA, and human p45Skp2 were gifts from Dr. Hiroshi Kyokawa (Department of Molecular Genetics, University of Illinois at Chicago), Dr. Kei-ichi Nakayama (Medical Institute of Bioregulation, Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan), and Dr. Hideyo Yasuda (Tokyo University of Pharmacy and Life Sciences, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. Antibodies against p27Kip1 (C-19), p45Skp2 (H-435), cyclin A (H-432), cyclin E (M-20), cyclin D (C-20), cyclin B1 (H-433), Cdk2 (H-298), p16 (F-12), p19Skp1 (C-20) were from Santa Cruz; antibody against Cullin1 was from NeoMarker; antibody against Rb was from Pharmingen; antibody against Pax3 (ab-2) was from Geneka; antibody against α-tubulin (ab-1) was from Oncogene. In vitrotranslated p27Kip1 protein was generated by the use of the T7-coupled TNT in vitro transcription-translation kit under conditions recommended by the manufacturer (Promega). Total RNA and protein extract from human skeletal muscle were purchased from Stratagene. Murine NIH3T3 fibroblast cell line and its derivative cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's high glucose medium supplemented with 200 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 1 mm glutamine, and 10% (v/v) bovine calf serum. Human aRMS cell lines RH4 and RH30 were maintained in 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum-supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. NIH3T3 cells stably expressing vector, Pax3, or PAX3-FKHR cDNA were established by the retroviral infection method as previously described (31Cao Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9854-9862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated, and results were confirmed using both clonal cell lines and the pooled cell population. In this report, with the exception of Fig. 9, only data obtained from pooled cells are presented. Whole cell extract was prepared from cells by either lysing cells in high salt extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 25% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm orthovanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml mixture of leupeptin, pepstatin A, and aprotinin) or in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml mixture of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A, 0.5 mm orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30–60 min at 4 °C with agitation. Extract was then cleared of cell debris by brief centrifugation, and clarified supernatant was stored at −80 °C until use. Cytoplasmic cell extract was prepared from cells by first swelling in low salt hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT) for 30–60 min on ice before lysis with a hand-held Dounce homogenizer. Preparation was examined under light microscopy to ensure the nuclei remained intact during homogenization. The cytoplasmic extract was cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until use. Extract was size-fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically onto nitrocellulose membrane in buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol. Proteins of interest were detected with specific antibody by the chemiluminescent antibody detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) under application conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Total RNA was prepared from cultured cells by the Trizol extraction method (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 15 μg of total RNA isolated from cells was denatured, electrophoresed on a formaldehyde-style gel, and blotted to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was hybridized to nick-translated DNA probe. Afterward, the membrane was washed twice at room temperature at low stringency (2× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 msodium citrate) and 0.1% SDS) and then twice at 42 °C at high stringency (0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS). The washed membrane was exposed for autoradiography at −80 °C. In brief, cells were first rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mmEGTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 morthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, 2 μg/ml mixture of leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A.). Cell lysate was cleared with debris by brief centrifugation. For immunoprecipitation, extract was first pre-cleared with protein A-coated Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 1 h and then used in incubation with either cyclin A- or cyclin E-specific antibody for 2 h at 4 °C followed by protein A-Sepharose treatment for 1 h at 4 °C. At the end of the immunoprecipitation reaction, the beads were thoroughly washed 3–4 times with immunoprecipitation buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate) before setting up the kinase reaction. The cyclin A- and cyclin E-associated Cdk2 kinase reactions were performed by resuspending the washed immunocomplex beads in a final volume of 20 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm ATP, 0.1 mm protein kinase A inhibitor, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 μg of histone H1. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C, terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, and analyzed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed by incubating whole cell high salt extracts (10 μg) with nonspecific salmon sperm DNA (0.5 mg/ml) in a binding buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm MgCl2, and 50 mm KCl for 5 min on ice. Routinely, 0.2 ng of a 32P-labeled E2F DNA probe prepared by Klenow labeling was added to the electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction mixture (final volume of 20 μl) and allowed to form DNA-protein complexes during a 20-min incubation at room temperature. The complex was analyzed on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out in 0.25× Tris borate-EDTA buffer at 120 V at 4 °C until the bromphenol blue dye reached the bottom, and the gel was dried and autoradiographed. The in vitrop27Kip1 degradation reaction was set up as previously described (54Nguyen H. Gitig D.M. Koff A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1190-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In vitro degradation reaction was set up by incubating 25–100 μg of hypotonic cell extract with 0.3 fmol of35S-labeled in vitro translated p27Kip1 in the presence of ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 10 μg/ml creatine kinase, 20 mmcreatine phosphate) and 1/25 (v/v) rabbit reticulocyte lysate at 30 °C for the indicated times. The reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and autoradiographed. Inactivation of PAX3-FKHR-mediated activity in rhabdomyosarcoma cells significantly impairs the growth of the tumor cells, implying that the fusion protein actively participates in the pathological progression of the disease (55Bernasconi M.

In this report, we focused on examining the effect of PAX3-FKHR on cell cycle control using NIH3T3 embryonic fibroblast cell line as a study model. In our previous studies, we have shown that ectopic expression of Pax3 protein, even at a level severalfold higher than PAX3-FKHR, is unable to transform NIH3T3 cells (31Cao Y. Wang C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9854-9862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). To better understand the changes in growth caused by PAX3-FKHR transformation, we examined the effect of PAX3-FKHR on cell proliferation using NIH3T3 cells that stably expressed PAX3-FKHR. As controls we used NIH3T3 cells that were stably transfected with the expression vector or PAX3 expression vector. As shown in Fig. 1, Pax3-expressing cells displayed a comparable growth rate as the control cells, whereas PAX3-FKHR-expressing cells exhibited a greater proliferation rate than control cells. To assess the effect of PAX3-FKHR on cell cycle behavior, we investigated the expression pattern of a number of key cell cycle regulatory proteins by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2). Although there were subtle variations in a few cell cycle regulators such as cyclin D1 and cyclin A, the most notable and reproducible changes were the decreased level of cyclin kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 protein and the increased level of hyperphosphorylated form of Rb. To verify that our observation with the p27Kip1 down-regulation was not a consequence of selecting the fastest-growing cells during establishment of stable cell lines, we carried out additional experiments to examine the status of p27Kip1 in NIH3T3 cells shortly after PAX3-FKHR expression was induced by retroviral infection. Proliferating NIH3T3 cells were infected with retroviral stock at increasing multiplicities of infection for 12 h and harvested at 12 h post-infection for Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 2 B, we observed that p27Kip1protein was specifically decreased in response to increasing amounts of PAX3-FKHR expression. Furthermore, the decrease in p27Kip1protein expression was specific for the oncogenic form of Pax3 because Pax3-expressing cells had a similar level of p27Kip1 as control cells. This result suggested that suppression of p27Kip1 protein expression was likely to play a critical role in the oncogenic function of PAX3-FKHR fusion protein. In normal cycling cells, the level of p27Kip1 protein accumulates to maximum levels during G0/G1 and declines rapidly in late G1 before cells enter S phase. To determine whether PAX3-FKHR expression affected the rate of p27Kip1 protein disappearance during the transition from G0/G1 to S phase, we examined the p27Kip1 protein profile in the control and PAX3-FKHR-transformed cells under synchronized conditions. The PAX3-FKHR-transformed cells required a longer time to exit the cell cycle than the control cells upon serum withdrawal. As shown by the fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis in Fig. 3 A, it took close to 60 h of serum deprivation (0.5% serum) for PAX3-FKHR-transformed cells to achieve G0/G1 arrest, whereas it took 24 h to achieve a similar status for the control cells. Control and PAX3-FKHR-transformed cells were synchronized to G0/G1 by 60 h of serum deprivation (0.5% serum), then they were stimulated to re-enter the cell cycle with the addition of growth medium (10% serum). At the indicated time points, cells were collected and split into two pools. One pool was used to determine p27Kip1 protein level, and the other pool was used to verify the functional consequences of the loss of p27Kip1 protein expression by measuring the activities of cyclin E and cyclin A-associated Cdk2 complexes that constitute the major targets of p27Kip1 inhibitory effect (35Polyak K.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 B, serum stimulation of PAX3-FKHR cells resulted in a much more rapid decrease in p27Kip1 protein than in the control cells. Consistent with the p27Kip1down-regulation, the PAX3-FKHR-expressing cells displayed early activation of both cyclin E- and cyclin A-associated kinase activities. The change in p27Kip1 protein levels in normal cells can be regulated at multiple levels including transcription (44Frame M.C. Wyke J.A.

Leukemia ( Baltimore ). 1997; 11: 342-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Because PAX3-FKHR acts as a transcription factor, we examined whether the change in p27Kip1 protein expression induced by PAX3-FKHR was reflected by changes in p27Kip1 mRNA content. As shown in Fig. 4, the Northern blot analysis revealed that the level of p27Kip1 mRNA was unaffected by PAX3-FKHR expression (Fig. 4 A), whereas the level of p27Kip1 protein was (Fig. 4 B). We next examined whether the reduced p27Kip1 protein level was due to changes in protein stability by carrying out cycloheximide treatment (Fig. 5 A) and in vivo pulse-chase labeling (Fig. 5 B) experiments to compare the stability of p27Kip1 protein between vector and PAX3-FKHR expressing NIH3T3 cells. Results from both experiments showed that the half-life of p27Kip1 protein was dramatically shortened in PAX3-FKHR-expressing cells. Collectively, these data suggested that altered regulation of p27Kip1 protein stability, not changes in transcription, translation, or mRNA stability, was a major cause in the reduced level of p27Kip1 protein expression in PAX3-FKHR-transformed cells.Figure 5PAX3-FKHR induces destabilization of p27Kip1 protein.

In the present studies, site-directed mutagenesis was combined with x-ray crystallography and solution liposome binding assays to probe the functional role of a cluster of interfacial basic residues in annexin V. Four mutants were investigated: R23E, K27E, R61E, and R149E. All four mutants exhibited a significant reduction in adsorption to phospholipid membranes relative to the wild-type protein, and the R23E mutation was the most deleterious. Crystal structures of wild-type and mutant proteins were similar except for local changes in salt bridges involving basic cluster residues. The combined data indicate that Arg23 is a major determinant for interfacial phospholipid binding and participates in an intermolecular salt bridge that is key for trimer formation on the membrane surface. Together, crystallographic and solution data provide evidence that the interfacial basic cluster is a locus where trimerization is synergistically coupled to membrane phospholipid binding.

This property underlies many proposed in vivo annexin functions, including membrane trafficking, cell signaling, and roles in inflammatory and coagulation processes. Annexin V is an abundant protein that binds preferentially to acidic phospholipid membranes in the presence of Ca2+. The annexin-phospholipid association is of high affinity but is reversible with the removal of Ca2+. When bound to the membrane surface, annexin V molecules assemble laterally into well organized trimers and higher order arrays of trimers (6Oling F. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This lateral assembly promotes spontaneous two-dimensional crystallization of annexin V on membrane surfaces, a process that is inhibited by extreme membrane surface curvature (7Andree H.A.M.

Annexin-coated membrane surfaces undergo changes in their properties, becoming markedly rigid as the crystallization domains increase in size (9Wu F. Gericke A. Flach C.R. Mealy T.R.

This membrane-bound layer of annexin V, which has anticoagulant properties, is believed to play a functional role in processes associated with the protein. In placenta, reduced levels of annexin V occur with anti-phospholipid syndrome, which causes hypercoagulation and recurrent miscarriage. Rand and co-workers (12Rand J.H. Wu X.X. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 82: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 13Rand J.H. J. Autoimmun. 2000; 15: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) have proposed a mechanism for anti-phospholipid syndrome in which the disease process strips off the protective layer of annexin V at the maternal-fetal interface, permitting excessive thrombosis to occur. The mechanism of membrane adsorption of annexin V has generated considerable interest from many disciplines, from clinical to structural biology. The protein provides an excellent model for elucidating complex interfacial behavior by peripheral membrane proteins. The molecular structure of the 35-kDa protein has been well characterized in both soluble and membrane-bound forms by x-ray crystallography (14Huber R. Schneider M. Mayr I. Römisch J. Pâques E.P.

Monomeric annexin V possesses four internally homologous domains, arranged in pairs. The molecule possesses an extensive membrane binding surface, from which calcium-binding loops protrude. Ca2+ bridges, in which the Ca2+ ion is jointly coordinated by protein and phospholipid oxygen ligands, form at these loops (22Swairjo M.A. Concha N.O. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 968-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Formation of annexin V homotrimers occurs only on membrane surfaces, suggesting that the interfacial surface provides the correct orientation of the bound monomers for oligomerization. The forces that drive this process have not been characterized at the atomic level. The present studies provide evidence that an interfacial cluster of basic residues synergistically couples membrane phospholipid binding and trimerization on the membrane surface. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Clontech transformer kit as described previously (23Campos B., Mo, Y.D. Mealy T.R., Li, C.W. Swairjo M.A. Balch C. Head J.F. Retzinger G. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8004-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To produce the R23E, R61E, and R149E mutants, the GGG codon was changed to GAG. For the K27E mutant, the AAA codon was changed to GAA. Each mutation was verified by double-stranded DNA sequence analysis. Proteins were expressed from cultures of Escherichia coli strain JM101 and purified using lipid affinity chromatography as described (23Campos B., Mo, Y.D. Mealy T.R., Li, C.W. Swairjo M.A. Balch C. Head J.F. Retzinger G. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8004-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was measured using the Pierce BCA protein assay. The fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)1 assay, which is based upon self-quenching of the NBD chromophore that results from annexin-induced clustering of phospholipids (24Bazzi M.D. Nelsestuen G.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7961-7969Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), was performed as described previously (23Campos B., Mo, Y.D. Mealy T.R., Li, C.W. Swairjo M.A. Balch C. Head J.F. Retzinger G. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8004-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) using large (100-nm) unilamellar vesicles containing 85 mol % phosphatidylcholine and 15 mol % 1–18:1,2-C12-NBD-PS. Measurements were obtained using a 95% confidence level (p = 0.05). The sedimentation assay, which measures the Ca2+ concentration required for half-maximal liposome binding, also was performed as described previously using small unilamellar vesicles of 1:1 mixtures of DOPS/DOPC (Avanti Polar Lipids) (23Campos B., Mo, Y.D. Mealy T.R., Li, C.W. Swairjo M.A. Balch C. Head J.F. Retzinger G. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8004-8010Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, mixtures of annexin V and phospholipid vesicles were incubated together under a range of CaCl2 concentrations, where CaCl2 is added in 5–10 μm increments to buffer containing 0.1 mm EGTA, and then centrifuged. The Centricon-filtered pellet and its filtrate were collected at each CaCl2concentration and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The half-maximal Ca2+ concentration is found where the relative band intensities of the filtrate and retentate (reflecting free and bound protein populations, respectively) are approximately equal as detected by eye and by densitometry. The half-maximal Ca2+concentration is measured experimentally as falling within a concentration range, where, at the lower concentration, the filtrate band is greater than that of the retentate, and, at the higher concentration, the reverse is true. The same buffer solutions are used for all the protein samples, providing a qualitative but highly reproducible hierarchy for the set of annexin V wild-type and mutant proteins. It should be noted that the Ca2+-dependent association of wild-type annexin V with these vesicles is sufficiently tight that no protein can be detected in filtrate samples prepared as described, even with no CaCl2 added to the EGTA-containing buffer. For the DOPS/DOPC vesicle binding studies, centrifugation and filtration were used again to separate free annexin V from that portion bound to the vesicles using the protocol of Feng et al.(25Feng J. Wehbi H. Roberts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19867-19875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A 10 mm stock of unilamellar vesicles was prepared by multiple passages of aqueous 1:4 DOPS/DOPC solution through 100-nm pore diameter polycarbonate membranes (annexin V binds only to the DOPS component). Samples for the binding assays were prepared with 0.4 μm annexin V in 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mmHEPES-buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm CaCl2. The bulk concentrations of DOPS were 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 8 μm for all annexin V samples. After a 45-min incubation at room temperature, the samples were applied to 2-ml Centricon YM100 (100-kDa molecular mass cut-off) filters, which were centrifuged at 990 ×g for 90 min or until all of the solution had passed through the filter. The filtrate, which contained the unbound protein, was collected and lyophilized overnight. SDS-PAGE (12.5% polyacrylamide) was used to quantitate the free annexin V. Samples were prepared by adding 35 μl of sample buffer that did not contain any buffering agent. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. After destaining, the gels were dried, scanned, and imaged using the public domain software, ImageJ (by Wayne Rasband; available on the World Wide Web at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij) to monitor annexin V band intensities. Comparison of band intensities with an annexin V sample incubated without vesicles was used to measure the fraction of free protein (P f/P t, whereP t is the total amount of protein). The bound fraction, P b, was evaluated as (1 −P f/P t). The wild-type data fit a standard “noncooperative” Langmuir adsorption isotherm (26Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which yielded the dissociation constant, K d, and the number of lipid binding sites per annexin molecule. For the mutants, significant sigmoidicity was observed in their binding curves, so the apparent dissociation constants,K d(app), defined as the lipid concentration giving rise to half-maximal membrane binding of the protein, were estimated graphically derived from the binding curves. In addition, the binding isotherms were fit to the equationP b/P t = 1/(1 + ((K d)app/[DOPS]) h ) to yieldK d(app) and the Hill coefficient,h. For all three liposome binding assays, measurements were obtained in triplicate. Three of the four recombinant rat annexin V mutants, R23E, K27E, and R149E, crystallized under the same conditions as the wild-type protein (i.e. vapor diffusion against a reservoir of 34–40% saturated ammonium sulfate, 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mmCaCl2). The final protein and CaCl2concentrations after equilibration were 14 mg/ml and 20 mm, respectively. The R61E mutant failed to crystallize. X-ray data were collected at room temperature on an R-Axis IIc imaging plate detector mounted on a Rigaku RU-300 rotating anode generator. Data were indexed, analyzed, and scaled using DENZO and SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The mutant proteins produced R3 crystals isomorphous with wild-type rat annexin V (16Concha N.O. Head J.F. Kaetzel M.A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1321-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), with one molecule per asymmetric unit. Partial merohedral twinning was detected (28Yeates T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) in the R23E mutant data. A twin fraction of 0.213 was obtained using the twinning operator h, -h-k, -l, and the data were detwinned using CNS (29Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

Open table in a new tab The four mutants and wild-type annexin V were assayed in the presence of calcium and 1:1 DOPS/DOPC liposomes. In FRET measurements, which reflect the extent of annexin-induced clustering of acidic phospholipids following membrane adsorption, the mutants produced less quenching than wild-type annexin V. The order of quenching in the FRET experiments was as follows: wild type > R149E > K27E > R61E > R23E (Fig. 1). A similar hierarchy was apparent from the liposome sedimentation assay measuring the half-maximal Ca2+ concentrations required for membrane binding (Fig. 2), except that R61E was more similar to the K27E than to the R23E phenotype. In this assay, higher half-maximal Ca2+ concentrations reflect lower intrinsic affinity for membranes (i.e. higher levels of Ca2+ offset weaker membrane binding affinity due to the synergism between Ca2+ and membrane binding in this system). Taken together, these assays demonstrate that the mutants exhibit lower membrane affinity than wild-type protein, with R23E showing the weakest interaction.Figure 2Liposome sedimentation assay comparing calcium dependence of the membrane association of annexin V wild-type and mutants.

The wild-type data fit well to a Langmuir isotherm and yielded a value of 4.2 ± 0.3 forn, the number of lipid molecules bound per annexin V molecule. In contrast, the binding isotherms for the mutants were distinctly sigmoidal (Fig. 3), consistent with their weaker binding and greater dependence upon clustering of acidic lipids for adsorption. Hill coefficients were similar (h = 3–4) in all four mutants. The apparentK d values were in the range of 1–5 μmand showed a trend: R149E < K27E < R61E = R23E (TableII). The apparent K dvalues measured at this fixed protein concentration are all higher than the apparent K d extracted for the wild-type protein (<1 μm; data not shown).Table IIComparative binding of annexin V mutants to liposomes containing DOPSMutantApparentK dHill coefficientμmR149E1.56 ± 0.073.75 ± 0.46K27E3.32 ± 0.173.20 ± 0.43R61E4.76 ± 0.233.35 ± 0.35R23E4.73 ± 0.323.90 ± 0.75 Open table in a new tab In crystallization trials, K27E and R149E mutants behaved nearly as well as wild-type annexin V, forming crystals that grew quickly and diffracted well (2.0-Å resolution versus 1.8 Å for wild type), whereas the R23E and R61E mutants performed very poorly during crystallization trials. The R61E mutant failed to crystallize, and the R23E mutant produced over several months only a single, merohedrally twinned crystal. This crystal produced no observable diffraction beyond 2.7-Å resolution, and data were only usable to 3.0 Å. The tertiary structures of the R23E, K27E, and R149E mutants are essentially identical to that of the wild-type protein, with root mean square deviations in C-α atoms of 0.494, 0.356, and 0.344 Å2, respectively. Two to five Ca2+ ions are observed in the structures. The Ca2+ ion bound in the IAB loop is present in all of the structures. Another shared feature is a Ca2+ ion found in the IIIAB loop (residues 182–188) and a sulfate ion coordinating that Ca2+. Structural differences between the wild-type and mutant structures are localized to the immediate vicinity of the basic cluster (Fig. 4). 1) In R149E, the Arg61forms a strong salt bridge with the mutated Glu149′ side-chain (residues from the adjacent subunit are designated with a prime). To form this new bridge, the Arg61 side chain moves 0.5 Å away from Arg23. 2) In K27E, the mutated Glu27 interacts only with solvent. The substitution removes the intermolecular Lys27–Glu190′ salt bridge. 3) In R23E, more significant alterations are observed: (i) Arg61 forms a new intramolecular salt bridge with the mutated Glu23 side chain; (ii) neither Arg23nor Arg61 bind the sulfate ion, which remains associated with the protein only via the Gly28 main chain; and (iii) the Arg23-Glu190′ interaction is lost, and Glu190′ forms an intermolecular salt bridge only with Lys27. Surface clusters of basic amino acids occur infrequently in proteins, where they usually play specialized roles. Proteins that utilize basic clusters for their association with phospholipid membranes include some forms of secretory phospholipase A2(34Snitko Y. Koduri R.S. Han S.K. Othman R. Baker S.F.

In those studies, the roles of membrane interfacial cationic residues were investigated using site-directed mutagenesis and membrane binding and enzyme activity assays. The present study takes this approach a step further by additionally evaluating the structural consequences of each mutation at the atomic level with x-ray crystallography to make detailed structure-function correlations. Membrane adsorption properties for annexin V mutants were determined through liposome binding assays. The use of x-ray crystallography in the present work provides not only high resolution structural details but also a relative measure of annexin V trimer formation capabilities for the mutants. Since annexin V trimer formation is reversible and occurs only on membrane surfaces, trimerization is difficult to measure directly in solution, and no reliable assay has been developed. However, the ability to form stable trimers is requisite to form R3 crystals. Studies combining high resolution cryoelectron microscopy with x-ray crystallography have demonstrated that for annexin V, the trimers obtained from two-dimensional crystals on lipid monolayers or three-dimensional crystals from solution have the same structure (21Oling F. Sopkova-de Oliviera Santos J. Govorukhina N. Mazeres-Dubut C. Bergsma-Schutter W. Oostergetel G. Keegstra W. Lambert O. Lewit-Bentley A. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional crystallization thus can provide a useful comparative measure of the propensity of wild-type and mutant annexin V proteins to form trimers and higher order aggregates. In wild-type annexin V, the basic cluster is situated between trimer subunits at the largely hydrophilic subunit interface (Figs. 4 a and 5). The cationic side chains of the cluster reside in a cleft slightly above the plane of the Ca2+-binding loops that comprise the membrane surface. The cationic functional groups of Lys27, Arg23, Arg61, and Arg149′ form a closely spaced row, each separated by 4–5 Å (Fig. 4 a). Arg23, Lys27, and Arg61, all from domain I, each participate in one or more electrostatic interactions, mostly strong salt bridges with lengths of <3 Å (TableIII). An intermolecular salt bridge is made between Arg61 and Asp66, whereas Glu190′ from the adjacent subunit makes intermolecular salt bridges with Arg23 and Lys27 side chains. Arg149′ and Glu190′ are from domains II and III, respectively. Arg149′ does not form any salt bridges, although it makes up part of the cluster.Table IIIElectrostatic interactions at the annexin V basic clusterWild typeK27ER149ER23EArg23SO4 O1(NH1)3.28SO4 O2(NH1)3.15Mutated to GluSO4 O2(NH2)2.85SO4 O1(NH2)2.59SO4 O1(NH2)2.98E190′ OE1(NH2)3.07E190′ OE1(NH2)3.13E190′ OE1(NH2)3.46E190′ OE1(NE)2.93E190′ OE1(NE)3.03E190′ OE2(NE)3.15Arg61SO4 O1(NH2)3.59SO4 O2(NH2)3.98SO4 O2(NH2)3.50SO4 O1(NH1)3.92SO4 O2(NH2)4.04D66 OD1(NH1)3.86D66 OD1(NH2)3.34D66 OD2(NH2)3.43D66 OD1(NE)3.87D66 OD2(NH1)3.98D66 OD2(NE)2.82D66 OD1(NE)2.96D66 OD1(NH1)2.86E149′ OE2(NH1)2.66E23 OE1(NH2)3.77E23 OE2(NH1)2.36Lys27E190′ OE2(NZ)2.97Mutated to GluE190′ OE1(NZ)2.48E190′ OE2(NZ)3.76E190′ OE1(NZ)3.56E23 OE1(NZ)2.65Arg149′Mutated to GluGly28SO4 O3(N)2.31SO4 O3(N)2.81SO4 O4(N)2.92SO4 O4(N)2.69 Open table in a new tab Bound sulfate ions in several annexin V crystal structures have usefully located potential phospholipid binding sites. In structures of wild-type annexin V crystallized from ammonium sulfate, a strongly bound sulfate ion forms one of seven ligands in the primary coordination shell of the Ca2+ ion in the IIIAB loop (15Huber R. Berendes R. Burger A. Schneider M. Karshikov A. Luecke H. Römisch J. Pâques E.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 683-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 17Sopkova J. Renouard M. Lewit-Bentley A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In the crystal structures of two ternary complexes formed between annexin V, Ca2+, and phospholipid head group analogs, this sulfate ion site is occupied by a phosphoryl group (21Oling F. Sopkova-de Oliviera Santos J. Govorukhina N. Mazeres-Dubut C. Bergsma-Schutter W. Oostergetel G. Keegstra W. Lambert O. Lewit-Bentley A. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another significant binding site for sulfate ion is observed at the basic cluster in wild-type annexin V (Fig. 4 a). This sulfate ion forms several interactions with the protein: salt bridges with Arg23 and Arg61 side chains and a hydrogen bond to the amide nitrogen of Gly28 in the IAB Ca2+-binding loop (residues 26–32). Despite its close proximity (6 Å) to the IAB Ca2+ ion, there is no direct coordination between the metal and sulfate ions as occurs in the IIIAB loop. Instead, Gly28 coordinates the metal ion via its carbonyl oxygen while forming a bond to the sulfate ion through its amide nitrogen. This bridging arrangement is an example of the synergy between Ca2+ and phospholipids in the annexin system. The membrane binding behavior of annexin V is complex, with many interrelated variables, including calcium concentration, lipid composition, and membrane curvature. We used three different liposome binding assays to probe the effect of mutation on annexin-membrane interactions. In our studies, all four mutants exhibit significantly reduced adsorption to acidic membranes, compared with wild type, confirming the importance of the basic cluster in membrane binding. Since these are charge reversal mutations, some loss of affinity in binding to acidic membranes would be expected simply from reducing the overall net positive charge of the cluster from +4 to +2. However, the varied impairment of the different phenotypes demonstrates that the mutated residues are not functionally interchangeable. In all three binding assays, R149E is the most similar to wild type, followed by K27E, and the R23E mutant is the most deleterious, whereas the properties of R61E range between those of K27E and R23E, depending upon the assay. In terms of calcium dependence, R61E behaves more like K27E; in the FRET assay, it falls in between K27E and R23E, and its K d(app) for DOPS binding is equivalent to that of R23E. The structural basis of the R61E properties could not be determined since R61E failed to crystallize. For the structurally characterized mutants, a direct correlation can be made between membrane binding affinity (R149E > K27E > R23E) and the number of bonds formed between the sulfate ion and Arg23 (R149E, 2; K27E, 1; R23E, 0). The number of Arg61–sulfate bonds appears to be less critical but has sufficient influence to reduce membrane binding affinity of R149E relative to wild-type annexin V. In wild-type protein, the sulfate ion is held by two sets of interactions: (i) a hydrogen bond with Gly28 and (ii) salt bridges to the Arg23 and Arg61 guanidinium groups, each providing two bonds to the sulfate. In the mutants, the sulfate–Gly28 hydrogen bond is unaffected, but interactions with the basic cluster vary by phenotype (Table III, Fig. 4). For R149E, the least deleterious mutant phenotype, the Arg23–sulfate bond is unperturbed. However, the Arg61 guanidinium group shifts 0.5 Å (centroid-centroid distance) away from the sulfate ion, removing one bond to the sulfate and lengthening the bond distance for the other. In K27E, the Arg23 guanidinium group reorients its position to form a salt bridge with the mutated Glu27. This shift removes one Arg23–sulfate bond and lengthens both Arg61–sulfate bonds. For R23E, contact is lost completely between the sulfate ion and the basic cluster; the mutation has removed the Arg23 side chain and shifted the Arg61guanidinium group >2 Å away from the sulfate. Apart from distinctions in their membrane adsorption properties, the mutants also exhibit varying abilities to form quarternary structure through self-association. In this property, Arg23 again appears to play a key role, this time through formation of an intermolecular salt bridge with Glu190′. The mutational analysis suggests that the Arg23-Glu190′ ion pair is a key feature in promoting oligomerization and crystallization. In wild-type annexin V, the importance of having an intermolecular bridge at this site is supported by its apparent functional redundancy; both Arg23and Lys27 form salt-bridges to Glu190′. The arginine guanidinium group makes more interactions with Glu190′ than does the lysine ε-amino group, giving the Arg23-Glu190′ bridge greater stabilizing power. The combined results show that if Lys27 is removed but Arg23 is retained, as in the K27E mutant, crystallization is not much different from wild type. However, in the reverse case, when Arg23 is removed, leaving only Lys27, as in the R23E mutant, crystallization is severely impaired. The net number of intermolecular salt bridges, surprisingly, is less important to crystallization. The R149E mutant forms one more salt bridge (Arg61-Glu149′) than is found in wild-type, yet R149E crystals are more similar to those of K27E, diffracting to resolution than wild-type. The effects of the R61E mutation on trimer formation can only be speculative in the absence of crystallographic data. In the wild-type protein, Arg61 makes no intermolecular bonds and would seem to have little influence on protein-protein interactions. However, it is possible that in R61E, the mutated Glu61 competes with Glu190′ for the Arg23 guanidinium group, thereby interfering with Arg23-Glu190′ salt bridge formation and inhibiting crystallization. The basic cluster is not invariant in annexins but appears to be restricted to the subset that have been shown to form trimers on membrane surfaces: annexins IV (39Kaetzel M.A., Mo, Y.D. Mealy T.R. Campos B. Bergsma-Schutter W. Brisson A. Dedman J.R. Seaton B.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4192-4199Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), V (21Oling F. Sopkova-de Oliviera Santos J. Govorukhina N. Mazeres-Dubut C. Bergsma-Schutter W. Oostergetel G. Keegstra W. Lambert O. Lewit-Bentley A. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and VI (40Driessen H.P. Newman R.H. Freemont P.S. Crumpton M.J. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This distribution suggests that the basic cluster plays a specialized role in these particular annexins (i.e. stabilizing trimer subunit interactions). The crystal structure of annexin IV (Thr6→ Asp mutant; PDB code 1I4A) crystallized from ammonium sulfate presents the four conserved basic residues in a subtly different spatial arrangement than in annexin V. However, the cluster appears to be functionally similar in the two proteins. In annexin IV (Fig. 4 e), the Arg23, Lys27, Arg61, and Arg149′ side chains form a circular cationic patch that binds a sulfate ion, forming numerous strong salt bridges with Arg23, Lys27, and Arg149′. The Arg61 side chain does not interact with the sulfate ion but may contribute to the net cationic character of the cluster, as does Arg149′ in annexin V. Glu190′, the important salt bridge partner of Arg23 and Lys27 in annexin V, is not conserved in annexin IV and is replaced by valine. Instead of the Arg23-Glu190′ salt bridge, the sulfate ion cross-links the two subunits by forming a complex network of strong salt bridges with Arg23, Lys27, and Arg149′. In serving as a subunit cross-linker, the sulfate ion moves away from the calcium binding loop to take a position spatially analogous to the carboxylate group of Glu190′ in annexin V. This alternate but effective arrangement in annexin IV provides another example of how phospholipid binding and trimerization are coupled at the basic cluster site. In annexin VI, the spatial arrangement of basic cluster residues more closely resembles that of annexin V than IV. Annexin VI is a unique, eight-repeat annexin in which each half of the molecule (designated VIA or VIB) corresponds to the core region of a tetrad repeat annexin. In annexin VI, the two tetrad lobes A and B are rotated about 90° from each other, connected by a linker region. However, the two lobes can adopt different relative orientations (41Benz J. Berger A. Hofmann A. Demange P. Gottig P. Liemann S. Huber R. Voges D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 42Avila-Sakar A.J. Kretsinger R.H. Creutz C.E. J. Struct. Biol. 2000; 130: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the x-ray crystal structure of annexin VI (PDB code 1AVC) (43Avila-Sakar A.J. Creutz C.E. Kretsinger R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the basic cluster occurs only in the VIB lobe, where Arg373, Lys377, and Arg411 correspond to Arg23, Lys27, and Arg61 in annexins IV and V. The existence of a functionally equivalent residue to Arg149′ in annexins IV and V is difficult to predict, since the tertiary and quaternary structure of annexin VI is more complex. Furthermore, in this structure, the crystallization medium did not contain sulfate ions (43Avila-Sakar A.J. Creutz C.E. Kretsinger R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 103-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, despite the structural differences, most features of the basic cluster are retained in VI, including the intramolecular salt bridge between Arg411 and Arg416 (equivalent to Arg61-Arg66 annexins IV and V) and an intermolecular salt bridge between Arg373 and Glu27′ (equivalent to Arg23-Glu190′ in annexin V). Whereas the precise details may differ among these trimer-forming annexins, their oligomerization mechanism on membrane surfaces may involve the same key elements. The central influence of Arg23 or its equivalent in mediating and facilitating protein-protein contacts is a common feature in annexins IV, V, and VI. Whereas data are not available yet for annexin VI, annexins IV and V both couple phospholipid binding and subunit stabilization through mechanisms involving the basic cluster; in annexin V, cross-linking of subunits is promoted via the intermolecular Arg23-Glu190′ salt bridge and in annexin IV, cross-linking is promoted through a sulfate ion that bridges basic cluster side chains in adjacent subunits."

Surprisingly, we found that about 25% of the outer membrane protein (OMP) OmpA synthesized after SecA depletion was gradually translocated across the inner membrane. In this study we analyzed the export of several other OMPs after SecA depletion. We found that 25–50% of each OMP as well as an OmpA-alkaline phosphatase fusion protein was exported from SecA-deficient cells. This partial export was completely abolished by the SecA inhibitor sodium azide and therefore still required the participation of SecA. Examination of a variety of OmpA derivatives, however, ruled out the possibility that OMPs are selectively translocated in SecA-deficient cells because SecA binds to their N termini with unusually high affinity. Export after SecA depletion was observed in cells that lack SecB, the primary targeting factor for OMPs, but was abolished by partial inactivation of DnaK. Furthermore, OmpA could be isolated in a stable complex with DnaK. The data strongly suggest that OMPs require only a relatively low level of translocase activity to cross the inner membrane because they can be preserved in a prolonged export-competent state by DnaK.

Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 315-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and 2Danese P.N. Silhavy T.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1998; 32: 59-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Chaperones do not recognize signal peptides and do not necessarily mediate direct interactions with membrane proteins, but they invariably play two critical roles in the export process. First, they maintain their cargo in a loosely folded conformation that is required for transport across the membrane (3Randall S.J.S. Hardy L.L. Cell. 1986; 46: 921-928Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). In addition, they keep signal peptides accessible for interactions with components of the membrane-bound translocation machinery. A subset of Gram-negative bacteria produce a chaperone called SecB whose only known function is to maintain the transport competence of presecretory proteins. In Escherichia coli, SecB is required for the efficient export of many outer membrane proteins (OMPs) as well as a few periplasmic proteins such as maltose-binding protein (MBP) (4Kumamoto C.A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SecB is a tetramer that interacts with its ligands via an ATP-independent kinetic partitioning mechanism (5Hardy S.J.S. Randall L.L. Science. 1991; 251: 439-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 6Khisty V.J. Randall L.L. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3277-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have indicated that highly abundant molecular chaperones such as DnaK and GroEL, which play essential roles in protein folding, can also maintain the transport competence of presecretory proteins (7Lecker S.

Rossmeissl P. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3608-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). DnaK and GroEL are structurally unrelated to SecB and bind polypeptides in an ATP-dependent cycle that is regulated by co-chaperones (11Bukau B. Horwich A.L.

Nature. 1999; 402: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, available evidence suggests that chaperones have overlapping functions in the protein export pathway. Indeed the functional redundancy of chaperones may explain why SecB is not essential for cell viability. A great deal of evidence indicates that a single translocation complex or “translocase” plays a predominant role in the subsequent transport of presecretory proteins across the IM (reviewed in Ref. 15Economou A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The core of the translocase (the “SecY complex”) consists of a heterotrimer of integral membrane proteins (SecY, SecE, and SecG) and a homodimer (SecA) that is found in both soluble and membrane-associated forms. The importance of the E. coli secY,secE, and secA genes was initially suggested by genetic studies. Each gene was isolated in multiple independent screens for mutations that affect secretion and was shown to be essential for viability (16Schatz P.J. Beckwith J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1990; 24: 215-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Subsequently, inactivation or depletion of any of the core translocase subunits was shown to severely impair the export of a wide variety of proteins in vivo and in vitro(17Oliver D.B. Beckwith J. Cell. 1981; 25: 765-772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 18Shiba K. Ito K. Yura T. Ceretti D.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 12394-12400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The SecY complex is thought to be the pore through which proteins traverse the membrane. Consistent with this view, EM reconstruction studies have indicated that the Bacillus subtilis SecY complex forms an oligomeric ring structure (22Meyer T.H. Ménétret J.-F. Breitling R. Miller K.R. Akey C.W. Rapoport T.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1798-1800Crossref Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The SecY complex is universally conserved throughout evolution, and its eukaryotic counterpart (the “Sec61p” complex) facilitates transport of proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum. The SecA protein, which is unique to bacteria, functions as a molecular motor that uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to drive proteins across the IM. Starting at the signal peptide, SecA promotes translocation of ∼20 amino acid loops of presecretory proteins in a ratchet-like fashion (23Schiebel E. Driessen A.J.M. Hartl F.-U. Wickner W. Cell. 1991; 64: 927-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Together, the SecY complex and SecA are both necessary and sufficient for protein translocation into lipid vesicles in a reconstituted system (24Brundage L. Hendrick J.P. Schiebel E. Driessen A.J. Wickner W. Cell. 1990; 62: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Despite the apparent centrality of the SecY/SecA translocase, the possibility that alternate transport pathways also exist in E. coli has been raised by several different studies. Most of these studies show that the translocation of OMPs, but not periplasmic proteins, can be observed under conditions where the Sec machinery is severely impaired. OMPs are relatively hydrophilic, but unlike typical periplasmic proteins they are comprised entirely of β-strands (or, as in the case of OmpA, contain a large all β-strand domain) that forms a “β-barrel” upon integration into the outer membrane. In translocation assays performed using inverted membrane vesicles prepared from E. coli containing <5% of the wild-type level of SecY, SecE, or SecG, OMPs such as LamB and OmpA were translocated at an appreciable level (25Yang Y.-B., Yu, N. Tai P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13660-13665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Yang Y.-B. Lian J. Tai P.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7386-7393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments little or no alkaline phosphatase (AP), a periplasmic protein, was translocated into the vesicles. Likewise, about 25% of the OmpA synthesized after substantial SecA depletion was still properly localized in intact cells but no export of two different periplasmic proteins was detected (27Qi H.-Y. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8993-8997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Under conditions where overexpression of AP inhibited protein export (possibly by jamming translocation pores), significant translocation of OmpA was observed but β-lactamase (Bla) transport was completely blocked (28Kadokura H. Watanabe K. Tsuneizumi K. Yoda K. Yamasaki M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3596-3600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results are all difficult to interpret, however, because the possibility that export of some proteins requires only very low levels of Sec activity cannot be ruled out. In this study we examined the phenomenon of differential protein export in Sec-deficient cells in more detail. We observed slow but significant export of every OMP that we examined after SecA depletion. By contrast, we could not detect export of any periplasmic protein under the same conditions. OMP export was absolutely dependent, however, upon the presence of a low level of SecA activity. Taken together, several lines of evidence suggested that the selective translocation of OMPs in SecA-depleted cells is due to the ability of DnaK to maintain them in a prolonged translocation-competent state. The data show how protein export in Sec-impaired cells can be explained without invoking the existence of Sec-independent transport pathways and also provide novel insights into the function of DnaK in vivo. Polyclonal antisera were obtained from 5 Prime-3 Prime Inc., Boulder, CO (Bla and AP), New England Biolabs (MBP), Covance (influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) epitope HA.11), Dr. Jon Beckwith (ribose-binding protein, DegP, and OmpA), Dr. Greg Phillips (OmpC and OmpF), and Dr. Tom Silhavy (LamB). A monoclonal antibody against DnaK was obtained from Stressgen. Normal mouse serum and normal rabbit serum were the kind gifts of Dr. Chong-shan Shi. The bacterial strains used in this study and their genotypes are BA13 (MC4100 supFtstrpam secA13amzch::Tn10) (Ref. 20Cabelli R.J. Chen L. Tai P.C. Oliver D.B. Cell. 1988; 55: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), DO251 (MC4100supFts leu::Tn5 zch::Tn10), HDB108 (BA13secB::kan), and HDB109 (BA13secA+ secB::kan). Media preparation and basic bacterial manipulations were performed using standard methods (29Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). Selective media contained 100 μg/ml ampicillin as required. Plasmid pHQ10 was constructed by introducing a point mutation (A2785T) into pMAL-p2X (New England Biolabs). The mutation allowed expression of wild-type malEby placing a stop codon after the malE portion of amalE-lacZα fusion. Plasmids pS368 and pS368 (DnaK A174T) containing wild-type and mutant dnaK genes and plasmid pAP-1 have been described previously (30Bernstein H.D. Hyndman J.B. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 2187-2197Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 31Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12451-12456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The ompA gene was amplified by PCR using E. coli genomic DNA (strain LE392) as a template and cloned behind the lac promoter in a modified version of plasmid RB11 containing a pUC19 polylinker (pJN3.2) to create pRB11-OmpA (33Inouye H. Michaelis S. Wright A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the PCR reaction an EcoRI site was introduced 35 base pairs upstream of the ompAtranslational start site. A version of this plasmid in which an HA tag (YPYDVPDYASL) was introduced at the C terminus of OmpA (pRB11-OmpA-HA; Ref. 32Lee H.C. Bernstein H.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3471-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) was also used in some experiments. Plasmids used to produce OmpA derivatives were constructed as follows. Plasmid pHQ12 (which produces pro-OmpA*) was constructed by introducing L164P and V166D mutations into pRB11-OmpA-HA. Plasmid pJH32 (which produces pro-OmpA(Δ1)) was generated by first introducing a mutation (V101L) into pRB11-OmpA to create a new SphI site. The resulting plasmid was then digested with SphI to remove the fragment encoding OmpA amino acids 101–161 and religated. Plasmid pJH33 (which produces pro-OmpA(Δ2)) was constructed by inserting the oligonucleotide 5′-GATCAGTATCCGTACGATGTGCCGGATTATGCGAGCCTGTAA-3′ and its complement, which encode an HA tag, into the BamHI site of RB11-OmpA. NdeI and EagI restriction sites were introduced into pJH33 at the start of ompA and at the end of the signal peptide to create pJH34. Oligonucleotides encoding the AP signal peptide (5′-TATGAAAGTGAAACAAAGCACAATTGCACTGGCACTCTTACCGTTACTGTTTACCCCTGTGACAAA-3′ and 5′-GGCCTTTGTCACAGGGGTAAACAGTAACGGTAAGAGTGCCAGTGCAATTGTGCTTTGTTTCACTTTCA-3′) were then ligated to pJH34 to generate pJH35 (which produces APss-OmpA(Δ2)). To construct pJH36, a DNA fragment containing sequences upstream of ompA and theompA β-barrel domain was first amplified by PCR using pRB11-OmpA as a template. To facilitate cloning, an XmaI site was introduced at the end of the β-barrel domain in the PCR reaction. The PCR product was then digested with EcoRI andXmaI and cloned into the cognate sites of pJN3.2. Subsequently, the oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTTTACAGGCTCGCATAATCCGGCACATCGTACGGATATG-3′ and 5′-CCGGCATATCCGTACGATGTGCCGGATTATGCGAGCCTGTAA-3′, which encode an HA tag, were ligated to the XmaI and HindIII sites of pJH36 to generate pJH37 (which encodes pro-OmpA(Δ3)). The AP gene was amplified using oligonucleotides 5′-GCCCGTGATCTGCCATTAGATCTGGTTGC-3′ and either 5′-CGGGCTGCTCAGGGAGATCTTACTGCAC-3′ or 5′-GTTCTGGAAAACCGGGCTGCTCAGGGCATGCTTACTGCAC-3′ and pHI-1 (33Inouye H. Michaelis S. Wright A. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 668-675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as a template and cloned into the BamHI site or SphI and BamHI sites of pRB11-OmpA, respectively, to construct pJH38 and pJH39 (encoding pro-OmpA(Δ2)-AP and pro-OmpA(Δ3)-AP). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were grown at 30 °C in M9 medium supplemented with amino acids as described (27Qi H.-Y. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8993-8997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and shifted to 41 °C when cultures reached A 550 = 0.05. After a further incubation of 3 h, cells were subjected to pulse-chase labeling as described (34Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To induce malE expression, 20 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to cells that contained plasmid pHQ10 30 min prior to labeling. To induce synthesis of an OmpA derivative, 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to cells that contained plasmids pJH32-39 1 h prior to labeling. Proteins were subsequently collected by trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and immunoprecipitations were performed as described (34Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). In some experiments, a portion of each culture was treated with 2 mm sodium azide 2 min before pulse labeling or with 100 μg/ml chloramphenicol 1 min after pulse labeling. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed using a previously described method (35Teter S.A. Houry W.A. Ang D. Tradler T. Rockabrand D. Fischer G. Blum P. Georgopoulos C. Hartl F.U. Cell. 1999; 97: 755-765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Following a 30-s pulse label and a 2-min chase, cells were converted to spheroplasts by incubating them on ice for 20 min in the presence of 10 μg/ml lysozyme and 2 mm EDTA. Spheroplasts were isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min, washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm MgSO4, and lysed in 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA. After lysis, 140 mmNaCl and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) were added. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 5 min to remove membranes and unbroken cells, and portions of each supernatant were used for immunoprecipitations. Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 8–16% minigels (Novex) unless otherwise noted. NuPAGE gels (Novex) were run using the MOPS buffer recommended by the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized using a Fuji BAS 2500 phosphorimager. We previously found that depleting ∼95% of the SecA from E. coli completely blocks the export of AP and ribose-binding protein, two periplasmic proteins, but less severely impairs the export of OmpA, an OMP (27Qi H.-Y. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8993-8997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To determine whether the fate of a protein in SecA-deficient cells correlates with its intracellular destination, we analyzed the export of a larger set of proteins after SecA depletion. BA13 (secA13amsupFts) and control DO251 (secA+ supFts) cells were grown at 30 °C and the cultures were shifted to 41 °C for 3 h to inactivate the amber suppressor and deplete almost all of the SecA. As previously observed (27Qi H.-Y. Bernstein H.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8993-8997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), BA13 grew as well as DO251 during the SecA depletion phase (data not shown). Cells were then pulse-labeled and incubated for variable chase periods, and the export of individual proteins was analyzed by immunoprecipitation. The accumulation of the unprocessed precursor form of a protein indicated an export block. In BA13 cells, only the precursors of the periplasmic proteins AP, Bla, DegP, ribose-binding protein, and MBP were detected even after a 30-min chase (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). Most of the precursors were stable or degraded slowly during the chase period. By contrast, between ∼10 and 50% of the newly synthesized OmpA, OmpC, OmpF, and LamB molecules were exported within 2 min. A larger fraction of each protein was converted to the mature form after a 10-min chase, and the export of LamB continued even longer. As expected, all of the proteins were completely exported from DO251 cells within 2 min (Fig. 1, lanes 4–6). These results demonstrate that SecA depletion differentially affects the export of periplasmic proteins and OMPs, two biochemically distinct classes of proteins. The observation that OMPs are selectively exported after SecA depletion suggested that either they can be translocated across the IM via a SecA-independent mechanism or that they require much less SecA to traverse the IM than periplasmic proteins. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we depleted most of the SecA from BA13 cells as described above and then inhibited the activity of the residual protein by adding sodium azide. We expected that the SecA inhibitor would affect the fate of OMPs only if their export remains SecA-dependent. Interestingly, the translocation of both OmpA and OmpC was completely abolished by the addition of azide; only the precursor form of both proteins was observed even after a 30-min chase (Fig. 2, lanes 1–3). Consistent with previous results indicating that azide is a relatively weak inhibitor of SecA activity (36Oliver D.B. Cabelli R.J. Dolan K.M. Jarosik G.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8227-8231Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), the export of OmpA and OmpC was only delayed or slightly inhibited in azide-treated DO251 cells (Fig. 2,lanes 4–6). Thus, it is unlikely that the complete translocation block observed in BA13 cells was due to a nonspecific toxic effect of the azide. These results strongly suggest that OMP export is strictly dependent on the availability of at least a low concentration of SecA. To identify the structural features of OMPs that explain their continued export after SecA depletion, we constructed a variety of plasmids that produce deleted or modified forms of pro-OmpA (Fig. 3 A). BA13 and DO251 were transformed with each plasmid and the export of the pro-OmpA derivative was examined after SecA depletion. Initial experiments demonstrated that only the first two-thirds of the protein, which consists of the 170-amino acid β-barrel domain and about 60 amino acids of the C-terminal periplasmic domain, are required for translocation. In BA13 cells nearly 50% of a pro-OmpA derivative that lacked the last ∼100 amino acids (pro-OmpA(Δ2)) was exported within 2 min (Fig. 3,A and B, top panel, lane 1). OmpA(Δ2) was relatively unstable in both BA13 and DO251 and was degraded more rapidly than untranslocated pro-OmpA(Δ2) (Fig. 3 B, top panel). These observations confirmed that cleavage of the precursor in SecA-depleted cells was due to transport across the IM. In light of evidence that SecA binds to the N terminus of presecretory proteins and then promotes the transport of successive 20-amino acid segments, it is conceivable that OMPs are selectively exported in SecA-limited cells because SecA binds with particularly high affinity to their signal peptides. This explanation is unlikely, however, because replacement of the pro-OmpA signal peptide with the AP signal peptide did not abolish translocation of the protein after SecA depletion (Fig. 3, A and B, second panel). Moreover, no export of pro-OmpA(Δ3), which contains the entire N-terminal β-barrel domain, was observed (Fig. 3, Aand B, third panel). Thus, it is unlikely that SecA preferentially associates with any sequence near the N terminus of the protein. Because pro-OmpA variants containing a deletion in the β-barrel domain (pro-OmpA(Δ1)) or a double point mutation (pro-OmpA*) that abolishes β-barrel formation (37Klose M. MacIntyre S. Schwarz H. Henning U. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13297-13302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were exported in SecA-deficient cells (Fig. 3 A), translocation was not contingent on the ability of the protein to form a β-barrel. Complete deletion of the β-barrel domain, however, created unstable variants that appeared to remain in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Taken together, the results of the mutational analysis suggest that both a significant portion of the β-barrel domain and the first 60 amino acids of the periplasmic domain of pro-OmpA are required for export after SecA depletion. Interestingly, experiments with OmpA-AP fusions revealed that periplasmic proteins can be exported in SecA-limited cells when linked covalently to OmpA. BA13 and DO251 were transformed with a plasmid containing an AP domain fused to either pro-OmpA(Δ2) or a slightly truncated version of pro-OmpA(Δ3), and SecA was depleted as described above. The export properties of each fusion protein correlated with those of the corresponding pro-OmpA deletion mutant. About half of the pro-OmpA(Δ2)-AP was transported across the IM after SecA depletion, whereas all of the pro-OmpA(Δ3)-AP was retained in the cytoplasm even after a long chase (Fig. 3, A and B, fourth and fifth panels). The observation that OmpA(Δ2)-AP was stable in BA13 cells (unlike the precursor form of the protein) suggested that it was properly translocated across the IM. Taken together, the results indicate that the quantitative block of periplasmic protein export observed after SecA depletion is not due to the presence of sequence or structural elements that hinder translocation across the IM when SecA is limiting. Because the pattern of OMP and periplasmic protein translocation after SecA depletion could not be easily attributed to differences in SecA binding affinity, it is likely that the fate of the two classes of proteins diverged during or prior to targeting. Given that OMP export was observed over a period of at least several minutes, the simplest interpretation of the data is that OMPs were released from ribosomes and remained in a conformation in which they are competent both for interaction with SecA and for transport across the IM. It is formally possible, however, that a fraction of each OMP was rapidly targeted to the IM as translationally arrested nascent chains that were completed only after translocation began. To distinguish between these two explanations, SecA was depleted from BA13, and translation elongation was inhibited by the addition of chloramphenicol 1 min after pulse labeling. The same amount of OmpA was exported from chloramphenicol-treated cells and untreated control cells (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3). These results indicate that pro-OmpA is translocated post-translationally, and suggest that fully synthesized polypeptide chains persist in the cytoplasm until they encounter a SecA molecule. Because tightly folded proteins cannot be transported across the IM by the Sec machinery, it is likely that a molecular chaperone is required to preserve OMPs in a loosely folded conformation after SecA depletion. A reasonable candidate is SecB, the chaperone that targets most OMPs to the IM under normal growth conditions. Available evidence suggests, however, that SecB promotes OMP export only very early after protein synthesis is complete. Within less than a minute, alternative targeting mechanisms begin to compensate for the loss of SecB, and as a result OMP export is merely delayed in secB− strains (see, for example, Refs. 9Wild J. Altman E. Yura T. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Wild J. Rossmeissl P. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3608-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, and 38Guthrie B. Wickner W. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 5555-5562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 5 A, lanes 4–6). Moreover, SecB normally targets a subset of periplasmic proteins such as MBP that are not translocated after SecA depletion. Thus, protein export in SecA-deficient cells cannot merely be a consequence of interaction with SecB. To directly examine the role of SecB in the export of OMPs after SecA depletion, we constructed secB−derivatives of BA13 and DO251 (HDB108 and HDB109, respectively) and incubated the cells at high temperature. Although the lack of SecB slowed the rate of export, about the same amount of OmpA was eventually exported in HDB108 as in BA13 (Fig. 5 A, lanes 1–3). These data suggest that a chaperone other than SecB preserves the export competence of OMPs in SecA-deficient cells. The first evidence that OMP export in SecA-deficient cells is promoted by DnaK emerged from experiments with a mutant form of the chaperone. Previous studies have shown that DnaK can serve as an alternative targeting factor for at least some presecretory proteins including OmpA and LamB (9Wild J. Altman E. Yura T. Gross C.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 10Wild J. Rossmeissl P. Walter W.A. Gross C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 3608-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (92)"

During photosynthesis, plants collect sunlight and convert this into chemical energy to be conserved in ATP and NADPH (1Granick S. Harvey Lect. 1950; 44: 220-245Google Scholar). A key role in the processes of light absorption and energy transduction is played by the light-harvesting complexes, in particular two light-harvesting chlorophylla/b-protein complexes termed LHCI1 and LHCII (2Ort D.T. Yocum C.F. Oxygenic Photosynthesis: The Light Reactions. Kluwer, Dordrecht1996Crossref Google Scholar). LHCII is a trimer (3Dreyfuss B.W. Thornber J.P. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 829-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) that operates as the basic antenna to provide the reaction center of photosystem II with excitation energy (4Horton P.

Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 685-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Monomeric LHCII consists of 232 amino acids that form three α-helices embedded into the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast (6Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar), the site of photosynthesis. Twelve chlorophylls (Chls) (seven Chl a and five Chl bmolecules) and two carotenoids (luteins) are bound per LHCII molecule (6Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). In the center of the complex, Chl b is in close contact with Chl a for rapid energy transfer and with the carotenoids that prevent the formation of toxic singlet oxygen (6Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1525) Google Scholar). Energy transfer from Chl b to the closely related Chla (both compounds differ only in a formyl group instead of a methyl group at the 7-position in the chlorin ring of Chl a) (for a review, see Ref. 7von Wettstein D. Gough S. Kannangara C.G. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1039-1057Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar) can take place because of the different energy contents and decay times of their excited states (8Eads D.D. Castner E.W.

A similar principle of energy transfer has been proposed for the prolamellar body of etioplasts (11Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Prolamellar bodies are paracrystalline structures that are present in etiolated plants (12Virgin H.I. Kahn A. von Wettstein D. Photochem.

We repeatedly observed that Pchlide b present in the native and in vitro-reconstituted complexes was not photoconvertible in the first place and that only Pchlide a was reduced to Chlidea (13Reinbothe C.

In addition to the pigment substrates NADPH and Pchlide, native LHPP is presumed to contain galacto- and sulfolipids (11Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 13Reinbothe C. Buhr F. Pollmann S. Reinbothe S. J. Biol.

In our recentin vitro reconstitution experiments, the lipids shifted the spectral properties of the complex from around 630 to 650 nm (11Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S.

Hereby an overlap was established to the action spectrum of phytochrome-dependent regulation of hypocotyl elongation observed in vivo (20Neff M.M. Fankhauser C. Chory J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 257-271PubMed Google Scholar, 21Quail P.H. Boylan M.T. Parks B.M. Short T.W., Xu, Y. Wagner D. Science. 1995; 268: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The complex molecular architecture of LHPP and particularly the fact that it contains two closely related POR proteins, which must bind and properly interact with their cognate substrates in order to be operative during Chl a biosynthesis, put tremendous constraints on the assembly pathway of LHPP. Initial studies suggested that the substrate-dependent import of the cytosolic precursor of the PORA into the plastids might be a mechanism to provide assembly-competent PORA-Pchlide (b)-NADPH complexes (22Reinbothe S. Runge S. Reinbothe C. van Cleve B. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Runge S. Apel K. J.

A. 1997; 94: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Also PORB seemed to interact with Pchlide, presumably Pchlidea, but this interaction was likely to take place only after translocation (24Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Holtorf H. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Import per se was Pchlide-independent (24Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Holtorf H. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Apel K. Reinbothe S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Where and when PORA-Pchlide b-NADPH and PORB-Pchlidea-NADPH ternary complexes interact with each other during the establishment of LHPP is unknown; nor has it been determined which structural elements in the PORA and PORB polypeptides are essential for their oligomerization. As a first step to investigate the assembly pathway of LHPP, we genetically deleted the extra sequence that distinguishes PORA and PORB from the structurally related short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases (26Baker M.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Wilks H. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Birve S.J. Selstam E. Johansson L.B.-A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). As shown by in organelloand in vitro studies, this deletion in either case had no effect on the import of the cytosolic POR precursors into the plastids, their binding to Pchlide, and the stability of the imported, mature PORA and PORB proteins inside the organelles. However, either truncation completely abolished the assembly of LHPP in vitro. Primer sequences were as follows: primer 1, 5′-AACTGCAGATGGGCAAGAAGACGCTGCGGCAG-3′; primer 2, 5′-AACTGCAGGGTGGATCATAGTCCGACGAGCTT-3′; primer 3, 5′-AACTGCAGATGGGCAAGAAGACTGTCCGCACG-3′; primer 4, 5′-AACTGCAGTGATCATGCGAGCCCGACGAGCTT-3′; primer 5, 5′-TTTGCCCATGGTAATGGAGCCGAC-GATGACCAT-3′; primer 6, 5′-AAAACCATGGGCGACGAGAGCTTCGACGGCGCC-3′; primer 7, 5′-TTTGCCCATGGTAATGGAGCCGACGATGATGAG-3′; primer 8, 5′-AAAACCATGGGCGCGGAGTTCGACGGCGCCAAG-3′. cDNA clones MatA1.1 and MatB1.1, encoding the mature PORA and PORB polypeptides lacking their NH2-terminal transit peptides for import into chloroplasts, were generated by a polymerase chain reaction-based approach (29Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1990Google Scholar), using primers 1 plus 2 and primers 3 plus 4, in combination with clones A7 (30Schulz R. Steinmüller K. Klaas M. Forreiter C. Rasmussen S. Hiller C. Apel K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 217: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and L2 (31Holtorf H. Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Bereza B. Apel K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), respectively, as templates. cDNA clones MatΔA1.1 and MatΔB1.1, encoding truncated PORA (ΔPORA) and PORB (ΔPORB) molecules, respectively, were produced identically but with two additional primer combinations: primers 1 and 5 plus primers 2 and 6 (pMatΔA1.1) and primers 3 and 7 plus primers 4 and 8 (pMatΔB1.1), respectively. For construction of cDNA clones encoding full-length PORA and PORB precursors lacking the extra loop (i.e.ΔpPORA and ΔpPORB), clones MatΔA1.1 and MatΔB1.1 were treated with BamHI (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar) and annealed with PCR-derivedBamHI-cut fragments encoding transA and transB (the transit peptides of the pPORA and pPORB, respectively), which had been amplified as described (25Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Apel K. Reinbothe S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The identity of all of the different clones was confirmed by DNA sequencing, using the gel system described in Ref. 33Sanger F. Nickler S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar. Cell-free protein synthesis was performed in a hand-made or TNT wheat germ-coupledin vitro transcription/translation system (Promega GmbH, Mannheim, Germany), according to the manufacturer's instructions (see also Ref. 34Krieg P.A. Melton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 7057-7070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Precursors to be used for studying protein import were denatured with 8 m urea and diluted to a final 0.2m urea concentration immediately before use. Protein import was studied as described previously (22Reinbothe S. Runge S. Reinbothe C. van Cleve B. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Reinbothe S.

Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, chloroplasts were isolated from 5-day-old, light-grown plants by differential centrifugation and Percoll density gradient centrifugation and further purified on Percoll cushions. Import assays contained 7.5 μl of complete pre-mix consisting of 25 μl of doubly concentrated, ATP-free import buffer (22Reinbothe S. Runge S. Reinbothe C. van Cleve B. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), 2 μl of a 125 mm stock solution of Mg-ATP, pH 7.0, 10 μl of the indicated radiolabeled, urea-denatured precursors, 3 μl of double-distilled water, and 0.5 μl of either a 10 mm stock solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) prepared in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, or phosphate buffer alone. The import reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 μl of the purified plastids (1 × 107), and five samples were run and analyzed in parallel for each of the different precursors. One assay was immediately stopped by the addition of a doubly concentrated SDS sample buffer (see below), while the remaining four samples were incubated at 23 °C in complete darkness for 15 min. Two of the latter four samples contained phosphate-buffered 5-ALA, whereas the other two contained only phosphate buffer. In either case, one each of the different samples was treated with thermolysin after the incubation (35Cline K. Werner-Washburne M. Andrews J. Keegstra K. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 675-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the other was left untreated. Postimport incubations were performed with protease-treated plastids recovered from the import mixtures by centrifugation on Percoll, at 23 °C for 30 min either in darkness or white light. After the addition of an equal volume of doubly concentrated SDS-sample buffer (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and boiling the samples for 2 min, protein was analyzed electrophoretically and detected by autoradiography (see below). [35S]Methionine-labeled PORA, PORB, ΔPORA, and ΔPORB molecules were synthesized by coupled in vitro transcription/translation of the recombinant clones described above and resolved by SDS-PAGE (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis and autoradiography, the radioactivity bands were cut out and counted in a liquid scintillation counter. After correcting the incorporation rates for the different methionine contents, equal amounts of the different proteins were supplemented with 0.5 mm NADPH and incubated with either chemically synthesized Pchlide a and Pchlide b or their zinc counterparts, ZnPPa and ZnPPb, respectively (37Schoch S. Helfrich M. Wiktorsson B. Sundqvist C. Rüdiger W. Ryberg M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 38Scheumann V. Klement H. Helfrich M. Oster U. Schoch S. Rüdiger W. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), each added to 10 μm final concentrations to the assays (22Reinbothe S. Runge S. Reinbothe C. van Cleve B. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). POR-pigment-NADPH complexes formed during a 15-min dark incubation were depleted of non-protein-bound pigments by gel filtration on Sephadex G15, as described (22Reinbothe S. Runge S. Reinbothe C. van Cleve B. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and were then either kept in darkness or illuminated with white light for 15 min. Enzymatic product formation occurring during this preillumination was measured fluorimetrically using acetone-extracted pigments. Protease treatment of reconstituted POR-pigment-NADPH complexes was performed as described previously (24Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Holtorf H. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) but in incubation mixtures containing 7.5 μl of doubly concentrated assay buffer (22Reinbothe S. Runge S. Reinbothe C. van Cleve B. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), 1 μl of a 25 mm stock solution of Mg-ATP, pH 7.0, 5 μl of a plastid protease mixture prepared from barley chloroplasts (39Reinbothe C. Apel K. Reinbothe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6206-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and 1.5 μl of double-distilled water. After a 15-min incubation in the dark, the assays were terminated by the addition of 1 μl of a mixture containing 10 μg ml−1 antipain and 1 μg ml−1 pepstatin, which efficiently block the POR-degrading stromal protease (39Reinbothe C. Apel K. Reinbothe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6206-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Different amounts of gel-filtered PORA-Pchlide (ZnPP) b-NADPH, ΔPORA-Pchlide (ZnPP)b-NADPH, PORB-Pchlide (ZnPP) a-NADPH, and ΔPORB-Pchlide (ZnPP) a-NADPH complexes were mixed in the combinations given herein and incubated in the dark for 15 min. Then one aliquot of the reaction mixtures was immediately precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (11Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Reinbothe S. Nature. 1999; 397: 80-84Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Another aliquot was subjected to gel filtration on Sephadex G100 or Superose 6 (Amersham Biosciences). Individual fractions were harvested, and aliquots were taken for radioactivity measurements in a liquid scintillation counter. Pooled fractions were then treated with trichloroacetic acid as described above and processed with acetone, ethanol, and diethyl ether; and protein was resolved on 10–20% polyacrylamide gradients containing SDS (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The gel in Fig. 1 B shows a separation on a 5–15% polyacrylamide gradient containing SDS. After electrophoresis,35S-labeled PORA-PORB higher molecular weight complexes and nonassembled 35S-PORA and 35S-PORB were visualized by autoradiography. NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (EC 1.3.33.1) belongs to the family of short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases (26Baker M.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 605-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 27Wilks H. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 28Birve S.J. Selstam E. Johansson L.B.-A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). All plant POR proteins characterized thus far, including the PORA and PORB of barley used in this study, are conserved in their length, primary amino acid sequence, and active site residues (27Wilks H. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 40Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 237: 323-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 41Suzuki J.Y. Bauer C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 15-19Google Scholar). However, they differ from each other and the related short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases in possessing variable NH2-terminal extensions, referred to as transit peptides, which are required for their post-translational transport into the plastids. Another striking difference is the occurrence of a short stretch of hydrophobic amino acids in the central region of the polypeptide (Fig. 1 A), which distinguishes POR from members of the alcohol dehydrogenase family, comprising 3α,20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and dihydropteridine reductase (42Ghosh D. Weeks C.M. Grochulski P. Duax W.L. Erman M. Rimsay R.L. Orr J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10064-10068Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 43Varughese K.L. Skinner M.M. Whitley J.M. Matthews D.A. Xuong N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6080-6084Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Wilks and Timko (27Wilks H. Timko M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 724-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) proposed that this so-called “extra loop” may be involved in substrate binding, subunit-subunit interaction, or membrane association. In addition, an involvement in protein import and postimport stabilization of the imported, mature proteins could not be excluded. To test these different possibilities, truncated precursor PORA (ΔpPORA) and precursor PORB (ΔpPORB) molecules, which lacked amino acids 217–252 and 225–260, respectively, representing the extra loop (Fig. 1 A), were generated by a polymerase chain reaction-based approach (see “Materials and Methods”). Subsequently, the resulting recombinant clones were used for in vitro transcription/translation in the presence of [35S]methionine (Fig. 1 B). As a control to the truncated precursors, the authentic, in vitro synthesized pPORA and pPORB were used (Fig. 1, A and B). Mature PORA and PORB polypeptides containing or lacking the extra loop were produced in parallel (Fig. 1 C). The various radiolabeled precursors were denatured with urea (see “Materials and Methods”) and added to barley chloroplasts that had been isolated from light-grown plants. Then the mixtures were incubated for 15 min in the dark with either 5-ALA dissolved in phosphate buffer or phosphate buffer alone. After this incubation, half of the assays were treated with thermolysin, whereas the other halves were left untreated. When import of the authentic and truncated pPORA was compared, no difference could be seen for 5-ALA-incubated, Pchlide-containing chloroplasts (Fig. 2 A). In case of the truncated pPORB, a slight drop of import was detectable as compared with the authentic precursor (Fig. 2 A). Precursor molecules that had not been imported were degraded during postimport thermolysin treatment (Fig. 2 A, + 5-ALA; compare − Thl and + Thl). In the case of chloroplasts that lacked the 5-ALA-derived Pchlide, no import of the pPORA and its ΔpPORA derivative was detectable (Fig. 2 A). Consistent with previous results (22Reinbothe S. Runge S. Reinbothe C. van Cleve B. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 23Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Runge S. Apel K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 24Reinbothe S. Reinbothe C. Holtorf H. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 25Reinbothe C. Lebedev N. Apel K. Reinbothe S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8890-8894Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the precursor in either case remained quantitatively unchanged after the incubation. It was rapidly degraded during subsequent thermolysin treatment (Fig. 2 A, − 5-ALA; compare −Thl and + Thl). By contrast, import of the pPORB and its ΔpPORB derivative into Pchlide-free chloroplasts was very possible and did not require exogenous 5-ALA (Fig. 2 A, compare + 5-ALA and − 5-ALA). We next asked whether the extra loop distinguishing the PORA and PORB from the related alcohol dehydrogenases might affect the stability of the imported and processed proteins. Replicate plastid samples, which had been treated with thermolysin after import, were repurified on Percoll and subsequently incubated at 23 °C either in white light or darkness for an additional 30-min period. Fig. 2 B shows that postimport incubations in darkness had no effect on the stability of the imported and processed enzymes. In all cases, identical levels of the mature POR proteins were maintained. When the samples were illuminated, all imported POR proteins rapidly vanished, however (Fig. 2 C). Most likely as a result of light-induced chlorophyllide formation (39Reinbothe C. Apel K. Reinbothe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6206-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the different imported proteins were degraded by plastid proteases (Fig. 2, compareB and C). We next determined the turnover rates of in vitro-reconstituted POR-pigment complexes, using a stromal protease isolated from barley chloroplasts (39Reinbothe C. Apel K. Reinbothe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6206-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We assumed that this type of assay might unveil minor differences in the stability of the truncated and nontruncated POR proteins. Mature PORA and PORB polypeptides lacking both their extra loops and chloroplast transit peptides were produced as described in the legend to Fig. 1 Cand purified by glycerol gradient centrifugation. Then equal amounts of the two truncated and two authentic POR polypeptides were reconstituted into (Δ)POR-pigment-NADPH complexes (22Reinbothe S. Runge S. Reinbothe C. van Cleve B. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). PORA and ΔPORA were incubated for 15 min in the dark with Pchlide b and NADPH, whereas PORB and ΔPORB were supplemented with Pchlide aand NADPH, respectively. After a subsequent step of gel filtration on Sephadex G15 to remove non-protein-bound pigments, the fluorescence properties of the recovered (Δ)POR-Pchlide-NADPH ternary complexes were determined in acetone (22Reinbothe S. Runge S. Reinbothe C. van Cleve B. Apel K. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). When the levels of PORA- and ΔPORA-bound Pchlide b were compared, almost no difference was observed; PORA and ΔPORA bound practically indistinguishable amounts of the pigment (Fig. 3 A, solid versus dashed line, respectively). Similar results were obtained for the PORB and ΔPORB, which bound almost the same levels of Pchlide a (Fig. 3 B,solid and dashed line, respectively). Exposing the different samples to white light in all cases caused enzymatic chlorophyllide formation (data not shown, but see accompanying paper (13Reinbothe C. Buhr F. Pollmann S. Reinbothe S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 807-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)), demonstrating that the ΔPORA and ΔPORB polypeptides were enzymatically active. As a next step, we tested the stability of the reconstituted POR-Pchlide-NADPH and POR-chlorophyllide-NADP+ ternary complexes. As a control to the pigment-complexed proteins, the naked ΔPORA, PORA, ΔPORB, and PORB polypeptides were used. Then a stromal protease that had been prepared from barley chloroplasts (39Reinbothe C. Apel K. Reinbothe S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6206-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was added. After various time intervals, aliquots were taken and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 4 shows time courses of the amount of the PORA and PORB and their ΔPORA and ΔPORB derivatives. In the presence of their cognate substrates, all four proteins wer"
