https://openalex.org/W2027753197,"Brown fat generates heat via the mitochondrial uncoupling protein UCP1, defending against hypothermia and obesity. Recent data suggest that there are two distinct types of brown fat: classical brown fat derived from a myf-5 cellular lineage and UCP1-positive cells that emerge in white fat from a non-myf-5 lineage. Here, we report the isolation of ""beige"" cells from murine white fat depots. Beige cells resemble white fat cells in having extremely low basal expression of UCP1, but, like classical brown fat, they respond to cyclic AMP stimulation with high UCP1 expression and respiration rates. Beige cells have a gene expression pattern distinct from either white or brown fat and are preferentially sensitive to the polypeptide hormone irisin. Finally, we provide evidence that previously identified brown fat deposits in adult humans are composed of beige adipocytes. These data provide a foundation for studying this mammalian cell type with therapeutic potential. PAPERCLIP:"
https://openalex.org/W2075994330,"Striatal dopamine plays key roles in our normal and pathological goal-directed actions. To understand dopamine function, much attention has focused on how midbrain dopamine neurons modulate their firing patterns. However, we identify a presynaptic mechanism that triggers dopamine release directly, bypassing activity in dopamine neurons. We paired electrophysiological recordings of striatal channelrhodopsin2-expressing cholinergic interneurons with simultaneous detection of dopamine release at carbon-fiber microelectrodes in striatal slices. We reveal that activation of cholinergic interneurons by light flashes that cause only single action potentials in neurons from a small population triggers dopamine release via activation of nicotinic receptors on dopamine axons. This event overrides ascending activity from dopamine neurons and, furthermore, is reproduced by activating ChR2-expressing thalamostriatal inputs, which synchronize cholinergic interneurons in vivo. These findings indicate that synchronized activity in cholinergic interneurons directly generates striatal dopamine signals whose functions will extend beyond those encoded by dopamine neuron activity."
https://openalex.org/W2090075044,"Memory enables flexible use of past experience to inform new behaviors. Although leading theories hypothesize that this fundamental flexibility results from the formation of integrated memory networks relating multiple experiences, the neural mechanisms that support memory integration are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that retrieval-mediated learning, whereby prior event details are reinstated during encoding of related experiences, supports participants' ability to infer relationships between distinct events that share content. Furthermore, we show that activation changes in a functionally coupled hippocampal and ventral medial prefrontal cortical circuit track the formation of integrated memories and successful inferential memory performance. These findings characterize the respective roles of these regions in retrieval-mediated learning processes that support relational memory network formation and inferential memory in the human brain. More broadly, these data reveal fundamental mechanisms through which memory representations are constructed into prospectively useful formats."
https://openalex.org/W2067326892,"Recent findings indicate that specific microRNAs (miRNAs), such as those of the miR-17-92 cluster, may be responsible for regulating endothelial gene expression during tumor angiogenesis. Secreted miRNAs enclosed in exosomes also have an important role in cell–cell communication. To elucidate whether miRNAs secreted from neoplastic cells transfer into endothelial cells and are functionally active in the recipient cells, we investigated the effect of exosomal miRNAs derived from leukemia cells (K562) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). As K562 cells released the miR-17-92 cluster, especially miR-92a, into the extracellular environment, K562 cells, transfected with Cy3-labeled pre-miR-92a, were co-cultured with HUVECs. Cy3-miR-92a derived from K562 cells was detected in the cytoplasm of HUVECs, and the Cy3-miR-92a co-localized with the signals of an exosomal marker, CD63. The expression of integrin α5, a target gene for miR-92a, was significantly reduced in HUVECs by exosomal miR-92a, indicating that exogenous miRNA via exosomal transport can function like endogenous miRNA in HUVECs. The most salient feature of this study is the exosome, derived from K562 cells with enforced miR-92a expression, did not affect the growth of HUVECs but did enhance endothelial cell migration and tube formation. Our results support the idea that exosomal miRNAs have an important role in neoplasia-to-endothelial cell communication."

To gain a systems-level view of the Htt interactome, we applied Weighted Correlation Network Analysis to the entire proteomic data set to unveil a verifiable rank of Htt-correlated proteins and a network of Htt-interacting protein modules, with each module highlighting distinct aspects of Htt biology. Importantly, the Htt-containing module is highly enriched with proteins involved in 14-3-3 signaling, microtubule-based transport, and proteostasis. Top-ranked proteins in this module were validated as Htt interactors and genetic modifiers in an HD Drosophila model. Our study provides a compendium of spatiotemporal Htt-interacting proteins in the mammalian brain and presents an approach for analyzing proteomic interactome data sets to build in vivo protein networks in complex tissues, such as the brain.Video AbstracteyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiJmOWJkMjBmYzY0ZDVlYTFiNTRhZjM4NTk5MDg4ZjcyOSIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc4MDEwNTg3fQ.RGp8ZBnaBqggP6FaHi6TPwRKWzHsL_TnK8ESZ6ocnsFaNH6jC3rt9QINrN2BtD8Ln-NwgF1ZNrKTqwqlfx8regEXBarkBJFIDT7VU-RkkNM-7mHsdHOuyUnV5K6_U9ajWjYeTSyb0tjeIUQuTIFXbtPfCwO0bEu1Ax1PSWguY8AdSvyBksCDxDv_9CHddVcVC8sqS1QYyDxW_ndgLnqglSy6dpyYTDH5FhnpM4guoRD4uCuNmiPFEfVIm7IhzpIVP3WoKHMeaInMbmAbtG1mEeHvB8IbIQ_alMF8o8yfTHds3snea6Vqo0NBgiiwYjeu5L3G8knoNG9gkDNplw8y7A(mp4, (19.51 MB) Download video"
https://openalex.org/W1989006812,"Human altruism shaped our evolutionary history and pervades social and political life. There are, however, enormous individual differences in altruism. Some people are almost completely selfish, while others display strong altruism, and the factors behind this heterogeneity are only poorly understood. We examine the neuroanatomical basis of these differences with voxel-based morphometry and show that gray matter (GM) volume in the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is strongly associated with both individuals' altruism and the individual-specific conditions under which this brain region is recruited during altruistic decision making. Thus, individual differences in GM volume in TPJ not only translate into individual differences in the general propensity to behave altruistically, but they also create a link between brain structure and brain function by indicating the conditions under which individuals are likely to recruit this region when they face a conflict between altruistic and selfish acts."
https://openalex.org/W2113714901,"Within vertebrates, major sex determining genes can differ among taxa and even within species. In zebrafish (Danio rerio), neither heteromorphic sex chromosomes nor single sex determination genes of large effect, like Sry in mammals, have yet been identified. Furthermore, environmental factors can influence zebrafish sex determination. Although progress has been made in understanding zebrafish gonad differentiation (e.g. the influence of germ cells on gonad fate), the primary genetic basis of zebrafish sex determination remains poorly understood. To identify genetic loci associated with sex, we analyzed F(2) offspring of reciprocal crosses between Oregon *AB and Nadia (NA) wild-type zebrafish stocks. Genome-wide linkage analysis, using more than 5,000 sequence-based polymorphic restriction site associated (RAD-tag) markers and population genomic analysis of more than 30,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in our *ABxNA crosses revealed a sex-associated locus on the end of the long arm of chr-4 for both cross families, and an additional locus in the middle of chr-3 in one cross family. Additional sequencing showed that two SNPs in dmrt1 previously suggested to be functional candidates for sex determination in a cross of ABxIndia wild-type zebrafish, are not associated with sex in our AB fish. Our data show that sex determination in zebrafish is polygenic and that different genes may influence sex determination in different strains or that different genes become more important under different environmental conditions. The association of the end of chr-4 with sex is remarkable because, unique in the karyotype, this chromosome arm shares features with known sex chromosomes: it is highly heterochromatic, repetitive, late replicating, and has reduced recombination. Our results reveal that chr-4 has functional and structural properties expected of a sex chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2143237238,"Our visual system segments images into objects and background. Figure-ground segregation relies on the detection of feature discontinuities that signal boundaries between the figures and the background and on a complementary region-filling process that groups together image regions with similar features. The neuronal mechanisms for these processes are not well understood and it is unknown how they depend on visual attention. We measured neuronal activity in V1 and V4 in a task where monkeys either made an eye movement to texture-defined figures or ignored them. V1 activity predicted the timing and the direction of the saccade if the figures were task relevant. We found that boundary detection is an early process that depends little on attention, whereas region filling occurs later and is facilitated by visual attention, which acts in an object-based manner. Our findings are explained by a model with local, bottom-up computations for boundary detection and feedback processing for region filling.

Figure-ground segregation relies on boundary detection and region filling Boundary detection in V1 and V4 is automatic; region filling depends on attention Figure-ground segregation signals in V1, V4 predict speed and accuracy of saccades Intra-areal and feedback interactions have unique roles in figure-ground segregation Visual perception starts in early visual areas with the detection of elementary features like the orientation and color of image elements by neurons with small receptive fields. This piecemeal analysis is very different from our subjective perception. We perceive objects composed of many features that activate large, distributed neuronal populations in visual cortex. Our visual system reconstructs objects from these distributed representations by grouping the image elements of objects and by segregating them from the background. A neural correlate of this reconstruction process is observed in the primary visual cortex (area V1), where neurons enhance their response when their receptive field (RF) is on a figure compared to when it is on the background, an effect known as figure-ground modulation (FGM) (Lamme, 1995Lamme V.A. The neurophysiology of figure-ground segregation in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 1605-1615PubMed Google Scholar, Marcus and Van Essen, 2002Marcus D.S. Van Essen D.C.

Schiller P.H. Contextual modulation in primary visual cortex.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7376-7389PubMed Google Scholar). FGM labels image elements of a figure with enhanced activity so that they are grouped in perception (Roelfsema, 2006Roelfsema P.R. Cortical algorithms for perceptual grouping.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 29: 203-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, Roelfsema and Houtkamp, 2011Roelfsema P.R. Houtkamp R. Incremental grouping of image elements in vision.Atten. Percept. Psychophys. 2011; 73: 2542-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the neural mechanisms for FGM is limited. It is unknown if this signal depends on interactions within V1 or whether it reflects an interaction between V1 and higher visual areas. Furthermore, it is unclear if the labeling process occurs for all figures, or only for those that are relevant for behavior. Finally, the functional role of these contextual influences in V1 is not well understood. How is the pattern of FGM reflected in behavior? We wished to elucidate the neuronal interactions that give rise to FGM. Previous neurocomputational models have proposed two complementary mechanisms for the segregation of a figure from the background (Mumford et al., 1987Mumford D. Kosslyn S.M. Hillger L.A. Herrnstein R.J. Discriminating figure from ground: the role of edge detection and region growing.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1987; 84: 7354-7358Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The first “boundary-detection” mechanism detects abrupt changes in features at locations where figures and background abut and the second “region-filling” mechanism joins similar image elements into larger figural regions (Ullman, 1984Ullman S. Visual routines.Cognition. 1984; 18: 97-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). These two processes give rise to apparently conflicting constraints on the neuronal connectivity (Grossberg and Mingolla, 1985Grossberg S. Mingolla E. Neural dynamics of form perception: boundary completion, illusory figures, and neon color spreading.Psychol. Rev. 1985; 92: 173-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, Roelfsema et al., 2002Roelfsema P.R. Lamme V.A. Spekreijse H. Bosch H. Figure-ground segregation in a recurrent network architecture.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2002; 14: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). On the one hand, algorithms for boundary detection use inhibition between neurons with nearby RFs tuned to the same feature (Grossberg and Mingolla, 1985Grossberg S. Mingolla E. Neural dynamics of form perception: boundary completion, illusory figures, and neon color spreading.Psychol. Rev. 1985; 92: 173-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar, Itti and Koch, 2001Itti L. Koch C. Computational modelling of visual attention.Nat. Rev.

USA. 1999; 96: 10530-10535Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Neurons with RFs in the middle of a homogenous region receive strong inhibition from their neighbors so that their activity is weak, whereas neurons with RFs at boundaries receive less inhibition so that their activity is stronger (Figure 1A , left). Algorithms for region filling, on the other hand, require that neurons tuned to similar features excite each other. If the representation of some of the figural image elements is enhanced, the excitatory connections spread the enhanced activity to neurons with a similar feature preference, coding elements of the same figure. A number of previous studies supported separate mechanisms for FGM at the figure boundary (edge modulation) and figure center (center modulation) (Huang and Paradiso, 2008Huang X. Paradiso M.A. V1 response timing and surface filling-in.J. Neurophysiol. 2008; 100: 539-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, Lamme et al., 1998aLamme V.A. Supèr H. Spekreijse H.

Feedforward and recurrent processing in scene segmentation: electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging.J. Cogn. Neurosci. 2008; 20: 2097-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), but other studies disputed the existence of the region-filling process within V1 (Rossi et al., 2001Rossi A.F. Desimone R.

V1 mechanisms and some figure-ground and border effects.J. Physiol. Paris. 2003; 97: 503-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Another unresolved but possibly related issue is the role of task-driven attention in figure-ground segregation. The Gestalt psychologists (Koffka, 1935Koffka K. Principles of Gestalt Psychology. Harcourt, Brace and Company, New York1935Google Scholar, Rubin, 1915Rubin E. Visuell wahrgenommene figuren. Glydendalske, Copenhagen1915Google Scholar, Wertheimer, 1923Wertheimer M. Untersuchungen zur Lehre von der Gestalt II.Psychol. Forsch. 1923; 4: 301-350Crossref Scopus (1356) Google Scholar) delineated several bottom-up factors for figure-ground organization. They found that small, convex, and symmetric image regions are usually perceived as figures whereas large, concave and asymmetric regions are often perceived as background (Kanizsa and Gerbino, 1976Kanizsa G. Gerbino W. Convexity and symmetry in figure-ground organization.in: Henle M. Vision and Artifact. Springer, New York1976: 25-32Google Scholar, Koffka, 1935Koffka K. Principles of Gestalt Psychology. Harcourt, Brace and Company, New York1935Google Scholar). But there is also an important influence of top-down factors (Peterson et al., 1991Peterson M.A. Harvey E.M. Weidenbacher H.J. Shape recognition contributions to figure-ground reversal: which route counts?.J. Exp. Psychol. Hum. Percept. Perform. 1991; 17: 1075-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For example, if you attend to a region of an ambiguous figure-ground display, this increases the probability that you perceive it as figure (Driver and Baylis, 1996Driver J. Baylis G.C. Edge-assignment and figure-ground segmentation in short-term visual matching.Cognit. Psychol. 1996; 31: 248-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, Vecera et al., 2004Vecera S.P. Flevaris A.V. Filapek J.C. Exogenous spatial attention influences figure-ground assignment.Psychol. Sci. 2004; 15: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). It is not known how these bottom-up and top-down factors interact with each other (Driver et al., 2001Driver J. Davis G. Russell C. Turatto M. Freeman E. Segmentation, attention and phenomenal visual objects.Cognition. 2001; 80: 61-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, Qiu et al., 2007Qiu F.T. Sugihara T. von der Heydt R. Figure-ground mechanisms provide structure for selective attention.Nat. Neurosci. 2007; 10: 1492-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, Scholl, 2001Scholl B.J. Objects and attention: the state of the art.Cognition. 2001; 80: 1-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Does top-down attention act as a spotlight (Posner et al., 1980Posner M.I. Snyder C.R. Davidson B.J. Attention and the detection of signals.J. Exp. Psychol. 1980; 109: 160-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (2661) Google Scholar) and increase neuronal activity at the approximate location of the figure or does it act in object-based manner (Duncan, 1984Duncan J. Selective attention and the organization of visual information.J. Exp. Psychol. Gen. 1984; 113: 501-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) to specifically highlight image elements of the figure, in accordance with a region-filling process (Figure 1A)? It is also not well understood how attention interacts with the boundary-detection process. Attention might enhance neuronal activity in an additive manner (Figure 1B) or selectively boost the representation of figure's interior (Figure 1C). To address these questions, we investigated neuronal activity in V1 in a texture-segregation task and also recorded simultaneously activity in V4, a higher area that is a source of feedback to V1 and is important for figure-ground segregation (Allen et al., 2009Allen H.A.

Vis. 2009; 9 (1–14): 2-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, De Weerd et al., 1994De Weerd P. Sprague J.M. Vandenbussche E. Orban G.A.

Basic visual capacities and shape discrimination after lesions of extrastriate area V4 in macaques.Vis. Neurosci. 1996; 13: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To determine the role of attention (Desimone and Duncan, 1995Desimone R. Duncan J. Neural mechanisms of selective visual attention.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (5982) Google Scholar, Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004Reynolds J.H. Chelazzi L. Attentional modulation of visual processing.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 27: 611-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, Treue, 2001Treue S. Neural correlates of attention in primate visual cortex.Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 295-300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), we required the monkeys to either attend the figures or pay attention elsewhere. We report that attention acts in an object-based manner to enhance FGM in V1 and V4. Attention is important for the V1 center modulation, but less so for V1 edge modulation, indicating that edge detection is largely preattentive, while region filling primarily occurs for figures that are relevant. We reproduced our results with a hierarchical neural network model that uses a local inhibitory intra-areal process for boundary detection and excitatory feedback from higher areas for region filling. These results therefore indicate how the cortex resolves the apparently conflicting computational constraints. In addition, the experiment reveals a functional role of FGM in area V1 in eye movement planning (Moore, 1999Moore T. Shape representations and visual guidance of saccadic eye movements.Science. 1999; 285: 1914-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, Supèr et al., 2004Supèr H. van der Togt C. Spekreijse H. Lamme V.A. Correspondence of presaccadic activity in the monkey primary visual cortex with saccadic eye movements.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 3230-3235Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The monkeys had to make precise eye movement to the figure center and the spatial profile of FGM predicted their saccadic endpoint, while the timing of V1 FGM predicted the onset of the saccade. These results imply that attention refines the representations of relevant objects in early visual areas, which makes them more useful for the guidance of behavior. We trained three monkeys to perform two tasks with identical visual stimulation (see Figure 2 and Experimental Procedures). The animals first directed their gaze to a fixation point. After 300 ms of fixation, we presented a textured background (consisting of either 45° or 135° oriented line elements) and a 4° square figure with elements of the orthogonal orientation (Figures 2A and 2B). In the hemifield opposite to the figure, we presented two white curves on top of the textured background. On alternating days, the monkeys performed different tasks: on figure-detection days they made a saccade to the center of the figure, while on curve-tracing days the figure was irrelevant and they made a saccade to a red circle at the end of the curve connected to the fixation point (Figure 2C). Their average accuracy was 98% correct in the figure-detection task and 94% in the curve-tracing task. We recorded multiunit spiking activity with chronically implanted electrode arrays (Figure S1 available online). Figure 3 shows the activity of neurons at an example V1 recording site. We placed the figure at one of 23 positions (spaced 0.5° apart) so that the RF sometimes fell on the figure center (blue in Figure 3A), on the edge of the figure (red) or on the background (black). Because of the many conditions we averaged neuronal activity across seven sessions in both tasks. Figure 3B shows the neuronal activity in the figure-detection task. It can be seen that the responses evoked by the figure-center and edge were stronger than the response evoked by the background (t test on responses 200–600 ms, both Ps < 0.05). Figure 3D shows the FGM, which was computed by subtracting the average response to the background from the single-condition responses, as a function of time and figure position. The FGM at the edges started early and the FGM at the figure-center occurred later. Figures 3C and 3E illustrates the activity at the same recording site when the monkey did not attend the figure because he carried out the curve-tracing task. The FGM at the edge positions was also observed (t test, p < 0.05), but FGM was now virtually absent for the center positions (t test, p > 0.05). These effects of attention on edge and center FGM were reproduced across a total of 59 V1 recording sites in three monkeys. In the figure-detection task, the response to the figure center and edge were enhanced relative to the background by 65% and 76%, respectively (in a window from 200–600 ms, Figure 4A ). In the curve-tracing task, the edge modulation was also strong (52% increase in the response); however, the center response fell in between the response to the edge and the response to the background (29% increase, Figure 4B). These effects were present until the time of the saccade (right panels of Figures 4A and 4B). Figures 4C and 4D show the space-time profile of FGM for attended and nonattended figures (bottom panels show responses aligned to stimulus onset, top panels responses aligned to saccade onset). Edge modulation started early, consistent with previous results (Lamme et al., 1999Lamme V.A. Rodriguez-Rodriguez V. Spekreijse H. Separate processing dynamics for texture elements, boundaries and surfaces in primary visual cortex of the macaque monkey.Cereb. Cortex. 1999; 9: 406-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, Nothdurft et al., 2000Nothdurft H.C. Gallant J.L. Van Essen D.C. Response profiles to texture border patterns in area V1.Vis. Neurosci. 2000; 17: 421-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and was followed by a gradual filling in of the figure center, but this filling-in process was only partial for unattended figures. When aligning the responses to the saccade, it becomes clear that FGM in the figure detection task ramps up until the saccade is made, at which stage all elements of the figure are labeled with an enhanced response. To investigate the reliability of these effects, we performed a repeated-measures ANOVA with factors RF position (center or edge) and task (figure detection or curve tracing), on the FGM across recording sites in successive 50 ms time windows (Figure 4E). From 75 ms after stimulus presentation onward, edge modulation was stronger than center modulation (main effect of RF position, dark gray area; F1,58 > 9.5, p < 0.05; with Bonferroni correction) that was maintained until the monkey's response. From 225 ms onward, there was also a main effect of task and a significant interaction (both Ps < 0.05) between RF position and task (light gray region in Figure 4E), because the center modulation depended more on attention than edge modulation. This interaction persisted until the onset of the saccade (Figure 4E, right panel) and the effect of attention on FGM was largest just before the eye movement was made (Supplemental Information, Figure S2E). Next, we analyzed how well neurons at individual recording sites distinguished between figure and ground on single trials by computing d-primes (from 200 to 600 ms, see Experimental Procedures). The average d-prime of the center modulation was 0.32 if the figure was ignored and it increased by 68% to a value of 0.53 if it was attended (Figure 4F, paired t test p < 10−6). We also observed a significant albeit weaker effect of attention on the d-prime of edge-FGM that increased from 0.53 to a value of 0.61 (15% increase, Figure 4G, paired t test p < 10−6). Our results show that top-down attention increases FGM in V1. We also investigated neuronal activity in V4, which is one of the sources of feedback to V1. In these experiments we used the same figure size as in V1 because we wanted to compare the two areas in the same task. However, RFs in V4 were much larger than those in V1 and it was often impossible to confine the V4 RF to the interior of the figure. In V4 we therefore did not distinguish between activity evoked by the figure center and edge but only compared conditions with the RF on the figure and on the background. Figure 5A illustrates how the figures were positioned relative to the RF of an example V4 recording site (for RF mapping, see Supplemental Information). In both the figure-detection and curve-tracing task, the figure evoked stronger responses than the background (average across five sessions per task), but FGM was strongest if the monkey attended the figure (t test, p < 0.05, Figures 5B and 5C). The space-time representation revealed that FGM occurred for all stimuli with the RF on the figure (Figures 5D and 5E). FGM was particularly strong and early if one of the edges fell on the center of the RF, whereas the effect of attention was expressed during a later phase of the response. We obtained similar results across a population of 46 V4 recordings sites in the three monkeys (Figure 6). In both tasks, the figure evoked stronger activity than the background in V4, and this FGM was apparent at a relatively early phase of the response. Figures 6C and 6D shows the space-time profile of the FGM. FGM in the two tasks was similar in the first phase of the response, but it became stronger in the figure-detection task from 175 ms onward (Figure 6E, p < 0.05, paired t tests in successive 50 ms windows with Bonferroni correction), which is 50 ms earlier than the attention effect in V1. An analysis across individual V4 recording sites showed that attention increased the FGM d-prime by 64% from an average of 0.68 in the curve-tracing task to 1.12 in the figure-detection task (paired t test p < 10−6, Figure 6F). As in area V1, FGM as well as the effect of attention in V4 also increased just before the saccade (Figure S2F). We carried out a number of control analyses which showed that the response modulations in V1 and V4 could not be explained by differences in eye position between conditions (Supplemental Information, Figure S3). To quantify the strength of visually driven activity we used the signal-to-noise ratio of the response transient evoked by the appearance of the texture (peak response divided by SD of spontaneous activity, see Experimental Procedures). The average signal-to-noise ratio in V1 was 9.3, which was more than twice as strong as the value of 4.1 in V4 (4.1, t test p < 10−6). In contrast, FGM was stronger in V4 than in V1. In the figure-detection task, the FGM d-prime was 1.12 in V4, significantly larger than the center modulation (d-prime = 0.53) and edge modulation in V1 (d-prime = 0.61) (p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). In the curve-tracing task, the average FGM d-prime in V4 was 0.68, which was significantly larger than the d-prime for the V1 center modulation of 0.32 (p < 0.0001) but only marginally larger than the edge modulation in V1 (0.53; p = 0.06). As a measure for the attentional effect, we computed the increase in the FGM d-prime if attention was directed to the figure compared to when it was not (a few recording sites with weak FGM in the curve-tracing task were excluded: one case in V4, two cases for V1 center, and one for V1 edge modulation). Attention increased FGM in V4 by 100%, on average, which was similar to the increase of 130% of the center modulation in V1 (t test, p > 0.4). Attention increased edge modulation by only 19%, which was weaker than the effect on V1 center modulation (paired t test, p < 0.001) and V4 FGM (t test p < 0.05). Thus, attention had a strong influence on FGM in V4 and also on the V1 representation of the figure center, but a comparatively weak effect on the V1 edge representation. The monkeys were proficient in the curve-tracing task with an average accuracy of 94%. We therefore considered the possibility that larger attentional effects on FGM occur with a more demanding curve-tracing task that removes more resources from the texture-defined figure. We therefore performed an additional experiment with the same texture stimuli while we varied the difficulty of the curve tracing-task (Figure S4). However, we found that the magnitude of the attentional effects did not depend strongly on task difficulty (Figure S4). The figure-detection task demanded precise saccades because the eye had to land in a 2.5° window in the center of the 4° figure. Thus, eye movement planning had to rely on the selection of the figural elements and the subsequent determination of the figure center, e.g., by computing the spatial average of all figural elements. We hypothesized that eye movement planning could benefit from FGM in V1, because this signal provides a high-resolution representation of the figural elements. If so, FGM might predict the timing and the accuracy of the saccade and the spatial profile of FGM might predict the saccadic landing point. The monkeys had to maintain fixation for 600 ms after stimulus onset and they often predicted the offset of the fixation point, because the saccade followed after a median delay of 100 ms, which is shorter than the typical reaction time in a detection task. To investigate the relationship between saccade planning and FGM we divided trials into fast responses (<100 ms after fixation point offset) and slow responses (>100 ms) and compared the FGM (Figure 7A ). We observed that the magnitude of V1 FGM in the center of the figure gradually increased toward the saccade. This ramping of V1 activity occurred earlier in fast trials than in slow trials: the FGM d-prime was strongest in the fast trials in a window of 400–600 ms after stimulus onset (p < 0.05, Figure S5E). This effect also occurred, albeit weaker, for the V1 edge modulation (p < 0.05) but was not apparent in V4 (Figure S5E). We next investigated the relation between FGM and the saccade landing position. We measured the deviation from the median saccade landing position for every stimulus position (Figure 2B) on every trial and selected the 25% of the trials where the saccadic endpoint deviated most to the left but still landed in the 2.5° target window (blue arrows in Figure 7B) and the 25% of the trials where the saccade deviated most to the right (red arrows). In the remaining 50% of trials the saccadic endpoint was relatively close to the center (green arrows). Figures 7C and 7D shows the spatiotemporal profile of V1 FGM in the trials with deviating saccades. If the saccade deviated to the left, FGM was higher on the left side of the figure and if the saccade deviated to the right FGM was strong on the right side of the figure (paired t tests, p < 0.05). In the trials where the saccade ended close to the center, FGM was more homogeneous (Figure 7E) and stronger (p < 0.05, see Supplemental Information). Accordingly, the strength of FGM in area V1 predicted saccadic accuracy (Figure S6). We observed similar effects in V4 where an increase of FGM on the left predicted that the saccade would deviate to the left, and an increase in FGM on the right predicted a deviation of the saccade to the right (Figure S6). These results suggest that the profile of FGM is read out for the accurate planning of saccades toward the center of the figure. The relative timing of the neuronal activity evoked by the line elements, the FGM and the attention effects provides insight into the chain of events underlying figure-ground segregation. To measure the timing of visually driven activity, we fitted a curve to the average visual responses and took the time point where it reached 33% of its maximum as an estimate of latency (Roelfsema et al., 2007Roelfsema P.R. Tolboom M. Khayat P.S. Different processing phases for features, figures, and selective attention in the primary visual cortex.Neuron. 2007; 56: 785-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (colored traces in Figure 8A , see Supplemental Information). The latency of the visual response in V1 was 40 ms and the latency in V4 was 52 ms, and a bootstrap analysis indicated that this latency difference was significant (p < 0.01). To measure the latency of FGM in the two areas, we fitted the same type of curve to the difference between the responses evoked by the figure and background (Figure 8A). The edge modulation in V1 had a latency of 60 ms and was followed by FGM in V4 at latency of 67 ms. These latencies were both later than the visual response in V4 (p < 0.05), and the difference between them was marginally significant (p = 0.06). Finally, the V1 center modulation occurred with a latency of 95 ms, significantly later than V1 edge-FGM and V4 FGM (both Ps < 0.05). An analysis of latency across individual recording sites confirmed these effects. Activity in area V1 started with the visual response, which was followed by edge-FGM (Figure 8B, p < 10−6, paired t test), which was, in turn, followed by center-FGM (Figure 8C, p < 10−4, paired t test). Also in area V4 there was a significant delay between the visual response and the FGM (Figure 8D, p < 10−4, paired t test). We determined the timing of the attention effect by subtracting the F"

Cancer stem/progenitor cells (or tumor-initiating cells, TICs) are hypothesized to be chemoresistant, and the existence of TICs in ovarian cancer has been previously demonstrated. However, the key signals and molecular events regulating the formation and expansion of ovarian tumor-initiating cells (OTICs) remain elusive. Here, we show that c-Kit is not just a marker of OTICs, but also a critical mediator of the phenotype that can be a viable target for the treatment of ovarian cancer. In contrast to non-OICs, c-Kit was overexpressed in OTICs. Moreover, the use of small interfering RNA to inhibit c-Kit expression markedly attenuated the number and size of OTIC subpopulations, inhibited the expression of stem cell markers and decreased the tumorigenic capabilities of OTICs. Imatinib (Gleevec), a clinical drug that blocks c-Kit kinase activity, also demonstrated its inhibition potency on OTICs. In addition, cisplatin/paclitaxel, which killed non-OTICs, with c-Kit knockdown or imatinib revealed that this was critically required for intervening ovarian cancer progression and recurrence in vitro and in xenograft tumors in vivo. Similar results were obtained with OTICs derived from ovarian carcinoma patients. Studies into the mechanisms suggest an important role for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin and ATP-binding cassette G2 downstream of c-Kit. The tumor-promoting microenvironment, such as hypoxia, could promote OTICs via upregulation of c-Kit expression. These results unravel an integral role for c-Kit in ovarian neoplastic processes and shed light on its mechanisms of action."

LRP4 is a receptor of agrin that is thought to act in cis to stimulate MuSK in muscle fibers for postsynaptic differentiation. Here we dissected the roles of LRP4 in muscle fibers and motoneurons in NMJ formation by cell-specific mutation. Studies of muscle-specific mutants suggest that LRP4 is involved in deciding where to form AChR clusters in muscle fibers, postsynaptic differentiation, and axon terminal development. LRP4 in HEK293 cells increased synapsin or SV2 puncta in contacting axons of cocultured neurons, suggesting a synaptogenic function.

The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a cholinergic synapse between motoneurons and skeletal muscle fibers that has most, if not all, features characteristic of a chemical synapse in the brain. Because of its simplicity, high spatial resolution, and accessibility, the NMJ has served as an informative model of synaptogenesis (Sanes and Lichtman, 1999Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W.

Its development requires the precise coordination between presynaptic motoneurons and postsynaptic muscle fibers. Mechanisms by which motoneurons instruct postsynaptic differentiation are better characterized, whereas relatively little is known about retrograde signals from the muscle fibers.

It also interacts with MuSK and this interaction is increased in response to agrin. Recent studies of the crystal structure of an agrin-LRP4 complex suggest that monomeric agrin interacts with LRP4 to form a binary complex, which promotes the synergistic formation of a tetramer crucial for agrin-induced AChR clustering (Zong et al., 2012Zong Y.

To further investigate how LRP4 regulates NMJ formation, we generated and characterized mutant mice that lack LRP4 specifically in muscle cells or motoneurons or both cells. Remarkably, HSA-LRP4−/− mice, in which LRP4 is specifically ablated in muscle cells, survived at birth and formed primitive NMJs, unlike LRP4 null mutant mice, suggesting that a role of LRP4 in motoneurons or other cells in NMJ formation in the absence of muscle LRP4. Severe morphological and functional deficits were observed in motor nerve terminals in HSA-LRP4−/− mice, indicating a critical role of muscle LRP4 for presynaptic differentiation. These hypotheses were further tested in mutant mice that lacked LRP4 in motoneurons or in both muscle fibers and motoneurons. Results revealed distinct functions of LRP4 in muscle fibers and in motoneurons in NMJ formation and maintenance and suggest that LRP4 of motoneurons was able to serve as agrin's receptor in trans to stimulate MuSK-dependent AChR clustering. Genetic rescues demonstrated that LRP4 in muscle cells is sufficient to initiate signaling for NMJ formation (data not shown) (Gomez and Burden, 2011Gomez A.M. Burden S.J.

Both mRNA and protein levels of LRP4 in resulting HSA-Cre;LRP4f/f (or HSA-LRP4−/−) mice were significantly reduced, compared to control LRP4f/f mice. The reduction was specific for muscles and was not observed in other tissues including spinal cords (Figures S1C and S1D). Residual LRP4 detected in the “muscle” preparation may be due to contamination by nerve terminals, blood vessels, and Schwann cells in muscles, as observed previously (Li et al., 2008Li X.M.

A majority of HSA-LRP4−/− pups did not die until P15 (Figure S1E).

The neonatal survival of HSA-LRP4−/− mice suggests that NMJs may form in the absence of LRP4 in muscle fibers. To test this hypothesis, we stained HSA-LRP4−/− diaphragms whole mount for AChR and phrenic nerve terminals. Indeed, AChR clusters were observed in HSA-LRP4−/− diaphragms (Figures 1A–1C ). However, compared to those in control LRP4f/f diaphragms, the clusters in HSA-LRP4−/− mice were abnormal with the following characteristics. First, they were distributed in a wider area in the middle of muscle fibers. The endplate bandwidth increased from 166 ± 28 μm in control to 806 ± 103 μm (p < 0.01, n = 5) in P0 as well as P10 HSA-LRP4−/− mice (Figures 1A–1D), suggesting a role of muscle LRP4 in restricting AChR clusters in the central region. Second, the clusters appeared elongated in morphology. In control mice, 93.9% of the clusters were between 10–30 μm in length; however, in HSA-LRP4−/− mice, cluster length ranged from 5 to >40 μm (Figures 1A–1C and 1E). The average size of AChR clusters was reduced (Figure 1F). Moreover, the clusters distributed along nerve terminals were consistently smaller (Figure 1C), suggesting that motor terminals were unable to induce normal clusters. Third, we quantified AChR clusters in 1 mm segments of left ventral diaphragms to include clusters distributed outside the central area. The number was increased from 588 ± 96 in control to 708 ± 89 in HSA-LRP4−/− diaphragms (p = 0.03, n = 4) (Figures 1A–1C and 1G). The average number of AChR clusters per muscle fiber increased from 1.30 ± 0.45 in control to 1.59 ± 0.72 in HSA-LRP4−/− mutants (p < 0.05, n = 37) (Figures S2A and S2B). These results suggest formation of abnormal ectopic AChR clusters in HSA-LRP4−/− mice. Finally, the AChR density at HSA-LRP4−/− NMJs was reduced because the amplitudes of miniature endplate potentials (mEPPs) were smaller than those in control mice (Figures 2A–2C ). These results indicate that AChR clusters formed in mutant mice were immature with altered number, size, and AChR density. Together, these results indicate that the formation of the immature clusters is not dependent on LRP4 in muscles but LRP4 from a nonmuscle source, likely motoneurons. LRP4 in muscle cells, however, appeared to be necessary for AChR cluster restriction in the central region and AChR cluster maturation (see below).Figure 2Compromised NMJ Transmission in HSA-LRP4−/− MiceShow full captionmEPPs were recorded in P0 (A–E) and P15 (F–J) control and HSA-LRP4−/− muscles.(A and F) Representative mEPP traces.(B and G) Cumulative probability plot of mEPP amplitude distribution.(C and H) Reduced mEPP amplitudes in P0 HSA-LRP4−/− mice.(D and I) Cumulative probability plot of mEPP frequency distribution.(E and J) Reduced mEPP frequencies in HSA-LRP4−/− mice. ∗p < 0.05; ∗∗p < 0.01 (mean ± SEM, n = 5 for P0; n = 4 for P15; t test).

Black, control mice; red, HSA-LRP4−/− mice. Motor nerve terminal differentiation is impaired in LRP4mitt null mice. The terminals failed to stop in the central region of muscle fibers and instead arborized extensively as if to search for AChR clusters that do not form at all in LRP4mitt null mutant mice (Weatherbee et al., 2006Weatherbee S.D. Anderson K.V. Niswander L.A. LDL-receptor-related protein 4 is crucial for formation of the neuromuscular junction.Development. 2006; 133: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). These results suggest that LRP4 is critical for motor nerve terminal differentiation. Muscle rescue experiments suggested a role of muscle LRP4 in this event (data not shown) (Gomez and Burden, 2011Gomez A.M. Burden S.J. The extracellular region of Lrp4 is sufficient to mediate neuromuscular synapse formation.Dev. Dyn. 2011; 240: 2626-2633Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, loss-of-function evidence is lacking, which is critical because LRP4 in motoneurons may also regulate NMJ formation (see below). Gain-of-function studies were unable to dissect exact roles of muscle LRP4 in motor terminal navigation and differentiation. In particular, the relationship between AChR clusters and arborized terminals in the absence of LRP4 could not be investigated because LRP4mitt null mice do not form AChR clusters. In HSA-LRP4−/− mutant mice, primary nerve branches were located in the central region of muscle fibers, as in control mice (Figures 1A and 1H), indicating proper nerve navigation in the absence of muscle LRP4. However, the secondary or intramuscular branches were increased remarkably in number from 55 ± 5.5 in control to 74 ± 8.8 in HSA-LRP4−/− mutant mice (Figures 1A and 1I) and in length from 49.7 ± 15.3 μm in control to 170 ± 89.4 μm in HSA-LRP4−/− mutant mice (p < 0.01, n = 5) (Figures 1C and 1J and Table S1). In addition, they formed tertiary and quaternary branches that effectively increased the number of nerve terminals in HSA-LRP4−/− diaphragms (Figures 1A and 1C). These phenotypes qualitatively resembled those in LRP4mitt null mice, indicating a critical role of LRP4 in muscles, not motor neurons, in presynaptic differentiation. Intriguingly, motor axons in HSA-LRP4−/− mice did not end with AChR clusters, unlike those in controls where terminals associated with clusters. Rather, the axons ignored or bypassed the clusters to “overshoot” toward the periphery of muscle fibers where AChR clusters were absent (Figure 1C, arrows). These observations indicate that muscle, but not neuronal, LRP4 is necessary for a stop signal to motor axons and suggest that such a stop signal is not mediated by homophilic interaction between LRP4 in muscles and motoneurons. In LRP4f/+ control littermates, BTX staining showed almost complete registration to synaptophysin (Figure S2C, arrows). In contrast, however, the area stained by both BTX and synaptophysin was reduced from 51.9% ± 10.0% in control to 22.9% ± 15.2% at HSA-LRP4−/− NMJs (Figure S2D), although every AChR cluster was positive for synaptophysin. In agreement, mEPP frequency was reduced by 53.3% at HSA-LRP4−/− NMJs (0.42 ± 0.09/min in HSA-LRP4−/− versus 0.90 ± 0.11/min in control littermates) (Figures 2A, 2D, and 2E), indicating compromised vesicle release in the absence of muscle LRP4. Amplitudes of endplate potentials (EPPs) were decreased from 22.2mV ± 2.17mV in control to 6.75mV ± 2.22mV in HSA-LRP4−/− mice (p < 0.01, control n = 5, and HSA-LRP4−/− n = 4), suggesting a reduction in quantum contents. During development in wild-type mice, mEPP amplitudes decreased from 2.30mV ± 0.23mV at P0 to 1.63mV ± 0.10mV at P15 NMJs (Figures 2C and 2H), whereas the frequencies increased during this time (from 0.90 ± 0.11/min at P0 to 27.0 ± 3.1/min at P15) (Figures 2E and 2J), in agreement with previous reports (Kelly, 1978Kelly S.S. The effect of age on neuromuscular transmission.J. Physiol. 1978; 274: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In HSA-LRP4−/− mice, however, mEPP frequencies were unable to increase during this time and were only 2.8% of control littermate at P15 when most mutant mice died (Figures 2E and 2J). Notice that mEPP amplitudes in HSA-LRP4−/− mice between P0 and P15 were similar (Figures 2C and 2H). These results indicate that in the absence of muscle LRP4, the development or maturation of presynaptic terminals is more severely impaired than postsynaptic counterparts. Next, we examined NMJ structures in control and HSA-LRP4−/− mice by electron microscopic analysis. In control or LRP4loxp/+ NMJs, axon terminals were filled with synaptic vesicles, some of which were docked on electron-dense active zones (Figure 3A ). Quantitatively, nerve terminal numbers at P0 decreased from 3.16 ± 0.75 in control to 1.5 ± 0.54 in HSA-LRP4−/− mice and at P15 from 4.0 ± 0.89 in control to 1.40 ± 0.55 in HSA-LRP4−/− mice, respectively (p < 0.01, n = 6) (Figure 3B). The number of active zones was decreased from 2.17 ± 0.75 and 3.0 ± 0.89 in control to 1.0 ± 0.63 and 0.33 ± 0.52 in mutant mice at P0 and P15, respectively (p < 0.05 in P0 and p < 0.01 in P15, n = 6) (Figure 3C). The density of synaptic vesicles within 0.04 μm2 areas surrounding active zones or adjacent to terminals was decreased in both P0 and P15 HSA-LRP4−/− mice (5.67 ± 1.0 in control to 1.67 ± 1.73 in mutants and 9.78 ± 1.20 in control to 3.67 ± 2.12 in mutants, respectively) (p < 0.01, n = 9) (Figure 3D), although the sizes or diameters of synaptic vesicles were similar between control and HSA-LRP4−/− mice (Figure 3E). Muscle LRP4 mutation seems to have little effect on the synaptic cleft width (Figure 3F); however, postjunctional folds, which were occasional at P0 and prominent at P15, were decreased (Figure 3A), as indicated by reduction in postsynaptic membrane length from 9.93 ± 2.57 μm in control to 6.19 ± 1.26 μm in HSA-LRP4−/− mice at P0 (p < 0.05, n = 6) and from 30.2 ± 8.51 μm in control to 15.9 ± 6.90 μm in HSA-LRP4−/− mice at P15 (p < 0.01, n = 8) (Figure 3G). These results provide anatomical evidence for NMJ deficits in HSA-LRP4−/− mice, in agreement with impaired neurotransmission revealed by electrophysiological recording. The finding that NMJs formed in HSA-LRP4−/− mice, but not in LRP4mitt null mice, suggests a role of LRP4 in motoneurons in NMJ formation. Indeed, LRP4 is a ubiquitous protein, present in various tissues including the spinal cord and brain, in addition to skeletal muscles (Lu et al., 2007Lu Y. Tian Q.B. Endo S. Suzuki T. A role for LRP4 in neuronal cell viability is related to apoE-binding.Brain Res. 2007; 1177: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, Weatherbee et al., 2006Weatherbee S.D. Anderson K.V.

LDL-receptor-related protein 4 is crucial for formation of the neuromuscular junction.Development. 2006; 133: 4993-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar) (Figure S1D) (see below). Is LRP4 in motoneurons required for NMJ formation? To address this question, we generated motoneuron-specific LRP4 mutant mice, HB9-LRP4−/−, by crossing HB9-Cre mice with floxed LRP4 mice. HB9 is a motoneuron-specific transcription factor critical for motoneuron differentiation (Arber et al., 1999Arber S. Han B. Mendelsohn M. Smith M. Jessell T.M. Sockanathan S.

https://openalex.org/W2000557409,"Microalgae have been widely reported as a promising source of biofuels, mainly based on their high areal productivity of biomass and lipids as triacylglycerides and the possibility for cultivation on non-arable land. The isolation and selection of suitable strains that are robust and display high growth and lipid accumulation rates is an important prerequisite for their successful cultivation as a bioenergy source, a process that can be compared to the initial selection and domestication of agricultural crops. We developed standard protocols for the isolation and cultivation for a range of marine and brackish microalgae. By comparing growth rates and lipid productivity, we assessed the potential of subtropical coastal and brackish microalgae for the production of biodiesel and other oil-based bioproducts. This study identified Nannochloropsis sp., Dunaniella salina and new isolates of Chlorella sp. and Tetraselmis sp. as suitable candidates for a multiple-product algae crop. We conclude that subtropical coastal microalgae display a variety of fatty acid profiles that offer a wide scope for several oil-based bioproducts, including biodiesel and omega-3 fatty acids. A biorefinery approach for microalgae would make economical production more feasible but challenges remain for efficient harvesting and extraction processes for some species."
https://openalex.org/W1972434476,"A fundamental event in the development and progression of malignant melanoma is the deregulation of cancer-relevant transcription factors. We recently showed that c-Jun is a main regulator of tumor progression in melanoma and thus the most important member of the AP-1 transcription factor family for this disease. Interestingly, we revealed that c-Jun expression was regulated on the post-transcriptional level and therefore speculated that miRNAs could be involved in c-Jun regulation. We determined seed sequences for miR-125b and miR-527 in the coding region of c-Jun mRNA that hints at the direct involvement of miRNA-dependent regulation on the protein level. We found that the expression of miR-125b was significantly reduced in malignant melanoma cell lines and tissue samples compared with melanocytes, whereas miR-527 remained unchanged. In further functional experiments, treatment of melanoma cells with pre-miR-125b resulted in strong suppression of cellular proliferation and migration, supporting the role of miR-125b in melanoma. In addition, transfection of pre-miR-125b led to strong downregulation of c-Jun protein but not mRNA expression in melanoma cells. Luciferase assays using reporter plasmids containing the miR-125b seed sequence in the luciferase coding region confirmed the direct interaction with miR-125b. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of Ago-2 revealed that c-Jun mRNA accumulated in the RNA-induced silencing complex after pre-miR-125b transfection in melanoma cells. In summary, we identified an important role for miR-125b in malignant melanoma. Moreover, we demonstrated post-transcriptional regulation of c-Jun by this miRNA and showed that c-Jun is a main mediator of the effects of miR-125b on melanoma cells."
https://openalex.org/W2036388991,"Epigenetic deregulation of gene expression has a role in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). The histone methyltransferase MMSET/WHSC1 (Multiple Myeloma SET domain) is overexpressed in a number of metastatic tumors, but its mechanism of action has not been defined. In this work, we found that PCa cell lines expressed significantly higher levels of MMSET compared with immortalized, non-transformed prostate cells. Knockdown experiments showed that, in metastatic PCa cell lines, dimethylation of lysine 36 and trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K36me2 and H3K27me3, respectively) depended on MMSET expression, whereas depletion of MMSET in benign prostatic cells did not affect chromatin modifications. Knockdown of MMSET in DU145 and PC-3 tumor cells decreased cell proliferation, colony formation in soft agar and strikingly diminished cell migration and invasion. Conversely, overexpression of MMSET in immortalized, non-transformed RWPE-1 cells promoted cell migration and invasion, accompanied by an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Among a panel of EMT-promoting genes analyzed, TWIST1 expression was strongly activated in response to MMSET. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that MMSET binds to the TWIST1 locus and leads to an increase in H3K36me2, suggesting a direct role of MMSET in the regulation of this gene. Depletion of TWIST1 in MMSET-overexpressing RWPE-1 cells blocked cell invasion and EMT, indicating that TWIST1 was a critical target of MMSET, responsible for the acquisition of an invasive phenotype. Collectively, these data suggest that MMSET has a role in PCa pathogenesis and progression through epigenetic regulation of metastasis-related genes."
https://openalex.org/W2094757948,"The concept of β-diversity, defined as dissimilarity among communities, has been widely used to investigate biodiversity patterns and community assembly rules. However, in ecosystems with high taxonomic β-diversity, due to marked environmental gradients, the level of functional β-diversity among communities is largely overlooked while it may reveal processes shaping community structure. Here, decomposing biodiversity indices into α (local) and γ (regional) components, we estimated taxonomic and functional β-diversity among tropical estuarine fish communities, through space and time. We found extremely low functional β-diversity values among fish communities (<1.5%) despite high dissimilarity in species composition and species dominance. Additionally, in contrast to the high α and γ taxonomic diversities, α and γ functional diversities were very close to the minimal value. These patterns were caused by two dominant functional groups which maintained a similar functional structure over space and time, despite the strong dissimilarity in taxonomic structure along environmental gradients. Our findings suggest that taxonomic and functional β-diversity deserve to be quantified simultaneously since these two facets can show contrasting patterns and the differences can in turn shed light on community assembly rules."
https://openalex.org/W2107514327,"Memory and perception have long been considered separate cognitive processes, and amnesia resulting from medial temporal lobe (MTL) damage is thought to reflect damage to a dedicated memory system. Recent work has questioned these views, suggesting that amnesia can result from impoverished perceptual representations in the MTL, causing an increased susceptibility to interference. Using a perceptual matching task for which fMRI implicated a specific MTL structure, the perirhinal cortex, we show that amnesics with MTL damage including the perirhinal cortex, but not those with damage limited to the hippocampus, were vulnerable to object-based perceptual interference. Importantly, when we controlled such interference, their performance recovered to normal levels.

It is well-established that as information flows from posterior to anterior regions of the VVS, representations of visual stimulus features are organized hierarchically in increasingly complex conjunctions (Figure 1; Desimone and Ungerleider, 1989Desimone R.

When an object is viewed, multiple representations of this object are activated throughout the entire VVS, with different representations occurring at different stages of the pathway. The object's low-level features are represented in early posterior regions, whereas conjunctions of features are represented in more anterior regions, with the most complex feature conjunctions—perhaps at the level of the whole object—being represented in regions such as the PRC. The traditional memory systems view argues that MTL structures such as PRC support exclusively mnemonic functions (Clark et al., 2011Clark R.E. Reinagel P. Broadbent N.J. Flister E.D. Squire L.R.

In contrast, the representational-hierarchical view proposes that stimulus representations throughout the VVS and MTL are useful for any cognitive function that requires them (Bussey and Saksida, 2002Bussey T.J.

This account seeks to explore whether damage to the high-level representations maintained in MTL regions can account for a variety of deficits observed in amnesia. Under this model, one need not postulate separate memory and perceptual systems. One important prediction of this view—yet to be tested in humans—is that if the complex, object-level representations within the PRC are damaged, interference from incidental, irrelevant features can become catastrophic (Cowell et al., 2006Cowell R.A. Bussey T.J. Saksida L.M. Why does brain damage impair memory? A connectionist model of object recognition memory in perirhinal cortex.J.

Paradoxical false memory for objects after brain damage.Science. 2010; 330: 1408-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A stream of visual input (such as that encountered over a delay) can create interference at the level of individual features, simply because different objects tend to share lower-level features (e.g., shapes, colors, etc.). However, the conjunctive representations usually maintained in PRC are unique to each individual object and resolve this interference. A similar argument would apply to other regions in the MTL such as the hippocampus, albeit in the context of more complex stimulus representations such as spatial scenes (Bussey and Saksida, 2007Bussey T.J.

Perceptual deficits in amnesia: challenging the medial temporal lobe ‘mnemonic’ view.Neuropsychologia. 2005; 43: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). To test this idea for the first time in humans, we focused on PRC as a structure located at the interface between putative mnemonic and perceptual systems in the brain. Thus, we concentrated on the type of visual objects thought to be represented in PRC (e.g., Barense et al., 2005Barense M.D. Bussey T.J. Lee A.C. Rogers T.T. Davies R.R. Saksida L.M. Murray E.A.

Neurosci. 2002; 15: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and developed a visual matching task in which participants indicated whether two simultaneously presented trial-unique objects were the same or different (Figures 2A–2D ). Across the different conditions, we manipulated the degree to which conjunctions of object features would be processed. In the High Feature Ambiguity condition, many features overlapped across objects and thus the overall object conjunction (as opposed to single features) provided a more efficient analysis strategy. In the Low Feature Ambiguity condition, a single feature readily provided the solution. Two size conditions provided a control for task difficulty. Experiment 1 investigated eye movements in healthy participants to determine participants' underlying strategy for solving the discriminations (i.e., using single features versus conjunctions). In experiment 2, we used fMRI of healthy participants to test the following two predictions: (1) activity within the PRC would be modulated by the degree of feature ambiguity, when controlling for difficulty, and (2) this modulation by feature ambiguity would be greater in the PRC than in a neighboring MTL area, the hippocampus. While the hippocampus is also implicated in amnesia, its function according to the representational-hierarchical theory is to bind objects to spatiotemporal contexts, not to bind features into objects (Cowell et al., 2006Cowell R.A.

Perceptual deficits in amnesia: challenging the medial temporal lobe ‘mnemonic’ view.Neuropsychologia. 2005; 43: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), and thus we would not expect hippocampal activity to be modulated by degree of feature ambiguity using objects. In experiment 3, we administered the same task to six amnesic cases with focal brain damage and similar degrees of memory impairment. Based on structural and volumetric analyses of critical regions within the MTL, these cases were categorized as follows: (1) individuals with bilateral medial temporal lobe damage that included PRC (MTL cases with PRC damage: n = 2) and (2) individuals with damage predominantly limited to the hippocampus (HC cases: n = 4). We predicted (1) worse performance in the MTL cases with PRC damage relative to healthy controls, specifically for the High Ambiguity condition, and (2) a greater such impairment in the MTL cases with PRC damage than HC cases, for the reasons mentioned above. In experiment 4, we investigated whether amnesia following damage that included PRC could be characterized by a heightened susceptibility to perceptual interference. There were three conditions involving High Ambiguity stimuli (Low Interference 1, High Interference, Low Interference 2). The High Interference condition contained consecutive High Ambiguity Object trials, whereas every High Ambiguity Object trial in both Low Interference conditions was interspersed with two trials containing photographs of easily discriminable everyday objects (Figures 2E–2G). We predicted that the nature of the intervening stimuli would affect performance in individuals with PRC damage, with better performance under conditions of low interference. Analysis of eye movement patterns in healthy participants indicated that the High Ambiguity condition was associated with a greater degree of conjunctive processing than the other conditions. We performed a planned interaction comparison to determine if the High Ambiguity Object condition was associated with more conjunctive processing, relative to our size difficulty control: (High Ambiguity Objects – Low Ambiguity Objects) – (Difficult Size – Easy Size). This revealed that participants made more eye movement transitions within an individual object compared to transitions between the two objects in the High Ambiguity condition relative to the other conditions (t(15) = 4.08; p < 0.001) (Figure 3). Indeed, this ratio of within-item relative to between-item saccades was greater for High compared to Low Ambiguity discriminations (t(15) = 6.58, p < 0.001). We also performed an analysis of the temporal characteristics of these eye movements, which revealed a greater degree of temporal clustering in the High Ambiguity condition (see Supplemental Information, Figure S1C, available online). These results indicate that healthy participants analyzed the ambiguous objects as wholes, rather than by a serial comparison of single features. Experiments 2–4 investigated the neural substrates of this ability. In order to isolate brain regions associated with feature ambiguity resolution, while controlling for general task difficulty, our planned comparison was the same interaction t contrast described above. Estimates of the mean BOLD signal for each of the four conditions were averaged across voxels within our two anatomically defined, bilateral regions of interest: the hippocampus and PRC. The planned comparison revealed feature ambiguity effects within the PRC (t(19) = 3.5, p < 0.001; Figure 4). This region showed reliably greater activity for High relative to Low Ambiguity discriminations (t(19) = 5.2, p < 0.001), but no difference in activity for Difficult relative to Easy Size discriminations (t(19) = 0.5, p = 0.3). By contrast, the comparison of High versus Low Ambiguity Objects was not significant in the hippocampus (t(19) = 1.4, p = 0.1) (and neither was the contrast of Difficult versus Easy Size, t(19) = 1.0, p = 0.2). When activity in the two brain regions was directly compared against one another, we found a significantly greater effect of feature ambiguity in the PRC relative to the hippocampus (t(19) = 4.3, p < 0.001). This finding reflects the first fMRI demonstration of PRC activation during a task in which the critical factor of feature ambiguity (i.e., the presence or absence of repeating features) was precisely controlled. We used Crawford's modified t test to compare each patient to their respective control group (Crawford et al., 2009Crawford J.R. Garthwaite P.H. Howell D.C. On comparing a single case with a control sample: an alternative perspective.Neuropsychologia. 2009; 47: 2690-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Strikingly, we noticed a dramatic drop in performance of both of the MTL cases with PRC damage as the High Ambiguity condition progressed (Figure 5). For the first half (36 trials) of the High Ambiguity Condition, they performed within the normal range (MTL2: t(7) = 1.4, p = 0.1; MTL3: t(7) = −0.1, p = 0.4). By contrast, and inconsistent with traditional accounts of amnesia, for the second half of the condition, their performance fell well below normal performance (MTL2: t(7) = 5.4, p < 0.001; MTL3: t(7) = 4.2, p < 0.01). Critically, this drop in performance was not observed in the individuals with hippocampal lesions (t(7) < 1.0, p > 0.2), nor was it observed on any other condition in either group (t(7) < 1.3, p > 0.1). These findings suggest that the perceptual impairments of the MTL cases with PRC damage arose from the administration of multiple consecutive object discrimination trials, which results in a buildup of interference between shared features. This increased interference can no longer be overcome when conjunctive representations are unavailable, due to PRC damage. If this interference hypothesis is correct, we predicted that performance of the MTL cases with PRC damage should improve if we reduced the overlap in features across successive trials. This prediction was confirmed in experiment 4: the two MTL cases with PRC damage were again impaired on the High Interference condition that resembled the High Ambiguity condition of experiment 3 (MTL 2: t(7) = 3.3, p < 0.01; MTL 3: t(7) = 2.4, p < 0.05) (Figure 6), but when we experimentally reduced interference by interspersing dissimilar object trials, we recovered their performance to normal levels (all t(7) < 1.1, p > 0.2). Importantly, in both Low and High Interference conditions, we compared performance on every third trial only (30 High Ambiguity Object comparison trials for each condition). Thus, the important difference across the conditions was the nature of the accumulated perceptual interference across successive trials, not the total number of trials. The intact performance of the MTL cases with PRC damage on the 30 critical High Ambiguity trials in the Low Interference condition is consistent with their performance in experiment 3 (where their deficit emerged after 36 consecutive trials). Only in the High Interference condition, in which the 30 critical High Ambiguity trials were surrounded by twice as many, other interfering (High Ambiguity) trials, did their deficit arise. Furthermore, their intact performance on the Low Interference conditions, particularly the second Low Interference condition, demonstrates that their deficits were specific to the buildup of interfering features, rather than fatigue or generic task-practice effects. The hippocampal cases were not impaired on any condition (all t(7) < 0.4, p > 0.3). To address the potential concern that differences in task difficulty across conditions could have confounded our results, we analyzed the accuracy and reaction time data of control participants (shown in Figures 5 and 6; Tables S1 and S7; all reported t tests are two-tailed). Importantly, the planned interaction contrast revealed no greater difference in d′ between High Ambiguity and Low Ambiguity Objects than between Difficult and Easy Size (the interaction was not significant in experiment 2, t(19) = 1.1, p = 0.3, and was driven by a bigger drop in performance for Difficult than Easy size conditions in experiments 1 and 3, both t > 2.0, p < 0.06). In experiment 4, the condition on which the MTL patients were impaired (High Interference) was not the condition that controls found to be the most difficult: the High Interference condition was matched in difficulty to Low Interference 2 (t(21) = 0.3, p = 0.8) and significantly easier than the Low Interference 1 (t(21) = 3.1, p < 0.01). These results suggest that our observed eye movement patterns (expt 1), fMRI effects of feature ambiguity (expt 2), and patient deficits (expts 3–4) were not due to global differences in task difficulty. In terms of reaction times, the increase in RTs for High Ambiguity versus Low Ambiguity Objects was significantly greater than the increase for Difficult versus Easy Size in experiments 1–3 (a trend in expt 1: t(15) = 1.9, p = 0.07; expts 2 and 3: both t > 2.2, p < 0.05). In experiment 4, reaction times for the High Interference condition were significantly longer relative to the second Low Interference condition (t(21) = 3.0, p < 0.01), but were not significantly different from the first Low Interference condition (t(21) = 1.5, p = 0.2). These results suggest that at least for experiment 4, differences in reaction times cannot explain the patients' deficits. Nonetheless, the finding that in experiments 1–3 the High Ambiguity Object conditions were associated with longer reaction times relative to the Size Control conditions merits further consideration in light of the idea that working memory demands may have differed across conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2082834726,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive neoplastic disease. Gemcitabine, the currently used chemotherapeutic drug for PDAC, elicits only minor benefits, because of the development of escape pathways leading to chemoresistance. Herein, we aimed at investigating the involvement of the mitogen activating protein kinase interacting kinase (MNK)/eIF4E pathway in the acquired drug resistance of PDAC cells. Screening of a cohort of PDAC patients by immunohistochemistry showed that eIF4E phosphorylation correlated with disease grade, early onset of disease and worse prognosis. In PDAC cell lines, chemotherapeutic drugs induced MNK-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4E. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of MNK activity synergistically enhanced the cytostatic effect of gemcitabine, by promoting apoptosis. RNA interference (RNAi) experiments indicated that MNK2 is mainly responsible for eIF4E phosphorylation and gemcitabine resistance in PDAC cells. Furthermore, we found that gemcitabine induced the expression of the oncogenic splicing factor SRSF1 and splicing of MNK2b, a splice variant that overrides upstream regulatory pathways and confers increased resistance to the drug. Silencing of SRSF1 by RNAi abolished this splicing event and recapitulated the effects of MNK pharmacological or genetic inhibition on eIF4E phosphorylation and apoptosis in gemcitabine-treated cells. Our results highlight a novel pro-survival pathway triggered by gemcitabine in PDAC cells, which leads to MNK2-dependent phosphorylation of eIF4E, suggesting that the MNK/eIF4E pathway represents an escape route utilized by PDAC cells to withstand chemotherapeutic treatments."

A recent study reported that the progeny of single cortical progenitor cells are preferentially connected in the postnatal cortex. If these neurons acquire similar selectivity through their connections, a salt-and-pepper organization may be generated, because neurons derived from different progenitors are intermingled in rodents. Here we investigated whether clonally related cells have similar preferred orientation by using a transgenic mouse, which labels all the progeny of single cortical progenitor cells. We found that preferred orientations of clonally related cells are similar to each other, suggesting that cell lineage is involved in the development of response selectivity of neurons in the cortex. However, not all clonally related cells share response selectivity, suggesting that cell lineage is not the only determinant of response selectivity."

To achieve high instantaneous firing rates while maintaining low average firing rates, the cortex can optimize the fraction of neurons responding when the stimulus is presented (sparse population coding) and/or can optimize how frequently a single neuron responds when the stimulus is presented n times (lifetime sparseness, or fidelity as used hereafter) (Willmore et al., 2011Willmore B.D. Mazer J.A. Gallant J.L. Sparse coding in striate and extrastriate visual cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 105: 2907-2919Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Sparse coding optimizes the information per spike while minimizing mean firing rate and redundancy and, thus, minimizes metabolic load as a function of information (Vinje and Gallant, 2000Vinje W.E. Gallant J.L. Sparse coding and decorrelation in primary visual cortex during natural vision.Science. 2000; 287: 1273-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). Network models show that sparse internal representation facilitates the storage of learned associations, and cortical response sparsification may emerge as associations are learned (Chalupa and Werner, 2003Chalupa L.M. Werner J.S. The Visual Neurosciences. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA2003Google Scholar). To examine the relationship between cortical sparsification and associative learning we carried out three sets of experiments. First, we developed a variant of fear conditioning in freely exploring mice in which whisker stimulation (our conditional stimulus [CS]) was either paired or explicitly unpaired with foot shock. Second, we examined how learning the association between the CS and the shock affected subsequent encoding of the CS using in vivo calcium imaging. We measured population sparse coding, fidelity, and response strength. Third, to examine if our results were specific to associative learning, we measured the nonassociative effects of stimulus exposure on the population response. The primary somatosensory “barrel” cortex receives tactile information from the whiskers on the facial mystacial pad. This system has been exploited in restrained animals to study cortical plasticity induced by Pavlovian fear conditioning (Das et al., 2001Das S. Weiss C. Disterhoft J.F.

A novel method for precisely timed stimulation of mouse whiskers in a freely moving preparation: application for delivery of the conditioned stimulus in trace eyeblink conditioning.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2009; 177: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For our studies, we first determined whether freely exploring mice learn Pavlovian fear conditioning where whisker stimulation is used as a CS. Passive whisker stimulation in freely behaving mice was accomplished by gluing a small metal grain to a specific whisker and placing the mouse in the bore of an electromagnet (7.7 mT) large enough to permit free exploration (Melzer et al., 1985Melzer P. Van der Loos H. Dörfl J. Welker E. Robert P. Emery D. Berrini J.C. A magnetic device to stimulate selected whiskers of freely moving or restrained small rodents: its application in a deoxyglucose study.Brain Res. 1985; 348: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) (Figure 1A ). In mice conditioned to associate whisker stimulation with shock, 30 s of whisker stimulation at 8 Hz immediately preceded a single 0.6 mA, 1.5 s foot shock (paired group); this pairing was repeated five times, with a mean interval of 3 min between pairings, in a single day (Figure 1B top). To control for exposure to these two sensory stimuli, a second group received the same stimuli but explicitly unpaired (unpaired control; Figure 1B middle). Hereafter, we refer to the foot shock as the unconditional stimulus, or US. CS-elicited freezing was examined the following day. To avoid any confounding influence of context-elicited freezing, we tested the mice in a novel context. Because cued-fear memories are context independent (Kim and Fanselow, 1992Kim J.J. Fanselow M.S. Modality-specific retrograde amnesia of fear.Science. 1992; 256: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1969) Google Scholar), this strategy revealed only fear behaviors elicited by the CS and not by the context. Four conditional stimuli were presented (Figure 1B, bottom, “Test”) and the amount of time spent motionless (freezing) during each CS was measured and averaged as a behavioral indication of fear (Fanselow and Bolles, 1979Fanselow M.S. Bolles R.C. Naloxone and shock-elicited freezing in the rat.J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1979; 93: 736-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Paired mice (n = 12) froze significantly more than explicitly unpaired control mice (n = 12) during testing (Figure 1C, p < 0.05), demonstrating a learned association between the CS and the US in which the CS triggers fear. An example movie showing freezing during testing is shown in Movie S1 (available online). This learned association was evident even one month later, when whisker stimulation still induced a 3-fold increase in freezing relative to baseline (n = 8) and a significant increase compared to explicitly unpaired controls (Figure 1D, n = 9, p < 0.05), revealing a long-term memory of the association (see also Gale et al., 2004Gale G.D. Anagnostaras S.G. Godsil B.P. Mitchell S. Nozawa T. Sage J.R. Wiltgen B. Fanselow M.S. Role of the basolateral amygdala in the storage of fear memories across the adult lifetime of rats.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3810-3815Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). We next examined if the fear response could be evoked by stimulation of either an adjacent or distant, untrained whisker. We found no generalization to a distant, untrained whisker (Figure 2A , compare “CS: Paired trained” with “CS: Paired remote”; paired n = 7, unpaired n = 7) but did find generalization to an adjacent whisker (Figure 2B, compare “CS: Paired trained” with “CS: Paired adjacent”; paired n = 6, unpaired n = 5). This is consistent with a former study in which rats were trained to use a single whisker to decide whether to cross a gap. The rats generalized the learning to an adjacent whisker but not to a remote whisker (Harris et al., 1999Harris J.A. Petersen R.S. Diamond M.E. Distribution of tactile learning and its neural basis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1999; 96: 7587-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). We then checked another dimension of generalization—whether the behavior could be evoked by stimulating the whisker at a frequency that is different from that used during training. We found that mice that had been trained at 8 Hz also froze when tested at 33 Hz, indicating that the fear response generalizes to other stimulus frequencies (Figure 2C, paired n = 7, unpaired n = 7). Does the learned CS-US association affect subsequent encoding of the CS in primary sensory cortex? To examine this we used 2-photon in vivo imaging to measure evoked responses of networks of cortical neurons bulk loaded with the calcium-sensitive fluorescent dye OGB-1 (Garaschuk et al., 2006Garaschuk O. Milos R.I. Konnerth A. Targeted bulk-loading of fluorescent indicators for two-photon brain imaging in vivo.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, Stosiek et al., 2003Stosiek C. Garaschuk O. Holthoff K. Konnerth A. In vivo two-photon calcium imaging of neuronal networks.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 7319-7324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Intrinsic-signal imaging (Grinvald et al., 1986Grinvald A. Lieke E. Frostig R.D. Gilbert C.D. Wiesel T.N. Functional architecture of cortex revealed by optical imaging of intrinsic signals.Nature. 1986; 324: 361-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar) was used to target dye injections to the cortical “barrel” column in primary somatosensory cortex that represented the whisker that had been stimulated during training (Figure 3A ). Measures were made of the fraction of neurons in the network that responded to whisker stimulation, the response magnitude of each imaged neuron, and the fidelity of neural responses across stimulus trials. For each imaging field, neural responses were imaged to ten whisker stimulations spaced 10 s apart. The analyses of changes in fluorescence were restricted to a 2 s window immediately following the onset of whisker stimulation. A total of 816 cells were imaged in seven fear-conditioned mice, and 833 cells in six explicitly unpaired control mice. Cortical networks are spontaneously active, and this spontaneous activity must be considered when defining evoked responses. To examine spontaneous activity we measured changes in fluorescence in a 2 s time window immediately following each of ten sham whisker stimulations delivered with the same temporal pattern as during actual trials (Figure 3B and Movie S2). We used the resulting statistics of spontaneous activity for two purposes: (1) to examine if associative fear learning affected spontaneous activity, and (2) to define thresholds of response magnitude (Figure 3C) and fidelity (Figure 3D) above which a neuron was considered responsive in subsequent trials with an actual stimulus. Here, mean response magnitude refers to the average fluorescent change across all ten sham stimuli, and fidelity refers to the number of sham trials out of ten that were temporally coincident with a given neuron's spontaneous activity (see Experimental Procedures). Importantly, there were no significant differences in spontaneous activity between paired and explicitly unpaired groups, as measured by mean response magnitude (Figure 3C: paired 1.17% ± 0.06%; unpaired 1.16% ± 0.03% dF/F, p = 0.14), mean response fidelity (Figure 3D paired 1.61; unpaired 1.66, p = 0.48) and network synchrony (Ch'ng and Reid, 2010Ch'ng Y.H. Reid R.C. Cellular imaging of visual cortex reveals the spatial and functional organization of spontaneous activity.Front. Integr. Neurosci. 2010; 4PubMed Google Scholar, Golshani et al., 2009Golshani P. Gonçalves J.T. Khoshkhoo S. Mostany R. Smirnakis S. Portera-Cailliau C. Internally mediated developmental desynchronization of neocortical network activity.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 10890-10899Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (Figure 3E, two-way ANOVA training effect F[1,320] = 1.4, p = 0.24). The values of spontaneous response magnitude (Figure 3C), and fidelity (Figure 3D) derived from sham stimuli were then used to determine the threshold for defining with 95% confidence whether a neuron was actually responding to whisker stimulation or simply happened to be spontaneously active at the moment of whisker stimulation. For magnitude of response (dF/F), the 95% cutoff in paired mice was a 3.2% increase in fluorescence above baseline, and for explicitly unpaired mice was 2.7% above baseline (see gray shading in Figure 3C). For fidelity, the 95% cutoff was 4; that is, only 5% of cells were spontaneously active during the sham stimulus more than four out of ten trials (gray shading in Figure 3D). Using these thresholds, neurons could be confidently defined as responsive based on their mean response magnitude or based on the fidelity of their response. To determine whether associative learning impacts network coding of the CS we imaged cortical responses evoked by stimulation of the trained whisker (Figure 4 and Movie S3). The fraction of responding neurons was measured in two ways because learning could change the fraction of neurons that respond to a single stimulus, or change the fraction of neurons recruited across trials, or both. This is due to the fact that trial-to-trial response variability is high in cortical networks, and thus many neurons that can encode a given stimulus often do not respond in a given trial. The pool of neurons recruited to encode a stimulus across trials is therefore significantly larger than the pool responding to a single stimulus. Relative to explicitly unpaired controls, fear-conditioned mice exhibited significant reductions in both the fraction of neurons recruited across trials to encode the CS as well as the fraction of neurons responding to a single stimulus. When we used the average magnitude of spontaneous activity to define response threshold, we found that 38% fewer neurons responded to whisker stimulation when the CS predicted a foot shock compared to controls, (Figure 5A paired 42.6% ± 4.6%; unpaired 68.4% ± 6%, p = 0.0011). Similarly, 34% fewer neurons responded to the CS relative to unpaired controls when the threshold was based on the fidelity of spontaneous activity (Figure 5B, paired 34.4% ± 4.0%; unpaired 52.07% ± 5.3%, p = 0.013). These thresholds, therefore, provide effectively the same value, and both show that, relative to controls, associative learning decreases the pool of neurons used to encode the CS across trials. Fear conditioning also decreased the fraction of neurons responding to a single trial by 38% relative to controls (Figure 5C, paired: 23% ± 3%, unpaired: 37% ± 4% p = 0.029). These measures of fractional response to a single trial are consistent with previous reports in anesthetized mice (Kerr et al., 2007Kerr J.N. de Kock C.P. Greenberg D.S. Bruno R.M. Sakmann B.

Taken together, our data show that fear conditioning enhances sparse population coding of the CS in primary somatosensory cortex. Associative learning did not alter response fidelity (Figure 5D right, paired 7.04; unpaired 7.12, p = 0.3914), but did significantly increase the strength of response to the CS. The enhanced response was seen both when response magnitude was averaged across all trials, inclusive of failures (Figure 5E left paired 6.33% ± 0.26%; unpaired 5.31% ± 0.14%, dF/F, p < 0.0001) and when failures were excluded (Figure 5E right paired 10.39% ± 0.30%; unpaired 8.95% ± 1.80% dF/F, p < 0.0001). We next plotted response magnitude as a function of response fidelity (Figure 5F) to examine whether there was an interaction effect between training and fidelity. Although there was no interaction (ANOVA F[5, 658] = 1.75, p = 0.12), there was a significant effect of fidelity on response magnitude for both paired and explicitly unpaired groups (ANOVA F[5, 658] = 58.02, p < 0.001), indicating that neurons with the highest response fidelity had stronger responses to each stimulus than neurons responding at lower fidelities. To examine the effect of associative learning on total network activity we plotted the fraction of neurons in the total population as a function of their mean magnitude of fluorescent change (Figure 5G). This plot includes all neurons, whether responsive or not, and averages their responses across all ten trials, inclusive of failures. This plot thus provides a view of total cortical activity in layer 2/3. We found a small, but significant decrease (8%) in mean cortical response to whisker stimulation after fear learning (Figure 5G paired 3.9 ± 0.1, unpaired 4.2% ± 0.1% dF/F, p < 0.001). This finding is in agreement with others (Castro-Alamancos, 2004Castro-Alamancos M.A. Absence of rapid sensory adaptation in neocortex during information processing states.Neuron. 2004; 41: 455-464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, Jasinska et al., 2010Jasinska M.

Taken together, results from the associative learning procedure show that fear learning reduces the fraction of neurons responding to the CS, while increasing the strength of responsive neurons. The net effect is an enhancement of sparse population coding with a moderate decrease in total activity.

We used this form of nonassociative learning to examine if the effects observed after associative fear conditioning were general to learning per se, or were specific to associative fear learning. We measured population responses to whisker stimulation in mice exposed 4–5 days earlier to five CS presentations during a single trial with no US (five mice total of 520 neurons). Hereafter, we refer to this group as “stimulated.” Mice not exposed to the CS were used as controls (eight mice total of 789 neurons); hereafter, we refer to this group as “naive.” Measures of spontaneous activity and network synchrony were not significantly different between naive and stimulated mice (Figure 6A , magnitude of fluorescent change: naive 1.15% ± 0.03%; stimulated 1.16% ± 0.04% dF/F, p = 0.28; Figure 6B, sham fidelity: naive 1.56; stimulated 1.49, p = 0.28; Figure 6C, network synchrony: two-way ANOVA training X distance indicated no training effect F[7, 320] = 0.81, p = 0.58). As above, these measures were used to derive the 95% threshold to define responsive neurons across trials. These values for dF/F were 3.1% for the stimulated group and 3.3% for naive controls. The 95% threshold for measures based on fidelity was four responses to ten trials for both groups. Mere exposure to a nonreinforced stimulus did not significantly alter the fraction of neurons responding to single-trial whisker stimulation (Figure 7A , naive = 33% ± 4%, stimulated = 44% ± 6%, p = 0.29). Nor were significant changes seen when we analyzed the fraction of neurons recruited across all ten trials, as described above (Figure 7B: naive = 62% ± 4%, stimulated = 68% ± 6%, p = 0.56; Figure 7C: naive = 47% ± 4%, stimulated = 57% ± 7%, p = 0.26). Notably, response fidelity, which was unaffected by associative fear learning, was strongly enhanced in stimulated mice (Figure 7D, naive 6.97, stimulated 8.28, p < 0.001). Response magnitude, however, was reduced by stimulus exposure (Figure 7E, two-way ANOVA main effect of stimulation, F[1,1502] = 59.7, p < 0.001; means in bins 1–9 naive 9.87% ± 0.16%, stimulated 8.31% ± 0.14% dF/F). As in Figure 5F, there was a significant main effect of fidelity on response strength—in both the naive and stimulated groups, the neurons that responded with the highest fidelity (ten out of ten trials) had the largest changes in fluorescence (Figure 7E, F[9,1502] = 27.95, p < 0.001). To examine the effect of passive stimulation on total network activity, we plotted the fraction of neurons in the total population as a function of their mean magnitude of fluorescent change (Figure 7F). Exposure to a nonreinforced stimulus increased total activity by 32.5% (failures included) relative to naive controls (Figure 7F, naive dF/F = 4.64% ± 0.13%, stimulated dF/F = 6.15% ± 0.24%; p < 0.0001). Taken together, our data indicate that exposure to a nonreinforced stimulus has no effect on population sparsification, but does enhance response fidelity at the expense of response strength.

https://openalex.org/W1965854108,"Small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels (SK channels) modulate excitability and curtail excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in neuronal dendrites. Here, we demonstrate long-lasting plasticity of intrinsic excitability (IE) in dendrites that results from changes in the gain of this regulatory mechanism. Using dendritic patch-clamp recordings from rat cerebellar Purkinje cells, we find that somatic depolarization or parallel fiber (PF) burst stimulation induce long-term amplification of synaptic responses to climbing fiber (CF) or PF stimulation and enhance the amplitude of passively propagated sodium spikes. Dendritic plasticity is mimicked and occluded by the SK channel blocker apamin and is absent in Purkinje cells from SK2 null mice. Triple-patch recordings from two dendritic sites and the soma and confocal calcium imaging studies show that local stimulation limits dendritic plasticity to the activated compartment of the dendrite. This plasticity mechanism allows Purkinje cells to adjust the SK2-mediated control of dendritic excitability in an activity-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2072806146,"Homologous recombination (HR) and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) are two distinct DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair pathways. Here, we report that DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), the core component of NHEJ, partnering with DNA-damage checkpoint kinases ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR), regulates HR repair of DSBs. The regulation was accomplished through modulation of the p53 and replication protein A (RPA) interaction. We show that upon DNA damage, p53 and RPA were freed from a p53-RPA complex by simultaneous phosphorylations of RPA at the N-terminus of RPA32 subunit by DNA-PK and of p53 at Ser37 and Ser46 in a Chk1/Chk2-independent manner by ATR and ATM, respectively. Neither the phosphorylation of RPA nor of p53 alone could dissociate p53 and RPA. Furthermore, disruption of the release significantly compromised HR repair of DSBs. Our results reveal a mechanism for the crosstalk between HR repair and NHEJ through the co-regulation of p53-RPA interaction by DNA-PK, ATM and ATR."
https://openalex.org/W2045105700,"A shared feature of many neural circuits is their organization into synaptic layers. However, the mechanisms that direct neurites to distinct layers remain poorly understood. We identified a central role for Netrins and their receptor Frazzled in mediating layer-specific axon targeting in the Drosophila visual system. Frazzled is expressed and cell autonomously required in R8 photoreceptors for directing their axons to the medulla-neuropil layer M3. Netrin-B is specifically localized in this layer owing to axonal release by lamina neurons L3 and capture by target neuron-associated Frazzled. Ligand expression in L3 is sufficient to rescue R8 axon-targeting defects of Netrin mutants. R8 axons target normally despite replacement of diffusible Netrin-B by membrane-tethered ligands. Finally, Netrin localization is instructive because expression in ectopic layers can retarget R8 axons. We propose that provision of localized chemoattractants by intermediate target neurons represents a highly precise strategy to direct axons to a positionally defined layer."
https://openalex.org/W1972504466,"Emotional memories can persist for a lifetime but can also undergo extinction. Although we know about the mechanisms involved in expression and extinction, we know very little about the mechanisms that determine whether a specific memory would persist or not. Here, we use partial reinforcement extinction effect (PREE) to explore the neural mechanisms that differentiate persistent from labile memories. We recorded the simultaneous activity of neurons in the amygdala and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) while monkeys engaged in tone-odor aversive conditioning. We report that under continuous reinforcement schedule (ConS), activity in the amygdala precedes behavioral response, whereas under partial schedule (ParS), dACC activity precedes it. Moreover, we find that ParS induced cross-regional pairwise correlations throughout the entire acquisition session, and their magnitude and precision predicted the later resistance to extinction. Our results suggest that memory persistence depends on distributed representations and, specifically, resistance to extinction of aversive memories is maintained by correlated amygdala-dACC activity."
https://openalex.org/W2006417904,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the pathogenesis of many forms of cancer, including the pediatric cancer neuroblastoma, but the underlying mechanisms leading to altered miRNA expression are often unknown. Here, a novel integrated approach for analyzing DNA methylation coupled with miRNA and mRNA expression data sets identified 67 epigenetically regulated miRNA in neuroblastoma. A large proportion (42%) of these miRNAs was associated with poor patient survival when underexpressed in tumors. Moreover, we demonstrate that this panel of epigenetically silenced miRNAs targets a large set of genes that are overexpressed in tumors from patients with poor survival in a highly redundant manner. The genes targeted by the epigenetically regulated miRNAs are enriched for a number of biological processes, including regulation of cell differentiation. Functional studies involving ectopic overexpression of several of the epigenetically silenced miRNAs had a negative impact on neuroblastoma cell viability, providing further support to the concept that inactivation of these miRNAs is important for neuroblastoma disease pathogenesis. One locus, miR-340, induced either differentiation or apoptosis in a cell context dependent manner, indicating a tumor suppressive function for this miRNA. Intriguingly, it was determined that miR-340 is upregulated by demethylation of an upstream genomic region that occurs during the process of neuroblastoma cell differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Further biological studies of miR-340 revealed that it directly represses the SOX2 transcription factor by targeting of its 3′-untranslated region, explaining the mechanism by which SOX2 is downregulated by ATRA. Although SOX2 contributes to the maintenance of stem cells in an undifferentiated state, we demonstrate that miR-340-mediated downregulation of SOX2 is not required for ATRA induced differentiation to occur. In summary, our results exemplify the dynamic nature of the miRNA epigenome and identify a remarkable network of miRNA/mRNA interactions that significantly contribute to neuroblastoma disease pathogenesis."

A TaqMan low-density array (TLDA) was used to characterise the expression of 380 genes associated with chemotherapy resistance in IGROVCDDP cells. Paclitaxel resistance in IGROVCDDP is mediated by gene and protein overexpression of P-glycoprotein and the protein is functionally active. Cisplatin resistance was not reversed by elacridar, confirming that cisplatin is not a P-glycoprotein substrate. Cisplatin resistance in IGROVCDDP is multifactorial and is mediated in part by the glutathione pathway and decreased accumulation of drug. Total cellular glutathione was not increased. However, the enzyme activity of GSR and GGT1 were up-regulated. The cellular localisation of copper transporter CTR1 changed from membrane associated in IGROV-1 to cytoplasmic in IGROVCDDP. This may mediate the previously reported accumulation defect. There was decreased expression of the sodium potassium pump (ATP1A), MRP1 and FBP which all have been previously associated with platinum accumulation defects in platinum-resistant cell lines. Cellular localisation of MRP1 was also altered in IGROVCDDP shifting basolaterally, compared to IGROV-1. BRCA1 was also up-regulated at the gene and protein level. The overexpression of P-glycoprotein in a resistant model developed with cisplatin is unusual. This demonstrates that P-glycoprotein can be up-regulated as a generalised stress response rather than as a specific response to a substrate. Mechanisms characterised in IGROVCDDP cells may be applicable to relapsed ovarian cancer patients treated with frontline platinum/taxane chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2051399801,"Milk composition traits exhibit a complex genetic architecture with a small number of major quantitative trait loci (QTL) explaining a large fraction of the genetic variation and numerous QTL with minor effects. In order to identify QTL for milk fat percentage (FP) in the German Holstein-Friesian (HF) population, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed. The study population consisted of 2327 progeny-tested bulls. Genotypes were available for 44,280 SNPs. Phenotypes in the form of estimated breeding values (EBVs) for FP were used as highly heritable traits. A variance components-based approach was used to account for population stratification. The GWAS identified four major QTL regions explaining 46.18% of the FP EBV variance. Besides two previously known FP QTL on BTA14 (P = 8.91×10-(198)) and BTA20 (P = 7.03×10(-12)) within DGAT1 and GHR, respectively, we uncovered two additional QTL regions on BTA5 (P = 2.00×10(-13)) and BTA27 (P = 9.83×10(-5)) encompassing EPS8 and GPAT4, respectively. EPS8 and GPAT4 are involved in lipid metabolism in mammals. Re-sequencing of EPS8 and GPAT4 revealed 50 polymorphisms. Genotypes for five of them were inferred for the entire study population. Two polymorphisms affecting potential transcription factor binding sites of EPS8 (P = 1.40×10(-12)) and GPAT4 (P = 5.18×10(-5)), respectively, were highly significantly associated with the FP EBV. Our results provide evidence that alteration of regulatory sites is an important aspect of genetic variation of complex traits in cattle."
https://openalex.org/W1985571280,"Significant adverse events (AE) have been reported in patients receiving medications for multidrug- and extensively-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB & XDR-TB). However, there is little prospective data on AE in MDR- or XDR-TB/HIV co-infected patients on antituberculosis and antiretroviral therapy (ART) in programmatic settings.Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is supporting a community-based treatment program for drug-resistant tuberculosis in HIV-infected patients in a slum setting in Mumbai, India since 2007. Patients are being treated for both diseases and the management of AE is done on an outpatient basis whenever possible. Prospective data were analysed to determine the occurrence and nature of AE.Between May 2007 and September 2011, 67 HIV/MDR-TB co-infected patients were being treated with anti-TB treatment and ART; 43.3% were female, median age was 35.5 years (Interquartile Range: 30.5-42) and the median duration of anti-TB treatment was 10 months (range 0.5-30). Overall, AE were common in this cohort: 71%, 63% and 40% of patients experienced one or more mild, moderate or severe AE, respectively. However, they were rarely life-threatening or debilitating. AE occurring most frequently included gastrointestinal symptoms (45% of patients), peripheral neuropathy (38%), hypothyroidism (32%), psychiatric symptoms (29%) and hypokalaemia (23%). Eleven patients were hospitalized for AE and one or more suspect drugs had to be permanently discontinued in 27 (40%). No AE led to indefinite suspension of an entire MDR-TB or ART regimen.AE occurred frequently in this Mumbai HIV/MDR-TB cohort but not more frequently than in non-HIV patients on similar anti-TB treatment. Most AE can be successfully managed on an outpatient basis through a community-based treatment program, even in a resource-limited setting. Concerns about severe AE in the management of co-infected patients are justified, however, they should not cause delays in the urgently needed rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy and second-line anti-TB treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1994724917,"The aim of the present study was to detect the Staphylococcus aureus delta-toxin using Whole-Cell (WC) Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS), correlate delta-toxin expression with accessory gene regulator (agr) status, and assess the prevalence of agr deficiency in clinical isolates with and without resistance to methicillin and glycopeptides. The position of the delta-toxin peak in the mass spectrum was identified using purified delta-toxin and isogenic wild type and mutant strains for agr-rnaIII, which encodes delta-toxin. Correlation between delta-toxin production and agr RNAIII expression was assessed by northern blotting. A series of 168 consecutive clinical isolates and 23 unrelated glycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus strains (GISA/heterogeneous GISA) were then tested by WC-MALDI-TOF MS. The delta-toxin peak was detected at 3005±5 Thomson, as expected for the naturally formylated delta toxin, or at 3035±5 Thomson for its G10S variant. Multivariate analysis showed that chronicity of S. aureus infection and glycopeptide resistance were significantly associated with delta-toxin deficiency (p = 0.048; CI 95%: 1.01-10.24; p = 0.023; CI 95%: 1.20-12.76, respectively). In conclusion, the S. aureus delta-toxin was identified in the WC-MALDI-TOF MS spectrum generated during routine identification procedures. Consequently, agr status can potentially predict infectious complications and rationalise application of novel virulence factor-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2087398251,"Protection from influenza A virus (IAV) challenge requires switched, high affinity Abs derived from long-lived memory B cells and plasma cells. These B cell subsets are generated in germinal centers (GCs), hallmark structures of T helper cell-driven B cell immunity. A full understanding of the GC reaction after respiratory IAV infection is lacking, as is the characterization of T follicular helper (TFH) cells that support GCs. Here, GC B cell and TFH cell responses were studied in mice following pulmonary challenge with IAV. Marked GC reactions were induced in draining lymph nodes (dLNs), lung, spleen and nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT), although the magnitude and kinetics of the response was site-specific. Examination of switching within GCs demonstrated IgG2+ cells to compose the largest fraction in dLNs, lung and spleen. IgA+ GC B cells were infrequent in these sites, but composed a significant subset of the switched GC population in NALT. Further experiments demonstrated splenectomized mice to withstand a lethal recall challenge, suggesting the spleen to be unnecessary for long-term protection in spite of strong GC responses in this organ. Final studies showed that TFH cell numbers were highest in dLNs and spleen, and peaked in all sites prior to the height of the GC reaction. TFH cells purified from dLNs generated IL-21 and IFNγ upon activation, although CD4+CXCR5− T effector cells produced higher levels of all cytokines. Collectively, these findings reveal respiratory IAV infection to induce strong T helper cell-driven B cell responses in various organs, with each site displaying unique attributes."
https://openalex.org/W2054883111,"Protein kinase Cα (PKCα) can phosphorylate the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) at threonine 654 (T654) to inhibit EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation (pY-EGFR) and the associated activation of downstream effectors. However, upregulation of PKCα in a large variety of cancers is not associated with EGFR inactivation, and factors determining the potential of PKCα to downregulate EGFR are yet unknown. Here, we show that ectopic expression of annexin A6 (AnxA6), a member of the Ca2+ and phospholipid-binding annexins, strongly reduces pY-EGFR levels while augmenting EGFR T654 phosphorylation in EGFR overexpressing A431, head and neck and breast cancer cell lines. Reduced EGFR activation in AnxA6 expressing A431 cells is associated with reduced EGFR internalization and degradation. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated PKCα knockdown in AnxA6 expressing A431 cells reduces T654-EGFR phosphorylation, but restores EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, clonogenic growth and EGFR degradation. These findings correlate with AnxA6 interacting with EGFR, and elevated AnxA6 levels promoting PKCα membrane association and interaction with EGFR. Stable expression of the cytosolic N-terminal mutant AnxA61–175, which cannot promote PKCα membrane recruitment, does not increase T654-EGFR phosphorylation or the association of PKCα with EGFR. AnxA6 overexpression does not inhibit tyrosine phosphorylation of the T654A EGFR mutant, which cannot be phosphorylated by PKCα. Most strikingly, stable plasma membrane anchoring of AnxA6 is sufficient to recruit PKCα even in the absence of EGF or Ca2+. In summary, AnxA6 is a new PKCα scaffold to promote PKCα-mediated EGFR inactivation through increased membrane targeting of PKCα and EGFR/PKCα complex formation."
https://openalex.org/W1989268312,"CD97, a member of the adhesion family of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), complexes with and potentiates lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor signaling to the downstream effector RHOA. We show here that CD97 was expressed in a majority of thyroid cancers but not normal thyroid epithelium and that the level of CD97 expression was further elevated with progression to poorly differentiated and undifferentiated carcinoma. Intratumoral progression also showed that CD97 expression correlates with invasiveness and dedifferentiation. To determine the functional role of CD97, we produced a transgenic model of thyroglobulin promoter-driven CD97 expression. Transgenic CD97 in combination with Thrb(PV), an established mouse model of thyroid follicular cell carcinogenesis, significantly increased the occurrence of vascular invasion and lung metastasis. Expression of transgenic CD97 in thyroid epithelium led to elevated ERK phosphorylation and increased numbers of Ki67+ cells in developing tumors. In addition, tumor cell cultures derived from CD97 transgenic as compared with non-transgenic mice demonstrated enhanced, constitutive and LPA-stimulated ERK activation. In human thyroid cancer cell lines, CD97 depletion reduced RHO-GTP and decreased LPA-stimulated invasion but not EGF-stimulated invasion, further suggesting that CD97 influences an LPA-associated mechanism of progression. Consistent with the above, CD97 expression in human thyroid cancers correlated with LPA receptor and markers of aggressiveness including Ki67 and pAKT. This study shows an autonomous effect of CD97 on thyroid cancer progression and supports the investigation of this GPCR as a therapeutic target for these cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2054963100,"Oyster reefs are one of the most threatened marine habitats on earth, with habitat loss resulting from water quality degradation, coastal development, destructive fishing practices, overfishing, and storm impacts. For successful and sustainable oyster reef restoration efforts, it is necessary to choose sites that support long-term growth and survival of oysters. Selection of suitable sites is critically important as it can greatly influence mortality factors and may largely determine the ultimate success of the restoration project. The application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provides an effective methodology for identifying suitable sites for oyster reef restoration and removes much of the uncertainty involved in the sometimes trial and error selection process. This approach also provides an objective and quantitative tool for planning future oyster reef restoration efforts. The aim of this study was to develop a restoration suitability index model and reef quality index model to characterize locations based on their potential for successful reef restoration within the Mission-Aransas Estuary, Texas, USA. The restoration suitability index model focuses on salinity, temperature, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and depth, while the reef quality index model focuses on abundance of live oysters, dead shell, and spat. Size-specific Perkinsus marinus infection levels were mapped to illustrate general disease trends. This application was effective in identifying suitable sites for oyster reef restoration, is flexible in its use, and provides a mechanism for considering alternative approaches. The end product is a practical decision-support tool that can be used by coastal resource managers to improve oyster restoration efforts. As oyster reef restoration activities continue at small and large-scales, site selection criteria are critical for assisting stakeholders and managers and for maximizing long-term sustainability of oyster resources."
https://openalex.org/W2001600758,"Background Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) is a devastating disease characterized by increased pulmonary vascular resistance, smooth muscle and endothelial cell proliferation, perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, and in situ thrombosis. Circulating intravascular ATP, ADP, AMP and adenosine activate purinergic cell signaling pathways and appear to induce many of the same pathologic processes that underlie IPAH. Extracellular dephosphorylation of ATP to ADP and AMP occurs primarily via CD39 (ENTPD1), an ectonucleotidase found on the surface of leukocytes, platelets, and endothelial cells [1]. Microparticles are micron-sized phospholipid vesicles formed from the membranes of platelets and endothelial cells. Objectives: Studies here examine whether CD39 is an important microparticle surface nucleotidase, and whether patients with IPAH have altered microparticle-bound CD39 activity that may contribute to the pathophysiology of the disease. Methodology/ Principal Findings Kinetic parameters, inhibitor blocking experiments, and immunogold labeling with electron microscopy support the role of CD39 as a major nucleotidase on the surface of microparticles. Comparison of microparticle surface CD39 expression and nucleotidase activity in 10 patients with advanced IPAH and 10 healthy controls using flow cytometry and thin layer chromatograph demonstrate the following: 1) circulating platelet (CD39+CD31+CD42b+) and endothelial (CD39+CD31+CD42b−) microparticle subpopulations in patients with IPAH show increased CD39 expression; 2) microparticle ATPase and ADPase activity in patients with IPAH is increased. Conclusions/ Significance We demonstrate for the first time increased CD39 expression and function on circulating microparticles in patients with IPAH. Further research is needed to elucidate whether these findings identify an important trigger for the development of the disease, or reflect a physiologic response to IPAH."
https://openalex.org/W2056048083,"We conducted a selection signature analysis using the chicken 60k SNP chip in two chicken lines that had been divergently selected for abdominal fat content (AFC) for 11 generations. The selection signature analysis used multiple signals of selection, including long-range allele frequency differences between the lean and fat lines, long-range heterozygosity changes, linkage disequilibrium, haplotype frequencies, and extended haplotype homozygosity. Multiple signals of selection identified ten signatures on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 11, 15, 20, 26 and Z. The 0.73 Mb PC1/PCSK1 region of the Z chromosome at 55.43-56.16 Mb was the most heavily selected region. This region had 26 SNP markers and seven genes, Mar-03, SLC12A2, FBN2, ERAP1, CAST, PC1/PCSK1 and ELL2, where PC1/PCSK1 are the chicken/human names for the same gene. The lean and fat lines had two main haplotypes with completely opposite SNP alleles for the 26 SNP markers and were virtually line-specific, and had a recombinant haplotype with nearly equal frequency (0.193 and 0.196) in both lines. Other haplotypes in this region had negligible frequencies. Nine other regions with selection signatures were PAH-IGF1, TRPC4, GJD4-CCNY, NDST4, NOVA1, GALNT9, the ESRP2-GALR1 region with five genes, the SYCP2-CADH4 with six genes, and the TULP1-KIF21B with 14 genes. Genome-wide association analysis showed that nearly all regions with evidence of selection signature had SNP effects with genome-wide significance (P<10–6) on abdominal fat weight and percentage. The results of this study provide specific gene targets for the control of chicken AFC and a potential model of AFC in human obesity."
https://openalex.org/W2148011117,"Current thinking about LTP triggered in the area CA1 of hippocampal slices is ruled by two ""dogmas"": (1) A single train of high-frequency stimulation is sufficient to trigger short-lasting LTP (1-3 h), whereas multiple trains are required to induce long-lasting LTP (L-LTP, more than 4 h). (2) The development of the late phase of L-LTP requires the synthesis of new proteins. In this study, we found that a single high-frequency train could trigger an LTP lasting more than 8 h that was not affected by either anisomycin or cycloheximide (two inhibitors of protein synthesis). We ascertained that the induction of this L-LTP made use of the same mechanisms as those usually reported to be involved in LTP induction: it was dependent on NMDA receptors and on the activation of two ""core"" kinases, CaMKII and PI3K. These findings call into question the two ""dogmas"" about LTP."

The induction by four herbicides (2,4-D, atrazine, metolachlor and primisulfuron) and a herbicide safener (dichlormid) on the expression of three genes, ZmGST27, ZmGT1 and ZmMRP1, encoding respectively a glutathione-S-transferase, a glutathione transporter and an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter was studied in maize. The results demonstrate that the inducing effect on gene expression varies with both chemicals and genes. The expression of ZmGST27 and ZmMRP1 was up-regulated by all five compounds, whereas that of ZmGT1 was increased by atrazine, metolachlor, primisulfuron and dichlormid, but not by 2,4-D. For all chemicals, the inducing effect was first detected on ZmGST27. The finding that ZmGT1 is activated alongside ZmGST27 and ZmMRP1 suggests that glutathione transporters are an important component in the xenobiotic detoxification system of plants."

Recently, the association between genetic variations in STXBP5 and STX2 with VWF levels has been discovered in the general population. We assessed the relationship between genetic variations in STXBP5 and STX2, VWF levels, and bleeding phenotype in type 1 VWD patients.In 158 patients diagnosed with type 1 VWD according to the current ISTH guidelines, we genotyped three tagging-SNPs in STXBP5 and STX2 and analyzed their relationship with VWF:Ag levels and the severity of the bleeding phenotype, as assessed by the Tosetto bleeding score.In STX2, rs7978987 was significantly associated with VWF:Ag levels (bèta-coefficient (β) = -0.04 IU/mL per allele, [95%CI -0.07;-0.001], p = 0.04) and VWF:CB activity (β = -0.12 IU/mL per allele, [95%CI -0.17;-0.06], p<0.0001). For rs1039084 in STXBP5 a similar trend with VWF:Ag levels was observed: (β = -0.03 IU/mL per allele [95% CI -0.06;0.003], p = 0.07). In women, homozygous carriers of the minor alleles of both SNPs in STXBP5 had a significantly higher bleeding score than homozygous carriers of the major alleles. (Rs1039084 p = 0.01 and rs9399599 p = 0.02).Genetic variation in STX2 is associated with VWF:Ag levels in patients diagnosed with type 1 VWD. In addition, genetic variation in STXBP5 is associated with bleeding phenotype in female VWD patients. Our findings may partly explain the variable VWF levels and bleeding phenotype in type 1 VWD patients."

Several S. Typhimurium genomes have been completed and many more genome-sequencing projects are underway. Comparative genome analysis of the multiple strains leads to a better understanding of the evolution of S. Typhimurium and its pathogenesis. S. Typhimurium strain UK-1 (belongs to phage type 1) is highly virulent when orally administered to mice and chickens and efficiently colonizes lymphoid tissues of these species. These characteristics make this strain a good choice for use in vaccine development. In fact, UK-1 has been used as the parent strain for a number of nonrecombinant and recombinant vaccine strains, including several commercial vaccines for poultry. In this study, we conducted a thorough comparative genome analysis of the UK-1 strain with other S. Typhimurium strains and examined the phenotypic impact of several genomic differences. Whole genomic comparison highlights an extremely close relationship between the UK-1 strain and other S. Typhimurium strains; however, many interesting genetic and genomic variations specific to UK-1 were explored. In particular, the deletion of a UK-1-specific gene that is highly similar to the gene encoding the T3SS effector protein NleC exhibited a significant decrease in oral virulence in BALB/c mice. The complete genetic complements in UK-1, especially those elements that contribute to virulence or aid in determining the diversity within bacterial species, provide key information in evaluating the functional characterization of important genetic determinants and for development of vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1980143100,"The purpose of this study was to examine the role of RA Synovial Fibroblast (RASFib) IL-15 expression on B cell survival.Magnetically sorted peripheral blood memory B cells from 15 healthy subjects were cocultured with RASFib.RASFib constitutively expressed membrane IL-15. Survival of isolated B cells cultured for 6 days, below 5%, was extended in coculture with RASFib to 52+/-8% (p<0.001). IL-15 neutralizing agents but not isotype controls, reduced this rate to 31+/-6% (p<0.05). Interestingly, rhIL-15 had no effect on isolated B cells but significantly increased their survival in coculture with RASFib. In parallel, B cell IL-15R chains were upregulated in cocultures. BAFF and VCAM-1, that are expressed on RASFib, were tested as potential candidates involved in upregulating B cell IL-15R. Culture of B cells in the presence of rhBAFF or rhVCAM-1 resulted in significantly increased survival, together with upregulation of all three IL-15R chains; in parallel, rhIL-15 potentiated the anti-apoptotic effect of BAFF and VCAM-1. Both BAFF and VCAM-1 neutralizing agents downmodulated the effect of RASFib on B cell survival and IL-15R expression. In parallel, rhIL-15 had a lower effect on the survival of B cells cocultured with RASFib in the presence of BAFF or VCAM-1 neutralizing agents. Peripheral blood B cells from 15 early RA patients demonstrated an upregulated IL-15R and increased survival in cocultures.IL-15 expression on RASFib significantly contributes to the anti-apoptotic effect of RASFib on B cells. IL-15 action is facilitated by BAFF and VCAM-1 expressed on RASFib, through an upregulation of IL-15R chains."
https://openalex.org/W2036311654,"It has been widely accepted that ocular dominance in the responses of visual cortical neurons can change depending on visual experience in a postnatal period. However, experience-dependent plasticity for orientation selectivity, which is another important response property of visual cortical neurons, is not yet fully understood. To address this issue, using intrinsic signal imaging and two-photon calcium imaging we attempted to observe the alteration of orientation selectivity in the visual cortex of juvenile and adult mice reared with head-mounted goggles, through which animals can experience only the vertical orientation. After one week of goggle rearing, the density of neurons optimally responding to the exposed orientation increased, while that responding to unexposed orientations decreased. These changes can be interpreted as a reallocation of preferred orientations among visually responsive neurons. Our obtained sensitivity profile for orientation selectivity showed a marked peak at 5 weeks and sustained elevation at 12 weeks and later. These features indicate the existence of a critical period between 4 and 7 weeks and residual orientation plasticity in adult mice. The presence of a dip in the sensitivity profile at 10 weeks suggests that different mechanisms are involved in orientation plasticity in childhood and adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W2048473079,"Although it is well established that the coat protein complex II (COPII) mediates the transport of proteins and lipids from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, the regulation of the vesicular transport event and the mechanisms that act to counterbalance the vesicle flow between the ER and Golgi are poorly understood. In this study, we present data indicating that the penta-EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding protein Pef1p directly interacts with the COPII coat subunit Sec31p and regulates COPII assembly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. ALG-2, a mammalian homolog of Pef1p, has been shown to interact with Sec31A in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner and to have a role in stabilizing the association of the Sec13/31 complex with the membrane. However, Pef1p displayed reversed Ca(2+) dependence for Sec13/31p association; only the Ca(2+)-free form of Pef1p bound to the Sec13/31p complex. In addition, the influence on COPII coat assembly also appeared to be reversed; Pef1p binding acted as a kinetic inhibitor to delay Sec13/31p recruitment. Our results provide further evidence for a linkage between Ca(2+)-dependent signaling and ER-to-Golgi trafficking, but its mechanism of action in yeast seems to be different from the mechanism reported for its mammalian homolog ALG-2."
https://openalex.org/W1995065358,"Background The Wnt/β-Catenin signaling pathway is central for liver functions and frequently deregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Analysis of the early phenotypes and molecular events following β-Catenin activation is therefore essential for better understanding HCC pathogenesis. The AP-1 transcription factor c-Jun is a putative β-Catenin target gene and promotes hepatocyte survival, proliferation, and liver tumorigenesis, suggesting that c-Jun may be a key target of β-Catenin signaling in the liver. Methodology/Principal Findings To address this issue, the immediate hepatic phenotypes following deletion of the tumor suppressor Apc and subsequent β-Catenin activation were analyzed in mice. The contribution of c-Jun to these phenotypes was dissected in double mutant animals lacking both, Apc and c-Jun. β-Catenin was rapidly activated in virtually all Apc mutant hepatocytes while c-Jun was induced only after several days, suggesting that its expression was rather a secondary event following Apc deletion in the liver. Loss of Apc resulted in increased hepatocyte proliferation, hepatomegaly, deregulated protein metabolism, and premature death. Interestingly, additional deletion of c-Jun did not affect hepatocyte proliferation but resulted in increased liver damage and mortality. This phenotype correlated with impaired expression of hepatoprotective genes such as Birc5, Egfr Igf1 and subsequently deregulated Akt signaling. Conclusions/Significance These data indicate that c-Jun is not a primary target of β-Catenin signaling in the liver, but rather protects against liver damage, which in turn may promote liver tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2036259933,"Glucocorticoid induced-leucine zipper (GILZ) has been shown to be induced in cells by different stimuli such as glucocorticoids, IL-10 or deprivation of IL-2. GILZ has anti-inflammatory properties and may be involved in signalling modulating apoptosis. Herein we demonstrate that wildtype Yersinia enterocolitica which carry the pYV plasmid upregulated GILZ mRNA levels and protein expression in epithelial cells. Infection of HeLa cells with different Yersinia mutant strains revealed that the protease activity of YopT, which cleaves the membrane-bound form of Rho GTPases was sufficient to induce GILZ expression. Similarly, Clostridium difficile toxin B, another bacterial inhibitor of Rho GTPases induced GILZ expression. YopT and toxin B both increased transcriptional activity of the GILZ promoter in HeLa cells. GILZ expression could not be linked to the inactivation of an individual Rho GTPase by these toxins. However, forced expression of RhoA and RhoB decreased basal GILZ promoter activity. Furthermore, MAPK activation proved necessary for profound GILZ induction by toxin B. Promoter studies and gel shift analyses defined binding of upstream stimulatory factor (USF) 1 and 2 to a canonical c-Myc binding site (E-box) in the GILZ promoter as a crucial step of its trans-activation. In addition we could show that USF-1 and USF-2 are essential for basal as well as toxin B induced GILZ expression. These findings define a novel way of GILZ promoter trans-activation mediated by bacterial toxins and differentiate it from those mediated by dexamethasone or deprivation of IL-2."
https://openalex.org/W2082833982,"Background Integrins are a family of adhesion receptors which regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, leukocyte migration, and complement receptor-dependent phagocytosis. In invertebrates, as a cell adhesion receptor, β integrins play an important role for the balanced activation of immune defense responses especially during the encounter of infections. The present study attempts to characterize the immune functions of shrimp integrin (LvIntegrin) to have better understanding on the immune system and its regulation mechanisms in shrimps. Methodology A shrimp integrin was identified from the Pacific white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei (designated as LvIntegrin). Its full-length cDNA was of 2621 bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 2439 bp encoding a polypeptide of 812 amino acids. The mRNA expression of LvIntegrin was significantly up-regulated at 3, 6 and 12 h after Listonella anguillarum challenge. The cDNA fragment encoding β integrin domains (βA and hybrid domain) of LvIntegrin was recombined and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS. The recombinant protein (rLvIntegrin) could significantly agglutinate the tested microbe including E. coli JM109, L. anguillarum, Micrococcus luteus and Candida dattiladattila in the presence of divalent cations. Moreover, when NIH3T3 cells were cultured with rLvIntegrin, the proliferation rate increased significantly in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions LvIntegrin, a shrimp β integrin was identified from L. vannamei, shared several highly conserved features. LvIntegrin exhibited broad-spectrum agglutination activity towards both bacteria and fungi and could improve the proliferation of NIH3T3 cells, indicating that LvIntegrin is involved in the immune response against microbe challenge and regulation of cell proliferation as a cell adhesion receptor in shrimp."
https://openalex.org/W2035064666,"Anthracyclines and taxanes have remarkable anticancer efficacy, but have poor selectivity and high toxicity. Targeted delivery of chemotherapeutics has emerged as a strategy to achieve higher drug levels at the tumor site, to spare noncancerous tissue and potentially to use lower systemic drug doses, thus preventing side effects. In this study, we targeted the HER2 receptor using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) Herceptin (Trastuzumab) chemically conjugated to Doxorubicin or Taxol. In vitro, drug–Herceptin conjugates exhibited cytotoxicity comparable to equimolar concentrations of free drugs, with the benefit that the cytotoxicity of the conjugates was selective for cells expressing the HER2 target. In vivo, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with Taxol–Herceptin conjugates had a reduction of primary tumors comparable to equivalent doses of free drugs. However, Taxol–Herceptin conjugates significantly reduced metastasis compared with equivalent doses of free drugs. Thus, the data support the concept that conjugates might target metastasis better than primary tumors. This would offer a potential therapeutic approach for management of metastatic breast cancer."

Unlike the lactate oxidation processes observed in previous reports, the mechanism underlying lactate oxidation described in the present study excluded the costliness of the cofactor regeneration step and production of the byproduct hydrogen peroxide.Biocatalysis conditions were optimized by using the cheap dl-lactate as the substrate and whole cells of the lactate-utilizing P. stutzeri SDM as catalyst. Under optimal conditions, the biocatalytic process produced pyruvate at a high concentration (48.4 g l(-1)) and a high yield (98%).

Here, we used an animal irradiation model to investigate and define the molecular mechanisms affecting SGs following IR, focusing on saliva proteome and global transcription profile of submandibular salivary gland (SSG) tissue. We show that saliva secretion was gradually reduced to 50% of its initial level 12 weeks post-IR. Saliva protein composition was further examined by proteomic analysis following mass spectrometry (MS) analysis that revealed proteins with reduced expression originating from SSGs and proteins with increased expression derived from the serum, both indicating salivary tissue damage. To examine alterations in mRNA expression levels microarray analysis was performed. We found significant alterations in 95 genes, including cell-cycle arrest genes, SG functional genes and a DNA repair gene. Tissue damage was seen by confocal immunofluorescence of α-amylase and c-Kit that showed an increase and decrease, respectively, in protein expression. This was coherent with real-time PCR results. This data indicates that IR damages the SSG cells' ability to produce and secrete saliva and proteins, and maintain the physiological barrier between serum and saliva. The damage does not heal due to cell-cycle arrest, which prevents tissue regeneration. Taken together, our results reveal a new insight into IR pathobiology."
https://openalex.org/W1975289642,"Pathological bone resorption is a source of significant morbidity in diseases affecting the skeleton such as rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis, and cancer metastasis to bone. Evidence indicates that elevated levels of inflammatory mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α play a role in this process by promoting the formation of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. Additionally, current studies have identified inflammatory chemokines of the macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP) family as potential mediators of pathological bone resorption, where both MIP-1α and -3α have been shown to enhance osteoclast (OCL) development. In this study we provide evidence that MIP-1δ, whose expression is associated with renal cell carcinoma bone metastasis and rheumatoid arthritis, enhances OCL formation in vitro via a direct effect on OCL precursors. Consistent with this ability, exposure of OCL precursors to MIP-1δ resulted in the activation of PLCγ2 and NF-κB, two signaling pathways known to regulate OCL differentiation. Moreover, MIP-1δ induced expression and nuclear translocation of NFATc1, a master regulator of osteoclastogenesis, which was dependent on activation of both the PLCγ2 and NFκB signaling pathways. Lastly, consistent with in vitro studies, in vivo administration of MIP-1δ significantly increased OCL number and resorption area as determined using a murine calvarial bone resorption model. Taken together, these data highlight the potential of MIP-1δ as a mediator of pathological bone resorption and provide insight into the molecular mechanism through which MIP-1δ enhances osteoclastogenesis."
