https://openalex.org/W3015988827,"What happens next? Four months into the severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, we still do not know enough about postrecovery immune protection and environmental and seasonal influences on transmission to predict transmission dynamics accurately. However, we do know that humans are seasonally afflicted by other, less severe coronaviruses. Kissler et al. used existing data to build a deterministic model of multiyear interactions between existing coronaviruses, with a focus on the United States, and used this to project the potential epidemic dynamics and pressures on critical care capacity over the next 5 years. The long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 strongly depends on immune responses and immune cross-reactions between the coronaviruses, as well as the timing of introduction of the new virus into a population. One scenario is that a resurgence in SARS-CoV-2 could occur as far into the future as 2025. Science , this issue p. 860"

The outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria are naturally insulative and prevent the indiscriminate exchange of electrons between the cell and environment. However, a number of important bacterial processes require the conductance of electrons across the outer membrane. These include the transfer of intracellularly derived electrons out of the cell to external electron acceptors or the import of electrons into the cell from extracellular electron donors in order to support the formation of reducing equivalents for carbon fixation (Shi et al., 2016Shi L. Dong H. Reguera G. Beyenal H. Lu A. Liu J. Yu H.Q. Fredrickson J.K. Extracellular electron transfer mechanisms between microorganisms and minerals.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2016; 14: 651-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). The ability to directly transfer electrons into and out of bacterial cells is also of increasing interest for biotechnological applications including microbial fuel cells, microbial electrosynthesis, unbalanced fermentation, and bio-electronic interfaces (Bursac et al., 2017Bursac T.

Microbial electrosynthesis - revisiting the electrical route for microbial production.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2010; 8: 706-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, this process requires electrons to be transported across the outer membrane of the cell in a controlled pathway that prevents detrimental redox side reactions, such as the generation of reactive oxygen species. Thus, an “insulated” electron transfer complex is required. The Gram-negative Shewanella is one of the most studied bacterial genera capable of transferring electrons out of the cell to solid-phase Fe(III) and Mn(IV) minerals in order to support anaerobic respiration (Beblawy et al., 2018Beblawy S.

We have previously purified an icosaheme protein complex comprising three subunits (MtrA, MtrB, MtrC) from the outer membrane of Shewanella oneidensis and shown that this Mtr complex is able to conduct electrons bidirectionally across proteoliposome bilayers sustaining electron transport rates over 8,500 e s–1 (White et al., 2013White G.F. Shi Z. Shi L. Wang Z. Dohnalkova A.C. Marshall M.J. Fredrickson J.K. Zachara J.M. Butt J.N. Richardson D.J. Clarke T.A.

In liposome studies, the direction of electron transfer is dependent on the relative redox potentials across the membrane. Extraliposomal sodium dithionite is capable of reducing intraliposomal methyl viologen or small tetraheme cytochrome (STC), which can then be used to reduce extravesicular iron oxides and chelates (Edwards et al., 2018Edwards M.J. White G.F. Lockwood C.W. Lawes M.C. Martel A. Harris G. Scott D.J. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. Clarke T.A.

USA. 2013; 110: 6346-6351Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The reduction potentials of the 20 hemes in the S. oneidensis Mtr complex span from approximately 0 to −400 mV versus SHE. This allows the complex to accept electrons from the menaquinol dehydrogenase CymA, via the periplasmic cytochromes small tetraheme cytochrome (STC) and periplasmic fumarate reductase (FccA), and transfer them to extracellular soluble and insoluble electron acceptors (Figure S1A). Within this complex, the ten heme MtrC is the cell-surface module required when solid-phase minerals serve as terminal electron acceptors (Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010Coursolle D. Gralnick J.A.

Chem. 2007; 12: 1083-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). MtrAB is proposed to span the outer membrane and provide electrical connection between the catabolic electron transfer network within the cell, and the electron dispersing MtrC outside the cell (Edwards et al., 2018Edwards M.J. White G.F. Lockwood C.W. Lawes M.C. Martel A. Harris G. Scott D.J. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. Clarke T.A.

Despite these findings, critical information about the complex, including the topology and interactions of all three components, has been missing until now. Here, we present the structure of an Mtr complex at 2.7 Å resolution. This structure reveals MtrAB to be a naturally insulated molecular wire that is able to conduct electrons across the lipidic outer membrane and deliver them to MtrC, which positions its hemes to optimize electron distribution to extracellular redox partners. Despite multiple attempts, the Mtr complex from S. oneidensis could not be crystallized. However, homologous Mtr complexes are produced endogenously by different Shewanella species (Fredrickson et al., 2008Fredrickson J.K. Romine M.F. Beliaev A.S. Auchtung J.M. Driscoll M.E. Gardner T.S. Nealson K.H. Osterman A.L. Pinchuk G. Reed J.L. et al.Towards environmental systems biology of Shewanella.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2008; 6: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar) and screening of several of these provided a single crystallizable hit. The Mtr complex from Shewanella baltica OS185 produced crystals that diffracted to a final resolution of 2.7 Å, and data were phased utilizing the anomalous signal from the 20 iron atoms of the c-type hemes (Table 1; Figure S1). The crystal structure reveals a heterotrimeric complex that consists of two cytochromes, MtrC and MtrA, and a beta-barrel protein, MtrB, that sheathes and insulates MtrA (Figure 1A). A network of 20 bis-His coordinated hemes spans the complex, forming an electron transfer pathway of 185 Å (Figure 1B). The hemes of MtrA and MtrC are annotated in order of the CxxCH binding motifs to which they are connected, e.g., heme A1 binds to the first motif in the MtrA amino acid sequence and heme C1 binds to the first motif in the MtrC sequence (Figures 1B and 2A ).Table 1Data Collection and Refinement StatisticsData CollectionMtrC SADMtrCAB SADMtrCAB NativeaStatistics for data collection prior to anisotropic correction utilizing STARANISO.

Hemes A1 to A10 of MtrA are arranged such that neighboring pairs have alternating parallel and perpendicular porphyrin ring planes for which the closest edge-edge distances lie between 3.9 and 6.5 Å (Figure 2B). Similar configurations are found in the heme chains of smaller cytochromes from Shewanella and other bacteria. The heme chain of STC (Leys et al., 2002Leys D. Meyer T.E. Tsapin A.S. Nealson K.H. Cusanovich M.A. Van Beeumen J.J. Crystal structures at atomic resolution reveal the novel concept of “electron-harvesting” as a role for the small tetraheme cytochrome c.J. Biol.

The pentaheme chain of NrfB from Escherichia coli (Clarke et al., 2007Clarke T.A. Cole J.A. Richardson D.J. Hemmings A.M.

The sequence identity between STC and MtrA in the aligned regions is only 22%–23%, and the corresponding sequence identity between NrfB and MtrA is only 33%. However, the conservation of the heme arrangement observed in these structures suggests that STC, NrfB, and MtrA might share a common ancestor, with MtrA arising from a gene duplication. The arrangement of MtrA heme A9 and A10 cannot be superposed on hemes from either STC or NrfB, possibly because the orientation of heme A10 has altered to facilitate electron transfer to extracellular MtrC. The hemes of STC and NrfB are redox active within the same potential window as MtrA, specifically 0 to −400 mV versus SHE (Clarke et al., 2004Clarke T.A. Dennison V. Seward H.E. Burlat B. Cole J.A.

Chem. 2008; 13: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and a maximum electron flux of 3 × 106 s–1 though hemes 1–4 of STC has been calculated (Jiang et al., 2017Jiang X. Futera Z. Ali M.E. Gajdos F. von Rudorff G.F. Carof A. Breuer M. Blumberger J. Cysteine Linkages Accelerate Electron Flow through Tetra-Heme Protein STC.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2017; 139: 17237-17240Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in agreement with measurements of heme-heme electron transfer rates in that protein (van Wonderen, 2019van Wonderen Jessica Ultrafast Light-Driven Electron Transfer in a Ru(II)tris(bipyridine)-Labeled Multiheme Cytochrome.Journal American Chemical Society. 2019; : 15190https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.9b06858Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Thus, MtrA may support similarly rapid electron transfer across the 80 Å heme chain between heme A1 and heme A10. This distance is more than sufficient to facilitate the collection of electrons originating within the periplasm, transport across the ∼40 Å outer cell membrane and delivery to the extracellular environment. The MtrA polypeptide has very little secondary structure, with only 20% of the polypeptide chain composed of helices and the remaining 80% consisting of flexible loops (Figure 2A; Figure S2). This is consistent with previous small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of isolated MtrA in solution (Firer-Sherwood et al., 2011Firer-Sherwood M.A. Ando N. Drennan C.L. Elliott S.J. Solution-based structural analysis of the decaheme cytochrome, MtrA, by small-angle X-ray scattering and analytical ultracentrifugation.J. Phys. Chem. B. 2011; 115: 11208-11214Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Kratky analysis of these data revealed a peak at low scattering angles, consistent with a folded protein, but increased at higher scattering angles consistent with a flexible MtrA. As a component of the Mtr crystal structure, the flexibility of MtrA can be observed through the temperature (B) factors of the peptide backbone, where higher values are associated with increased chain mobility. The B factors of MtrA increase from the externally facing C terminus to the periplasmic facing N terminus (Figure 2C; Figure S3). Loops in the C-terminal half of the MtrA form hydrogen bonds with internally facing charged MtrB side chains, restricting mobility. In contrast, the interactions between the N-terminal half of MtrA and MtrB are much less extensive, which increases the mobility of the periplasmic facing side of MtrA. The MtrA N terminus is the most mobile region and projects out of MtrB into the periplasmic compartment, with heme A1 located approximately 20 Å inside the periplasm. This could facilitate interactions between heme A1 and soluble periplasmic proteins such as STC and fumarate reductase FccA, which have been previously shown to be electron donors to MtrA (Edwards et al., 2018Edwards M.J. White G.F. Lockwood C.W. Lawes M.C. Martel A. Harris G. Scott D.J. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. Clarke T.A.

A dynamic periplasmic electron transfer network enables respiratory flexibility beyond a thermodynamic regulatory regime.ISME J. 2015; 9: 1802-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Solubility of the Mtr complex in the lipidic outer membrane is conferred by MtrB, a hydrophobic barrel comprised of 26 antiparallel β strands (Figures 1A and 3). The interactions between MtrB and MtrA allow MtrA to be positioned across the outer membrane while insulating the MtrA hemes from the outer membrane environment, preventing non-specific reduction of membrane soluble exogenous molecules such as oxygen, which could result in the generation of reactive oxygen species that in turn lead to cellular damage (e.g., lipid peroxidation). The MtrB porin orients MtrA so the heme chain is perpendicular to the membrane and electron transfer away from the cell is optimized. MtrB, with overall dimensions of approximately 70 × 55 × 45 Å, consists of tight turns on the periplasmic face and surface loops extending ∼45 Å on the extracellular side of the membrane. The overall structure of MtrB is similar to that of other outer membrane secretion proteins (e.g., Figure 3). For example, MtrB is approximately the same size as the 26-strand lipopolysaccharide transporter LptD, and the 24-strand pilin subunit transporter FimD (Botos et al., 2016Botos I. Majdalani N. Mayclin S.J. McCarthy J.G. Lundquist K. Wojtowicz D. Barnard T.J. Gumbart J.C. Buchanan S.K.

Yan J. et al.Crystal structure of the FimD usher bound to its cognate FimC-FimH substrate.Nature. 2011; 474: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) (Figure 3). The amino acid composition of the extracellular loops gives the MtrB surface a uniform negative charge. Structural modeling of the Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 porins MtrE and DmsF reveals that, while the negatively charged extracellular surfaces are conserved in the MtrB protein family (Figure 4), they are not observed in electrostatic surface maps of the aforementioned FimD and LptD β-barrel proteins (Figure 3). Like MtrB, DmsF and MtrE are components of outer membrane electron transport complexes that contain extracellular catalytic domains, in these cases DmsAB and MtrF, respectively (White et al., 2016White G.F. Edwards M.J. Gomez-Perez L. Richardson D.J. Butt J.N. Clarke T.A. Mechanisms of Bacterial Extracellular Electron Exchange.Adv. Microb. Physiol. 2016; 68: 87-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). It is therefore likely that for MtrB and its homologs these negatively charged residues help in the docking of the extracellular catalytic domains, possibly by preventing the negatively charged Shewanella lipopolysaccharide (Korenevsky et al., 2002Korenevsky A.A. Vinogradov E. Gorby Y. Beveridge T.J. Characterization of the lipopolysaccharides and capsules of Shewanella spp.Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 4653-4657Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) from binding to the external surface of the membrane embedded porin:cytochrome complexes. The aperture of the pore defined by MtrB is wider at the periplasmic face (∼30 Å) than at the cell exterior (∼15 Å) where access to the outside is restricted by the folded surface loops (Figures 3 and 5A ). The pore is of sufficient size to allow folded MtrA (∼80 × 30 × 35 Å) to insert into the periplasmic opening of MtrB but prevents MtrA from escaping to the cell exterior, effectively trapping it inside MtrB. Thus, assembly of the full Mtr complex is dependent on “stalled” excretion of MtrA by MtrB, and association with MtrC that is translocated across the outer membrane by the type 2 secretion system (Shi et al., 2008Shi L. Deng S. Marshall M.J. Wang Z. Kennedy D.W. Dohnalkova A.C. Mottaz H.M. Hill E.A. Gorby Y.A. Beliaev A.S. et al.Direct involvement of type II secretion system in extracellular translocation of Shewanella oneidensis outer membrane cytochromes MtrC and OmcA.J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5512-5516Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). At the N terminus of MtrB, the first four β strands are shorter than the following 22 strands. Predicted to lie within the lipid bilayer, these shorter strands do not interact with MtrA and define a small solvent channel that runs between MtrA and MtrB (Figure 5B). The diameter of the periplasmic facing side of the channel is ∼5 Å, sufficient to allow free diffusion of water in and out of the periplasmic facing side of MtrB. The channel is capped at the extracellular surface of the outer membrane by a small α helix formed by the MtrB surface loop between β strands 1 and 2 (Figure 5C). This helix is stabilized by several hydrogen bonds, including two between Asn71 and the backbone of Tyr133 on β strand 5. The conserved Trp204 of MtrA is positioned underneath the cap and causes a bottleneck that restricts diffusion of charged and polar molecules from the extracellular face of the channel. However, there are polar residues, Asn71 of MtrB, and Gln206 of MtrA, that could stabilize water molecules on either side of the channel and a charged residue Asp107 that could participate in proton exchange. The role of this channel is unclear, but it may allow for proton transport that has been suggested to occur through the Mtr complex during anaerobic respiration (Okamoto et al., 2017Okamoto A. Tokunou Y. Kalathil S. Hashimoto K. Proton Transport in the Outer-Membrane Flavocytochrome Complex Limits the Rate of Extracellular Electron Transport.Angew. Chem. Int. Engl. 2017; 56: 9082-9086Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). At the cell surface, the surface loops of MtrB largely cover MtrA so that only MtrA residues 284 to 306 and heme A10 are presented for interaction with MtrC (Figure 5D). Interprotein electron transfer from heme A10 is facilitated by the positioning of MtrC heme C5 within an edge-edge distance of 8 Å. The amino acid sequence around heme C5 is highly conserved within the MtrC clade of outer membrane cytochromes (Figure S4). This conserved sequence contains residues that form hydrogen bonds with MtrAB, allowing association of MtrC to the surface of MtrAB. In the absence of MtrC, the exposed edge of the heme A10 porphyrin indicates that reduction of extracellular substrates by MtrAB should be possible and is consistent with previous studies that showed MtrC knockout mutants of S. oneidensis were capable of reduction of soluble Fe(III) chelates but not of insoluble iron oxides (Coursolle and Gralnick, 2010Coursolle D. Gralnick J.A. Modularity of the Mtr respiratory pathway of Shewanella oneidensis strain MR-1.Mol. Microbiol. 2010; 77: 995-1008PubMed Google Scholar). To aid initial model building for the Mtr complex, an X-ray crystal structure was obtained for a soluble form of S. baltica OS185 MtrC (MtrCsol). The structure of the monomeric MtrCsol was similar to that of MtrC from S. oneidensis MR-1 described previously (Edwards et al., 2015Edwards M.J. White G.F. Norman M. Tome-Fernandez A. Ainsworth E. Shi L. Fredrickson J.K. Zachara J.M. Butt J.N. Richardson D.J. et al.Redox Linked Flavin Sites in Extracellular Decaheme Proteins Involved in Microbe-Mineral Electron Transfer.Sci. Rep. 2015; (Published online July 1, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1038/srep11677Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). MtrCsol consists of 4 domains: two split beta-barrel domains, domains I and III, and two α-helical domains, domains II and IV. These domains serve as a scaffold for 10 bis-His coordinated hemes arranged in a “staggered cross” formation (Edwards et al., 2015Edwards M.J. White G.F. Norman M. Tome-Fernandez A. Ainsworth E. Shi L. Fredrickson J.K. Zachara J.M. Butt J.N. Richardson D.J. et al.Redox Linked Flavin Sites in Extracellular Decaheme Proteins Involved in Microbe-Mineral Electron Transfer.Sci. Rep. 2015; (Published online July 1, 2015)https://doi.org/10.1038/srep11677Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The three MtrCsol monomers within the asymmetric unit of the crystal displayed domain I/II movements relative to domains III/IV. These domain movements centered round a hinge region formed by residues 289–300 located within the alpha helix linking domains II and III. The location of the hinge point suggests this range of motion would not be restricted in the Mtr complex, giving conformational flexibility to MtrC. Analysis by DynDom (Hayward and Lee, 2002Hayward S. Lee R.A. Improvements in the analysis of domain motions in proteins from conformational change: DynDom version 1.50.J. Mol. Graph. Model. 2002; 21: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar) showed a maximal rotation of 15 degrees (Figure S5A) and that changes in relative orientation of hemes C1 and C6 were accompanied by <1 Å change in the edge-to-edge distance of the corresponding porphyrin rings (Figure S5B). In the Mtr complex, MtrC is angled on the surface of MtrAB so that the more insulated side of MtrC faces the membrane surface, while the negatively charged heme propionates face toward the environment thereby providing a suitable surface for direct electron transfer to large extracellular substrates (Figure 1). Heme C10 is presented to the environment ∼90 Å above the hydrophobic bilayer core and is located close to the PTPTD amino acid sequence previously identified as a possible hematite binding hydroxylated motif (Lower et al., 2008Lower B.H. Lins R.D. Oestreicher Z. Straatsma T.P. Hochella Jr., M.F. Shi L. Lower S.K. In vitro evolution of a peptide with a hematite binding motif that may constitute a natural metal-oxide binding archetype.Environ. Sci. Technol. 2008; 42: 3821-3827Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar); therefore, this may be a primary route for direct electron transfer to insoluble substrates. Previously, modeling of the electronic micro-environments of MtrC suggested that the net driving force between hemes C5 and C10 is rather small, allowing for bi-directional electron transfer through the heme chain formed by C5, C4, C3, C1, C6, C8, C9, and C10 (Figure 1B) (Barrozo et al., 2018Barrozo A.

However, the redox potentials of hemes C2 and C7 are higher than the other hemes, raising the possibility that these hemes serve as bot"
https://openalex.org/W3015422409,"Forming long-term memory (LTM) often requires repetitive experience spread over time. Studies in Drosophila suggest aversive olfactory LTM is optimal after spaced training, multiple trials of differential odor conditioning with rest intervals. Memory after spaced training is frequently compared to that after the same number of trials without intervals. Here we show that, after spaced training, flies acquire additional information and form an aversive memory for the shock-paired odor and a slowly emerging and more persistent ""safety-memory"" for the explicitly unpaired odor. Safety-memory acquisition requires repetition, order, and spacing of the training trials and relies on triggering specific rewarding dopaminergic neurons. Co-existence of aversive and safety memories is evident as depression of odor-specific responses at different combinations of junctions in the mushroom body output network; combining two outputs appears to signal relative safety. Having complementary aversive and safety memories augments LTM performance after spaced training by making the odor preference more certain."
https://openalex.org/W3015986655,"Soil salinization is a serious problem for cultivation of rice, as among cereals rice is the most salt sensitive crop, and more than 40% of the total agricultural land amounting to approximately 80 million ha the world over is salt affected. Salinity affects a plant in a varieties of ways, including ion toxicity, osmotic stress and oxidative damage. Since miRNAs occupy the top place in biochemical events determining a trait, understanding their role in salt tolerance is highly desirable, which may allow introduction of the trait in the rice cultivars of choice through biotechnological interventions. High throughput sequencing of sRNAs in the root and shoot tissues of the seedlings of the control and NaCl treated Pokkali, a salt-tolerant rice variety, identified 75 conserved miRNAs and mapped 200 sRNAs to the rice genome as novel miRNAs. Expression of nine novel miRNAs and two conserved miRNAs were confirmed by Northern blotting. Several of both conserved and novel miRNAs that expressed differentially in root and/or shoot tissues targeted transcription factors like AP2/EREBP domain protein, ARF, NAC, MYB, NF-YA, HD-Zip III, TCP and SBP reported to be involved in salt tolerance or in abiotic stress tolerance in general. Most of the novel miRNAs expressed in the salt tolerant wild rice Oryza coarctata, suggesting conservation of miRNAs in taxonomically related species. One of the novel miRNAs, osa-miR12477, also targeted L-ascorbate oxidase (LAO), indicating build-up of oxidative stress in the plant upon salt treatment, which was confirmed by DAB staining. Thus, salt tolerance might involve miRNA-mediated regulation of 1) cellular abundance of the hormone signaling components like EREBP and ARF, 2) synthesis of abiotic stress related transcription factors, and 3) antioxidative component like LAO for mitigation of oxidative damage. The study clearly indicated importance of osa-miR12477 regulated expression of LAO in salt tolerance in the plant."
https://openalex.org/W3016181576,"Abstract Pancreatic stellate cells (PSCs) secrete high levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) that contributes to the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). TGF-β1 modulates the expression of L1 cell adhesion molecule (L1CAM), but its role in tumour progression still remains controversial. To clarify L1 function in PDAC and cellular phenotypes, we performed L1CAM cell sorting, silencing and overexpression in several primary pancreatic cancer cells. PSCs silenced for TGF-β1 were used for crosstalk experiments. We found that TGF-β1 secreted by PSCs negatively regulates L1CAM expression, through canonical TGF-β-Smad2/3 signalling, leading to a more aggressive PDAC phenotype. Cells with reduced expression of L1CAM harboured enhanced stemness potential and tumourigenicity. Inactivation of TGF-β1 signalling in PSCs strongly reduced the aggressiveness of PDAC cells. Our data provide functional proof and mechanistic insights for the tumour-suppressive function of L1CAM via reducing stemness. Rescuing L1CAM expression in cancer cells through targeting of TGF-β1 reverses stemness and bears the potential to improve the still miserable prognosis of PDAC patients."
https://openalex.org/W3015386026,"Assessing the well-being of an animal is hindered by the limitations of efficient communication between humans and animals. Instead of direct communication, a variety of parameters are employed to evaluate the well-being of an animal. Especially in the field of biomedical research, scientifically sound tools to assess pain, suffering, and distress for experimental animals are highly demanded due to ethical and legal reasons. For mice, the most commonly used laboratory animals, a valuable tool is the Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS), a coding system for facial expressions of pain in mice. We aim to develop a fully automated system for the surveillance of post-surgical and post-anesthetic effects in mice. Our work introduces a semi-automated pipeline as a first step towards this goal. A new data set of images of black-furred laboratory mice that were moving freely is used and provided. Images were obtained after anesthesia (with isoflurane or ketamine/xylazine combination) and surgery (castration). We deploy two pre-trained state of the art deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (ResNet50 and InceptionV3) and compare to a third CNN architecture without pre-training. Depending on the particular treatment, we achieve an accuracy of up to 99% for the recognition of the absence or presence of post-surgical and/or post-anesthetic effects on the facial expression."
https://openalex.org/W3015222149,"This study explored the muscle genome-wide response to long-term unloading (84-day bed rest) in 21 men. We hypothesized that a part of the bed rest-induced gene expression signature would be resilient to a concurrent flywheel resistance exercise (RE) countermeasure. Using DNA microarray technology analyzing 35 345 gene-level probe-sets, we identified 335 annotated probe-sets that were downregulated, and 315 that were upregulated after bed rest (P < .01). Besides a predictable differential expression of genes and pathways related to mitochondria (downregulation; false-discovery rates (FDR) <1E-04), ubiquitin system (upregulation; FDR = 3E-02), and skeletal muscle energy metabolism and structure (downregulation; FDR ≤ 3E-03), 84-day bed rest also altered circadian rhythm regulation (upregulation; FDR = 3E-02). While most of the bed rest-induced changes were counteracted by RE, 209 transcripts were resilient to the exercise countermeasure. Genes upregulated after bed rest were particularly resistant to training (P < .001 vs downregulated, non-reversed genes). Specifically, “Translation Factors,” “Proteasome Degradation,” “Cell Cycle,” and “Nucleotide Metabolism” pathways were not normalized by RE. This study provides an unbiased high-throughput transcriptomic signature of one of the longest unloading periods in humans to date. Classical disuse-related changes in structural and metabolic genes/pathways were identified, together with a novel upregulation of circadian rhythm transcripts. In the context of previous bed rest campaigns, the latter seemed to be related to the duration of unloading, suggesting the transcriptomic machinery continues to adapt throughout extended disuse periods. Despite that the RE training offset most of the bed rest-induced muscle-phenotypic and transcriptomic alterations, we contend that the human skeletal muscle also displays a residual transcriptomic signature of unloading that is resistant to an established exercise countermeasure."

We also estimated the phase-specific costs by cancer type, stage at diagnosis, and treatment modality.We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database to identify patients aged 66 or older diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer between 2000-2013, with follow-up to death or December 31, 2014. We divided the patient's experience into separate phases of care: staging or surgery, initial, continuing, and terminal. We calculated total, cancer-attributable, and patient-liability costs. We fit logistic regression models to determine predictors of treatment receipt and fit linear regression models to determine relative costs. All costs are reported in 2019 US dollars.Our cohort included 90,023 colon cancer patients and 25,581 rectal cancer patients. After controlling for patient and clinical characteristics, Non-Hispanic Blacks were less likely to receive treatment but were more likely to have higher cancer-attributable costs within different phases of care. Overall, in both the colon and rectal cancer cohorts, mean monthly cost estimates were highest in the terminal phase, next highest in the staging phase, decreased in the initial phase, and were lowest in the continuing phase.Racial/ethnic disparities in treatment utilization and costs persist among colorectal cancer patients. Additionally, colorectal cancer costs are substantial and vary widely among stages and treatment modalities. This study provides information regarding cost and treatment disparities that can be used to guide clinical interventions and future resource allocation to reduce colorectal cancer burden."
https://openalex.org/W3015702244,"People’s beliefs about emotions may be grouped into two main categories: beliefs about the controllability of emotions and beliefs about the usefulness of emotions. These beliefs influence emotion regulation efforts and mental health, so the assessment of these beliefs is important. However, few psychometric measures are available, particularly for assessing the usefulness dimension. In this study (N = 161), we address this issue by developing and conducting an initial validation of a 16-item self-report measure called the Emotion Beliefs Questionnaire (EBQ). Confirmatory factor analyses found its structure to consist of three first-order factors: a controllability factor spanning both negatively and positively valenced emotions (General-Controllability), and two valence-specific usefulness factors (Negative-Usefulness, Positive-Usefulness). All first-order factors also loaded together on a higher-order factor, representing an overall maladaptive beliefs about emotions construct. All subscale and composite scores had good levels of internal consistency. Correlational and regression analyses found that EBQ scores related in expected ways with other measures, and were significant predictors of emotion regulation abilities and psychopathology. We conclude that the beliefs about emotions construct is multidimensional, and the EBQ appears to be a promising new tool to assess it."
https://openalex.org/W3016159377,"Reducing unplanned readmissions is a major focus of current hospital quality efforts. In order to avoid unfair penalization, administrators and policymakers use prediction models to adjust for the performance of hospitals from healthcare claims data. Regression-based models are a commonly utilized method for such risk-standardization across hospitals; however, these models often suffer in accuracy. In this study we, compare four prediction models for unplanned patient readmission for patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive health failure (HF), and pneumonia (PNA) within the Nationwide Readmissions Database in 2014. We evaluated hierarchical logistic regression and compared its performance with gradient boosting and two models that utilize artificial neural networks. We show that unsupervised Global Vector for Word Representations embedding representations of administrative claims data combined with artificial neural network classification models improves prediction of 30-day readmission. Our best models increased the AUC for prediction of 30-day readmissions from 0.68 to 0.72 for AMI, 0.60 to 0.64 for HF, and 0.63 to 0.68 for PNA compared to hierarchical logistic regression. Furthermore, risk-standardized hospital readmission rates calculated from our artificial neural network model that employed embeddings led to reclassification of approximately 10% of hospitals across categories of hospital performance. This finding suggests that prediction models that incorporate new methods classify hospitals differently than traditional regression-based approaches and that their role in assessing hospital performance warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3015337510,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are an important component of the tumor microenvironment and contribute to tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. Microfibrillar-associated protein 5 (MFAP5), a component of elastic microfibers and an oncogenic protein in several types of tumors, is secreted by CAFs. However, the role of MFAP5 in the bladder cancer remains unclear. Here, we report that MFAP5 is upregulated in bladder cancer and is associated with poor patient survival. Downregulation of MFAP5 in CAFs led to an impairment in proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells. Luciferase reporter assays and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) showed QKI directly downregulates MFAP5 in CAFs. In addition, CAFs-derived MFAP5 led to an activation of the NOTCH2/HEY1 signaling pathway through direct interaction with the NOTCH2 receptor, thereby stimulating the N2ICD release. RNA-sequencing revealed that MFAP5-mediated PI3K-AKT signaling activated the DLL4/NOTCH2 pathway axis in bladder cancer. Moreover, downregulation of NOTCH2 by short hairpin RNA or the inactivating anti-body NRR2Mab was able to reverse the adverse effects of MFAP5 stimulation in vitro and in vivo. Together, these results demonstrate CAFs-derived MFAP5 promotes the bladder cancer proliferation and metastasis and provides new insight for targeting CAFs as novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3016195349,"Adipose tissue dysregulation in obesity strongly influences systemic metabolic homeostasis and is often linked to insulin resistance (IR). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying adipose tissue dysfunction in obesity are not fully understood. Herein, a proteomic analysis of subcutaneous (SC) and omental (OM) fat from lean subjects and obese individuals with different degrees of insulin sensitivity was performed to identify adipose tissue biomarkers related to obesity-associated metabolic disease. Our results suggest that dysregulation of both adipose tissue extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and intracellular trafficking processes may be associated with IR in obesity. Thus, abnormal accumulation of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan, lumican, as observed in SC fat of IR obese individuals, modifies collagen I organization, impairs adipogenesis and activates stress processes [endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress] in adipocytes. In OM fat, IR is associated with increased levels of the negative regulator of the Rab family of small GTPases, GDI2, which alters lipid storage in adipocytes by inhibiting insulin-stimulated binding of the Rab protein, Rab18, to lipid droplets. Together, these results indicate that lumican and GDI2 might play depot-dependent, pathogenic roles in obesity-associated IR. Our findings provide novel insights into the differential maladaptive responses of SC and OM adipose tissue linking obesity to IR."
https://openalex.org/W3015250703,"The mitochondrial HSP70 chaperone mortalin (HSPA9/GRP75) is often upregulated and mislocalized in MEK/ERK-deregulated tumors. Here, we show that mortalin depletion can selectively induce death of immortalized normal fibroblasts IMR90E1A when combined with K-RasG12V expression, but not with wild-type K-Ras expression, and that K-RasG12V-driven MEK/ERK activity is necessary for this lethality. This cell death was attenuated by knockdown or inhibition of adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT), cyclophilin D (CypD), or mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU), which implicates a mitochondria-originated death mechanism. Indeed, mortalin depletion increased mitochondrial membrane permeability and induced cell death in KRAS-mutated human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and colon cancer lines, which were attenuated by knockdown or inhibition of ANT, CypD, or MCU, and occurred independently of TP53 and p21CIP1. Intriguingly, JG-98, an advanced MKT-077 derivative, phenocopied the lethal effects of mortalin depletion in K-RasG12V-expressing IMR90E1A and KRAS-mutated tumor cell lines in vitro. Moreover, JG-231, a JG-98 analog with improved microsomal stability effectively suppressed the xenograft of MIA PaCa-2, a K-RasG12C-expressing human PDAC line, in athymic nude mice. These data demonstrate that oncogenic KRAS activity sensitizes cells to the effects of mortalin depletion, suggesting that mortalin has potential as a selective therapeutic target for KRAS-mutated tumors."
https://openalex.org/W3015613483,"Resident microglia of the central nervous system are being increasingly recognized as key players in diseases such as neuropathic pain. Biochemical and behavioral studies in neuropathic pain rodent models have documented compelling evidence of the critical role of ATP mediated-P2X4R-brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling pathway in the initiation and maintenance of pain hypersensitivity, a feature driving neuropathic pain-related behavior. The goal of this study was to develop and characterize an in vitro cell line model of activated microglia that can be subsequently utilized for screening neuropathic pain therapeutics. In the present study, we characterized the SIM-A9 microglia cell line for key molecules in the P2X4R-BDNF signaling axis using a combination of biochemical techniques and developed an ATP-activated SIM-A9 microglia model. We present three novel findings: first, SIM-A9 cells expressed P2X4R and BDNF proteins, second, ATP, but not LPS, was cytocompatible with SIM-A9 cells and third, exposure of cells to optimized ATP concentrations for defined periods increased intracellular expression of Iba1 and BDNF proteins. Increased Iba1 levels confirmed microglia activation and increased BDNF expression confirmed ATP-mediated stimulation of the P2X4R signaling pathway. We propose that this ATP-activated SIM-A9 cell line model system can be utilized for screening both small- as well as macro-molecular neuropathic pain therapeutics targeting BDNF and/or P2X4R knockdown."

We investigated the prevalence and time trends in repeat adolescent birth in Uganda, and associated factors. Methods We analyzed Uganda Demographic and Health Survey data of women age 20–24 years collected on 6 surveys (1988/89-2016) to estimate repeat adolescent birth (first live birth <18 years of age followed by another live birth(s) <20 years). Further, we estimated the wantedness of the second order birth and the prevalence of short birth intervals birth (<13 months) between the first and second such birth. On the 2016 survey, we examined factors associated with repeat adolescent birth using bivariate and multivariate modified Poisson regression. Results At the 1988/89 survey, 58.9% of women with first birth <18 years reported a repeat adolescent birth. This percentage increased to 66.8% in 2006 (+7.9 percentage points [pp], p = 0.010) and thereafter declined to 55.6% by 2016 (-11.2 pp, p<0.001), nevertheless, no change occurred between 1988/89 and 2016 (-3.3pp, p = 0.251). Among women with repeat adolescent births, the mean number of live births by exact age 20 years (2.2 births) and prevalence of short birth intervals (3.5% in 1988/89, 5.4% in 2016) (+1.9pp, p = 0.245) did not change. Increasingly more women with repeat adolescent births preferred to have had the second child later, 22.5% in 1995 and 43.1% in 2016 (+20.6pp, p = <0.001). On the 2016 survey, women from poorer households and those of younger age at first birth were significantly more likely to report repeat adolescent birth. Conclusion Following a first birth <18 years, more than half of the women report a repeat adolescent birth (<20 years), with no decline observed in 30 years. Increasingly more women wanted the second adolescent pregnancy later, highlighting the need to support adolescents with improved family planning services at each contact."
https://openalex.org/W3015964389,"Objective Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a chronic infectious disease with worldwide prevalence that causes hearing loss and decreased quality of life. As current (antibiotic) treatments often unsuccessful and antibiotic resistance is emerging, alternative agents and/or strategies are urgently needed. We considered the synthetic antimicrobial and anti-biofilm peptide P60.4Ac to be an interesting candidate because it also displays anti-inflammatory activities including lipopolysaccharide-neutralizing activity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of ototopical drops containing P60.4Ac in adults with CSOM without cholesteatoma. Methods We conducted a range-finding study in 16 subjects followed by a randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase IIa study in 34 subjects. P60.4Ac-containing ototopical drops or placebo drops were applied twice a day for 2 weeks and adverse events (AEs) and medication use were recorded. Laboratory tests, swabs from the middle ear and throat for bacterial cultures, and audiometry were performed at intervals up to 10 weeks after therapy. Response to treatment was assessed by blinded symptom scoring on otoscopy. Results Application of P60.4Ac-containing ototopical drops (0.25–2.0 mg of peptide/ml) in the ear canal of patients suffering from CSOM was found to be safe and well-tolerated. The optimal dose (0.5 mg of peptide/ml) was selected for the subsequent phase IIa study. Safety evaluation revealed only a few AEs that were unlikely related to study treatment and all, except one, were of mild to moderate intensity. In addition to this excellent safety profile, P60.4Ac ototopical drops resulted in a treatment success in 47% of cases versus 6% in the placebo group. Conclusion The efficacy/safety balance assessed in the present study provides a compelling justification for continued clinical development of P60.4Ac in therapy-resistant CSOM."

In order to develop evidence-based public health policies, surveillance of physical activity prevalence and trends is essential. The main aim of this study was to present updated data on physical activity trends in a Norwegian general population over the last decades. Data were collected from 40 690 individuals (50% men) aged ≥20 years participating in at least one of six surveys of the population-based Tromsø Study between 1979 and 2016. Age-standardized prevalences and trends in leisure-time and occupational physical activity were obtained from three questionnaires used in the different surveys. We observed an increase in the proportion engaging in exercise in leisure-time between 1994–95 and 2001 (p <0.001). Based on a different questionnaire, the age-standardized prevalence of engagement in exercise in leisure-time increased significantly from 16% in 2001 to 23% in 2007–08, and further to 28% in 2015–16 (p <0.001). The proportion who reported exercising approximately every day increased from 19% in 2007–08 to 28% in 2015–16 (p <0.001). The age-standardized prevalence of sedentary occupational activity increased from 53% in 2007–08 to 57% in 2015–16 (p <0.001), which extends the gradual increase from 36% in 1979-80.The present study extends previous findings from the Tromsø Study by demonstrating an increase in the proportion exercising regularly over the last three decades. This increase may partially counteract the gradual increase in the proportion with sedentary occupational activity."

Insecure attachment styles and inadequate parental care appear to play an important role in the onset and maintenance of both alexithymia and chronic pain. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the associations between attachment styles, parental bonding, and alexithymia among patients with FM and healthy controls (HC).All participants completed a battery of tests that assessed alexithymia, attachment styles, and parental bonding. Two logistic regression models were tested to examine whether these variables predict (a) group membership (i.e. patients with FM vs. HC) and (b) the likelihood of having alexithymia (i.e. among patients with FM and HC).Alexithymia (i.e. difficulty identifying and describing feelings subscales of the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale) significantly predicted group membership (i.e. the likelihood of having FM). On the other hand, educational level and dismissive attachment (i.e. the discomfort with closeness and relationships as secondary subscales of the Attachment Style Questionnaire) were the only significant predictors of the likelihood of having alexithymia.These findings highlight both the relevance of alexithymic traits to the definition of FM and centrality of an insecure attachment style to the manifestation of alexithymia."
https://openalex.org/W3015513113,"Large, old and heterogenous lake systems are valuable sources of biodiversity. The analysis of current spatial variability within such lakes increases our understanding of the origin and establishment of biodiversity. The environmental sensitivity and the high taxonomic richness of diatoms make them ideal organisms to investigate intra-lake variability. We investigated modern intra-lake diatom diversity in the large and old sub-arctic Lake Bolshoe Toko in Siberia. Our study uses diatom-specific metabarcoding, applying a short rbcL marker combined with next-generation sequencing and morphological identification to analyse the diatom diversity in modern sediment samples of 17 intra-lake sites. We analysed abundance-based compositional taxonomic diversity and generic phylogenetic diversity to investigate the relationship of diatom diversity changes with water depth. The two approaches show differences in taxonomic identification and alpha diversity, revealing a generally higher diversity with the genetic approach. With respect to beta diversity and ordination analyses, both approaches result in similar patterns. Water depth or related lake environmental conditions are significant factors influencing intra-lake diatom patterns, showing many significant negative correlations between alpha and beta diversity and water depth. Further, one near-shore and two lagoon lake sites characterized by low (0-10m) and medium (10-30m) water depth are unusual with unique taxonomic compositions. At deeper (>30m) water sites we identified strongest phylogenetic clustering in Aulacoseira, but generally much less in Staurosira, which supports that water depth is a strong environmental filter on the Aulacoseira communities. Our study demonstrates the utility of combining analyses of genetic and morphological as well as phylogenetic diversity to decipher compositional and generic phylogenetic patterns, which are relevant in understanding intra-lake heterogeneity as a source of biodiversity in the sub-arctic glacial Lake Bolshoe Toko."

The compounds were characterized via UV-Visible, NMR, IR spectroscopy and single crystal x-ray diffraction. Density Functional Theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT calculations in gas and solvent phases were carried out using B3LYP, B3P86, CAM-B3LYP and PBE0 hybrid functionals combined with LanL2DZ basis set. Complexation of L2F to form PdL2F was observed to cause a bathochromic shift of the maximum absorption bands of n-π* from 327 to 410 nm; an upfield shift for δ (HC = N) from 8.30 to 7.96 ppm and a decreased wavenumber for ν(C = N) from 1637 to 1616 cm-1. Overall, the UV-Vis, NMR and IR spectral data are relatively well reproduced through DFT and TD-DFT methods. L2F and PdL2F showed IC50 of 90.00 and 4.10 μg/mL, respectively, against human colorectal carcinoma (HCT116) cell lines, signifying increased anticancer activity upon complexation with Pd (II)."
https://openalex.org/W3016232718,"Identifying and preventing the occurrence of separation-related problems (SRP) in companion animals are relevant to animal welfare and the quality of human-pet interactions. The SRP are defined as a set of behaviors and physiological signs displayed by the animal when separated from its attachment person. In cats, SRP has been insufficiently studied. Thus, the objective of this study was to develop a questionnaire for cat owners which identifies behaviors that may indicate SRP, as well as relates the occurrence of SRP to the management practices applied in the sampled cats. The associations of SRP with cats’ characteristics, as well as owner, environmental, and management traits were investigated. The questionnaire was developed based on the scientific literature about separation anxiety syndrome in dogs and a few papers in cats, and it was completed by 130 owners of 223 cats. Analysis of owners’ answers was done through categorization and acquisition of relative frequencies of each response category, followed by Fisher’s exact test, chi-square tests in contingency table and Multiple Correspondence Analysis. Among the sampled animals, 13.45% (30 / 223) met at least one of the behavioral criteria we used to define SRP. Destructive behavior was the most frequently reported behavior (66.67%, 20 / 30), followed by excessive vocalization (63.33%, 19 / 30), urination in inappropriate places (60.00%, 18 / 30), depression-apathy (53.33%, 16 / 30), aggressiveness (36.67%, 11 / 30) and agitation-anxiety (36.67%, 11 / 30) and, in lower frequency, defecation in inappropriate places (23.33%, 7 / 30). The occurrence of SRP was associated with the number of females living in the residence (P = 0.01), with not having access to toys (P = 0.04), and no other animal residing in the house (P = 0.04). Separation-related problems in domestic cats are difficult to identify due to the limited amount of knowledge regarding the issue. The questionnaire developed in this study supported identification of the main behaviors likely related to SRP in cats and could be used as a starting point for future research."
https://openalex.org/W3015214667,"Extended Spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae are of major concern as they are implicated in multidrug resistant nosocomial infections. They are listed on a recently published global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by the World Health Organization which raises concern in both healthcare and community settings. This study aimed at determining the frequency of ESBL genes in multidrug resistant human clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Edo state Nigeria and to characterize the resistance mechanisms using whole genome sequencing. A total of 217 consecutive clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, selection based on inclusion criteria, were collected from March-May 2015 from three medical microbiology laboratories of hospitals in Edo state Nigeria. All isolates were analyzed using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by Kirby-Bauer method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination by E-test method. Double disc synergy test was used to screen for the production of ESBL. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for isolate characterization and identification of resistance determinants. Out of 217 consecutive clinical Enterobacteriaceae isolates, 148 (68.2%) were multi-drug resistant. Of these multi-drug resistant isolates, 60 (40.5%) were positive for the ESBL phenotypic test and carried ESBL genes. CTX-M-15 was the predominant ESBL found, among 93.3% (n = 56/60). Thirty-two plasmid incompatibility groups and 28 known and two new sequence types were identified among the ESBL isolates. The high occurrence of CTX-M-15 with associated resistant determinants in multidrug resistant Enterobacteriaceae harboring different plasmid incompatibility groups and sequence types calls for the need of continuous monitoring of this resistance threat to reduce its public health impact. To our knowledge, this study presents the first genomic characterization of ESBL production mediated by blaCTX-M-15 in human clinical isolates of Enterobacter hormaechei, Citrobacter werkmanii and Atlantibacter hermannii from Nigeria."

IBD patients have abnormal expression of elafin, a human elastase-specific protease inhibitor and antimicrobial peptide. We determined elafin expression in blood, intestine, and mesenteric fat of IBD and non-IBD patients.Serum samples from normal and IBD patients were collected from two UCLA cohorts. Surgical resection samples of human colonic and mesenteric fat tissues from IBD and non-IBD (colon cancer) patients were collected from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.High serum elafin levels were associated with a significantly elevated risk of intestinal stricture in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Microsoft Azure Machine learning algorithm using serum elafin levels and clinical data identified stricturing CD patients with high accuracy. Serum elafin levels had weak positive correlations with clinical disease activity (Partial Mayo Score and Harvey Bradshaw Index), but not endoscopic disease activity (Mayo Endoscopic Subscore and Simple Endoscopic Index for CD) in IBD patients. Ulcerative colitis (UC) patients had high serum elafin levels. Colonic elafin mRNA and protein expression were not associated with clinical disease activity and histological injury in IBD patients, but stricturing CD patients had lower colonic elafin expression than non-stricturing CD patients. Mesenteric fat in stricturing CD patients had significantly increased elafin mRNA and protein expression, which may contribute to high circulating elafin levels. Human mesenteric fat adipocytes secrete elafin protein.High circulating elafin levels are associated with the presence of stricture in CD patients. Serum elafin levels may help identify intestinal strictures in CD patients."
https://openalex.org/W3015426200,"The intracellular molecular pathways involved in radiation-induced nephropathy are still poorly understood. Glomerular endothelial cells are key components of the structure and function of the glomerular filtration barrier but little is known about the mechanisms implicated in their injury and repair. The current study establishes the response of immortalized human glomerular endothelial cells (GEnC) to ionizing radiation (IR). We investigated the role of sphingolipids and the lipid-modifying enzyme sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase acid-like 3b (SMPDL3b) in radiation-induced GEnC damage. After delivering a single dose of radiation, long and very-long-chain ceramide species, and the expression levels of SMPDL3b were elevated. In contrast, levels of ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) dropped in a time-dependent manner although mRNA and protein levels of ceramide kinase (CERK) remained stable. Treatment with C1P or knocking down SMPDL3b partially restored cell survival and conferred radioprotection. We also report a novel role for the NADPH oxidase enzymes (NOXs), namely NOX1, and NOX-derived reactive oxygen species (ROS) in radiation-induced GEnC damage. Subjecting cultured endothelial cells to radiation was associated with increased NOX activity and superoxide anion generation. Silencing NOX1 using NOX1-specific siRNA mitigated radiation-induced oxidative stress and cellular injury. In addition, we report a novel connection between NOX and SMPDL3b. Treatment with the NOX inhibitor, GKT, decreased radiation-induced cellular injury and restored SMPDL3b basal levels of expression. Our findings indicate the importance of SMPDL3b as a potential therapeutic target in radiation-induced kidney damage."

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the effect of U pinnatifida extracts on exercise endurance and skeletal muscle mass. C57BL/6 mice were fed a 0.25% U pinnatifida extract-containing diet for 8 weeks. U pinnatifida extract-fed mice showed increased running distance, total running time, and extensor digitorum longus and gastrocnemius muscle weights. U pinnatifida extract supplementation upregulated the expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2C, oxidative muscle fiber markers such as myosin heavy chain 1 (MHC1), and oxidative biomarkers in the gastrocnemius muscles. Compared to the controls, U pinnatifida extract-fed mice showed larger mitochondria and increased gene and protein expression of molecules involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation, including nuclear respiratory factor 2 and mitochondrial transcription factor A. U pinnatifida extract supplementation also increased the mRNA expression of angiogenesis markers, including VEGFa, VEGFb, FGF1, angiopoietin 1, and angiopoietin 2, in the gastrocnemius muscles. Importantly, U pinnatifida extracts upregulated the estrogen-related receptor γ and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma co-activator 1-alpha (PGC-1α)/AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) networks, which are partially increased by fucoxanthin, hesperetin, and caffeic acid treatments. Collectively, U pinnatifida extracts enhance mitochondrial biogenesis, increase oxidative muscle fiber, and promote angiogenesis in skeletal muscles, resulting in improved exercise capacity and skeletal muscle mass. These effects are attributable to fucoxanthin, hesperetin, and caffeic acid, bioactive components of U pinnatifida extracts."

https://openalex.org/W3015582959,"Liver inflammation is a common extraintestinal manifestation in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet, the mechanisms driving gut-liver axis inflammation remain poorly understood. IBD leads to a breakdown in the integrity of the intestinal barrier causing an increase in portal and systemic gut-derived antigens, which challenge the liver. Here, we examined the role of platelet activating factor receptor (PAFR) in colitis-associated liver damage using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) and anti-CD40-induced colitis models. Both DSS and anti-CD40 models exhibited liver inflammation associated with colitis. Colitis reduced global PAFR protein expression in mouse livers causing an exclusive re-localization of PAFR to the portal triad. The global decrease in liver PAFR was associated with increased sirtuin 1 while relocalized PAFR expression was limited to Kupffer cells (KCs) and co-localized with toll-like receptor 4. DSS activated the NLRP3-inflammasome and increased interleukin (IL)-1β in the liver. Antagonism of PAFR amplified the inflammasome response by increasing NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1β protein levels in the liver. LPS also increased NLRP3 response in human hepatocytes, however, overexpression of PAFR restored the levels of NLPR3 and caspase-1 proteins. Interestingly, KCs depletion also increased IL-1β protein in mouse liver after DSS challenge. These data suggest a protective role for PAFR-expressing KCs during colitis and that regulation of PAFR is important for gut-liver axis homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W3015839921,"While urine has been considered as a useful bio-fluid for health monitoring, its dynamic changes to physical activity are not well understood. We examined urine's possible antitumor capability in response to medium-level, loading-driven physical activity. Urine was collected from mice subjected to 5-minute skeletal loading and human individuals before and after 30-minute step aerobics. Six cancer cell lines (breast, prostate, and pancreas) and a mouse model of the mammary tumor were employed to evaluate the effect of urine. Compared to urine collected prior to loading, urine collected post-activity decreased the cellular viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of tumor cells, as well as tumor weight in the mammary fat pad. Detection of urinary volatile organic compounds and ELISA assays showed that the loading-conditioned urine reduced cholesterol and elevated dopamine and melatonin. Immunohistochemical fluorescent images presented upregulation of the rate-limiting enzymes for the production of dopamine and melatonin in the brain. Molecular analysis revealed that the antitumor effect was linked to the reduction in molecular vinculin-linked molecular force as well as the downregulation of the Lrp5-CSF1-CD105 regulatory axis. Notably, the survival rate for the high expression levels of Lrp5, CSF1, and CD105 in tumor tissues was significantly lowered in the Cancer Genome Atlas database. Collectively, this study revealed that 5- or 10-minute loading-driven physical activity was sufficient to induce the striking antitumor effect by activating the neuronal signaling and repressing cholesterol synthesis. The result supported the dual role of loading-conditioned urine as a potential tumor suppressor and a source of diagnostic biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W3015363404,"miRNAs regulate post-transcriptional gene expression in metazoans, and thus are involved in many fundamental cellular biological processes. Extracellular miRNAs are also found in most human biofluids including plasma. These circulating miRNAs constitute a long distance inter cellular communication system and are potentially useful biomarkers. High throughput technologies like microarrays are able to scan a complete miRNome providing useful detection scores that are underexplored. We proposed to answer how many and which miRNAs are detectable in plasma or extracellular vesicles as these questions have not yet been answered. We set out to address this knowledge gap by analyzing the mirRNome in plasma and corresponding extracellular vesicles (EVs) from 12 children affected by retinoblastoma (Rb) a childhood intraocular malignant tumor, as well as from 12 healthy similarly aged controls. We calculated an average of 537 detectable miRNAs in plasma and 625 in EVs. The most miRNA enriched compartment were EVs from Rb cases with an average of 656 detectable elements. Using hierarchical clustering with the detection scores, we generated broad detection mirnome maps and identified a plasma signature of 19 miRNAs present in all Rb cases that is able to discriminate cases from controls. An additional 9 miRNAs were detected in all the samples; within this group, miRNA-5787 and miRNA-6732-5p were highly abundant and displayed very low variance across all the samples, suggesting both are good candidates to serve as plasma references or normalizers. Further exploration considering participant’s sex, allowed discovering 5 miRNAs which corresponded only to females and 4 miRNAs corresponding only to males. Target and pathway analysis of these miRNAs revealed hormonal function including estrogen, thyroid signaling pathways and testosterone biosynthesis. This approach allows a comprehensive unbiased survey of a circulating miRNome landscape, creating the possibility to define normality in mirnomic profiles, and to locate where in these miRNome profiles promising and potentially useful circulating miRNA signatures can be found."
https://openalex.org/W3015585826,"Acute renal depletion of sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) in mice results in blunted natriuretic response and hypertension due to impaired dopamine D5 receptor (D5 R) activity. We elucidated the molecular mechanisms for these phenotypes in Snx1-/- mice. These mice had increased renal expressions of angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1 R), NADPH oxidase (NOX) subunits, D5 R, and NaCl cotransporter. Basal reactive oxygen species (ROS), NOX activity, and blood pressure (BP) were also higher in Snx1-/- mice, which were normalized by apocynin, a drug that prevents NOX assembly. Renal proximal tubule (RPT) cells from hypertensive (HT) Euro-American males had deficient SNX1 activity, impaired D5 R endocytosis, and increased ROS compared with cells from normotensive (NT) Euro-American males. siRNA-mediated depletion of SNX1 in RPT cells from NT subjects led to a blunting of D5 R agonist-induced increase in cAMP production and decrease in Na+ transport, effects that were normalized by over-expression of SNX1. Among HT African-Americans, three of the 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms interrogated for the SNX1 gene were associated with a decrease in systolic BP in response to hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ). The results illustrate a new paradigm for the development of hypertension and imply that the trafficking protein SNX1 may be a crucial determinant for hypertension and response to antihypertensive therapy."
https://openalex.org/W3015514250,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are persistent organic pollutants that are released into soils primarily from the air, with wet and dry deposition. To assess the contamination of the forest soil environment, soil samples were collected from organic and mineral horizons from three study areas representing a gradient of pollution across Poland (the ‘pollution transect’). The soils examined varied in PAH contents, generally from 124.3 μg·kg-1 dw in the areas deemed to be the background zone to 9165.5 μk·kg-1 dw in industrial areas in the O horizon and from 12.6 μk·kg-1 dw to 4454.6 μk·kg-1 dw in the A horizon. The PAH toxicities oscillated from 20.0–2670.8 μg TEQ·kg-1 dw in the O horizon and from 1.73–694.7 μg TEQ·kg-1 dw in the A horizon. The enrichment factor values point to a more intensive accumulation of PAHs with relatively high molecular weights along the pollution transect. The PAH diagnostic ratio values indicated that the main PAH emission sources were from coal and wood combustion."
https://openalex.org/W3016166247,"Herein, we present coastal-wave records under historically extreme conditions caused by a strong typhoon in Japan in 2017. The extreme typhoon generated large infragravity waves, reaching a height of 2 m in shallow water. We took advantage of the extraordinary conditions to analyze the effect of the energetic infragravity waves on the nearshore evolution of relatively short waves. Individual wave analyses clearly demonstrate that the instantaneous water-level rise and drawdown caused by the infragravity waves alternately decelerated and accelerated the breaking of short waves under extreme conditions. This mechanism transmitted the large short-wave energy on the infragravity wave crests to the shore, eventually increasing the height of the nearshore waves. This study provides in situ evidence that the infragravity waves significantly affect nearshore wave characteristics under extreme conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3015250488,"Background Many genomic analyses of cortisol-producing adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) have been reported, but very few have come from East Asia. The first objective of this study is to verify the genetic difference with the previous reports by analyzing targeted deep sequencing of 7 Japanese ACC cases using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The second objective is to compare the somatic variant findings identified by NGS analysis with clinical and pathological findings, aiming to acquire new knowledge about the factors that contribute to the poor prognosis of ACC and to find new targets for the treatment of ACC. Method DNA was extracted from ACC tissue of seven patients and two reference blood samples. Targeted deep sequencing was performed using the MiSeq system for 12 genes, and the obtained results were analyzed using MuTect2. The hypothesis was obtained by integrating the somatic variant findings with clinical and pathological data, and it was further verified using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset for ACC. Results Six possible pathogenic and one uncertain significance somatic variants including a novel PRKAR1A (NM_002734.4):c.545C>A (p.T182K) variant were found in five of seven cases. By integrating these data with pathological findings, we hypothesized that cases with TP53 variants were more likely to show atypical mitotic figures. Using TCGA dataset, we found that atypical mitotic figures were associated with TP53 somatic variant, and mRNA expression of CCNB2 and AURKA was significantly high in TP53 mutated cases and atypical mitotic figure cases. Conclusion We believe this is the first report that discusses the relationship between atypical mitotic figures and TP53 somatic variant in ACC. We presumed that overexpression of CCNB2 and AURKA mRNA may cause atypical mitosis in TP53 somatic mutated cases. Because AURKA is highly expressed in atypical mitotic cases, it may be an appropriate indicator for AURKA inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3015587563,"The ability to predict when an individual will die can be extremely useful for many research problems in aging. A technique for predicting death in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, has been proposed which relies on an increase in the permeability of the fly intestinal system, allowing dyes from the diet to permeate the body of the fly shortly before death. In this study we sought to verify this claim in a large cohort study using different populations of D. melanogaster and different dyes. We found that only about 50% of the individuals showed a visible distribution of dye before death. This number did not vary substantially with the dye used. Most flies that did turn a blue color before death did so within 24 hours of death. There was also a measurable effect of the dye on the fly mean longevity. These results would tend to limit the utility of this method depending on the application the method was intended for."
https://openalex.org/W3015708311,"Urban traffic is an important source of global CO2 emissions. Uncovering the temporal and structural characteristics can provide scientific support to identify the variation regulation and main subjects of urban traffic CO2 emissions. The road class is one of the most important factors influencing the urban traffic CO2 emissions. Based on the annual traffic field monitoring work in 2014 and the localized MOVES model, this study unravels the temporal variation and structural characteristics of the urban traffic CO2 emissions and conducts a comparative analysis of expressway (5R) and arterial road (DB), two typical classes of urban roads in Beijing. Obvious differences exist in the temporal variation characteristics of the traffic CO2 emissions between the expressway and arterial road at the annual, week and daily scales. The annual traffic CO2 emissions at the expressway (5R, with 47271.15 t) are more than ten times than those of the arterial road (DB, with 4139.19 t). Stronger weekly “rest effect” is observed at the expressway than the arterial road. The daily peak time and duration of the traffic CO2 emissions between the two classes of urban roads show significant differences particular in the evening peak. The differences of the structural characteristics between the two classes of urban roads are mainly reflected on the contribution of the public and freight transportation. Passenger vehicles play a predominant role at both the two classes of urban roads. The public transportation contributed more at DB (24.76%) than 5R (5.47%), and the freight transportation contributed more at 5R (23.41%) than DB (3.49%). The results suggest that the influence of traffic CO2 emissions on the CO2 flux is significant at the residential and commercial mixed underlying urban areas with arterial roads (DB) but not significant at the underlying urban park area with expressway (5R) in this study. The vegetation cover in urban areas have effects on the CO2 reduction. Increasing the design and construction of the green space along the urban roads with busy traffic flow will be an effective way to mitigate the urban traffic CO2 emissions and build the low-carbon cities."
https://openalex.org/W3015726599,"Background Clinical application of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) usually requires an in vitro expansion step to reach clinically relevant numbers. In vitro cell expansion necessitates supplementation of basal mammalian cell culture medium with growth factors. To avoid using supplements containing animal substances, human platelet lysates (hPL) produced from expired and pathogen inactivated platelet concentrates can be used in place of fetal bovine serum. However, globally, most transfusion units are currently not pathogen inactivated. As blood banks are the sole source of platelet concentrates for hPL production, it is important to ensure product safety and standardized production methods. In this proof-of-concept study we assessed the feasibility of producing hPL from expired platelet concentrates with pathogen inactivation applied after platelet lysis by evaluating the retention of growth factors, cytokines, and the ability to support MSC proliferation and tri-lineage differentiation. Methodology/Principal findings Bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) were expanded and differentiated using hPL derived from pathogen inactivated platelet lysates (hPL-PIPL), with pathogen inactivation by amotosalen/ultraviolet A treatment applied after lysis of expired platelets. Results were compared to those using hPL produced from conventional expired pathogen inactivated platelet concentrates (hPL-PIPC), with pathogen inactivation applied after blood donation. hPL-PIPL treatment had lower concentrations of soluble growth factors and cytokines than hPL-PIPC treatment. When used as supplementation in cell culture, BM-MSCs proliferated at a reduced rate, but more consistently, in hPL-PIPL than in hPL-PIPC. The ability to support tri-lineage differentiation was comparable between lysates. Conclusion/Significance These results suggest that functional hPL can be produced from expired and untreated platelet lysates by applying pathogen inactivation after platelet lysis. When carried out post-expiration, pathogen inactivation may provide a valuable solution for further standardizing global hPL production methods, increasing the pool of starting material, and meeting future demand for animal-free supplements in human cell culturing."

Here, we investigated affective state, which are emotion-like processes influenced by positive or negative experiences, in a territorial fish following aggressive encounters and explore links to bold/shy behavioural traits. Eighteen 15-month old Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii) received three tests in order to determine bold/shy behavioural traits then underwent a typical go/no-go judgement bias (JB) test. The JB apparatus had five adjacent chambers with access provided by a sliding door and fish underwent a training procedure to enter a chamber at one end of the apparatus to receive a food reward but were chased using a net if they entered the chamber at the opposite end. Only one third (N = 6) of fish successfully completed the training procedure (trained fish), and the remaining 12 fish failed to reach the learning criterion (untrained fish). Trained fish housed with a larger aggressive Murray cod for 24 h were significantly less likely to enter intermediate chambers during probe tests compared to control fish, demonstrating a pessimistic response. Trained fish showed “bolder” responses in emergence and conspecific inspection tests than untrained fish, suggesting that shyer individuals were less able to apply a learned behaviour in a novel environment. Our limited sample was biased towards bold individuals but supports the hypothesis that losing an aggressive encounter leads to pessimistic decision-making."

This study sought to characterize the humoral immune response to anthrax toxin components, capsule and spore antigens in individuals (n = 46) from the Kayseri and Malatya regions of Turkey who had recovered from mild or severe forms of cutaneous anthrax infection, compared to regional healthy controls (n = 20). IgG antibodies to each toxin component, the poly-γ-D-glutamic acid capsule, the Bacillus collagen-like protein of anthracis (BclA) spore antigen, and the spore carbohydrate anthrose, were detected in the cases, with anthrax toxin neutralization and responses to Protective Antigen (PA) and Lethal Factor (LF) being higher following severe forms of the disease. Significant correlative relationships among responses to PA, LF, Edema Factor (EF) and capsule were observed among the cases. Though some regional control sera exhibited binding to a subset of the tested antigens, these samples did not neutralize anthrax toxins and lacked correlative relationships among antigen binding specificities observed in the cases. Comparison of serum binding to overlapping decapeptides covering the entire length of PA, LF and EF proteins in 26 cases compared to 8 regional controls revealed that anthrax toxin-neutralizing antibody responses elicited following natural cutaneous anthrax infection are directed to conformational epitopes. These studies support the concept of vaccination approaches that preserve conformational epitopes."
https://openalex.org/W3015684290,"Many studies have examined children’s understanding of playing and learning as separate concepts, but the ways that children relate playing and learning to one another remain relatively unexplored. The current study asked 5- to 8-year-olds (N = 92) to define playing and learning, and examined whether children defined them as abstract processes or merely as labels for particular types of activities. We also asked children to state whether playing and learning can occur simultaneously, and examined whether they could give examples of playing and learning with attributes either congruent or incongruent with those activities. Older children were more likely to define both playing and learning in terms of abstract processes, rather than by describing particular topics or activities. Children who defined both playing and learning in this way were able to generate more examples of situations where they were simultaneously playing and learning, and were better able to generate examples of learning with characteristics of play, and examples of playing with characteristics of learning. These data suggest that children develop an understanding that learning and playing can coincide. These results are critical to researchers and educators who seek to integrate play and learning, as children’s beliefs about these concepts can influence how they reflect on playful learning opportunities."

However, there has been a lack of a JE epidemic systematic analysis, which is urgently needed to guide control and prevention efforts.This study explored and described the spatiotemporal distribution of JE cases observed among two different age groups in Yunnan Province from 2007 to 2017. The epidemiological features and spatial features were analyzed according to basic statistics, ArcGIS software (version 9.3; ESRI, Redlands, CA) and SPSS software (version 20; IBM Corp., Armonk, New York).Overall, the whole province had a high incidence of JE. The annual incidence rates in 2007 and 2017 were 1.668/100,000 and 0.158/100,000, respectively. The annual mortality was under 0.095/100,000 for these years. Although the whole province was in danger of JE, the Diqing autonomous prefecture and the Lijiang autonomous prefecture had no JE cases recorded for over 10 years. The JE cases were reported by hospitals located in 60 counties of 14 municipalities. The top ten areas with the most JE cases were Kunming City, Zhaotong City, Jinghong City, Wenshan City, Mangshi City, Pu'er City, Baoshan City, Dali City, Chuxiong City, and Gejiu City. The incidence declined smoothly, with a peak occurring from June to September, which accounted for 96.1% of the total cases. Children whose age was equal or less than 10 years old (LEQ10) still maintained a high frequency of JEV infection, and a large number of cases were reported in August, despite the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), which was established in April 2008. There was no difference in the quantity of cases between the two groups (t = -0.411, P>0.05); additionally, the number of JE cases among patients LEQ10 were significantly greater than those among patients older than 10 years (GTR10). Further analysis using local indicators of spatial association (LISA) revealed that the distribution of JE exhibited a high-high cluster characteristic (Z = 2.06, P<0.05), which showed that Jinghong City, Guangnan County, Yanshan County, Funing County, and Mengzi City were hot spots for the JE epidemic.Although the EPI was established in 2008 and the incidence of JE declined smoothly in Yunnan Province, there was no difference in the number of cases between the two age groups, which reveals that the EPI has been conducted with a low level success. In the context of limited vaccine supply capacity, we should strengthen the implementation of the children's immunization program before strengthening other immunization programs."

We find that average contributions are positively affected by the anchor. The anchor is also found to influence the behavioural strategy that individuals adopt, such that low anchors significantly increase the likelihood that players will adopt unconditional self-interested strategies, whereas high anchors increase the likelihood of adopting giving strategies. The distribution of strategies–and hence, the distribution of behavioural ‘types’—is therefore affected by the initial conditions of play, lending support to the notion that behavioural strategies are context dependent."

Effects of a moderately elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) on lung mechanics are still not fully analyzed. Moreover, the optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in elevated IAP is unclear.We investigated changes in lung mechanics and transformation in histological lung patterns using three different PEEP levels in eighteen deeply anesthetized pigs with an IAP of 10 mmHg. After establishing the intra-abdominal pressure, we randomized the animals into 3 groups. Each of n = 6 (Group A = PEEP 5, B = PEEP 10 and C = PEEP 15 cmH2O). End-expiratory lung volume (EELV/kg body weight (bw)), pulmonary compliance (Cstat), driving pressure (ΔP) and transpulmonary pressure (ΔPL) were measured for 6 hours. Additionally, the histological lung injury score was calculated.Comparing hours 0 and 6 in group A, there was a decrease of EELV/kg (27±2 vs. 16±1 ml/kg; p<0.05) and of Cstat (42±2 vs. 27±1 ml/cmH2O; p<0.05) and an increase of ΔP (11±0 vs. 17±1 cmH2O; p<0.05) and ΔPL (6±0 vs. 10±1 cmH2O; p<0.05). In group B, there was no significant change in EELV/kg (27±3 vs. 24±3 ml/kg), but a decrease in Cstat (42±3 vs. 32±1 ml/cmH20; p<0.05) and an increase in ΔP (11±1 vs. 15±1 cmH2O; p<0.05) and ΔPL (5±1 vs. 7±0 cmH2O; p<0.05).

Histological lung injury score was lowest in group B.A moderate elevated IAP of 10 mmHg leads to relevant changes in lung mechanics during mechanical ventilation. In our study, a PEEP of 10 cmH2O was associated with a lower lung injury score and was able to overcome the IAP induced alterations of EELV."

In the present investigation, we analyzed and compared the process of innovation for six genomic technologies: viral vectors, RNAi, TALENs, meganucleases, ZFNs and CRISPR/Cas including the profile of the main research institutions and their funders, to understand how innovation evolved and what institutions influenced research trajectories. A Web of Science search of papers on viral vectors RNAi, CRISPR/Cas, TALENs, ZFNs and meganucleases was used to build a citation network of 16,746 papers. An analysis of network clustering combined with text mining was performed. For viral vectors, a long-term process of incremental innovation was identified, which was largely publicly funded in the United States and the European Union. The trajectory of RNAi research included clusters related to the study of RNAi as a biological phenomenon and its use in functional genomics, biomedicine and pest control. A British philanthropic organization and a US pharmaceutical company played a key role in the development of basic RNAi research and clinical application respectively, in addition to government and academic institutions. In the case of CRISPR/Cas research, basic science discoveries led to the technical improvements, and these two in turn provided the information required for the development of biomedical, agricultural, livestock and industrial applications. The trajectory of CRISPR/Cas research exhibits a geopolitical division of the investigation efforts between the US, as the main producer and funder of basic research and technical improvements, and Chinese research institutions increasingly leading applied research. Our results reflect a change in the model for financing science, with reduced public financing for basic science and applied research on publicly funded technological developments in the US, and the emergence of China as a scientific superpower, with implications for the development of applications of genomic technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3015434461,"Objectives Poor discharge communication is associated with negative health outcomes in high-income countries. However, quality of discharge communication has received little attention in India and many other low and middle-income countries. Primary objective To investigate verbal and documented discharge communication for chronic non-communicable disease (NCD) patients. Secondary objective To explore the relationship between quality of discharge communication and health outcomes. Methods Design Prospective study. Setting Three public hospitals in Himachal Pradesh and Kerala states, India. Participants 546 chronic NCD (chronic respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease or diabetes) patients. Piloted questionnaires were completed at admission, discharge and five and eighteen-week follow-up covering health status, discharge communication practices and health-seeking behaviour. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between quality of discharge communication and health outcomes. Outcome measures Primary Patient recall and experiences of verbal and documented discharge communication. Secondary Death, hospital readmission and self-reported deterioration of NCD/s. Results All patients received discharge notes, predominantly on sheets of paper with basic pre-printed headings (71%) or no structure (19%); 31% of notes contained all the following information required for facilitating continuity of care: diagnosis, medication information, lifestyle advice, and follow-up instructions. Patient reports indicated notable variations in verbal information provided during discharge consultations; 50% received ongoing treatment/management information and 23% received lifestyle advice. Within 18 weeks of follow-up, 25 (5%) patients had died, 69 (13%) had been readmitted and 62 (11%) reported that their chronic NCD/s had deteriorated. Significant associations were found between low-quality documented discharge communication and death (AOR = 3.00; 95% CI 1.27,7.06) and low-quality verbal discharge communication and self-reported deterioration of chronic NCD/s (AOR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.25,0.83) within 18-weeks of follow-up. Conclusions Sub-optimal discharge practices may be compromising continuity and safety of chronic NCD patient care. Structured protocols, documents and training are required to improve discharge communication, healthcare integration and NCD management."

However, the residual effect of insecticide mists applied to outdoor resting habitats of mosquitoes is not well characterized. The objective of this study was to assess the longevity of the residual insecticidal effect of three pyrethroid formulations applied to outdoor vegetation against the Southeast Asian malaria vector Anopheles dirus. Lambda-cyhalothrin capsule suspension, deltamethrin emulsifiable concentrate and bifenthrin wettable powder were sprayed on dense bamboo bushes on the Thailand-Myanmar border during the dry season 2018. The duration and magnitude of the residual insecticidal effect were assessed weekly with a standard cone assay, using freshly collected insecticide-treated bamboo leaves and a laboratory-adapted colony of Anopheles dirus sensu stricto susceptible to pyrethroids. The experiment was repeated during the rainy season to assess the persistence of the lambda-cyhalothrin formulation after natural rains and artificial washings. During the dry season (cumulative rainfall = 28 mm in 111 days), mortality and knockdown (KD) rates were >80% for 60 days with bifenthrin and 90 days with lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin. The 50% knockdown time (TKD50) was <15 min with lambda-cyhalothrin and deltamethrin, and <30 min with bifenthrin. During the rainy season (cumulative rainfall = 465 mm in 51 days), mortality and KD rates were >80% for 42 days and TKD50 was <15 min with lambda-cyhalothrin. Additional artificial washing of the testing material with 10L of tap water before performing the cone tests had no significant effect on the residual insecticidal effect of this formulation. Long-lasting residual insecticidal effect can be obtained when spraying pyrethroid insecticides on the outdoor resting habitats of malaria vectors."
https://openalex.org/W3015995712,"This paper presents a conceptual wind vector detector for measuring the velocity and direction of wind in enclosed or semi-enclosed large spaces. Firstly, a thermal wind sensor with constant power control was manufactured and then used as a wind velocity sensing unit. Secondly, a sensor bracket equipped with three thermal wind sensors was designed, the fluid dynamic response regularity of the measured wind field to the sensor bracket was analyzed using ANSYS Fluent CFD software, and then its structural parameters were optimized to improve measurement accuracy. The sensor bracket was fabricated via 3D printing. Finally, a unique wind vector measurement method was developed for the wind vector detector. Experimental results showed that the measured velocity range of the thermal wind sensor satisfied the requirements of being within 0-15 m/s with an accuracy of ±0.3 m/s, and the wind direction angle range of the wind vector detector was within 0-360° with an accuracy of ±5°. By changing the applied power control value of the thermal wind sensor and structural parameters of the sensor bracket, the measurement range and accuracy of the wind vector detector can be adjusted to suit different applications."
https://openalex.org/W3015346193,"There is a molecular basis for many sleep patterns and disorders involving circadian clock genes. In humans, ""short-sleeper"" behavior has been linked to specific amino acid substitutions in BHLHE41 (DEC2), yet little is known about variation at these sites and across this gene in mammals. We compare BHLHE41 coding sequences for 27 mammals. Approximately half of the coding sequence was invariable at the nucleotide level and close to three-quarters of the amino acid alignment was identical. No other mammals had the same ""short-sleeper"" amino acid substitutions previously described from humans. Phylogenetic analyses based on the nucleotides of the coding sequence alignment are consistent with established mammalian relationships confirming orthology among the sampled sequences. Significant purifying selection was detected in about two-thirds of the variable codons and no codons exhibited significant signs of positive selection. Unexpectedly, the gorilla BHLHE41 sequence has a 318 bp insertion at the 5' end of the coding sequence and a deletion of 195 bp near the 3' end of the coding sequence (including the two short sleeper variable sites). Given the strong signal of purifying selection across this gene, phylogenetic congruence with expected relationships and generally conserved function among mammals investigated thus far, we suggest the indels predicted in the gorilla BHLHE41 may represent an annotation error and warrant experimental validation."
