https://openalex.org/W2073066596,"Measurements of the lead isotopic composition and the uranium, thorium, and lead concentrations in meteorites were made in order to obtain more precise radiometric ages of these members of the solar system. The newly determined value of the lead isotopic composition of Canyon Diablo troilite is as follows: (206)Pb/(204)Pb = 9.307, (207)Pb/(2O4)Pb = 10.294, and (208)Pb/(204)Pb = 29.476. The leads of Angra dos Reis, Sioux County, and Nuevo Laredo achondrites are very radiogenic, the (206)Pb/(204)Pb values are about 200, and the uranium-thorium-lead systems are nearly concordant. The ages of the meteorites as calculated from a single-stage (207)Pb/(206)Pb isochron based on the newly determined primordial lead value and the newly reported (235)U and (838)U decay constants, are 4.528 x 10(9) years for Sioux County and Nuevo Laredo and 4.555 x 10(9) years for Angra dos Reis. When calculated with the uranium decay constants used by Patterson, these ages are 4.593 x 10(9) years and 4.620 x 10(9) years, respectively, and are therefore 40 to 70 x 10(6) years older than the 4.55 x 10(9) years age Patterson reported. The age difference of 27 x 10(6) years between Angra dos Reis and the other two meteorites is compatible with the difference between the initial (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratio of Angra dos Reis and that of seven basaltic achondrites observed by Papanastassiou and Wasserburg. The time difference is also comparable to that determined by (129)1-(129)Xe chronology. The ages of ordinary chondrites (H5 and L6) range from 4.52 to 4.57 x 10(9) years, and, here too, time differences in the formation of the parent bodies or later metamorphic events are indicated. Carbonaceous chondrites(C2 and C3) appear to contain younger lead components."
https://openalex.org/W1989496530,"The discovery of an alloy of aluminum and manganese with sharp Bragg diffraction spots and an icosahedral point group symmetry was announced last year. The icosahedral symmetry appears to be an intrinsic property of the material and not an artifact of twinning. There are remarkable similarities between the observed diffraction patterns and aperiodic tesselations of space called Penrose tiles. The relation between the experiments and Penrose tiles, as well as phenomenological descriptions of the icosahedral aluminum-manganese alloy as a superposition of incommensurate density waves, are reviewed. Other types of exotic crystallography are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1972912199,"Quartz particles in sediments become flatter with decreasing size; a cleavage mechanism may operate below the critical size of about 100 microns. Flat particles would tend to form a more open packing than spherical particles, and this may contribute to the collapse of loess and similar soils and the sudden loss of strength observed in ""sensitive"" clay soils."
https://openalex.org/W2010214672,"Well-preserved Lower Cretaceous fossil copepods related to the super-family Dichelesthioidea have been collected from the gill chamber of the ichthyodectid fish Cladocyclus gardneri. The fossils provide conclusive evidence suporting recent theories that link caligid copepods, which are parasitic on fish, to the invertebrate-associated siphonostomes. This is the first discovery of fossil parasitic copepods, and they are by far the oldest copepods of any sort known."
https://openalex.org/W2051984990,"Of 37 genera and well-defined subgenera identified in the amber of the Dominican Republic (late Oligocene or early Miocene), 34 have survived somewhere in the New World tropics to the present, although the species studied thus far are extinct. Of the surviving genera and subgenera, 22 persist on Hispaniola. Fifteen genera and subgenera have colonized the island since amber times, restoring the number of genera and well-defined subgenera now present on Hispaniola to 37. A higher extinction rate has occurred in genera and subgenera that are either highly specialized or possess less colonizing ability, as evidenced by their restriction to the New World."
https://openalex.org/W2077434158,"At the transitions from the low-temperature orthorhombic forms of lutetium fluoride and yttrium fluoride to the high-temperature hexagonal forms, there are increases of several orders of magnitude in the ionic conductivities. In the high-temperature phases the conductivities are comparable to those of typical ionic melts. These fluoride compounds are therefore solid electrolytes."
https://openalex.org/W2065950017,"The light-scattering and light-absorption coefficients of the global background aerosol define its single-scatter albedo. Continuous, simultaneous measurements of these optical coefficients were made on a daily basis for the remote marine mid-troposphere; such measurements are essential for assessment of the effects of aerosol on atmospheric radiative transfer. Measurements of light-absorption coefficients made at the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii were higher than expected, and the single-scatter albedo was lower than the value often used in radiative transfer models. Soot appears to be the most likely primary absorber, and hemispheric dispersal of this combustion-derived material is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2030876584,Problematic trace fossils collected from the Middle Silurian Thorold Sandstone bear a striking resemblance to feeding traces made by the proboscises of modern echiuroid worms. Paleoecological approximations of depth and salinity may be possible depending on population densities. Echiuroids may have been a significant element of the Paleozoic benthos.
https://openalex.org/W2021237976,The condensed water content of convective storms was measured by the use of a penetrating aircraft. Regions 1 to 2 kilometers in extent and having condensed water contents of about 20 grams per cubic meter were found to be definite features of the cloud interior.
https://openalex.org/W2015697994,"A study of the sizes of so-called polonium radiohalos of various types found in biotite from Bancroft, Ontario, has been carried out. The evidence is consistent with the interpretation that these halos are variants of the standard uranium halos. A review of the literature indicates that there is no firm evidence that polonium halos exist, all evidence being equally consistent with the interpretation that these are uranium halos."

https://openalex.org/W1984859743,"Examples are presented that suggest that the United States is about to run out of electricity. This is not going to happen in the next few years, but beyond that nobody knows. Forecasting electricity demand has become a highly uncertain business. Twenty years ago making a decision to add generating or transmission capacity would have been fairly straightforward. Today the problem is immensely more complicated. Uncertainty about national and regional economic growth, conservation, and small power generation have caused many power companies to shelve building plans. Wary that investor confidence in electric utilities has been eroded by massive cost overruns and falling growth, power companies are understandably adopting a low-risk, least-cost strategy for meeting power demand. The problems faced by the electric utilities in planning for additional capacity on their systems are discussed."
