https://openalex.org/W2081281959,The initial behavioral reaction to unfamiliar events is a distinctive source of intraspecific variation in humans and other animals. Two longitudinal studies of 2-year-old children who were extreme in the display of either behavioral restraint or spontaneity in unfamiliar contexts revealed that by 7 years of age a majority of the restrained group were quiet and socially avoidant with unfamiliar children and adults whereas a majority of the more spontaneous children were talkative and interactive. The group differences in peripheral physiological reactions suggest that inherited variation in the threshold of arousal in selected limbic sites may contribute to shyness in childhood and even extreme degrees of social avoidance in adults.

https://openalex.org/W2085486418,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a monocyte-derived cytotoxin that has been implicated in tumor regression, septic shock, and cachexia. The mechanism by which TNF induces these different disease states is unclear. We have identified and characterized a novel, rapidly inducible cell surface cytotoxic integral transmembrane form of TNF. The existence and behavior of this novel form of TNF may explain the complex physiology of this molecule. We suggest that activated monocytes synthesize transmembrane TNF at the site of inflammation and kill their targets by either cell-to-cell contact or local release of the TNF secretory component. In contrast, septic shock and cachexia may result from either acute or chronic systemic activation of monocytes, resulting in the widespread release of TNF secretory component into the circulation of the affected individual. We further suggest that cell borne cytokines and cytotoxins may be the primary mediators of directed inflammatory responses."

https://openalex.org/W2035082518,"We have developed a method for constructing genomic libraries enriched for telomeric DNA sequences, enabling the isolation of telomeres from higher eukaryotic organisms with large chromosomes. The method was used to clone telomeric DNA sequences from the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana. A. thaliana telomeres are composed primarily of tandemly repeated blocks of the sequence 5′-CCCTAAA-3′ and are heterogeneous in size. Genomic sequences that cross-hybridize at high stringency with A. thaliana telomeric repeats are present in other higher plants. In Zea mays (corn), these cross-hybridizing sequences are located at the telomeres. In addition, the A. thaliana telomeric repeats cross-hybridize at low stringency to genomic sequences located at the telomeres of human chromosomes."

Short patches of nucleotides are introduced by excision repair of damaged DNA in an ATP-dependent reaction. Extracts from xeroderma pigmentosum cell lines fail to act on damaged circular DNA, but are proficient in repair synthesis of ultraviolet-irradiated DNA containing incisions generated by Micrococcus luteus pyrimidine dimer-DNA glycosylase. Repair is defective in extracts from all xeroderma pigmentosum cell lines investigated, representing the genetic complementation groups A, B, C, D, H, and V. Mixing of cell extracts of group A and C origin leads to reconstitution of the DNA repair activity."
https://openalex.org/W1601452086,"We recently reported that the purified leukoagglutinin (designated MAL) from the seeds of the leguminous plant Maackia amurensis is a potent leukoagglutinin for the mouse lymphoma cell line BW5147 (Wang, W.-C., and Cummings, R. D. (1987) Anal. Biochem. 161,80). We and others have shown that this lectin is a weak hemagglutinin of human erythrocytes (Kawaguchi, T., Matsumoto, I., and Osawa, T. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2786). We now report that leukoagglutination by MAL is inhibited by low concentrations of 2,3-sialyllactose (NeuAc alpha 2,3Gal beta 1,4Glc), but it is not inhibited by either 2,6-sialyllactose (NeuAc alpha 2,6Gal beta-1,4Glc), lactose, or free NeuAc. To further study the carbohydrate-binding specificity of this lectin, we investigated the interactions of immobilized MAL with glycopeptides prepared from the mouse lymphoma cell line BW5147 and from purified glycoproteins. We found that immobilized MAL interacts with high affinity with complex-type tri- and tetraantennary Asn-linked oligosaccharides containing outer sialic acid residues linked alpha 2,3 to penultimate galactose residues. Glycopeptides containing sialic acid linked only alpha 2,6 to penultimate galactose did not interact detectably with the immobilized lectin. Our analyses indicate that the interactions of complex-type Asn-linked chains with the lectin are dependent on sialic acid linkages and are not dependent on either the branching pattern of the mannose residues or the presence of poly-N-acetyllactosamine sequences."

https://openalex.org/W2009692439,"The increasing demand for DNA sequences can be met by replacement of each DNA sample in a device with a mixture of N samples so that the normal throughput is increased by a factor of N. Such a method is described. In order to separate the sequence information at the end of the processing, the DNA molecules of interest are ligated to a set of oligonucleotide ""tags"" at the beginning. The tagged DNA molecules are pooled, amplified, and chemically fragmented in 96-well plates. The resulting reaction products are fractionated by size on sequencing gels and transferred to nylon membranes. These membranes are then probed as many times as there are types of tags in the original pools, producing, in each cycle of probing, autoradiographs similar to those from standard DNA sequencing methods. Thus, each reaction and gel yields a quantity of data equivalent to that obtained from conventional reactions and gels multiplied by the number of probes used. To date, even after 50 successive probings, the original signal strength and the image quality are retained, an indication that the upper limit for the number of reprobings may be considerably higher."

https://openalex.org/W2016907315,"The protein deamidation process involves the conversion of the amide side-chain moieties of asparagine and glutamine residues to carboxyl groups. This conversion is an unusual form of protein modification in that it requires catalysis by an intramolecular reaction where both the substrate (asparagine and glutamine side chains) and ""catalytic site"" (the peptide nitrogen of the succeeding residue) are constituents of several consecutive residues along the polypeptide chain. The stereochemical factors governing this process were studied with a data base derived from the neutron crystallographic structure of trypsin from which amide groups and oxygen can be unambiguously differentiated because of their different neutron scattering properties. The neutron structure allowed for the direct determination of those residues that were deamidated; 3 of 13 asparagine residues were found to be modified. These modified residues were clearly distinguished by a distinct local conformation and hydrogen-bonding structure in contrast to those observed for the other asparagine residues. No correlation was found between preference to deamidate and the chemical character of residues flanking the site, as had been proposed from previous peptide studies."
https://openalex.org/W1602962366,"Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells cluster in the presence of pertussis toxin, a response that is correlated with the ADP-ribosylation of a Mr = 41,000 membrane protein by the toxin. A ricin-resistant line of CHO cells (CHO-15B) which specifically lacks the terminal NeuAc----Gal beta 4GlcNAc oligosaccharide sequence on glycoproteins did not cluster in response to pertussis toxin. These cells do contain the Mr = 41,000 protein substrate for the enzymatic activity of the toxin which suggests that pertussis toxin, like certain plant lectins, does not bind to or is not internalized by the CHO-15B cells. There was no evidence of pertussis toxin binding to gangliosides or neutral glycolipids isolated from CHO cells but the toxin bound to a Mr = 165,000 component in N-octyglucoside extracts of CHO cells that had been separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted to nitrocellulose. Plant lectins from Ricinus communis and Erythina cristagalli detected a similar size band in CHO cells and also did not react with CHO-15B cells. Unlike pertussis toxin, these plant lectins recognized two other major bands in CHO cell extracts and reacted best after sialidase treatment of nitrocellulose transfers containing CHO cell extracts. Conversely, sialidase treatment abolished binding a pertussis toxin and wheat germ agglutinin, a plant lectin that reacts with multivalent sialic acid residues on glycoproteins, to the Mr = 165,000 band. Purified B oligomer of pertussis toxin also uniquely detected a Mr = 165,000 component in CHO cell extracts while the A subunit of pertussis toxin was unreactive. These results indicate that pertussis toxin binds to a CHO cell glycoprotein with N-linked oligosaccharides and that sialic acid contributes to the complementary receptor site for the toxin. In addition, they suggest that a glycoprotein may serve as a cell surface receptor for pertussis toxin and that this interaction is mediated by a lectin-like binding site located on the B oligomer."

A group of structurally unrelated drugs in concentrations known to reverse MDR, but not the verapamil analog tiapamil, a weak modulator of MDR, had similar effects. This effect was saturated at verapamil concentrations of about 1 μM.These data demonstrate that verapamil concentrations in MDR cells are maintained at a low level at the expense of ATP hydrolysis, and provide a first indication of the amount of metabolic energy used in this process.— Broxterman, H.

https://openalex.org/W1981012036,"The major histocompatibility complex is a chromosomal segment embodying several gene clusters among which those with immune functions are the best characterized. This region is suspected to host other as yet undetected genes whose characterization may shed light on the population genetics and evolution of the whole gene complex and thus on its unexplained character of marker locus for a number of diseases of nonimmune or unknown pathogenesis. A novel gene was identified that is transcribed in all tissues tested and is located in mouse and man between the CA and Bf genes of the H-2 and HLA complexes, respectively. From the nucleotide sequence, derived from liver complementary DNA clones, it is predicted that this novel single-copy gene encodes a 42-kilodalton polypeptide that bears no recognizable relation to the protein families known so far, but it displays striking hallmarks of natural selection."
https://openalex.org/W1507059995,"Monoclonal antibodies were utilized to localize novel heparin-binding domains of laminin. A solid-phase radioligand binding assay was designed such that [3H] heparin bound to laminin in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Tritiated heparin binding to laminin was saturable and specific as determined by competition with unlabeled heparin, dextran sulfate, and dermatan sulfate. By Scatchard analysis, two distinct dissociation constants were calculated (Kd = 50 and 130 nM), suggesting the presence of at least two binding sites for heparin on laminin. Tritiated heparin bound to thrombin-resistant (600 kDa) and chymotrypsin-resistant (440 kDa) laminin fragments, both known to lack the terminal globular domain of the long arm. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels of chymotrypsin- and thermolysin-digested laminin chromatographed on a heparin-Sepharose column showed multiple proteolytic fragments binding to the column. Monoclonal antibodies generated against laminin were tested for their ability to inhibit [3H]heparin binding to laminin. Four monoclonal antibodies significantly inhibited the binding of [3H]heparin to laminin in the range of 15-21% inhibition. Laminin-monoclonal antibody interactions examined by electron microscopy showed that one antibody reacted at the terminal globular domain of the long arm, domain Hep-1, while epitopes for two of these monoclonal antibodies were located on the lateral arms of laminin, domain Hep-2, and the fourth monoclonal antibody bound below the cross-region of laminin, domain Hep-3. When two monoclonal antibodies recognizing distinctly different regions of laminin were added concomitantly, the inhibition of [3H]heparin binding to laminin increased almost 2-fold. These results suggest that at least two novel heparin-binding domains of laminin may be located in domains distinct from the terminal globular domain of the long arm."
https://openalex.org/W1483238427,"An interferon-induced 15-kDa protein is synthesized from a precursor of higher molecular weight; the precursor contains 165 amino acids (17 kDa), whereas the stable product (15 kDa) contains 156 amino acids. The stable 15-kDa form is derived from the precursor 17-kDa form by the removal of eight amino acids from the COOH terminus and the methionine from the NH2 terminus. The existence of the precursor 17-kDa protein can be demonstrated after brief periods of in vivo labeling with [35S]methionine and by translation of mRNA in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1542206400,"The kinetics of agonist-induced increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ have been measured in single A10 vascular smooth muscle cells and rat hepatocytes using fluorescent videomicroscopy with fura-2 as a Ca2+ indicator. At high agonist concentrations there was no difference in the kinetics of the Ca2+ transient measured in vasopressin-stimulated single A10 cells or in cell populations. However, stimulation of single A10 cells with concentrations of vasopressin below 0.5 nM produced characteristic Ca2+ transients composed of two distinct peaks. The two peaks appeared to represent a temporal separation between release of intracellular Ca2+ and influx of extracellular Ca2+. The double transient was not observed in single rat hepatocytes stimulated with low concentrations of vasopressin or phenylephrine. In both A10 cells and hepatocytes, the initial rate of increase in Ca2+ concentrations in response to submaximal agonist concentrations was faster in single cells than in cell populations. This difference was due to asynchrony of the cellular response, where there was a latent period of variable length before onset of a rapid increase in Ca2+ concentration. The duration of the latent period was dependent on the agonist concentration, higher concentrations of agonist giving a reduced latent period. The hormone-stimulated Ca2+ transient measured in single hepatocytes with fura-2 was different from the series of transient spikes as previously reported using aequorin as the Ca2+ indicator, suggesting that fura-2 and aequorin may report different aspects of the Ca2+ response in stimulated cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that measurement of Ca2+ transients in single cells provide novel information concerning the nature of the Ca2+ transient that is not apparent from studies with cell populations."

https://openalex.org/W1513935487,"The final urinary excretion product of selenium detoxification is trimethylselenonium ion. An assay has been developed for the enzyme, S-adenosylmethionine:thioether S-methyltransferase, responsible for this final methylation reaction. This assay employed high pressure liquid chromatography separation and quantitation of the trimethylselenonium ion produced by thioether methyltransferase acting on S-adenosylmethionine and dimethyl selenide. The enzyme was shown to reside primarily in the cytosol of mouse lung (30 pmol/mg protein/min) and liver (7 pmol/mg protein/min). Purification from mouse lung to a preparation that exhibited a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was achieved by DEAE, gel filtration, and chromatofocusing chromatographies. Thioether methyltransferase is monomeric with a molecular weight of 28,000 and has a pI of 5.3. The pH optimum was 6.3, and Km values for dimethyl selenide and S-adenosylmethionine were 0.4 and 1.0 microM, respectively. The enzyme was inhibited 50% by 25 microM sinefungin, an analog of S-adenosylmethionine, or 40 microM S-adenosylhomocysteine, the reaction product. Pure thioether methyltransferase methylated selenium in dimethyl selenide, tellurium in dimethyl telluride, and S in dimethyl sulfide and many other thioethers. These data suggest a general role for this novel enzyme in the synthesis of onium compounds with increased aqueous solubility helpful in their excretion."
https://openalex.org/W1576051719,"The existence of distinct 69- and 100-kDa forms of 2-5A-synthetase in addition to the smaller (40 and 46 kDa) forms has recently been established. Using specific monoclonal antibodies we investigated the induction, synthesis, and activity of 69- and 100-kDa 2',5'-oligoadenylate (2-5A) synthetases in interferon-treated human Daudi cells. Although induction of these synthetases is detectable in cells treated with as little as 1-5 units/ml of human alpha-interferon, higher concentrations are required for maximum synthesis of the 100 kDa than the 69-kDa protein. At 5 units/ml of interferon, enhanced synthesis of both proteins is detectable at 4 h with maximum synthesis occurring between 8 to 12 and 12 to 16 h for 69- and 100-kDa 2-5A-synthetases, respectively. At 24 h after addition of interferon, synthesis of these synthetases declines due to a decrease of active interferon in the culture medium. The synthesis of both synthetases is blocked by actinomycin D, and the half-life of these proteins is estimated to be 8 h. The activities of immunoaffinity purified 69- and 100-kDa synthetases are dependent on double-stranded (ds)RNA but show different requirements for optimum concentration of dsRNA and pH of the reaction. The apparent Km of 69- and 100-kDa synthetases for ATP is 1.7 X 10(-3) M and 3.6 X 10(-3) M, respectively. At optimum conditions for the activity of these enzymes, the pattern of 2',5'-linked oligoadenylates synthesized are different, the 69-kDa protein synthesizing higher oligomers than the 100-kDa species. Taken together, these results indicate that the 69- and 100-kDa 2-5A-synthetases are distinct proteins each with specific characteristics of induction and enzymatic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2149408007,"We have developed a versatile new approach to the simultaneous analysis of families of curves, which combines the simplicity of empirical methods with several of the advantages of mathematical modeling, including objective comparison of curves and statistical hypothesis testing. The method uses weighted smoothing cubic splines; the degree of smoothing is adjusted automatically to satisfy constraints on curve chape (monotonicity, number of inflection points). By simultaneous analysis of a family of curves, one can extract the shape common to all the curves. Up to four linear scaling parameters are used to match the shape to each curve, and to provide optimal superimposition of the several curves. By applying constraints to these scaling factors, one can test a variety of hypotheses concerning comparisons of curves (e.g., identity, parallelism, or similarity of shape of two or more curves), and thus evaluate the effects of experimental manipulation. By optimal pooling of data one can avoid the need for arbitrary selection of a typical experiment, and can detect subtle but reproducible effects that might otherwise be overlooked. This approach can facilitate the development of an appropriate model. The method has been implemented in a Turbo-Pascal program for IBM-PC compatible microcomputers, and in FORTRAN-77 for the DEC-10 mainframe, and has been utilized successfully in a wide variety of applications."
https://openalex.org/W1592250997,"Purified scrapie prions contain one identifiable macromolecule, PrP 27-30, which polymerizes into rod-shaped amyloids. The rods can be dissociated with retention of scrapie infectivity upon incorporation of PrP 27-30 into detergent-lipid-protein complexes (DLPC) as well as liposomes. As measured by end-point titration, scrapie infectivity was increased greater than 100-fold upon dissociating the rods into liposomes. The incorporation of PrP 27-30 into liposomes was demonstrated by immunoelectron microscopy using colloidal gold. Detergent extraction of prion liposomes followed by chloroform/methanol extraction resulted in the reappearance of rods, indicating that this process is reversible. Scrapie prion infectivity in rods and liposomes was equally resistant to inactivation by irradiation at 254 nm and was unaltered by exposure to nucleases. A variety of lipids used for producing DLPC and liposomes did not alter infectivity. Fluorescently labeled PrP 27-30 in liposomes was used to study its entry into cultured cells. Unlike the rods which remained as large fluorescent extracellular masses, the PrP 27-30 in liposomes rapidly entered the cells and was seen widely distributed within the interior of the cell. PrP 27-30 is derived by limited proteolysis from a larger protein designated PrP(Sc) which is membrane bound. PrP(Sc) in membrane fractions was solubilized by incorporation in DLPC, thus preventing its aggregation into amyloid rods. The functional solubilization of scrapie prion proteins in DLPC and liposomes offers new approaches to the study of prion structure and the mechanism by which they cause brain degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W1550120108,"In isolated rat hepatocytes, fatty acids inhibited the side chain oxidation, but not the uptake, of exogenously added 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholestan-26-oic acid (THCA). THCA did not inhibit fatty acid oxidation. In liver homogenates, fatty acids inhibited THCA activation to its CoA ester (THC-CoA) and THCA oxidation. THCA did not influence fatty acid activation or oxidation. Comparison of the THC-CoA concentrations present in the incubation mixtures during THCA oxidation, with substrate concentration curves determined for THC-CoA oxidation, indicated that the inhibition of THCA oxidation by fatty acids was at least partly exerted at the activation step. The inhibition of THCA activation by fatty acids was noncompetitive. Palmitoyl-CoA at concentrations found in the incubation mixtures during THCA oxidation in the presence of palmitate inhibited THC-CoA oxidation, but not sufficiently to fully explain the fatty acid-induced inhibition of THCA oxidation. The inhibition of THC-CoA oxidation by palmitoyl-CoA did not seem to be competitive. Acyl-CoA oxidase, the first enzyme of peroxisomal beta-oxidation (which catalyzes the side chain oxidation of THCA), was enhanced 15-fold in liver homogenates from clofibrate-treated rats when palmitoyl-CoA was the substrate, but the oxidase activity remained unaltered when THC-CoA was the substrate. In the perfused liver, oleate, infused after a wash-out period of 60 min, markedly inhibited bile acid secretion. The results 1) suggest that fatty acids inhibit THCA metabolism both at the activation step and at the peroxisomal beta-oxidation sequence and that separate enzymes may be involved in both the activation and peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids and THCA and 2) raise the question whether fatty acids might (indirectly?) affect overall bile acid synthesis via their inhibitory effect on THCA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2148081346,"The acidic phospholipid requirement for protein kinase C (Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent enzyme) activation has been well established, although the molecular nature of this lipid-protein interaction is unclear. The additional requirement for Ca2+ has provided the basis for several models involving charge interactions. We now report that short chain neutral phosphatidylcholines also activate the kinase. Examination of a large series of phosphatidylcholines of varying acyl chain length revealed a close correlation between the ability to form micelles and the ability to support kinase activity. Peak activation occurred in the concentration range just before the critical micelle concentration of each phospholipid. Activation was absolutely dependent on the presence of Ca2+ and diacylglycerol. The possible roles of Ca2+ and phospholipid in the activation process are reexamined in light of these unexpected results."
https://openalex.org/W2166930264,"The low population densities and impermanent settlements of Amazonian Indians are often interpreted as adaptations to a fauna that offers limited protein resources and is rapidly depleted by hunting. Data spanning the 10-year life cycle of one northwestern Amazonian settlement show that variations in hunt yields result from temporal variations in peccary (Tayassu pecari and T. tajacu) kills that appear extrinsic to native population size. After 10 years, hunting success remained high and the kill rates for most prey did not suggest depletion. An array of environmental factors accounts for the incipient settlement relocation observed."
https://openalex.org/W1659731552,"Uptake of guanidine, an endogenous organic cation, into brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from human term placentas was investigated. Initial uptake rates were manyfold greater in the presence of an outward-directed H+ gradient ([pH]o greater than [pH]i) than in the absence of a H+ gradient ([pH]o = [pH]i). Guanidine was transiently accumulated inside the vesicles against a concentration gradient in the presence of the H+ gradient. The H+ gradient-dependent stimulation of guanidine uptake was not due to a H+-diffusion potential because an ionophore (valinomycin or carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone)-induced inside-negative membrane potential failed to stimulate the uptake. In addition, uphill transport of guanidine could be demonstrated even in voltage-clamped membrane vesicles. The H+ gradient-dependent uptake of guanidine was inhibited by many exogenous as well as endogenous organic cations (cis-inhibition) but not by cationic amino acids. The presence of unlabeled guanidine inside the vesicles stimulated the uptake of labeled guanidine (trans-stimulation). These data provide evidence for the presence of an organic cation-proton antiporter in human placental brush-border membranes. Kinetic analysis of guanidine uptake demonstrated that the uptake occurred via two saturable, carrier-mediated transport systems, one being a high affinity, low capacity type and the other a low affinity, high capacity type. Studies on the effects of various cations on the organic cation-proton antiporter and the Na+-H+ exchanger revealed that these two transport systems are distinct."
https://openalex.org/W1568071497,"Abstract To examine the structural requirements for the intracellular transport and surface expression of Class I histocompatibility molecules, we studied somatic cell variants that produce altered forms of the H-2Kb molecule. One variant, R8.10, produced a mutant Kb molecule that was expressed on the cell surface at about 15% of the wild-type level. Nucleic acid sequence analysis identified the mutation as a single nucleotide change resulting in an amino acid substitution (Trp----Arg) at residue 167 in the alpha 2 extracellular domain. A comparative kinetic analysis of the intracellular transport of the wild-type and mutant molecules revealed that transport of the mutant product was remarkably impaired. Whereas wild-type molecules arrived at the cell surface with a half-time of about 30 min, 80% of newly synthesized mutant molecules did not progress beyond the rough endoplasmic reticulum, where they were slowly degraded. Surprisingly, the remaining 20% of the mutant population was capable of reaching the plasma membrane at a rate about one-half that of wild-type Kb. The accumulation of most of the mutant molecules in the rough endoplasmic reticulum was not due to aggregation or insolubility, nor could it be attributed to a lack of association with beta 2-microglobulin. Several techniques were employed in an effort to detect structural features unique to the transport-deficient mutant population. Monoclonal antibody binding experiments revealed structural differences between wild-type and mutant molecules in the region of the mutation but failed to distinguish the transport-competent and -deficient mutant populations. Detergent partitioning studies were also ineffective in this regard. However, differences between transported and untransported molecules were readily demonstrated by their disparate susceptibilities to proteolytic digestion. The results indicated that the transport-deficient form of the mutant assumed a conformation that was altered relative to both the transport-competent form and the wild-type molecule. The fact that the ability of wild-type and mutant molecules to be transported correlated with conformational features rather than with their specific primary sequences suggests that proper folding is an important requirement for their passage through the exocytotic pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1648382177,"Translocation of diphtheria toxin (DT) or ricin to the cytosol is the rate-limiting step responsible for (pseudo) first-order decline in protein synthesis observed in intoxicated cell populations. The requirements for energy utilization in the translocation of both toxins are examined by perturbing the intoxication during this period of protein synthesis decline. Translocation of either toxin is blocked at 4 degrees C and requires energy. Ricin translocation is tightly coupled to ATP hydrolysis with no involvement of membrane potential. Cell depolarization slows the rate of DT translocation but does not block completely. Elimination of transmembrane pH gradients alone does not affect DT translocation; however, in combination with depolarization, translocation is blocked virtually completely. Energy requirements for DT intoxication are mediated by establishing a plasma membrane potential and a pH gradient across some cellular membrane. It is proposed that a postendocytotic vesicle containing processed DT fuses with the plasma membrane. Either component of the proton motive force across the plasma membrane then drives DT translocation. Ricin apparently utilizes a different energy coupling mechanism at a different intracellular site, thus demonstrating toxin specificity in the translocation mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1583601424,"Abstract To address the claim that filaments polymerized from highly purified (gel-filtered) F-actin acquire the elastic properties of a solid attributable to chemical cross-linking, we measured the rheologic spectrum of the dynamic storage modulus, G', and loss modulus, G'' from 5 x 10(-4) to 0.5 Hz for gel-filtered actin alone and in the presence of the actin shortening protein, gelsolin. We confirmed that gel-filtered filamentous actin is a highly elastic material as evidenced by a relatively frequency-independent G', which is consistent with either topologically constrained filaments or a chemically cross-linked gel. Introduction of gel-filtered actin oligomers, however, caused the behavior of gel-filtered actin to become more frequency-dependent and almost identical to that of non-gel-filtered actin, suggesting that the effect of gel filtration on the mechanical behavior of actin is topologic. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that shortening of the actin filaments by the addition of gelsolin at molar ratios to actin of from 1:8000 to 1:500 causes a gradual decrease in elasticity and increase in the amount of flow."

To test this, we used the natural history of inherited heart disease in hamsters as a sliding scale of organ vulnerability on which we superimposed a constant set of stressors. When the animal was stressed at an early point in its disease, heart failure did not develop. Later, after cardiac compensatory changes had developed, stress precipitated overt heart failure. Finally, stress administered when the animal was in overt heart failure further amplified the medical consequences of stress, and some animals succumbed."
https://openalex.org/W1515999145,"Chemical modification by phenylglyoxal was used to investigate relationships between the structure, function, and regulation of the type II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Modification of the protein kinase by phenylglyoxal resulted in specific labeling of one distinct site, most likely an important arginine residue, with concomitant inactivation of the enzyme. Labeling and inactivation of the protein kinase was prevented by Mg2+-ADP which suggests that modification occurred at, or in close proximity to, its nucleotide-binding pocket. Half-maximal protection by Mg2+-ADP was enhanced by calmodulin which decreased the K0.5 for ADP from 540 to 61 microM. This response of the enzyme to calmodulin indicates that the modulator protein increases the affinity of the protein kinase for nucleotides. Inactivation of the enzyme by phenylglyoxal was dependent on the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+/calmodulin, and further enhanced by the simultaneous addition of these effectors to the reaction. The Mg2+ effect is indicative of binding of this divalent metal ion to the protein kinase even in the absence of calmodulin and nucleotides. The stimulation of the modification reaction by calmodulin indicates an increase in the reactivity or accessibility of the modified residue in response to calmodulin-regulated conformational changes on the enzyme. The calmodulin-induced changes observed in this study may play important roles in the molecular mechanisms of activation of the type II calmodulin-dependent protein kinase."

Small subunit 18 S RNA contains 2 residues of N6,N6-dimethyladenosine 19 and 20 residues from the 3'-end (Hagenbuchle, O., Santer, M., Steitz, J. A., and Mans, R. J. (1978) Cell 13, 551-563). Nucleoside analysis by high performance liquid chromatography shows no other residues of this component in the RNA. Anti-dimethyladenosine immunoglobulins were reacted with wheat germ 40 S subunits, and the resulting complexes were studied by electron microscopy in order to localize the nucleoside. In about 90% of the complexes observed, antibody-subunit contact was consistent with a single binding site. We place the dimethyladenosine residues at or near the end of the platform of the 40 S particle in a position nearly equivalent to that previously identified in prokaryotic and chloroplast subunits (Trempe, M. R., and Glitz, D. G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 11873-11879)."
https://openalex.org/W1545878695,"Isolated hamster hearts were perfused with 2% ethanol for 30 min and then reequilibrated with control medium. One group of hamsters was pretreated with verapamil. Another group received diltiazem. Myocardial verapamil levels were 9.5 +/- 0.7 mg/g dry wt; diltiazem levels were 22 +/- 7 mg/g dry wt. Energy metabolites were assessed by using 31P NMR standardized with high-pressure liquid chromatography of freeze-clamped tissue. Intracellular calcium was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, marking the extracellular space with K(CoEDTA). After 30 min of perfusion, untreated hamster hearts showed a 74% decrease in developed pressure, a marked increase in end-diastolic pressure, a decrease of ATP from 9.8 to 8.8 mmol, and an increase of Pi from 6.7 to 9.8 mmol, but no change of phosphocreatine (PCr) or intracellular pH (pHi). Verapamil pretreatment partially prevented cardiac depression during alcohol perfusion. Whereas diltiazem had no protective effect. After reequilibration, developed pressure and oxygen consumption significantly exceeded control values. ATP decreased to 8 mmol; pHi, PCr, and Pi showed no significant change. Verapamil-pretreated hearts showed better performance than untreated hearts without change in PCr and Pi, whereas ATP dropped slightly to 8.7 mmol. Thus, functional cardiac depression resulting from acute alcohol exposure is reversible. Increased intracellular calcium levels during alcohol exposure normalized after the removal of alcohol. There was no major change in high-energy phosphates during alcohol exposure or after the removal of alcohol. Verapamil protects the heart from functional depression during alcohol exposure without affecting energy resources."
https://openalex.org/W2099292070,"We present evidence that normal hepatocytes can be specifically protected from galactosamine toxicity in vitro by targeting an antagonist to these cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The strategy is based upon the following principles: 1) galactosamine is a highly selective hepatotoxin that causes a dose-dependent depletion of uridine intermediates; 2) galactosamine toxicity can be antagonized by supplemental administration of uridine; 3) normal hepatocytes possess unique cell-surface receptors that can internalize galactose terminal (asialo-)glycoproteins with subsequent degradation of the glycoprotein ligand. Based on these facts, we hypothesized that chemical coupling of a galactosamine antagonist to an asialoglycoprotein could result in cell-specific delivery and protection of normal hepatocytes by targeting the antagonist via asialoglycoprotein receptors. Using a model system consisting of freshly isolated rat hepatocytes (receptor (+)) and Morris 7777 rat hepatoma (receptor (-)) cells, sensitivity to galactosamine in vitro was determined and found to be similar for both types of cells. A targetable antagonist was synthesized by coupling uridine monophosphate to asialoorosomucoid in a molar ratio of 5 to 1. Exposure of Morris 7777 cells to the targetable antagonist in the presence of a toxic concentration of galactosamine did not protect these cells as evidenced by a steady decline in the number of viable cells in a fashion identical to cells treated with galactosamine alone. However, normal hepatocytes that received the conjugate in the presence of galactosamine were protected as their viable cell number remained the same as control (untreated) cells. Competition by an excess of asialoglycoprotein inhibited the protective effect of the conjugate, supporting the concept that the asialoglycoprotein component of the conjugate was responsible for the specific delivery of the antagonist to the target cells."

https://openalex.org/W2110222118,"Human urine contains a hitherto unrecognized heparin-dependent inhibitor of activated protein C (APC) (Mr approximately 50,000) that coelutes from heparin-Sepharose together with the only observed peak of urokinase inhibitory activity at a position (0.35 M NaCl) similar to that of plasma protein C (PC) inhibitor. Based on functional assays and immunoblot studies, urokinase and APC compete for this crude inhibitor in the absence or presence of heparin. These results suggest that the same heparin-dependent urinary inhibitor that is immunologically different from several known protease inhibitors is responsible for the observed inhibition of APC and urokinase. In the absence of heparin this inhibitor inhibits APC and urokinase with similar rates, and heparin enhances its inhibitory activity toward both enzymes with more pronounced stimulation of its PC inhibitory activity than its urokinase inhibitory activity. Half-maximal stimulation of inhibition of APC occurs at about 2 mU/ml and maximal stimulation (approximately 10-fold increase of the pseudo-first-order rate constant) at greater than or equal to 50 mU/ml of heparin. This is the first demonstration of competition between APC and urokinase for a heparin-dependent inhibitor. These results may therefore represent a new link between the two major antithrombotic pathways, the PC pathway and the fibrinolytic system."
https://openalex.org/W1532156381,"The release of a chromophoric analogue of GDP, 2-amino-6-mercaptopurine riboside 5'-diphosphate (thioGDP), from its complex with elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) is catalyzed by elongation factor Ts (EF-Ts). The mechanism of this reaction includes a ternary complex; EF-Tu.thioGDP.EF-Ts (Eccleston, J. F. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12997-13003). This mechanism has been further investigated using pressure relaxation techniques combined with spectrophotometric measurements. The equilibrium of a solution of EF-Tu, EF-Ts, and thioGDP over a range of concentrations is perturbed on increasing the pressure to 150 atm. Rapid decrease of the pressure back to 1 atm results in a biphasic relaxation process, an initial fast phase which is complete within 1 ms followed by a slower phase. This is interpreted as the result of an isomerization of the EF-Tu.thioGDP.EF-Ts ternary complex which occurs before the release of thioGDP. Such an isomerization process may be a general feature in the release of GDP from guanosine nucleotide-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1987537428,The feasibility of electric field x-ray solution scattering with biological macromolecules was investigated. Electric field pulses (1.25 to 5.5 kilovolts per centimeter) were used to orient tobacco mosaic virus in solution (4.5 milligrams per milliliter). The x-ray scattering is characteristic of isolated oriented particles. The molecular orientation and its field-free decay were monitored with a time resolution of 2 milliseconds by means of synchrotron radiation and a multiwire proportional area detector. The method should also be applicable to synthetic polymers and inorganic colloids.
https://openalex.org/W1526606557,"Nucleoside analysis of the RNA from the small subunit of wheat germ cytoplasmic ribosomes shows 1 mol each of N7-methylguanosine and N6-methyladenosine/mol of RNA. Antibodies directed against each methylated nucleoside were used to localize these residues within the subunit by electron microscopy of immune complexes. Antibodies to 7-methylguanosine bound 40 S subunits at a single site, at or slightly above the division between the upper and lower segments of the particle and on the surface furthest from the platform (or large lobe) of the subunit. This site is essentially equivalent to that previously seen with Escherichia coli and chloroplast 30 S subunits (Trempe, M. R., Ohgi, K., and Glitz, D. G. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 9822-9829). Antibodies to N6-monomethyladenosine were induced in rabbits with a nucleoside-albumin conjugate and shown to be specific for the modified nucleoside. Electron microscopy of antibody-subunit complexes placed the methyladenosine residue in a position that is essentially indistinguishable from that of 7-methylguanosine."
https://openalex.org/W1527943342,"When insulin receptors of rat skeletal muscle sarcolemmal vesicles were solubilized with Triton X-100, the specific binding of 125I-labeled insulin increased by more than 10-fold over that seen in the intact vesicles. Partial purification of the skeletal muscle insulin receptors on wheat germ agglutinin affinity columns increased the total insulin binding activity by 7-fold and reduced the Kd for insulin binding from 1.92 to 0.20 nM, suggesting that an inhibitor of insulin binding was removed by this purification step. This was confirmed when the unbound fractions of the affinity column were dialyzed and reconstituted with the insulin receptors. The inhibitory activity in the sarcolemmal extract could not be accounted for by the presence of Triton X-100. The skeletal muscle inhibitor was more potent in inhibiting insulin binding to skeletal muscle insulin receptors than to liver or adipose receptors. The inhibitor was very effective in inhibiting insulin binding to wheat germ agglutinin-purified IM-9 receptors, but had negligible effects on insulin binding to intact IM-9 cells. The properties of the alpha and beta subunits of the skeletal muscle insulin receptors appear to be the same as those of insulin receptors of other tissues: cross-linking of 125I-labeled insulin to the receptor revealed a band of 130,000 daltons, and insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of bands of 90,000 and 95,000 daltons in the receptor preparation. The skeletal muscle insulin binding inhibitor elutes from molecular sieves in a major 160,000-dalton peak and minor 75,000-dalton peak. The binding inhibitor is not inactivated by heat, by mercaptoethanol, or by trypsin, pepsin, or proteinase K. Collectively, these data suggest that the inhibitor may be a small molecule that aggregates with itself, with larger proteins, or with detergent micelles."
