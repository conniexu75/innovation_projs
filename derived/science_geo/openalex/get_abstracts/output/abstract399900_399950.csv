https://openalex.org/W2067387759,"The retrovirus XMRV (xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus) has been detected in human prostate tumors and in blood samples from patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, but these findings have not been replicated. We hypothesized that an understanding of when and how XMRV first arose might help explain the discrepant results. We studied human prostate cancer cell lines CWR22Rv1 and CWR-R1, which produce XMRV virtually identical to the viruses recently found in patient samples, as well as their progenitor human prostate tumor xenograft (CWR22) that had been passaged in mice. We detected XMRV infection in the two cell lines and in the later passage xenografts, but not in the early passages. In particular, we found that the host mice contained two proviruses, PreXMRV-1 and PreXMRV-2, which share 99.92% identity with XMRV over >3.2-kilobase stretches of their genomes. We conclude that XMRV was not present in the original CWR22 tumor but was generated by recombination of two proviruses during tumor passaging in mice. The probability that an identical recombinant was generated independently is negligible (~10(-12)); our results suggest that the association of XMRV with human disease is due to contamination of human samples with virus originating from this recombination event."
https://openalex.org/W2072678733,"Despite their importance for the spread of zoonotic diseases, our understanding of the dynamical aspects characterizing the movements of farmed animal populations remains limited as these systems are traditionally studied as static objects and through simplified approximations. By leveraging on the network science approach, here we are able for the first time to fully analyze the longitudinal dataset of Italian cattle movements that reports the mobility of individual animals among farms on a daily basis. The complexity and inter-relations between topology, function and dynamical nature of the system are characterized at different spatial and time resolutions, in order to uncover patterns and vulnerabilities fundamental for the definition of targeted prevention and control measures for zoonotic diseases. Results show how the stationarity of statistical distributions coexists with a strong and non-trivial evolutionary dynamics at the node and link levels, on all timescales. Traditional static views of the displacement network hide important patterns of structural changes affecting nodes' centrality and farms' spreading potential, thus limiting the efficiency of interventions based on partial longitudinal information. By fully taking into account the longitudinal dimension, we propose a novel definition of dynamical motifs that is able to uncover the presence of a temporal arrow describing the evolution of the system and the causality patterns of its displacements, shedding light on mechanisms that may play a crucial role in the definition of preventive actions."
https://openalex.org/W2075251933,"Saxitoxin is a potent neurotoxin that occurs in aquatic environments worldwide. Ingestion of vector species can lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning, a severe human illness that may lead to paralysis and death. In freshwaters, the toxin is produced by prokaryotic cyanobacteria; in marine waters, it is associated with eukaryotic dinoflagellates. However, several studies suggest that saxitoxin is not produced by dinoflagellates themselves, but by co-cultured bacteria. Here, we show that genes required for saxitoxin synthesis are encoded in the nuclear genomes of dinoflagellates. We sequenced >1.2×106 mRNA transcripts from the two saxitoxin-producing dinoflagellate strains Alexandrium fundyense CCMP1719 and A. minutum CCMP113 using high-throughput sequencing technology. In addition, we used in silico transcriptome analyses, RACE, qPCR and conventional PCR coupled with Sanger sequencing. These approaches successfully identified genes required for saxitoxin-synthesis in the two transcriptomes. We focused on sxtA, the unique starting gene of saxitoxin synthesis, and show that the dinoflagellate transcripts of sxtA have the same domain structure as the cyanobacterial sxtA genes. But, in contrast to the bacterial homologs, the dinoflagellate transcripts are monocistronic, have a higher GC content, occur in multiple copies, contain typical dinoflagellate spliced-leader sequences and eukaryotic polyA-tails. Further, we investigated 28 saxitoxin-producing and non-producing dinoflagellate strains from six different genera for the presence of genomic sxtA homologs. Our results show very good agreement between the presence of sxtA and saxitoxin-synthesis, except in three strains of A. tamarense, for which we amplified sxtA, but did not detect the toxin. Our work opens for possibilities to develop molecular tools to detect saxitoxin-producing dinoflagellates in the environment."

At 6 months of age infants can discriminate individual faces from their own and other races. By 9 months of age this ability to process other-race faces is typically lost, due to minimal experience with other-race faces, and vast exposure to own-race faces, for which infants come to manifest expertise [1]. This is known as the Other Race Effect. In the current study, we demonstrate that exposing Caucasian infants to Chinese faces through perceptual training via picture books for a total of one hour between 6 and 9 months allows Caucasian infants to maintain the ability to discriminate Chinese faces at 9 months of age. The development of the processing of face race can be modified by training, highlighting the importance of early experience in shaping the face representation."
https://openalex.org/W1991964554,"Chronic inflammation of the lung, as a consequence of persistent bacterial infections by several opportunistic pathogens represents the main cause of mortality and morbidity in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Mechanisms leading to increased susceptibility to bacterial infections in CF are not completely known, although the involvement of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in microbicidal functions of macrophages is emerging. Tissue macrophages differentiate in situ from infiltrating monocytes, additionally, mature macrophages from different tissues, although having a number of common activities, exhibit variation in some molecular and cellular functions. In order to highlight possible intrinsic macrophage defects due to CFTR dysfunction, we have focused our attention on in vitro differentiated macrophages from human peripheral blood monocytes. Here we report on the contribution of CFTR in the bactericidal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa of monocyte derived human macrophages. At first, by real time PCR, immunofluorescence and patch clamp recordings we demonstrated that CFTR is expressed and is mainly localized to surface plasma membranes of human monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) where it acts as a cAMP-dependent chloride channel. Next, we evaluated the bactericidal activity of P. aeruginosa infected macrophages from healthy donors and CF patients by antibiotic protection assays. Our results demonstrate that control and CF macrophages do not differ in the phagocytic activity when infected with P. aeruginosa. Rather, although a reduction of intracellular live bacteria was detected in both non-CF and CF cells, the percentage of surviving bacteria was significantly higher in CF cells. These findings further support the role of CFTR in the fundamental functions of innate immune cells including eradication of bacterial infections by macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1973341624,"Members of the gammaretroviruses--such as murine leukemia viruses (MLVs), most notably XMRV [xenotropic murine leukemia virus (X-MLV)-related virus--have been reported to be present in the blood of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). We evaluated blood samples from 61 patients with CFS from a single clinical practice, 43 of whom had previously been identified as XMRV-positive. Our analysis included polymerase chain reaction and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction procedures for detection of viral nucleic acids and assays for detection of infectious virus and virus-specific antibodies. We found no evidence of XMRV or other MLVs in these blood samples. In addition, we found that these gammaretroviruses were strongly (X-MLV) or partially (XMRV) susceptible to inactivation by sera from CFS patients and healthy controls, which suggested that establishment of a successful MLV infection in humans would be unlikely. Consistent with previous reports, we detected MLV sequences in commercial laboratory reagents. Our results indicate that previous evidence linking XMRV and MLVs to CFS is likely attributable to laboratory contamination."
https://openalex.org/W2088845956,"BH3 mimetics are small molecules designed or discovered to mimic the binding of BH3-only proteins to the hydrophobic groove of antiapoptotic BCL2 proteins. The selectivity of these molecules for BCL2, BCL-X(L), or MCL1 has been established in vitro; whether they inhibit these proteins in cells has not been rigorously investigated. In this study, we used a panel of leukemia cell lines to assess the ability of seven putative BH3 mimetics to inhibit antiapoptotic proteins in a cell-based system. We show that ABT-737 is the only BH3 mimetic that inhibits BCL2 as assessed by displacement of BAD and BIM from BCL2. The other six BH3 mimetics activate the endoplasmic reticulum stress response inducing ATF4, ATF3, and NOXA, which can then bind to and inhibit MCL1. In most cancer cells, inhibition of one antiapoptotic protein does not acutely induce apoptosis. However, by combining two BH3 mimetics, one that inhibits BCL2 and one that induces NOXA, apoptosis is induced within 6 h in a BAX/BAK-dependent manner. Because MCL1 is a major mechanism of resistance to ABT-737, these results suggest a novel strategy to overcome this resistance. Our findings highlight a novel signaling pathway through which many BH3 mimetics inhibit MCL1 and suggest the potential use of these agents as adjuvants in combination with various chemotherapy strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2035641637,"Unresolved inflammation underlies the development of fibrosis and organ failure. Here, we investigate the potential of the proresolving eicosanoid lipoxinA₄ (LXA₄) and its synthetic analog benzo-LXA₄ to prophylactically modulate fibrotic and inflammatory responses in a model of early renal fibrosis, unilateral ureteric obstruction (UUO). Male Wistar rats (Animalia, Chordata, Rattus norvegicus) were injected intravenously with vehicle (0.1% ethanol), LXA₄ (45 μg/250-g rat), or benzo-LXA₄ (15 μg/250-g rat) 15 min prior to surgery and sacrificed 3 d postligation. Renal gene and protein expression, collagen deposition, macrophage infiltration, and apoptosis were analyzed using manipulated kidneys from sham operations as control. Lipoxins (LXs) attenuated collagen deposition and renal apoptosis (P<0.05) and shifted the inflammatory milieu toward resolution, inhibiting TNF-α and IFN-γ expression, while stimulating proresolving IL-10. LXs attenuated UUO-induced activation of MAP kinases, Akt, and Smads (P<0.05) in injured kidneys. We explored whether the underlying mechanism reflected LX-induced modulation of fibroblast activation. Using cultured rat renal NRK-49F fibroblasts, we report that LXA₄ (1 nM) inhibits TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml)-induced activation of Smad2 and MAP-kinases (P<0.05), and furthermore, LXA₄ reduced TGF-β1-stimulated PAI-1 luciferase activation (P<0.05) relative to vehicle-stimulated cells. We propose that LXs may represent a potentially useful and novel therapeutic strategy for consideration in the context of renal fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2082745597,"The main purpose of the present study is to envisage the molecular mechanism of inhibitory action of dehydrocostuslactone (DCE) and costunolide (CS), two naturally occurring sesquiterpene lactones, towards the activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). We report that, in human THP-1 cell line, they inhibit IL-6-elicited tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 and its DNA binding activity with EC(50) of 10 µM with concomitant down-regulation of the phosphorylation of the tyrosine Janus kinases JAK1, JAK2 and Tyk2. Furthermore, these compounds that contain an α-β-unsaturated carbonyl moiety and function as potent Michael reaction acceptor, induce a rapid drop in intracellular glutathione (GSH) concentration by direct interaction with it, thereby triggering S-glutathionylation of STAT3. Dehydrocostunolide (HCS), the reduced form of CS lacking only the α-β-unsaturated carbonyl group, fails to exert any inhibitory action. Finally, the glutathione ethylene ester (GEE), the cell permeable GSH form, reverts the inhibitory action of DCE and CS on STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation. We conclude that these two sesquiterpene lactones are able to induce redox-dependent post-translational modification of cysteine residues of STAT3 protein in order to regulate its function."
https://openalex.org/W2074299540,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are currently strong candidates for cell-based therapies. They are well known for their differentiation potential and immunoregulatory properties and have been proven to be potentially effective in the treatment of a large variety of diseases, including neurodegenerative disorders. Currently there is no treatment that provides consistent long-term benefits for patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA), a fatal late onset α-synucleinopathy. Principally neuroprotective or regenerative strategies, including cell-based therapies, represent a powerful approach for treating MSA. In this study we investigated the efficacy of intravenously applied MSCs in terms of behavioural improvement, neuroprotection and modulation of neuroinflammation in the (PLP)-αsynuclein (αSYN) MSA model.MSCs were intravenously applied in aged (PLP)-αSYN transgenic mice. Behavioural analyses, defining fine motor coordination and balance capabilities as well as stride length analysis, were performed to measure behavioural outcome. Neuroprotection was assessed by quantifying TH neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). MSC treatment on neuroinflammation was analysed by cytokine measurements (IL-1α, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17, GM-CSF, INFγ, MCP-1, TGF-β1, TNF-α) in brain lysates together with immunohistochemistry for T-cells and microglia. Four weeks post MSC treatment we observed neuroprotection in the SNc, as well as downregulation of cytokines involved in neuroinflammation. However, there was no behavioural improvement after MSC application.To our knowledge this is the first experimental approach of MSC treatment in a transgenic MSA mouse model. Our data suggest that intravenously infused MSCs have a potent effect on immunomodulation and neuroprotection. Our data warrant further studies to elucidate the efficacy of systemically administered MSCs in transgenic MSA models."
https://openalex.org/W2133670735,"The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism through which Sphingosine kinase-1 (SPHK1) exerts its anti-apoptosis activity in glioma cancer cells. We here report that dysregulation of SPHK1 alters the sensitivity of glioma to apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Further mechanistic study examined the expression of Bcl-2 family members, including Bcl-2, Mcl-1, Bax and Bim, in SPHK1-overexpressing glioma cells and revealed that only pro-apoptotic Bim was downregulated by SPHK1. Moreover, the transcriptional level of Bim was also altered by SPHK1 in glioma cells. We next confirmed the correlation between SPHK1 and Bim expression in primary glioma specimens. Importantly, increasing SPHK1 expression in glioma cells markedly elevated Akt activity and phosphorylated inactivation of FOXO3a, which led to downregulation of Bim. A pharmacological approach showed that these effects of SPHK1 were dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). Furthermore, effects of SPHK1 on Akt/FOXO3a/Bim pathway could be reversed by SPHK1 specific RNA interference or SPHK1 inhibitor. Collectively, our results indicate that regulation of the Akt/FOXO3a/Bim pathway may be a novel mechanism by which SPHK1 protects glioma cells from apoptosis, thereby involved in glioma tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2033604633,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common life-limiting recessive genetic disease among Caucasians caused by mutations of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) with over 95% male patients infertile. However, whether CFTR mutations could affect spermatogenesis and result in azoospermia remains an open question. Here we report compromised spermatogenesis, with significantly reduced testicular weight and sperm count, and decreased cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) expression in the testes of CFTR knockout mice. The involvement of CFTR in HCO(3) (-) transport and the expression of the HCO(3) (-) sensor, soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), are demonstrated for the first time in the primary culture of rat Sertoli cells. Inhibition of CFTR or depletion of HCO(3) (-) could reduce FSH-stimulated, sAC-dependent cAMP production and phosphorylation of CREB, the key transcription factor in spermatogenesis. Decreased CFTR and CREB expression are also observed in human testes with azoospermia. The present study reveals a previously undefined role of CFTR and sAC in regulating the cAMP-CREB signaling pathway in Sertoli cells, defect of which may result in impaired spermatogenesis and azoospermia. Altered CFTR-sAC-cAMP-CREB functional loop may also underline the pathogenesis of various CF-related diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1997484488,"Background Converging evidence suggests that inflammatory processes significantly influence brain injury and clinical impairment in ischemic stroke. Although early studies suggested a key role of lymphocytes, recent data has emphasized the orchestrating function of innate immunity, i.e., macrophages and microglia. The bifunctional receptor and ectoenzyme CD38 synthesizes calcium-mobilizing second messengers (e.g., cyclic ADP-ribose), which have been shown to be necessary for activation and migration of myeloid immune cells. Therefore, we investigated the dynamics of CD38 in stroke and the impact of CD38-deficiency on cytokine production, inflammation and cerebral damage in a mouse model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that the local expression of the chemokine MCP-1 was attenuated in CD38-deficient mice compared with wildtype mice after focal cerebral ischemia and reperfusion. In contrast, no significant induction of MCP-1 expression was observed in peripheral blood after 6 hours. Flow cytometry analysis revealed less infiltrating macrophages and lymphocytes in the ischemic hemisphere of CD38-deficient mice, whereas the amount of resident microglia was unaltered. An up-regulation of CD38 expression was observed in macrophages and CD8+ cells after focal cerebral ischemia in wildtype mice, whereas CD38 expression was unchanged in microglia. Finally, we demonstrate that CD38-deficiency decreases the cerebral ischemic injury and the persistent neurological deficit after three days of reperfusion in this murine temporary middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) model. Conclusion/Significance CD38 is differentially regulated following stroke and its deficiency attenuates the postischemic chemokine production, the immune cell infiltration and the cerebral injury after temporary ischemia and reperfusion. Therefore CD38 might prove a therapeutic target in ischemic stroke."
https://openalex.org/W2088817509,"The relationship between phage and their microbial hosts is difficult to elucidate in complex natural ecosystems. Engineered systems performing enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR), offer stable, lower complexity communities for studying phage-host interactions. Here, metagenomic data from an EBPR reactor dominated by Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis (CAP), led to the recovery of three complete and six partial phage genomes. Heat-stable nucleoid structuring (H-NS) protein, a global transcriptional repressor in bacteria, was identified in one of the complete phage genomes (EPV1), and was most similar to a homolog in CAP. We infer that EPV1 is a CAP-specific phage and has the potential to repress up to 6% of host genes based on the presence of putative H-NS binding sites in the CAP genome. These genes include CRISPR associated proteins and a Type III restriction-modification system, which are key host defense mechanisms against phage infection. Further, EPV1 was the only member of the phage community found in an EBPR microbial metagenome collected seven months prior. We propose that EPV1 laterally acquired H-NS from CAP providing it with a means to reduce bacterial defenses, a selective advantage over other phage in the EBPR system. Phage encoded H-NS could constitute a previously unrecognized weapon in the phage-host arms race."
https://openalex.org/W1968881011,"We assessed the occurrence of algae in five species of tank-bromeliads found in contrasting environmental sites in a Neotropical, primary rainforest around the Nouragues Research Station, French Guiana. The distributions of both algal abundance and biomass were examined based on physical parameters, the morphological characteristics of bromeliad species and with regard to the structure of other aquatic microbial communities held in the tanks. Algae were retrieved in all of the bromeliad species with mean densities ranging from ∼10(2) to 10(4) cells/mL. Their biomass was positively correlated to light exposure and bacterial biomass. Algae represented a tiny component of the detrital food web in shaded bromeliads but accounted for up to 30 percent of the living microbial carbon in the tanks of Catopsis berteroniana, located in a highly exposed area. Thus, while nutrient supplies are believed to originate from wind-borne particles and trapped insects (i.e., allochtonous organic matter), our results indicate that primary producers (i.e., autochtonous organic matter) are present in this insectivorous bromeliad. Using a 24-h incubation of size-fractionated and manipulated samples from this plant, we evaluated the impact of mosquito foraging on algae, other microorganisms and rotifers. The prey assemblages were greatly altered by the predation of mosquito larvae. Grazing losses indicated that the dominant algal taxon, Bumilleriopsis sp., like protozoa and rotifers, is a significant part of the diet of mosquito larvae. We conclude that algae are a relevant functional community of the aquatic food web in C. berteroniana and might form the basis of a complementary non-detrital food web."
https://openalex.org/W2147615881,"The gene regulatory circuit motif in which two opposing fate-determining transcription factors inhibit each other but activate themselves has been used in mathematical models of binary cell fate decisions in multipotent stem or progenitor cells. This simple circuit can generate multistability and explains the symmetric ""poised"" precursor state in which both factors are present in the cell at equal amounts as well as the resolution of this indeterminate state as the cell commits to either cell fate characterized by an asymmetric expression pattern of the two factors. This establishes the two alternative stable attractors that represent the two fate options. It has been debated whether cooperativity of molecular interactions is necessary to produce such multistability.Here we take a general modeling approach and argue that this question is not relevant. We show that non-linearity can arise in two distinct models in which no explicit interaction between the two factors is assumed and that distinct chemical reaction kinetic formalisms can lead to the same (generic) dynamical system form. Moreover, we describe a novel type of bifurcation that produces a degenerate steady state that can explain the metastable state of indeterminacy prior to cell fate decision-making and is consistent with biological observations.The general model presented here thus offers a novel principle for linking regulatory circuits with the state of indeterminacy characteristic of multipotent (stem) cells."
https://openalex.org/W2001198044,"Areas that are endemic for malaria are also highly endemic for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Nevertheless, it is unknown whether HBV infection modifies the clinical presentation of malaria. This study aimed to address this question.An observational study of 636 individuals was performed in Rondônia, western Amazon, Brazil between 2006 and 2007. Active and passive case detections identified Plasmodium infection by field microscopy and nested Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). HBV infections were identified by serology and confirmed by real-time PCR. Epidemiological information and plasma cytokine profiles were studied. The data were analyzed using adjusted multinomial logistic regression. Plasmodium-infected individuals with active HBV infection were more likely to be asymptomatic (OR: 120.13, P<0.0001), present with lower levels of parasitemia and demonstrate a decreased inflammatory cytokine profile. Nevertheless, co-infected individuals presented higher HBV viremia. Plasmodium parasitemia inversely correlated with plasma HBV DNA levels (r = -0.6; P = 0.0003).HBV infection diminishes the intensity of malaria infection in individuals from this endemic area. This effect seems related to cytokine balance and control of inflammatory responses. These findings add important insights to the understanding of the factors affecting the clinical outcomes of malaria in endemic regions."

Cell. 2000; 102: 549-552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is a versatile post-translational modification mechanism that eukaryotic cells use mainly to control protein levels through proteasome-mediated proteolysis. The large number and variety of proteins regulated by ubiquitination demand that the process be highly specific; this specificity is governed by the E3 ligases, which comprise a large (and growing) protein family. Many TRIMs have been described as having E3 ligase activity, and the precise substrates of some (but not all) have been identified (15Meroni G. Diez-Roux G.

Latres E. Baumhueter S. Lai V.K. Nunez L. Clarke B.A. Poueymirou W.T. Panaro F.J. Na E. Dharmarajan K. Pan Z.Q. Valenzuela D.M. DeChiara T.M. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1704-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (2665) Google Scholar). The substrates for the other TRIMs have not yet been fully identified. A relative decrease in the amount of anti-apoptotic molecules results in cell death. Anti-apoptotic proteins, such as the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), and Bcl-2, may be targeted by proteasomes (31Zhang H.G. Wang J. Yang X. Hsu H.C. Mountz J.D. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 2009-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Among IAPs, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is often overexpressed in malignant cells, where it inhibits apoptosis triggered by multiple stimuli (e.g. the mitochondrial, death receptor, and endoplasmic reticulum-mediated pathways of caspase activation) and is associated with poor clinical outcome in certain patients (32Schimmer A.D. Dalili S. Batey R.A. Riedl S.J. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). XIAP has been considered a promising target for anti-cancer therapeutics as its degradation is necessary for rapid initiation of the death pathway (33Vucic D. Fairbrother W.J. Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 5995-6000Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). However, no specific E3 ligase activity (except the autoubiquitination of IAPs) has previously been identified as governing XIAP ubiquitination. Here, we show for the first time that TRIM32 has specific E3 ligase activity against XIAP and further investigate the role of TRIM32 in tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate that TRIM32 interacts directly with and down-regulates XIAP through its RING domain-dependent E3 ligase activity. The full-length human TRIM32 cDNA (IMAGE clone H2906024) was used as a template for PCR-mediated generation of expression constructs. The cDNA fragments encoding the RING finger (amino acids 1–96), B-box (amino acids 97–135), coiled-coil (amino acids 136–254), NHL domain (amino acids 255–653), Tat-interacting domain (amino acids 526–653), RING finger-B-box-coiled-coil domain (amino acids 1–254), and full-length TRIM32 (amino acids 1–653) were PCR-amplified and subcloned into the pFLAG-CMV-2 (Sigma), C-terminally HA-tagged pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), or pEBG vectors for mammalian cell transfection experiments. The full-length human TRIM32 cDNA was also subcloned into the pET30b (Novagen) vector for the production of recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. The TRIM32 mutants were generated by deletions of RING finger, B-box, or coiled-coil domain using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Full-length XIAP was cloned into pFLAG-CMV-2, pEGFP-C2 (Clontech), and pET28a (Novagen). The truncated mutants of XIAP encoding amino acids 123–497 (ΔBIR1), 1–123 and 261–497 (ΔBIR2), and 352–497 (ΔBIR123) were generated by PCR with the full-length XIAP as template and cloned into pFLAG-CMV-2 vector. The ΔBIR3 (amino acids 1–263 and 330–497) and ΔRING (amino acids 1–448 and 485–497) mutants of XIAP were generated by using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with pFLAG-CMV-2 vector encoding full-length XIAP as template. All cDNAs were confirmed by direct sequencing. Recombinant His6-tagged TRIM32 was prepared using Ni2+ affinity purification procedures (Novagen). Mouse and rabbit polyclonal antibodies were obtained by immunizing mice and rabbits with purified TRIM32 proteins. The TRIM32 antibodies specifically recognize recombinant and native TRIM32. To establish a cell line stably overexpressing full-length human TRIM32, we used the pMSCVpuro vector (Clontech). Retroviral stocks were produced according to the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Briefly, GP-293 packaging cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and cotransfected with pVSV-G (Clontech) and the recombinant retroviral vector (pMSCVpuro or pMSCVpuroTRIM32) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). After transfection, the cells were incubated at 32 °C to increase the viral titer. Forty-eight hours later, supernatants containing the retroviral particles were collected, filtered through 0.45-μm filters, and used to infect target cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). Infected cells were thereafter selected through incubation with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). For the down-regulation of TRIM32 expression, shRNAs were designed using the BLOCK-iTTM RNAi designer (Invitrogen). The selected sense sequences were 5′-GGTGGAAAGCTTTGGTGTTTC-3′ (shTRIM32 1467–1488). Complementary oligonucleotides consisting of sense, hairpin loop, and antisense sequences were annealed and ligated into the pLenti/H1/TO shRNA expression vector (Invitrogen). The lentivirus and stably transfected cells were generated according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Briefly, HEK293T cells were plated in 100-mm dishes and cotransfected with pLP1, pLP2, pVSV-G (Invitrogen), and recombinant retroviral (pLenti/H1/TOpuro or pLenti/H1/TOsh1467) vectors using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Forty-eight hours after transfection, supernatants containing the lentiviral particles were collected and used to infect target cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Infected cells were selected by incubation with 1 μg/ml puromycin. HEK293, HEK293T, and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method or Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) method. At the indicated times after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 2 mg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mg/ml aprotinin. The lysates were incubated with FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) or HA-agarose beads (Sigma) for 12 h at 4 °C, washed three times with lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). For immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, cell lysates were incubated with mouse polyclonal anti-XIAP antiserum or control mouse preimmune serum at 4 °C for 12 h. Protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the reaction for another 4 h of incubation, washed with lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After being blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were probed with a mouse or rabbit anti-human TRIM32 antiserum, anti-FLAG (Sigma), anti-β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-HA (Sigma), anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-ubiquitin (Calbiochem), anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-glutathione S-transferase (GST) (Amersham Biosciences), anti-cIAP-1 (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-cIAP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Bcl-xL (BD Pharmingen), anti-Bcl-2 (BD Pharmingen), anti-FLIP (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Mcl 1 (Cell Signaling Technology), or anti-XIAP (Cell Signaling Technology). Blots were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline containing Tween 20 and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse, anti-goat, or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G antibodies. The results were visualized through the use of a chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce). The caspase-3 activity of cell extracts (∼106 cells) was determined using the synthetic substrate, acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-methyl coumarin (DEVD-AMC; Peptron), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The AMC fluorescence released by active caspase-3 was measured at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. The results are expressed as -fold increase in the caspase activity of sample cells as compared with that from control vector-transfected cells. Annexin V, a specific reagent for phosphatidylserine, was used to stain the apoptotic cells. HEK293T cells were cultured on coverslips for 36 h, treated with 100 ng/ml TNFα, incubated for another 12 h, washed with PBS, and subsequently washed with a buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2). The samples were then stained with annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC; BD Pharmingen) diluted 1:40 in the same buffer for 15 min at room temperature, and washed with PBS. After fixation with 3.7% paraformaldehyde, the cells were observed under a fluorescence microscope. For assessment of nuclear fragmentation, Lipofectamine was used to transfect HeLa cells with the indicated constructs. The cells were incubated for 24 h and then treated with 50 ng/ml TNFα and 100 ng/ml cycloheximide. After 12 h, cells were fixed, permeabilized, stained with Hoechst dye (Sigma), and then observed under a fluorescence microscope. Cell viability was assessed as the ability to metabolize 1-(4,5-demethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Recombinant human E1 and E2 enzymes were prepared as described previously (34Kim J.H. Kim J. Kim D.H. Ryu G.H. Bae S.H. Seo Y.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 2287-2297Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), as was phosphorylated ubiquitin (35Tan P. Fuchs S.Y. Chen A. Wu K. Gomez C. Ronai Z. Pan Z.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 527-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A recombinant ubiquitin that could be phosphorylated by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase was constructed by inserting the nucleotide sequence encoding the kinase recognition motif, LRRASV (36Zetterqvist O. Ragnarsson U. Humble E. Berglund L. Engström L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 70: 696-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), in front of the second codon of the human ubiquitin sequence. The recombinant ubiquitin was Ni2+ affinity-purified and then phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (1 unit to 7 μg of substrate) in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 12 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 25 μm ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The autoubiquitination reaction mixtures (30 μl) contained 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm NaF, 10 nm okadaic acid, 2 mm ATP, 0.6 mm DTT, 5 μg of 32P-labeled ubiquitin, E1 enzyme (2 pmol), E2 enzyme (UbcH5A, UbcH5B, UbcH5C, or hCdc34; 10 pmol), and the purified His6-tagged TRIM32 protein (3 or 10 pmol). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min, the reaction was terminated with SDS sample buffer, and the samples were boiled for 3 min prior to SDS-PAGE. The polyubiquitin chains were analyzed by autoradiography. The target ubiquitination assay was carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions (Enzo Life Sciences) with a minor modification using GST-fused XIAP protein prepared from E. coli as a substrate. Purified GST-XIAP (100 nm) and His6-tagged TRIM32 protein (full-length or RING deletion mutant, 50 nm) were incubated in a reaction buffer including 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, and 2.5 μm biotinylated ubiquitin at 30 °C for 1 h. After the addition of E1 (100 nm) and E2 (UbcH6, 2.5 μm) enzymes, the reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for another 2 h. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by immunoblotting. Given that many TRIM proteins (e.g. TRIM11, TRIM19, TRIM27, TRIM35, TRIM39, and TRIM69) play roles in apoptosis (18Tuoc T.C. Stoykova A.

Cell Res. 2003; 287: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of TRIM32 overexpression on apoptosis. We generated an HEK293T cell line that stably overexpressed TRIM32 proteins at an ∼5-fold higher level than that seen in the vector control (Fig. 1A). TRIM32 overexpression alone did not appear to induce significant morphological changes (Fig. 1B, upper right panel). Within 12 h after treatment with TNFα, however, overexpressing cells became round, displayed membrane ruffling, and initiated detachment from the dish (all characteristics suggestive of apoptosis), whereas the control cell line stably harboring the empty plasmid was relatively unaffected by TNFα treatment (Fig. 1B, lower panels). Following TNFα treatment, TRIM32-overexpressing cells also showed markedly more annexin V-positive cells (Fig. 1B, lower right panel) and elevated caspase-3 activity (Fig. 1C) as compared with control cells, indicating increased apoptosis in the TRIM32-overexpressing cells. We thus conclude that TRIM32 expression sensitizes cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis. It has been well known that simultaneous activation of NFκB by TNFα induces the expression of anti-apoptotic genes (e.g. IAPs, FLIP, and Bcl-2) that inhibit the pro-apoptotic signaling activated by TNFα (42Chu Z.L.

Thus, the de novo protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, is often used in combination with TNFα to induce apoptosis. Based on our results, we speculated that TRIM32 may facilitate TNFα-induced apoptotic signaling by down-regulating the anti-apoptotic pathway. To confirm the role of TRIM32 in TNFα-induced apoptosis, we down-regulated TRIM32 expression by RNA interference-mediated silencing using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and examined caspase activity and cell morphology following treatment with TNFα and cycloheximide. Cells transfected with the TRIM32 shRNA construct showed ∼70% lower TRIM32 expression levels as compared with vector-treated controls (Fig. 2A, upper panel). This TRIM32 knockdown reduced the level of TNFα-induced caspase-3 activation, as assessed by a caspase-3 autocleavage assay (Fig. 2A, middle panel) and a DEVD-AMC cleavage assay (Fig. 2B), and decreased the extent of apoptotic morphology (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these findings suggest that TRIM32 is linked with TNFα-induced apoptotic signaling. To investigate which region of TRIM32 is required for its effect on TNFα-induced apoptosis, we constructed a series of TRIM32 deletion mutants (Fig. 3A). Transient transfection of vectors expressing full-length TRIM32 into HeLa cells followed by treatment with TNFα and cycloheximide for 12 h exacerbates representative apoptotic features, such as nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 3B). Transfection of vectors encoding RING finger-deleted TRIM32 did not affect this nuclear fragmentation (Fig. 3B), whereas transient transfection of vectors encoding B-box- or coiled-coil-deleted proteins had the same effect as transfection of full-length TRIM32 (data not shown). When these TRIM32 deletions were tested for their abilities to activate caspase-3 in HEK293 cells, as assessed by a caspase-3 autocleavage assay and a DEVD-AMC cleavage assay (Fig. 3C), we found that deletion of the RING finger consistently abolished the TRIM32-associated caspase-3 activation, whereas the other deletions had insignificant effects. In addition, cell viability measurement using an MTT assay confirmed that TRIM32 sensitizes cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis in a RING finger-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). TRIM32 has been considered as an E3 ubiquitin ligase due to the presence of the RING finger domain in its structure. In the present study, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay with purified recombinant TRIM32 protein. In agreement with a previous report (25Kudryashova E. Kudryashov D. Kramerova I. Spencer M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 354: 413-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), recombinant TRIM32 displayed autoubiquitination in the absence of substrate and in the presence of ATP, ubiquitin, the E1 enzyme, and E2 enzymes such as UbcH6 (see below), UbcH5a, and UbcH5c, but not Cdc34 (Fig. 4A). We found that UbcH5b also functioned as an E2 for TRIM32, although to a lesser extent than UbcH5a or UbcH5c under our experimental conditions (Fig. 4A, lanes 10 and 11). To test the in vivo relevance of the E3 ligase activity of TRIM32, we transfected HEK293 cells with vectors encoding full-length or RING finger-deleted TRIM32 and analyzed the autoubiquitination of TRIM32. Ubiquitin-conjugated high molecular mass TRIM32 complexes accumulated in lysates from cells transfected with vectors encoding full-length TRIM32, but not in lysates from cells expressing the RING finger deletion mutant (Fig. 4B, right panel) or the RING finger point mutant (C23A, data not shown). These findings indicate that TRIM32 has RING finger-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. Based on the above results, we speculated that TRIM32 may ubiquitinate an anti-apoptotic protein, targeting it for degradation and thereby facilitating TNFα-induced apoptosis. To examine this hypothesis further, we examined whether TRIM32 expression could down-regulate the expression levels of"
https://openalex.org/W1970011233,"Protein modifications of death receptor pathways play a central role in the regulation of apoptosis. It has been demonstrated that O-glycosylation of TRAIL-receptor (R) is essential for sensitivity and resistance towards TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. In this study we ask whether and how glycosylation of CD95 (Fas/APO-1), another death receptor, influences DISC formation and procaspase-8 activation at the CD95 DISC and thereby the onset of apoptosis. We concentrated on N-glycostructure since O-glycosylation of CD95 was not found. We applied different approaches to analyze the role of CD95 N-glycosylation on the signal transduction: in silico modeling of CD95 DISC, generation of CD95 glycosylation mutants (at N136 and N118), modulation of N-glycosylation by deoxymannojirimycin (DMM) and sialidase from Vibrio cholerae (VCN). We demonstrate that N-deglycosylation of CD95 does not block DISC formation and results only in the reduction of the procaspase-8 activation at the DISC. These findings are important for the better understanding of CD95 apoptosis regulation and reveal differences between apoptotic signaling pathways of the TRAIL and CD95 systems."
https://openalex.org/W2025447458,"IL-17C is a member of the IL-17 family of cytokines. The expression of IL-17C has been demonstrated to be strongly induced by TNFα in human keratinocytes, and recently the level of IL-17C was found to be increased in the inflammatory skin disease psoriasis. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of IL-17C. Here, we show that pretreatment of cultured human keratinocytes with the inhibitor of κB kinase 2 inhibitor, SC-514, resulted in a significant reduction in both IL-17C mRNA and protein expression, indicating the significance of this pathway in the regulation of IL-17C. NF-κB binding sites were identified upstream from the IL-17C gene, and by electrophoretic mobility shift assay NF-κB was shown to bind to all three identified binding sites. Moreover, NF-κB binding to these sites was inducible by TNFα. Supershift analysis revealed binding of the NF-κB subunits p65 and p50 to all three NF-κB binding sites. To determine the contribution of NF-κB in IL-17C expression, we conducted luciferase gene reporter experiments and demonstrated that a 3204-bp promoter fragment of IL-17C containing three putative NF-κB binding sites was strongly activated by TNFα. Interestingly, mutations of the three NF-κB binding sites revealed that one specific NF-κB binding site was crucial for the TNFα-mediated IL-17C induction because mutation of this specific site completely abolished TNFα-induced IL-17C promoter activation. We conclude that the activation of NF-κB (p65/p50) is crucial for the TNFα-induced stimulation of IL-17C expression in human keratinocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2067072627,"Kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are an emerging group of secreted serine proteases involved in several physiological and pathological processes. We used a degradomic approach to identify potential substrates of KLK12. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated either with KLK12 or vehicle control, and the proteome of the overlying medium was analyzed by mass spectrometry. CCN1 (cyr61, ctgf, nov) was among the proteins released by the KLK12-treated cells, suggesting that KLK12 might be responsible for the shedding of this protein from the cell surface. Fragmentation of CCN1 by KLK12 was further confirmed in vitro, and the main cleavage site was localized in the hinge region between the first and second half of the recombinant protein. KLK12 can target all six members of the CCN family at different proteolytic sites. Limited proteolysis of CCNs (cyr61, ctgf, nov) was also observed in the presence of other members of the KLK family, such as KLK1, KLK5, and KLK14, whereas KLK6, KLK11, and KLK13 were unable to fragment CCNs. Because KLK12 seems to have a role in angiogenesis, we investigated the relations between KLK12, CCNs, and several factors known to be involved in angiogenesis. Solid phase binding assays showed that fragmentation of CCN1 or CCN5 by KLK12 prevents VEGF(165) binding, whereas it also triggers the release of intact VEGF and BMP2 from the CCN complexes. The KLK12-mediated release of TGF-β1 and FGF-2, either as intact or truncated forms, was found to be concentration-dependent. These findings suggest that KLK12 may indirectly regulate the bioavailability and activity of several growth factors through processing of their CCN binding partners."

Twenty years ago elements of natural selection were adapted to in vitro selection in order to distinguish aptamers among randomized sequence libraries. The primary bottleneck in traditional aptamer discovery is multiple cycles of in vitro evolution. Methodology/Principal Findings We show that over-representation of sequences in aptamer libraries and deep sequencing enables acyclic identification of aptamers. We demonstrated this by isolating a known family of aptamers for human α-thrombin. Aptamers were found within a library containing an average of 56,000 copies of each possible randomized 15mer segment. The high affinity sequences were counted many times above the background in 2–6 million reads. Clustering analysis of sequences with more than 10 counts distinguished two sequence motifs with candidates at high abundance. Motif I contained the previously observed consensus 15mer, Thb1 (46,000 counts), and related variants with mostly G/T substitutions; secondary analysis showed that affinity for thrombin correlated with abundance (Kd = 12 nM for Thb1). The signal-to-noise ratio for this experiment was roughly 10,000∶1 for Thb1. Motif II was unrelated to Thb1 with the leading candidate (29,000 counts) being a novel aptamer against hexose sugars in the storage and elution buffers for Concanavilin A (Kd = 0.5 µM for α-methyl-mannoside); ConA was used to immobilize α-thrombin. Conclusions/Significance Over-representation together with deep sequencing can dramatically shorten the discovery process, distinguish aptamers having a wide range of affinity for the target, allow an exhaustive search of the sequence space within a simplified library, reduce the quantity of the target required, eliminate cycling artifacts, and should allow multiplexing of sequencing experiments and targets."
https://openalex.org/W1976362854,"When selecting a resource to exploit, an insect colony must take into account at least two constraints: the resource must be abundant enough to sustain the whole group, but not too large to limit exploitation costs, and risks of conflicts with other colonies. Following recent results on cockroaches and ants, we introduce here a behavioral mechanism that satisfies these two constraints. Individuals simply modulate their probability to switch to another resource as a function of the local density of conspecifics locally detected. As a result, the individuals gather at the smallest resource that can host the whole group, hence reducing competition and exploitation costs while fulfilling the overall group's needs. Our analysis reveals that the group becomes better at discriminating between similar resources as it grows in size. Also, the discrimination mechanism is flexible and the group readily switches to a better suited resource as it appears in the environment. The collective decision emerges through the self-organization of individuals, that is, in absence of any centralized control. It also requires a minimal individual cognitive investment, making the proposed mechanism likely to occur in other social species and suitable for the development of distributed decision making tools."
https://openalex.org/W2029588989,"Background Many strategies have been employed to increase the conformational stability of proteins. The use of 4-substituted proline analogs capable to induce pre-organization in target proteins is an attractive tool to deliver an additional conformational stability without perturbing the overall protein structure. Both, peptides and proteins containing 4-fluorinated proline derivatives can be stabilized by forcing the pyrrolidine ring in its favored puckering conformation. The fluorinated pyrrolidine rings of proline can preferably stabilize either a Cγ-exo or a Cγ-endo ring pucker in dependence of proline chirality (4R/4S) in a complex protein structure. To examine whether this rational strategy can be generally used for protein stabilization, we have chosen human ubiquitin as a model protein which contains three proline residues displaying Cγ-exo puckering. Methodology/Principal Findings While (2S,4R)-4-fluoroproline ((4R)-FPro) containing ubiquitinin can be expressed in related auxotrophic Escherichia coli strain, all attempts to incorporate (2S,4S)-4-fluoroproline ((4S)-FPro) failed. Our results indicate that (4R)-FPro is favoring the Cγ-exo conformation present in the wild type structure and stabilizes the protein structure due to a pre-organization effect. This was confirmed by thermal and guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation profile analyses, where we observed an increase in stability of −4.71 kJ·mol−1 in the case of (4R)-FPro containing ubiquitin ((4R)-FPro-ub) compared to wild type ubiquitin (wt-ub). Expectedly, activity assays revealed that (4R)-FPro-ub retained the full biological activity compared to wt-ub. Conclusions/Significance The results fully confirm the general applicability of incorporating fluoroproline derivatives for improving protein stability. In general, a rational design strategy that enforces the natural occurring proline puckering conformation can be used to stabilize the desired target protein."
https://openalex.org/W2053024016,"2-Hydroxylated fatty acid (HFA)-containing sphingolipids are abundant in mammalian skin and are believed to play a role in the formation of the epidermal barrier. Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H), required for the synthesis of 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids in various organs, is highly expressed in skin, and previous in vitro studies demonstrated its role in the synthesis of HFA sphingolipids in human keratinocytes. Unexpectedly, however, mice deficient in FA2H did not show significant changes in their epidermal HFA sphingolipids. Expression of FA2H in murine skin was restricted to the sebaceous glands, where it was required for synthesis of 2-hydroxylated glucosylceramide and a fraction of type II wax diesters. Absence of FA2H resulted in hyperproliferation of sebocytes and enlarged sebaceous glands during hair follicle morphogenesis and anagen (active growth phase) in adult mice. This was accompanied by a significant up-regulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor ligand epigen in sebocytes. Loss of FA2H significantly altered the composition and physicochemical properties of sebum, which often blocked the hair canal, apparently causing a delay in the hair fiber exit. Furthermore, mice lacking FA2H displayed a cycling alopecia with hair loss in telogen. These results underline the importance of the sebaceous glands and suggest a role of specific sebaceous gland or sebum lipids, synthesized by FA2H, in the hair follicle homeostasis. 2-Hydroxylated fatty acid (HFA)-containing sphingolipids are abundant in mammalian skin and are believed to play a role in the formation of the epidermal barrier.

These results underline the importance of the sebaceous glands and suggest a role of specific sebaceous gland or sebum lipids, synthesized by FA2H, in the hair follicle homeostasis. Hair in mammals is formed by the hair follicle, which undergoes repeated cycles of growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and resting phases (telogen) (for review see Ref. 1Schneider M.R. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Paus R. Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: R132-R142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar and references therein). During anagen, a new hair shaft is generated, followed by shedding of the old hair, possibly by an actively induced process called exogen (2Milner Y. Sudnik J. Filippi M. Kizoulis M. Kashgarian M.

Regeneration of the hair follicle in anagen depends on newly generated proliferating matrix cells at the base of the follicle, which are derived from stem cells in the bulge region, located in close proximity to the sebaceous gland (SG). 2The abbreviations used are: SGsebaceous glandEpgnepigenFA2Hfatty acid 2-hydroxylaseGlcCerglucosylceramideHFA2-hydroxylated fatty acidHFA-GlcCer2-hydroxylated glucosylceramideORSouter root sheathPPARγperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ. Various genetic defects can affect normal hair cycling, causing excessive hair growth or abnormal hair loss (see Ref. 1Schneider M.R. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Paus R. Curr.

The mammalian skin produces large amounts of different and in part skin-specific lipids. For example, ω-hydroxylated ceramides covalently bound to proteins in the cornified envelope are essential components of the water barrier of the skin (4Madison K.C. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 231-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). The major fraction of the noncovalently bound skin surface lipids is derived from the sebum produced by SG and released by holocrine secretion (5Smith K.R. Thiboutot D.M. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 271-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 6Schneider M.R. Paus R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 42: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In general, sebum is deposited on the hair inside the follicle and is brought up to the surface of the skin along the hair shaft. Sebum lubricates and protects the hair and skin and prevents drying and irritation of membranes. Sebum lipids possibly play a role in waterproofing, and antibacterial sebum lipids may inhibit infections of the skin (5Smith K.R. Thiboutot D.M. J. Lipid Res. 2008; 49: 271-281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Significant species-specific differences in the sebum composition exist, but their functional relevance is largely unknown (7Nikkari T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1974; 62: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Although the production of sebum is the only established role of SG, several studies suggest that they may also play a role in hair follicle homeostasis (8Zheng Y. Eilertsen K.J. Ge L. Zhang L.

Mammalian epidermis contains large amounts of ceramide, glucosylceramide, and sphingomyelin synthesized by differentiating keratinocytes (11Holleran W.M. Takagi Y. Uchida Y. FEBS. Lett. 2006; 580: 5456-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Most ceramides of the stratum corneum derive from glucosylceramide and sphingomyelin and are liberated from these precursors by extracellular hydrolysis. The transient “conversion” of free ceramides into other sphingolipids enables keratinocytes to produce large amounts of ceramides without increasing intracellular free ceramide concentration, which otherwise could affect various signaling pathways (11Holleran W.M. Takagi Y. Uchida Y. FEBS. Lett. 2006; 580: 5456-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In contrast to the established role of ceramide ω-hydroxylation (see above), much less is known about the function of other hydroxyl modifications found in skin sphingolipids, like 2-hydroxylation of the acyl residues and 4-hydroxylation of the sphingoid base. Mammalian skin contains relatively large amounts of 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids. In line with this, the only known enzyme catalyzing the 2-hydroxylation of unbranched fatty acids, fatty acid 2-hydroxylase (FA2H) (12Alderson N.L. Rembiesa B.M. Walla M.D. Bielawska A. Bielawski J.

J. 2005; 388: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Furthermore, differentiation-dependent up-regulation of Fa2h has been observed in human keratinocytes (15Uchida Y. Hama H. Alderson N.L. Douangpanya S. Wang Y. Crumrine D.A. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 13211-13219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting that FA2H is responsible for synthesis of 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids in keratinocytes of mammalian skin. To further explore the role of 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids, we have generated FA2H-deficient mice (16Zöller I. Meixner M. Hartmann D. Büssow H. Meyer R. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9741-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These mice lack all 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids in the central and peripheral nervous system. Nevertheless, normal compact myelin was formed in these mice. However, aged mice develop a late onset axon and myelin sheath degeneration (16Zöller I. Meixner M. Hartmann D. Büssow H. Meyer R. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9741-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that synthesis of most 2-hydroxylated sphingolipids in murine skin does not depend on Fa2h expression. In murine skin, Fa2h is only expressed in SG and not in keratinocytes. Absence of FA2H affected synthesis of 2-hydroxylated glucosylceramide and wax diesters in the SG and caused a delay in fur emergence, sebocyte hyperproliferation, and cyclic alopecia. FA2H-deficient mice were generated as described previously (16Zöller I. Meixner M. Hartmann D. Büssow H. Meyer R. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9741-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Genotyping was done by PCR on genomic mouse tail DNA using the oligonucleotides 5′-ATTCGCAGCGCATCGCCTTCTATC-3′, 5′-GTGCTGTACCTCAGCTGGTC-3′, and 5′-GCTCTTCTTCAAGAGCCATCC-3′ as primers, which amplified a 1045-bp fragment from the wild-type and a 685-bp fragment from the targeted allele. All animal experiments were approved by and carried out with permission from the Landesamt für Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany. An antiserum directed against mouse FA2H was generated by immunization of rabbits with the peptide CELRADPQDPTENGA linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin via the amino-terminal cysteine residue. The peptide sequence corresponds to amino acids 84–97 of the FA2H protein. The monospecific IgG fraction was isolated by affinity chromatography. Because FA2H-deficient mice have an insertion of a lacZ reporter gene in exon 3, mice express a fusion protein of the amino-terminal cytochrome b5 domain with β-galactosidase, which is also recognized by the FA2H antiserum. Specificity of the antiserum was tested by immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis using CHO cells transfected with an Fa2h expression plasmid (data not shown). Total RNA of murine skin was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Total RNA (20 μg/lane) was separated in 1 m formaldehyde, 1% agarose gels and transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences). A 568-bp fragment of the Fa2h cDNA (corresponding to exon 3 and 4) was used to synthesize a 32P-labeled probe by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP and Megaprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences), following the instructions of the manufacturer. A β-actin probe (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to control for equal loading. Hybridization was performed using standard procedures (17Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York2003Google Scholar). Radioactivity was detected by autoradiography on x-ray films. Digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes were transcribed from FA2H cDNA as described previously (13Eckhardt M. Yaghootfam A. Fewou S.N. Zöller I. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Hybridization of digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes to skin paraffin sections was done as described previously (18Fewou S.N. Büssow H.

Briefly, sections were hybridized overnight at 70 °C in 50% formamide, 1% Denhardt' solution, 0.2% SDS, 0.25 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm PIPES, and 10 mm EDTA. Sections were washed twice with 2× SSC at 60 °C for 5 and 30 min and once with 0.1× SSC for 45 min at 70 °C. Hybridized sections were equilibrated in maleic acid buffer (100 mm maleic acid, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) and incubated in maleic acid buffer containing 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h at room temperature. Bound RNA probes were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin Ig (Roche Diagnostics) at a dilution of 1:5,000 in maleic acid buffer containing 2% blocking reagent (Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C overnight in a humid chamber. Sections were washed with alkaline phosphatase buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5) and stained using 0.33 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.16 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in alkaline phosphatase buffer containing 2 mm levamisole to block endogenous alkaline phosphatase activity. Back skin samples were directly frozen in OCT Tissue-TeK as described by Paus et al. (19Paus R. Müller-Röver S. Van Der Veen C. Maurer M. Eichmüller S. Ling G. Hofmann U. Foitzik K. Mecklenburg L. Handjiski B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). Sections (8–10 μm) were cut in a cryostat and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Alternatively, skin samples were fixed overnight with 4% PFA in PBS at 4 °C and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 6 μm were placed on Superfrost Plus slides (Menzel-Gläser, Braunschweig, Germany) and dried overnight. After deparaffination in xylene and rehydration in an ethanol series, sections were either stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E staining) for histology or processed for 15 min in 10 mm sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0, in a microwave oven for antigen retrieval. Sections were slowly cooled down to room temperature, rinsed in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in TBS for 10 min. After blocking with 6% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TBS for 1 h, the sections were incubated with anti-Ki-67 antibody (DAKO Deutschland GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) (1:25) and the above-mentioned FA2H antiserum (1:800) or anti-CD34 antibody (Hycult® Biotech, Beutelsbach, Germany) (1:25) and the above-mentioned FA2H antiserum (1:800) overnight at 4 °C. After washing with TBS, Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit (1:500; The Jackson Laboratory) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat (1:200; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used to detect primary antibodies. All antibodies were diluted in 1% BSA in TBS. Nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Sigma), and the sections were embedded in polyvinyl alcohol mounting medium with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma). Images were captured with an Axiovert 100M fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) and analyzed with the Axiovision 4.5 program. SG size was quantified by morphometric measurements with the Axiovision 4.5 program. Mice were injected (intraperitoneally) with 10 μl of BrdU labeling reagent (100 mg/ml; BioGenex, San Ramon, CA)/g body weight, 2.5 h before they were sacrificed. Dorsal skin samples were fixed, embedded, and sectioned as described above. After deparaffination, the sections were placed in 2 n HCl for 30 min at 37 °C and subsequently rinsed thoroughly in PBS. This was followed by a 30-min treatment with 0.1% trypsin (Invitrogen) in PBS at 37 °C. After rinsing in PBS, the sections were covered with the monoclonal anti-BrdU antibody IIB5 (BioGenex) overnight at 4 °C. For detection with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, the Super SensitiveTM Link-Label IHC detection system (BioGenex) was used with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine as substrate. Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin for 30 s, dehydrated, and embedded in polyvinyl alcohol mounting medium with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (Sigma). RNA was prepared from back skin of postnatal day 10 wild-type (n = 2), Fa2h+/− (n = 3), and Fa2h−/− (n = 3) mice using TRIzol, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was further purified using RNeasy mini-columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was synthesized from 5 μg of total RNA using T7-oligo(dT) primers. Synthesis of biotin-labeled cRNA and cRNA fragmentation was done following the protocols from Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA). Ten μg of fragmented cRNA were hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays following the manufacturer's instructions. Microarray data were analyzed with ArrayAssist (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) using the GC-Robust Multiarray Averaging method for normalization. Skin total RNA was isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen), following the instructions of the manufacturer. cDNA was synthesized from skin total RNA (5 μg) using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers. Real time PCR was done using a Bio-Rad i-cycler (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Green ReadyMix (Sigma). Data were analyzed by the 2−ΔCt method, using ubiquitin C as the reference. Data are shown as means ± S.E. Data were tested for significance using two-tailed t test with a significance level of p < 0.05. All PCRs were done in duplicate, and at least three independent experiments using RNA preparations from three mice per genotype and age were performed.

Alternatively, epidermis was separated from dermis by 16–18 h of incubation on 1% trypsin in Hepes buffer, pH 7.4. Epidermis was removed and lyophilized. Lipids were isolated from dried epidermis, total skin, or auricles as described previously (20Doering T. Brade H. Sandhoff K. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1727-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Lipids were separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on Silica Gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck) using the solvent system chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (190:9:1, v/v) for ceramides or chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v) for hexosylceramides. Surface lipids, which are mostly derived from SG (7Nikkari T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1974; 62: 257-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), were extracted by dipping mice into 20–30 ml of acetone. The acetone extract was filtered through glass wool and dried under nitrogen. Total surface lipids were analyzed by TLC using the solvent system n-hexane/toluene (1:1, v/v) or chloroform/methanol/acetic acid (190:9:1, v/v). The following standards were used: cholesterol, oleyl oleate, triglycerides, and cholesterol ester (all from Sigma). Standard lipids were applied onto the same TLC plate as the samples and used to generate a standard curve. After scanning, lipids were quantified by densitometry with the Advanced Image data analyzer software (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany). Data were tested for significant differences using two-tailed Student's t test. Free extractable sphingolipids were analyzed with a triple quadrupole instrument (VG Micromass Model Quattro II, Cheshire, UK) equipped with a nano-electrospray source. Quantification was performed with internal standards for ceramides (Cer(d18:1,14:0), Cer(d18:1,19:0), Cer(d18:1,25:0), Cer(d18:1,31:0), and Cer(t18:0,31:0)) and glucosylceramides (GlcCer(d18:1,14:0), GlcCer(d18:1,19:0), GlcCer(d18:1,25:0), and Cer(d18:1,31:0)) according to Jennemann et al. (21Jennemann R. Sandhoff R. Langbein L. Kaden S. Rothermel U. Gallala H. Sandhoff K. Wiegandt H. Gröne H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3083-3094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After adding internal standards, samples were injected directly into the nano-electrospray ionization source of the mass spectrometer. Ceramides and glucosylceramides containing the major sphingoid base sphingosine (d18:1) were detected by precursor ion scanning with the fragment m/z +264 specific for long chain sphingoid base (d18:1) using a collision energy of 50 eV and a linear cone voltage ramp of 35 V at m/z 500 up to 65 V at m/z 1500. Sphingolipids with a fatty acid hydroxylation shifted in the mass spectra up by 16 Da and thus could be distinguished from sphingolipids with nonhydroxylated acyl moieties. Epidermal sphingolipids with acyl chains not longer than 26 carbon atoms have been reported to basically contain α-hydroxylations, whereas ultra long chain acyl moieties (>28 carbon atoms) released from O-acyl esters are published to be ω-hydroxylated in skin (22Ponec M. Weerheim A. Lankhorst P. Wertz P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2003; 120: 581-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 23Wertz P.W. Downing D.T. J.

Thus, we grouped α-hydroxy (C16–26) and ω-hydroxy (C30–36) compounds according to the length of the acyl moieties. Dorsal skin of 45–46-day-old Fa2h−/−, Fa2h+/− and wild-type male mice was depilated when hair follicles were in late catagen to early telogen phase of the hair cycle. Photographs were taken every day from the depilated mice, and the skin color was recorded. At 6, 10, and 20 days after depilation, mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and the depilated area of the back skin was prepared as described previously (19Paus R. Müller-Röver S. Van Der Veen C. Maurer M. Eichmüller S. Ling G. Hofmann U. Foitzik K. Mecklenburg L. Handjiski B. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 523-532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). One-half of the sample was homogenized in TRIzol for subsequent RNA isolation, and the other part was fixed in 4% PFA and embedded in paraffin, and sections (6 μm) were stained with H&E as described above. Surface lipids were extracted by dipping mice into acetone. The acetone extract was filtered through glass wool and dried under nitrogen. After evaporation, the lipids were taken up in a small volume of n-hexane and transferred into melting point capillaries. The solvent was allowed to evaporate at 37 °C overnight. The melting point was determined using a capillary-type melting point apparatus (Buchi model 535; Büchi Labortechnik AG, Flawil, Switzerland). The temperature when the melting process started and the temperature when the surface lipid mixture appeared liquid completely were determined. Mice were placed in a 425 × 265 × 150-mm plastic container containing water (temperature 35–37 °C) for 3 min and then placed on paper towels for 15 s to absorb excess water. The mice were then exposed to ambient temperature (20 °C), and their body weights were recorded for 55 min. Mice were killed with an overdose of anesthetics and perfused via the left ventricle with Sörensen phosphate buffer with 1% procaine followed by 6% glutaraldehyde in the same buffer. After postfixation in OsO4, samples were dehydrated in a graded series of ethanols and embedded in 1,2,3-propanetriol glycidyl ether or Spurr's medium. Semithin sections were cut at 1 μm and stained with toluidine blue/pyronin G for light microscopy, using a Nikon 90i photomicroscope for documentation. Blocks were then trimmed down to a surface of about a square millimeter and resectioned at 70 nm; sections then contrasted with lead citrate and uranyl acetate and photographed in either a Zeiss EM 910 TEM or a JEOL 7500F SE in STEM mode. Fa2h is strongly expressed in murine skin (13Eckhardt M. Yaghootfam A. Fewou S.N. Zöller I. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and its expression exhibits hair cycle-dependent changes in wild-type mice (Fig. 1A). Fa2h expression was significantly up-regulated during morphogenesis and anagen and down-regulated in telogen. To further explore the role of FA2H in skin, Fa2h−/− mice were generated by inserting a lacZ reporter gene into the Fa2h gene (Fig. 1B) (16Zöller I. Meixner M. Hartmann D. Büssow H. Meyer R. Gieselmann V. Eckhardt M. J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 9741-9754Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis of back skin RNA from wild-type, Fa2h+/−, and Fa2h−/− mice confirmed absence of the Fa2h mRNA in the latter, reduced expression in heterozygous mice (Fig. 1C), and expression of an mRNA of the expected size transcribed from the Fa2h-Cytb5-lacZ fusion gene (Fig. 1D). Absence of full-length Fa2h mRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR of total skin RNA (Fig. 1E). Exon 1- and 2-specific primers confirmed expression of the Fa2h-Cytb5-lacZ fusion gene in Fa2h−/− mice, which was significantly up-regulated between P8 and P10, in contrast to the Fa2h mRNA of wild-type mice (Fig. 1E). Newborn Fa2h−/− mice were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates up to an age of 4–5 days. The skin of Fa2h−/− mice at 5–7 days of age, however, often appeared more flaky compared with wild-type or heterozygous mice (data not shown). The first fur became visible at postnatal day 6 in wild-type and heterozygous mice. In contrast, Fa2h−/− littermates showed a delay in fur development by 2 days, and the first fur became visible at day P8 to P9 (Fig. 2A). Thereafter, hair growth proceeded normally, although the fur appeared more irregular in Fa2h−/− mice with an apparently lower hair density (Fig. 2B). The fur of young Fa2h−/− mice was in addition less soft and glossy, and the hair seemed to be covered with a film of white material, and chunks of different sizes were detectable on the skin and hair. Some Fa2h−/− mice exhibited significant hair loss of their back skin in the first telogen (data not shown). During subsequent hair cycles, however, all Fa2h−/− mice showed repeated loss of their back and ventral skin hair (Fig. 2C, and data not shown). According to the pink skin color of the areas showing hair loss, this apparently occurred in telogen. As hair loss appeared to proceed relatively slowly (within several days), the fact that only a fraction of 4-week-old Fa2h−/− mice exhibited severe alopecia in the first telogen may be explained by the short first telogen phase (1–2 days (25Fuchs E. Nature. 2007; 445: 834-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar)). The regeneration capacity of hair follicles was examined after inducing anagen by depilation of the back skin in 45–46-day-old male mice (with hair follicles in the late catagen to early telogen phase, as indicated by the pink color of the back skin before depilation). Emergence of the new fur was delayed by about 2–3 days in Fa2h−/− mice (range, 12–14 days after depilation in Fa2h−/− compared with 9–12 days in wild-type and heterozygous controls), resembling the delay in fur development during morphogenesis (Fig. 2D). According to histological analyses and the changes in skin color, anagen induction was unaffected in Fa2h−/− mice, suggesting that not a delay in the induction of hair growth but a retention of the hair fiber exit was responsible for delayed emergence of the fur. In contrast to wild-type mice, the follicle ostia of Fa2h−/− mice appeared dilated in the telogen and early anagen phase (Fig. 3, A and B). Analysis of cryosections (Fig. 3C) revealed that the dilated hair canals were filled with sebum, which was also stainable with oil red (data not shown). Analysis at higher resolution of semithin section by light and electron microscopy revealed that large “sebum plugs” appear to be liberated “en bloc” from the SG, whereby the cell membranes were often still discernible in cells that had already lost their nucleus, indicating that these sebum plugs were released before apoptosis during holocrine secretion was complete (Fig. 4, A–E). This might be explained by altered sebum composition in Fa2h−/− mice, causing a significant increase in the melting temperature (as shown below), or by an as yet unexplained impact of altered sebum composition on the process of holocrine secretion"
https://openalex.org/W2011313101,"The 26 S proteasome comprises two multisubunit subcomplexes as follows: 20 S proteasome and PA700/19 S regulatory particle. The cellular mechanisms by which these subcomplexes assemble into 26 S proteasome and the molecular determinants that govern the assembly process are poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate the nonequivalent roles of the C termini of six AAA subunits (Rpt1-Rpt6) of PA700 in 26 S proteasome assembly in mammalian cells. The C-terminal HbYX motif (where Hb is a hydrophobic residue, Y is tyrosine, and X is any amino acid) of each of two subunits, Rpt3 and Rpt5, but not that of a third subunit Rpt2, was essential for assembly of 26 S proteasome. The C termini of none of the three non-HbYX motif Rpt subunits were essential for cellular 26 S proteasome assembly, although deletion of the last three residues of Rpt6 destabilized the 20 S-PA700 interaction. Rpt subunits defective for assembly into 26 S proteasome due to C-terminal truncations were incorporated into intact PA700. Moreover, intact PA700 accumulated as an isolated subcomplex when cellular 20 S proteasome content was reduced by RNAi. These results indicate that 20 S proteasome is not an obligatory template for assembly of PA700. Collectively, these results identify specific structural elements of two Rpt subunits required for 26 S proteasome assembly, demonstrate that PA700 can be assembled independently of the 20 S proteasome, and suggest that intact PA700 is a direct intermediate in the cellular pathway of 26 S proteasome assembly."

Mammalian proteins SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) both possess SSDs required for feedback regulation of sterol-related genes and sterol synthetic rate. Although these two SSD proteins clearly sense sterols, the range of signals detected by this eukaryotic motif is not clear. The yeast HMG-CoA reductase isozyme Hmg2, like its mammalian counterpart, undergoes endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation that is subject to feedback control by the sterol pathway. The primary degradation signal for yeast Hmg2 degradation is the 20-carbon isoprene geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, rather than a sterol. Nevertheless, the Hmg2 protein possesses an SSD, leading us to test its role in feedback control of Hmg2 stability. We mutated highly conserved SSD residues of Hmg2 and evaluated regulated degradation. Our results indicated that the SSD was required for sterol pathway signals to stimulate Hmg2 ER-associated degradation and was employed for detection of both geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and a secondary oxysterol signal. Our data further indicate that the SSD allows a signal-dependent structural change in Hmg2 that promotes entry into the ER degradation pathway. Thus, the eukaryotic SSD is capable of significant plasticity in signal recognition or response. We propose that the harnessing of cellular quality control pathways to bring about feedback regulation of normal proteins is a unifying theme for the action of all SSDs.

We propose that the harnessing of cellular quality control pathways to bring about feedback regulation of normal proteins is a unifying theme for the action of all SSDs. The sterol pathway is the source of diverse and essential lipid molecules in all eukaryotes. These products include the iterated isoprenes produced early in the pathway and sterols, such as cholesterol, made in the later steps (see Fig. 1A). Feedback regulation of the sterol pathway is highly conserved and multifaceted (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4549) Google Scholar, 2Hampton R.Y.

The sensing of sterol pathway activity requires detection of lipid intermediates, including extremely insoluble molecules such as cholesterol itself. An understanding of the cellular mechanisms for detecting sterol pathway activity would be of great basic and biomedical utility. In the regulation of mammalian sterol pathway activity, a protein transmembrane region known as the sterol-sensing domain (SSD) 3The abbreviations used are: SSDsterol-sensing domainERendoplasmic reticulumERADendoplasmic reticulum-associated degradationHMGRHMG-CoA reductaseSREBPsterol regulatory element-binding proteinSCAPSREBP cleavage activating proteinINSIGinsulin-induced gene proteinHRDHMG-CoA reductase degradationFPPfarnesyl pyrophosphateGGPPgeranylgeranyl pyrophosphateNR1non-regulated mutant of Hmg2CHXcycloheximideLovalovastatinZAzaragozic acidRo48Ro48-8071QCquality controlDMSOdimethyl sulfoxide. is required for sterols to alter both the transcription of sterol-relevant genes and the stability of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (HMGR), one of the rate-determining enzymes of the sterol pathway (6Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The SSD is found in a variety of sterol-related proteins (7Kuwabara P.E. Labouesse M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Conserved residues are primarily found in the bilayer and juxtamembrane positions dispersed over five transmembrane regions. Although the structure of an SSD has yet to be determined, numerous studies indicate that the SSD mediates responses to specific sterol molecules, thus providing a means of communication between sterols and proteins that control aspects of sterol biology (8Ohgami N.

In mammals, the SSD is found in several proteins (7Kuwabara P.E. Labouesse M. Trends Genet. 2002; 18: 193-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Two are directly involved in control of the sterol synthesis pathway and have been studied extensively (6Goldstein J.L. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Brown M.S. Cell. 2006; 124: 35-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). The first is called SCAP (for SREBP cleavage-activating protein). SCAP is a multispanning membrane protein that allows cholesterol regulation of the SREBP transcription factor, which activates the transcription of sterol pathway enzymes and the LDL receptor. When sterols are low, SREBP activity is elevated to increase sterol production and uptake. SREBP activation occurs when the full-length, membrane-bound form undergoes SCAP-dependent vesicular trafficking from the ER to the Golgi where concomitant cleavage and activation occurs. The SCAP-dependent movement of SREBP to the Golgi is regulated by cholesterol. When cellular cholesterol is high, SCAP binds cholesterol, which in turn allows binding to the ER-localized protein INSIG, causing ER retention of SCAP and its associated, unprocessed SREBP (11Yang T. Espenshade P.J. Wright M.E. Yabe D. Gong Y. Aebersold R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 2002; 110: 489-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Sterol-dependent retention of SCAP prohibits SREBP trafficking and activation so that the SCAP SSD mediates cholesterol-dependent inhibition of SREBP activity (12Yabe D. Xia Z.P. Adams C.M. Rawson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although the SSD has been proposed to mediate sterol recognition, it has recently been shown that a lumenal loop directly preceding the SSD directly binds cholesterol with a nm affinity constant (10Radhakrishnan A.

Thus, the role of the SSD in detection of and response to pathway signals is an important, and still open, question. The second SSD protein directly involved in cholesterol synthesis is HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR), a rate-limiting enzyme of sterol synthesis (see Fig. 1A). HMGR levels are directly regulated by feedback regulation of its stability (1Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Nature. 1990; 343: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (4549) Google Scholar). When sterol synthesis is high, HMGR undergoes rapid ubiquitin-dependent degradation; when sterol synthesis is low, HMGR degradation slows, allowing levels of HMGR to increase. Regulated degradation of mammalian HMGR is mediated by the SSD located in the N-terminal, multispanning membrane domain (12Yabe D. Xia Z.P. Adams C.M. Rawson R.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16672-16677Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 13Gil G. Faust J.R. Chin D.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Cell. 1985; 41: 249-258Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The SSD allows sterol-dependent binding of INSIG, which promotes proximity of the ER ubiquitin ligase gp78 to HMGR and the ubiquitination of the enzyme (14Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Importantly, the response mediated by the HMGR SSD is specific for a derivative of the early pathway intermediate lanosterol, thus ensuring that HMGR degradation is keyed to synthesis of sterols rather than levels of sterols (15Song B.L. Javitt N.B. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Cell Metab. 2005; 1: 179-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 16Nguyen A.D. McDonald J.G. Bruick R.K. DeBose-Boyd R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27436-27446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In both cases, the binding of INSIG is a key aspect of SSD function. The work below indicates that the SSD has a direct role in response to sterol pathway signals, independent of INSIG action. Regulated ubiquitination of HMGR was initially discovered in yeast; the Hmg2 isozyme of HMGR undergoes feedback-regulated ubiquitination that in turn leads to proteasomal degradation when sterol pathway activity is high (2Hampton R.Y. Garza R.M. Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Hampton R.Y. Rine J. J.

Hmg2 ubiquitination is executed by the Hmg CoA reductase degradation (HRD) pathway, using the ER-localized Hrd1 ubiquitin ligase, of which gp78 is a mammalian homologue (19Hampton R.Y. Gardner R.G. Rine J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 2029-2044Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 20Bays N.W. Gardner R.G. Seelig L.P. Joazeiro C.A. Hampton R.Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Degradation of Hmg2 is keyed to the levels of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), an early 15-carbon isoprene of the sterol pathway (see Fig. 1A); when levels of FPP are high, Hmg2 degradation rate is high, and when FPP levels are low, Hmg2 degradation rate is low (21Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our more recent work has shown that geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which is structurally analogous to FPP but with 20 carbons, is the likely bona fide signal (see Fig. 1) (22Garza R.M. Tran P.N. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35368-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In addition, we have shown that an oxysterol signal appears to modulate the degradation of Hmg2 as well; increased levels of certain oxysterols enhance the degradation rate controlled by endogenous levels of the FPP-derived signal (23Gardner R.G. Shan H. Matsuda S.P. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8681-8694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The overriding theme is that when sterol pathway signals are high, Hmg2 is more prone to enter the HRD degradation pathway and undergo degradation. The HRD pathway participates in ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and is required for protein quality control, promoting the degradation of a large variety of misfolded or misassembled ER-localized proteins. However, only Hmg2 undergoes sterol pathway-dependent changes in HRD-dependent degradation. We posited that regulation of HRD-dependent degradation was brought about by the FPP-derived signal causing Hmg2 to adopt features of a misfolded quality control substrate, presumably by direct interaction (24Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 188-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This model is bolstered by in vivo and in vitro limited proteolysis studies, indicating that Hmg2 undergoes the expected structural alterations when exposed to chemical chaperones or isoprenes related to FPP (25Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the physiological, FPP-derived degradation signal can promote regulated Hmg2 misfolding and can cause regulated destruction by the HRD quality control pathway. We wanted to explore the features of Hmg2 that underlie sensing of sterol pathway molecules required for pathway-regulated degradation. The SSD has been implicated in the response to sterols in a variety of studies. However, other SSD proteins may be regulated by lipids distinct from canonical sterols (26Dobrosotskaya I.Y. Seegmiller A.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Rawson R.B. Science. 2002; 296: 879-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we wondered to what extent the highly conserved SSD is involved in regulated degradation of Hmg2 caused by the non-sterol FPP-derived signal. We generated a collection of mutants in which highly conserved residues (usually one in each mutant) were converted to alanine, or in some cases to hydrophobic residues, and evaluated the regulated degradation of each mutant. Because the Hmg2 molecule is “structurally poised” to enter the HRD quality control pathway (24Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 188-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 25Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we paid close attention to the possibility that mutations of the highly conserved SSD residues might simply damage the Hmg2 structure and destabilize it in a manner not directly relevant to regulation. Surprisingly, we found only stabilizing mutations that decreased HRD-dependent Hmg2 degradation. In some cases, single SSD point mutations rendered Hmg2 completely stable. Furthermore, a subset of the SSD mutants specifically altered the response of Hmg2 degradation rate to oxysterols, whereas preserving the response to the main FPP-derived signal. Thus, our data indicate that the SSD allows response to diverse lipid signals, and perhaps, multiple ones in the same protein. Furthermore, the results allow the intriguing idea that the SSD imparts programmed misfolding as an ancient tactic of protein regulation that occurred before the divergence of mammals and yeast. Importantly, the actions of both the FPP-derived signal and the oxysterol that augments Hmg2 response to FPP operate independently of the yeast INSIG proteins. Thus, the studies below indicate a direct role for the SSD in response to sterol pathway signals that control Hmg2 ERAD.

Briefly, Primers A and B and Primers C and D were used in separate PCR reactions to create separate, overlapping fragments containing the mutation. In a second round of PCR, the two fragments were combined with Primers A (oRH2192) and D (oRH2202) to create a single long fragment. This fragment was cut with MscI/SpeI and inserted in pRH1581 cut with the same enzymes. Wild-type and mutant plasmids were cut with StuI to integrate at ura3-52 in RHY519.

The SSD of Hmg2 has a number of highly conserved residues that appear in many or all SSDs (Figs. 1B and 7, supplemental Fig. S1). To better understand the Hmg2 SSD, we mutated highly conserved residues (usually to alanine) along the span of the domain, producing over 30 mutants in this manner (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 7, supplemental Fig. S1). We included mutations reported to function in mammalian SSD proteins, including the YIYF to AAAA mutant that rendered mammalian HMGR insensitive to regulated degradation (14Sever N. Song B.L. Yabe D.

Chem. 2003; 278: 52479-52490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and three mutants, Y298C, L315F, and D428A, that make mammalian SCAP insensitive to sterols (11Yang T.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 3242-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Each Hmg2 SSD mutant was then tested for regulated degradation. In earlier studies of Hmg2 (28Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5994-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), we found that scrambling a five-amino acid region, TFYSA (amino acids 348–352), brought about constitutive degradation that was unresponsive to the FPP-derived signal (25Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Several of the residues altered in this NR1 (for non-responsive) mutant are highly conserved between SSDs (Fig. 1, supplemental Fig. S1), suggesting a role for the SSD in regulation. However, the behavior of NR1 brings up an important caveat that informed the studies below. Hmg2 enters the HRD ERAD pathway when FPP-derived signals are elevated, causing structural changes that trigger quality control degradation (2Hampton R.Y. Garza R.M. Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) However, numerous mutants of Hmg2 show constitutive, unregulated entry into the HRD pathway by virtue of their aberrant structure, ranging from subtle to gross alterations (28Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5994-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). NR1 appears to adopt a normal structure by limited proteolysis (25Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar); however, it could also be that NR1 mutant has structural aberrations leading to unregulated degradation. In our analysis of the SSD mutants, this possibility was an important one to consider in understanding the effects of the SSD alterations. Altering the sequence of Hmg2 can result in three possible extremes of regulatory behavior. A mutant could behave as wild type, responding to changes in FPP levels such that higher FPP levels cause faster degradation. Alternatively, an Hmg2 mutant could undergo constitutive degradation with no response to alterations in FPP, as is the case for NR1. Finally, a mutant Hmg2 could be completely stable and show no response to FPP. Our studies of Hmg2 have provided examples of all three classes of mutants, as shown in Fig. 2. To evaluate Hmg2-regulated degradation, we used a flow cytometry method (22Garza R.M. Tran P.N. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35368-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) that allows quantitative, reproducible in vivo analyses (31Cronin S.R. Hampton R.Y. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 302: 58-73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We analyzed each SSD variant in the context of the GFP fusion Hmg2-GFP, which has the catalytic C terminus replaced with GFP (2Hampton R.Y. Garza R.M. Chem. Rev. 2009; 109: 1561-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In addition, a Myc tag was included in the first lumenal domain prior to the SSD, in a position that does not affect regulation (25Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 9). Each Hmg2-GFP mutant was expressed in strains with identical, high flux through the mevalonate pathway provided by a separately expressed Hmg2 catalytic domain. To examine degradation, we treated a strain with CHX and observed the time-dependent shift to lower cellular fluorescence caused by degradation. To examine regulation, the cells were treated with either HMGR inhibitor Lova to block production of FPP or ZA to cause a buildup of FPP by inhibition of squalene synthase, the enzyme that uses FPP as a substrate (Fig. 1A) (28Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5994-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Examples of the three extreme regulatory phenotypes (wild type, always degraded, and always stable) described above are demonstrated by flow cytometry in Fig. 2. The effects of CHX on cellular GFP fluorescence are shown in Fig. 2, top row. The effects of lowering FPP with Lova or raising FPP with ZA are shown in the bottom row, in which the steady-state fluorescence of treated and untreated cultures are overlaid. In the wild-type strain, CHX caused the expected time-dependent shift in population fluorescence due to degradation (top, left). Altering the sterol pathway changes cellular fluorescence in the expected ways; lowering FPP with Lova stabilized Hmg2-GFP, increasing its steady state, and increasing FPP with ZA caused increased Hmg2-GFP degradation, lowering steady-state fluorescence (bottom, left) (21Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31671-31678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Garza R.M. Tran P.N. Hampton R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35368-35380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). NR1 showed degradation (top, middle) but was unregulated, with no effect of either sterol pathway drug on steady-state levels (bottom, middle). The highly stable K6R point mutant of Hmg2-GFP shows high steady-state fluorescence and no degradation after CHX treatment (top, right). Again, the drugs that alter the sterol pathway did not alter the steady-state level (bottom, right), but in this case, this is because the K6R mutant is always stable at all levels of FPP. We used these assays to evaluate the role of the SSD in Hmg2-GFP regulated degradation. The SSD mutant phenotypes fell into three classes: wild type, partially stable, and completely stable. The phenotypes of each variant within a group were sufficiently similar that we show data for a few examples in each group and list all in the relevant figure. Members of the first group were comparable to wild type in their degradation rate and response to altering FPP with Lova or ZA (Fig. 3, data not shown). The second group showed partial stability indicated by slightly slower degradation with CHX and a blunted response to Lova (Fig. 4). For example, the D342A mutant showed a slightly higher steady-state level in untreated cells and a similar shift caused by CHX (top left panel). This would be consistent with the mutant being less responsive to the ambient levels of FPP in the cells. Lowering the levels of FPP with Lova had little effect, whereas increasing FPP with ZA stimulated degradation that was not as great as that in wild type, also consistent with a blunted response to the FPP-derived degradation signal (top right panel). Members of the third group were extremely stable (Fig. 5), phenocopying the K6R mutant above (Fig. 2). The addition of CHX essentially caused almost no leftward shift. The effects of Lova were either absent due to the protein being completely stable or very small due to slight increases in the already stable construct, such as seen with F349L/Y350A (Fig. 5, bottom right panel). Increasing the degradation signal with ZA did not cause degradation of these versions of Hmg2 (Fig. 8A, data not shown). The affected residues in the FY349LA (F349L/Y350A) mutant are part of the TFYSA cluster in the unregulated, constitutively degraded NR1 mutant (28Gardner R.G. Hampton R.Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5994-6004Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In contrast, conversion of Hmg2 to the less extreme F349L/Y350A mutant resulted in high stability and no response to FPP signal, rather than slow degradation with no response to FPP as in the more extreme NR1 mutant.FIGURE 8Analysis of a stable mutant, S215A.

https://openalex.org/W1967496490,"The family of angiotensin peptides has been steadily growing in recent years. Most are fragments of angiotensin II (Ang II) with different affinities to the known angiotensin receptors. Here, we describe a novel endogenous Ang II-like octapeptide in plasma from healthy humans and patients with end-stage renal failure, which acts as a stronger agonist at Mas receptors than Ang 1-7. Chromatographic purification and structural analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) revealed an Ang II-like octapeptide, angioprotectin, with the sequence Pro-Glu-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe, which differs from Ang II in Pro¹ and Glu² instead of Asp¹ and Arg². Pro-Glu-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe in angioprotectin is most likely generated enzymatically from Ang II. Angioprotectin antagonized the contractile actions of Ang II on rat aortic rings. The physiological antagonism of vasoconstrictor actions of Ang II by angioprotectin is mediated by the Mas receptor. Angioprotectin has a stronger affinity to the Mas receptor than Ang-1-7. Plasma concentrations were ~15% of plasma Ang II concentrations in healthy volunteers and up to 50% in patients with renal failure. A commercially available Ang II antibody did not discriminate between angioprotectin and Ang II; thus, angioprotectin can contribute to Ang II concentrations measured by antibody-based assays. This novel peptide is likely to be a relevant component of the human renin-angiotensin-system."
https://openalex.org/W2094431130,"The pathology of many of the world's most important infectious diseases is caused by the immune response. Additionally age-related disease is often attributed to inflammatory responses. Consequently a reduction in infections and hence inflammation early in life has been hypothesized to explain the rise in lifespan in industrialized societies. Here we demonstrate experimentally for the first time that eliciting an immune response early in life accelerates ageing. We use the beetle Tenebrio molitor as an inflammation model. We provide a proof of principle for the effects of early infection on morbidity late in life and demonstrate a long-lasting cost of immunopathology. Along with presenting a proof-of-principle study, we discuss a mechanism for the apparently counter-adaptive persistence of immunopathology in natural populations. If immunopathology from early immune response only becomes costly later in life, natural selection on reducing self-harm would be relaxed, which could explain the presence of immune self-harm in nature."

IntroductionThe C17orf37 gene is located in the minus strand of human chromosome 17q12 bounded by the ERBB2 and Grb7 genes. Several studies have reported that a 280-kb minimal region of 17q12 that contains ERBB2 and C17orf37 is frequently amplified in breast and colon cancer (1Kauraniemi P. Kallioniemi A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Maqani N. Belkhiri A. Moskaluk C. Knuutila S. Dar A.A. El-Rifai W. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). C17orf37 expression positively correlates with the grade and stage of breast cancer compared with minimal expression in normal tissues and thus is proposed to be a novel tumor biomarker (3Evans E.E. Henn A.D. Jonason A. Paris M.J. Schiffhauer L.M. Borrello M.A. Smith E.S. Sahasrabudhe D.M. Zauderer M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2919-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In patients with metastatic breast cancer, aberrant expression of C17orf37 has been observed in distant metastatic sites such as lungs and liver, suggesting a possible role of C17orf37 protein in metastatic dissemination of cancer cells (3Evans E.E. Henn A.D. Jonason A. Paris M.J. Schiffhauer L.M. Borrello M.A. Smith E.S. Sahasrabudhe D.M. Zauderer M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2919-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In prostate cancer, C17orf37 is overexpressed in the higher grades of prostate adenocarcinoma compared with low expression in normal or benign prostatic tissues (4Dasgupta S. Wasson L.M. Rauniyar N. Prokai L. Borejdo J. Vishwanatha J.K. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, expression of C17orf37 is minimal in 38 different normal tissues examined (3Evans E.E. Henn A.D. Jonason A. Paris M.J. Schiffhauer L.M. Borrello M.A. Smith E.S. Sahasrabudhe D.M. Zauderer M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2919-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting C17orf37 as a cancer-specific protein. Although C17orf37 overexpression is linked to genomic amplification of ERBB2 locus (1Kauraniemi P. Kallioniemi A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Kauraniemi P. Kuukasjärvi T. Sauter G. Kallioniemi A. Am. J.

Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) tumors suggests that C17orf37 has an independent functional promoter. C17orf37 gene encodes a 12-kDa protein that does not have sequence similarity with any known protein. C17orf37 is expressed as a cytosolic protein with predominant membrane localization, and we have previously demonstrated that C17orf37 acts as a signaling molecule channeling signaling through PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby transcriptionally up-regulating NF-κB downstream target genes MMP-9, uPA, 3The abbreviations used are: uPAurokinase-type plasminogen activatorGGTase-Igeranylgeranyltransferase-IFTasefarnesyltransferaseMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastGGPPgeranylgeranyl diphosphateTIRFtotal internal reflection fluorescentMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidGGTIGGTase-I inhibitorFTIFTase inhibitorFPPfarnesyl pyrophosphate. and VEGF (4Dasgupta S. Wasson L.M. Rauniyar N. Prokai L. Borejdo J. Vishwanatha J.K. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).An interesting feature of C17orf37 is the presence of a consensus sequence for prenylation comprising of the last four amino acids, CVIL, at the C-terminal end. Prenylated proteins belong to the CAAX family of proteins, which are post-translationally modified by the addition of isoprenyl groups. Prenylated proteins are modified at the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif by either farnesylation (addition of 15 carbon chain by protein farnesyltransferase enzyme (or FTase)) (7Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar) or geranylgeranylation with a 20-carbon chain by GGTase-I (8Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The C-terminal amino acid (X) of the CAAX motif determines which isoprenoid group is to be added to the candidate protein. If the amino acid X is leucine, the protein is predicted to be geranylgeranylated (7Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Hence, C17orf37 is predicted to be geranylgeranylated by GGTase-I at Cys-112. After the isoprenyl group is added, the modified protein undergoes two additional postprenylation processing steps, which include cleavage of the last three C-terminal amino acids by an endoprotease enzyme named Rce1 (Ras-converting enzyme 1) and finally methylation of the prenylated-cysteine by Icmt (isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferase) enzyme. These final modifications are also thought to be important for correct subcellular localization and biological activities of these proteins (9Cushman I. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27964-27973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The addition of the isoprenyl tail facilitates binding to the cellular membranes and protein-protein interaction and increases the stability of the protein, thereby regulating the overall functional property of these proteins (7Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Several oncogenes that undergo prenylation processing are known to promote cancer progression by activating proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, and inhibiting prenylation of these proteins reduces their functional activity (10Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Hence, enzymes involved in the prenylation processing are attractive targets for cancer therapy (10Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 11Konstantinopoulos P.A. Karamouzis M.V. Papavassiliou A.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).We investigated the importance of C-terminal isoprenylation of C17orf37 protein with respect to its function. We show for the first time that C17orf37 is geranylgeranylated by GGTase-I and also undergoes postprenylation processing, and these modifications are important for correct localization of the C17orf37 protein. We also show that membrane-associated C17orf37 increases cellular migration by inducing increased filopodia formation at the leading edge of the migrating cell, whereas prenylation-deficient mutant C17orf37 failed to do so. We further confirm that ectopic expression of C17orf37 modulates the dissemination of cancer cells and facilitates formation of metastatic nodules in a mouse model of metastasis. Our data clearly indicate that C17orf37 prenylation is sufficient to drive cellular migration and colonization of injected nontransformed fibroblast cells to distant organs compared with the inactive mutant C17orf37 protein. These findings directly establish role for C17orf37 in the migration and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells and further elucidates the importance of isoprenyl modification in the function of C17orf37.DISCUSSIONInformation concerning the importance of the novel gene C17orf37 in cancer biology is still emerging. Prompted by the finding that the gene is located in an important amplicon of chromosome 17q12 known as the “hot spot locus of cancer,” previous studies identified C17orf37 to be overexpressed in breast, colon, and prostate cancer (1Kauraniemi P. Kallioniemi A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Maqani N. Belkhiri A. Moskaluk C. Knuutila S. Dar A.A. El-Rifai W. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 4Dasgupta S. Wasson L.M. Rauniyar N. Prokai L. Borejdo J. Vishwanatha J.K. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and postulated that it could play an important role in cancer. In an attempt to understand the post-translational modifications of C17orf37 that may regulate its function, we identified a consensus prenylation motif CVIL at the C-terminal end. Both in vitro and in vivo prenylation assays confirmed C17orf37 is a substrate for the GGTase-I enzyme that catalyzes addition of 20-carbon isoprenyl group to the cysteine residue of CVIL motif (Fig. 1). Pharmacologic inhibition of GGTase-I and genetic inhibition of Icmt and Rce1 enzymes revealed that post-translational modifications are required for membrane association of C17orf37 protein (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). When this paper was under revision, Katz et al. (41Katz E. Dubois-Marshall S. Sims A.H. Faratian D. Li J. Smith E.S. Quinn J.A. Edward M. Meehan R.R. Evans E.E. Langdon S.P. Harrison D.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2010; 103: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) identified another motif at the N terminus of C17orf37 protein called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, which is cross-phosphorylated at two tyrosine residues, and they show that phosphorylation is important for C17orf37 function. Therefore, it is quite evident that post-translational modification codes regulate the activity and stability of C17orf37 protein.Functionally, C17orf37 protein enhances the migratory and invasive ability of prostate cancer cells. Mutation of the Cys residue that is the site of prenylation (C112S) results in a protein that fails to be modified by GGTase-I and is functionally inactive (Fig. 5). Through both in vitro and in vivo studies, we find that prenylated C17orf37 enhances the migratory and metastatic ability of tumor cells to increase their colonization to distant organs, whereas a prenylation-defective mutant of C17orf37 fails to do so (Fig. 7). Because prenylated C17orf37 promotes migratory ability not proliferation of cells, its role may be restricted to the intravasation and extravasation steps of tumor metastasis.In a migrating cancer cell, C17orf37 preferentially localizes to the leading edge of the cell (4Dasgupta S. Wasson L.M. Rauniyar N. Prokai L. Borejdo J. Vishwanatha J.K. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which is comprised of protrusive structures formed by polymerization of actin cytoskeleton. Mechanistic studies reveal that prenylated C17orf37 modulates filopodia formation and facilitates directional migration of cancer cells (Fig. 6). Filopodia formation is a tightly regulated process mediated by cortical actin polymerization in response to stimuli. Several proteins have been identified to mediate the assembly and disassembly of actin, which includes small GTPases like Rho family of proteins, Rac1, and Arp2/3 (actin-related protein) (38Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of these proteins are post-translationally modified by isoprenyl group addition important for protein-protein interaction and GTP loading. Although C17orf37 protein does not have a canonical GTP-binding site, it will be important to identify how C17orf37 protein induces filopodia formation. Because it is known that C17orf37 can act as a signaling molecule through the PI3K/Akt axis and activate NF-κB downstream genes MMP-9, uPA, and VEGF, it will be interesting to find whether C17orf37-induced filopodium formation is a direct effect mediated by the Akt pathway or by other regulatory processes engaged by C17orf37.Membrane is a vast dynamic structure composed of different classes of lipids. Our studies indicate that a majority of the prenylated C17orf37 protein localize to the membrane low in cholesterol composition (30Mayor S. Rao M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), whereas the mutant C17orf37 accumulates in the cytosol. Recently, there has been a great debate in the field to better understand the raft and nonraft lipid compositions and re-evaluate our understanding of the membrane microdomains (42Shaikh S.R. Edidin M.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 144: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that rafts are enriched in cholesterol and glycophosphatidylinositol (34van Meer G. Science. 2002; 296: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the lipid composition of non-cholesterol-rich membrane fraction is poorly understood (42Shaikh S.R. Edidin M.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 144: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Studies in prostate cancer cells have that revealed protein kinase B/Akt located in different compartments of plasma membrane (5Cinar B. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Meng G. Freeman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29584-29593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) regulates distinctive downstream signaling pathways. Our studies indicate that prenylated C17orf37 localizes outside the raft region (Fig. 4), and further studies are required to identify interactors of C17orf37 and lipid composition that favor its binding to the plasma membrane.Collectively, the findings of the present study broaden our understanding regarding the importance of C17orf37 in metastatic progression of cancer and the implications of post-translational isoprenylation on the functional activity of the protein. The present data also indicate that membrane association of C17orf37 is dependent on its post-translational modification at the C-terminal prenylation domain, which facilitates cellular migration by inducing filopodia formation and subsequent dissemination of cancer cells to distant organs. Because metastasis of cancer cells increases the mortality rate of human carcinomas, it is plausible that therapeutic strategies targeting C17orf37 may prove to be clinically useful to impede metastasis. IntroductionThe C17orf37 gene is located in the minus strand of human chromosome 17q12 bounded by the ERBB2 and Grb7 genes. Several studies have reported that a 280-kb minimal region of 17q12 that contains ERBB2 and C17orf37 is frequently amplified in breast and colon cancer (1Kauraniemi P. Kallioniemi A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Maqani N. Belkhiri A. Moskaluk C. Knuutila S. Dar A.A. El-Rifai W. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). C17orf37 expression positively correlates with the grade and stage of breast cancer compared with minimal expression in normal tissues and thus is proposed to be a novel tumor biomarker (3Evans E.E. Henn A.D. Jonason A. Paris M.J. Schiffhauer L.M. Borrello M.A. Smith E.S. Sahasrabudhe D.M. Zauderer M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2919-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In patients with metastatic breast cancer, aberrant expression of C17orf37 has been observed in distant metastatic sites such as lungs and liver, suggesting a possible role of C17orf37 protein in metastatic dissemination of cancer cells (3Evans E.E. Henn A.D. Jonason A. Paris M.J. Schiffhauer L.M. Borrello M.A. Smith E.S. Sahasrabudhe D.M. Zauderer M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2919-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In prostate cancer, C17orf37 is overexpressed in the higher grades of prostate adenocarcinoma compared with low expression in normal or benign prostatic tissues (4Dasgupta S. Wasson L.M. Rauniyar N. Prokai L. Borejdo J. Vishwanatha J.K. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, expression of C17orf37 is minimal in 38 different normal tissues examined (3Evans E.E. Henn A.D. Jonason A. Paris M.J. Schiffhauer L.M. Borrello M.A. Smith E.S. Sahasrabudhe D.M. Zauderer M. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2006; 5: 2919-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting C17orf37 as a cancer-specific protein. Although C17orf37 overexpression is linked to genomic amplification of ERBB2 locus (1Kauraniemi P. Kallioniemi A. Endocr. Relat.

C17orf37 gene encodes a 12-kDa protein that does not have sequence similarity with any known protein. C17orf37 is expressed as a cytosolic protein with predominant membrane localization, and we have previously demonstrated that C17orf37 acts as a signaling molecule channeling signaling through PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby transcriptionally up-regulating NF-κB downstream target genes MMP-9, uPA, 3The abbreviations used are: uPAurokinase-type plasminogen activatorGGTase-Igeranylgeranyltransferase-IFTasefarnesyltransferaseMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastGGPPgeranylgeranyl diphosphateTIRFtotal internal reflection fluorescentMES2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidGGTIGGTase-I inhibitorFTIFTase inhibitorFPPfarnesyl pyrophosphate. and VEGF (4Dasgupta S.

Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar).An interesting feature of C17orf37 is the presence of a consensus sequence for prenylation comprising of the last four amino acids, CVIL, at the C-terminal end. Prenylated proteins belong to the CAAX family of proteins, which are post-translationally modified by the addition of isoprenyl groups. Prenylated proteins are modified at the cysteine residue of the CAAX motif by either farnesylation (addition of 15 carbon chain by protein farnesyltransferase enzyme (or FTase)) (7Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar) or geranylgeranylation with a 20-carbon chain by GGTase-I (8Casey P.J. Seabra M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5289-5292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). The C-terminal amino acid (X) of the CAAX motif determines which isoprenoid group is to be added to the candidate protein. If the amino acid X is leucine, the protein is predicted to be geranylgeranylated (7Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Hence, C17orf37 is predicted to be geranylgeranylated by GGTase-I at Cys-112. After the isoprenyl group is added, the modified protein undergoes two additional postprenylation processing steps, which include cleavage of the last three C-terminal amino acids by an endoprotease enzyme named Rce1 (Ras-converting enzyme 1) and finally methylation of the prenylated-cysteine by Icmt (isoprenylcysteine-O-carboxyl methyltransferase) enzyme. These final modifications are also thought to be important for correct subcellular localization and biological activities of these proteins (9Cushman I. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 27964-27973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 10Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). The addition of the isoprenyl tail facilitates binding to the cellular membranes and protein-protein interaction and increases the stability of the protein, thereby regulating the overall functional property of these proteins (7Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). Several oncogenes that undergo prenylation processing are known to promote cancer progression by activating proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells, and inhibiting prenylation of these proteins reduces their functional activity (10Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Hence, enzymes involved in the prenylation processing are attractive targets for cancer therapy (10Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 405-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 11Konstantinopoulos P.A. Karamouzis M.V. Papavassiliou A.G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 541-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar).We investigated the importance of C-terminal isoprenylation of C17orf37 protein with respect to its function. We show for the first time that C17orf37 is geranylgeranylated by GGTase-I and also undergoes postprenylation processing, and these modifications are important for correct localization of the C17orf37 protein. We also show that membrane-associated C17orf37 increases cellular migration by inducing increased filopodia formation at the leading edge of the migrating cell, whereas prenylation-deficient mutant C17orf37 failed to do so. We further confirm that ectopic expression of C17orf37 modulates the dissemination of cancer cells and facilitates formation of metastatic nodules in a mouse model of metastasis. Our data clearly indicate that C17orf37 prenylation is sufficient to drive cellular migration and colonization of injected nontransformed fibroblast cells to distant organs compared with the inactive mutant C17orf37 protein. These findings directly establish role for C17orf37 in the migration and metastatic dissemination of cancer cells and further elucidates the importance of isoprenyl modification in the function of C17orf37.

DISCUSSIONInformation concerning the importance of the novel gene C17orf37 in cancer biology is still emerging. Prompted by the finding that the gene is located in an important amplicon of chromosome 17q12 known as the “hot spot locus of cancer,” previous studies identified C17orf37 to be overexpressed in breast, colon, and prostate cancer (1Kauraniemi P. Kallioniemi A. Endocr. Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Maqani N. Belkhiri A. Moskaluk C. Knuutila S. Dar A.A. El-Rifai W. Mol.

Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and postulated that it could play an important role in cancer. In an attempt to understand the post-translational modifications of C17orf37 that may regulate its function, we identified a consensus prenylation motif CVIL at the C-terminal end. Both in vitro and in vivo prenylation assays confirmed C17orf37 is a substrate for the GGTase-I enzyme that catalyzes addition of 20-carbon isoprenyl group to the cysteine residue of CVIL motif (Fig. 1). Pharmacologic inhibition of GGTase-I and genetic inhibition of Icmt and Rce1 enzymes revealed that post-translational modifications are required for membrane association of C17orf37 protein (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). When this paper was under revision, Katz et al. (41Katz E. Dubois-Marshall S. Sims A.H. Faratian D. Li J. Smith E.S. Quinn J.A. Edward M. Meehan R.R. Evans E.E. Langdon S.P. Harrison D.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2010; 103: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) identified another motif at the N terminus of C17orf37 protein called immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, which is cross-phosphorylated at two tyrosine residues, and they show that phosphorylation is important for C17orf37 function. Therefore, it is quite evident that post-translational modification codes regulate the activity and stability of C17orf37 protein.Functionally, C17orf37 protein enhances the migratory and invasive ability of prostate cancer cells. Mutation of the Cys residue that is the site of prenylation (C112S) results in a protein that fails to be modified by GGTase-I and is functionally inactive (Fig. 5). Through both in vitro and in vivo studies, we find that prenylated C17orf37 enhances the migratory and metastatic ability of tumor cells to increase their colonization to distant organs, whereas a prenylation-defective mutant of C17orf37 fails to do so (Fig. 7). Because prenylated C17orf37 promotes migratory ability not proliferation of cells, its role may be restricted to the intravasation and extravasation steps of tumor metastasis.In a migrating cancer cell, C17orf37 preferentially localizes to the leading edge of the cell (4Dasgupta S. Wasson L.M. Rauniyar N. Prokai L. Borejdo J. Vishwanatha J.K. Oncogene. 2009; 28: 2860-2872Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), which is comprised of protrusive structures formed by polymerization of actin cytoskeleton. Mechanistic studies reveal that prenylated C17orf37 modulates filopodia formation and facilitates directional migration of cancer cells (Fig. 6). Filopodia formation is a tightly regulated process mediated by cortical actin polymerization in response to stimuli. Several proteins have been identified to mediate the assembly and disassembly of actin, which includes small GTPases like Rho family of proteins, Rac1, and Arp2/3 (actin-related protein) (38Mattila P.K. Lappalainen P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 446-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of these proteins are post-translationally modified by isoprenyl group addition important for protein-protein interaction and GTP loading. Although C17orf37 protein does not have a canonical GTP-binding site, it will be important to identify how C17orf37 protein induces filopodia formation. Because it is known that C17orf37 can act as a signaling molecule through the PI3K/Akt axis and activate NF-κB downstream genes MMP-9, uPA, and VEGF, it will be interesting to find whether C17orf37-induced filopodium formation is a direct effect mediated by the Akt pathway or by other regulatory processes engaged by C17orf37.Membrane is a vast dynamic structure composed of different classes of lipids. Our studies indicate that a majority of the prenylated C17orf37 protein localize to the membrane low in cholesterol composition (30Mayor S. Rao M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), whereas the mutant C17orf37 accumulates in the cytosol. Recently, there has been a great debate in the field to better understand the raft and nonraft lipid compositions and re-evaluate our understanding of the membrane microdomains (42Shaikh S.R. Edidin M.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 144: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that rafts are enriched in cholesterol and glycophosphatidylinositol (34van Meer G. Science. 2002; 296: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the lipid composition of non-cholesterol-rich membrane fraction is poorly understood (42Shaikh S.R. Edidin M.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 144: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Studies in prostate cancer cells have that revealed protein kinase B/Akt located in different compartments of plasma membrane (5Cinar B. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Meng G. Freeman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29584-29593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) regulates distinctive downstream signaling pathways. Our studies indicate that prenylated C17orf37 localizes outside the raft region (Fig. 4), and further studies are required to identify interactors of C17orf37 and lipid composition that favor its binding to the plasma membrane.Collectively, the findings of the present study broaden our understanding regarding the importance of C17orf37 in metastatic progression of cancer and the implications of post-translational isoprenylation on the functional activity of the protein. The present data also indicate that membrane association of C17orf37 is dependent on its post-translational modification at the C-terminal prenylation domain, which facilitates cellular migration by inducing filopodia formation and subsequent dissemination of cancer cells to distant organs. Because metastasis of cancer cells increases the mortality rate of human carcinomas, it is plausible that therapeutic strategies targeting C17orf37 may prove to be clinically useful to impede metastasis.

Because it is known that C17orf37 can act as a signaling molecule through the PI3K/Akt axis and activate NF-κB downstream genes MMP-9, uPA, and VEGF, it will be interesting to find whether C17orf37-induced filopodium formation is a direct effect mediated by the Akt pathway or by other regulatory processes engaged by C17orf37. Membrane is a vast dynamic structure composed of different classes of lipids. Our studies indicate that a majority of the prenylated C17orf37 protein localize to the membrane low in cholesterol composition (30Mayor S. Rao M. Traffic. 2004; 5: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), whereas the mutant C17orf37 accumulates in the cytosol. Recently, there has been a great debate in the field to better understand the raft and nonraft lipid compositions and re-evaluate our understanding of the membrane microdomains (42Shaikh S.R. Edidin M.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 144: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although it is clear that rafts are enriched in cholesterol and glycophosphatidylinositol (34van Meer G. Science. 2002; 296: 855-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the lipid composition of non-cholesterol-rich membrane fraction is poorly understood (42Shaikh S.R. Edidin M.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2006; 144: 1-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Studies in prostate cancer cells have that revealed protein kinase B/Akt located in different compartments of plasma membrane (5Cinar B. Mukhopadhyay N.K. Meng G. Freeman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29584-29593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) regulates distinctive downstream signaling pathways. Our studies indicate that prenylated C17orf37 localizes outside the raft region (Fig. 4), and further studies are required to identify interactors of C17orf37 and lipid composition that favor its binding to the plasma membrane. Collectively, the findings of the present study broaden our understanding regarding the importance of C17orf37 in metastatic progression of cancer and the implications of post-translational isoprenylation on the functional activity of the protein. The present data also indicate that membrane association of C17orf37 is dependent on its post-translational modification at the C-terminal prenylation domain, which facilitates cellular migration by inducing filopodia formation and subsequent dissemination of cancer cells to distant organs. Because metastasis of cancer cells increases the mortality rate of human carcinomas, it is plausible that therapeutic strategies targeting C17orf37 may prove to be clinically useful to impede metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W2035167377,"Currently, MVA virus vectors carrying HIV-1 genes are being developed as HIV-1/AIDS prophylactic/therapeutic vaccines. Nevertheless, little is known about the impact of these vectors on human dendritic cells (DC) and their capacity to present HIV-1 antigens to human HIV-specific T cells. This study aimed to characterize the interaction of MVA and MVA expressing the HIV-1 genes Env-Gag-Pol-Nef of clade B (referred to as MVA-B) in human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC) and the subsequent processes of HIV-1 antigen presentation and activation of memory HIV-1-specific T lymphocytes. For these purposes, we performed ex vivo assays with MDDC and autologous lymphocytes from asymptomatic HIV-infected patients. Infection of MDDC with MVA-B or MVA, at the optimal dose of 0.3 PFU/MDDC, induced by itself a moderate degree of maturation of MDDC, involving secretion of cytokines and chemokines (IL1-ra, IL-7, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, RANTES, IP-10, MIG, and IFN-α). MDDC infected with MVA or MVA-B and following a period of 48 h or 72 h of maturation were able to migrate toward CCL19 or CCL21 chemokine gradients. MVA-B infection induced apoptosis of the infected cells and the resulting apoptotic bodies were engulfed by the uninfected MDDC, which cross-presented HIV-1 antigens to autologous CD8(+) T lymphocytes. MVA-B-infected MDDC co-cultured with autologous T lymphocytes induced a highly functional HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell response including proliferation, secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, MIP-1β, MIP-1α, RANTES and IL-6, and strong cytotoxic activity against autologous HIV-1-infected CD4(+) T lymphocytes. These results evidence the adjuvant role of the vector itself (MVA) and support the clinical development of prophylactic and therapeutic anti-HIV vaccines based on MVA-B."
https://openalex.org/W1987907034,"Important advances have been made in the immunodiagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) based on the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB)-specific T cells. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the immunological approach are relatively low because there are no specific markers for antigen-specific Th cells, and some of the Th cells that do not produce cytokines can be overlooked using this approach. In this study, we found that MTB-specific peptides of ESAT-6/CFP-10 can stimulate the expression of CD40L specifically in CD4(+) T cells but not other cells from pleural fluid cells (PFCs) in patients with tuberculous pleurisy (TBP). CD4(+)CD40L(+) but not CD4(+)CD40L(-) T cells express IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-17 or IL-22 after stimulation with MTB-specific peptides. In addition, CD4(+)CD40L(+) T cells were found to be mostly polyfunctional T cells that simultaneously produce IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α and display an effector or effector memory phenotype (CD45RA(-)CD45RO(+)CCR7(-)CD62L(-)ICOS(-)). To determine the specificity of CD4(+)CD40L(+) T cells, we incubated PFCs with ESTA-6/CFP-10 peptides and sorted live CD4(+)CD40L(+) and CD4(+)CD40L(-) T cells by flow cytometry. We further demonstrated that sorted CD4(+)CD40L(+), but not CD4(+)CD40L(-) fractions, principally produced IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-17 and IL-22 following restimulation with ESTA-6/CFP-10 peptides. Taken together, our data indicate that the expression of CD40L on MTB-specific CD4(+) T cells could be a good marker for the evaluation and isolation of MTB-specific Th cells and might also be useful in the diagnosis of TB."
https://openalex.org/W1970084707,"A proper balance of lipid breakdown and synthesis is essential for achieving energy homeostasis as alterations in either of these processes can lead to pathological states such as obesity. The regulation of lipid metabolism is quite complex with multiple signals integrated to control overall triglyceride levels in metabolic tissues. Based upon studies demonstrating effects of the circadian clock on metabolism, we sought to determine if the central clock cells in the Drosophila brain contribute to lipid levels in the fat body, the main nutrient storage organ of the fly. Here, we show that altering the function of the Drosophila central clock neurons leads to an increase in fat body triglycerides. We also show that although triglyceride levels are not affected by age, they are increased by expression of the amyloid-beta protein in central clock neurons. The effect on lipid storage seems to be independent of circadian clock output as changes in triglycerides are not always observed in genetic manipulations that result in altered locomotor rhythms. These data demonstrate that the activity of the central clock neurons is necessary for proper lipid storage."
https://openalex.org/W2031911619,"Stereocilia are actin-filled protrusions that permit mechanotransduction in the internal ear. To identify proteins that organize the cytoskeleton of stereocilia, we scrutinized the hair-cell transcriptome of zebrafish. One promising candidate encodes fascin 2b, a filamentous actin-bundling protein found in retinal photoreceptors. Immunolabeling of zebrafish hair cells and the use of transgenic zebrafish that expressed fascin 2b fused to green fluorescent protein demonstrated that fascin 2b localized to stereocilia specifically. When filamentous actin and recombinant fusion protein containing fascin 2b were combined in vitro to determine their dissociation constant, a Kd≈0.37 µM was observed. Electron microscopy showed that fascin 2b-actin filament complexes formed parallel actin bundles in vitro. We demonstrated that expression of fascin 2b or espin, another actin-bundling protein, in COS-7 cells induced the formation of long filopodia. Coexpression showed synergism between these proteins through the formation of extra-long protrusions. Using phosphomutant fascin 2b proteins, which mimicked either a phosphorylated or a nonphosphorylated state, in COS-7 cells and in transgenic hair cells, we showed that both formation of long filopodia and localization of fascin 2b to stereocilia were dependent on serine 38. Overexpression of wild-type fascin 2b in hair cells was correlated with increased stereociliary length relative to controls. These findings indicate that fascin 2b plays a key role in shaping stereocilia."
https://openalex.org/W2036782104,"Background Naturally occurring CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells develop in the thymus and represent a mature T cell subpopulation critically involved in maintaining peripheral tolerance. The differentiation of Treg cells in the thymus requires T cell receptor (TCR)/CD28 stimulation along with cytokine-promoted Foxp3 induction. TCR-mediated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation seems to be involved in differentiation of Treg cells because deletion of components of the NF-κB signaling pathway, as well as of NF-κB transcription factors, leads to markedly decreased Treg cell numbers in thymus and periphery. Methodology/Principal Findings To investigate if Treg cell-intrinsic NF-κB activation is required for thymic development and peripheral homeostasis of Treg cells we used transgenic (Tg) mice with thymocyte-specific expression of a stable IκBα mutant to inhibit NF-κB activation solely within the T cell lineage. Here we show that Treg cell-intrinsic NF-κB activation is important for the generation of cytokine-responsive Foxp3− thymic Treg precursors and their further differentiation into mature Treg cells. Treg cell development could neither be completely rescued by the addition of exogenous Interleukin 2 (IL-2) nor by the presence of wild-type derived cells in adoptive transfer experiments. However, peripheral NF-κB activation appears to be required for IL-2 production by conventional T cells, thereby participating in Treg cell homeostasis. Moreover, pharmacological NF-κB inhibition via the IκB kinase β (IKKβ) inhibitor AS602868 led to markedly diminished thymic and peripheral Treg cell frequencies. Conclusion/Significance Our results indicate that Treg cell-intrinsic NF-κB activation is essential for thymic Treg cell differentiation, and further suggest pharmacological NF-κB inhibition as a potential therapeutic approach for manipulating this process."
https://openalex.org/W2077444727,"The aminobisphosphonate zoledronic acid has elicited significant attention due to its remarkable anti-tumoral activity, although its detailed mechanism of action remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate the existence of a nuclear GSK-3β-NFATc2 stabilization pathway that promotes breast and pancreatic cancer growth in vitro and in vivo and serves as a bona fide target of zoledronic acid. Specifically, the serine/threonine kinase GSK-3β stabilizes nuclear NFATc2 through phosphorylation of the serine-rich SP2 domain, thus protecting the transcription factor from E3-ubiquitin ligase HDM2-mediated proteolysis. Zoledronic acid disrupts this NFATc2 stabilization pathway through two mechanisms, namely GSK-3β inhibition and induction of HDM2 activity. Upon nuclear accumulation, HDM2 targets unphosphorylated NFATc2 for ubiquitination at acceptor lysine residues Lys-684/Lys-897 and hence labels the factor for subsequent proteasomal degradation. Conversely, mutagenesis-induced constitutive serine phosphorylation (Ser-215, Ser-219, and Ser-223) of the SP2 domain prevents NFATc2 from HDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation and consequently rescues cancer cells from growth suppression by zoledronic acid. In conclusion, this study demonstrates a critical role of the GSK-3β-HDM2 signaling loop in the regulation of NFATc2 protein stability and growth promotion and suggests that double targeting of this pathway is responsible, at least to a significant part, for the potent and reliable anti-tumoral effects of zoledronic acid.

Furthermore, besides these well characterized effects on skeletal metastasis, increasing evidence from preclinical and clinical trials demonstrate that ZOL exhibits strong anti-tumor functions outside of the bone. In certain epithelial cancers, ZOL has a high selectivity for targeting tumor cells, resulting in inhibition of tumor outgrowth, reduced incidence of visceral metastasis, and increased overall survival (5Peng H.

In fact, a recent large study reported a substantial reduction of local breast cancer recurrence after surgery when endocrine therapy was combined with ZOL (9Gnant M. Mlineritsch B. Schippinger W.

Therefore, ZOL may not only become the drug of choice for many translational and clinical studies in cancer but may also serve as a platform to develop novel therapeutic strategies in cancer treatment.

Here, we describe a new NFATc2-dependent mechanism modulating cell growth in breast and pancreatic cancer and identify this novel pathway as a bona fide target of ZOL. We demonstrate a role for GSK-3β-dependent phosphorylation in NFATc2 protein stabilization and growth promotion in cancer. ZOL interferes with this phenomenon by acting as a GSK-3β inhibitor. In addition, by inducing HDM2-mediated polyubiquitination and degradation of NFATc2, ZOL operates as a new functional antagonist of NFATc2, which acts via a different mechanism than the well established calcineurin-NFAT inhibitors. This double interference with the same pathway is responsible, at least in part, for the potent and reliable growth suppression effects of ZOL in cancer. In conclusion, the current study of a novel biochemical mechanism that regulates the lifetime and growth-promoting functions of oncogenic NFATc2 as well as the identification of this signaling loop as an important target for ZOL-mediated breast and pancreatic cancer cell growth inhibition carry significant potential implications for both basic science and clinical medicine. Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-435 and MDA-MB-231 and pancreatic cancer cell lines IMIM-PC1, Suit-028, and PaTu8988t were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% FCS.

ZOL was obtained from Novartis Oncology (Basel, Switzerland). LinxA cells were purchased from Open Biosystems (Huntsville, AL) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium (PAA Laboratories GmbH, Pasching, Austria) supplemented with 10% FCS and 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany). For retroviral expression, HA-tagged wt-NFATc2, as well as the mutated HA-NFATc2 pSP2 construct, were cloned into a pQCXIP vector (BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany). For retroviral production, the packaging cell line LinxA was transfected with 5 μg of the retroviral plasmids in a 10-cm dish using LipofectamineTM 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 and 72 h after transfection, the supernatant containing retroviral particles was filtered through a 0.45-μm filter and supplemented with 2 μg/ml Polybrene (Millipore, Billerica, MA) to infect the target cells PaTu8988t and Suit-028. Spin infection was carried out at 2500 × g and at 37 °C. Transduced cells were selected with 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich) for at least 2 weeks. The successful overexpression of the NFATc2 constructs was tested by immunoblotting. All murine NFATc2 constructs were generated in pcDNA3.1 (+) HA tag vector by subcloning of the wt-NFATc2 open reading frame into HindIII and XbaI. The ΔSP2 mutation was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) by introducing single-point mutations at serines Ser-215, Ser-219, and Ser-223 (corresponding to human NFATc2 serines at Ser-213, Ser-215, and Ser-221), respectively. Serine residues Ser-215 and Ser-219 were exchanged to alanine using the following primers: 5′-gctcattatgcccccagaaccgctccaataatg-3′ and 5′-cgagtaatacgggggtcttggcgaggttattac-3′, and serine 223 was exchanged using the following primers: 5′-ccgctccaataatggcacctcgaaccagcc-3′ and 5′-ggctggttcgaggtgccattattggagcgg-3′. The pSP2 mutation was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the ΔSP2 mutant. Alanine 215 and 219 were exchanged to glutamic acid using the primers: 5′-gctcattatgaccccagaaccgatccaataatg-3′ and 5′-cattattggatcggttctggggtcataatgagc-3′, and alanine 223 was exchanged using the primers: 5′-ccgatccaataatggaacctcgaaccagcc-3′ and 5′-ggctggttcgaggttccattattggatcgg-3′.

Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with a fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies, and nuclei were counterstained with 4′6-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides and subjected to fluorescence microscopy (Carl Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany). To enlarge the axial resolution, we used the structured illumination microscopy (Carl Zeiss Inc.). Immunohistochemical analysis of tumors explanted from nude mice or human cancer tissues (provided by the Institute of Pathology, University of Marburg, Germany) was performed as described previously (13Buchholz M.

Briefly, paraffin sections were stained with anti-NFATc2 (1:250, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), GSK-3β, phospho-GSK-3β (both 1:200, Cell Signaling), or anti Ki-67 (1:700, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Antibody binding was visualized using a biotinylated secondary antibody, with avidin-conjugated peroxidase (ABC method; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride as a substrate and hematoxylin as counter staining, and evaluated by standard light microscopy. The indicated cell lines were seeded in 24-well plates, transfected with the indicated siRNA oligonucleotides, and treated with 10 μm ZOL or left untreated for the indicated time periods. [3H]Thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) was added during the last 6 h of incubation. Cells were washed with 5% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and incubated with 1 m NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C. Radioactivity was determined with a scintillation counter. All proliferation assays were performed in triplicates in at least three independent experiments. For flow cytometry analyses, cells were seeded in 6-well plates and treated with ZOL (10 μm) for 72 h or left untreated. Cells were then resuspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 20 μl of propidium iodide (2 mg/ml) and 50 μl of RNase (100 μg/ml) for 3 h. The DNA content of 106 cells was analyzed with a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer using Cell Quest software from BD Biosciences. Cells were treated with ZOL (10 μm) for the indicated time periods. After treatment, total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), and first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA using random primers and the SuperScript first-strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a 7500 fast real-time PCR system from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, MA). Specific primer pairs were designed with the PrimerExpress 3.0 (Applied Biosystems, Wellesley, MA) system. The following primers were used for our studies: human NFATc2, forward, 5′-gttcctaccccacagtcattcag-3′, and reverse, 5′-cccgcaggtaatacttccttttg-3′; HDM2, forward, 5′-gggacgccatcgaatcc-3′, and reverse, 5′-atccaaccaatcacctgaatgtt-3′; XS-13, forward, 5′-gtcggaggagtcggacgag-3′, and reverse 5′-gcctttatttccttgttttgcaaa-3′. For reporter gene studies, 106 cells were seeded into 12-well tissue culture dishes and transfected after 24 h with the indicated constructs. Cells were treated with ZOL (10 μm) for 72 h before cells were harvested, and luciferase assays were performed using a Lumat LB 9501 luminometer (Berthold Technologies) and the Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase activity and were expressed either as relative luciferase activity or as mean “-fold induction” with respect to empty vector control. Mean values are displayed ± S.D. Murine wild-type-HA-NFATc2 construct was transfected in PaTu8988t cells, and 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody. To perform in vitro kinase assays, protein G-agarose-bound HA-NFATc2 proteins were incubated with recombinant GSK-3β (500,000 units/ml; New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris HCL, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 200 μm ATP (cold), and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The beads were spun down, resuspended in an equal volume of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE, and the protein phosphorylation state was detected by autoradiography. 6–8-week-old pathogen-free female athymic nu/nu mice were obtained from Harlan Winkelman (Harlan Winkelman GmbH, Borchen, Germany). We injected 1 × 106 IMIM-PC1 or MDA-MB-435 cancer cells mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) subcutaneously into both flanks of nude mice. After the establishment of visible tumors, mice were randomized into two groups and received either 1 mg/kg of ZOL (i.p. three times a week) or 10% DMSO as vehicle control. Mice and tumor size were monitored weekly. The tumor volume (V) was determined by using the formula: (4/3π × (L/2) × (W/2) × (H/2)); (L = length, W = width, H = height). After 4 weeks of treatment, mice were sacrificed, and tumors were explanted and analyzed by size and weight and subjected to immunohistochemistry. Animal experiments were carried out using protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Marburg. Mean values and S.D. were calculated for all countable results. For statistical analysis, Student's t test was used, and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Previous studies performed in cultured cell lines in vitro have shown that both breast and pancreatic cancer cells serve as suitable models for observing the growth-suppressing effect of zoledronic acid (10Ottewell P.D.

For this reason, we utilized a series of established human epithelial cancer cell lines derived from ductal pancreatic and breast cancers as models to search for cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the growth suppressor activities of ZOL. Initially, we performed [3H]thymidine incorporation assays and flow cytometry analysis to determine the effect of ZOL on tumor cell growth in vitro. Treatment of cancer cells with ZOL (10 μm) led to a time-dependent reduction of cancer cell proliferation, which was evident after 24–48 h and reached maximum 72 h upon treatment (Fig. 1A). Depending on the tested pancreatic and breast cancer cell line, ZOL caused a 60–80% inhibition of cell proliferation (Fig. 1B). Flow cytometry analysis further showed that inhibition of cancer cell proliferation originated from induction of a G1 cell cycle arrest, as evidenced by the shift of cancer cells from the S to the G1 phase (Fig. 1C). Consistently, we found reduced expression levels of cyclin D1 and its partner kinases CdK4 and CdK6 over time (Fig. 1D). To assess whether tumor growth suppression by ZOL can be recapitulated in vivo, we carried out growth studies in a xenograft tumor model following injection of either IMIM-PC1 pancreatic cancer cells or MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells into the flanks of athymic nude mice. We allowed the development of sizable subcutaneous tumors before we started with ZOL or DMSO control treatment (i.p. three times a week). Tumor volumes were measured once a week for a treatment period of 4 weeks, animals then were sacrificed, and tumor masses were extracted for volume measurement and immunohistochemical analyses. In congruence with our in vitro data, ZOL treatment caused a significant reduction of tumor mass over time (Fig. 1E, top panel; supplemental Fig. 1A), and this growth retardation resulted from reduced cell proliferation, indicated by decreased Ki-67 staining (Fig. 1E, bottom panel). Together, the combined data from our in vitro and in vivo analysis suggested that G1 cell cycle arrest is a key cellular response underlying ZOL-induced cancer growth suppression. ZOL controls cellular responses through modulation of intracellular Ca2+ fluxes (15Tenta R. Pitulis N. Tiblalexi D. Consoulas C. Katopodis H. Konstantinidou E. Manoussakis M. Kletsas D. Alexis M.N.

NFATc2 is a prototypic Ca2+-signaling regulated transcription factor with strong growth-promoting activities in cancer (12Köenig A. Linhart T. Schlengemann K. Reutlinger K. Wegele J. Adler G. Singh G. Hofmann L. Kunsch S. Büch T. Schäfer E. Gress T.M. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Ellenrieder V.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 540-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). For instance, NFATc2 controls promoter induction of the c-Myc proto-oncogene and stimulates pancreatic cancer cell growth in response to increases in Ca2+ concentrations. We found high expression levels and a predominant nuclear localization of NFATc2 in both pancreatic and breast cancer tissues (supplemental Fig. 1B) and in the analyzed cancer cell lines (12Köenig A. Linhart T. Schlengemann K. Reutlinger K. Wegele J. Adler G. Singh G. Hofmann L. Kunsch S. Büch T. Schäfer E. Gress T.M. Fernandez-Zapico M.E. Ellenrieder V. Gastroenterology. 2010; 138: 1189-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Consistent with a key role of NFATc2 in G1/S cell cycle progression, genetic depletion of the nuclear factor caused a profound reduction of cancer cell growth and diminished expression of G1/S-phase-promoting genes (supplemental Fig. 1, C and D). Initial experimental evidence supporting NFATc2 as a molecular target of ZOL in cancer was provided by reporter gene assays using an NFAT-responsive promoter construct (cis-NFAT) harboring three consensus binding sites for the transcription factor fused to the luciferase gene. Cancer cells were transfected with cis-NFAT reporter plasmids along with NFATc2 and treated with the bisphosphonate for 48 h. Interestingly, ZOL treatment caused a complete blockade of NFATc2 promoter transactivation, and this effect was associated with a dramatic and time-dependent reduction of NFATc2 protein expression levels in all cancer cell lines derived from the breast and pancreas (Fig. 2, A–C). Importantly, loss of NFATc2 expression upon treatment resulted from accelerated protein turnover of the transcription factor rather than inhibition of its gene transcription. Therefore, no significant changes in NFATc2 promoter activity (data not shown) or mRNA expression were found up to 48 h after treatment (Fig. 2D). However, application of MG-132, a cell-permeable and reversible inhibitor of proteasomal degradation, prevented NFATc2 down-regulation by ZOL, and this was paralleled by a strong ubiquitination signal of the factor with a characteristic ladder indicative of polyubiquitination (Fig. 2, E and F). Together, these studies demonstrated that ZOL modulates NFATc2 expression and activity in breast and pancreatic cancer cells and suggested that proteasomal degradation of the pro-proliferative factor is an underlying mechanism mediating cancer growth suppression by this bisphosphonate. Inactive NFAT proteins reside in the cytoplasm in a highly phosphorylated version. Dephosphorylation of the factor through the action of the Ca2+-regulated phosphatase calcineurin allows its shuttling into the nucleus, where NFAT binds target gene promoters for transcriptional regulation (17Macian F. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). NFAT activation can be reversed by phosphorylation through the action of distinct export kinases, e.g. GSK-3β, which induce the cytosolic translocation of the transcription factor so that it is poised for the next activating stimulus. Interestingly, an additional role of the export kinase GSK-3β in NFATc2 regulation and function has most recently been postulated in breast cancer, suggesting that the kinase might cooperate with the transcription factor to stimulate cancer cell migration (18Yoeli-Lerner M. Chin Y.R. Hansen C.K. Toker A. Mol. Cancer Res. 2009; 7: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that, consistent with a cooperative oncogenic function of both molecules in cancer, we found concomitant expression of NFATc2 and GSK-3β in cancer tissues and cell lines (Fig. 3, A and B). In addition, genetic depletion of GSK-3β exerted an effect on NFATc2 expression and function similar to ZOL treatment, namely transcriptional inactivation and accelerated protein turnover of the transcription factor (supplemental Fig. 2, A–D). These findings emphasized a pro-proliferative activity of the GSK-3β-NFATc2 pathway in both cancer cell models and suggested that ZOL treatment targets this oncogenic pathway for inactivation. In fact, ZOL treatment inhibits GSK-3β activity in a dose-dependent manner both in vitro and in vivo, as evidenced by increased Ser-9 phosphorylation and/or reduced levels of phospho-glycogen synthase, and as a consequence of this, treatment caused a profound loss of endogenous NFATc2 in cultured cancer cells and in their corresponding xenograft tumors (Fig. 3, C–E; supplemental Fig. 2E). To provide direct evidence of the effect of ZOL on GSK-3β kinase activity to phosphorylate NFATc2, an in vitro kinase assay was performed with recombinant GSK-3β and immunoprecipitated wild-type HA-NFATc2 in the presence or absence of ZOL. As shown in Fig. 2F, GSK-3β efficiently catalyzed the incorporation of phosphate into the NFATc2 substrate, whereas ZOL did not alter this kinase reaction, suggesting that ZOL indirectly blocks GSK-3β activity. Finally, introduction of a constitutively active GSK-3β version protected the GSK-3β-NFATc2 pathway from ZOL-induced disruption and hence prevented NFATc2 from proteasomal degradation (Fig. 3F). Thus, these findings emphasized that ZOL inhibits the GSK-3β-mediated signaling pathway under normal physiological conditions. Taken together, these studies revealed the existence of a pro-proliferative GSK-3β-NFATc2 phosphorylation and stabilization pathway in cancer and identified this pathway as a prime target of ZOL anti-tumor function. Next, we set out a bioinformatics-based analysis to identify putative GSK-3β phosphorylation sites within the NFATc2 sequence. These studies revealed three consensus GSK-3β serine phosphorylation residues located in the SP2 motif of the NFAT homology region (Fig. 4A). These phospho-serine residues, previously implicated in NFAT nuclear export, are highly conserved among species and match with the “phospho-degron” sequence, a key identification code for GSK-3β to label other transcriptional regulators (e.g. β-catenin, SRC-3, and Notch-1) for phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination (19Wu R.C. Feng Q. Lonard D.M. O'Malley B.W. Cell. 2007; 129: 1125-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 20Welcker M. Orian A. Jin J. Grim J.E. Harper J.W. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 9085-9090Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). These data led us to hypothesize that GSK-3β also targets NFATc2 through conserved phospho-degron sequences: in this case, however, to stabilize the transcription factor in cancer cells. To verify this hypothesis, we generated mutations of murine NFATc2 in which the phospho-degron elements were modified through substitution of phospho-serines for either alanine to obtain a non-phosphorylatable NFATc2 mutant (referred to as ΔSP2) or glutamic acid to generate a mutant that mimics constitutive phosphorylation by GSK-3β (referred to as pSP2), respectively (Fig. 4B). We then determined the significance of the GSK-3β phospho-serines for NFATc2 stability and inactivation by ZOL in cancer cells. The results shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that wild-type NFATc2 behaved similar to its endogenous counterpart, and therefore, it was sufficiently ubiquitinated and metabolized following ZOL treatment (Fig. 4, E and F). Mutational inactivation of the GSK-3β-targeted phospho-serines Ser-215, Ser-219, and Ser-223 (ΔSP2) further increased susceptibility of NFATc2 and led to accelerated protein turnover and degradation of the transcription factor in canc"
https://openalex.org/W2027140512,"Predation affects life history traits of nearly all organisms and the population consequences of predator avoidance are often larger than predation itself. Climate change has been shown to cause phenological changes. These changes are not necessarily similar between species and may cause mismatches between prey and predator. Eurasian sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus, the main predator of passerines, has advanced its autumn phenology by about ten days in 30 years due to climate change. However, we do not know if sparrowhawk migrate earlier in response to earlier migration by its prey or if earlier sparrowhawk migration results in changes to predation risk on its prey. By using the median departure date of 41 passerine species I was able to show that early migrating passerines tend to advance, and late migrating species delay their departure, but none of the species have advanced their departure times as much as the sparrowhawk. This has lead to a situation of increased predation risk on early migrating long-distance migrants (LDM) and decreased the overlap of migration season with later departing short-distance migrants (SDM). Findings highlight the growing list of problems of declining LDM populations caused by climate change. On the other hand it seems that the autumn migration may become safer for SDM whose populations are growing. Results demonstrate that passerines show very conservative response in autumn phenology to climate change, and thus phenological mismatches caused by global warming are not necessarily increasing towards the higher trophic levels."
https://openalex.org/W2116629927,"Adenosine (ADO) is an extracellular signaling molecule that is an important regulator of innate lung defense. On binding ADO, the A2B receptor (A2BR) stimulates cAMP production to activate the CFTR Cl(-) channel, increase ciliary beating, and initiate cytokine secretion. We tested the hypothesis that CFTR served as a positive regulator of the A2BRs. We found that A2BR and CFTR coimmunoprecipitated. They also underwent ADO-dependent Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), which increased from 5% in the absence of agonist to 18% with 100 μM ADO (EC₅₀ 1.7 μM), suggesting that they dynamically associate in the plasma membrane. In contrast, despite colocalization, no FRET was observed between CFTR and GAP43. The interaction between A2BR and CFTR had some specificity: A2BR-stimulated but not forskolin-stimulated cAMP production was ~50% greater in the presence of CFTR, due to a CFTR-dependent increase in plasma membrane A2BR levels. These CFTR-dependent increases in A2BR levels and cAMP production resulted in significantly enhanced ciliary beating and increased cytokine secretion in normal compared to cystic fibrosis airway epithelia. Thus, we hypothesize that CFTR regulates A2BR levels in the plasma membrane to modulate cell signaling and to enhance selective components of the innate lung defense system."
https://openalex.org/W1975195514,"The N-glycans of membrane glycoproteins are mainly exposed to the extracellular space. Human tyrosinase is a transmembrane glycoprotein with six or seven bulky N-glycans exposed towards the lumen of subcellular organelles. The central active site region of human tyrosinase is modeled here within less than 2.5 Å accuracy starting from Streptomyces castaneoglobisporus tyrosinase. The model accounts for the last five C-terminus glycosylation sites of which four are occupied and indicates that these cluster in two pairs - one in close vicinity to the active site and the other on the opposite side. We have analyzed and compared the roles of all tyrosinase N-glycans during tyrosinase processing with a special focus on the proximal to the active site N-glycans, s6:N337 and s7:N371, versus s3:N161 and s4:N230 which decorate the opposite side of the domain. To this end, we have constructed mutants of human tyrosinase in which its seven N-glycosylation sites were deleted. Ablation of the s6:N337 and s7:N371 sites arrests the post-translational productive folding process resulting in terminally misfolded mutants subjected to degradation through the mannosidase driven ERAD pathway. In contrast, single mutants of the other five N-glycans located either opposite to the active site or into the N-terminus Cys1 extension of tyrosinase are temperature-sensitive mutants and recover enzymatic activity at the permissive temperature of 31°C. Sites s3 and s4 display selective calreticulin binding properties. The C-terminus sites s7 and s6 are critical for the endoplasmic reticulum retention and intracellular disposal. Results herein suggest that individual N-glycan location is critical for the stability, regional folding control and secretion of human tyrosinase and explains some tyrosinase gene missense mutations associated with oculocutaneous albinism type I."
https://openalex.org/W2020861385,"Background Geminiviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses that infect a number of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants. Arabidopsis is susceptible to infection with the Curtovirus, Beet severe curly top virus (BSCTV). Infection of Arabidopsis with BSCTV causes severe symptoms characterized by stunting, leaf curling, and the development of abnormal inflorescence and root structures. BSCTV-induced symptom development requires the virus-encoded C4 protein which is thought to interact with specific plant-host proteins and disrupt signaling pathways important for controlling cell division and development. Very little is known about the specific plant regulatory factors that participate in BSCTV-induced symptom development. This study was conducted to identify specific transcription factors that are induced by BSCTV infection. Methodology/Principal Findings Arabidopsis plants were inoculated with BSCTV and the induction of specific transcription factors was monitored using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays. We found that the ATHB12 and ATHB7 genes, members of the homeodomain-leucine zipper family of transcription factors previously shown to be induced by abscisic acid and water stress, are induced in symptomatic tissues of Arabidopsis inoculated with BSCTV. ATHB12 expression is correlated with an array of morphological abnormalities including leaf curling, stunting, and callus-like structures in infected Arabidopsis. Inoculation of plants with a BSCTV mutant with a defective c4 gene failed to induce ATHB12. Transgenic plants expressing the BSCTV C4 gene exhibited increased ATHB12 expression whereas BSCTV-infected ATHB12 knock-down plants developed milder symptoms and had lower ATHB12 expression compared to the wild-type plants. Reporter gene studies demonstrated that the ATHB12 promoter was responsive to BSCTV infection and the highest expression levels were observed in symptomatic tissues where cell cycle genes also were induced. Conclusions/Significance These results suggest that ATHB7 and ATHB12 may play an important role in the activation of the abnormal cell division associated with symptom development during geminivirus infection."

Different strategies have been developed to cope with this problem depending on the distribution of cyanobacteria in the water column. Principal Findings Here we provide an experimental proof that the light intensity plays an important role in the vertical distribution of seven, closely related, epibenthic Synechococcus spp. strains isolated from various water depths from the littoral zone of Lake Constance in Germany and cultivated under laboratory conditions. Pigment analysis revealed that the amount of chlorophyll a and total carotenoids decreased with the time of light stress exposure in three phycoerythrin-rich strains collected from 7.0 m water depth and remained low during the recovery phase. In contrast, a constant level of chlorophyll a and either constant or enhanced levels of carotenoids were assayed in phycocyanin-rich strains collected from 1.0 and 0.5 m water depths. Protein analysis revealed that while the amount of biliproteins remained constant in all strains during light stress and recovery, the amount of D1 protein from photosystem II reaction centre was strongly reduced under light stress conditions in strains from 7.0 m and 1.0 m water depth, but not in strains collected from 0.5 m depth. Conclusion Based on these data we propose that light intensity, in addition to light quality, is an important selective force in the vertical distribution of Synechococcus spp. strains, depending on their genetically fixed mechanisms for photoprotection."
https://openalex.org/W2084549565,"The choice of promoter is a critical step in optimizing the efficiency and stability of recombinant protein production in mammalian cell lines. Artificial promoters that provide stable expression across cell lines and can be designed to the desired strength constitute an alternative to the use of viral promoters. Here, we show how the nucleotide characteristics of highly active human promoters can be modelled via the genome-wide frequency distribution of short motifs: by overlapping motifs that occur infrequently in the genome, we constructed contiguous sequence that is rich in GC and CpGs, both features of known promoters, but lacking homology to real promoters. We show that snippets from this sequence, at 100 base pairs or longer, drive gene expression in vitro in a number of mammalian cells, and are thus candidates for use in protein production. We further show that expression is driven by the general transcription factors TFIIB and TFIID, both being ubiquitously present across cell types, which results in less tissue- and species-specific regulation compared to the viral promoter SV40. We lastly found that the strength of a promoter can be tuned up and down by modulating the counts of GC and CpGs in localized regions. These results constitute a ""proof-of-concept"" for custom-designing promoters that are suitable for biotechnological and medical applications."
https://openalex.org/W2124919461,"DNA exchange in bacteria via conjugative plasmids is believed to be among the most important contributing factors to the rapid evolution- and diversification rates observed in bacterial species. The IncX1 plasmids are particularly interesting in relation to enteric bacteria, and typically carry genetic loads like antibiotic resistance genes and virulence factors. So far, however, a “pure” version of these molecular parasites, without genetic loads, has yet to be isolated from the environment. Here we report the construction of pX1.0, a fully synthesized IncX1 plasmid capable of horizontal transfer between different enteric bacteria. The designed pX1.0 sequence was derived from the consensus gene content of five IncX1 plasmids and three other, more divergent, members of the same phylogenetic group. The pX1.0 plasmid was shown to replicate stably in E. coli with a plasmid DNA per total DNA ratio corresponding to approximately 3–9 plasmids per chromosome depending on the growth phase of the host. Through conjugation, pX1.0 was able to self-transfer horizontally into an isogenic strain of E. coli as well as into two additional species belonging to the family Enterobacteriaceae.

IntroductionFactor F (FVIII) 2The abbreviations used are: FVIIIfactor VIIIFVIIIafactor VIIIaFIXafactor IXaFXfactor XFXaactivated factor XPCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePSphosphatidylserine. is a plasma protein that is decreased or defective in individuals with hemophilia A. FVIII is expressed as both single chain and heterodimer forms in heterologous cells. The latter consists of a heavy chain composed of A1(a1)A2(a2)B domains and a light chain composed of (a3)A3C1C2 domains, with the lowercase “a” representing short segments rich in acidic residues (see Ref. 1Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar for review). FVIII is activated following limited proteolysis catalyzed by thrombin or FXa at Arg-372 (a1A2 junction), Arg-740 (a2B junction), and Arg-1689 (a3A3 junction). The resulting product, FVIIIa, is a heterotrimer composed of subunits designated A1, A2, and A3C1C2 that functions as a cofactor for FIXa in the membrane-dependent activation of FX to FXa (see Ref 1Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar for review).Earlier structural studies identified the C2 domain as making a primary contribution to anionic phospholipid membrane binding through a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (2Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). More recently, the intermediate resolution x-ray structures of FVIII (3Shen B.W. Spiegel P.C. Chang C.H. Huh J.W. Lee J.S. Kim J. Kim Y.H. Stoddard B.L. Blood. 2008; 111: 1240-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 4Ngo J.C. Huang M. Roth D.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. Structure. 2008; 16: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) showed that the C1 and C2 domains are aligned such that both domains may interact with the phospholipid membrane surface. In addition, these structures show close contact between A1 (heavy chain) and C2 (light chain) domains. We recently reported that an FVIII variant lacking the C2 domain retained the capacity to bind phospholipid membranes, albeit with a marked reduction in affinity (5Wakabayashi H. Griffiths A.E. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 25176-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), supporting a direct role for the C1 domain in this interaction. Furthermore, deletion of the C2 domain did not grossly alter a number of functional properties including the rate of procofactor activation by thrombin, affinity of FVIIIa for FIXa, Km of Factor Xase (FXase) for substrate FX, or kcat for FXa generation. However, this deletion did significantly destabilize the cofactor, as judged by increased rates of activity decay following exposure to elevated temperature or chemical denaturants. These observations suggested that increased protein lability combined with modest defects in various inter-molecular interactions resulted in significant reductions in the thrombin-generating capacity of this FVIII variant.Although contacts between the A1 and C2 domains of FVIII appear to contribute to protein, and in particular heterodimer stability, little information is available on specific interactions and their functional significance. In this study, we examine the A1-C2 interface and explore approaches to potentially enhance the stability of this region through either covalent modification by nascent disulfide bridging or increasing its hydrophobic character. Results from this study show that an inter-domain disulfide can be constructed by replacement of selected residues with Cys and that the inter-domain affinity may also be enhanced by maximizing hydrophobic interactions. In both cases, the resultant FVIII variants demonstrate increased stability parameters, indicating that interactions at this interface are important for FVIII structural integrity.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigate interactions at the interface between FVIII A1 and C2 domains following preparation of two novel variants, R121C/L2302C FVIII, possessing a nascent disulfide bond spanning the domains, and A108I FVIII, which has a larger hydrophobic side chain to better fill the inter-domain space. Several other mutations were prepared at this region in an attempt to create a disulfide bond or to increase hydrophobicity. These variants yielded low specific activity values, possibly resulting from unfavorable changes in conformation, and their characterization was not pursued further. However, both variants studied exhibited enhanced inter-A1-C2 domain affinity resulting in increases in the observed stability of the FVIII variants, especially related to thermal denaturation.The intermediate resolution (∼4 Å) x-ray structure of FVIII (4Ngo J.C. Huang M. Roth D.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. Structure. 2008; 16: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) predicts the close proximity of Arg-121 and Leu-2302 with 7.7 Å separating Cα atoms (Protein Data Bank (PDB) number 3CDZ). This spatial separation suggested the potential to bridge this distance by a disulfide bond (∼4–6 Å) following replacement of these residues with Cys and provided that the side chains were in an acceptable orientation. Results evaluating the R121C/L2302C FVIII protein by Western blotting in the absence and presence of disulfide bond reduction showed high efficiency bridging (>90%) constituting experimental proof for the opposing orientation of side chains of these two residues in FVIII. In addition, the x-ray structure also showed that the A1-C2 junction adjacent to Ala-108 is rich in hydrophobic groups represented by the Cβ carbon of Ala-108 from the Cδ of Leu-2302, the Cβ of Ala-2328, or the Cγ of Gln-2329 (Fig. 1, lower panels). Thus, it is possible that extended alkyl groups of side chains larger than the methyl group of Ala might contribute to enhanced binding energy. Of several variants prepared to this region, replacement of Ala-108 with Ile yielded a variant possessing near WT-like specific activity.Both R121C/L2302C and A108I variants exhibited superior stability parameters as compared with the WT protein. For example, the thermal decay rates for the R121C/L2302C and A108I FVIII variants were reduced by 3.1- and 4.2-fold, respectively, as compared with WT. Further dissection of the interaction with the A108I variant was obtained following reconstitution of the A1/A3C1C2 dimer using WT and variant A1 subunits as well as the truncated A3C1 subunit derived from the C2 domain-deleted FVIII. We observed enhanced stability of the variant as compared with WT using native A3C1C2 but similar stability parameter values for variant and WT in the absence of the C2 domain. Taken together, these observations support the hypotheses that modulating the A1-C2 interface, through either covalent bridging or increased hydrophobic interaction, appeared to make an important contribution to overall protein stability.The primary cause for thermal decay of FVIII is attributed to dissociation of the heavy and light chains (15Ansong C. Fay P.J. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8850-8857Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This result is supported by the present study showing that bridging the FVIII heavy chain and light chain via a disulfide bond between A1 and C2 domains preferentially reduced thermal decay as compared with chemical denaturation. Thus, chemical denaturation appears to represent a more global effect on FVIII structure and a less specific effect for chain dissociation. We reported earlier that several residues at the A2-A3 interface (Tyr-1792, Tyr-1786, and Asp-666) possibly contributed to the binding energy only in the active FVIIIa form (21Wakabayashi H. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 11645-11651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Thus, interactions between the A2 domain of the heavy chain and A3C1C2 domains of the light chain may be minimal in the procofactor. Based upon that earlier study and the present study, we speculate that in the FVIII heterodimer, the predominant sources for binding energy likely derive from A1 interactions with both A3 and C2 domains.On the other hand, the instability of FVIIIa results from weak electrostatic interactions between the A2 subunit and the A1/A3C1C2 dimer (17Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and its dissociation leads to dampening of Factor Xase (FXase) activity (19Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Several FVIII point mutations have been shown to facilitate the rate of dissociation of A2 relative to WT, and these residues localize to either the A1-A2 domain interface (23Pipe S.W. Eickhorst A.N. McKinley S.H. Saenko E.L. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 176-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Pipe S.W. Saenko E.L. Eickhorst A.N. Kemball-Cook G. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or the A2-A3 domain interface (25Hakeos W.H. Miao H. Sirachainan N. Kemball-Cook G. Saenko E.L. Kaufman R.J. Pipe S.W. Thromb. Haemost. 2002; 88: 781-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that among several charged residues located at the interface between A1 and A2 domains or between A2 and A3 domains Asp-519, Glu-665, and Glu-1984 were found to be detrimental to FVIII/FVIIIa stability (20Wakabayashi H. Varfaj F. Deangelis J. Fay P.J. Blood. 2008; 112: 2761-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Wakabayashi H. Griffiths A.E. Fay P.J. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 7: 438-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Replacing the charged residues with Ala or Val yielded increased FVIII stability and in particular enhanced retention of the A2 subunit in FVIIIa. Interestingly, neither the single mutants nor combinations of these mutations yielded FVIII variants that showed reductions in the rate of thermal decay of greater than 2.3-fold, whereas the variants examined in the present study showed thermal decay rate reductions of 3–4-fold. Thus, the magnitude of stability enhancement we observed for the A1-C2 interface variants appeared somewhat larger than for the A2 domain-mediated interactions. However, although these variants clearly showed superior FVIII stability, results from this study indicated essentially little if any effect of the interactions involving the A1 and C2 domains in stabilizing the FVIIIa cofactor, suggesting no linkage of these sites with sites involved in A2 subunit retention.A1 domain residues 110–126 are in close contact to the C2 domain. These residues contain a Ca2+ binding site predicted by Ala-scanning mutagenesis (8Wakabayashi H. Freas J. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12677-12684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and subsequently identified in the x-ray crystal structure (3Shen B.W. Spiegel P.C. Chang C.H. Huh J.W.

Interestingly, preliminary experiments assessing chelation of Ca2+ (and/or Cu2+) in FVIII by EGTA yielded dramatic losses in activity of WT FVIII while showing more minimal effects on the activity of R121C/L2302C and A108I variants. 4H. Wakabayashi and P. J. Fay, unpublished observations. One possible explanation for these observations may be that the functional effects of Ca2+ occupancy at 110–126 in FVIII were replaced by enhanced stabilizing interactions between the A1 and C2 domains in the variants.In conclusion, results from this study demonstrate that interactions between the A1 and C2 domains of FVIII contribute to the integrity of the protein, providing significant energy for stabilizing the multidomain structure of FVIII. Furthermore, observations for enhancing FVIII stability, in particular by increasing non-covalent, hydrophobic interactions at the A1-C2 domain interface, suggest that these variants could potentially represent superior therapeutics in the treatment of hemophilia. IntroductionFactor F (FVIII) 2The abbreviations used are: FVIIIfactor VIIIFVIIIafactor VIIIaFIXafactor IXaFXfactor XFXaactivated factor XPCphosphatidylcholinePEphosphatidylethanolaminePSphosphatidylserine. is a plasma protein that is decreased or defective in individuals with hemophilia A. FVIII is expressed as both single chain and heterodimer forms in heterologous cells. The latter consists of a heavy chain composed of A1(a1)A2(a2)B domains and a light chain composed of (a3)A3C1C2 domains, with the lowercase “a” representing short segments rich in acidic residues (see Ref. 1Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar for review). FVIII is activated following limited proteolysis catalyzed by thrombin or FXa at Arg-372 (a1A2 junction), Arg-740 (a2B junction), and Arg-1689 (a3A3 junction). The resulting product, FVIIIa, is a heterotrimer composed of subunits designated A1, A2, and A3C1C2 that functions as a cofactor for FIXa in the membrane-dependent activation of FX to FXa (see Ref 1Fay P.J. Blood Rev. 2004; 18: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar for review).Earlier structural studies identified the C2 domain as making a primary contribution to anionic phospholipid membrane binding through a combination of electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (2Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). More recently, the intermediate resolution x-ray structures of FVIII (3Shen B.W. Spiegel P.C. Chang C.H. Huh J.W. Lee J.S. Kim J. Kim Y.H. Stoddard B.L.

In addition, these structures show close contact between A1 (heavy chain) and C2 (light chain) domains. We recently reported that an FVIII variant lacking the C2 domain retained the capacity to bind phospholipid membranes, albeit with a marked reduction in affinity (5Wakabayashi H. Griffiths A.E. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 25176-25184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), supporting a direct role for the C1 domain in this interaction. Furthermore, deletion of the C2 domain did not grossly alter a number of functional properties including the rate of procofactor activation by thrombin, affinity of FVIIIa for FIXa, Km of Factor Xase (FXase) for substrate FX, or kcat for FXa generation. However, this deletion did significantly destabilize the cofactor, as judged by increased rates of activity decay following exposure to elevated temperature or chemical denaturants. These observations suggested that increased protein lability combined with modest defects in various inter-molecular interactions resulted in significant reductions in the thrombin-generating capacity of this FVIII variant.Although contacts between the A1 and C2 domains of FVIII appear to contribute to protein, and in particular heterodimer stability, little information is available on specific interactions and their functional significance. In this study, we examine the A1-C2 interface and explore approaches to potentially enhance the stability of this region through either covalent modification by nascent disulfide bridging or increasing its hydrophobic character. Results from this study show that an inter-domain disulfide can be constructed by replacement of selected residues with Cys and that the inter-domain affinity may also be enhanced by maximizing hydrophobic interactions. In both cases, the resultant FVIII variants demonstrate increased stability parameters, indicating that interactions at this interface are important for FVIII structural integrity.

In both cases, the resultant FVIII variants demonstrate increased stability parameters, indicating that interactions at this interface are important for FVIII structural integrity. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we investigate interactions at the interface between FVIII A1 and C2 domains following preparation of two novel variants, R121C/L2302C FVIII, possessing a nascent disulfide bond spanning the domains, and A108I FVIII, which has a larger hydrophobic side chain to better fill the inter-domain space. Several other mutations were prepared at this region in an attempt to create a disulfide bond or to increase hydrophobicity. These variants yielded low specific activity values, possibly resulting from unfavorable changes in conformation, and their characterization was not pursued further. However, both variants studied exhibited enhanced inter-A1-C2 domain affinity resulting in increases in the observed stability of the FVIII variants, especially related to thermal denaturation.The intermediate resolution (∼4 Å) x-ray structure of FVIII (4Ngo J.C. Huang M. Roth D.A. Furie B.C. Furie B. Structure. 2008; 16: 597-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) predicts the close proximity of Arg-121 and Leu-2302 with 7.7 Å separating Cα atoms (Protein Data Bank (PDB) number 3CDZ). This spatial separation suggested the potential to bridge this distance by a disulfide bond (∼4–6 Å) following replacement of these residues with Cys and provided that the side chains were in an acceptable orientation. Results evaluating the R121C/L2302C FVIII protein by Western blotting in the absence and presence of disulfide bond reduction showed high efficiency bridging (>90%) constituting experimental proof for the opposing orientation of side chains of these two residues in FVIII. In addition, the x-ray structure also showed that the A1-C2 junction adjacent to Ala-108 is rich in hydrophobic groups represented by the Cβ carbon of Ala-108 from the Cδ of Leu-2302, the Cβ of Ala-2328, or the Cγ of Gln-2329 (Fig. 1, lower panels). Thus, it is possible that extended alkyl groups of side chains larger than the methyl group of Ala might contribute to enhanced binding energy. Of several variants prepared to this region, replacement of Ala-108 with Ile yielded a variant possessing near WT-like specific activity.Both R121C/L2302C and A108I variants exhibited superior stability parameters as compared with the WT protein. For example, the thermal decay rates for the R121C/L2302C and A108I FVIII variants were reduced by 3.1- and 4.2-fold, respectively, as compared with WT. Further dissection of the interaction with the A108I variant was obtained following reconstitution of the A1/A3C1C2 dimer using WT and variant A1 subunits as well as the truncated A3C1 subunit derived from the C2 domain-deleted FVIII. We observed enhanced stability of the variant as compared with WT using native A3C1C2 but similar stability parameter values for variant and WT in the absence of the C2 domain. Taken together, these observations support the hypotheses that modulating the A1-C2 interface, through either covalent bridging or increased hydrophobic interaction, appeared to make an important contribution to overall protein stability.The primary cause for thermal decay of FVIII is attributed to dissociation of the heavy and light chains (15Ansong C.

This result is supported by the present study showing that bridging the FVIII heavy chain and light chain via a disulfide bond between A1 and C2 domains preferentially reduced thermal decay as compared with chemical denaturation. Thus, chemical denaturation appears to represent a more global effect on FVIII structure and a less specific effect for chain dissociation.

Varfaj F. Deangelis J. Fay P.J. Blood. 2008; 112: 2761-2769Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 26Wakabayashi H. Griffiths A.E. Fay P.J. J. Thromb.

Replacing the charged residues with Ala or Val yielded increased FVIII stability and in particular enhanced retention of the A2 subunit in FVIIIa. Interestingly, neither the single mutants nor combinations of these mutations yielded FVIII variants that showed reductions in the rate of thermal decay of greater than 2.3-fold, whereas the variants examined in the present study showed thermal decay rate reductions of 3–4-fold. Thus, the magnitude of stability enhancement we observed for the A1-C2 interface variants appeared somewhat larger than for the A2 domain-mediated interactions. However, although these variants clearly showed superior FVIII stability, results from this study indicated essentially little if any effect of the interactions involving the A1 and C2 domains in stabilizing the FVIIIa cofactor, suggesting no linkage of these sites with sites involved in A2 subunit retention. A1 domain residues 110–126 are in close contact to the C2 domain. These residues contain a Ca2+ binding site predicted by Ala-scanning mutagenesis (8Wakabayashi H. Freas J. Zhou Q. Fay P.J. J. Biol.

Interestingly, preliminary experiments assessing chelation of Ca2+ (and/or Cu2+) in FVIII by EGTA yielded dramatic losses in activity of WT FVIII while showing more minimal effects on the activity of R121C/L2302C and A108I variants. 4H. Wakabayashi and P. J. Fay, unpublished observations. One possible explanation for these observations may be that the functional effects of Ca2+ occupancy at 110–126 in FVIII were replaced by enhanced stabilizing interactions between the A1 and C2 domains in the variants. In conclusion, results from this study demonstrate that interactions between the A1 and C2 domains of FVIII contribute to the integrity of the protein, providing significant energy for stabilizing the multidomain structure of FVIII. Furthermore, observations for enhancing FVIII stability, in particular by increasing non-covalent, hydrophobic interactions at the A1-C2 domain interface, suggest that these variants could potentially represent superior therapeutics in the treatment of hemophilia.

https://openalex.org/W1986065708,"Glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) accelerates glycosphingolipid (GSL) intermembrane transfer via a unique lipid transfer/binding fold (GLTP-fold) that defines the GLTP superfamily and is the prototype for GLTP-like domains in larger proteins, i.e. phosphoinositol 4-phosphate adaptor protein-2 (FAPP2). Although GLTP-folds are known to play roles in the nonvesicular intracellular trafficking of glycolipids, their ability to alter cell phenotype remains unexplored. In the present study, overexpression of human glycolipid transfer protein (GLTP) was found to dramatically alter cell phenotype, with cells becoming round between 24 and 48 h after transfection. By 48 h post transfection, ∼70% conversion to the markedly round shape was evident in HeLa and HEK-293 cells, but not in A549 cells. In contrast, overexpression of W96A-GLTP, a liganding-site point mutant with abrogated ability to transfer glycolipid, did not alter cell shape. The round adherent cells exhibited diminished motility in wound healing assays and an inability to endocytose cholera toxin but remained viable and showed little increase in apoptosis as assessed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage. A round cell phenotype also was induced by overexpression of FAPP2, which binds/transfers glycolipid via its C-terminal GLTP-like fold, but not by a plant GLTP ortholog (ACD11), which is incapable of glycolipid binding/transfer. Screening for human protein partners of GLTP by yeast two hybrid screening and by immuno-pulldown analyses revealed regulation of the GLTP-induced cell rounding response by interaction with δ-catenin. Remarkably, while δ-catenin overexpression alone induced dendritic outgrowths, coexpression of GLTP along with δ-catenin accelerated transition to the rounded phenotype. The findings represent the first known phenotypic changes triggered by GLTP overexpression and regulated by direct interaction with a p120-catenin protein family member."
https://openalex.org/W2162524444,"Evolutionary relationships among organisms are commonly described by using a hierarchy derived from comparisons of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences. We propose that even on the level of a single rRNA molecule, an organism's evolution is composed of multiple pathways due to concurrent forces that act independently upon different rRNA degrees of freedom. Relationships among organisms are then compositions of coexisting pathway-dependent similarities and dissimilarities, which cannot be described by a single hierarchy. We computationally test this hypothesis in comparative analyses of 16S and 23S rRNA sequence alignments by using a tensor decomposition, i.e., a framework for modeling composite data. Each alignment is encoded in a cuboid, i.e., a third-order tensor, where nucleotides, positions and organisms, each represent a degree of freedom. A tensor mode-1 higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) is formulated such that it separates each cuboid into combinations of patterns of nucleotide frequency variation across organisms and positions, i.e., “eigenpositions” and corresponding nucleotide-specific segments of “eigenorganisms,” respectively, independent of a-priori knowledge of the taxonomic groups or rRNA structures. We find, in support of our hypothesis that, first, the significant eigenpositions reveal multiple similarities and dissimilarities among the taxonomic groups. Second, the corresponding eigenorganisms identify insertions or deletions of nucleotides exclusively conserved within the corresponding groups, that map out entire substructures and are enriched in adenosines, unpaired in the rRNA secondary structure, that participate in tertiary structure interactions. This demonstrates that structural motifs involved in rRNA folding and function are evolutionary degrees of freedom. Third, two previously unknown coexisting subgenic relationships between Microsporidia and Archaea are revealed in both the 16S and 23S rRNA alignments, a convergence and a divergence, conferred by insertions and deletions of these motifs, which cannot be described by a single hierarchy. This shows that mode-1 HOSVD modeling of rRNA alignments might be used to computationally predict evolutionary mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2003616191,"Endocytosis controls localization-specific signal transduction via epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), as well as downregulation of that receptor. Extracellular matrix (ECM)-integrin coupling induces formation of macromolecular complexes that include EGFR, integrin, Src kinase and p130Cas, resulting in EGFR activation. In addition, cell adhesion to ECM increases EGFR localization at the cell surface and reduces EGFR internalization. The molecular mechanisms involved are not yet well understood.We investigated the molecular mechanism by which p130Cas affects the endocytic regulation of EGFR. Biochemical quantification revealed that cell adhesion to fibronectin (FN) increases total EGFR levels and its phosphorylation, and that p130Cas is required for this process. Measurements of Texas Red-labeled EGF uptake and cell surface EGFR revealed that p130Cas overexpression reduces EGF-induced EGFR internalization, while p130Cas depletion enhances it. In addition, both FN-mediated cell adhesion and p130Cas overexpression reduce EGF-stimulated dynamin phosphorylation, which is necessary for EGF-induced EGFR internalization. Coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays confirmed the interaction between p130Cas and dynamin. Moreover, a SH3-domain-deleted form of p130Cas, which shows diminished binding to dynamin, inhibits dynamin phosphorylation and EGF uptake less effectively than wild-type p130Cas.Our results show that p130Cas plays an inhibitory role in EGFR internalization via its interaction with dynamin. Given that the EGFR internalization process determines signaling density and specificity in the EGFR pathway, these findings suggest that the interaction between p130Cas and dynamin may regulate EGFR trafficking and signaling in the same manner as other endocytic regulatory proteins related to EGFR endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2016130154,"Calpain proteases drive intracellular signal transduction via specific proteolysis of multiple substrates upon Ca(2+)-induced activation. Recently, dUTPase, an enzyme essential to maintain genomic integrity, was identified as a physiological calpain substrate in Drosophila cells. Here we investigate the potential structural/functional significance of calpain-activated proteolysis of human dUTPase.Limited proteolysis of human dUTPase by mammalian m-calpain was investigated in the presence and absence of cognate ligands of either calpain or dUTPase. Significant proteolysis was observed only in the presence of Ca(II) ions, inducing calpain action. The presence or absence of the dUTP-analogue α,β-imido-dUTP did not show any effect on Ca(2+)-calpain-induced cleavage of human dUTPase. The catalytic rate constant of dUTPase was unaffected by calpain cleavage. Gel electrophoretic analysis showed that Ca(2+)-calpain-induced cleavage of human dUTPase resulted in several distinctly observable dUTPase fragments. Mass spectrometric identification of the calpain-cleaved fragments identified three calpain cleavage sites (between residues (4)SE(5); (7)TP(8); and (31)LS(32)). The cleavage between the (31)LS(32) peptide bond specifically removes the flexible N-terminal nuclear localization signal, indispensable for cognate localization.Results argue for a mechanism where Ca(2+)-calpain may regulate nuclear availability and degradation of dUTPase."
https://openalex.org/W2111835780,"Only a portion of the estimated heritability of breast cancer susceptibility has been explained by individual loci. Comparative genetic approaches that first use an experimental organism to map susceptibility QTLs are unbiased methods to identify human orthologs to target in human population-based genetic association studies. Here, overlapping rat mammary carcinoma susceptibility (Mcs) predicted QTLs, Mcs6 and Mcs2, were physically confirmed and mapped to identify the human orthologous region. To physically confirm Mcs6 and Mcs2, congenic lines were established using the Wistar-Furth (WF) rat strain, which is susceptible to developing mammary carcinomas, as the recipient (genetic background) and either Wistar-Kyoto (WKy, Mcs6) or Copenhagen (COP, Mcs2), which are resistant, as donor strains. By comparing Mcs phenotypes of WF.WKy congenic lines with distinct segments of WKy chromosome 7 we physically confirmed and mapped Mcs6 to ∼33 Mb between markers D7Rat171 and gUwm64-3. The predicted Mcs2 QTL was also physically confirmed using segments of COP chromosome 7 introgressed into a susceptible WF background. The Mcs6 and Mcs2 overlapping genomic regions contain multiple annotated genes, but none have a clear or well established link to breast cancer susceptibility. Igf1 and Socs2 are two of multiple potential candidate genes in Mcs6. The human genomic region orthologous to rat Mcs6 is on chromosome 12 from base positions 71,270,266 to 105,502,699. This region has not shown a genome-wide significant association to breast cancer risk in pun studies of breast cancer susceptibility."
https://openalex.org/W1992365519,"The Sac10b protein family is regarded as a group of nucleic acid-binding proteins that are highly conserved and widely distributed within archaea. All reported members of this family are basic proteins that exist as homodimers in solution and bind to DNA and/or RNA without apparent sequence specificity in vitro. Here, we reported a unique member of the family, Mth10b from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ΔH, whose amino acid sequence shares high homology with other Sac10b family proteins. However, unlike those proteins, Mth10b is an acidic protein; its potential isoelectric point is only 4.56, which is inconsistent with the characteristics of a nucleic acid-binding protein. In this study, Mth10b was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using a three-column chromatography purification procedure. Biochemical characterization indicated that Mth10b should be similar to typical Sac10b family proteins with respect to its secondary and tertiary structure and in its preferred oligomeric forms. However, an electrophoretic mobility shift analysis (EMSA) showed that neither DNA nor RNA bound to Mth10b in vitro, indicating that either Mth10b likely has a physiological function that is distinct from those of other Sac10b family members or nucleic acid-binding ability may not be a fundamental factor to the actual function of the Sac10b family."
