https://openalex.org/W2052568700,"An internal or external electric field F can drive the chemical structure, bond order alternation, and electronic structure of linear polymethine dyes from a neutral, bond-alternated, polyene-like structure, through a cyanine-like structure, and ultimately to a zwitterionic (charge-separated) bond-alternated structure. As the structure evolves under the influence of F, the linear polarizability alpha, the first hyperpolarizability beta, and the second hyperpolarizability gamma are seen to be derivatives, with respect to F, of their next lower order polarization (for alpha) or polarizability (for beta and gamma). These derivative relations provide a unified picture of the dependence of the polarizability and hyperpolarizabilities on the structure in linear polymethine dyes. In addition, they allow for predictions of structure-property relations of higher order hyperpolarizabilities."
https://openalex.org/W2043179375,"The derivation of a marine gravity field from satellite altimetry over permanently ice-covered regions of the Arctic Ocean provides much new geophysical information about the structure and development of the Arctic sea floor. The Arctic Ocean, because of its remote location and perpetual ice cover, remains from a tectonic point of view the most poorly understood ocean basin on Earth. A gravity field has been derived with data from the ERS-1 radar altimeter, including permanently ice-covered regions. The gravity field described here clearly delineates sections of the Arctic Basin margin along with the tips of the Lomonosov and Arctic mid-ocean ridges. Several important tectonic features of the Amerasia Basin are clearly expressed in this gravity field. These include the Mendeleev Ridge; the Northwind Ridge; details of the Chukchi Borderland; and a north-south trending, linear feature in the middle of the Canada Basin that apparently represents an extinct spreading center that ""died"" in the Mesozoic. Some tectonic models of the Canada Basin have proposed such a failed spreading center, but its actual existence and location were heretofore unknown."

The temperature field is influenced by seasonal radiative forcing, and its banded organization is closely correlated with the visible cloud field. Evidence was found for a quasi-periodic oscillation of temperatures in the Equatorial Zone, a correlation between tropospheric and stratospheric waves in the North Equatorial Belt, and slowly moving thermal features in the North and South Equatorial Belts. There appears to be no common relation between temporal changes of temperature and changes in the visual albedo of the various axisymmetric bands."
