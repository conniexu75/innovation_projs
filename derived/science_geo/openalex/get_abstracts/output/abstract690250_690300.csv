https://openalex.org/W4220759112,"Optoelectronic devices consist of heterointerfaces formed between dissimilar semiconducting materials. The relative energy-level alignment between contacting semiconductors determinately affects the heterointerface charge injection and extraction dynamics. For perovskite solar cells (PSCs), the heterointerface between the top perovskite surface and a charge-transporting material is often treated for defect passivation1-4 to improve the PSC stability and performance. However, such surface treatments can also affect the heterointerface energetics1. Here we show that surface treatments may induce a negative work function shift (that is, more n-type), which activates halide migration to aggravate PSC instability. Therefore, despite the beneficial effects of surface passivation, this detrimental side effect limits the maximum stability improvement attainable for PSCs treated in this way. This trade-off between the beneficial and detrimental effects should guide further work on improving PSC stability via surface treatments."
https://openalex.org/W4220765071,"While CRISPR screens are helping uncover genes regulating many cell-intrinsic processes, existing approaches are suboptimal for identifying extracellular gene functions, particularly in the tissue context. Here, we developed an approach for spatial functional genomics called Perturb-map. We applied Perturb-map to knock out dozens of genes in parallel in a mouse model of lung cancer and simultaneously assessed how each knockout influenced tumor growth, histopathology, and immune composition. Moreover, we paired Perturb-map and spatial transcriptomics for unbiased analysis of CRISPR-edited tumors. We found that in Tgfbr2 knockout tumors, the tumor microenvironment (TME) was converted to a fibro-mucinous state, and T cells excluded, concomitant with upregulated TGFβ and TGFβ-mediated fibroblast activation, indicating that TGFβ-receptor loss on cancer cells increased TGFβ bioavailability and its immunosuppressive effects on the TME. These studies establish Perturb-map for functional genomics within the tissue at single-cell resolution with spatial architecture preserved and provide insight into how TGFβ responsiveness of cancer cells can affect the TME."
https://openalex.org/W4220965395,"Abstract Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) are emerging small noncoding RNAs that, although commonly altered in cancer, have poorly defined roles in tumorigenesis 1 . Here we show that pseudouridylation (Ψ) of a stem cell-enriched tRF subtype 2 , mini tRFs containing a 5′ terminal oligoguanine (mTOG), selectively inhibits aberrant protein synthesis programmes, thereby promoting engraftment and differentiation of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Building on evidence that mTOG-Ψ targets polyadenylate-binding protein cytoplasmic 1 (PABPC1), we employed isotope exchange proteomics to reveal critical interactions between mTOG and functional RNA-recognition motif (RRM) domains of PABPC1. Mechanistically, this hinders the recruitment of translational co-activator PABPC1-interacting protein 1 (PAIP1) 3 and strongly represses the translation of transcripts sharing pyrimidine-enriched sequences (PES) at the 5′ untranslated region (UTR), including 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine tracts (TOP) that encode protein machinery components and are frequently altered in cancer 4 . Significantly, mTOG dysregulation leads to aberrantly increased translation of 5′ PES messenger RNA (mRNA) in malignant MDS-HSPCs and is clinically associated with leukaemic transformation and reduced patient survival. These findings define a critical role for tRFs and Ψ in difficult-to-treat subsets of MDS characterized by high risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)."
https://openalex.org/W4221048469,"The tumor micro-environment often contains stiff and irregular-bundled collagen fibers that are used by tumor cells to disseminate. It is still unclear how and to what extent, extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness versus ECM bundle size and alignment dictate cancer cell invasion. Here, we have uncoupled Collagen-I bundling from stiffness by introducing inter-collagen crosslinks, combined with temperature induced aggregation of collagen bundling. Using organotypic models from mouse invasive ductal and invasive lobular breast cancers, we show that increased collagen bundling in 3D induces a generic increase in breast cancer invasion that is independent of migration mode. However, systemic collagen stiffening using advanced glycation end product (AGE) crosslinking prevents collective invasion, while leaving single cell invasion unaffected. Collective invasion into collagen matrices by ductal breast cancer cells depends on Lysyl oxidase-like 3 (Loxl3), a factor produced by tumor cells that reinforces local collagen stiffness. Finally, we present clinical evidence that collectively invading cancer cells at the invasive front of ductal breast carcinoma upregulate LOXL3. By uncoupling the mechanical, chemical, and structural cues that control invasion of breast cancer in three dimensions, our data reveal that spatial control over stiffness and bundling underlie collective dissemination of ductal-type breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W4221002098,"Topographic maps, the systematic spatial ordering of neurons by response tuning, are common across species. In Drosophila, the lobula columnar (LC) neuron types project from the optic lobe to the central brain, where each forms a glomerulus in a distinct position. However, the advantages of this glomerular arrangement are unclear. Here, we examine the functional and spatial relationships of 10 glomeruli using single-neuron calcium imaging. We discover novel detectors for objects smaller than the lens resolution (LC18) and for complex line motion (LC25). We find that glomeruli are spatially clustered by selectivity for looming versus drifting object motion and ordered by size tuning to form a topographic visual feature map. Furthermore, connectome analysis shows that downstream neurons integrate from sparse subsets of possible glomeruli combinations, which are biased for glomeruli encoding similar features. LC neurons are thus an explicit example of distinct feature detectors topographically organized to facilitate downstream circuit integration."
https://openalex.org/W4220854419,"Proliferation is a fundamental trait of cancer cells, but its properties and spatial organization in tumours are poorly characterized. Here we use highly multiplexed tissue imaging to perform single-cell quantification of cell cycle regulators and then develop robust, multivariate, proliferation metrics. Across diverse cancers, proliferative architecture is organized at two spatial scales: large domains, and smaller niches enriched for specific immune lineages. Some tumour cells express cell cycle regulators in the (canonical) patterns expected of freely growing cells, a phenomenon we refer to as 'cell cycle coherence'. By contrast, the cell cycles of other tumour cell populations are skewed towards specific phases or exhibit non-canonical (incoherent) marker combinations. Coherence varies across space, with changes in oncogene activity and therapeutic intervention, and is associated with aggressive tumour behaviour. Thus, multivariate measures from high-plex tissue images capture clinically significant features of cancer proliferation, a fundamental step in enabling more precise use of anti-cancer therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4220744107,"Burnout is a work-related stress syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Nurse burnout is related to nurses' deteriorating mental health and poorer patient care quality and thus, is a significant concern in healthcare. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has swept the world and distressed the healthcare systems. Because of the body's stress mechanism, it is vital to examine the current prevalence of nurse burnout and understand it at a biological level, using an epigenetic biomarker, telomere length.To determine the prevalence of burnout among nurses in the Peri-Operative and Labor & Delivery settings pre and during the COVID-19 pandemic and to examine the effects of burnout on absolute telomere length.This is a cross-sectional study assessing the prevalence of nurses' burnout and the relationships between nurses' burnout and telomere length. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to stop the study during the mid of data collection. Even though the study was not designed to capture changes before and during the pandemic, we analyzed two groups' data before and during the pandemic. The study took place in a US hospital. Nurses in the hospital's Operating Room, Post-Anesthesia Care Unit, and Labor & Delivery Unit participated in the study. Maslach Burnout Inventory survey and nurses' demographics were administered online. Telomere length was measured via finger-prick blood.146 nurses participated in the study, with 120 participants' blood samples collected. The high-level burnout rate was 70.5%. Correlation analysis did not reveal a direct correlation between nurse burnout and telomere length. However, in a multiple regression analysis, the final model contained the burnout subscale of emotional exhaustion, years as an RN, and work unit's nursing care quality. There was a low degree of departure from normality of the mean absolute telomere length in the pre-pandemic group and a substantial degree of departure in the during-pandemic group.Nurse burnout is a prevalent phenomenon in healthcare, and this study indicates that nurses currently experience high levels of burnout. Nurses' cellular biomarker, telomere length, is shorter in the group of nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. Appropriate measures should be implemented to decrease nurses' burnout symptoms and improve nurses' psychological and physical health. Nurses, especially those younger than 60, report higher burnout symptoms, particularly emotional exhaustion. This study indicates the need for intervention to promote nurses' health during the pandemic and beyond. If not appropriately managed, nurse burnout may continue to be a significant issue facing the healthcare system."
https://openalex.org/W4220851249,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) originates from normal pancreatic ducts where digestive juice is regularly produced. It remains unclear how PDAC can escape autodigestion by digestive enzymes. Here we show that human PDAC tumour cells use gasdermin E (GSDME), a pore-forming protein, to mediate digestive resistance. GSDME facilitates the tumour cells to express mucin 1 and mucin 13, which form a barrier to prevent chymotrypsin-mediated destruction. Inoculation of GSDME-/- PDAC cells results in subcutaneous but not orthotopic tumour formation in mice. Inhibition or knockout of mucin 1 or mucin 13 abrogates orthotopic PDAC growth in NOD-SCID mice. Mechanistically, GSDME interacts with and transports YBX1 into the nucleus where YBX1 directly promotes mucin expression. This GSDME-YBX1-mucin axis is also confirmed in patients with PDAC. These findings uncover a unique survival mechanism of PDAC cells in pancreatic microenvironments."
https://openalex.org/W4221124038,"To identify the experiences and concerns of health workers (HWs), and how they changed, throughout the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK.Longitudinal, qualitative study with HWs involved in patient management or delivery of care related to COVID-19 in general practice, emergency departments and hospitals. Participants were identified through snowballing. Semi-structured telephone or video interviews were conducted between February 2020 and February 2021, audio-recorded, summarised, and transcribed. Data were analysed longitudinally using framework and thematic analysis.We conducted 105 interviews with 14 participants and identified three phases corresponding with shifts in HWs' experiences and concerns. (1) Emergency and mobilisation phase (late winter-spring 2020), with significant rapid shifts in responsibilities, required skills, and training, and challenges in patient care. (2) Consolidation and preparation phase (summer-autumn 2020), involving gradual return to usual care and responsibilities, sense of professional development and improvement in care, and focus on learning and preparing for future. (3) Exhaustion and survival phase (autumn 2020-winter 2021), entailing return of changes in responsibilities, focus on balancing COVID-19 and non-COVID care (until becoming overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases), and concerns about longer-term impacts of unceasing pressure on health services. Participants' perceptions of COVID-19 risk and patient/public attitudes changed throughout the year, and tiredness and weariness turned into exhaustion.Results showed a long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on UK HWs' experiences and concerns related to changes in their roles, provision of care, and personal wellbeing. Despite mobilisation in the emergency phase, and trying to learn from this, HWs' experiences seemed to be similar or worse in the second wave partly due to many COVID-19 cases. The findings highlight the importance of supporting HWs and strengthening system-level resilience (e.g., with resources, processes) to enable them to respond to current and future demands and emergencies."
https://openalex.org/W4226146766,"Agaricus bisporus is widely consumed on the world market. The easy browning of mushroom surface is one of the most intuitive factors affecting consumer purchase. A certain cognition on browning mechanism has been made after years of research. At present, people slow down the browning of mushrooms mainly by improving preservation methods. In addition, breeding is also a reliable way. In the production practice, we have identified some browning-resistant varieties, and we selected a browning-resistant variety to compare with an ordinary variety to reveal the resistance mechanism. Using transcriptomics and metabolomics, the differences in gene expression and metabolite levels were revealed, respectively. The results showed that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) like AbPPO4 , AbPPO3 and AbPPO2 were differently expressed and these DEGs were involved in many pathways related to browning. The expression of AbPPO expression play an important role in the browning of A . bisporus and multiple PPO family members are involved in the regulation of browning. However, the resistance to browning cannot be judged only by the expression level of AbPPOs . For metabolomics, most of the different metabolites were organic acids. These organic acids had a higher level in anti-browning (BT) than easy-browning varieties (BS), although the profile was very heterogeneous. On the contrary, the content of trehalose in BS was significantly higher than that in BT. Higher organic acids decreased pH and further inhibited PPO activity. In addition, the BS had a higher content of trehalose, which might play roles in maintaining PPO activity. The difference of browning resistance between BS and BT is mainly due to the differential regulation mechanism of PPO."
https://openalex.org/W4220963905,"Increasing evidences indicate that gut microbiota composition is associated with multiple inflammatory diseases. However, little is known about how gut microbiota changes with age and correlations with gut inflammation at sexual maturity stage of healthy individuals. Elucidating the dynamic changes of gut microbiota in healthy individuals at the sexual maturity stage and correlations with gut inflammation can provide clues for early risk assessment of gut diseases at the sexual maturity stage. Here, the shift in gut bacteria and its relationship with gut inflammation at the sexual maturity stage were explored. Sprague-Dawley rats at the sexual maturity stage were used in this study. 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed to decipher gut bacteria shifts from the 7th week to the 9th week, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure gut inflammation and gut barrier permeability. We found an increase in bacterial richness with age and a decrease in bacterial diversity with age. The gut bacteria were primarily dominated by the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroides and the genus Prevotella. The relative abundance of Firmicutes increased with age, and the relative abundance of Bacteroides decreased with age. There was a positive correlation between body weight and the Firmicutes:Bacteroides ratio. More and more gut microbiota participated in the host gut inflammation and barrier permeability regulation with age. Ruminococcus was the only gut bacteria participated in gut inflammation and barrier permeability regulation both in the 7th week and the 15th week. These results provide a better understanding of the relationship between gut bacteria and gut inflammation in sexually mature rats and show that Ruminococcus may be a potential indicator for early risk assessment of gut inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4220890678,"Combination therapy represents an effective therapeutic approach to overcome hepatocellular cancer (HCC) resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Based upon previous work demonstrating that nanoliposome C6-ceramide (LipC6) not only induces HCC apoptosis but also prevents HCC-induced immune tolerance, we now investigate the potential of LipC6 in combination with ICB in HCC treatment. We generated orthotopic HCC-bearing mice, which have typical features in common with human patients, and then treated them with LipC6 in combination with the antibodies (Abs) for programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA4). The tumor growth was monitored by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the intrahepatic immune profiles were checked by flow cytometry in response to the treatments. Realtime PCR (qPCR) was used to detect the expression of target genes. The results show that LipC6 in combination with anti-CTLA4 Ab, but not anti-PD-1 Ab, significantly slowed tumor growth, enhanced tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, and suppressed tumor-resident CD4+ CD25+ FoxP3+ Tregs. Further molecular investigation indicates that the combinational treatment suppressed transcriptional factor Krüppel-like Factor 2 (KLF2), forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3), and CTLA4. Our studies suggest that LipC6 in combination with anti-CTLA4 Ab represents a novel therapeutic approach with significant potential in activating anti-HCC immune response and suppressing HCC growth."
https://openalex.org/W4220902861,"The mitochondrial F1Fo ATP synthase of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei has been previously studied in detail. This unusual enzyme switches direction in functionality during the life cycle of the parasite, acting as an ATP synthase in the insect stages, and as an ATPase to generate mitochondrial membrane potential in the mammalian bloodstream stages. Whereas the trypanosome F1 moiety is relatively highly conserved in structure and composition, the Fo subcomplex and the peripheral stalk have been shown to be more variable. Interestingly, a core subunit of the latter, the normally conserved subunit b, has been resistant to identification by sequence alignment or biochemical methods. Here, we identified a 17 kDa mitochondrial protein of the inner membrane, Tb927.8.3070, that is essential for normal growth, efficient oxidative phosphorylation, and membrane potential maintenance. Pull-down experiments and native PAGE analysis indicated that the protein is both associated with the F1Fo ATP synthase and integral to its assembly. In addition, its knockdown reduced the levels of Fo subunits, but not those of F1, and disturbed the cell cycle. Finally, analysis of structural homology using the HHpred algorithm showed that this protein has structural similarities to Fo subunit b of other species, indicating that this subunit may be a highly diverged form of the elusive subunit b."
https://openalex.org/W4220825585,"Carbohydrate-active enzymes are involved in the degradation, biosynthesis, and modification of carbohydrates and vary with the diversity of carbohydrates. The glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 31 is one of the most diverse families of carbohydrate-active enzymes, containing various enzymes that act on α-glycosides. However, the function of some GH31 groups remains unknown, as their enzymatic activity is difficult to estimate due to the low amino acid sequence similarity between characterized and uncharacterized members. Here, we performed a phylogenetic analysis and discovered a protein cluster (GH31_u1) sharing low sequence similarity with the reported GH31 enzymes. Within this cluster, we showed that a GH31_u1 protein from Lactococcus lactis (LlGH31_u1) and its fungal homolog demonstrated hydrolytic activities against nigerose [α-D-Glcp-(1→3)-D-Glc]. The kcat/Km values of LlGH31_u1 against kojibiose and maltose were 13% and 2.1% of that against nigerose, indicating that LlGH31_u1 has a higher specificity to the α-1,3 linkage of nigerose than other characterized GH31 enzymes, including eukaryotic enzymes. Furthermore, the three-dimensional structures of LlGH31_u1 determined using X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy revealed that LlGH31_u1 forms a hexamer and has a C-terminal domain comprising four α-helices, suggesting that it contributes to hexamerization. Finally, crystal structures in complex with nigerooligosaccharides and kojibiose along with mutational analysis revealed the active site residues involved in substrate recognition in this enzyme. This study reports the first structure of a bacterial GH31 α-1,3-glucosidase and provides new insight into the substrate specificity of GH31 enzymes and the physiological functions of bacterial and fungal GH31_u1 members."
https://openalex.org/W4220881386,"Crack is the external expression form of potential safety risks in bridge construction. Currently, automatic detection and segmentation of bridge cracks remains the top priority of civil engineers. With the development of image segmentation techniques based on convolutional neural networks, new opportunities emerge in bridge crack detection. Traditional bridge crack detection methods are vulnerable to complex background and small cracks, which is difficult to achieve effective segmentation. This study presents a bridge crack segmentation method based on a densely connected U-Net network (BC-DUnet) with a background elimination module and cross-attention mechanism. First, a dense connected feature extraction model (DCFEM) integrating the advantages of DenseNet is proposed, which can effectively enhance the main feature information of small cracks. Second, the background elimination module (BEM) is proposed, which can filter the excess information by assigning different weights to retain the main feature information of the crack. Finally, a cross-attention mechanism (CAM) is proposed to enhance the capture of long-term dependent information and further improve the pixel-level representation of the model. Finally, 98.18% of the Pixel Accuracy was obtained by comparing experiments with traditional networks such as FCN and Unet, and the IOU value was increased by 14.12% and 4.04% over FCN and Unet, respectively. In our non-traditional networks such as HU-ResNet and F U N-4s, SAM-DUnet has better and higher accuracy and generalization is not prone to overfitting. The BC-DUnet network proposed here can eliminate the influence of complex background on the segmentation accuracy of bridge cracks, improve the detection efficiency of bridge cracks, reduce the detection cost, and have practical application value."
https://openalex.org/W4226051947,"In view of the high infection rate of Helicobacter pylori, a safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed. Recent trends in vaccine design have shifted toward safe and specific epitope-based vaccines. In this study, by using different immunoinformatics approaches, a total of eight linear B cell epitopes, four HTL and three CTL epitopes of FlaA and UreB proteins of H. pylori G27 strain were screened out, we also predicted the conformational epitopes of the two proteins. Then, the dominant epitopes were sequentially linked by appropriate linkers, and the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 extracellular domain was attached to the N-terminal of the epitope sequence. Meanwhile, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and principal component analysis were performed to show that the multi-epitope vaccine structure had strong interactions with B7 (B7-1, B7-2) and Toll-like receptors (TLR-2, -4). Eventually, the effectiveness of the vaccine was validated using in silico cloning. These analyses suggested that the designed vaccine could target antigen-presenting cells and had high potency against H. pylori, which could provide a reference for the future development of efficient H. pylori vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W4220856627,"Successful recall of a contextual memory requires reactivating ensembles of hippocampal cells that were allocated during memory formation. Altering the ratio of excitation-to-inhibition (E/I) during memory retrieval can bias cell participation in an ensemble and hinder memory recall. In the case of Rett syndrome (RTT), a neurological disorder with severe learning and memory deficits, the E/I balance is altered, but the source of this imbalance is unknown. Using in vivo imaging during an associative memory task, we show that during long-term memory retrieval, RTT CA1 cells poorly distinguish mnemonic context and form larger ensembles than wild-type mouse cells. Simultaneous multiple whole-cell recordings revealed that mutant somatostatin expressing interneurons (SOM) are poorly recruited by CA1 pyramidal cells and are less active during long-term memory retrieval in vivo. Chemogenetic manipulation revealed that reduced SOM activity underlies poor long-term memory recall. Our findings reveal a disrupted recurrent CA1 circuit contributing to RTT memory impairment."
https://openalex.org/W4220957437,"Despite the established efficacy of PrEP to prevent HIV and the advantages of a user-controlled method, PrEP uptake and persistence by women in both trials and demonstration projects has been suboptimal. We utilized real-world data from an HIV service provider to describe persistence on oral PrEP among female sex workers (FSW) in eThekwini, South Africa.We examined time from PrEP initiation to discontinuation among all FSW initiating PrEP at TB HIV Care in eThekwini between 2016-2020. We used a discrete time-to-event data setup and stacked cumulative incidence function plots, displaying the competing risks of 1) not returning for PrEP, 2) client discontinuation, and 3) provider discontinuation. We calculated hazard ratios using complementary log-log regression and sub-hazard ratios using competing risks regression.The number of initiations increased each year from 155 (9.3%, n = 155/1659) in 2016 to 1224 (27.5%, n = 1224/4446) in 2020. Persistence 1-month after initiation was 53% (95% CI: 51%-55%). Younger women were more likely to discontinue PrEP by not returning compared with those 25 years and older. Risk of discontinuation through non-return declined for those initiating in later years. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, a greater number of initiations and sustained persistence were observed in 2020.Low levels of PrEP persistence were observed, consistent with data among underserved women elsewhere. Encouragingly, the proportion of women persisting increased over time, even as the number of women newly initiating PrEP and staff workload increased. Further research is needed to understand which implementation strategies the program may have enacted to facilitate these improvements and what further changes may be necessary."
https://openalex.org/W4220968891,"Several measures have been designed to assess subjective experiences induced by psychedelic substances or other mind-altering drugs as well as non-pharmacological methods. Recently, two self-report questionnaires have been introduced to measure acute adverse effects following psilocybin ingestion and the phenomenon of ego-dissolution associated with the use of psychedelics, respectively. The 26-item Challenging Experience Questionnaire assesses multiple facets of psilocybin induced experiences on seven subscales, whereas the 8-item Ego-Dissolution Inventory consists of a unidimensional scale. In the present study, these questionnaires were translated into German and their psychometric properties then evaluated in an online survey on psychedelics induced experiences. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested an acceptable fit of the 7-factor structure of the German Challenging Experience Questionnaire with overall good internal consistency for all subscales. The factor structure did not differ based on gender or prior struggle with a psychiatric disorder, furthering the evidence of internal validity. Correlations with the State-Trait-Anxiety Inventory and the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale demonstrated convergent validity. Confirmatory factor analysis did not support the hypothesized single-factor structure of the German Ego-Dissolution Inventory and exploratory factor analysis suggested an alternative factor structure, where only five items loaded onto a common factor that was interpreted as ego-dissolution. Internal consistency of this 5-item measure was high and correlation with selected items of the Mystical Experience Questionnaire and Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale supported convergent validity. Translation and validation of these questionnaires contribute to the advancement of common standards in the psychological and neuroscientific study of altered states of consciousness."
https://openalex.org/W4225595175,"Effects of feeding male rats during spermatogenesis a high-fat, high-sucrose and high-salt diet (HFSSD) over two generations (F0 and F1) on renal outcomes are unknown. Male F0 and F1 rats were fed either control diet (F0CD+F1CD) or HFSSD (F0HD+F1HD). The outcomes were glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin excretion in F1 and F2 offspring. If both outcomes were altered a morphological and molecular assessment was done. F2 offspring of both sexes had a decreased GFR. However, increased urinary albumin excretion was only observed in female F2 F0HD+F1HD offspring compared with controls. F0HD+F1HD female F2 offspring developed glomerulosclerosis (+31%; p < .01) and increased renal interstitial fibrosis (+52%; p < .05). RNA sequencing followed by qRT-PCR validation showed that four genes (Enpp6, Tmem144, Cd300lf, and Actr3b) were differentially regulated in the kidneys of female F2 offspring. lncRNA XR-146683.1 expression decreased in female F0HD+F1HD F2 offspring and its expression was (r = 0.44, p = .027) correlated with the expression of Tmem144. Methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the Cd300lf gene was increased (p = .001) in female F2 F0HD+F1HD offspring compared to controls. Promoter CpG island methylation rate of Cd300lf was inversely correlated with Cd300lf mRNA expression in F2 female offspring (r = −0.483, p = .012). Cd300lf mRNA expression was inversely correlated with the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio in female F2 offspring (r = −0.588, p = .005). Paternal pre-conceptional unhealthy diet given for two generations predispose female F2 offspring to chronic kidney disease due to epigenetic alterations of renal gene expression. Particularly, Cd300lf gene promotor methylation was inversely associated with Cd300lf mRNA expression and Cd300lf mRNA expression itself was inversely associated with urinary albumin excretion in F2 female offspring whose fathers and grandfathers got a pre-conceptional unhealthy diet."
https://openalex.org/W4221003035,"This preliminary clinical investigation of the pharmacokinetic behavior of the main metamizole (dipyrone) metabolites 4-methylaminoantipyrine (4-MAA) and 4-aminoantipyrine (4-AA) in calves undergoing umbilical surgery is part of an already published main study. A single intravenous dose of metamizole was added to ketamine/xylazine/isoflurane anesthesia. Eight Simmental calves weighing 90 ± 10.8 kg and aged 47.6 ± 10.4 days received 40 mg/kg metamizole intravenously 10 minutes prior to general anesthesia. Blood samples were collected over 24 hours and analyzed for 4-MAA and 4-AA. Meloxicam was additionally given twice: 2.5 hours pre- and 20.5 hours postsurgically. The pharmacokinetic profile of 4-MAA was best fitted to a two-compartment model and was characterized by a fast distribution half-life and slow elimination half-life (t½alpha = 5.29 minutes, t½beta = 9.49 hours). The maximum concentration (Cmax 101.63 μg/mL) was detected at the first measurement time point 15 minutes after administration. In contrast, 4-AA showed fast, high and biphasic plasma peak concentration behavior in five calves (2.54-2.66 μg/mL after 15-30 minutes, and 2.10-2.14 μg/mL after 2-3.5 hours) with a t½beta of 8.87 hours, indicating a rapid distribution and subsequent redistribution from well-perfused organs. Alternatively, three calves exhibited a slower and lower monophasic plasma peak concentration (1.66 μg/mL after 6.5 hours) with a t½beta of 6.23 hours, indicating slow accumulation in the intravascular compartment. The maximum concentration and area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of 4-AA were lower than those of 4-MAA. This metabolic behavior supports our already published data on clinical monitoring and plasma cortisol concentrations (PCCs). Compared to those of saline controls, lower PCCs correspond to the t½alpha of 4-MAA. Data on Tmax and t½beta also match these clinical observations. However, further studies are required to assess the exact analgesic mechanism and potency of the metamizole metabolites in calves."
https://openalex.org/W4220726198,"RRM2 plays an important role in different malignant tumors, but there are few studies in breast cancer. Public databases were used to analyze the expression of RRM2 in breast cancer and its prognostic value.A total of 2,509 breast cancer samples were downloaded from the METABRIC database. The relationship between RRM2 expression and clinical pathology was evaluated. Using the BCIP database and real-time-PCR, and western blotting, RRM2 mRNA and protein expression of RRM2 in breast cancer tissues and cell lines were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analysis defined independent prognostic factors that affected the overall survival of patients with breast cancer. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to study the relationship between the high expression of RRM2 and overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) of breast cancer patients. Finally, We performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and obtained the relevant pathways associated with high expression of RRM2 potentially influencing breast cancer progression.RRM2 expression was significantly correlated with age, tumor size, grade, menopausal status, molecular typing, ER, PR, and Her-2 of patients with breast cancer(P<0.05). Univariate and multivariate regression analysis showed that RRM2, the number of positive lymph nodes, ER, Her-2, tumor size, and tumor stage can be used as independent prognostic factors for overall survival of patients with breast cancer. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that in patients with Luminal A and Normal like breast cancers and Stage1 and stage2 breast cancers, patients with high expression of RRM2 had worse overall survival and DMFS. The analysis of the GSEA pathway showed that RRM2 is mainly enriched in the ERBB signaling pathway and other pathways.The high expression of RRM2 has a worse prognosis in patients with breast cancer with specific features. It can be used as a biomarker for the prognosis of breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4220758840,"As explorations deepen, the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), from its emergence to metastasis and prognosis, has elicited extensive concern. LUSC-related miRNA and mRNA samples were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The data were initially screened and pretreated, and the R platform and series analytical tools were used to identify the specific and sensitive biomarkers. Seven miRNAs and 15 hub genes were found to be closely related to the overall survival of patients with LUSC. Determination of the expression of these miRNAs can help improve the overall survival of LUSC patients. The 15 hub genes correlated with overall survival (OS). The new miRNA markers were identified to predict the prognosis of LUSC. The findings of this study offer novel views on the evolution of precise cancer treatment approaches with high reliability."
https://openalex.org/W4220858198,"Cells have developed diverse mechanisms to monitor changes in their surroundings. This allows them to establish effective responses to cope with adverse environments. Some of these mechanisms have been well characterized in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an excellent experimental model to explore and elucidate some of the strategies selected in eukaryotic organisms to adjust their growth and development in stressful conditions. The relevance of structural disorder in proteins and the impact on their functions has been uncovered for proteins participating in different processes. This is the case of some transcription factors (TFs) and other signaling hub proteins, where intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) play a critical role in their function. In this work, we present a comprehensive bioinformatic analysis to evaluate the significance of structural disorder in those TFs (170) recognized in S. cerevisiae. Our findings show that 85.2% of these TFs contain at least one IDR, whereas ~30% exhibit a higher disorder level and thus were considered as intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). We also found that TFs contain a higher number of IDRs compared to the rest of the yeast proteins, and that intrinsically disordered TFs (IDTFs) have a higher number of protein-protein interactions than those with low structural disorder. The analysis of different stress response pathways showed a high content of structural disorder not only in TFs but also in other signaling proteins. The propensity of yeast proteome to undergo a liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) was also analyzed, showing that a significant proportion of IDTFs may undergo this phenomenon. Our analysis is a starting point for future research on the importance of structural disorder in yeast stress responses."

Here we report the first record of Aedes albopictus in the territory of the Republic of Kosovo. The first finding, in July 2020, was driven by a photo of an adult mosquito published by a citizen in social media. The subsequent field investigation in July 2020 confirmed the presence of adult mosquitoes by human landing catch and collection of eggs in ovitraps at the village Zhur. Monitoring was performed for 7 weeks with ovitraps and BG-Sentinel adult traps at 36 sampling stations from 7 localities, in the Southern part of Kosovo, on the border with Albania. Fifty-two out of 81 ovitrap samples resulted positive for the presence of Ae. albopictus. A total of 2,711 eggs are collected in 22 out 36 stations and a total of 78 adults from 4 out 4 stations with BG Sentinel trap and 15 adults with handled electric aspirator. Our finding shows that the tiger mosquito is expanding its geographical range in the Balkans, southeastern Europe."
https://openalex.org/W4220689067,"In mammals, behavioral activity is regulated both by the circadian system, orchestrated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and by arousal structures, including the serotonergic system. While the SCN is active at the same astronomical time in diurnal and nocturnal species, little data are available concerning the serotonergic (5HT) system in diurnal mammals. In this study, we investigated the functioning of the 5HT system, which is involved both in regulating the sleep/wake cycle and in synchronizing the SCN, in a diurnal rodent, Arvicanthis ansorgei. Using in situ hybridization, we characterized the anatomical extension of the raphe nuclei and we investigated 24 h mRNA levels of the serotonin rate-limiting enzyme, tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (tph2). Under both 12 h:12 h light/dark (LD) and constant darkness (DD) conditions, tph2 mRNA expression varies significantly over 24 h, displaying a bimodal profile with higher values around the (projected) light transitions. Furthermore, we considered several SCN outputs, namely melatonin, corticosterone, and locomotor activity. In both LD and DD, melatonin profiles display peak levels during the biological night. Corticosterone plasma levels show a bimodal rhythmic profile in both conditions, with higher levels preceding the two peaks of Arvicanthis locomotor activity, occurring at dawn and dusk. These data demonstrate that serotonin synthesis in Arvicanthis is rhythmic and reflects its bimodal behavioral phenotype, but differs from what has been previously described in nocturnal species."
https://openalex.org/W4220701501,"Despite growing concerns about the addictive potential of social networking sites (SNSs), little is known about the precise neural, cognitive, and emotional processes underpinning compulsive SNS behaviours, such as excessive checking of SNSs. Recent evidence points to the important role of reward in SNS behaviours and one avenue to examine reward processes related to SNSs is the use of behavioural paradigms that allow for the measurement of implicit motivational responses, such as the approach avoidance task (AAT). The AAT has been successfully utilised to capture changes in unconscious reward processes in substance use disorders and other behavioural addictions, with faster approach reactions to addiction-related stimuli reflecting increased wanting/urges to have/consume the reward. In the present study 411 young adults completed an online Visual Approach/Avoidance by the Self Task (VAAST) with social media and control logos as well as other subjective (explicit) measures of reward experience related to SNSs. Our results showed that across participants SNS logos elicited strong approach reactions (compared to control stimuli) and that stronger SNS approach tendencies predicted more frequent SNS checking. Importantly, increased approach motivation was not associated with more problematic use. However, both checking frequency and problematic use were related to alterations of explicit reward processing, including the subjective experience of SNS urges or wanting. We conclude that changes in automatic approach motivation towards SNS stimuli are common in most SNS users, which suggests that implicit imbuement of social media with reward has become pervasive among young adults. Problematic SNS use however may be more reliably indicated by changes in explicit reward processing, such as subjective wanting."
https://openalex.org/W4220730084,"The assessment of supportive care needs and fear of cancer progression are important variables to be considered when evaluating the psychological aspects of cancer patients. However, data on how these variables affect posttraumatic growth (PTG) are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the level of PTG among head and neck cancer (HNC) patients within the first year of cancer diagnosis and to determine the association between unmet supportive care needs, fear of cancer progression, and the level of PTG.Participants were administered socio-demographic and clinical characteristics questionnaire; the 34-item Supportive Care Needs Survey (SCNS-34) to measure the unmet needs; 12-item Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form (FoP-Q-SF) to measure the fear of progression of cancer; and the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory-Short Form (PTGI-SF) to measure the degree of PTG.A total of 190 HNC participants reported a mean total PTGI-SF score of 39.3 (standard deviation = 9.5). General linear model revealed that higher degree of patients' physical and daily living unmet needs and fear of cancer progression significantly predicted lower PTG, after controlling for sociodemographic and clinical factors.HNC patients within the first year of cancer diagnosis reported a high level of PTG. Despite that, psychosocial intervention for HNC patients should emphasize on counteracting patients' physical and daily living unmet needs and fear of cancer progression to improve the psychological well-being of patients."
https://openalex.org/W4220764743,"Overwhelming inflammation in the setting of acute critical illness induces capillary leak resulting in hypovolemia, edema, tissue dysoxia, organ failure and even death. The tight junction (TJ)-dependent capillary barrier is regulated by small GTPases, but the specific regulatory molecules most active in this vascular segment under such circumstances are not well described. We set out to identify GTPase regulatory molecules specific to endothelial cells (EC) that form TJs. Transcriptional profiling of confluent monolayers of TJ-forming human dermal microvascular ECs (HDMECs) and adherens junction only forming-human umbilical vein EC (HUVECs) demonstrate ARHGEF12 is basally expressed at higher levels and is only downregulated in HDMECs by junction-disrupting tumor necrosis factor (TNF). HDMECs depleted of ArhGEF12 by siRNA demonstrate a significantly exacerbated TNF-induced decrease in trans-endothelial electrical resistance and disruption of TJ continuous staining. ArhGEF12 is established as a RhoA-GEF in HUVECs and its knock down would be expected to reduce RhoA activity and barrier disruption. Pulldown of active GEFs from HDMECs depleted of ArhGEF12 and treated with TNF show decreased GTP-bound Rap1A after four hours but increased GTP-bound RhoA after 12 h. In cell-free assays, ArhGEF12 immunoprecipitated from HDMECs is able to activate both Rap1A and RhoA, but not act on Rap2A-C, RhoB-C, or even Rap1B which shares 95% sequence identity with Rap1A. We conclude that in TJ-forming HDMECs, ArhGEF12 selectively activates Rap1A to limit capillary barrier disruption in a mechanism independent of cAMP-mediated Epac1 activation."
https://openalex.org/W4220845387,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is recognized as the liver component of metabolic syndrome. The regulation of hepatic lipid should be emphasized to prevent accompanying illness. As AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) regulate lipid metabolism, CD36 and fatty acid synthase (FAS) promote lipid uptake and lipogenesis respectively, while acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) is an indicator of negative feedback. The increase of IRS-1 phosphorylation at the residue ser307 (p-ser307-IRS-1) and decrease of p-ser473-Akt (p-Akt) are viewed as the insulin resistance markers, and our previous reports suggested dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) mediates insulin resistance, the crucial factor of metabolic syndrome. Abelmoschus esculentus (AE) fruit is well-known for its antidiabetic utility. We had isolated several AE subfractions by successive steps, and found that F1 and F2 were especially valid in suppressing DPP-4 signaling. Since little is known if AE works on NAFLD, now we first attempt to investigate whether AE is useful to attenuate hepatic lipogenesis and lipid uptake in liver cells, along with improving the metabolic targets. We demonstrated that AE subfractions attenuated the hepatic lipid accumulation induced by free fatty acids. Treatment of AE alleviated FAS and returned the level of p-ser79-ACC (p-ACC). Although F1 was more effective on AMPK, F2 seemed more stable to attenuate SREBP-1. Moreover, as fatty acids stimulated the expression of CD36, F2 showed a superior effect to down-regulate the lipid uptake. Both AE subfractions reduced the generation of ROS, decreased the level of p-ser307-IRS-1, and restored the expression of p-Akt. Moreover, treatment of DPP-4 inhibitor linagliptin revealed that, AE could prevent the hepatic lipogenesis, oxidative burden, and the related insulin resistance via downregulating DPP-4. In conclusion, the present investigation revealed that AE, especially F2, is potential to be developed as adjuvant to prevent NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W4220872431,"This study consisted of the physicochemical, phytochemical and antioxidant characterisation of two varieties of Hibiscus sabdariffa, to evaluate the influence of genetic and environmental factors on these parameters leading to an objective and rigorous classification of our extracts. To this end, calyxes and seeds of the red and white phenotypes were collected in Bobo-Dioulasso, Dano and Nouna respectively in December 2019 and 2020. Principal component analysis showed that physico-chemical and biochemical parameters could potentially be used to discriminate varieties. The calyxes of the sabdariffa variety showed the best physicochemical profile (total phenolics, flavonoids, ascorbic acid), pigments (anthocyanins, chlorophyll) and antioxidant activity (free radical scavenging and SOD activity) while the seeds showed the best carbohydrate, lipid and peroxidation inhibition content. In view of these results, the red phenotype has an interesting nutritional and therapeutic potential. It could therefore be interesting candidate in the pharmaceutical and food industries."
https://openalex.org/W4220879055,"Climate change and invasive species threaten many ecosystems, including surface freshwater systems. Increasing temperatures and reduced hydroperiod due to climate change may promote the persistence of invasive species and facilitate new invasions due to potentially higher tolerance to environmental stress in successful invaders. Amphibians demonstrate high levels of plasticity in life history characteristics, particularly those species which inhabit both ephemeral and permanent water bodies. We tested the influence of two projected effects of climate change (increased temperature and reduced hydroperiod) on Pacific chorus frog ( Pseudacris regilla ) tadpoles alone and in combination with the presence of tadpoles of a wide-spread invasive amphibian, the American bullfrog ( Lithobates catesbeianus ). Specifically, we explored the effects of projected climate change and invasion on survival, growth, mass at stage 42, and development rate of Pacific chorus frogs. Direct and indirect interactions between the invasive tadpole and the native tadpole were controlled via a cage treatment and were included to account for differences in presence of the bullfrog compared to competition for food resources and other direct effects. Overall, bullfrogs had larger negative effects on Pacific chorus frogs than climate conditions. Under future climate conditions, Pacific chorus frogs developed faster and emerged heavier. Pacific chorus frog tadpoles developing in the presence of American bullfrogs, regardless of cage treatment, emerged lighter. When future climate conditions and presence of invasive American bullfrog tadpoles were combined, tadpoles grew less. However, no interaction was detected between climate conditions and bullfrog presence for mass, suggesting that tadpoles allocated energy towards mass rather than length under the combined stress treatment. The maintenance of overall body condition (smaller but heavier metamorphs) when future climate conditions overlap with bullfrog presence suggests that Pacific chorus frogs may be partially compensating for the negative effects of bullfrogs via increased allocation of energy towards mass. Strong plasticity, as demonstrated by Pacific chorus frog larvae in our study, may allow species to match the demands of new environments, including under future climate change."
https://openalex.org/W4220904011,"Objective Striae gravidarum (SG) and perineal lacerations are common occurrences during late pregnancy and labor. It has been hypothesized that both conditions may share a common pathophysiological pathway through changes in the connective tissue. We aimed to investigate a possible association between these two conditions and whether the presence of SG may predict perineal lacerations. Methods We conducted a prospective cohort study that included women who gave birth at the Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC), Beer-Sheva, Israel. Those who provided informed consent were examined for the presence of SG using the Davey scoring system to determine the severity of abdominal SG. Clinical and obstetrical characteristics and the presence and degree of perineal tears were retrieved from the computerized patients’ records. Univariate analysis was carried using appropriate statistical tests. Results A total of 187 women were recruited. Of those, 81 (43.3%) did not have SG, 24 (12.8%) 43 (23%) and 39 (20.9%) had mild, moderate and severe SG, respectively. Women with SG were significantly older and had a higher body mass index (p&lt;0.01 for both). Delivery characteristics, mode of delivery, and gestational age were comparable between the groups; however, women with SG gave birth to significantly larger neonates (p&lt;0.01). Seventy-one (31%) women had suffered from 1 st or 2 nd -degree perineal tears, and none had 3 rd or 4 th -degree perineal tears. No significant differences were found in rates of perineal tears between women with and without SG (p = 0.91), regardless of SG severity (p = 0.38). Conclusions In our study, SG was not associated with perineal tears. This information may be used as reassurance when giving antepartum consultation to women with SG, even in severe cases."
https://openalex.org/W4220993010,"In humans, the nc886 locus is a polymorphically imprinted metastable epiallele. Periconceptional conditions have an effect on the methylation status of nc886, and further, this methylation status is associated with health outcomes in later life, in line with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. Animal models would offer opportunities to study the associations between periconceptional conditions, nc886 methylation status and metabolic phenotypes further. Thus, we set out to investigate the methylation pattern of the nc886 locus in non-human mammals.We obtained DNA methylation data from the data repository GEO for mammals, whose nc886 gene included all three major parts of nc886 and had sequency similarity of over 80% with the human nc886. Our final sample set consisted of DNA methylation data from humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutangs, baboons, macaques, vervets, marmosets and guinea pigs.In human data sets the methylation pattern of nc886 locus followed the expected bimodal distribution, indicative of polymorphic imprinting. In great apes, we identified a unimodal DNA methylation pattern with 50% methylation level in all individuals and in all subspecies. In Old World monkeys, the between individual variation was greater and methylation on average was close to 60%. In guinea pigs the region around the nc886 homologue was non-methylated. Results obtained from the sequence comparison of the CTCF binding sites flanking the nc886 gene support the results on the DNA methylation data.Our results indicate that unlike in humans, nc886 is not a polymorphically imprinted metastable epiallele in non-human primates or in guinea pigs, thus implying that animal models are not applicable for nc886 research. The obtained data suggests that the nc886 region may be classically imprinted in great apes, and potentially also in Old World monkeys, but not in guinea pigs."
https://openalex.org/W4221039378,"China is the world’s largest importer of agricultural products. Stability of agricultural imports directly affects domestic food availability, and hence influences national food security. This study is important to gauge effects of uncertainty resulting from global and domestic economic policy changes on the stability component of food security in China. Though many studies have explored the determinants and consequences of Chinese agricultural trade, research focusing on stability of agricultural imports is lacking. To fill the gap, this study calculates duration length and survival probability of China’s agri-food imports, and estimates effects of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on the stability. Results show that trade duration of the agri-food imports is 12.07 months in China. However, 51.69% of disrupted trade relationships would resume after 2 months and 92.68% of temporarily interrupted trade relationships return to the market after 12 months. Empirical estimations show that global EPU has a larger impact on the stability of agricultural imports than Chinese EPU. Although Chinese EPU has heterogeneous effects on imports of different agri-food products in China, global EPU does not. Stabilized domestic food price and improved domestic agricultural productivity would improve stability of the imports significantly. The study concludes that China’s agricultural imports are less dynamic than previous studies claimed. However, EPU significantly erodes the trade stability. To offset negative effects of EPU on the stability, government should pay more attention on stabilizing domestic food price volatility and increasing food productivity, and therefore improve food security in China."
https://openalex.org/W4221040288,"Differentiated service delivery (DSD) offers benefits to people living with HIV (improved access, peer support), and the health system (clinic decongestion, efficient service delivery). ART clubs, 15-30 clients who usually meet within the community, are one of the most common DSD options. However, evidence about the quality of care (QoC) delivered in ART clubs is still limited.We conducted a concurrent triangulation mixed-methods study as part of the Test & Treat project in northwest Tanzania. We surveyed QoC among stable clients and health care workers (HCW) comparing between clinics and clubs. Using a Donabedian framework we structured the analysis into three levels of assessment: structure (staff, equipment, supplies, venue), processes (time-spent, screenings, information, HCW-attitude), and outcomes (viral load, CD4 count, retention, self-worth).We surveyed 629 clients (40% in club) and conducted eight focus group discussions, while 24 HCW (25% in club) were surveyed and 22 individual interviews were conducted. Quantitative results revealed that in terms of structure, clubs fared better than clinics except for perceived adequacy of service delivery venue (94.4% vs 50.0%, p = 0.013). For processes, time spent receiving care was significantly more in clinics than clubs (119.9 vs 49.9 minutes). Regarding outcomes, retention was higher in the clubs (97.6% vs 100%), while the proportion of clients with recent viral load <50 copies/ml was higher in clinics (100% vs 94.4%). Qualitative results indicated that quality care was perceived similarly among clients in clinics and clubs but for different reasons. Clinics were generally perceived as places with expertise and clubs as efficient places with peer support and empathy. In describing QoC, HCW emphasized structure-related attributes while clients focused on processes. Outcomes-related themes such as improved client health status, self-worth, and confidentiality were similarly perceived across clients and HCW.We found better structure and process of care in clubs than clinics with comparable outcomes. While QoC was perceived similarly in clinics and clubs, its meaning was understood differently between clients. DSD catered to the individual needs of clients, either technical care in the clinic or proximate and social care in the club. Our findings highlight that both clinic and DSD care are required as many elements of QoC were individually perceived."
https://openalex.org/W4220729468,"This study aimed to identify factors that can influence show-jumping performance during top level competitions in the Western European League (2017/2018, CSI5*). The performance data of 144 riders and 222 horses were obtained from video records (FEI TV/ website). Riders with horses achieved a total of 9114 jumping-efforts over 320 obstacles including oxers (n = 142), oxers with water (n = 15), triple bars (n = 6), verticals (n = 136), verticals with water (n = 14) and walls (n = 7). Obstacles in the first round (FR) or in jump off (JO) were standing either as single (n = 6290) or as a combination of two or three fences in a row (n = 2824). The overall fault rate (dropping the pole or refusal/run-out to jump) was 7.85%. The probability of a fault increased with the rank of the fence in the course of FR (F (1, 7649) = 5.29, P < 0.0001, GzLMM; PROC GLIMMIX, SAS). The highest probability of a fault (F (5, 7649) = 2.51, P < 0.03) in FR was found on the vertical obstacle with water (0.125 ± 0.021, LSMEAN ± standard error) while the lowest was on the triple bar (0.037 ± 0.015) and wall (0.048 ± 0.020). Riders who completed more starts in previous competitions achieved a lower fault rate (F (1, 7649) = 6.17, P < 0.02) in FR as well as in JO (F (1, 931) = 7.05, P < 0.01). The probability of faults in JO decreased with a higher speed (F (1, 931) = 6.66, P < 0.01) but there was no significant correlation between the speed in JO and FR in individual horses (r = 0.26, P < 0.01). More faults were found on the fences within combinations in both rounds (FR, JO). The highest probability of faults was found on the first fence (FR 0.095 ± 0.016; JO 0.043 ± 0.008) or second fence (JO 0.055 ± 0.020) of the double combination compared to the least probability of faults on single obstacles (FR 0.057 ± 0.007, F (5, 7649) = 5.29, P < 0.0001; JO 0.100 ± 0.027, F (1, 931) = 3.39, P < 0.04). Other tested factors did not affect show-jumping performance. Some faults are still more likely and not random in a show-jumping course, therefore, the appropriate training focus can improve performance and safety in competitions."

Out of sixty-five male volunteers, forty-six, forty-eight, and fifty athletes (18-35 years; black- and red-belt level) were included in the final analysis for aerobic, anaerobic, and agility assessments, respectively. Maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max, using a graded exercise test on a treadmill), anaerobic power (using the 30-s Wingate anaerobic test, WAnT), and agility performance (using the agility T-Test) were measured via non-specific laboratory and field tests across a two-week period. The taekwondo-specific aerobic-anaerobic-agility (TAAA) test comprised six 20-s intervals of shuttle sprints over a 4-m distance, and the execution of roundhouse kicks alternating the legs at the end of each distance, with 10-s rest intervals between the sets. The multiple linear regression revealed that the difference between heart rate (HR) after and 1 minute after the TAAA test (p < 0.001), and body mass index (BMI; p = 0.006) were significant to estimate VO2max. Likewise, there was a very large (R = 0.79) and large (R = 0.55) correlation between the average and maximum number of kicks performed in the TAAA test and the WAnT mean and peak power, respectively (p < 0.001). Moreover, a linear relationship was found between the T-Test and agility performance acquired in the TAAA test (R = 0.74; p < 0.001). The TAAA test can be considered a valid simple tool for monitoring VO2max, anaerobic fitness, and agility in male taekwondo athletes."
https://openalex.org/W4220999088,"When humanity confronts the risk of extinction of species, many people invoke precautions, especially in the face of uncertainty. Although precautionary approaches are value judgments, the optimal design and effect of precautions or lack thereof are scientific questions. We investigated Wisconsin gray wolves Canis lupus facing a second wolf-hunt in November 2021 and use three legal thresholds as the societal value judgments about precautions: (1) the 1999 population goal, 350 wolves, (2) the threshold for statutory listing under the state threatened and endangered species act, 250 wolves; and (3) state extirpation <2 wolves. This allows us to explore the quantitative relationship between precaution and uncertainty. Working from estimates of the size wolf population in April 2021 and reproduction to November, we constructed a simple linear model with uninformative priors for the period April 2021-April 2022 including an uncertain wolf-hunt in November 2021. Our first result is that the state government under-counted wolf deaths in the year preceding both wolf-hunts. We recommend better scientific analysis be used when setting wolf-hunt quotas. We find official recommendations for a quota for the November 2021 wolf-hunt risk undesirable outcomes. Even a quota of zero has a 13% chance of crossing threshold 1. Therefore, a zero death toll would be precautionary. Proponents for high quotas bear the burden of proof that their estimates are accurate, precise, and reproducible. We discuss why our approach is transferable to non-wolves. We show how scientists have the tools and concepts for quantifying and explaining the probabilities of crossing thresholds set by laws or other social norms. We recommend that scientists grapple with data gaps by explaining what the uncertainty means for policy and the public including the consequences of being wrong."

A sample of this blood was aliquoted for performance of the ISI, and patients were followed for clinical outcomes. The study required no patient-centered activity beyond standard of care and treating clinicians were unaware of study enrollment and ISI test results.282 patients were included. The ISI ranges 0.1 to 10.0, with three interpretation bands indicating risk of adverse outcome: low (green), 0.1-4.9; intermediate (yellow), 5.0-6.2; and high (red), 6.3-10.0. Of 193 (68.4%) tested for SARS-CoV-2, 96 (49.7%) were positive. The ISI resulted in 182 (64.5%) green, 54 (18.1%) yellow, and 46 (15.6%) red band patients. Green band patients had a 1.1% (n = 2) 3-day mortality, while yellow and red band had 3.7% (n = 2, p > .05) and 10.9% (n = 5, p < .05) 3-day mortalities, respectively. Fewer green band patients required admission (96 [52.7%]) vs yellow (44 [81.5%]) and red (43 [93.5%]). Green band patients had more hospital free days (median 23 (Q1-Q3 20-25) than yellow (median 22 [Q1-Q3 0-23], p < 0.05) and red (median 21 [Q1-Q3 0-24], p < 0.01).

https://openalex.org/W4221020484,"Few studies have characterized the microbial community and metabolite profile of solid food waste fermented products from centralized treatment facilities, which could potentially be processed into safe animal feeds. In this study, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and liquid/gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were conducted to investigate the bacterial community structure and metabolite profile of food waste samples inoculated with or without 0.18% of a commercial bacterial agent consisting of multiple unknown strains and 2% of a laboratory-made bacterial agent consisting of Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and Candida utilis. Our findings indicated that microbial inoculation increased the crude protein content of food waste while reducing the pH value, increasing lactic acid production, and enhancing aerobic stability. Microbial inoculation affected the community richness, community diversity, and the microbiota structure (the genera with abundances above 1.5% in the fermentation products included Lactobacillus (82.28%) and Leuconostoc (1.88%) in the uninoculated group, Lactobacillus (91.85%) and Acetobacter (2.01%) in the group inoculated with commercial bacterial agents, and Lactobacillus (37.11%) and Enterococcus (53.81%) in the group inoculated with homemade laboratory agents). Microbial inoculation reduced the abundance of potentially pathogenic bacteria. In the metabolome, a total of 929 substances were detected, 853 by LC-MS and 76 by GC-MS. Our results indicated that inoculation increased the abundance of many beneficial metabolites and aroma-conferring substances but also increased the abundance of undesirable odors and some harmful compounds such as phenol. Correlation analyses suggested that Leuconostoc, Lactococcus, and Weissella would be promising candidates to improve the quality of fermentation products. Taken together, these results indicated that inoculation could improve food waste quality to some extent; however, additional studies are required to optimize the selection of inoculation agents."
https://openalex.org/W4221104093,"Introduction Migraine is a disabling, recurrent headache disorder with complex comorbidities. Conventional treatments for migraine are unsatisfactory, with side effects and limited effectiveness. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has been used as an alternative or complementary treatment option for migraine in China. Currently, the existing evidence of benefit of CHM for migraine has been generated from randomised clinical trials using standardised intervention with a focus on internal validity hence with limited external validity. Moreover, CHM individualised intervention design, patients’ preferences and concerns, and clinicians’ experience are critical to clinical decision making and therapeutic success. This real-world observational study aims to gather practice-based evidence of effects and safety of CHM for migraine in the context of integrating Chinese medicine diagnostic procedures, patients’ preferences and matters relevant to clinical decision making. Methods and analysis The study is being undertaken at the Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine (GPHCM) from December 2020 to May 2022. We anticipate that approximately 400 adult migraineurs will be enrolled and observed on their migraine severity, analgesic consumption, quality of life, anxiety, depression and insomnia at baseline and then every four weeks over 12 weeks. Treatments, diagnostic information, and patient-reported most bothersome symptoms will be collected from patient clinical records. Patient’s demographic data, preferences and concerns on CHM treatments will also be gathered at baseline and be analysed. Factors related to clinical outcomes will be explored with multiple correlation and multivariable regression analyses. Effects of CHM will be evaluated using generalised estimated equation, based on clinical outcome data. Discussion This study will provide comprehensive evidence of CHM for migraine in the context of evidence-based practice. Trial registration number ChiCTR2000041003"

After adjusting for patient clinical risk factors, we calculated risk-adjusted rate of perioperative MRI use for each physician network in 2004-2005, 2006-2007, and 2008-2009, respectively. Based on the risk-adjusted rate, we identified three distinct trajectories of adopting perioperative MRI among physician networks: 1) low adoption (risk-adjusted rate of perioperative MRI increased from 2.8% in 2004-2005 to 14.8% in 2008-2009), 2) medium adoption (8.8% to 45.1%), and 3) high adoption (33.0% to 71.7%). Physician networks in the higher adoption trajectory tended to have a larger proportion of cancer specialists, more patients with high income, and fewer patients who were Black. After adjusting for patients' clinical risk factors, the proportion of patients undergoing mastectomy decreased from 41.1% in 2004-2005 to 38.5% in 2008-2009 among those in physician networks with low MRI adoption, but increased from 27.0% to 31.4% among those in physician networks with high MRI adoption (p = 0.03 for the interaction term between trajectory group and time).Physician patient-sharing networks varied in their trajectory of adopting perioperative MRI. These distinct trajectories were associated with the composition of patients and providers in the networks, and had important implications for patterns of mastectomy use."

https://openalex.org/W4220703060,"Sitagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor that is used orally in conjunction with diet and exercise to control sugar levels in type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients. This study aimed to extemporaneously prepare SiP solution (1% w/v) using pure Sitagliptin phosphate (SiP) powder and assess its stability according to pharmaceutical regulatory guidelines. Four SiP solutions, coded T1, T2, T3, and T4, were extemporaneously prepared using pure SiP powder as a source of API. The most suitable one, in terms of general organoleptic properties, was selected for further investigations, including stability studies. For this last purpose, samples of the T4 solution were kept under two storage conditions, room temperature (25˚C and 60% Relative Humidity) and accelerated stability conditions (40˚C and 75% Relative Humidity). Assay, pH, organoleptic properties, related substances, and microbial contamination were evaluated for 4 consecutive weeks. A High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analytical method was developed and validated to be used for the analysis and quantification of SiP in selected solution formulation. The adopted formula had a pH on the average of 3 to 4. During the stability tests, all pH values remained constant. Furthermore, after 4 weeks of storage under both conditions, the SiP concentration was close to 100%. A stable SiP extemporaneous solution was successfully prepared using pure SiP powder. Patients with swallowing problems who use feeding tubes and are unable to take oral solid dosage forms may benefit from this research. Community pharmacists can prepare the solution using sitagliptin powder as the source of the active ingredient."
https://openalex.org/W4220822603,"The wide usage of 3D mesh models greatly increases the importance of an effective matching algorithm for them. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D model matching algorithm. Firstly, vertices on the input 3D mesh models are mapped to 1D space by employing Isomap. A pose-invariant feature set is then constructed from the vertices in 1D space. Finally, the similarity between any two 3D models can be computed by comparing their feature sets. Experimental results show that the algorithm is not only invariant to translation, rotation, scaling, but also invariant to different poses of 3D models. Additionally, the algorithm is robust to noise."

https://openalex.org/W4221105363,"Background In South Asian countries, adolescent girls are generally embedded in multigenerational households. Nevertheless, public health research continues to focus on the nuclear family and overlook the role of grandmothers in adolescent socialization and the transfer of health information. This study compares family planning knowledge of adolescent girls in households with and without a resident grandmother. Two main types of family planning knowledge were assessed: (1) modern contraceptive knowledge and (2) healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy knowledge. Methods This study is a secondary data analysis of the 2017 Suaahara II cross-sectional survey in 16 of Nepal’s 77 districts. Family planning knowledge among 769 adolescent girls was assessed and compared between those living with a grandmother (n = 330) and those not living with a grandmother (n = 439). An analysis of the relationship between co-residence and family planning knowledge was carried out using multivariate logistic regression, adjusting for potential confounders and clustering. Additionally, we used the same method to analyze the association between grandmothers’ family planning knowledge and that of co-resident adolescents. Results The odds of correct adolescent modern family planning knowledge were 1.81 (95% CI = 1.27,2.58) times higher in households with a grandmother. The study also identified higher odds of adolescent knowledge of modern contraceptives in households where grandmothers also had correct knowledge (OR 2.00, 95%, CI = 0.97,4.11), although this association was not statistically significant at the 0.05 alpha level. There was insufficient evidence to support the association between grandmother’s co-residency and correct adolescent knowledge of the healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy. Conclusion This study provides support for expanding adolescent reproductive health to include the role of senior women in promoting and transmitting health care knowledge to younger women in the household."
