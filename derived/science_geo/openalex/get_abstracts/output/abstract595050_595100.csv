https://openalex.org/W2754057936,"Grape berries harbor a wide range of microbes originating from the vineyard environment, many of which are recognized for their role in the must fermentation process shaping wine quality. To better clarify the contribution of the microbiome of grape fruits during wine fermentation, we used high-throughput sequencing to identify bacterial and fungi communities associated with berries and musts of Cannonau. This is the most important cultivar-wine of Sardinia (Italy) where most vineyards are cultivated without phytochemical treatments. Results suggested that microbiomes of berries collected at four different localities share a core composition characterized by Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonadales, Bacillales, and Rhodospirillales. However, any area seems to enrich berries microbiome with peculiar microbial traits. For example, berries belonging to the biodynamic vineyards of Mamoiada were rich in Bacillales typical of manure (i.e. Lysinibacillus, Bacillus, and Sporosarcina), whereas in the Santadi locality, berries showed soil bacteria such as Pasteurellales and Bacteroidales as well as Rhodospirillales and Lactobacillales which are commonly involved in wine fermentation. In the case of fungi, the most abundant taxa were Dothioraceae, Pleosporaceae, and Saccharomycodaceae, and although the proportion of these families varied among localities, they occurred ubiquitously in all vineyards. During vinification processes performed at the same wine cellar under controlled conditions and without using any yeast starter, more than 50% of bacteria groups of berries reached musts, and each locality had its own private bacteria signature, even if Saccharomyces cerevisiae represented the most abundant fungal species. This work suggests that natural berries microbiome could be influenced by pedoclimatic and anthropologic conditions (e.g., farming management), and the fruits' microorganisms persist during the fermentation process. For these reasons, a reliable wine genotyping should include the entire holobiont (plant and all its symbionts), and bioprospecting activities on grape microbiota could lead to improved viticulture yields and wine quality."

Design Cross-sectional, observational study. Participants and measurements A triaxial accelerometer was used in a subsample from the Toledo Study for Healthy Aging (519 participants, 67–97 years) to assess several sedentary behaviour patterns including sedentary time per day, the number and duration (min) of breaks in sedentary time per day, and the proportion of the day spent in sedentary bouts of 10 minutes or more. Frailty was assessed using the Frailty Trait Scale (FTS). Regression analysis was used to ascertain the associations between sedentary behaviour patterns and frailty. Results Sedentary time per day and the proportion of the day spent in sedentary bouts of 10 minutes or more, were positively associated with frailty in the study sample. Conversely, the time spent in breaks in sedentary time was negatively associated with frailty. Conclusion In summary, breaking up sedentary time and time spent in sedentary behaviour are associated with frailty in older people."

https://openalex.org/W2754815237,"Urban spaces have a great impact on how people’s emotion and behaviour. There are number of factors that impact our brain responses to a space. This paper presents a novel urban place recommendation approach, that is based on modelling in-situ EEG data. The research investigations leverages on newly affordable Electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets, which has the capability to sense mental states such as meditation and attention levels. These emerging devices have been utilized in understanding how human brains are affected by the surrounding built environments and natural spaces. In this paper, mobile EEG headsets have been used to detect mental states at different types of urban places. By analysing and modelling brain activity data, we were able to classify three different places according to the mental state signature of the users, and create an association map to guide and recommend people to therapeutic places that lessen brain fatigue and increase mental rejuvenation. Our mental states classifier has achieved accuracy of (%90.8). NeuroPlace breaks new ground not only as a mobile ubiquitous brain monitoring system for urban computing, but also as a system that can advise urban planners on the impact of specific urban planning policies and structures. We present and discuss the challenges in making our initial prototype more practical, robust, and reliable as part of our on-going research. In addition, we present some enabling applications using the proposed architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2754081936,"Galectins are a family of lectins that bind β-galactosides through their conserved carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) and can induce aggregation with glycoproteins or glycolipids on the cell surface and thereby regulate cell activation, migration, adhesion, and signaling. Galectin-3 has an intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain and a canonical CRD. Unlike the other 14 known galectins in mammalian cells, which have dimeric or tandem-repeated CRDs enabling multivalency for various functions, galectin-3 is monomeric, and its functional multivalency therefore is somewhat of a mystery. Here, we used NMR spectroscopy, mutagenesis, small-angle X-ray scattering, and computational modeling to study the self-association–related multivalency of galectin-3 at the residue-specific level. We show that the disordered N-terminal domain (residues ∼20–100) interacts with itself and with a part of the CRD not involved in carbohydrate recognition (β-strands 7–9; residues ∼200–220), forming a fuzzy complex via inter- and intramolecular interactions, mainly through hydrophobicity. These fuzzy interactions are characteristic of intrinsically disordered proteins to achieve liquid–liquid phase separation, and we demonstrated that galectin-3 can also undergo liquid–liquid phase separation. We propose that galectin-3 may achieve multivalency through this multisite self-association mechanism facilitated by fuzzy interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2754908833,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive breast cancer subtype. The high rate of metastasis associated to the fact that these cells frequently display multidrug resistance, make the treatment of metastatic disease difficult. Development of antitumor metal-based drugs was started with the discovery of cisplatin, however, the severe side effects represent a limitation for its clinical use. Ruthenium (Ru) complexes with different ligands have been successfully studied as prospective antitumor drugs. In this work, we demonstrated the activity of a series of biphosphine bipyridine Ru complexes (1) [Ru(SO4)(dppb)(bipy)], (2) [Ru(CO3)(dppb)(bipy)], (3) [Ru(C2O4)(dppb)(bipy)] and (4) [Ru(CH3CO2)(dppb)(bipy)]PF6 [where dppb = 1,4-bis(diphenylphosphino)butane and bipy = 2,2'-bipyridine], on proliferation of TNBC (MDA-MB-231), estrogen-dependent breast tumor cells (MCF-7) and a non-tumor breast cell line (MCF-10A). Complex (4) was most effective among the complexes and was selected to be further investigated on effects on tumor cell adhesion, migration, invasion and in apoptosis. Moreover, DNA and HSA binding properties of this complex were also investigated. Results show that complex (4) was more efficient inhibiting proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells over non-tumor cells. In addition, complex (4) was able to inhibit MDA-MB231 cells adhesion, migration and invasion and to induce apoptosis and inhibit MMP-9 secretion in TNBC cells. Complex (4) should be further investigated in vivo in order to stablish its potential to improve breast cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2754415726,"ATP-sensitive potassium (KATP) channels are widely expressed in the cardiovascular system, where they regulate a range of biological activities by linking cellular metabolism with membrane excitability. KATP channels in vascular smooth muscle have a well-defined role in regulating vascular tone. KATP channels are also thought to be expressed in vascular endothelial cells, but their presence and function in this context are less clear. As a result, we aimed to investigate the molecular composition and physiological role of endothelial KATP channels. We first generated mice with an endothelial specific deletion of the channel subunit Kir6.1 (eKO) using cre-loxP technology. Data from qRT-PCR, patch clamp, ex vivo coronary perfusion Langendorff heart experiments, and endothelial cell Ca2+ imaging comparing eKO and wild-type mice show that Kir6.1-containing KATP channels are indeed present in vascular endothelium. An increase in intracellular [Ca2+], which is central to changes in endothelial function such as mediator release, at least partly contributes to the endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation induced by the KATP channel opener pinacidil. The absence of Kir6.1 did not elevate basal coronary perfusion pressure in eKO mice. However, vasorelaxation was impaired during hypoxia in the coronary circulation, and this resulted in greater cardiac injury during ischemia-reperfusion. The response to adenosine receptor stimulation was impaired in eKO mice in single cells in patch clamp recordings and in the intact coronary circulation. Our data support the existence of an endothelial KATP channel that contains Kir6.1, is involved in vascular reactivity in the coronary circulation, and has a protective role in ischemia reperfusion."
https://openalex.org/W2755315911,"Although depression and anxiety represent significant yet treatable comorbidities in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), their impact on the clinical course and prognosis of IPF remain unclear.We investigated the prevalence and clinical significance of depression and anxiety in patients with IPF.The present study included a prospective cohort comprising 112 Korean patients with IPF who had completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire.Symptoms of depression and anxiety were present in 25.9% and 21.4% of patients with IPF, respectively (HADS scores ≥8). No significant differences in demographic data, age, sex, smoking status, Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (MMRC) scores, pulmonary function tests, or Gender-Age-Physiology Index for IPF were observed between patients with depression or anxiety and those without. However, in patients with anxiety, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) scores were significantly higher than those of patients without anxiety (40.5 versus 23.5; p = 0.003). The survival rate and total number of hospital admissions did not significantly differ between patients with depression/anxiety and those without.Our findings indicate that depression and anxiety are relatively common in patients with IPF. Although no significant differences were noted with regard to survival rate and hospitalization, the present study suggests that depression and anxiety significantly influence quality of life in patients with IPF."
https://openalex.org/W2751669791,"Unlike age-matched men, premenopausal women benefit from cardiovascular protection. Estrogens protect against apoptosis of endothelial cells (ECs), one of the hallmarks of endothelial dysfunction leading to cardiovascular disorders, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. The inflammatory cytokine TNFα causes EC apoptosis while dysregulating the Notch pathway, a major contributor to EC survival. We have previously reported that 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment activates Notch signaling in ECs. Here, we sought to assess whether in TNFα-induced inflammation Notch is involved in E2-mediated protection of the endothelium. We treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with E2, TNFα, or both and found that E2 counteracts TNFα-induced apoptosis. When Notch1 was inhibited, this E2-mediated protection was not observed, whereas ectopic overexpression of Notch1 diminished TNFα-induced apoptosis. Moreover, TNFα reduced the levels of active Notch1 protein, which were partially restored by E2 treatment. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of estrogen receptor β (ERβ), but not ERα, abolished the effect of E2 on apoptosis. Additionally, the E2-mediated regulation of the levels of active Notch1 was abrogated after silencing ERβ. In summary, our results indicate that E2 requires active Notch1 through a mechanism involving ERβ to protect the endothelium in TNFα-induced inflammation. These findings could be relevant for assessing the efficacy and applicability of menopausal hormone treatment, because they may indicate that in women with impaired Notch signaling, hormone therapy might not effectively protect the endothelium.

Despite many efforts to improve primary prevention and treatment, cardiovascular diseases remain the leading cause of death for women worldwide (1Nichols M. Townsend N. Scarborough P. Rayner M. Cardiovascular disease in Europe 2014: epidemiological update.Eur. Heart J. 2014; 35: 2929Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Premenopausal women have lower risk of developing cardiovascular diseases when compared with age-matched men but this difference disappears when considering post-menopausal women (2Yang X.P. Reckelhoff J.F. Estrogen, hormonal replacement therapy and cardiovascular disease.Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2011; 20: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The different cardiovascular risk among pre- and post-menopausal women has been largely ascribed to the protective actions of estrogens against endothelial dysfunction, which represents the first step toward onset and progression of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases (3Jensen H.A. Mehta J.L. Endothelial cell dysfunction as a novel therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.Expert. Rev. Cardiovasc. Ther. 2016; 14: 1021-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Apoptosis of endothelial cells is one of the hallmarks of endothelial dysfunction, which also include reduced nitric oxide (NO) production, increased endothelium permeability, and adhesion of inflammatory cells (4Sitia S.

Among the many pathways that interact with estrogen receptors the Notch pathway has a prominent role in endothelial cells survival. In general, Notch signaling mediates the communication between adjacent cells, influencing their proliferation, migration, survival, and differentiation (18Guruharsha K.G. Kankel M.W. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. The Notch signalling system: recent insights into the complexity of a conserved pathway.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2012; 13: 654-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Mammals have four Notch receptors (Notch 1–4) and five ligands (Delta-like 1, 3, 4 and Jagged-1 and 2), all single-pass transmembrane proteins located at the plasma membrane. Notch receptors are synthesized as single-chain precursors and cleaved by a furin-like protease into an extracellular and a transmembrane subunit in the Golgi apparatus. These two subunits are held together on the cell membrane by non-covalent bonds. The binding of a Notch ligand triggers the removal of the extracellular subunit, a subsequent proteolytic cut by A Disintegrin And Metalloprotease (ADAM10 and/or -17) followed by an intramembranous cleavage by γ-secretase, a multisubunits membrane protease that releases the intracellular active form of Notch (NICD). In canonical Notch signaling, NICD translocates into the nucleus where it modulates transcription of several genes via binding the RBP-Jκ (recombinant signal-binding protein 1 for Jκ) transcription factor (19Espinoza I. Miele L. Notch inhibitors for cancer treatment.Pharmacol. Ther. 2013; 139: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and mediating the displacement of co-repressors and the recruitment of co-activators. The most studied Notch target genes belong to the Hairy and Enhancer of Split (HES) and Hairy and Enhancer of Split with YRPW motif (HEY) gene families, which regulate genes involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis (20Rizzo P.

Furthermore, we evaluated the possible role of ERα and ERβ in the E2-mediated reduction of endothelial cells apoptosis. To determine whether E2 increases endothelial cells survival by counteracting the TNFα-mediated dysregulation of Notch signaling, HUVECs were hormone-deprived for 20 h before treatment with 10 ng/ml of TNFα and 1 nm E2 for 24 h and Notch1, -2, and -4 receptors and ligands Dll4 and Jagged1 protein and mRNA levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), respectively. To detect Notch1, -2, and -4, we used antibodies against the C terminus of these receptors, which recognize the precursor (PC), transmembrane (TM), and active (NICD) forms. An antibody specific for Notch1, cleaved at valine 1744, was used to identify the active form of this receptor (N1ICD). Treatment with 5 μm DAPT (LY-374973), an inhibitor of the γ-secretase, was included to identify the active form of the receptors. We found that TNFα treatment did not affect the precursor (N1PC, 250 kDa) or the transmembrane form of Notch1 (N1TM, 110 kDa), whereas it strongly reduced the levels of the active form (N1ICD, 100 kDa), and this effect was partially counteracted by E2 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). In agreement with our previous findings (12Caliceti C. Aquila G. Pannella M. Morelli M.B. Fortini C. Pinton P. Bonora M. Hrelia S. Pannuti A. Miele L. Rizzo P. Ferrari R. 17β-Estradiol enhances signalling mediated by VEGF-A-delta-like ligand 4-notch1 axis in human endothelial cells.PLoS One. 2013; 8: e71440Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), E2 increased the level of N1ICD also in the absence of TNFα (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Either TNFα alone or co-treatment with E2 did not affect Notch1 mRNA levels (Fig. 1B). Treatment with DAPT completely abolished the activation of Notch1 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). In agreement with studies by others (26Quillard T. Devalliere J. Chatelais M. Coulon F. Séveno C. Romagnoli M. Barillé Nion S. Charreau B.

Biol. 2008; 28: 2258-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), following treatment with TNFα, we observed an increase of the Notch2 protein (N2ICD, 100 kDa) and mRNA and a decrease of Notch4 protein (N4ICD, 64 kDa) and mRNA. E2 had no effect on the modifications induced by TNFα on Notch2 and -4 proteins (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1) and mRNAs (Fig. 1B). Of interest, treatment with DAPT did not interfere with the activation of Notch2 or Notch4 (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). We also confirmed that TNFα positively modulates the Notch ligand Jagged1, both on protein and mRNA levels, whereas it decreases the levels of Dll4 protein (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1) and mRNA (Fig. 1B) (27Sainson R.C. Johnston D.A. Chu H.C. Holderfield M.T. Nakatsu M.N. Crampton S.P. Davis J. Conn E. Hughes C.C. TNF primes endothelial cells for angiogenic sprouting by inducing a tip cell phenotype.Blood. 2008; 111: 4997-5007Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Co-treatment with E2 did not modify the effects of TNFα on Notch ligands protein (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1) or mRNA (Fig. 1B). Our results confirm that TNFα induces Notch2 and Jagged1 and inhibits Notch4 and Dll4 transcription, and show that E2 does not alter the TNFα-mediated transcriptional regulation of these components of the Notch pathway. Furthermore, we show that TNFα negatively affects the levels of N1ICD and that E2, at least partially, counteracts this effect. Additionally, DAPT inhibited Notch1 processing, but had no effect on Notch4 and Notch2, suggesting that, at least at the concentrations used, this γ-secretase inhibitor negatively affects Notch1-, but not Notch2- and Notch4-mediated signaling in HUVECs. To determine whether Notch signaling is required for the protective action of E2 from TNFα-induced apoptosis, we evaluated the effect of E2 treatment on both early (Annexin V-positive) and late (Annexin V/propidium iodide-positive) apoptotic HUVECs following 24 h of exposure to TNFα, in the presence or absence of DAPT. Flow cytometric analysis showed that 24 h of treatment with 10 ng/ml of TNFα increased the number of apoptotic cells, compared with control cells, and that E2 partially counteracted this effect (Fig. 2, A and B). DAPT alone did not affect HUVECs survival but the co-treatment with TNFα increased the number of apoptotic cells, in comparison with treatment with TNFα only (Fig. 2, A and B). Furthermore, in the presence of DAPT, E2 was not able to protect cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig. 2, A and B). These findings suggest that an active Notch pathway is necessary for the E2 protective action against TNFα-induced endothelial cells apoptosis. Because DAPT treatment only inhibited Notch1 activation (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1), we hypothesized that N1ICD might be necessary for the protective effect of E2. To test the involvement of Notch1, HUVECs were transfected with siRNA against Notch1 before treatments with E2 and/or TNFα and apoptosis was detected 24 h later. Notch1 mRNA knockdown was confirmed by Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis (Fig. 3A). Notch1 siRNA did not increase the number of apoptotic cells, compared with control siRNA, but significantly enhanced HUVECs apoptosis in the presence of TNFα (Fig. 3, B and C). Furthermore, in Notch1-silenced HUVECs, E2 was unable to protect cells from TNFα-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3, B and C). To further validate the direct implication of Notch1 in the protective action of E2 against TNFα-induced apoptosis, HUVECs were transfected with a plasmid encoding for N1ICD. Overexpression was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 4A). Upon treatment with TNFα, HUVECs overexpressing N1ICD showed fewer apoptotic cells compared with cells transfected with the empty vector (Fig. 4, B and C). Taken together, these results suggest that active Notch1 is necessary for the anti-apoptotic action of E2 in TNFα-treated HUVECs.Figure 3TNFα-induced apoptosis in Notch1-silenced HUVECs.

Therefore, to identify effectors acting downstream of Notch1 in the E2-mediated protection of endothelial cells, we investigated the activation of Akt (phosphorylation at serine 473) in HUVECs treated with TNFα for 1, 2, and 24 h, with or without E2. Short-term treatments were included because phosphorylation is an early event in the pro-survival activity of Akt (39Madge L.A. Pober J.S.

Western blot analysis showed that 1 and 2 h of treatment with TNFα activated Akt, whereas, 24 h later, Akt phosphorylation was reduced compared with untreated cells. TNFα also had a biphasic effect on N1ICD, which increased during early treatment and decreased, compared with control, after 24 h (Fig. 5, A and B). The addition of DAPT abolished Notch1 activation and strongly decreased Akt phosphorylation induced by TNFα (Fig. 5, C and D). In the presence of E2, at each time point tested, TNFα-treated cells showed a more pronounced phosphorylation of Akt and higher levels of N1ICD compared with cells treated with T"
https://openalex.org/W2754760641,"Recreational fisheries can be prone to severe declines, yet these fisheries, particularly catch-and-release, are often data-limited, constraining our ability to conduct stock assessments. A combination of catch and effort indices derived from fisheries-dependent data (FDD) gathered from fishing logbooks could be a powerful approach to inform these data gaps. This study demonstrates the utility of using different catch metrics such as indices of abundance, species richness associated with reported catch, and the success rate of targeted trips, to assess historical shifts in the trajectory of the data-limited bonefish (Albula vulpes) fishery in Florida Bay, an economically-important recreational fishery within the Caribbean Basin. We used FDD from fishing guide reports submitted to Everglades National Park to determine temporal patterns in the bonefish population over the past 35 years. These reports indicated a decline in recreational catches in Florida Bay since the late 1980s, with an accelerated decline starting in the late 1990s-early 2000s. Analyses showed an overall 42% reduction in bonefish catches. Trends in the proportion of positive trips (i.e., the probability of catching success) followed the declining catch patterns, suggesting major population changes starting in 1999–2000. As bonefish catches declined, species richness in bonefish trips increased by 34%, suggesting a decrease in bonefish abundance and/or shift in fishing effort (e.g., giving-up time, changes in preferred species). Results provide additional resolution to a pattern of decline for bonefish in South Florida and highlight the value of reconstructing time-series for the development of hypotheses about the potential driving mechanisms of species decline. Further, the data-limited nature of most recreational fisheries, and the increase in a use of catch-and-release as a fisheries management strategy point to the need to develop further data integration tools to assess population trends and the sustainability of these fishery resources."

MyoA is part of a membrane-associated protein complex called the glideosome, which is essential for parasite motility and includes the MyoA light chain myosin tail domain–interacting protein (MTIP) and several glideosome-associated proteins (GAPs). However, most studies of MyoA have focused on single stages of the parasite life cycle. We examined MyoA expression throughout the Plasmodium berghei life cycle in both mammalian and insect hosts. In extracellular ookinetes, sporozoites, and merozoites, MyoA was located at the parasite periphery. In the sexual stages, zygote formation and initial ookinete differentiation precede MyoA synthesis and deposition, which occurred only in the developing protuberance. In developing intracellular asexual blood stages, MyoA was synthesized in mature schizonts and was located at the periphery of segmenting merozoites, where it remained throughout maturation, merozoite egress, and host cell invasion. Besides the known GAPs in the malaria parasite, the complex included GAP40, an additional myosin light chain designated essential light chain (ELC), and several other candidate components. This ELC bound the MyoA neck region adjacent to the MTIP-binding site, and both myosin light chains co-located to the glideosome. Co-expression of MyoA with its two light chains revealed that the presence of both light chains enhances MyoA-dependent actin motility.

In conclusion, we have established a system to study the interplay and function of the three glideosome components, enabling the assessment of inhibitors that target this motor complex to block host cell invasion. Three stages of the malaria parasite, sporozoites, ookinetes, and merozoites, are invasive to host cells or tissue, and two stages, sporozoites and ookinetes, are motile. Motility and invasion are active processes, and in Plasmodium as in other apicomplexan parasites, such as Toxoplasma gondii, an actomyosin motor is central to these processes (reviewed in Refs. 1Keeley A.

In Plasmodium, most studies on MyoA have been limited to the asexual blood stage parasites in the mammalian host, although its essential role in gliding motility in P. berghei ookinetes has been demonstrated in promoter swap experiments (25Siden-Kiamos I.

Stage-specific depletion of myosin A supports an essential role in motility of malarial ookinetes.Cell Microbiol. 2011; 13: 1996-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In this study, we have examined the expression and location of MyoA throughout the malaria parasite life cycle, including all invasive stages, and its temporal profile during merozoite and ookinete development. We have examined the composition of the glideosome in asexual blood stages by immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry of proteins associated with GFP-tagged MyoA, confirming the presence of GAP40 and identifying a new myosin light chain. This essential-type light chain binds to the MyoA neck adjacent to, and in addition to, MTIP. Recombinant PfMyoA binds actin and with both light chains bound demonstrates increased sliding velocity of actin compared with MyoA with just MTIP bound. This is a first important step to reconstituting the Plasmodium glideosome in vitro, which will be an invaluable system with which to dissect the function of, and interplay between, different components of the complex. Expression of the myoA gene was detected by quantitative RT-PCR throughout the parasite life cycle, particularly in schizonts and sporozoites but also in non-activated gametocytes (Fig. 1A). To examine the synthesis and location of the protein throughout the parasite life cycle, we produced a C-terminal GFP-tagged MyoA expressed from the endogenous genomic locus using a strategy we described recently for Plasmodium falciparum MyoA and Plasmodium berghei MyoB (26Yusuf N.A.

Integration of sequence coding for GFP into the endogenous MyoA locus and expression of the tagged protein was confirmed by PCR amplification from genomic DNA using primers that only produce a product following specific integration (Fig. 1C), by Western blotting (Fig. 1D), and by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 1, F–H). Tagging MyoA with GFP resulted in no detectable phenotype; there was no effect on the rate of asexual parasite growth, on male gametogenesis (the number of exflagellation centers), the number of oocysts per mosquito gut, or the efficiency of infection via sporozoite inoculation (as judged by the number of days following infected mosquito bite that parasites were observed by microscopy in blood smears). In a subcellular fractionation of schizonts, the protein was largely associated with the peripheral membrane (carbonate-soluble) and membrane (carbonate-insoluble) fractions rather than in the soluble cell lysate (Fig. 1E), consistent with its association with the glideosome and the IMC membrane compartments. Using live parasite microscopy, the protein was detected uniformly at the periphery of segmenting schizonts and extracellular merozoites in asexual blood stages and at a similar location in extracellular ookinetes and salivary gland sporozoites (Fig. 1F), consistent with location at the IMC. Interestingly, in sporozoites, there was also a clear perinuclear localization. In early cytomere stages of liver-stage schizonts, the signal appeared to be cytosolic, rather than membrane-associated. In late cytomere stages, 55 h after invasion by sporozoites, a clear peripheral location associated with the hepatic merozoites was observed (Fig. 1G). The presence of myoA mRNA in ookinete stages, as well as in non-activated gametocytes as a translationally repressed transcript, prompted us to examine the temporal profile of protein expression during the 24 h of ookinete development divided into six stages (27Janse C.J. Rouwenhorst R.J. Van der Klooster P.F. Van der Kaay H.J. Overdulve J.P. Development of Plasmodium berghei ookinetes in the midgut of Anopheles atroparvus mosquitoes and in vitro.Parasitology. 1985; 91: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1H). MyoA-GFP was not visible in either activated or non-activated gametocytes and was barely detectable in the zygote and stage I and II ookinetes. Following the establishment of morphological polarity at about 10 h after fertilization (stage III), the protein was detectable in the growing protuberance rather than the spherical body in the intermediate retort forms, so-called because of their shape (stages III–V). This location was retained in later stages, with the MyoA-GFP associated with the parasite periphery in fully formed motile ookinetes. There was a concentration of fluorescence detected at the apical tip of the mature ookinete. Immunofluorescence using an antibody against the surface marker P28 was used to visualize the ookinete at all stages of development. The use of P. falciparum allows a more detailed analysis of asexual blood stages than can be achieved with P. berghei. MyoA-GFP was largely undetectable by live fluorescence microscopy until ∼38 h after merozoite invasion of an erythrocyte but was present in later stages at the periphery of developing segmented schizonts and free merozoites (but not associated with the food vacuole/residual body), consistent with its proposed location at the IMC (Fig. 2A). No GFP signal was detected in ring or trophozoite stages, indicating that the protein is not synthesized at this time, and any MyoA carried through with the invading merozoite is degraded rapidly following erythrocyte invasion. Interestingly, the protein was also not detected in early schizonts when the first formation of the IMC can already be detected with, for example, GFP-tagged GAP50 (28Yeoman J.A. Hanssen E. Maier A.G. Klonis N. Maco B. Baum J. Turnbull L. Whitchurch C.B. Dixon M.W.A. Tilley L.

Moon R.W. Knuepfer E. Black S. Holder A.A. Green J.L.

Western blot analysis of parasite extracts at the corresponding time points (Fig. 2B (i)) confirmed that GAP50 is present in early schizonts (detectable from 24 h and strongly expressed 30 h postinvasion). Although a small amount of MyoA-GFP can be detected 27–36 h after merozoite invasion, the strongest expression is detected from 38 h postinvasion. A Western blot analysis of the MyoA-GFP immunoprecipitate obtained from these extracts (Fig. 2B (ii)) indicates that known components of the glideosome complex, MTIP, GAP45, and GAP50, are associated with MyoA from 38 h after erythrocyte invasion by a merozoite. Tagging MyoA with GFP had no effect on the rate of asexual blood stage parasite growth. The peripheral location of MyoA-GFP in mature schizonts and free merozoites was confirmed by an indirect immunofluorescence assay (Fig. 3A). Antibodies against GFP co-localized with antibodies against MTIP, GAP45, and GAP50, consistent with the presence of these proteins in a complex. During erythrocyte invasion, the peripheral location of MyoA did not change during the transition from initial attachment of the merozoite to the intracellular ring stage at the completion of invasion (Fig. 3B). However, thereafter, the signal disappeared until resynthesis during schizogony. A number of proteins associated with the glideosome have been identified in both Plasmodium and Toxoplasma species, and the presence of GAP45, GAP50, and MTIP, some of the known components in P. falciparum asexual blood stages, has been confirmed above. To examine what other proteins might be associated, we examined further the protein complex immunoprecipitated with GFP-specific antibodies. To do this, we first used parasites in which GAP45 was tagged internally with GFP (29Ridzuan M.A.M. Moon R.W. Knuepfer E. Black S. Holder A.A. Green J.L. Subcellular location, phosphorylation and assembly into the motor complex of GAP45 during Plasmodium falciparum schizont development.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e33845Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and then those in which MyoA was tagged at its C terminus with GFP. In the first instance, we were interested to see whether or not GAP40, which is a highly phosphorylated protein (23Treeck M. Sanders J.L. Elias J.E. Boothroyd J.C.

To visualize phosphorylated proteins associated with GFP-GAP45, we metabolically labeled P. falciparum schizont phosphoproteins using [32P]phosphate (Fig. 4). As a control, 3D7 schizonts in which GAP45 was unmodified were used (Fig. 4, lane 1 in A and B). The glideosome was precipitated from schizont lysates using antibodies to GFP, and 32P-labeled phosphoproteins were visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 4A). In addition to GFP-GAP45 itself, there were five labeled proteins that were absent from the control samples. The identities of some were confirmed by immunoprecipitation from schizont lysates with GFP antibodies followed by Western blotting with antibodies against known glideosome components MyoA, GAP45, GAP50, and MTIP (Fig. 4A). The most prominent of the phosphoproteins, with an apparent molecular mass of just under 50 kDa, was distinct from these four proteins, so its identity was examined further by mass spectroscopy following fractionation of the protein precipitate by SDS-PAGE and tryptic digestion of specific bands (Fig. 4, B and C). This analysis clearly identified the protein as GAP40 and confirmed the presence of GAP45 and GAP50 in the immunoprecipitate. The high-molecular weight phosphoprotein, marked with an asterisk in Fig. 4A, was not detected in the SYPRO Ruby-stained immunoprecipitate. High-level phosphorylation of a low-abundance protein is one possible explanation for this discrepancy. An immunoprecipitate from parasites expressing GFP-tagged MyoA was also analyzed by tryptic digestion, with LC-MS/MS analysis of resultant peptides to identify associated proteins. Again, 3D7 schizonts in which MyoA was unmodified were used as a negative control. Table 1 shows the proteins identified only in the MyoA-GFP precipitate by the presence of two or more specific peptides. This approach confirmed the presence of MTIP, GAP50, GAP45, and GAP40. It also identified GAPM2 and GAPM3, which are two of the three GAPM proteins previously shown to associate with the glideosome and IMC (20Bullen H.E. Tonkin C.J. O'Donnell R.A. Tham W.H.

Chem. 2009; 284: 25353-25363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The absence of GAPM1 in the precipitate could be explained by the extremely detergent-resistant property of this protein (20Bullen H.E. Tonkin C.J. O'Donnell R.A. Tham W.H. Papenfuss A.T. Gould S. Cowman A.F. Crabb B.S. Gilson P.R. A novel family of apicomplexan glideosome-associated proteins with an inner membrane-anchoring role.J. Biol.

In addition to these known or expected components of the glideosome, 13 additional proteins were identified; whereas it is likely that some of them represent co-purified contaminants, it cannot be excluded that some represent real components of the complex. For example, it is unlikely that signal peptide peptidase, MESA, and the hexose transporter are part of the glideosome because of their known or predicted subcellular location: the endoplasmic reticulum (33Marapana D.S.

Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between serum leptin and adiponectin levels with severity of proteinuria secondary to lupus nephritis (LN). Methods In a cross-sectional study, 103 women with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) were evaluated for kidney involvement. We compared 30 SLE patients with LN, all of them with proteinuria, versus 73 SLE patients without renal involvement (no LN). A comprehensive set of clinical and laboratory variables was assessed, including serum levels of leptin and adiponectin by ELISA. Multivariate analyses were used to adjust for potential confounders associated with proteinuria in LN. Results We found higher adiponectin levels in the LN group compared with the no LN group (20.4 ± 10.3 vs 15.6 ± 7.8 μg/mL; p = 0.02), whereas no differences were observed in leptin levels (33.3 ± 31.4 vs 22.5 ± 25.5 ng/mL; p = 0.07). Severity of proteinuria correlated with an increase in adiponectin levels (r = 0.31; p = 0.001), but no correlation was observed with leptin. Adiponectin levels were not related to anti-dsDNA or anti-nucleosome antibodies. In the logistic regression, adiponectin levels were associated with a high risk of proteinuria in SLE (OR = 1.06; 95% CI 1.01–1.12; p = 0.02). Instead, leptin was not associated with LN. Conclusion These findings indicate that adiponectin levels are useful markers associated with proteinuria in LN. Further longitudinal studies are required to identify if these levels are predictive of renal relapse."

Common to both viruses is the M2 protein, a homotetrameric transmembrane proton channel that acidifies the virion after endocytosis. Although influenza A M2 (AM2) and B M2 (BM2) are functional analogs, they have little sequence homology, except for a conserved HXXW motif, which is responsible for proton selectivity and channel gating. Importantly, BM2 contains a second titratable histidine, His-27, in the tetrameric transmembrane domain that forms a reverse WXXH motif with the gating tryptophan. To understand how His-27 affects the proton conduction property of BM2, we have used solid-state NMR to characterize the pH-dependent structure and dynamics of His-27. In cholesterol-containing lipid membranes mimicking the virus envelope, 15N NMR spectra show that the His-27 tetrad protonates with higher pKa values than His-19, indicating that the solvent-accessible His-27 facilitates proton conduction of the channel by increasing the proton dissociation rates of His-19. AM2 is inhibited by the amantadine class of antiviral drugs, whereas BM2 has no known inhibitors. We measured the N-terminal interhelical separation of the BM2 channel using fluorinated Phe-5. The interhelical 19F-19F distances show a bimodal distribution of a short distance of 7 Å and a long distance of 15–20 Å, indicating that the phenylene rings do not block small-molecule entry into the channel pore. These results give insights into the lack of amantadine inhibition of BM2 and reveal structural diversities in this family of viral proton channels.

https://openalex.org/W2755388528,"The number of synapses is a major determinant of behavior and many neural diseases exhibit deviations in that number. However, how signaling pathways control this number is still poorly understood. Using the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction, we show here a PI3K-dependent pathway for synaptogenesis which is functionally connected with other previously known elements including the Wit receptor, its ligand Gbb, and the MAPkinases cascade. Based on epistasis assays, we determined the functional hierarchy within the pathway. Wit seems to trigger signaling through PI3K, and Ras85D also contributes to the initiation of synaptogenesis. However, contrary to other signaling pathways, PI3K does not require Ras85D binding in the context of synaptogenesis. In addition to the MAPK cascade, Bsk/JNK undergoes regulation by Puc and Ras85D which results in a narrow range of activity of this kinase to determine normalcy of synapse number. The transcriptional readout of the synaptogenesis pathway involves the Fos/Jun complex and the repressor Cic. In addition, we identified an antagonistic pathway that uses the transcription factors Mad and Medea and the microRNA bantam to down-regulate key elements of the pro-synaptogenesis pathway. Like its counterpart, the anti-synaptogenesis signaling uses small GTPases and MAPKs including Ras64B, Ras-like-a, p38a and Licorne. Bantam downregulates the pro-synaptogenesis factors PI3K, Hiw, Ras85D and Bsk, but not AKT. AKT, however, can suppress Mad which, in conjunction with the reported suppression of Mad by Hiw, closes the mutual regulation between both pathways. Thus, the number of synapses seems to result from the balanced output from these two pathways."

These persistent organic pollutants are associated with a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus. We hypothesise that perinatal (background) exposure to industrial pollutants like dioxins also influences body mass development and energy metabolism in later life.In The Netherlands, the perinatal exposure (prenatal exposure and postnatal lactational intake) to dioxins has been studied prospectively since 1987. Fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c and leptin were analysed in 33 children of the original cohort of 60. BMI, glucose:insulin and BMI:leptin ratios were calculated. Prenatal exposure, lactational intake and current serum levels of dioxins (PCDD/F), dl-PCBs and PBDE concentrations were determined using (HR)GC-MS.Prenatal dioxin (PCDD/F) exposure was positively correlated to the glucose:insulin ratio (p = 0.024) and negatively correlated to the fasting insulin concentration (p = 0.017) in adolescence. Postnatal lactational PCDD/F intake was also negatively correlated to fasting insulin concentration (p = 0.028). Current serum levels of PCDD/Fs and total TEQ (dl-PCBs+PCDD/Fs) were positively correlated to the fasting serum glucose concentration (p = 0.015 and p = 0.037, respectively).No metabolic effects were seen in association with current serum levels of PBDEs. A positive correlation between the insulin and leptin concentrations (p = 0.034) was observed. No effects were found on leptin levels, BMI:leptin ratio, HbA1c levels or BMI.This study indicates that prenatal and lactational exposure influences glucose metabolism in adolescents, presumably through a negative effect on insulin secretion by pancreatic beta cells. Additionally, the very low recent background exposure to dioxins in puberty possibly has an effect on the glucose level."

https://openalex.org/W2754348793,"The placebo effect is usually studied in clinical settings for decreasing negative symptoms such as pain, depression and anxiety. There is interest in exploring the placebo effect also outside the clinic, for enhancing positive aspects of performance or cognition. Several studies indicate that placebo can enhance cognitive abilities including memory, implicit learning and general knowledge. Here, we ask whether placebo can enhance creativity, an important aspect of human cognition.Subjects were randomly assigned to a control group who smelled and rated an odorant (n = 45), and a placebo group who were treated identically but were also told that the odorant increases creativity and reduces inhibitions (n = 45). Subjects completed a recently developed automated test for creativity, the creative foraging game (CFG), and a randomly chosen subset (n = 57) also completed two manual standardized creativity tests, the alternate uses test (AUT) and the Torrance test (TTCT). In all three tests, participants were asked to create as many original solutions and were scored for originality, flexibility and fluency.The placebo group showed higher originality than the control group both in the CFG (p<0.04, effect size = 0.5) and in the AUT (p<0.05, effect size = 0.4), but not in the Torrance test. The placebo group also found more shapes outside of the standard categories found by a set of 100 CFG players in a previous study, a feature termed out-of-the-boxness (p<0.01, effect size = 0.6).The findings indicate that placebo can enhance the originality aspect of creativity. This strengthens the view that placebo can be used not only to reduce negative clinical symptoms, but also to enhance positive aspects of cognition. Furthermore, we find that the impact of placebo on creativity can be tested by CFG, which can quantify multiple aspects of creative search without need for manual coding. This approach opens the way to explore the behavioral and neural mechanisms by which placebo might amplify creativity."
https://openalex.org/W2755989260,"Epithelial-mesenchymal interactions drive embryonic fusion events during development, and perturbations of these interactions can result in birth defects. Cleft palate and neural tube defects can result from genetic defects or environmental exposures during development, yet very little is known about the effect of chemical exposures on fusion events during human development because of a lack of relevant and robust human in vitro assays of developmental fusion behavior. Given the etiology and prevalence of cleft palate and the relatively simple architecture and composition of the embryonic palate, we sought to develop a three-dimensional culture system that mimics the embryonic palate and could be used to study fusion behavior in vitro using human cells. We engineered size-controlled human Wharton's Jelly stromal cell (HWJSC) spheroids and established that 7 days of culture in osteogenesis differentiation medium was sufficient to promote an osteogenic phenotype consistent with embryonic palatal mesenchyme. HWJSC spheroids supported the attachment of human epidermal keratinocyte progenitor cells (HPEKp) on the outer spheroid surface likely through deposition of collagens I and IV, fibronectin, and laminin by mesenchymal spheroids. HWJSC spheroids coated in HPEKp cells exhibited fusion behavior in culture, as indicated by the removal of epithelial cells from the seams between spheroids, that was dependent on epidermal growth factor signaling and fibroblast growth factor signaling in agreement with palate fusion literature. The method described here may broadly apply to the generation of three-dimensional epithelial-mesenchymal co-cultures to study developmental fusion events in a format that is amenable to predictive toxicology applications."

We observed two binding modes of ζcyt to the bilayers in dynamic equilibrium: one in which ζcyt is peripherally associated with lipid headgroups and one in which it penetrates deeply into the bilayer. Such an equilibrium between the peripherally bound and embedded forms of ζcyt apparently controls accessibility of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation signal transduction pathway.

Under such circumstances, the utility function can be non-negative for a specific price range and generate an inverted U-shaped function. The extra virgin olive oil market in Chile is a good example. Although domestic production and consumption have increased significantly in the last few years, consumer knowledge of this product is still limited. The objective of this study was to analyze Chilean consumer preferences and willingness to pay for extra virgin olive oil attributes. Consumers were segmented taking into account purchasing frequency. A Random Parameter Logit model was estimated for preference heterogeneity. Results indicate that the utility function is nonlinear allowing us to differentiate between two regimes. In the first regime, olive oil behaves as a conspicuous good, that is, higher utility is assigned to higher prices and consumers prefer foreign products in smaller containers. Under the second regime, Chilean olive oil in larger containers is preferred."

To investigate the effect of NTR extensions on the enzymatic behavior of individual isoforms, we overexpressed and purified the three full-length human isoforms from suspension-adapted HEK cells. MYO1CC favored the actomyosin closed state (AMC), MYO1C16 populated the actomyosin open state (AMO) and AMC equally, and MYO1C35 favored the AMO state. Moreover, the full-length constructs isomerized before ADP release, which has not been observed previously in truncated MYO1CC constructs. Furthermore, global numerical simulation analysis predicted that MYO1C35 populated the actomyosin·ADP closed state (AMDC) 5-fold more than the actomyosin·ADP open state (AMDO) and to a greater degree than MYO1CC and MYO1C16 (4- and 2-fold, respectively). On the basis of a homology model of the 35-amino acid NTR of MYO1C35 (NTR35) docked to the X-ray structure of MYO1CC, we predicted that MYO1C35 NTR residue Arg-21 would engage in a specific interaction with post-relay helix residue Glu-469, which affects the mechanics of the myosin power stroke. In addition, we found that adding the NTR35 peptide to MYO1CC yielded a protein that transiently mimics MYO1C35 kinetic behavior. By contrast, NTR35, which harbors the R21G mutation, was unable to confer MYO1C35-like kinetic behavior. Thus, the NTRs affect the specific nucleotide-binding properties of MYO1C isoforms, adding to their kinetic diversity. We propose that this level of fine-tuning within MYO1C broadens its adaptability within cells. The MYO1C gene produces three alternatively spliced isoforms, differing only in their N-terminal regions (NTRs). These isoforms, which exhibit both specific and overlapping nuclear and cytoplasmic functions, have different expression levels and nuclear–cytoplasmic partitioning. To investigate the effect of NTR extensions on the enzymatic behavior of individual isoforms, we overexpressed and purified the three full-length human isoforms from suspension-adapted HEK cells. MYO1CC favored the actomyosin closed state (AMC), MYO1C16 populated the actomyosin open state (AMO) and AMC equally, and MYO1C35 favored the AMO state. Moreover, the full-length constructs isomerized before ADP release, which has not been observed previously in truncated MYO1CC constructs. Furthermore, global numerical simulation analysis predicted that MYO1C35 populated the actomyosin·ADP closed state (AMDC) 5-fold more than the actomyosin·ADP open state (AMDO) and to a greater degree than MYO1CC and MYO1C16 (4- and 2-fold, respectively).

https://openalex.org/W2754854466,"Proteasome is a proteolytic complex responsible for intracellular protein turnover in eukaryotes, archaea and in some actinobacteria species. Previous work has demonstrated that in Schistosoma mansoni parasites, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 affects parasite development. However, the molecular targets affected by MG-132 in S. mansoni are not entirely known. Here, we used expression microarrays to measure the genome-wide changes in gene expression of S. mansoni adult worms exposed in vitro to MG-132, followed by in silico functional analyses of the affected genes using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Scanning electron microscopy was used to document changes in the parasites’ tegument. We identified 1,919 genes with a statistically significant (q-value ≤ 0.025) differential expression in parasites treated for 24 h with MG-132, when compared with control. Of these, a total of 1,130 genes were up-regulated and 790 genes were down-regulated. A functional gene interaction network comprised of MG-132 and its target genes, known from the literature to be affected by the compound in humans, was identified here as affected by MG-132. While MG-132 activated the expression of the 26S proteasome genes, it also decreased the expression of 19S chaperones assembly, 20S proteasome maturation, ubiquitin-like NEDD8 and its partner cullin-3 ubiquitin ligase genes. Interestingly, genes that encode proteins related to potassium ion binding, integral membrane component, ATPase and potassium channel activities were significantly down-regulated, whereas genes encoding proteins related to actin binding and microtubule motor activity were significantly up-regulated. MG-132 caused important changes in the worm tegument; peeling, outbreaks and swelling in the tegument tubercles could be observed, which is consistent with interference on the ionic homeostasis in S. mansoni. Finally, we showed the down-regulation of Bax pro-apoptotic gene, as well as up-regulation of two apoptosis inhibitor genes, IAP1 and BRE1, and in contrast, down-regulation of Apaf-1 apoptotic activator, thus suggesting that apoptosis is deregulated in S. mansoni exposed to MG-132. A considerable insight has been gained concerning the potential of MG-132 as a gene expression modulator, and overall the data suggest that the proteasome might be an important molecular target for the design of new drugs against schistosomiasis."

In this way, immunoglobulins G (IgG) purified from the serum samples of 92 healthy controls, 10 pre-treated (PR) non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) patients, and 20 NHL patients who underwent chemotherapy (PS) were screened with a phage-displayed random peptide library. Protein-protein interaction networks of the PR and PS groups were analyzed and visualized by Gephi. The results indicated AXIN2, SENP2, TOP2A, FZD6, NLK, HDAC2, HDAC1, and EHMT2, in addition to CAMK2A, PLCG1, PLCG2, GRM5, GRIN2B, GRIN2D, CACNA2D3, and SPTAN1 as hubs in 11 and 7 modules of PR and PS networks, respectively. PR- and PS-specific hubs were evaluated in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome databases. The PR-specific hubs were involved in Wnt SP, signaling by Notch1 in cancer, telomere maintenance, and transcriptional misregulation. In contrast, glutamate receptor SP, Fc receptor-related pathways, growth factors-related SPs, and Wnt SP were statistically significant enriched pathways, based on the pathway analysis of PS hubs. The results revealed that the most PR-specific proteins were associated with events involved in tumor development, while chemotherapy in the PS group was associated with side effects of drugs and/or cancer recurrence. As the findings demonstrated, PR- and PS-specific proteins in this study can be promising therapeutic targets in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W2754476166,"DNA repair proteins must locate rare damaged sites within the genome. DNA polymerase β (Pol β), a member of the DNA polymerase X family that is involved in base excision repair, uses a processive hopping search mechanism to locate substrates. This effectively enhances its search footprint on DNA, increasing the probability of locating damaged sites. Processive searching has been reported or proposed for many DNA-binding proteins, raising the question of how widespread or specific to certain enzymes the ability to perform this function is. To provide insight into this question, we compared the ability of three homologous DNA Pol X family members to perform a processive search for 1-nucleotide gaps in DNA using a previously developed biochemical assay. We found that at near-predicted physiological ionic strengths, the intramolecular searching ability of Pol β is at least 4-fold higher than that of Pol μ and ∼2-fold higher than that of Pol λ. Pol β also was able to perform intersegmental transfer with the intersegmental searching ability of Pol β being at least 6- and ∼2-fold higher than that of Pols μ and λ, respectively. Mutational analysis suggested that differences in the N-terminal domains of these polymerases are responsible for the varying degrees of searching competence. Of note, the differences in processive searching ability observed among the DNA Pol X family members correlated with their proposed biological functions in base excision repair and nonhomologous end joining.

Of note, the differences in processive searching ability observed among the DNA Pol X family members correlated with their proposed biological functions in base excision repair and nonhomologous end joining. To prevent mutations or cell death, DNA repair proteins must locate rare events of DNA damage among the 6 billion base pairs of the human genome. This can be achieved through a protein-protein recruitment mechanism, post-translational modifications, random 3D diffusion, and/or facilitated diffusion (processive searching). Processive searching occurs when a protein binds nonspecifically to DNA and uses it as a conduit to facilitate substrate site location (1Berg O.G. Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Diffusion-driven mechanisms of protein translocation on nucleic acids. 1. Models and theory.Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6929-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar). Processive searching can be further classified by the mechanism the protein uses to diffuse along the DNA. These mechanisms include sliding, hopping, and intersegmental transfer (1Berg O.G. Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Diffusion-driven mechanisms of protein translocation on nucleic acids. 1. Models and theory.Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6929-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 2Halford S.E. Marko J.F. How do site-specific DNA-binding proteins find their targets?.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3040-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). Sliding involves continual contact with a single DNA backbone. In contrast, hopping involves microscopic dissociation and reassociation events that allow the protein to sample both DNA backbones. Both of these intramolecular events are stochastic and effectively serve to increase the DNA-binding footprint of a searching protein on a segment of DNA. Intersegmental transfer is the direct transfer of a protein from one DNA segment to another via a transient microscopic dissociation event or through a bridging intermediate (1Berg O.G.

Intersegmental transfer provides a mechanism for global search of DNA as opposed to more local searching observed with hopping and sliding, and it is proposed to be a more efficient global search mechanism than 3D diffusion because it maximizes time on DNA.

Descriptions of proteins not using a processive searching mechanism are rare. One such reported example is Escherichia coli RNA polymerase where fluorescent single-molecule studies revealed that this enzyme uses a 3D search mechanism for promoter location as opposed to processive searching (15Friedman L.J. Mumm J.P. Gelles J. RNA polymerase approaches its promoter without long-range sliding along DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2013; 110: 9740-9745Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Wang F.

Biol. 2013; 20: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, this study could not rule out short processive searching as the spatial resolution limit of their assays was ∼39 nm (∼115 bp) (16Wang F. Redding S. Finkelstein I.J. Gorman J. Reichman D.R. Greene E.C. The promoter-search mechanism of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase is dominated by three-dimensional diffusion.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2013; 20: 174-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). With the list of proteins that use processive searching growing, questions arise about the specificity of such a process. Indeed, many proteins that bind specific sites in DNA can also bind DNA nonspecifically, a result of overlapping interactions in specific and nonspecific binding modes (17Redding S. Greene E.C. How do proteins locate specific targets in DNA?.Chem. Phys. Lett. 2013; 57010.1016/j.cplett.2013.03.035Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These observations have led to the hypothesis that many DNA-binding enzymes use processive searching to locate their target sites and that this is a general feature of such proteins (17Redding S.

The DNA Pol X family contains four enzymes in humans: Pols β, μ, λ, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) (18Bienstock R.J. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. Phylogenetic analysis and evolutionary origins of DNA polymerase X-family members.DNA Repair. 2014; 22: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). DNA Pol β is critical in the BER pathway and has been demonstrated to perform a processive search (19Howard M.J. Rodriguez Y. Wilson S.H. DNA polymerase β uses its lyase domain in a processive search for DNA damage.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 3822-3832PubMed Google Scholar). DNA Pols μ and λ are involved in nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) with Pol λ having a backup role in BER (20Braithwaite E.K. Kedar P.S. Stumpo D.J. Bertocci B. Freedman J.H. Samson L.D. Wilson S.H.

Pols μ and λ are structurally similar to Pol β except for additional domains on their N termini (Fig. 1); both contain a BRCT domain and Pol λ a serine/proline-rich region, that is proposed to be a site for post-translational modifications (22Frouin I. Toueille M. Ferrari E. Shevelev I. Hübscher U.

The BRCT domains of these enzymes are important for protein-protein interactions during NHEJ (23Mahajan K.N. Nick McElhinny S.A. Mitchell B.S. Ramsden D.A.

Cell. 2005; 19: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), suggesting that their recruitment to damage is dependent on this domain. Pols β, μ, and λ can catalyze nucleotide incorporation into 1-nt-gapped DNA, whereas TdT does not (24Nick McElhinny S.A. Havener J.M. Garcia-Diaz M. Juárez R. Bebenek K. Kee B.L. Blanco L.

Cell. 2005; 19: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Additionally, Pols μ and λ have varying template dependences (24Nick McElhinny S.A. Havener J.M. Garcia-Diaz M. Juárez R. Bebenek K. Kee B.L. Blanco L. Kunkel T.A. Ramsden D.A.

Cell. 2005; 19: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). For instance, Pols μ and λ can both catalyze nucleotide insertion on DNA substrates that contain breaks within the template backbone, whereas Pol β has low or no activity on such a substrate (24Nick McElhinny S.A. Havener J.M. Garcia-Diaz M. Juárez R. Bebenek K. Kee B.L. Blanco L. Kunkel T.A. Ramsden D.A.

Cell. 2005; 19: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). These differences likely reflect the substrates encountered during their respective biological roles. We previously demonstrated that Pol β uses an ionic strength-dependent hopping search mechanism and now extend these studies to show that Pol β can perform intersegmental transfer. Comparative studies with Pols μ and λ demonstrate that Pol β displays the highest processive searching ability among these Pol X family members. The differing levels of searching ability may reflect the biological roles these polymerases play within the cell and suggest that the ability of Pol β to search DNA was selected for during its evolution. Because the processive search assay is based on nucleotide insertion into 1-nt-gapped DNA, the ability of the three polymerases to catalyze this reaction was first examined (Fig. 1C). With saturating concentrations of nucleotide, the single-turnover rate constants (kpol) were similar for Pol β (2.9 s−1) and Pol μ (1.4 s−1), whereas the kpol for Pol λ (0.17 s−1) is ∼10-fold lower. These studies confirm single-nucleotide insertion activity for these enzymes and provide a basis for interpreting the following processive search results. Using our standard processive assay substrate (P20), where two 1-nt gaps on the same DNA strand are separated by 20 bp, the ability of Pols μ and λ to perform a processive search was examined (Fig. 2). Processive search assays were performed under steady-state conditions, and the initial velocities for distributive and processive products were extracted to calculate fraction processive (Fp) values. The Fp value is the probability of an enzyme to perform a productive search, i.e. the ability to locate and catalyze product formation at both substrate sites within a single DNA-binding event (5Hedglin M. O'Brien P.J. Human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase employs a processive search for DNA damage.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11434-11445Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 19Howard M.J. Rodriguez Y. Wilson S.H. DNA polymerase β uses its lyase domain in a processive search for DNA damage.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 3822-3832PubMed Google Scholar). Representative gels for processive assays with Pols β and μ are shown in Fig. 3A. Pol β was at least 4- and ∼2-fold more processive than Pols μ and λ, respectively, at 100 mm ionic strength (Fig. 3C and supplemental Table S1). These data indicate that there is a spectrum of searching ability with the Pol X family members.Figure 3Intramolecular searching abilities of DNA Pols β, μ, and λ.

The error bars represent the S.D. from at least two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the additional N-terminal domains of Pols μ and λ could account for the observed differences in searching ability, as compared with Pol β, truncated forms of these enzymes were used in the processive search assay. These truncations maintain the 8-kDa and polymerase domains only (Fig. 1A). Removal of the BRCT domain of Pol μ (Δ131Pol μ) does not affect its searching ability (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, removal of the N-terminal domains of Pol λ (Δ241Pol λ) significantly but modestly increases Fp (1.6-fold) as compared with full-length Pol λ (Fig. 3C and supplemental Table S1). These data suggest that the additional domains on Pol λ inhibit its processive searching ability, whereas the presence of the BRCT domain in Pol μ has no effect. Facilitated diffusion includes mechanisms of hopping, sliding, and intersegmental transfer (1Berg O.G. Winter R.B. von Hippel P.H. Diffusion-driven mechanisms of protein translocation on nucleic acids. 1. Models and theory.Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6929-6948Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 2Halford S.E. Marko J.F. How do site-specific DNA-binding proteins find their targets?.Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: 3040-3052Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that Pol β can perform an intramolecular hopping mechanism, but its ability to perform intersegmental transfer is unknown. To determine whether Pol β can perform intersegmental transfer, we used a substrate that was previously utilized to characterize the intersegmental transfer ability of the DNA glycosylase AAG (3Hedglin M. Zhang Y. O'Brien P.J. Isolating contributions from intersegmental transfer to DNA searching by alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 24550-24559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This intersegmental transfer substrate contains two DNA duplexes, each containing a 1-nt gap, that are covalently linked through varying PEG linker lengths. This allows for the close positioning of two DNA duplexes with a predicted effective concentration in the low millimolar range (25Tian L. Heyduk T. Bivalent ligands with long nanometer-scale flexible linkers.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 264-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 26Krishnamurthy V.M. Semetey V. Bracher P.J. Shen N. Whitesides G.M. Dependence of effective molarity on linker length for an intramolecular protein-ligand system.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 1312-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Two intersegmental transfer substrates were used: IS4 and IS8, containing four and eight PEG-6 linkers, respectively, where the 6 indicates the number of ethylene glycol units (Fig. 4A). As shown in Fig. 4B, Pol β catalyzed a significant amount of processive product with this substrate, indicating that Pol β can perform intersegmental transfer. Increasing the PEG-6 linker length from four to eight units has no significant effect on Fp (Fig. 5B and supplemental Table S3). This lack of dependence is most likely due to the short persistence length of PEG (∼4 Å) (27Kienberger F. Pastushenko V.P. Gerald K. Gruber H.J. Riener C. Schindler H. Hinterdorfer P. Static and dynamical properties of single poly(ethylene glycol) molecules investigated by force spectroscopy.Single Molecules. 2000; 1: 123-128Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and this is consistent with the behavior of the DNA glycosylase AAG (3Hedglin M. Zhang Y. O'Brien P.J. Isolating contributions from intersegmental transfer to DNA searching by alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.J. Biol. Chem. 2013; 288: 24550-24559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The ionic strength dependence of the fraction processive with the IS4 substrate was indistinguishable from that of the P20 intramolecular substrate (Fig. 5A and supplemental Table S2). We previously showed that mutation of three lysines in the 8-kDa lyase domain of Pol β to alanine (K35A, K68A, and K72A; referred to as KΔ3A) significantly reduced processive searching with the P20 substrate (19Howard M.J. Rodriguez Y. Wilson S.H. DNA polymerase β uses its lyase domain in a processive search for DNA damage.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 3822-3832PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant similarly disrupted the ability of Pol β to perform intersegmental transfer (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data demonstrate that Pol β can perform intersegmental transfer and that this process shares a similar ionic strength dependence with the intramolecular hopping mechanism.Figure 5Pol β intersegmental transfer ionic strength and PEG linker length dependence. A, the ionic strength dependence of intersegmental transfer (IS4) is indistinguishable from the hopping substrate (P20) (supplemental Table S2). The ionic strength data for P20 is taken from Ref. 19Howard M.J. Rodriguez Y. Wilson S.H. DNA polymerase β uses its lyase domain in a processive search for DNA damage.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 3822-3832PubMed Google Scholar. B, variation of the PEG linker length with the intersegmental transfer substrate has no effect on the fraction processive (supplemental Table S3). The KΔ3A mutant reduces intersegmental transfer ability of Pol β. The error bars represent the S.D. from at least two assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next it was determined whether Pols μ and λ can perform intersegmental transfer. As shown in Fig. 6B, full-length Pols μ and λ are at least 6- and ∼3-fold less processive than Pol β, respectively (supplemental Table S4). Overall the Fp values obtained with the intersegmental transfer substrate mirror the Fp values obtained with the P20 hopping substrate, consistent with the proposal that hopping and intersegmental transfer share similar mechanisms (see “Discussion”). Processive searching, as measured here, is dependent on DNA scanning and nucleotide incorporation once a gap is encountered (i.e. product formation) (19Howard M.J. Rodriguez Y. Wilson S.H. DNA polymerase β uses its lyase domain in a processive search for DNA damage.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 3822-3832PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible that a Pol may scan to a second site but dissociate before catalyzing nucleotide insertion, which would lead to a decrease in Fp. The efficiency (E) is the probability of a Pol to catalyze nucleotide insertion versus dissociating from the 1-nt-gapped DNA substrate (6Porecha R.H. Stivers J.T. Uracil DNA glycosylase uses DNA hopping and short-range sliding to trap extrahelical uracils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10791-10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To determine whether DNA scanning or efficiency drive the differences in the Fp values observed among the Pols, we measured the efficiency of nucleotide insertion (Fig. 7). The efficiency values for Pol β and λ are high, 0.78 and 0.93, respectively, indicating that these Pols have a high probability of inserting a nucleotide once a gap is encountered. The efficiency for Pol μ is ∼2-fold lower, 0.39. A fundamental problem facing any DNA repair enzyme is the task of locating its substrate. Facilitated diffusion is one possible solution to this search problem. In this study, we sought to determine whether the searching ability of Pol β is unique to this member of the human Pol X family or whether it is a shared feature among these polymerases. Pol X family members exhibit a spectrum of processive searching abilities for DNA gaps. Pol β demonstrates the highest Fp values in contrast to values ∼2-fold lower and at least 4-fold lower for Pol λ and Pol μ, respectively, as compared with Pol β. Because Pols β, μ, and λ can all perform DNA gap filling, these data may suggest that the searching ability of Pol β has evolved specifically for substrate location. Examples in the literature of DNA repair enzymes not performing processive searching are rare, leading to the view that many, if not all, DNA repair enzymes use processive searching for substrate localization. Here we show that even among homologous enzymes there are varying degrees of processive searching. It is important to discuss the interpretation of low Fp values, such as the ones observed with Pol μ. Using our processive assay, the lowest Fp value observed was 0.05, determined at 150 mm ionic strength with the KΔ3A Pol β mutant (19Howard M.J. Rodriguez Y. Wilson S.H. DNA polymerase β uses its lyase domain in a processive search for DNA damage.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: 3822-3832PubMed Google Scholar). Similar low Fp values have been obtained at high ionic strengths (0.08) and with a site spacing of 80 bp (0.06). It is unlikely that the processive hopping mechanism of Pol β could persist at high ionic strengths; thus these low values likely represent the background of the assay (0.05–0.08). The background arises from the enzyme rebinding to the intermediate substrates to form the processive product in a distributive manner. Similar background behavior has been observed with AAG (5Hedglin M. O'Brien P.J. Human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase employs a processive search for DNA damage.Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 11434-11445Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Additionally, because the kcat values of Pols μ and λ are significantly lower than that of Pol β, the concentrations of Pols μ and λ used in the processive assays described here were ∼3-fold higher than for Pol β (supplemental Table S1). This increases the probability of rebinding to intermediates. For transparency, we have chosen to represent the data as obtained without correction. We propose that the Fp values observed with Pol μ likely represent background activity, and therefore Pol μ is most likely not processive under these conditions. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that Pol μ uses some amount of processive searching inside the cell because our assay conditions are probably not mimicking such an environment. For instance, the addition of crowding agents can increase processive searching (28Cravens S.L. Schonhoft J.D. Rowland M.M. Rodriguez A.A. Anderson B.G. Stivers J.T. Molecular crowding enhances facilitated diffusion of two human DNA glycosylases.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). But if we assume that these effects would scale with the -fold differences we observed between the polymerases, then it is reasonable to propose that Pol β is more processive than Pols μ and λ. The observed Fp value is dependent on the searching ability and the efficiency of nucleotide insertion (6Porecha R.H. Stivers J.T. Uracil DNA glycosylase uses DNA hopping and short-range sliding to trap extrahelical uracils.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 10791-10796Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Measurement of the efficiency values for these Pols reveals that the low Fp values observed with Pol λ, as compared with Pol β, are due to a decrease in searching ability as Pol λ has a high efficiency value (0.93). The decrease in the Fp value observed with Pol μ derives from decreases in both searching ability and efficiency. It may be possible that protein-protein interactions (i.e. Ku70/80) increase the efficiency for Pol μ. In this case, the Fp may increase to 0.3 from 0.12 for the P20 intramolecular substrate at 100 mm ionic strength. Similarly, increasing the efficiency to 1.0 for Pol λ would only increase the Fp to 0.24 from 0.22 for the same substrate and conditions. Thus, even if the efficiency was increased to 1.0 for both Pol μ and λ, the Fp would still be ∼2-fold lower than the Fp value for Pol β. The gradient of searching abilities observed correlates with the proposed biological function"

Here, we dedicated the current work to investigate the role of thyroid hormone analogue (L-thyroxine, L-TH) in regulating the renal cytotoxicity using in vivo and in vitro models. Swiss mice were exposed to gamma radiation (IRR, 6Gy) or treated with cisplatin (CIS, 15 mg/kg, i.p.) for induction of nephrotoxicity. Remarkably, pretreatment with L-TH (1μg/kg) ameliorated the elevated kidney function biomarkers, oxidative stress and protected the renal tissue from the subsequent cellular damage. Likewise, L-TH inhibited the apoptotic cascade by down-regulating the extreme consumption of the cellular energy (ATP), the expression of caspase-3 and Bax, and the stimulation of cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR)/calcium mobilization. Moreover, incubation with L-TH (120nM/4h) significantly blocked the cytotoxicity of CIS on Vero cells and the depletion of NAD+ content as well as modified the ADP-ribose cyclase (CD38) enzymatic activity. High doses of L-TH (up to30 nM/4h) inversely increased the radiosensitivity of Vero cells towards IRR (up to 6Gy). On the other hand, L-TH did not interfere CIS-induced cytotoxicity of colorectal adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) cell line. In conclusion, pretreatment with L-TH could be a promising protective approach to the renal cellular damage induced during either CIS or IRR therapy by regulating the unbalanced oxidative status, the expression of pro-apoptotic biomarkers via modulation of cADPR mediated-calcium mobilization."
https://openalex.org/W2756173613,"In protein kinase research, identifying and addressing small molecule binding sites other than the highly conserved ATP-pocket are of intense interest because this line of investigation extends our understanding of kinase function beyond the catalytic phosphotransfer. Such alternative binding sites may be involved in altering the activation state through subtle conformational changes, control cellular enzyme localization, or in mediating and disrupting protein-protein interactions. Small organic molecules that target these less conserved regions might serve as tools for chemical biology research and to probe alternative strategies in targeting protein kinases in disease settings. Here, we present the structure-based design and synthesis of a focused library of 2-arylquinazoline derivatives to target the lipophilic C-terminal binding pocket in p38α MAPK, for which a clear biological function has yet to be identified. The interactions of the ligands with p38α MAPK was analyzed by SPR measurements and validated by protein X-ray crystallography."

These two proteins combine to form anthrax lethal toxin (LT), whose proximal targets are mitogen-activated kinase kinases (MKKs). However, the downstream mediators of LT toxicity remain elusive. Here we report that LT exposure rapidly reduces the levels of c-Jun, a key regulator of cell proliferation and survival. Blockade of proteasome-dependent protein degradation with the 26S proteasome inhibitor MG132 largely restored c-Jun protein levels, suggesting that LT promotes degradation of c-Jun protein. Using the MKK1/2 inhibitor U0126, we further show that MKK1/2–Erk1/2 pathway inactivation similarly reduces c-Jun protein, which was also restored by MG132 pre-exposure. Interestingly, c-Jun protein rebounded to normal levels 4 h following U0126 exposure but not after LT exposure. The restoration of c-Jun in U0126-exposed cells was associated with increased c-Jun mRNA levels and was blocked by inactivation of the JNK1/2 signaling pathway. These results indicate that LT reduces c-Jun both by promoting c-Jun protein degradation via inactivation of MKK1/2–Erk1/2 signaling and by blocking c-Jun gene transcription via inactivation of MKK4–JNK1/2 signaling. In line with the known functions of c-Jun, LT also inhibited cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of LT-resistant MKK2 and MKK4 variants partially restored Erk1/2 and JNK1/2 signaling in LT-exposed cells, enabling the cells to maintain relatively normal c-Jun protein levels and cell proliferation. Taken together, these findings indicate that LT reduces c-Jun protein levels via two distinct mechanisms, thereby inhibiting critical cell functions, including cellular proliferation.

https://openalex.org/W2756150416,"Measuring the similarity between two sentences is often difficult due to their small lexical overlap. Instead of focusing on the sets of features in two given sentences between which we must measure similarity, we propose a sentence similarity method that considers two types of constraints that must be satisfied by all pairs of sentences in a given corpus. Namely, (a) if two sentences share many features in common, then it is likely that the remaining features in each sentence are also related, and (b) if two sentences contain many related features, then those two sentences are themselves similar. The two constraints are utilized in an iterative bootstrapping procedure that simultaneously updates both word and sentence similarity scores. Experimental results on SemEval 2015 Task 2 dataset show that the proposed iterative approach for measuring sentence semantic similarity is significantly better than the non-iterative counterparts."
https://openalex.org/W2754893432,"Background DM remains a risk factor for poor outcome after stent-implantation, but little is known if and how DM affects the vascular response to BVS. Aim The aim of our study was to examine coronary responses to bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) in swine with and without diabetes mellitus fed a ‘fast-food’ diet (FF-DM and FF-NDM, respectively) by sequential optical coherence tomography (OCT)-imaging and histology. Methods Fifteen male swine were evaluated. Eight received streptozotocin-injection to induce DM. After 9 months (M), 32 single BVS were implanted in epicardial arteries with a stent to artery (S/A)-ratio of 1.1:1 under quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and OCT guidance. Lumen, scaffold, neointimal coverage and composition were assessed by QCA, OCT and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) pre- and/or post-procedure, at 3M and 6M. Additionally, polarization-sensitive (PS)-OCT was performed in 7 swine at 6M. After sacrifice at 3M and 6M, histology and polymer degradation analysis were performed. Results Late lumen loss was high (~60%) within the first 3M after BVS-implantation (P<0.01 FF-DM vs. FF-NDM) and stabilized between 3M and 6M (<5% change in FF-DM, ~10% in FF-NDM; P>0.20). Neointimal coverage was highly heterogeneous in all swine (DM vs. NDM P>0.05), with focal lipid accumulation, irregular collagen distribution and neointimal calcification. Likewise, polymer mass loss was low (~2% at 3M, ~5% at 6M;P>0.20) and not associated with DM or inflammation. Conclusion Scaffold coverage showed signs of neo-atherosclerosis in all FF-DM and FF-NDM swine, scaffold polymer was preserved and the vascular response to BVS was not influenced by diabetes."

Registering reasons for missing values at the time of data collection, or-in the case of sharing existing data-before making data available to other teams, can save time and efforts, improve scientific value and help to prevent erroneous assumptions and biased results. To ensure that encoding of missing data is sufficient to understand the reason why data are missing, it should ideally be context-free. Therefore, 11 context-free codes of missing data were carefully designed based on three completed randomized controlled clinical trials and tested in a new randomized controlled clinical trial by an international team consisting of clinical researchers and epidemiologists with extended experience in designing and conducting trials and an Information System expert. These codes can be divided into missing due to participant and/or participation characteristics (n = 6), missing by design (n = 4), and due to a procedural error (n = 1). Broad implementation of context-free missing data encoding may enhance the possibilities of data sharing and pooling, thus allowing more powerful analyses using existing data."

https://openalex.org/W2755717128,"This study aims to provide convergent understanding of the neural basis of auditory word processing efficiency using a multimodal imaging. We investigated the structural and functional correlates of word processing efficiency in healthy individuals. We acquired two structural imaging (T1-weighted imaging and diffusion tensor imaging) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during auditory word processing (phonological and semantic tasks). Our results showed that better phonological performance was predicted by the greater thalamus activity. In contrary, better semantic performance was associated with the less activation in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), supporting the neural efficiency hypothesis that better task performance requires less brain activation. Furthermore, our network analysis revealed the semantic network including the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and pMTG was correlated with the semantic efficiency. Especially, this network acted as a neural efficient manner during auditory word processing. Structurally, DLPFC and cingulum contributed to the word processing efficiency. Also, the parietal cortex showed a significate association with the word processing efficiency. Our results demonstrated that two features of word processing efficiency, phonology and semantics, can be supported in different brain regions and, importantly, the way serving it in each region was different according to the feature of word processing. Our findings suggest that word processing efficiency can be achieved by in collaboration of multiple brain regions involved in language and general cognitive function structurally and functionally."
https://openalex.org/W2754457263,"Objective To estimate associations of progestin-only contraceptives with persistent pelvic girdle pain 18 months after delivery. Methods Prospective population based cohort study during the years 2003–2011. We included 20,493 women enrolled in the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study who reported pelvic girdle pain in pregnancy week 30. Data were obtained by 3 self-administered questionnaires and the exposure was obtained by linkage to the Prescription Database of Norway. The outcome was pelvic girdle pain 18 months after delivery. Results Pelvic girdle pain 18 months after delivery was reported by 9.7% (957/9830) of women with dispense of a progestin-only contraceptive and by 10.5% (1114/10,663) of women without dispense (adjusted odds ratio 0.93; 95% CI 0.84–1.02). In sub-analyses, long duration of exposure to a progestin intrauterine device or progestin-only oral contraceptives was associated with reduced odds of persistent pelvic girdle pain (Ptrend = 0.021 and Ptrend = 0.005). Conversely, long duration of exposure to progestin injections and/or a progestin implant was associated with modest increased odds of persistent pelvic girdle pain (Ptrend = 0.046). Early timing of progestin-only contraceptive dispense following delivery (≤3 months) was not significantly associated with persistent pelvic girdle pain. Conclusions Our findings suggest a small beneficial effect of progestin intrauterine devices and progestin-only oral contraceptives on recovery from pelvic girdle pain. We cannot completely rule out an opposing adverse effect of exposure to progestin injections and/or progestin implants. However, the modest increased odds of persistent pelvic girdle pain among these users could be a result of unmeasured confounding."
