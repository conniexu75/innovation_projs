https://openalex.org/W3020301997,"A real-time trial of a cancer blood test Cancers diagnosed early are often more responsive to treatment. Blood tests that detect molecular markers of cancer have successfully identified individuals already known to have the disease. Lennon et al. conducted an exploratory study that more closely reflects the way in which such blood tests would be used in the future. They evaluated the feasibility and safety of incorporating a multicancer blood test into the routine clinical care of 10,000 women with no history of cancer. Over a 12-month period, the blood test detected 26 cancers of different types. A combination of the blood test and positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging led to surgical removal of nine of these cancers. Use of the blood test did not result in a large number of futile follow-up procedures. Science , this issue p. eabb9601"
https://openalex.org/W3017430478,"Introduction With the global spread of COVID-19, there is a compelling public health interest in quantifying who is at increased risk of contracting disease. Occupational characteristics, such as interfacing with the public and being in close quarters with other workers, not only put workers at high risk for disease, but also make them a nexus of disease transmission to the community. This can further be exacerbated through presenteeism, the term used to describe the act of coming to work despite being symptomatic for disease. Quantifying the number of workers who are frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, and understanding which occupational groups they represent, can help to prompt public health risk response and management for COVID-19 in the workplace, and subsequent infectious disease outbreaks. Methods To estimate the number of United States workers frequently exposed to infection and disease in the workplace, national employment data (by Standard Occupational Classification) maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) was merged with a BLS O*NET survey measure reporting how frequently workers in each occupation are exposed to infection or disease at work. This allowed us to estimate the number of United States workers, across all occupations, exposed to disease or infection at work more than once a month. Results Based on our analyses, approximately 10% (14.4 M) of United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per week. Approximately 18.4% (26.7 M) of all United States workers are employed in occupations where exposure to disease or infection occurs at least once per month. While the majority of exposed workers are employed in healthcare sectors, other occupational sectors also have high proportions of exposed workers. These include protective service occupations (e.g. police officers, correctional officers, firefighters), office and administrative support occupations (e.g. couriers and messengers, patient service representatives), education occupations (e.g. preschool and daycare teachers), community and social services occupations (community health workers, social workers, counselors), and even construction and extraction occupations (e.g. plumbers, septic tank installers, elevator repair). Conclusions The large number of persons employed in occupations with frequent exposure to infection and disease underscore the importance of all workplaces developing risk response plans for COVID-19. Given the proportion of the United States workforce exposed to disease or infection at work, this analysis also serves as an important reminder that the workplace is a key locus for public health interventions, which could protect both workers and the communities they serve."

https://openalex.org/W3018995158,"TMC1 and TMC2 (TMC1/2) have been proposed to form the pore of the mechanotransduction channel of cochlear hair cells. Here, we show that TMC1/2 cannot form mechanotransduction channels in cochlear hair cells without TMIE. TMIE binds to TMC1/2, and a TMIE mutation that perturbs TMC1/2 binding abolishes mechanotransduction. N-terminal TMIE deletions affect the response of the mechanotransduction channel to mechanical force. Similar to mechanically gated TREK channels, the C-terminal cytoplasmic TMIE domain contains charged amino acids that mediate binding to phospholipids, including PIP2. TMIE point mutations in the C terminus that are linked to deafness disrupt phospholipid binding, sensitize the channel to PIP2 depletion from hair cells, and alter the channel’s unitary conductance and ion selectivity. We conclude that TMIE is a subunit of the cochlear mechanotransduction channel and that channel function is regulated by a phospholipid-sensing domain in TMIE with similarity to those in other mechanically gated ion channels."
https://openalex.org/W3018157587,"Background Despite access to free antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), noncompliance to treatment continues to be a significant challenge in Eswatini. Yet studies investigating barriers to ART adherence in Eswatini are scarce. Most notably, there is a lack of research regarding rural women in Eswatini, who are currently the country’s most vulnerable to HIV infection. Therefore, the objective of the study is to investigate individual, household, and community level barriers to ART adherence among rural women living with HIV. Methods We conducted a qualitative study to investigate individual, household, and community level barriers to ART adherence. We conducted focus group discussions with HIV-infected women (n = 4) from rural villages in Eswatini, and in-depth interviews with healthcare workers (n = 8) serving the area clinics. Open and axial coding techniques were used for data analysis and interpreted within a social ecological framework. Results Our findings revealed several individual level barriers including hunger, side effects of ART, personal stress, lack of disclosure of HIV status, alcohol use, and forgetting to take ART. Lack of food, unemployment and scarcity of financial resources were identified as critical barriers at the household level. Community and institutional barriers encompassed factors related to health delivery such as lack of privacy, travel time, transportation costs, excessive alcohol use by healthcare workers, maltreatment, public and self-stigma, gossip, and long waits at clinics. Conclusions Rural women living with HIV face multilevel barriers to ART adherence. Support programs aimed at increasing ART adherence among this vulnerable population need to develop targeted polices to alleviate challenges rural women face, beginning with expanding qualifications for food assistance programs."
https://openalex.org/W3018828082,"Most business-as-usual scenarios for farming under changing climate regimes project that the agriculture sector will be significantly impacted from increased temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns. Perhaps ironically, agricultural production contributes substantially to the problem with yearly greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of about 11% of total anthropogenic GHG emissions, not including land use change. It is partly because of this tension that Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) has attracted interest given its promise to increase agricultural productivity under a changing climate while reducing emissions. Considerable resources have been mobilized to promote CSA globally even though the potential effects of its widespread adoption have not yet been studied. Here we show that a subset of agronomic practices that are often included under the rubric of CSA can contribute to increasing agricultural production under unfavorable climate regimes while contributing to the reduction of GHG. However, for CSA to make a significant impact important investments and coordination are required and its principles must be implemented widely across the entire sector."
https://openalex.org/W3019738589,"The individual’s socioeconomic conditions are the most relevant to predict the quality of someone’s health. However, such information is not usually found in medical records, making studies in the area difficult. Therefore, it is common to use composite indices that characterize a region socioeconomically, such as the Human Development Index (HDI). The main advantage of the HDI is its understanding and adoption on a global scale. However, its applicability is limited for health studies since its longevity dimension presents mathematical redundancy in regression models. Here we introduce the GeoSES, a composite index that summarizes the main dimensions of the Brazilian socioeconomic context for research purposes. We created the index from the 2010 Brazilian Census, whose variables selection was guided by theoretical references for health studies. The proposed index incorporates seven socioeconomic dimensions: education, mobility, poverty, wealth, income, segregation, and deprivation of resources and services. We developed the GeoSES using Principal Component Analysis and evaluated its construct, content, and applicability. GeoSES is defined at three scales: national (GeoSES-BR), Federative Unit (GeoSES-FU), and intra-municipal (GeoSES-IM). GeoSES-BR dimensions showed a good association with HDI-M (correlation above 0.85). The model with the poverty dimension best explained the relative risk of avoidable cause mortality in Brazil. In the intra-municipal scale, the model with GeoSES-IM was the one that best explained the relative risk of mortality from circulatory system diseases. By applying spatial regressions, we demonstrated that GeoSES shows significant explanatory potential in the studied scales, being a compelling complement for future researches in public health."
https://openalex.org/W3019973306,"About one third of foodborne illness outbreaks in Europe are acquired in the home and eating undercooked poultry is among consumption practices associated with illness. The aim of this study was to investigate whether actual and recommended practices for monitoring chicken doneness are safe. Seventy-five European households from five European countries were interviewed and videoed while cooking chicken in their private kitchens, including young single men, families with infants/in pregnancy and elderly over seventy years. A cross-national web-survey collected cooking practices for chicken from 3969 households. In a laboratory kitchen, chicken breast fillets were injected with cocktails of Salmonella and Campylobacter and cooked to core temperatures between 55 and 70°C. Microbial survival in the core and surface of the meat were determined. In a parallel experiment, core colour, colour of juice and texture were recorded. Finally, a range of cooking thermometers from the consumer market were evaluated. The field study identified nine practical approaches for deciding if the chicken was properly cooked. Among these, checking the colour of the meat was commonly used and perceived as a way of mitigating risks among the consumers. Meanwhile, chicken was perceived as hedonically vulnerable to long cooking time. The quantitative survey revealed that households prevalently check cooking status from the inside colour (49.6%) and/or inside texture (39.2%) of the meat. Young men rely more often on the outside colour of the meat (34.7%) and less often on the juices (16.5%) than the elderly (>65 years old; 25.8% and 24.6%, respectively). The lab study showed that colour change of chicken meat happened below 60°C, corresponding to less than 3 log reduction of Salmonella and Campylobacter. At a core temperature of 70°C, pathogens survived on the fillet surface not in contact with the frying pan. No correlation between meat texture and microbial inactivation was found. A minority of respondents used a food thermometer, and a challenge with cooking thermometers for home use was long response time. In conclusion, the recommendations from the authorities on monitoring doneness of chicken and current consumer practices do not ensure reduction of pathogens to safe levels. For the domestic cook, determining doneness is both a question of avoiding potential harm and achieving a pleasurable meal. It is discussed how lack of an easy “rule-of-thumb” or tools to check safe cooking at consumer level, as well as national differences in contamination levels, food culture and economy make it difficult to develop international recommendations that are both safe and easily implemented."
https://openalex.org/W3020327827,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant brain tumor that evades therapy regimens. Since cellular dormancy is one strategy for surviving, and since chemokines determine the environmental conditions in which dormancy occurs, we investigated how chemokines affect temozolomide (TMZ)-promoted cellular dormancy entry and exit in GBM cells. TMZ administration over ten days promoted cellular dormancy entry, whereas discontinuing TMZ for a further 15 days resulted in resumption of proliferation. Co-administration of a chemokine cocktail containing CXCL12, CXCL16, and CX3CL1 resulted in both delayed entry and exit from cellular dormancy. A microarray-based transcriptome analysis in LN229 GBM cells revealed that cellular dormancy entry was characterized by an increased expression of CCL2 and SAA2, while THSD4, FSTL3, and VEGFC were upregulated during dormancy exit. Co-stimulation with the chemokine cocktail reduced upregulation of identified genes. After verifying the appearance of identified genes in human GBM primary cultures and ex vivo samples, we clarified whether each chemokine alone impacts cellular dormancy mechanisms using specific antagonists and selective CRISPR/Cas9 clones. While expression of CCL2 and SAA2 in LN229 cells was altered by the CXCL12-CXCR4-CXCR7 axis, CXCL16 and CX3CL1 contributed to reduced upregulation of THSD4 and, to a weaker extent, of VEGFC. The influence on FSTL3 expression depended on the entire chemokine cocktail. Effects of chemokines on dormancy entry and exit-associated genes were detectable in human GBM primary cells, too, even if in a more complex, cell-specific manner. Thus, chemokines play a significant role in the regulation of TMZ-promoted cellular dormancy in GBMs."

Finding the best transcriptome assembly has not been the subject of walnuts research as yet. This research generated 240,179,782 reads from 11 walnut leaves according to cDNA libraries. The reads provided a complete de novo transcriptome assembly. Fifteen different transcriptome assemblies were constructed from five different well-known assemblers used in scientific literature with different k-mer lengths (Bridger, BinPacker, SOAPdenovo-Trans, Trinity and SPAdes) as well as two merging approaches (EvidentialGene and Transfuse). Based on the four quality metrics of assembly, the results indicated an efficiency in the process of merging the assemblies after being generated by de novo assemblers. Finally, EvidentialGene was recognized as the best assembler for the de novo assembly of the leaf transcriptome in walnut. Among a total number of 183,191 transcripts which were generated by EvidentialGene, there were 109,413 transcripts capable of protein potential (59.72%) and 104,926 were recognized as ORFs (57.27%). In addition, 79,185 transcripts were predicted to exist with at least one hit to the Pfam database. A number of 3,931 transcription factors were identified by BLAST searching against PlnTFDB. Furthermore, 6,591 of the predicted peptide sequences contained signaling peptides, while 92,704 contained transmembrane domains. Comparison of the assembled transcripts with transcripts of the walnut and published genome assembly for the ‘Chandler’ cultivar using the BLAST algorithm led to identify a total number of 27,304 and 19,178 homologue transcripts, respectively. De novo transcriptomes in walnut leaves can be developed for the future studies in functional genomics and genetic studies of walnuts."
https://openalex.org/W3020719200,"This paper explores reproductive decision-making among young women in South Africa’s informal settlements and considers whether and how agency and social norm theory inform their decisions. Understanding whether, when and how young women make decisions about conception and motherhood is critical for supporting women to avoid unplanned, early motherhood. Qualitative data were collected from 15 young women in informal settlements in eThekwini, South Africa at three time points over 18 months, using in-depth interviews, participant observation and photovoice, and were analysed inductively. When the young women were teenagers and into their early twenties, and had not yet had a child, most paid little attention to whether or not they conceived. This shifted as they grew older and/or after having a first child, at which point many of the women began to express, and sometimes act upon, a greater desire to control whether and when they conceived and delay further pregnancies. At different times in their lives, both social norms and reproductive agency, specifically ‘distributed agency’ played significant roles in influencing their reproductive decision-making. Social norms held the most influence when they were teenagers and experiencing normative pressures to have a baby while young. As they grew older and/or had a first child they began to assert some agentic control around their reproduction. We therefore recommend that in order to improve the effectiveness of services and interventions supporting young women to delay unplanned pregnancies, programmers, researchers and policy makers must develop a better understanding of the role of social norms and agency at different stages of women’s lives."
https://openalex.org/W3023308729,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) can come in different forms, presenting problems for diagnostic classification. Here, we examined personality traits in a large sample of patients (N = 265) diagnosed with SAD in comparison to healthy controls (N = 164) by use of the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R) and Karolinska Scales of Personality (KSP). In addition, we identified subtypes of SAD based on cluster analysis of the NEO-PI-R Big Five personality dimensions. Significant group differences in personality traits between patients and controls were noted on all Big Five dimensions except agreeableness. Group differences were further noted on most lower-order facets of NEO-PI-R, and nearly all KSP variables. A logistic regression analysis showed, however, that only neuroticism and extraversion remained significant independent predictors of patient/control group when controlling for the effects of the other Big Five dimensions. Also, only neuroticism and extraversion yielded large effect sizes when SAD patients were compared to Swedish normative data for the NEO-PI-R. A two-step cluster analysis resulted in three separate clusters labelled Prototypical (33%), Introvert-Conscientious (29%), and Instable-Open (38%) SAD. Individuals in the Prototypical cluster deviated most on the Big Five dimensions and they were at the most severe end in profile analyses of social anxiety, self-rated fear during public speaking, trait anxiety, and anxiety-related KSP variables. While additional studies are needed to determine if personality subtypes in SAD differ in etiological and treatment-related factors, the present results demonstrate considerable personality heterogeneity in socially anxious individuals, further underscoring that SAD is a multidimensional disorder."
https://openalex.org/W3019706266,"Background Multimorbidity, the presence of 2 or more non-communicable diseases (NCDs), is a major contributor to inequalities of health in Australia and Japan. We use nationally representative data to examine (i) the relationships between multimorbidity with healthcare utilisation and productivity loss and (ii) whether these relationships differed by socioeconomic groups. Methods Cross-sectional analyses using the Household, Income, and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) and the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR) surveys. We examined 6,382 (HILDA) and 3,503 (JSTAR) adults aged ≥50 years. We applied multivariable regression, logistic and negative binomial models. Results Prevalence of multimorbidity was overall 38.6% (46.0%, 36.1%, 28.9% amongst those in the lowest, middle and highest education group, respectively) in Australia, and 28.4% (33.9%, 24.6%, 16.6% amongst those in the lowest, middle and highest education group, respectively) in Japan. In Australia and Japan, more NCDs was associated with greater healthcare utilisation. In Australia and Japan, more NCDs was associated with higher mean number of sick leave days amongst the employed and lower odds of being employed despite being in the labour force. The association between multimorbidity and lower retirement age was found in Australia only. Conclusion Having more NCDs pose significant economic burden to the health system and wider society in Australia and Japan. Targeted policies are critical to improve financial protection, especially for lower income groups who are more likely to have multiple NCDs. These individuals incur both high direct and indirect costs, which lead to a greater risk of impoverishment."
https://openalex.org/W3019999252,"The gut microbiota is often affected by the dietary and lifestyle habits of the host, resulting in a better efficacy that favors energy harvesting from the consumed food. Our objective was to characterize the composition of gut microbiota in adult Saudis and investigate possible association with lifestyle and dietary practices. Feces from 104 Saudi volunteers (48% males) were tested for microbiota by sequencing the V3-V4 region of bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). For all participants, data were collected related to their lifestyle habits and dietary practices. The relative abundance (RA) of Fusobacteria was significantly higher in normal weight Saudis (P = 0.005, false discovery rate–FDR = 0.014). Individuals who consumed more coffee presented marginally significant more RA of Fusobacteria (P = 0.02, FDR = 0.20) in their gut microbiota compared to those reporting low or no coffee intake, but the RA of Fusobacteria was significantly higher in smokers compared to non-smokers (P = 0.009, FDR = 0.027). The RA of Fusobacteria was also significantly higher in those reporting daily consumption of bread (P = 0.005, FDR = 0.015). At the species level, the gut microbiota of people who consumed coffee was dominated by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron followed by Phascolarctobacterium faecium and Eubacterium rectale. Similarly, the gut microbiota of smokers was also enriched by B. thetaiotaomicron and Lactobacillus amylovorus. Smoking cessation, bread and coffee consumption induce changes in the intestinal microbial composition of Saudis. This indicates the significance of diet and lifestyle practices in the determination of the composition of the gut microbiota, which could possibly lead later to changes in metabolic profile and weight."
https://openalex.org/W3019729065,"F-box proteins, such as F-box/WD repeat-containing protein 7 (FBW7), are essential components of the SKP1-CUL1-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligases. They bind to S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1) through the F-box motif and deliver their protein substrate to the E3 ligase complex for ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 16 (FBXL16) is a poorly studied F-box protein. Because it does not interact with the scaffold protein cullin 1 (CUL1), we hypothesized that FBXL16 might not form a functional SCF-E3 ligase complex. In the present study, we found that FBXL16 up-regulates the levels of proteins targeted by SCF-E3 ligases, such as C-MYC, β-catenin, and steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3). Focusing on C-MYC, a well-known oncoprotein overexpressed in most human cancers, we show that FBXL16 stabilizes C-MYC by antagonizing FBW7-mediated C-MYC ubiquitination and degradation. Further, we found that, although FBXL16 does not interact with CUL1, it interacts with SKP1 via its N-terminal F-box domain and with its substrate C-MYC via its C-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) domain. We found that both the F-box domain and the LRR domain are important for FBXL16-mediated C-MYC stabilization. In line with its role in up-regulating the levels of the C-MYC and SRC-3 oncoproteins, FBXL16 promoted cancer cell growth and migration and colony formation in soft agar. Our findings reveal that FBXL16 is an F-box protein that antagonizes the activity of another F-box protein, FBW7, and thereby increases C-MYC stability, resulting in increased cancer cell growth and invasiveness.

Protein degradation is a crucial biological process mainly mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The ubiquitin-proteasome system is a selective process in which the proteins are covalently conjugated with multiple ubiquitin proteins prior to degradation by the 26S proteasome complex (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (9759494): 425-47910.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.425Crossref PubMed Scopus (6578) Google Scholar, 2Pickart C.M.

Protein ubiquitination is achieved by an enzymatic cascade catalyzed by a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3). E3 ligases are responsible for the selectivity of the substrate (1Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev.

More than 500 E3 ligases are categorized into four major classes: HECT-type, RING finger–type, U-box–type, and PHD finger–type (3Dye B.T. Schulman B.A. Structural mechanisms underlying posttranslational modification by ubiquitin-like proteins.Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Among the RING finger–type, the subfamily of the cullin-based E3 is the largest one and includes the SKP1-CUL1-F-box protein (SCF) complex. The SCF ubiquitin ligase complex is composed of the adaptor protein SKP1, the scaffold protein Cullin1 (CUL1) and a specific F-box protein (5Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J.

CUL1, as a scaffold protein, interacts with SKP1 and the RING finger protein RBX1 to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase platform. The F-box protein binds to SKP1 through its F-box motif and brings the bound substrate to the E3 ligase complex, followed by RBX1-mediated ubiquitination and the subsequent degradation of the substrate (5Petroski M.D. Deshaies R.J.

Thus far, 69 F-box proteins have been identified in humans and fall into three subfamilies, depending on their substrate recognition domains: FBXLs (leucine-rich repeats or LRR), FBXWs (WD40 repeats), and FBXOs (other domains) (6Jin J.

FBXL16 is a poorly studied F-box protein which harbors a N-terminal proline-rich domain, an F-box motif, and a C-terminal LRR domain. Interestingly, homozygous knockout of FBXL16 gene in mice leads to perinatal lethality (International Mouse Phenotype Consortium, Ref. 16Dickinson M.E. Flenniken A.M. Ji X. Teboul L.

FBXL16 was shown to be a transcriptional target of E2F1 (18Sato K. Kusama Y. Tategu M. Yoshida K.

Unlike other F-box proteins, including FBW7 and SKP2 (FBXL1), FBXL16 does not show detectable interaction with CUL1 and may not form a functional SCF-E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (17Honarpour N.

Surprisingly, it was shown to interact with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) complex and might regulate the latter's activity (17Honarpour N. Rose C.M. Brumbaugh J. Anderson J. Graham R.L.J.

Despite these interesting preliminary findings about FBX16, little is known about the biochemical roles of FBXL16 as an F-box protein. In this study, we have found that FBXL16 up-regulates the protein levels of several substrates of SCF E3-ligases, in particular c-myc. Mechanistically, FBXL16 increases c-myc protein stability by antagonizing FBW7-mediated polyubiquitination and the subsequent degradation of c-myc. Both the F-box domain and the LRR domain are important for FBXL16 in stabilizing c-myc. In line with its role in up-regulating the level of c-myc and other oncoproteins, we found that FBXL16 promotes cancer cell growth and migration. Taken together, our findings reveal FBXL16 as a unique F-box protein antagonizing the activity of FBW7 and as a new positive regulator of c-myc. Although FBXL16 is structurally an F-box protein and interacts with SKP1, two previous studies suggest that it does not show detectable interaction with CUL1 and thus might not form a functional SCF ubiquitin ligase complex (17Honarpour N.

It is virtually unknown whether or not FBXL16 has a role in regulating the levels of the substrates of SCF-E3 ligases. We postulated that FBXL16 may play a role different from those of other F-box proteins such as FBW7 given that it has interaction with SKP1 but is incapable of forming a stable SCF ubiquitin ligase complex. To test this, we first knocked down FBXL16 separately by using two different siRNAs and then investigated its effect on the levels of several known substrates of SCF E3 ligases, including c-myc, steroid receptor coactivator 3 (SRC-3) (20Wu R.C. Feng Q. Lonard D.M. O'Malley B.W. SRC-3 coactivator functional lifetime is regulated by a phospho-dependent ubiquitin time clock.Cell. 2007; 129 (17574025): 1125-114010.1016/j.cell.2007.04.039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and β-catenin (21Latres E.

Interestingly, knockdown of FBXL16 led to a remarkable reduction of c-myc protein level in A549 lung cancer cells (Fig. 1A). Similarly, the levels of SRC-3 and β-catenin were significantly decreased upon FBXL16 depletion (Fig. 1A), albeit to a lesser level than that of c-myc. To confirm that these results were not because of potential off-target effects of the siRNAs, we overexpressed FLAG-tagged FBXL16 in H1299 lung cancer cells, in which endogenous FBXL16 protein is barely detectable. As the activity of most F-box proteins depends on their F-box domains, we also tested a mutant of FBXL16 lacking its F-box domain (FBXL16ΔFbox). In line with the effects of FBXL16 knockdown in A549 cells, overexpression of FBXL16 increased the levels of c-myc, β-catenin, and SRC-3 protein whereas overexpression of FBXL16ΔFbox did not (Fig. 1B). Taken together, these results clearly suggest that opposite to the down-regulating roles of FBW7 on c-myc and SRC-3 and that of β-TRCP on β-catenin, FBXL16 up-regulates the levels of these substrates of SCF E3 ligases. We observed that FBXL16 had a greater effect on c-myc protein level as compared with SRC-3 and β-catenin. We therefore focused on c-myc to elucidate how FBXL16 up-regulates its protein level. First, we investigated the effect of FBXL16 on c-myc protein stability. Indeed, FBXL16 knockdown decreased c-myc protein stability (a 1.7-fold decrease in half-life) (Fig. 2A). As the effect of FBXL16 on the total c-myc protein level (Fig. 1) appears to be higher than on c-myc protein stability, we wondered whether FBXL16 also affects c-myc mRNA expression level. Indeed, we found that FBXL16 knockdown also reduced c-myc mRNA expression (Fig. S1). To confirm the role of FBXL16 on c-myc protein stability, we generated MDA-MB-231 cells with stable expression of either a GFP control or FBXL16. Consistently, FBXL16 overexpression induced a 1.8-fold increase of c-myc protein half-life (Fig. 2B). As such, these results demonstrate that FBXL16 up-regulates and stabilizes c-myc protein. SCFFBW7 and SCFSKP2 are major E3-ligases responsible for c-myc polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (9Welcker M. Orian A. Jin J. Grim J.A. Harper J.W. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E.

As FBXL16 has opposite effect on c-myc, we postulated that FBXL16 may counteract the down-regulation of c-myc stability by other F-box proteins. To test this, first we knocked down FBXL16, FBW7, or both in A549 cells to see their effects on c-myc protein level. Although FBXL16 knockdown significantly decreased c-myc (Fig. 3A, lane 2), FBW7 depletion significantly increased c-myc protein level (Fig. 3A, lane 3). However, when both proteins were knocked down, no significant effect on c-myc protein was observed (Fig. 3A, lane 4). To confirm this, we co-overexpressed c-myc, along with either FBXL16, FBW7, or both proteins in 293T cells. c-myc protein level was up-regulated when co-overexpressed with FBXL16, but was down-regulated when co-overexpressed with FBW7 (Fig. 3B). Similar to the effect under the condition of the depletion of both FBXL16 and FBW7, co-overexpression of FBXL16 and FBW7 had no significant effect on c-myc level (Fig. 3B, bar 4 versus bar 1). On the contrary, we found that knockdown of FBXL16 had similar effect on c-myc in the presence or absence of SKP2, suggesting that FBXL16 regulates c-myc independently of SKP2 (Fig. S2). Altogether, these results indicate that FBXL16 antagonizes FBW7's function to increase c-myc protein level. We then wanted to determine whether FBXL16 antagonizes FBW7's activity on c-myc ubiquitination. For this purpose, first we co-overexpressed c-myc and HA-ubiquitin along with either an empty vector control, FBXL16, FBW7, or both F-box proteins. As expected, FBW7 overexpression led to a remarkable increase of c-myc polyubiquitination (Fig. 4A, lane 3 versus lane 1). In contrast, FBXL16 overexpression greatly reduced c-myc polyubiquitination (Fig. 4A, lane 4 versus lane 3 and lane 2 versus lane 1). To test whether the role of FBXL16 in inhibiting FBW7-induced c-myc ubiquitination was direct, we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay. Importantly, we found that recombinant FBXL16 protein decreased FBW7-induced polyubiquitination of c-myc in vitro (Fig. 4B). Thus, we conclude that FBXL16 antagonizes the effect of FBW7, leading to a decrease in ubiquitination and increase in stability of c-myc protein. For FBXL proteins, the F-box domain is responsible for interacting with SKP1, the adaptor protein which brings CUL1 and RBX1 to form the SCF-E3 ligase complex; LRR domains are more variable and usually involved in the substrate binding. FBXL16 also harbors an F-box domain and a 7-LRR domain (Fig. 5A). To determine the importance of the F-box and LRR domains for FBXL16's activity, we generated FBXL16ΔFbox that lacks the F-box motif and FBXL16ΔLRR that lacks the C terminus containing the 7 LRRs (Fig. 5A). We first analyzed the interaction of the different forms of FBXL16 with c-myc and SKP1 (Fig. 5B) by performing co-immunoprecipitation/Western blot assays. We found that FBXL16 interacts with both c-myc and SKP1 (compare IP lane 2 with lane 1). The deletion of the F-box domain abolished the interaction of FBXL16 with SKP1 (IP lane 3 versus lane 2), and the deletion of the LRR domain greatly reduced the interaction with c-myc (IP lane 4 versus lane 2). In addition, compared with the full-length FBXL16, FBXL16ΔLRR has reduced interaction with SKP1, indicating that LRR domain, besides its importance in binding with the substrate c-myc, may also contribute to the interaction with SKP1. We then determined the effects of these two deletion mutants on c-myc stability compared with the full-length FBXL16. The results indicated that although c-myc has increased stability when co-overexpressed with FBXL16 (compared with the empty vector control), its stability showed no clear change when co-overexpressed with FBXL16ΔFbox. Intriguingly, c-myc stability was even decreased when co-overexpressed with FBXL16ΔLRR (Fig. 5C), suggesting that this mutant might have a dominant-negative role. These results indicate that both the F-box and LRR domains are important for FBXL16 to regulate c-myc protein stability. FBW7 binds to the phospho-degron pT58-X-X-X-pS62 on c-myc and induces its ubiquitination (9Welcker M. Orian A. Jin J. Grim J.A. Harper J.W. Eisenman R.N. Clurman B.E.

To determine the importance of these residues on FBXL16 activity toward c-myc, we generated T58A, S62A, and T58/S62AA mutants in which the threonine 58 or/and serine 62 were replaced by alanine(s). We first analyzed the interaction between FBXL16 and each different mutant of c-myc compared with WT c-myc by immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis (Fig. 6A). Surprisingly, we found that the mutation of either Thr-58, Ser-62, or both showed little effect on the binding of FBXL16 to c-myc. These results indicate that, unlike the interaction between FBW7 and c-myc (24Yada M. Hatakeyama S. Kamura T. Nishiyama M. Tsunematsu R. Imaki H. Ishida N. Okumura F. Nakayama K. Nakayama K.I. Phosphorylation-dependent degradation of c-Myc is mediated by the F-box protein Fbw7.EMBO J. 2004; 23 (15103331): 2116-212510.1038/sj.emboj.7600217Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar), the binding of FBXL16 to c-myc does not require the phosphorylation on any of these residues. Nevertheless, to determine whether FBXL16 may affect the FBW7/c-myc interaction, we co-overexpressed FBW7 along with FBXL16 or an empty plasmid in 293T cells (Fig. 6B). We found that the binding of FBW7 to c-myc was not changed by FBXL16 overexpression. Taken together, these results indicate that FBXL16 does not compete with FBW7 for binding to c-myc. As FBXL16 up-regulates the levels of oncoproteins c-myc and SRC-3 (Fig. 1), we wanted to determine the roles of FBXL16 in cancer cell growth and migration. First, by dsDNA quantification assay, we found that transient knockdown of FBXL16 in A549 induced a remarkable decrease in cell proliferation (Fig. 7, A and B). To confirm these results, we performed a trypan blue exclusion assay to determine the number of viable cells after transient knockdown of FBXL16. Again, we found that FBXL16 knockdown greatly inhibited A549 cell growth (Fig. S3). The importance of FBXL16 on cancer cell growth was confirmed by the finding that stable expression of FBXL16 significantly promoted MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation (Fig. 7C). We then investigated the role of FBXL16 in cancer cell migration. Knockdown of FBXL16 drastically reduced (about 70%) A549 cell migration (Fig. 7D), whereas FBXL16 overexpression greatly increased MDA-MB-231 cell migration (Fig. 7E). Finally, we examined the role of FBXL16 on anchorage-independent cell growth in soft agar, an indicator of transformation and tumorigenic potential of cells. We decided to use H460 lung cancer cell line as it showed a good and consistent colony formation ability. We were actually incapable of generating cell line or pool with stable depletion of FBXL16, likely because of its essential role on cell growth and/or survival. We then generated H460 stable cell line with tetracycline-inducible knockdown of FBXL16 (Fig. 7F). We found that FBXL16 knockdown greatly decreased the capacity of H460 to form colonies in soft agar (Fig. 7F). Taken together, these results demonstrate that FBXL16 promotes both growth and migration of cancer cells. As c-myc is an essential regulator of cell growth (27Eilers M. Eisenman R.N. Myc's broad reach.Genes Dev. 2008; 22 (18923074): 2755-276610.1101/gad.1712408Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar), we thought that the role of FBXL16 in promoting cancer cell growth would be at least partially through the regulation of c-myc. To test this, we determined if exogenous overexpression of c-myc can rescue cell growth inhibition induced by FBXL16 knockdown. We found that c-myc overexpression was able to partially restore A549 cell growth after FBXL16 knockdown (siFBXL16 + lenti–c-myc versus siFBXL16 + lenti-ctrl, Fig. 7G). These results indicate that FBXL16 promotes cell growth partly through the up-regulation of c-myc. It is virtually unknown what the biochemical activities/functions of FBXL16 are. Given that FBXL16 harbors a conserved F-box domain and a LRR domain but does not form a stable SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, it may have distinct activities/roles as compared with other F-box proteins (e.g. FBW7) which can form functional SCF E3 ligase complex. Indeed, our study shows that opposite to the roles of FBW7 and β-TRCP, FBXL16 up-regulates the levels of several proteins targeted by SCF-E3 ligases, including c-myc and SRC-3, both of which are substrates of FBW7 (9Welcker M.

We, therefore, hypothesized that the expression level and structural alteration of GAGs affect inflammation. We have previously reported that the effects on GAG biosynthesis caused by loss of the tumor suppressor gene exostosin-like 2 (Extl2) influence liver injury and regeneration processes. To examine how altered GAG biosynthesis may underscore the relationship between inflammation and tumorigenesis, we assessed its role in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocarcinoma (HCC) induced by dietary obesity and insulin-resistance. We demonstrated that GAGs produced in the absence of EXTL2 act as DAMPs and directly input signals into cells via the Toll-like 4 receptor. In addition, the subsequent transcriptional activation of inflammatory and tumor-promoting cytokines by NF-κB contributes to injury- and inflammation-driven tumor promotion. Thus, dysregulated biosynthesis of GAGs is considered to increase the risk of HCC in a background of obesity and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3019787593,"Ensuring affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 is part of the internationally agreed Sustainable Development Goals (SDG7). With roughly 3 billion people still lacking access to clean cooking solutions in 2017, this remains an ambitious task. The use of solid biomass such as wood and cow dung for cooking causes household air pollution resulting in severe health hazards. In this context, the Indian government has set up a large program promoting the use of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) in rural areas. While this has led millions of households to adopt LPG, a major fraction of them continues to rely heavily on solid biomass for their daily cooking. In this paper, we evaluate the effect of simple health messaging on the propensity of these households to use LPG more regularly. Our results from rural Rajasthan are encouraging. They show that health messaging increases the reported willingness to pay for LPG, and substantially increases actual consumption. We measure this based on a voucher, which can only be used if LPG consumption is doubled until a certain deadline. Households exposed to health messaging use the voucher about 30% more often than households exposed to a placebo treatment. We further show that the impact of our very brief, but concrete health messaging is close to the effect of a 10% price reduction for a new LPG cylinder. Finally, our study raises some interesting questions about gender-related effects that would be worth consideration in future research."
https://openalex.org/W3020007900,"Introduction Patients with Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) develop plexiform neurofibromas (PNF) and cutaneous neurofibromas. These tumors are a major cause of the patient’s morbidity and mortality. An influence of estrogen and progesterone on tumor growth has been suggested but reports on growth or malignant transformation of tumors during pregnancy remain anecdotal. The purpose of this study was to quantify growth of cutaneous and plexiform neurofibromas in NF1 patients during pregnancy, and to assess the onset of NF1 related symptoms. Material and methods Retrospectively, 13 mothers with NF1 were included and compared to nullipara, nulligravida, age-matched women with NF1. All women received whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before and after pregnancy or after a matched time period. Presence of plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas was evaluated. PNF were subjected to semi-automated volumetry (MedX). The sum of the longest diameters (SLD) of representative cutaneous neurofibromas was determined for both groups. Clinical symptoms and subjective tumor growth were assessed. Results PNF were identified in 12/26 women (46.2%). Follow up showed neither new PNF nor a significant difference in growth rate (median tumor-growth/year: pregnant group—0.38% (IQR -1.1–5.4%) vs control group 3.59% (IQR -2.1–5.5%; P = 0.69). Malignant transformation of PNF was not observed. There was a significant growth of cutaneous neurofibromas in both groups (median SLD increase: pregnant group 17mm; P = 0.0026 / control group 12mm; P = 0.0004) The difference in increase of SLD was not significant (P = 0.48). Singular cutaneous neurofibromas in the pregnant group displayed high levels of tumor growth (>20%/year). NF1-associated symptoms and subjective tumor growth were not significantly increased in pregnant patients. Conclusions Growth of plexiform and cutaneous neurofibromas in pregnant patients is not significantly different compared to non-pregnant patients. Cutaneous neurofibromas show a significant increase in growth over time in both, pregnant and non-pregnant patients and NF1 related clinical symptoms do not significantly aggravate during the course of pregnancy."

Calcium influx through TRPV1 has been shown to activate a calcium-sensitive phospholipase C (PLC) enzyme and to lead to a robust decrease in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2] levels, which is a major contributor to channel desensitization. Diacylglycerol (DAG), the product of the PLC-catalyzed PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis, activates protein kinase C (PKC). PKC is known to potentiate TRPV1 activity during activation of G protein–coupled receptors, but it is not known whether DAG modulates TRPV1 during desensitization. We found here that inhibition of diacylglycerol kinase (DAGK) enzymes reduces desensitization of native TRPV1 in dorsal root ganglion neurons as well as of recombinant TRPV1 expressed in HEK293 cells. The effect of DAGK inhibition was eliminated by mutating two PKC-targeted phosphorylation sites, Ser-502 and Ser-800, indicating involvement of PKC. TRPV1 activation induced only a small and transient increase in DAG levels, unlike the robust and more sustained increase induced by muscarinic receptor activation. DAGK inhibition substantially increased the DAG signal evoked by TRPV1 activation but not that evoked by M1 muscarinic receptor activation. Our results show that Ca2+ influx through TRPV1 activates PLC and DAGK enzymes and that the latter limits formation of DAG and negatively regulates TRPV1 channel activity.

Our findings uncover a role of DAGK in ion channel regulation. The TRPV1 ion channel is a major noxious heat sensor; it is expressed in primary sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia. TRPV1 is an outwardly rectifying nonselective cation channel with high permeability to Ca2+; its activation depolarizes the neuron and induces a robust Ca2+ signal (1Caterina M.J. Schumacher M.A. Tominaga M. Rosen T.A. Levine J.D. Julius D.

In accordance with its role as a noxious heat sensor, activation of TRPV1 by capsaicin, the pungent compound in chili peppers, evokes a burning pain sensation. Proinflammatory mediators such as bradykinin, prostaglandins, and extracellular ATP sensitize TRPV1 to activation by heat, capsaicin, and extracellular protons, which manifest as a left shift of the dose–response curves of these activators (2Cesare P. McNaughton P. A novel heat-activated current in nociceptive neurons and its sensitization by bradykinin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Most of these proinflammatory mediators exert their effects through activation of G protein–coupled receptors that act via Gαq and stimulate PLCβ enzymes. Sensitization of TRPV1 activity has been shown to be mediated mainly by phosphorylation of the channel by PKC at residues Ser-502 and Ser-800 (4Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. Direct phosphorylation of capsaicin receptor VR1 by protein kinase Cϵ and identification of two target serine residues.J. Biol.

The in vivo relevance of phosphorylation of the Ser-800 residue (Ser-801 in mice) has also been demonstrated recently (5Joseph J. Qu L. Wang S. Kim M. Bennett D. Ro J. Caterina M.J. Chung M.K. Phosphorylation of TRPV1 S801 contributes to modality-specific hyperalgesia in mice.J.

Upon sustained maximal stimulation by capsaicin, TRPV1 activity decreases despite the presence of the agonist, a phenomenon termed desensitization (6Koplas P.A. Rosenberg R.L. Oxford G.S. The role of calcium in the desensitization of capsaicin responses in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17 (9133377): 3525-353710.1523/JNEUROSCI.17-10-03525.1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The decrease in TRPV1 activity during desensitization has been shown to be due to a right shift in the capsaicin dose response (7Yao J. Qin F.

We and others have shown earlier that activation of TRPV1 leads to activation of a Ca2+-sensitive PLC, most likely a PLCδ isoform (8Lukacs V. Yudin Y. Hammond G.R. Sharma E. Fukami K. Rohacs T. Distinctive changes in plasma membrane phosphoinositides underlie differential regulation of TRPV1 in nociceptive neurons.J.

Because PI(4,5)P2 is required for TRPV1 activity, depletion of this lipid is a major factor in desensitization (11Rohacs T. Phosphoinositide regulation of TRPV1 revisited.Pflugers Arch. 2015; 467 (25754030): 1851-186910.1007/s00424-015-1695-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The products of PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis by PLC are inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and DAG. DAG activates PKC; although the role of this enzyme is very well established in sensitization (4Numazaki M.

Here we find that inhibition of DAGK enzymes that phosphorylate DAG leads to diminished desensitization of capsaicin-induced currents of native TRPV1 in DRG neurons and recombinant TRPV1 expressed in HEK293 cells. The effect of DAGK inhibition was eliminated when the two key PKC phosphorylation residues, Ser-502 and Ser-800 (4Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. Direct phosphorylation of capsaicin receptor VR1 by protein kinase Cϵ and identification of two target serine residues.J. Biol.

We also found that activation of TRPV1 induced only a small and transient increase in DAG levels, in contrast to the robust and sustained increase evoked by activation of the Gq-coupled M1 muscarinic receptors. Inhibition of DAGK activity substantially increased DAG accumulation induced by TRPV1 activation but not by muscarinic receptor activation. These data indicate that DAG production upon TRPV1 activation is limited by DAGK activation. Our findings uncover a novel role for DAGK enzymes in regulation of TRPV1 activity. To examine the role of DAGK enzymes in TRPV1 channel desensitization, we measured inward currents evoked by capsaicin in mouse DRG neurons at −60 mV holding potential, using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. Consistent with earlier results, capsaicin-induced currents decayed substantially after an initial peak during 75-s application of 1 μm capsaicin. When capsaicin was reapplied 3 min later, it evoked smaller currents (Fig. 1A) whose amplitudes, on average, were less than 20% of the first peak current (Fig. 1D). The decrease in the amplitude of the second application of capsaicin is sometimes referred to as tachyphylaxis to differentiate it from the current decay during the first capsaicin application, which is termed acute desensitization (6Koplas P.A. Rosenberg R.L. Oxford G.S. The role of calcium in the desensitization of capsaicin responses in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons.J. Neurosci. 1997; 17 (9133377): 3525-353710.1523/JNEUROSCI.17-10-03525.1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When the neurons were treated with DAGK inhibitor 1 (DK1), also called R59022 (14Sato M. Liu K. Sasaki S. Kunii N. Sakai H. Mizuno H. Saga H. Sakane F. Evaluations of the selectivities of the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitors R59022 and R59949 among diacylglycerol kinase isozymes using a new non-radioactive assay method.Pharmacology. 2013; 92 (23949095): 99-10710.1159/000351849Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the peak amplitude during the first and second capsaicin application became significantly larger (Fig. 1, B and C). When the current amplitudes were normalized to the first peak in both groups, the relative currents evoked by the second capsaicin application were significantly larger in the DK1-treated group (Fig. 1D), indicating reduced tachyphylaxis. DK1, on average, did not alter the kinetics and extent of acute desensitization (data not shown). Next we tested the involvement of PKC phosphorylation of TRPV1. We transfected HEK293 cells with WT TRPV1 or the S502A/S800A mutant of TRPV1 that lacks the critical phosphorylation sites for PKC-induced sensitization (4Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Toyooka H. Tominaga M. Direct phosphorylation of capsaicin receptor VR1 by protein kinase Cϵ and identification of two target serine residues.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (11884385): 13375-1337810.1074/jbc.C200104200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Fig. 2, A, B, E, and F, show that, in TRPV1-expressing cells treated with DK1, the peak amplitude of the capsaicin-induced current was higher than in cells not treated with DK1 in the first capsaicin application. The peak current induced by the second capsaicin application showed a more robust increase in DK1-treated cells, and thus the ratio of the second to first peak amplitude increased significantly in cells treated with DK1 (Fig. 2F), indicating reduced desensitization (tachyphylaxis). DK1, on the other hand, did not have any effect on the amplitudes of the currents induced by the first or the second capsaicin application in the S502A/S800A mutant of TRPV1 (Fig. 2, C–E). Fig. 2, G and H, shows that, when the current amplitudes were normalized to the peak of the first capsaicin application in each group, DK1, on average, slowed the current decay (acute desensitization) in cells transfected with the WT TRPV1 but not in cells expressing the S502A/S800A mutant. Overall, these data show that DK1 reduces capsaicin-induced desensitization of TRPV1 in a PKC phosphorylation–dependent manner. The effect of the DAGK inhibitor DK1 suggests that DAG accumulation is limited by DAGK activity in response to capsaicin. To test this, next we measured cellular DAG signals using fluorescent sensors in response to TRPV1 stimulation. First, we transfected HEK293 cells with a green fluorescent DAG sensor that responds with an increase in fluorescence intensity to DAG formation, a red fluorescent Ca2+ sensor (Red-GECO) (15Tewson P.H. Quinn A.M. Hughes T.E. A multiplexed fluorescent assay for independent second-messenger systems: decoding GPCR activation in living cells.J. Biomol. Screen. 2013; 18 (23580666): 797-80610.1177/1087057113485427Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), as well as TRPV1 and muscarinic M1 receptors to measure cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels simultaneously with DAG levels. Fig. 3A shows that activation of the Gq-coupled M1 receptors by carbachol induced a large increase in DAG and cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels in these cells. When capsaicin was applied after carbachol, it evoked an increase in Ca2+ but a decrease in fluorescence of the DAG sensor. When capsaicin was applied first, it induced a clear increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ and a decrease in fluorescence of the DAG sensor, preceded by a small transient increase (Fig. 3B). Carbachol applied after capsaicin did not induce any Ca2+ signal or DAG signal (Fig. 3B). We also found that capsaicin induced a large decrease in PI(4,5)P2 levels, indicating PLC activation (Fig. 3, E–G), which is consistent with previous publications (9Borbiro I. Badheka D. Rohacs T. Activation of TRPV1 channels inhibit mechanosensitive Piezo channel activity by depleting membrane phosphoinositides.Sci. Signal. 2015; 8 (25670203): ra1510.1126/scisignal.2005667Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 10Lukacs V. Thyagarajan B. Varnai P. Balla A. Balla T. Rohacs T.

This decrease in PI(4,5)P2 levels eliminates the substrate for PLC and thus explains why carbachol did not induce any DAG or Ca2+ signal after capsaicin. Next we tested whether DAGK inhibition can rescue the DAG signal in response to TRPV1 activation. Fig. 4, A and B, shows that, in cells treated with DK1, the DAG signal in response to capsaicin was larger than without the inhibitor. The effect of capsaicin on the peak of the DAG signal in the presence of DK1 was not statistically significantly different from that induced by M1 activation by carbachol. DK1 also potentiated the Ca2+ responses to capsaicin (Fig. 4, A and C), which is consistent with its effect on TRPV1 desensitization (Figure 1, Figure 2). Pretreatment with DAG kinase inhibitor 2 (DK2; R59949) (14Sato M. Liu K. Sasaki S. Kunii N. Sakai H. Mizuno H. Saga H. Sakane F. Evaluations of the selectivities of the diacylglycerol kinase inhibitors R59022 and R59949 among diacylglycerol kinase isozymes using a new non-radioactive assay method.Pharmacology. 2013; 92 (23949095): 99-10710.1159/000351849Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) or the DAG lipase (DAGL) inhibitor RHC80267 (16Thams P.

Our data show that, without DAG Kinase inhibition, capsaicin induced a negligible DAG signal (Figs. 3B and 4A), despite clear PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis (Fig. 3, E–G). Next we tested whether this apparent lack of DAG accumulation was due to the low affinity of the DAG sensor we used. To this end, we transfected HEK293 cells with the high-affinity DAG sensor containing the tandem C1 domains (C1ab) of protein kinase D1 fused to the C terminus of GFP (GFP-PKD C1ab) as well as TRPV1 and M1 muscarinic receptors (17Kim Y.J. Guzman-Hernandez M.L. Balla T. A highly dynamic ER-derived phosphatidylinositol-synthesizing organelle supplies phosphoinositides to cellular membranes.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21 (22075145): 813-82410.1016/j.devcel.2011.09.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The GFP-PKD C1ab sensor translocates from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in response to an increase in DAG concentration, which we monitored using confocal microscopy. We found that, in response to capsaicin, this sensor displayed clear translocation to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5, A and C), but the effect was smaller and more transient than the translocation induced by carbachol (Fig. 5, B and D). TRPV1 activation by capsaicin also prevented carbachol from inducing a DAG signal (Fig. 5A). In cells pretreated with DK1, capsaicin induced a more sustained DAG signal than in the absence of the inhibitor (Fig. 5, A and C), but DK1 had no effect on the translocation induced by carbachol (Fig. 5, B and D). The DAG signal induced by capsaicin in the presence of DK1 was comparable with that induced by carbachol (Fig. 5, C and D). Our data indicate that DAGK, but not DAGL activity, decreases DAG accumulation in response to TRPV1 activation. To confirm this conclusion, we used additional pharmacological tools: the DAGK inhibitor ritanserin (18Boroda S. Niccum M. Raje V. Purow B.W. Harris T.E. Dual activities of ritanserin and R59022 as DGKα inhibitors and serotonin receptor antagonists.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2017; 123 (27974147): 29-3910.1016/j.bcp.2016.10.011Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and the DAGL inhibitor DO34 (19Ogasawara D. Deng H. Viader A. Baggelaar M.P.

Conti B. et al.Rapid and profound rewiring of brain lipid signaling networks by acute diacylglycerol lipase inhibition.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2016; 113 (26668358): 26-3310.1073/pnas.1522364112Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Fig. 6, A–C, shows that the transient DAG signal induced by TRPV1 activation became sustained in cells treated with ritanserin but not in cells treated with DO34. Our data with the two different DAG sensors show that TRPV1 activation induces a DAG signal even though it is transient and smaller than that induced by muscarinic receptor activation. Next, we tested whether this small transient increase in DAG has any effect on desensitization. We measured capsaicin-induced inward currents in DRG neurons in the presence and absence of two different PKC inhibitors (Fig. 7, A–F). We found that neither bisindolylmaleimide IV (BIM-IV) nor Gö6976 had a significant effect on the peak current amplitudes evoked by two consecutive 1-min applications of 1 μm capsaicin (Fig. 7, A–D). BIM-IV pretreatment accelerated the current decay during the initial phase of the first capsaicin application (acute desensitization) (Fig. 7, A, C, E, and F). Gö6976, on the other hand, induced only a marginal effect on acute desensitization (Fig. 7, A, B, E, and F), which did not reach statistical significance. This is consistent with Gö6976 not inhibiting PKCϵ (20Liu X. Wang Y. Zhang H. Shen L. Xu Y. Different protein kinase C isoenzymes mediate inhibition of cardiac rapidly activating delayed rectifier K+ current by different G-protein coupled receptors.Br. J. Pharmacol. 2017; 174 (28941256): 4464-447710.1111/bph.14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), the isoform that plays a major role in TRPV1 phosphorylation (12Cesare P. Dekker L.V. Sardini A. Parker P.J. McNaughton P.A. Specific involvement of PKC-ϵ in sensitization of the neuronal response to painful heat.Neuron. 1999; 23 (10433272): 617-62410.1016/S0896-6273(00)80813-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Neither BIM-IV nor Gö6976 had an effect on the peak amplitude (Fig. 7D) or the decay kinetics (data not shown) of the second capsaicin application. The small effect of PKC limited to the initial phase of acute desensitization is consistent with the transient DAG signal in response to capsaicin (Fig. 5). In agreement with the patch clamp experiments, in DRG neurons loaded with the low-affinity Ca2+ indicator FuraFF, the Ca2+ response to 1 μm capsaicin became more transient in the presence of BIM-IV but not Gö6976 (Fig. 7, G and H). Overall, our data show that DAGK activation reduces DAG accumulation in response to TRPV1 activation, which limits the role of PKC to modulating the initial phase of acute desensitization. Fig. 8 shows our overall model of the involvement of DAGK and PKC in TRPV1 regulation during desensitization. The sensitivity of TRPV1 to capsaicin and other stimuli is not static. Upon activation of Gq-coupled receptors, the channel becomes more sensitive to capsaicin, which manifests as a left shift in the capsaicin concentration response relationship but no change in the maximal response (3Tominaga M. Wada M. Masu M. Potentiation of capsaicin receptor activity by metabotropic ATP receptors as a possible mechanism for ATP-evoked pain and hyperalgesia.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This increased sensitivity is largely mediated by direct phosphorylation of the channel by PKC at residues Ser-502 and Ser-800 (4Numazaki M. Tominaga T. Toyooka H. Tominaga M.

When the channel is activated by high concentrations of capsaicin, channel activity desensitizes (6Koplas P.A. Rosenberg R.L. Oxford G.S.

Here we found that, despite robust PLC activation, TRPV1 stimulation leads to only a small and transient increase in DAG levels as opposed to the robust DAG signal induced by activation of Gq-coupled M1 muscarinic receptors. The DAG signal induced by TRPV1 activation was potentiated by DAGK inhibition, indicating that DAGK activity limited DAG accumulation. DAGK inhibition, on the other hand, had no effect on the DAG signal induced by activation of Gq-coupled M1 receptors. Consistent with positive regulation of TRPV1 by PKC, DAGK inhibition also reduced capsaicin-induced desensitization of TRPV1 in a PKC-dependent manner. We used two different sensors of DAG in this study. The first sensor is based on a circularly permutated GFP placed between the pseudosubstrate domain and the DAG binding C1 domain of PKCδ (23Tewson P. Westenberg M. Zhao Y. Campbell R.E. Quinn A.M. Hughes T.E.

Quinn A.M. Hughes T.E. A multiplexed fluorescent assay for independent second-messenger systems: decoding GPCR activation in living cells.J. Biomol. Screen. 2013; 18 (23580666): 797-80610.1177/1087057113485427Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In our experiments, this sensor showed only a very small and transient increase in DAG levels in response to TRPV1 activation, whereas it showed a robust but still transient increase to M1 muscarinic receptor activation (Figure 3, Figure 4). The high-affinity GFP-PKD C1ab DAG probe has been shown to translocate to the plasma membrane in response to Gq-coupled receptor stimulation, application of diC8 DAG, and phorbol esters (17Kim Y.J. Guzman-Hernandez M.L. Balla T. A highly dynamic ER-derived phosphatidylinositol-synthesizing organelle supplies phosphoinositides to cellular membranes.Dev. Cell. 2011; 21 (22075145): 813-82410.1016/j.devcel.2011.09.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The GFP-PKD C1ab probe detected a clear increase in DAG levels in response to TRPV1 activation, which was smaller and more transient than that induced by muscarinic receptor activation (Fig. 5). In both cases, treating the cells with the DAGK inhibitor DK1 increased the DAG signal evoked by TRPV1 activation. This indicates that DAG is generated when TRPV1 is activated but that its levels are diminished by DAGK activation, making the signal small and transient. We studied TRPV1 desensitization using two consecutive capsaicin applications. During the first application of capsaicin, current levels decreased substantially despite the continuous presence of capsaicin; this decrease is often referred to as acute desensitization. The peak amplitude of the second capsaicin application is a lot smaller than that of the first one; this decrease in the response to the second application is sometimes referred to as tachyphylaxis. Although depletion of PI(4,5)P2 plays a crucial role in these phenomena (8Lukacs V. Yudin Y. Hammond G.R. Sharma E. Fukami K. Rohacs T.

It has not been tested whether common risk variants for generalized or focal epilepsy are enriched in people with other disorders or traits related to brain or cognitive function. Here, we perform two brain-focused phenome association studies of polygenic risk scores (PRS) for generalized epilepsy (GE-PRS) or focal epilepsy (FE-PRS) with all binary brain or cognitive function-related traits available for 334,310 European-ancestry individuals of the UK Biobank. Higher GE-PRS were associated with not having a college or university degree (P = 3.00x10-4), five neuroticism-related personality traits (P<2.51x10-4), and having ever smoked (P = 1.27x10-6). Higher FE-PRS were associated with several measures of low educational attainment (P<4.87x10-5), one neuroticism-related personality trait (P = 2.33x10-4), having ever smoked (P = 1.71x10-4), and having experienced events of anxiety or depression (P = 2.83x10-4). GE- and FE-PRS had the same direction of effect for each of the associated traits. Genetic factors associated with GE or FE showed similar patterns of correlation with genetic factors associated with cortical morphology in a subset of the UKB with 16,612 individuals and T1 magnetic resonance imaging data. In summary, our results suggest that genetic factors associated with epilepsies may confer risk for other neurological and psychiatric disorders in a population sample not enriched for epilepsy."
https://openalex.org/W3019345216,"Background High-throughput sequencing techniques are used to analyse the diversity of the respiratory microbiota in health and disease. Although extensive data are available regarding bacterial respiratory microbiota, its fungal component remains poorly studied. This is partly due to the technical issues associated with fungal metagenomics analyses. In this study, we compared two DNA extraction protocols and two fungal amplification targets for combined bacterial and fungal targeted amplicon sequencing analyses of the respiratory microbiota. Methods Six sputa, randomly selected from routine samples in Mondor Hospital (Creteil, France) and treated anonymously, were tested after bacterial and fungal routine culture. Two of which were spiked with Aspergillus Fumigati and Aspergillus Nigri (105 conidia/mL). After mechanical lysis, DNA was extracted using automated QIAsymphony® extraction (AQE) or manual PowerSoil® MoBio extraction (MPE). DNA yield and purity were compared. DNA extracted from spiked sputa was subjected to (i) real-time PCR for Aspergillus DNA detection and (ii) combined metagenomic analyses targeting barcoded primers for fungal ITS1 and ITS2, and bacterial V1-V2 and V3-V4 16S regions. Amplicon libraries were prepared using MiSeq Reagent V3 kit on Illumina platform. Data were analysed using PyroMIC© and SHAMAN software, and compared with culture results. Results AQE extraction provided a higher yield of DNA (AQE/MPE DNA ratio = 4.5 [1.3–11]) in a shorter time. The yield of Aspergillus DNA detected by qPCR was similar for spiked sputa regardless of extraction protocol. The extraction moderately impacted the diversity or relative abundances of bacterial communities using targeted amplicon sequencing (2/43 taxa impacted). For fungi, the relative abundances of 4/11 major taxa were impacted and AQE results were closer to culture results. The V1-V2 or V3-V4 and ITS1 or ITS2 targets assessed similarly the diversity of bacterial and fungal major taxa, but ITS2 and V3-V4 detected more minor taxa. Conclusion Our results showed the importance of DNA extraction for combined bacterial and fungal targeted metagenomics of respiratory samples. The extraction protocol can affect DNA yield and the relative abundances of few bacterial but more fungal taxa. For fungal analysis, ITS2 allowed the detection of a greater number of minor taxa compared with ITS1."

https://openalex.org/W3020147282,"To date, insect scale robots capable of controlled flight have used flapping-wings for generating lift, but this requires a complex and failure-prone mechanism. A simpler alternative is electrohydrodynamic (EHD) thrust, which requires no moving mechanical parts. In EHD, corona discharge generates a flow of ions in an electric field between two electrodes; the high-velocity ions transfer their kinetic energy to neutral air molecules through collisions, accelerating the gas and creating thrust. We introduce a fabrication process for EHD thruster based on 355 nm laser micromachining, which potentially allows for greater materials selection, such as fiber-based composites, than is possible with semiconductor-based lithographic processing. Our four-thruster device measures 1.8 × 2.5 cm and is composed of steel emitters and a lightweight carbon fiber mesh. We measured the electrical current and thrust of each thruster of our four-thruster design, showing agreement with the Townsend relation. The peak thrust of our device, at 5.2 kV, was measured to be 3.03 times its 37 mg (363.0 μN) mass using a precision balance. In free flight, we demonstrated liftoff at 4.6 kV."

Data on 663 participants was collected through a validated questionnaire prepared on the basis of WHO guidelines for the regulatory assessment of medicinal products for use in self-medication. Two trained data collectors visited the randomly selected community pharmacies, approached and interviewed the consumers purchasing medicines without prescriptions. Data was entered in SPSS and analyzed using descriptive and inferential analyses (alpha level = 0.05).Out of 663 respondents, 68.6% were university graduates; and 33.9% were healthcare professionals. Consumers preferred self-medication mainly for headache (85.8%), cold and sore throat (80.8%), cough (75.7%) and fever (71.8%) with the justification that these illnesses were minor (90.2%), time saving (82.2%), convenient (74.7%), quicker relief (66.1%), and economical (61.2%). Occupation was significantly associated with the reasons for preferring self-medication (p<0.001). Similarly, age, gender and education were also significantly associated with most of the reasons for opting self-medication. People were quite aware about harmful consequences of self-medication. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the respondents with lower education (AOR = 2.404 [95% CI: 1.579-3.661]), non-healthcare professionals (AOR = 1.712 [95% CI: 1.143-2.565]) and higher monthly income (AOR = 0.376 [95% CI: 0.236-0.599]) preferred self-medication (p <0.001, p = 0.009, p <0.001) respectively.Self-medication was prevalent among young university graduate males for minor ailments mainly due to convenience and time saving. Despite people beliefs about the harmful consequences of self-medication, its use was omnipresent particularly among the respondents with lower education, non-healthcare professionals and people with higher monthly income."

Their growth and development are affected by the nutrient contents of their host plants. In this study, we assessed the effects of different host plant nutrients on the nutrient contents of these two Bradysia species. The nutrients of the chive (Allium tuberosum Rottl. ex Spreng.), board bean (Vicia faba L.), lettuce (Lactuca sativa L. var. ramosa Hort.), cabbage (Brassica oleracea L.), wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata rubra) and pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) roots were determined, and their effect on nutrient content of the two Bradysia species after feeding on the host plant for three continuous generations were evaluated. The results show that chive and B-bean contained higher levels of protein, free amino acid, soluble sugar and starch than others. As a result, the soluble sugar, fat and protein contents were significantly higher in both Bradysia species reared on chive and B-bean than on cabbage, lettuce, W-cabbage and pepper, suggesting nutritional preference of these insects. Based on our results, we concluded that the two Bradysia species displayed nutrient preference toward chive and B-bean, which provides a reference for understanding their host plant range and for control of the insect species via field crop rotations."

https://openalex.org/W3020727095,"Small intestinal strangulation associated with ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) is common in horses. In laboratory animals IRI can be ameliorated by ischaemic preconditioning (IPC) and pharmacological preconditioning (PPC) with dexmedetomidine. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of PPC with dexmedetomidine or IPC in an equine model of small intestinal ischaemia-reperfusion (IR). In a randomized controlled experimental trial, 15 horses were assigned to three groups: control (C), IPC, and PPC with dexmedetomidine (DEX). All horses were placed under general anaesthesia and 90% jejunal ischaemia was induced for 90 minutes, followed 30 minutes of reperfusion. In group IPC, three short bouts of ischaemia and reperfusion were implemented, and group DEX received a continuous rate infusion of dexmedetomidine prior to the main ischaemia. Jejunal biopsies were collected before ischaemia (P), and at the end of ischaemia (I) and reperfusion (R). Mucosal injury was assessed by the Chiu-Score, inflammatory cells were stained by cytosolic calprotectin. The degree of apoptosis and cell necrosis was assessed by cleaved-caspase-3 and TUNEL. Parametric data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA for repeated measurements followed by Dunnetts t-test. Non parametric data were compared between groups at the different time points by a Kruskal-Wallis-Test and a Wilcoxon-2-Sample-test. The mucosal injury score increased during I in all groups. After reperfusion, IRI further progressed in group C, but not in IPC and DEX. In all groups the number of cleaved caspase-3 and TUNEL positive cells increased from P to I. The number of TUNEL positive cells were lower in group DEX compared to group C after I and R. Infiltration with calprotectin positive cells was less pronounced in group DEX compared to group C, whereas in group IPC more calprotectin positive cells were seen. In conclusion, IPC and DEX exert protective effects in experimental small intestinal ischaemia in horses."

Nuanced gendered perceptions and health behaviors of both women and men play a significant role in women’s health. Our study analyzed gender differences on perceptions of gender roles, discrimination, cancer attitudes, cancer stigma, and influences in healthcare decision making within our study population to inform ongoing cervical cancer prevention work in the rural region of Kédougou, Sénégal. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 158 participants, 101 women and 57 men (ages 30–59) across nine non-probability-sampled communities from October 2018 through February 2019. Bivariate analysis was conducted to assess gender differences across all variables. We also conducted analyses to determine whether there were significant differences in beliefs and attitudes, by screening behavior and by education. We found significant gender differences regarding the perception of a woman’s role (P < 0.001) and a man’s role (P = 0.007) as well as in the everyday discrimination questions of “decreased respect by spouse” (P < 0.001). Regarding cancer stigma, among women, 18.00% disagreed and 10.00% strongly disagreed while among men, 3.6% disagreed and 1.8% strongly disagreed that “If I had cancer, I would want my family to know that I have it.” When making decisions about one’s healthcare, women are more likely than men to trust social contacts such as their spouse (46.5% vs 5.3%, p < 0.001) while men are more likely than women to trust health service personnel such as a nurse (50.9% vs 18.8%, p < 0.001). Furthermore, men and women were both more likely to state that men have the final decision regarding the healthcare decisions of women (p < 0.001). Our data reveal structural disadvantages for women within our study population as well as gender differences in the adapted everyday discrimination scale and cancer stigma scale. Higher rates of both personal and perceived cancer stigma among women has profound implications for how population and community level communication strategies for cancer prevention and control should be designed. Efforts to advance the goal of the elimination of cervical cancer should, in the short-term, seek to gain a more profound understanding of the ways that gender, language, and other social determinants impact negative social influences and other barriers addressable through interventions. Social and behavior change communication may be one approach that can focus both on education while seeking to leverage the social influences that exist in achieving immediate and long-term goals."
https://openalex.org/W3017902363,"Metabolic Syndrome (MS) is characterized by a low-grade inflammatory state causing an alteration of non-invasive indexes derived from blood count, namely monocyte-to-HDL ratio (MHR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR). We analyse a population of 771 subjects (394 controls and 377 MS patients) to evaluate the best predictive index of MS. The diagnosis of MS was made according to the 2006 criteria of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF). We performed ROC curve analyses to evaluate the best predictor index of MS. MHR cut-off value was used to classify the population in two different groups and to create the outcome variable of the Recursive Partitioning and Amalgamation (RECPAM) analysis. This method is a tree-structured approach that defines ""risk profiles"" for each group of dichotomous variables. We showed that MHR index is significantly linked to body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, creatinine, C-reactive protein (CRP), Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR). ROC curve defined an MHR cut-off value of 6.4, which was able to identify two patient groups with significant differences in waist circumference, blood pressure, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate and fasting plasma glucose. RECPAM analysis demonstrated that gender, BMI categorization and hyperglycaemia were the most important risk determinants of increased MHR index that can be considered bona fide a useful and easily obtainable tool to suggest the presence of peculiar metabolic features that predict MS."
https://openalex.org/W3018264606,"Aggression between individuals of the same sex is almost ubiquitous across the animal kingdom. Winners of intrasexual contests often garner considerable fitness benefits, through greater access to mates, food, or social dominance. In females, aggression is often tightly linked to reproduction, with females displaying increases in aggressive behavior when mated, gestating or lactating, or when protecting dependent offspring. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, females spend twice as long fighting over food after mating as when they are virgins. However, it is unknown when this increase in aggression begins or whether it is consistent across genotypes. Here we show that aggression in females increases between 2 to 4 hours after mating and remains elevated for at least a week after a single mating. In addition, this increase in aggression 24 hours after mating is consistent across three diverse genotypes, suggesting this may be a universal response to mating in the species. We also report here the first use of automated tracking and classification software to study female aggression in Drosophila and assess its accuracy for this behavior. Dissecting the genetic diversity and temporal patterns of female aggression assists us in better understanding its generality and adaptive function, and will facilitate the identification of its underlying mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3018345578,"Background Elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels in secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) lead to vascular calcification, which is associated with cardiovascular events and mortality. Increased PTH production is caused by the excessive proliferation of parathyroid gland cells, which is accelerated by abnormal mineral homeostasis. Evocalcet, an oral calcimimetic agent, inhibits the secretion of PTH from parathyroid gland cells and has been used for the management of SHPT in dialysis patients. We observed the effects of evocalcet on ectopic calcification and parathyroid hyperplasia using chronic kidney disease (CKD) rats with SHPT. Methods CKD rats with SHPT induced by adenine received evocalcet orally for 5 weeks. The calcium and inorganic phosphorus content in the aorta, heart and kidney was measured. Ectopic calcified tissues were also assessed histologically. To observe the effects on the proliferation of parathyroid gland cells, parathyroid glands were histologically assessed in CKD rats with SHPT induced by 5/6 nephrectomy (Nx) after receiving evocalcet orally for 4 weeks. Results Evocalcet prevented the increase in calcium and inorganic phosphorus content in the ectopic tissues and suppressed calcification of the aorta, heart and kidney in CKD rats with SHPT by reducing the serum PTH and calcium levels. Evocalcet suppressed the parathyroid gland cell proliferation and reduced the sizes of parathyroid cells in CKD rats with SHPT. Conclusions These findings suggest that evocalcet would prevent ectopic calcification and suppress parathyroid hyperplasia in patients with SHPT."

Epitomized by UNICEF’s “Likes Don’t Save Lives” campaign, the threat of slacktivism has led some organizations to forsake social media as a potential platform for garnering commitment. We proposed and investigated a novel e-pledging method that may enable organizations to capitalize on the benefits of e-pledging without compromising on its mass outreach potential. In two pilot studies, we first explored whether and why conventional e-pledges may not be as effective as intended. Building on those insights, we conducted one field and two lab experiments to test our proposed e-pledge intervention. Importantly, the field study demonstrated the effectiveness of the intervention for commitment behavior across a 3-month period. The laboratory experiments provided a deeper and more refined mechanism understanding of the effect and ruled out effort, novelty, and social interaction mindset as alternative explanations for why the intervention may be effective. As technological innovations continue to redefine how people interact with the world, this research sheds light on a promising method for transforming a simple virtual acknowledgment into deeper commitment—and, ideally, to action."
https://openalex.org/W3018197558,"Marine vegetated ecosystems such as seagrass meadows are increasingly acknowledged as important carbon sinks based on their ability to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation. Most studies on carbon storage in marine ecosystems have focused on organic carbon, leaving inorganic carbon processes such as calcification unaccounted for, despite of their critical role in the global carbon budget. This is probably because of uncertainties regarding the role of calcification in marine carbon budgets as either atmospheric CO2 source or sink. Here, we conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate the influence of a calcifying alga (Corallina officinalis L.) on seawater carbon content, using a non-calcifying alga (Ulva lactuca L.) as a control. In a first part, algae were incubated separately while measuring changes in seawater pH, total alkalinity (TA) and total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The amount of carbon used in photosynthetic uptake and production of CaCO3 was then calculated. In a second, directly following, part the algae were removed and DIC levels were allowed to equilibrate with air until the pH stabilized and the loss of CO2 to air was calculated as the difference in total DIC from the start of part one, to the end of the second part. The results showed that C. officinalis caused a significant and persistent reduction in total dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), TA and seawater pH, while no such permanent changes were caused by U. lactuca. These findings indicate that calcification can release a significant amount of CO2 to the atmosphere and thereby possibly counteract the carbon sequestration in marine vegetated ecosystems if this CO2 is not re-fixed in the system. Our research emphasises the importance of considering algal calcification in future assessments on carbon storage in coastal areas."

Small communities up to about 40 in size can be managed democratically, but all larger communities require a leadership team structure.

https://openalex.org/W3018377726,"How well L2 English is understood and how L2 English speakers perceive one another within varying communication contexts has been studied relatively rarely, even though most speakers of English in the world are L2 speakers. In this matched-guise experiment (N = 1699) the effects of L1 and L2 English accents and communication context were tested on speech understandability (intelligibility, comprehensibility, interpretability) and speaker evaluations (status, affect, dynamism). German (N = 617), Spanish (N = 540), and Singaporean listeners (N = 542) were asked to evaluate three accents (Dutch-accented English, standard British English, standard American English) in three communication contexts (Lecture, Audio Tour, Job Pitch). The main finding is that the Dutch-accented English accent was understood as well as the two L1 English accents. Furthermore, Dutch-accented English evoked equally positive evaluations to the two L1 English accents in German listeners, and more positive evaluations than the two L1 English accents in Spanish and Singaporean listeners. These results suggest that accent training aimed at achieving an L1 English accent may not always be necessary for (Dutch) English language learners, especially when they are expected to mostly interact with other L2 speakers of English. More generally, our results indicate that L2 English speakers' understanding and their evaluation of L1 and L2 Englishes would not seem to reflect traditional language norms. Instead, they seem to reflect the socio-cultural embedding of a language norm in a Lingua Franca English speech community that does not view accent varieties as a hindrance to successful communication."
https://openalex.org/W3018592670,"Background The overall aim was to investigate the change over time in circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) in patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing concurrent chemo-radiotherapy. Furthermore, to assess the possibility of detecting circulating cell free tumor DNA (ctDNA) using shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) and size selection. Methods Ten patients were included in a two-phase study. The first four patients had blood samples taken prior to a radiation therapy (RT) dose fraction and at 30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours after RT to estimate the short-term dynamics of cfDNA concentration after irradiation. The remaining six patients had one blood sample taken on six treatment days 30 minutes post treatment to measure cfDNA levels. Presence of ctDNA as indicated by chromosomal aberrations was investigated using sWGS. The sensitivity of this method was further enhanced using in silico size selection. Results cfDNA concentration from baseline to 120 min after therapy was stable within 95% tolerance limits of +/- 2 ng/ml cfDNA. Changes in cfDNA were observed during therapy with an apparent qualitative difference between adenocarcinoma (average increase of 0.69 ng/ml) and squamous cell carcinoma (average increase of 4.0 ng/ml). Tumor shrinkage on daily cone beam computer tomography scans during radiotherapy did not correlate with changes in concentration of cfDNA. Conclusion Concentrations of cfDNA remain stable during the first 2 hours after an RT fraction. However, based on the sWGS profiles, ctDNA represented only a minor fraction of cfDNA in this group of patients. The detection sensitivity of genomic alterations in ctDNA strongly increases by applying size selection."

We assessed the association between the time in therapeutic range (TTR) of vitamin-K antagonist (VKA) treatment and incidence of CTEPH after a PE diagnosis. Methods Case-control study in which the time spent in, under and above therapeutic range was calculated in 44 PE patients who were subsequently diagnosed with CTEPH (cases). Controls comprised 150 consecutive PE patients in whom echocardiograms two years later did not show pulmonary hypertension. All patients were treated with VKA for at least 6 months after the PE diagnosis. Time in (TTR), under and above range were calculated. Mean differences between cases and controls were estimated by linear regression. Results Mean TTR during the initial 6-month treatment period was 72% in cases versus 78% in controls (mean difference -6%, 95%CI -12 to -0.1), mainly explained by more time above the therapeutic range in the cases. Mean difference of time under range was 0% (95%CI -6 to 7) and 2% (95CI% -3 to 7) during the first 3 and 6 months, respectively. In a multivariable model, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for CTEPH were around unity considering different thresholds for ‘poor anticoagulation’, i.e. TTR <50%, <60% and <70%. Conclusion Subtherapeutic initial anticoagulation was not more prevalent among PE patients diagnosed with CTEPH than in those who did not develop CTEPH."
https://openalex.org/W3017951432,"To examine associations between receipt of an electronic food voucher (e-voucher) compared to food rations on the nutritional status of Rohingya children living in refugee camps in Bangladesh.This is an associational study using cross-sectional data. We measured heights and weights of 523 children aged between 6 and 23 months in households receiving either a food ration consisting of rice, pulses, vegetable oil (362 children) or an e-voucher (161 children) that could be used to purchase 19 different foods. Data were also collected on the characteristics of their mothers and the households in which they lived, including household demographics, consumption and expenditure, coping strategies, livelihoods and income profiles, and access to assistance. Associations between measures of anthropometric status (height-for-age z scores, stunting, weight-for-height z scores, wasting, weight-for-age z scores and mid-upper arm circumference) and household receipt of the e-voucher were estimated using ordinary least squares regressions. Control variables included child, maternal, household and locality characteristics. The study received ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board of the International Food Policy Research Institute, Washington DC.Household receipt of an e-voucher was associated with improved linear growth in children. This association is robust to the inclusion of maternal, household and location characteristics. The magnitude of the association is 0.38 SD (CI: 0.01, 0.74), and statistically significant at the five percent level. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that these associations differ by child sex. Receipt of an e-voucher is not associated with stunting when a full set of control variables are included. There is no association between receipt of e-vouchers and weight-for-length, weight-for-age or mid-upper arm circumference. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that these associations differ by child sex.In a humanitarian assistance setting, Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, household receipt of an electronic food voucher instead of a food ration is associated with improvements in the linear growth of children between 6 and 23 months but not in measures of acute undernutrition or other anthropometric outcomes. Our associational evidence indicates that transitioning from food rations to electronic food vouchers does not adversely affect child nutritional status."
https://openalex.org/W3019903117,"Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a major cardiovascular risk factor, which is largely genetically determined by one major gene locus, the LPA gene. Many aspects of the transcriptional regulation of LPA are poorly understood and the role of epigenetics has not been addressed yet. Therefore, we conducted an epigenome-wide analysis of DNA methylation on Lp(a) levels in two population-based studies (total n = 2208). We identified a CpG site in the LPA promoter which was significantly associated with Lp(a) concentrations. Surprisingly, the identified CpG site was found to overlap the SNP rs76735376. We genotyped this SNP de-novo in three studies (total n = 7512). The minor allele of rs76735376 (1.1% minor allele frequency) was associated with increased Lp(a) values (p = 1.01e-59) and explained 3.5% of the variation of Lp(a). Statistical mediation analysis showed that the effect on Lp(a) is rather originating from the base change itself and is not mediated by DNA methylation levels. This finding is supported by eQTL data from 208 liver tissue samples from the GTEx project, which shows a significant association of the rs76735376 minor allele with increased LPA expression. To evaluate, whether the association signal at rs76735376 may actually be derived from a stronger eQTL signal in LD with this SNP, eQTL association results of all correlated SNPs (r2≥0.1) were integrated with genetic association results. This analysis pinpointed to rs10455872 as the potential trigger of the effect of rs76735376. Furthermore, both SNPs coincide with short apo(a) isoforms. Adjusting for both, rs10455872 and the apo(a) isoforms diminished the effect size of rs76735376 to 5.38 mg/dL (p = 0.0463). This indicates that the effect of rs76735376 can be explained by both an independent effect of the SNP and a strong correlation with rs10455872 and apo(a) isoforms."

Five mice underwent IP injection of 5x106 ID8-luc cells (+ D- luciferin) and the remaining five mice underwent IP injection of ID8-VEGF cells. Monitoring of tumor growth and ascites was performed weekly starting at seven days post-injection until study endpoint. ID8-luc mice were monitored using both TAUS and IVIS, and ID8-VEGF mice underwent TAUS monitoring only. Individual tumor implant dimension and total tumor volume were calculated. Average luminescent intensity was calculated and reported per mouse abdomen. Tumor detection was confirmed by gross evaluation and histopathology. All data are presented as mean +/- standard deviation.Overall, tumors were successfully detected in all ten mice using TAUS and IVIS, and tumor detection correlated with terminal endpoint histology/ H&E staining. For TAUS, the smallest confirmed tumor measurements were at seven days post-injection with mean long axis of 2.23mm and mean tumor volume of 4.17mm3. However, IVIS imaging was able to detect tumor growth at 14 days post-injection. Ascites formation was detected in mice at 21 days post-injection.TAUS is highly discriminatory for monitoring EOC in pre-clinical murine model, allowing for detection of tumor dimension as small as 2 mm and as early as seven days post-injection compared to IVIS. In addition, TAUS provides relevant information for ascites development and detection of multiple small metastatic tumor implants. TAUS provides an accurate and reliable method to detect and monitor IP EOC growth in mouse xenografts."
https://openalex.org/W3018230200,"Reducing carbohydrates digestion by having a low glycaemic index (GI) foods has been linked to weight loss. Inhibiting related enzymes is an alternative way to decrease carbohydrate digestion. RCM-107 (Slimming Plus), an eight-herb formula that is modified from RCM-104, indicated significant weight-loss action in clinical trials. However, no published research has studied its mechanism of action on reducing carbohydrate absorption via suppressing the activities of porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase (PPA). In this paper, we used fluorescence PPA inhibition assay to investigate the inhibitory effects of RCM-107 and the individual herbs present in this herbal mixture on amylase activity. Subsequently, molecular docking predicted the key active compounds that may be responsible for the enzyme inhibition. According to our results, both the RCM-107 formula and several individual herbs displayed α-amylase inhibitory effects. Also, marginal synergistic effects of RCM-107 were detected. In addition, alisol B, (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and plantagoside have been predicted as the key active compounds that may be responsible for the α-amylase inhibition effect of RCM-107 according to inter-residue contact analysis. Finally, Glu233, Gln63, His305, Asp300 and Tyr151 are predicted to be markers of important areas with which potential amylase inhibitors would interact. Therefore, our data has provided new knowledge on the mechanisms of action of the RCM-107 formula and its individual herbal ingredients for weight loss, in terms of decreasing carbohydrate digestion via the inhibition of pancreatic alpha-amylase."
https://openalex.org/W3018522237,"Grey mould is caused by the ascomycetes Botrytis cinerea in a range of crop hosts. As a biological control agent, the nucleoside antibiotic wuyiencin has been industrially produced and widely used as an effective fungicide. To elucidate the effects of wuyiencin on the transcriptional regulation in B. cinerea, we, for the first time, report a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis of B. cinerea treated with wuyiencin. 2067 genes were differentially expressed, of them, 886 and 1181 genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Functional categorization indicated that transcript levels of genes involved in amino acid metabolism and those encoding putative secreted proteins were altered in response to wuyiencin treatment. Moreover, the expression of genes involved in protein synthesis and energy metabolism (oxidative phosphorylation) and of those encoding ATP-binding cassette transporters was markedly upregulated, whereas that of genes participating in DNA replication, cell cycle, and stress response was downregulated. Furthermore, wuyiencin resulted in mycelial malformation and negatively influenced cell growth rate and conidial yield in B. cinerea. Our results suggest that this nucleoside antibiotic regulates all aspects of cell growth and differentiation in B. cinerea. To summarize, some new candidate pathways and target genes that may related to the protective and antagonistic mechanisms in B. cinerea were identified underlying the action of biological control agents."
https://openalex.org/W3018968689,"Background/aim The magnitude of the postoperative systemic inflammatory response (SIR) is now recognised to be associated with both short and long-term outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for colon cancer. During such surgery, it is unclear whether the anaesthetic regimens influence the magnitude of the postoperative SIR, independent of other factors. The aim of the present study was to examine the association between anaesthetic agents, clinicopathological characteristics and the magnitude of the postoperative SIR in patients undergoing elective surgery for colon cancer. Methods Patients with colon cancer who underwent elective open or laparoscopic surgery between 2008 and 2016 (n = 409) were studied at a single center. The relationship between type of anaesthesia, surgical technique; open (n = 241) versus laparoscopic (n = 168) and clinicopathological characteristics was examined by using chi-square testing. The chi-square test was used to determine which anaesthetic group influences the POD 2 CRP for only patients undergoing elective open colon surgery. Results The majority of patients were <75 years old, male, normal weight or obese, underwent open surgery and had regional anaesthesia, in particular an epidural approach. There was a significant association between type of anaesthesia and post-operative CRP on day 2 (p <0.001) in patients undergoing open surgery but not laparoscopic surgery. Other factors associated with type of anaesthesia included; year of operation (p <0.01), surgical technique (p <0.001), and preoperative dexamethasone (p <0.01). Conclusion In patients undergoing surgery for elective colon cancer, the type of anaesthesia varied over time. The type of anaesthesia appears to influence the magnitude of the postoperative SIR on post-operative day 2 in open surgery but not laparoscopic surgery. Future work using prospective study design is required to better define this relationship."
https://openalex.org/W3017604968,"We have recently demonstrated that collagenolytic Enterococcus faecalis plays a key and causative role in the pathogenesis of anastomotic leak, an uncommon but potentially lethal complication characterized by disruption of the intestinal wound following segmental removal of the colon (resection) and its reconnection (anastomosis). Here we hypothesized that comparative genetic analysis of E. faecalis isolates present at the anastomotic wound site before and after surgery would shed insight into the mechanisms by which collagenolytic strains are selected for and predominate at sites of anastomotic disruption. Whole genome optical mapping of four pairs of isolates from rat colonic tissue obtained following surgical resection (herein named “pre-op” isolates) and then 6 days later from the anastomotic site (herein named “post-op” isolates) demonstrated that the isolates with higher collagenolytic activity formed a distinct cluster. In order to perform analysis at a deeper level, a single pair of E. faecalis isolates (16A pre-op and 16A post-op) was selected for whole genome sequencing and assembled using a hybrid assembly algorithm. Comparative genomics demonstrated absence of multiple gene clusters, notably a pathogenicity island in the post-op isolate. No differences were found in the fsr-gelE-sprE genes (EF1817-1822) responsible for regulation and production of collagenolytic activity. Analysis of unique genes among the 16A pre-op and post-op isolates revealed the predominance of transporter systems-related genes in the pre-op isolate and phage-related and hydrolytic enzyme-encoding genes in the post-op isolate. Despite genetic differences observed between pre-op and post-op isolates, the precise genetic determinants responsible for their differential expression of collagenolytic activity remains unknown."

GA homeostasis is achieved via complex biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, whose exact activities remain to be elucidated. Here, we isolated two cDNAs from mature or imbibed cucumber seeds with high sequence similarity to known GA 3-oxidases. We found that one enzyme (designated here CsGA3ox5) has GA 3-oxidation activity. However, the second enzyme (designated CsGA1ox/ds) performed multiple reactions, including 1β-oxidation and 9,11-desaturation of GAs, but was lacking the 3-oxidation activity. CsGA1ox/ds overexpression in Arabidopsis plants resulted in severely dwarfed plants that could be rescued by the exogenous application of bioactive GA4, confirming that CsGA1ox/ds catabolizes GAs. Substitution of three amino acids in CsGA1ox/ds, Phe93, Pro106, and Ser202, with those typically conserved among GA 3-oxidases, Tyr93, Met106, and Thr202, respectively, conferred GA 3-oxidase activity to CsGA1ox/ds and thereby augmented its potential to form bioactive GAs in addition to catabolic products. Accordingly, overexpression of this amino acid–modified GA1ox/ds variant in Arabidopsis accelerated plant growth and development, indicating that this enzyme variant can produce bioactive GAs in planta. Furthermore, a genetically modified GA3ox5 variant in which these three canonical GA 3-oxidase amino acids were changed to the ones present in CsGA1ox/ds was unable to convert GA9 to GA4, highlighting the importance of these three conserved amino acids for GA 3-oxidase activity.

https://openalex.org/W3020376337,"Canine osteosarcoma (OSA), the most common canine primary bone malignancy, has a highly aggressive biologic behavior. Despite current standard of care therapies, including amputation and adjuvant chemotherapy, most dogs still succumb to metastatic disease. Further investigations into molecular mechanisms and pathways driving OSA are needed to improve therapeutic options. The Hedgehog (HH) cell-signaling pathway has demonstrated involvement in human OSA. Several studies in canine OSA have found changes in expression of some HH pathway genes and demonstrated a role for HH transcription factors. However, the role of this pathway as well as the translational value of its targeting in canine OSA are still undefined. The objectives of this study were to determine the expression of HH components directly in canine OSA tissues and to evaluate the biologic impact of HH signaling inhibition in canine OSA cells. In situ hybridization was used to detect HH family mRNA expression in archived canine OSA tissues and revealed variable expression levels of these mRNAs in canine OSA tissues. The effect of a commercially available Smoothened inhibitor, vismodegib, was studied in established canine OSA cell lines. Alterations in cellular growth as well as assessment of downstream HH targets were evaluated. Although changes in cell growth were noted following Smoothened inhibition, inconsistent decreases in target gene expression were found. While treatment with vismodegib had a negative impact on canine OSA cell growth and viability, the mechanism remains unclear. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the clinical significance of canonical HH signaling in canine OSA."
https://openalex.org/W3020708175,"There is an unmet need for treatments for diseases associated with aging. The antiaging, life-extending, and cognition-enhancing protein Klotho is neuroprotective due to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and pro-myelinating effects. In addition, Klotho is also a tumor suppressor and has beneficial roles in multiple organs. Klotho is downregulated as part of the aging process. Thus, upregulating Klotho in the brain may lead to novel therapeutics to people suffering or at risk for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. We attempted to upregulate Klotho for its beneficial effects in the brain and elsewhere. Here, we describe a method to specifically activate Klotho gene expression. To accomplish this task, we designed zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) targeting within −300 bps of the human Klotho promoter. We designed the ZPF constructs either de novo from modular building blocks, or modified sequences from the natural endogenous Egr1 transcription factor backbone structure. Egr1 is known to upregulate Klotho expression. We tested the transcriptional activation effects of these ZFPs in a dual luciferase coincidence reporter system under the control of 4-kb promoter of human Klotho in stable HEK293 cells and in HK-2 cells that express Klotho protein endogenously. We found that the best ZFPs are the de novo designed ones targeting −250 bps of Klotho promoter and one of the Egr1-binding sites. We further enhanced Klotho's activation using p65-Rta transcriptional activation domains in addition to VP64. These upregulation approaches could be useful for studying Klotho's protective effects and designing Klotho boosting therapeutics for future in vivo experiments."
https://openalex.org/W3017700903,"Accurate RNA quantification at the single-cell level is critical for understanding the dynamics of gene expression and regulation across space and time. Single molecule FISH (smFISH), such as RNAscope, provides spatial and quantitative measurements of individual transcripts, therefore, can be used to explore differential gene expression among a heterogeneous cell population if combined with cell identify information. However, such analysis is not straightforward, and existing image analysis pipelines cannot integrate both RNA transcripts and cellular staining information to automatically output cell type-specific gene expression. We developed an efficient and customizable analysis method, Single-Molecule Automatic RNA Transcription Quantification (SMART-Q), to enable the analysis of gene transcripts in a cell type-specific manner. SMART-Q efficiently infers cell identity information from multiplexed immuno-staining and quantifies cell type-specific transcripts using a 3D Gaussian fitting algorithm. Furthermore, we have optimized SMART-Q for user experiences, such as flexible parameters specification, batch data outputs, and visualization of analysis results. SMART-Q meets the demands for efficient quantification of single-molecule RNA and can be widely used for cell type-specific RNA transcript analysis."

https://openalex.org/W3019613005,"Many proteins exist in natures as oligomers with various quaternary structural attributes rather than as single chains. Predicting these attributes is an essential task in computational biology for the advancement of proteomics. However, the existing methods do not consider the integration of heterogeneous coding and the accuracy of subunit categories with limited data. To this end, we proposed a tool that can predict more than 12 subunit protein oligomers, QUATgo. Meanwhile, three kinds of sequence coding were used, including dipeptide composition, which was used for the first time to predict protein quaternary structural attributes, and protein half-life characteristics, and we modified the coding method of the functional domain composition proposed by predecessors to solve the problem of large feature vectors. QUATgo solves the problem of insufficient data for a single subunit using a two-stage architecture and uses 10-fold cross-validation to test the predictive accuracy of the classifier. QUATgo has 49.0% cross-validation accuracy and 31.1% independent test accuracy. In the case study, the accuracy of QUATgo can reach 61.5% for predicting the quaternary structure of influenza virus hemagglutinin proteins. Finally, QUATgo is freely accessible to the public as a web server via the site http://predictor.nchu.edu.tw/QUATgo."
