https://openalex.org/W2042917522,An anticyclonic lens of water in the permanent thermocline off the Bahamas has water mass characteristics representing Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic central waters. This eddy's ability to translate across the Atlantic without losing its identity points to baroclinic eddies as a specific mechanism for large-scale mixing.
https://openalex.org/W2010472784,"An enzyme extracted from marine red algae, Bonnemaisonia hamifera, is capable of incorporating bromine into a number of organic substrates in the pH range 5 to 8. At pH 7.3, incubation of partially purified preparations of bromoperoxidase with hydrogen peroxide, bromide ion, and 3-oxooctanoic acid leads to the formation of three volatile brominated hydrocarbons: dibromomethane, bromoform, and 1-pentyl bromide. The presence of significant quantities of halometabolites including volatile halohydrocarbons in marine organisms, ocean waters, and the upper atmosphere may result from peroxidase-catalyzed halogenation reactions."

These results, which are in contradiction with quantum electrodynamics, support the theory of unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces. The interpretation of these experimental results is based on exchanges of weak neutral Z(0) bosons between the electrons and the nucleus of the atom. The information obtained from low-energy experiments is different from, but complementary to, the results of high-energy experiments. Sensitive measurements in a simple, reliably computable atom are in quantitative agreement with the standard electroweak theory and put stringent constraints on alternative models. Attaining sufficient accuracy in the experiments and the computations for the electroweak radiative corrections to manifest themselves is now the challenge for experimenters and theorists."

https://openalex.org/W2081059324,In 1612 the sun's mean sidereal rotation rate was only 13.3 degrees per day based on a series of 199 unpublished drawings by Harriot. By comparison with the rates in 1625 to 1626 and 1642 to 1644 it appears that the solar rotation was accelerating significantly in the cycles leading up to the Maunder minimum.

Companies are finding that they must be driven by market opportunities and financial needs, not by regulatory considerations. Prices must be based on cost, operations must become more efficient, and consumer-oriented product niches must be found. Moreover, deregulation has added a new element in industrial dynamics, by fostering more relations between the various modes of transportation and by cross-fertilization in computer and telecommunication technology. All in all, a more competitive and innovative spirit emerges from deregulation."
https://openalex.org/W2093695931,Phloem tissue of the Pennsylvanian fern Etapteris is described from permineralized specimens. Sieve elements possess regularly aligned sieve areas containing pores on the radial walls. The presence of these structures provides a basis for comparison with the phloem of living ferns.
