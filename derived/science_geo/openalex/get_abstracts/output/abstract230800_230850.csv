https://openalex.org/W2144189317,"The carbon sink capacity of the world's agricultural and degraded soils is 50 to 66% of the historic carbon loss of 42 to 78 gigatons of carbon. The rate of soil organic carbon sequestration with adoption of recommended technologies depends on soil texture and structure, rainfall, temperature, farming system, and soil management. Strategies to increase the soil carbon pool include soil restoration and woodland regeneration, no-till farming, cover crops, nutrient management, manuring and sludge application, improved grazing, water conservation and harvesting, efficient irrigation, agroforestry practices, and growing energy crops on spare lands. An increase of 1 ton of soil carbon pool of degraded cropland soils may increase crop yield by 20 to 40 kilograms per hectare (kg/ha) for wheat, 10 to 20 kg/ha for maize, and 0.5 to 1 kg/ha for cowpeas. As well as enhancing food security, carbon sequestration has the potential to offset fossilfuel emissions by 0.4 to 1.2 gigatons of carbon per year, or 5 to 15% of the global fossil-fuel emissions."
https://openalex.org/W1553650702,"Understanding the suppression of ferroelectricity in perovskite thin films is a fundamental issue that has remained unresolved for decades. We report a synchrotron x-ray study of lead titanate as a function of temperature and film thickness for films as thin as a single unit cell. At room temperature, the ferroelectric phase is stable for thicknesses down to 3 unit cells (1.2 nanometers). Our results imply that no thickness limit is imposed on practical devices by an intrinsic ferroelectric size effect."
https://openalex.org/W2072705074,"Chitin is a surface component of parasites and insects, and chitinases are induced in lower life forms during infections with these agents. Although chitin itself does not exist in humans, chitinases are present in the human genome. We show here that acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) is induced via a T helper-2 (Th2)–specific, interleukin-13 (IL-13)–mediated pathway in epithelial cells and macrophages in an aeroallergen asthma model and expressed in exaggerated quantities in human asthma. AMCase neutralization ameliorated Th2 inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness, in part by inhibiting IL-13 pathway activation and chemokine induction. AMCase may thus be an important mediator of IL-13–induced responses in Th2-dominated disorders such as asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2055893161,"Reduced activity of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling (IIS) pathway increases life-span in diverse organisms. We investigated the timing of the effect of reduced IIS on life-span and the role of a potential target tissue, the fat body. We overexpressed dFOXO, a downstream effector of IIS, in the adult Drosophila fat body, which increased life-span and reduced fecundity of females but had no effect on male life-span. The role of FOXO transcription factors and the adipose tissue are therefore evolutionarily conserved in the regulation of aging, and reduction of IIS in the adult is sufficient to mediate its effects on life-span and fecundity."

Rico knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those items right away as well as 4 weeks after the initial exposure. Fast mapping thus appears to be mediated by general learning and memory mechanisms also found in other animals and not by a language acquisition device that is special to humans."
https://openalex.org/W1970629236,"The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily contains a large number of proteins encoding cation permeable channels that are further divided into TRPC (canonical), TRPM (melastatin), and TRPV (vanilloid) subfamilies. Among the six TRPV members, TRPV1, TRPV2, TRPV3, and TRPV4 form heat-activated cation channels, which serve diverse functions ranging from nociception to osmolality regulation. Although chemical activators for TRPV1 and TRPV4 are well documented, those for TRPV2 and TRPV3 are lacking. Here we show that in the absence of other stimuli, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2APB) activates TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3, but not TRPV4, TRPV5, and TRPV6 expressed in HEK293 cells. In contrast, 2APB inhibits the activity of TRPC6 and TRPM8 evoked by 1-oleolyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and menthol, respectively. In addition, low levels of 2APB strongly potentiate the effect of capsaicin, protons, and heat on TRPV1 as well as that of heat on TRPV3 expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In dorsal root ganglia neurons, supra-additive stimulations were evoked by 2APB and capsaicin or 2APB and acid. Our data suggest the existence of a common activation mechanism for TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPV3 that may serve as a therapeutic target for pain management and treatment for diseases caused by hypersensitivity and temperature misregulation.

According to sequence similarities, the TRP channels are further divided into subfamilies, such as TRPC (canonical), TRPM (melastatin), and TRPV (vanilloid) (see reviews in Refs. 1Clapham D.E.

Skryma R. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The mechanism of action for 2APB is likely to be complex. In addition to inhibition, low concentrations of 2APB enhanced the activity of store-operated channels (26Prakriya M. Lewis R.S. J. Physiol. 2001; 536: 3-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). At greater than 50 μm, 2APB activated a Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel with a 50-picosiemens single channel conductance and very low open probability in rat basophilic leukemia cells (31Braun F.J. Aziz O. Putney Jr., J.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 2APB has been perceived as a general inhibitor of TRP channels (1Clapham D.E. Runnels L.W. Strubing C. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 387-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). However, except for TRPC3 (24Ma H.T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), of which the molecular compositions are uncertain. It is possible that an unknown subunit confers the 2APB sensitivity of the native channels. Therefore, it is important to confirm the effects of 2APB on heterologously expressed TRP channels. Here, we used TRPC6, TRPM8, and TRPV1 to represent each of the three major TRP subfamilies and examined the effects of 2APB on their activities. We confirmed that TRPC6 and TRPM8 were inhibited by 2APB. However, to our surprise, 2APB activated TRPV1 expressed in HEK293 cells and in Xenopus oocytes. In rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, 2APB elicited currents that were potentiated by capsaicin or low pH. Finally, we showed that 2APB also activated TRPV2 and V3 and therefore is a common activator of three TRPV channels. DNA Constructs, Cell Culture, and Transfections—cDNA for murine TRPC6 was cloned as previously described (36Boulay G. Zhu X. Peyton M. Jiang M. Hurst R. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29672-29680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). cDNAs for murine TRPV1 (GenBank™ accession number AY452083) and TRPM8, murine TRPV3, and human TRPV4 were isolated from total RNA prepared from mouse DRG, mouse skin, and human endothelial cells, respectively, by reverse transcriptase-PCR using oligonucleotide primers designed based on published sequences. The correctness of the cDNAs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. cDNAs for rat TRPV1, murine TRPV2, and rat TRPV5 and TRPV6 were kindly provided by Drs. M. Caterina, M. Kanzaki, and J. Peng. For expression in HEK293 cells and intracellular Ca2+ measurements, the cDNAs were subcloned in pcDNA3. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. For intracellular Ca2+ measurements, the cells were transfected with the desired DNA constructs in the wells of 96-well plates without preseeding using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. To prevent cell loss from subsequent washing, the wells were treated with 20 μg/ml polyornithine (molecular weight >30,000; Sigma) for >15 min and rinsed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution without Mg2+ and Ca2+. For each well, the plasmid DNA (25 ng) and LipofectAMINE 2000 (0.4 μl) were mixed in 50 μl of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) and added to the well before the addition of 120,000 cells suspended in 100 μl of the medium without antibiotics. The cells were incubated for 24–28 h without medium change. The transfection efficiency was about 70% as determined using an enhanced green fluorescence protein expression vector. For whole cell recordings, murine TRPV1, V3, and M8 were subcloned in the bicistronic expression vector, pIRES2-EGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). TRPC6 was subcloned in pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) and expressed as a green fluorescent protein fusion protein. The transfections were performed in 35-mm dishes using LipofectAMINE 2000. For expression in Xenopus oocytes, murine TRPV1 and V3 were subcloned into the pAGA3 vector (GenBank™ accession number AY452085). Whole Cell Recordings of HEK293 Cells—Transfected HEK293 cells were reseeded in 35-mm dishes 1 day after the transfection. Whole cell recordings were performed in the following day. Recording pipettes were pulled from micropipette glass (World Precision Instruments Inc, Sarasota, FL) to 2–4 MΩ when filled with a pipette solution containing 140 mm CsCl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.20, and placed in the bath solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.40. Isolated cells were voltage-clamped in the whole cell mode using an EPC9 (HEKA Instruments Inc, Southboro, MA) amplifier. For TRPC6, the bath solution was changed to an external solution containing 160 mm NaCl, 7.2 mmN-methyl-d-glucamine, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, after the establishment of the whole cell configuration to facilitate the detection of the TRPC6 currents. Voltage commands were made from the Pulse+Pulse Fit program (version 8.53, HEKA), and the currents were recorded at 5 kHz. Voltage ramps of 100 ms to +100 mV after a brief (20 ms) step to -100 mV from holding potential of 0 mV were applied every 0.5 s. The cells were continuously perfused with the bath solution through a gravity-driven multioutlet device with the desired outlet placed about 50 μm away from the cell being recorded. Stock solutions of 2APB, N-arachidonyl dopamine, capsaicin, capsazepine, menthol, 1-oleolyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), and resiniferatoxin were made in Me2SO. Ruthenium red was dissolved in water. Drugs were diluted in the appropriate external solutions to the desired final concentrations and applied to the cell through perfusion. The acidic solution used for TRPV1 contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm MES, pH 6.50. All of the whole cell experiments were performed at the room temperature (20–24 °C). Intracellular Ca2+Measurements—Transiently transfected HEK 293 cells in 96-well plates were washed once with an extracellular solution (ECS) containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 15 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and then incubated in 50 μl of ECS supplemented with 2 μm fluo4/AM and 0.05% Pluronic F-127 (both were from Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) at 37 °C for 60 min. Probenecid (2 mm) was included in all of the solutions to prevent the leakage of fluo4 from the cells. At the end of the incubation, the cells were washed three times with ECS and placed in 80 μl of the same solution. Intracellular Ca2+ was measured using a fluid handling integrated fluorescence plate reader (Flex Station; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). 2APB and other drugs were diluted into ECS at three times the desired final concentrations and delivered to the sample plate by the integrated robotic eight-channel pipettor at the preprogrammed time points. The fluo4 fluorescence was read at excitation of 494 nm and emission of 525 nm from the bottom of the plate at 0.67 Hz. All of the experiments were performed at 32 °C unless indicated otherwise. cRNA Synthesis and Expression in Xenopus Oocytes—TRPV1 and V3 in the pAGA3 vector were linearized using HindIII. cRNAs were synthesized using mMessage mMachine reagents and protocols obtained from Ambion (Austin, TX). The resulting cRNAs were dissolved in diethylpyrocarbonate-treated H2O. Sexually mature female Xenopus laevis of older than 2.5 years of age were purchased from Xenopus I, Inc. (Dexter, MI). The frogs were quarantined for at least 2 weeks before being used. For oocyte isolation, small pieces of ovarian lobe were dissected out from anesthetized frogs and shaken gently at 19 °C for 90 min in a solution containing 82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, and supplemented with 1 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington Biochem, Lakewood, NJ). Denuded, healthy looking oocytes of more than 1 mm in diameter were selected and injected in a volume of 50 nl/cell with a total of 5 ng of cRNA. The injected oocytes were incubated at 19 °C for 2–5 days in sterile Barth's saline (88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 0.33 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 7.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, supplemented with 20 units/ml penicillin and 20 μg/ml streptomycin). The solution was changed daily. Two-electrode Voltage Clamp—The oocytes were placed in a 50-μl chamber that was perfused with a bath solution containing 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The cell was impaled with two intracellular glass electrodes filled with 3 m KCl connected to a TEV-700 two-electrode voltage clamp work station (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). The oocytes were clamped at -40 mV, and the currents were continuously recorded using a chart recorder (Astro Med, Inc., West Warwick, RI) and at the same time digitized at 100 Hz using a PowerLab Data Acquisition System (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). The low pH solutions were made of 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm MES, adjusted to the desired pH with NaOH. 2APB, capsaicin, and other drugs were dissolved in the bath solution at the desired final concentrations and applied to the cells by perfusion. Temperature changes were made using a CL-100 Bipolar temperature controller connected to a SC-20 dual in-line solution heater/cooler (Warner Instruments). Isolation and Culture of Rat DRG Neurons—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–220 g) were anesthetized with 4% halothane in air and decapitated. DRG (T1–T10) were extracted under a dissecting microscope and placed in ice-cold DMEM/Ham's F-12 solution. Each ganglion was desheathed, cut into ∼10 pieces, placed in 0.125% type IV collagenase, and incubated in a humidified chamber for 1 h in 5% CO2 in air at 37 °C. The ganglion suspension was centrifuged (150 × g, 5 min) and supernatant-aspirated. The ganglion pellet was resuspended in 0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution, incubated for 5 min, and centrifuged (150 × g, 5 min). The ganglion pellet was then resuspended in a modified DMEM/Ham's F-12 (DMEM/Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 μm MEM nonessential amino acids) and gently triturated with a small bore fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The dispersed cell suspension was centrifuged (500 × g, 8 min) through a layer of 15% bovine serum albumin to separate the cells from the myelin debris. The pellets were resuspended in the modified DMEM/Ham's F-12 solution supplemented with 50 ng/ml 2.5S nerve growth factor, plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, and then incubated overnight (5% CO2 in air at 37 °C). Whole Cell Perforated Patch Clamp Recording of DRG Neurons—The coverslip containing the attached cells was centered in a small volume (0.2 ml) perfusion chamber that was perfused by gravity feed with 2APB, capsazepine, ruthenium red, or vehicle (extracellular solution) at 2 ml/min, whereas the chemical stimulants (2APB, capsaicin, and acid) were delivered by a pressure-driven perfusion system (ALA-VM8; ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY), with its tip positioned to ensure that the cell was fully within the stream of the perfusate. The extracellular solution consisted of 136 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.33 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The intracellular solution contained 92 mm potassium gluconate, 40 mm KCl, 8 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2. Recordings were made in the whole cell perforated patch configuration (100 μg/ml gramicidin) using Axopatch 200B/pCLAMP9 (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). The experiments were performed at room temperature (20–24 °C). The data were acquired at 5 kHz and filtered at 2 kHz. Series resistance was compensated at ∼80%. The membrane potential was held at -70 mV. The data were collected from only one cell/dish to avoid possible drug contamination of the cells. Differential Effects of 2APB on TRP Channels—In transiently transfected HEK293 cells, the OAG (10 μm)-evoked TRPC6 currents, and the 100 μm menthol-elicited TRPM8 currents were inhibited by 2APB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). When activated, both channels gave rise to outwardly rectifying currents, which reversed near 0 mV. 2APB blocked both the inward and the outward currents with the blockage of the inward current being slightly more effective. The TRPC6 currents were incompletely blocked by 300 μm 2APB to 47.6 ± 6.7% at +100 mV and 35.4 ± 4.3% at -100 mV of the control response (n = 5). The IC50 values were 10.4 ± 2.5 μm at -100 mV (Hill coefficient, nh = 1.0 ± 0.3, n = 5) and 13.9 ± 2.3 μm at +100 mV (nh = 1.1 ± 0.2). The TRPM8 currents were abolished by 300 μm 2APB. The IC50 values were 7.7 ± 2.2 μm (nh = 0.9 ± 0.2, n = 5) and 11.6 ± 1.2 μm (nh = 1.2 ± 0.2) at -100 and + 100 mV, respectively. In contrast to TRPC6 and TRPM8, TRPV1 was dose-dependently activated by 2APB in the absence of any TRPV1 agonists (Fig. 1C). At 0.3–1.0 mm, 2APB evoked a current that was comparable with that elicited by 1 μm capsaicin, both in current amplitudes and the shape of the current-voltage (I/V) curves. The EC50 values of 2APB for TRPV1 activation were 197 ± 13 μm at -100 mV (nh = 1.8 ± 0.1, n = 6) and 130 ± 17 μm at +100 mV (nh = 1.5 ± 0.2). The response to 2APB was also detected in Xenopus oocytes injected with the cRNA for mouse TRPV1 (Fig. 2). Defoliculated Xenopus oocytes were injected with TRPV1 cRNA, and TRPV1 activity was measured 2–4 days later using two-electrode voltage-clamp techniques. The cells were held at -40 mV and placed in a Ca2+-free external solution to minimize the Ca2+-activated Cl- conductance and the inactivation of TRPV1 channels. Bath application of 2APB elicited inward currents only in oocytes injected with the cRNA for TRPV1 but not in uninjected oocytes or oocytes injected with the cRNA for an inactive form of TRPV1 that lacks 10 amino acids at the N terminus (GenBank™ accession number AY452084). The 2APB-evoked currents were abolished by 3 μm ruthenium red (Fig. 2, A and C). However, the competitive capsaicin antagonist, capsazepine, at 30 μm only blocked ∼30% of the response elicited by 2APB, although it almost completely inhibited the response activated by 1 μm capsaicin (Fig. 2). The weak effect of capsazepine on 2APB-induced currents was not unexpected because for the mouse TRPV1, the antagonist was also very weak at inhibiting the currents elicited by acid or heat (data not shown). Similarly poor inhibitions of acid- and heat-induced responses by capsazepine were found for rat but not human TRPV1 channels (37McIntyre P. McLatchie L.M. Chambers A. Phillips E. Clarke M. Savidge J. Toms C. Peacock M. Shah K. Winter J. Weerasakera N. Webb M. Rang H.P. Bevan S. James I.F. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 132: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Together, the above data demonstrate that 2APB is an activator of TRPV1. Potentiation of TRPV1 Responses by 2APB—TRPV1 is a polymodal sensor responsive to multiple stimuli such as, heat, protons, and the principal pungent ingredient of chili peppers, capsaicin (7Caterina M.

When expressed in HEK293 cells, TRPV1 is partially activated by low concentrations of 2APB (100 μm) or capsaicin (0.3 μm). When added together, these drugs caused a large increase in TRPV1 activity (Fig. 3A). The average increase was 9.0 ± 2.0-fold at +100 mV and 32 ± 11-fold at -100 mV (n = 7) as compared with the currents elicited by 2APB alone. Similarly, the response to 2APB was strongly potentiated by weak extracellular acidification to pH 6.5, which by itself had a very small effect on TRPV1. The average increases evoked by 2APB at pH 6.5 were 25.0 ± 6.0- and 21.0 ± 8.0-fold (n = 6) at +100 and -100 mV, respectively, as compared with the current elicited by 2APB at pH 7.4 (Fig. 3B). For the transiently transfected HEK293 cells, the response to the low concentration of 2APB as well as to that of capsaicin or protons was quite variable, presumably because of differences in the levels of channel expression. Noticeably, there was a negative association between the initial response to 2APB and the increase that was elicited by the co-application with the low level of capsaicin or weak acid. Cells that responded weakly to 2APB, which also had weak responses to capsaicin or acid, typically displayed more potentiation than those that responded strongly (Fig. 3C). The effect of 2APB on capsaicin- and acid-induced activation and that of capsaicin and acid on 2APB-evoked activation of TRPV1 were studied in more detail in Xenopus oocytes. As shown in Fig. 4A, 100 μm 2APB strongly potentiated the response induced by 0.1 and 0.3 μm capsaicin. At this 2APB concentration, the dose-response curve for capsaicin was shifted to the left with the EC50 value changed from 1.34 ± 0.12 μm (nh = 2.0 ± 0.3) in the absence of 2APB to 0.35 ± 0.08 μm (nh = 1.2 ± 0.3) in the presence of 2APB. Inversely, 0.3 μm capsaicin caused a left shift of the dose-response curve for 2APB (Fig. 4B) with a decrease in the EC50 value from 315 ± 13 μm (nh = 2.27 ± 0.24) to 34 ± 2 μm (nh = 0.92 ± 0.05). Likewise, the EC50 value for protons to activate TRPV1 changed from pH 5.220 ± 0.001 (nh = 1.37 ± 0.02) in the absence of 2APB to pH 6.036 ± 0.005 (nh = 1.00 ± 0.01) in the presence of 100 μm 2APB (Fig. 4C). The EC50 value of 2APB also decreased from 322.0 ± 0.8 μm (nh = 3.10 ± 0.04) at pH 7.5 to 159.1 ± 5.9 μm (nh = 1.60 ± 0.10) at pH 6.5 (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that 2APB and the other two activators of TRPV1 (capsaicin and acid) sensitized the effects of each other. Interestingly, with the presence of another stimulus, the Hill coefficient of the dose-response curve to a given ligand was typically decreased to half of the original value when it was applied alone, suggesting that sensitization is accompanied with a decrease in cooperativity. In addition to the chemical activators, the response to 2APB was also enhanced by heat. At 40 °C, the TRPV1 current evoked by 100 μm 2APB was about nine times larger than that obtained at 22 °C (Fig. 4E). Therefore, 2APB acts synergistically with other known activating factors of TRPV1 channels.

The basicity of the CPO-II ferryl [p K a &gt; 8.2 (where K a is the acid dissociation constant)] is attributable to strong electron donation by the axial thiolate. We suggest that the CPO-II protonated ferryl is a good model for the rebound intermediate in the P450 oxygenation cycle;with elevated p K a values after one-electron reduction, thiolate-ligated ferryl radicals are competent to oxygenate saturated hydrocarbons at potentials that can be tolerated by folded polypeptide hosts."

Here, we identified a highly dynamic feedback mechanism by which the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can regulate phospholipid biosynthesis. Phosphatidic acid on the endoplasmic reticulum directly bound to the soluble transcriptional repressor Opi1p to maintain it as inactive outside the nucleus. After the addition of the lipid precursor inositol, this phosphatidic acid was rapidly consumed, releasing Opi1p from the endoplasmic reticulum and allowing its nuclear translocation and repression of target genes. Thus, phosphatidic acid appears to be both an essential ubiquitous metabolic intermediate and a signaling lipid."

https://openalex.org/W1971801600,"Anterior-to-posterior patterning, the process whereby our digits are differently shaped, is a key aspect of limb development. It depends on the localized expression in posterior limb bud of Sonic hedgehog ( Shh ) and the morphogenetic potential of its diffusing product. By using an inversion of and a large deficiency in the mouse HoxD cluster, we found that a perturbation in the early collinear expression of Hoxd11, Hoxd12 , and Hoxd13 in limb buds led to a loss of asymmetry. Ectopic Hox gene expression triggered abnormal Shh transcription, which in turn induced symmetrical expression of Hox genes in digits, thereby generating double posterior limbs. We conclude that early posterior restriction of Hox gene products sets up an anterior-posterior prepattern, which determines the localized activation of Shh . This signal is subsequently translated into digit morphological asymmetry by promoting the late expression of Hoxd genes, two collinear processes relying on opposite genomic topographies, upstream and downstream Shh signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2019822857,"Regulation of smooth muscle myosin phosphatase (SMPP-1M) is thought to be a primary mechanism for explaining Ca2+ sensitization/desensitization in smooth muscle. Ca2+ sensitization induced by activation of G protein-coupled receptors acting through RhoA involves phosphorylation of Thr-696 (of the human isoform) of the myosin targeting subunit (MYPT1) of SMPP-1M inhibiting activity. In contrast, agonists that elevate intracellular cGMP and cAMP promote Ca2+ desensitization in smooth muscle through apparent activation of SMPP-1M. We show that cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG)/cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) efficiently phosphorylates MYPT1 in vitro at Ser-692, Ser-695, and Ser-852 (numbering for human isoform). Although phosphorylation of MYPT1 by PKA/PKG has no direct effect on SMPP-1M activity, a primary site of phosphorylation is Ser-695, which is immediately adjacent to the inactivating Thr-696. In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-695 by PKA/PKG appeared to prevent phosphorylation of Thr-696 by MYPT1K. In ileum smooth muscle, Ser-695 showed a 3-fold increase in phosphorylation in response to 8-bromo-cGMP. Addition of constitutively active recombinant MYPT1K to permeabilized smooth muscles caused phosphorylation of Thr-696 and Ca2+ sensitization; however, this phosphorylation was blocked by preincubation with 8-bromo-cGMP. These findings suggest a mechanism of Ca2+ desensitization in smooth muscle that involves mutual exclusion of phosphorylation, whereby phosphorylation of Ser-695 prevents phosphorylation of Thr-696 and therefore inhibition of SMPP-1M.

These findings suggest a mechanism of Ca2+ desensitization in smooth muscle that involves mutual exclusion of phosphorylation, whereby phosphorylation of Ser-695 prevents phosphorylation of Thr-696 and therefore inhibition of SMPP-1M. Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle are primarily determined by the level of phosphorylation of the myosin light chain (MLC-20). 1The abbreviations used are: MLC, myosin light chain; MLCK, MLC kinase; PKG, cGMP-dependent protein kinase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; ROCK, Rho kinase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CRP, cleaved radioactive peptide; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate). To initiate contraction, an action potential or binding of a contractile agonist causes an increase in intracellular Ca2+, which activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzyme. MLCK phosphorylates MLC-20 on serine 19, resulting in contraction of smooth muscle through increases in myosin ATPase activity and cross-bridge cycling (1Horowitz A. Menice C.B. Laporte R.

Relaxation of smooth muscle is achieved by either removal of the contractile agonist (passive relaxation) or through agonists that activate guanylyl or adenylyl cyclase and stimulate the production of cyclic nucleotides, cGMP or cAMP, thus activating their targets, cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (2Woodrum D.A.

In vitro the MYPT1 phosphorylation data suggest that multiple serine residues are phosphorylated by PKA/PKG; specifically Ser-849 (M133 isoform) was suggested because it is in a PKG phosphorylation consensus sequence, and the C-terminal portion of the protein was found to be phosphorylated (15Nakamura M.

In smooth muscle, the presence of the leucine zipper domain of both PKG and MYPT1 has been shown to be essential for the protein kinase to mediate relaxation as determined by MLC-20 phosphorylation, although the binding of PKG-1 to MYPT1 does not absolutely require the leucine zipper domain (16Surks H.K.

Activation of SMPP-1M was suspected, but activity was measured indirectly by assessing MLC dephosphorylation. The study suggested that phosphorylation by PKA/PKG may inhibit Thr-696 phosphorylation and thus a decrease in the level of inhibition of SMPP-1M rather than an activation. To investigate the mechanisms by which PKA/PKG might bring about Ca2+ desensitization through direct interactions with SMPP-1M, we first identified all the major sites phosphorylated by these kinases on MYPT1 in vitro. We identified three serine residues on MYPT1 that are phosphorylated by PKA/PKG (Ser-692, Ser-695, and Ser-852, human isoform numbering), and we showed specifically that phosphorylation of Ser-695 precludes phosphorylation at the inactivating site Thr-696 by MYPT1K and ROCK in vitro. The reverse situation also occurred. Treatment of permeabilized ileal smooth muscles with 8-bromo-cGMP induced phosphorylation of Ser-695 and greatly attenuated the Ca2+-sensitizing effects of exogenous MYPT1K. These findings suggest that one way cyclic nucleotides mediate their Ca2+-desensitizing effects in smooth muscle is by blocking the inhibitory phosphorylation mechanism for SMPP-1M.

Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The cDNA clone was inserted in-frame into pGEX-6-P-1 in the NotI/BamHI sites (Amersham Biosciences). Escherichia coli cells were grown in LB broth in 50 μg/ml ampicillin overnight at 37 °C. Cells were incubated in 300 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 2 h to induce protein expression, and GST-MYPT1K was isolated by using glutathione-Sepharose. The GST moiety was cleaved by an overnight digestion with Precission Protease® according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). A hexahistidine-tagged C-terminal fragment of MYPT1 (sequence 514–963 of the M130 chicken isoform; termed C130), full-length chicken GST-MYPT1 (M133), and rat GST-MYPT1 (M110) were expressed and purified as described (6Feng J.

Muscle Tension Measurement—For in situ contractile experiments, adult male New Zealand White rabbits were anesthetized with halothane and exsanguinated according to approved animal protocols. Ileum smooth muscle was removed, and strips of muscle (5 mm × 200 μm) were cut and the ends tied with silk suture. The muscle strips were then mounted in 140-μl “bubble chambers.” One end of each strip was attached to a force transducer (SensorOne AE801, Sausalito, CA), and tension was set to 1.3 times resting length. The strips were permeabilized with β-escin (50 μm) for 30 min at room temperature in Ca2+-free solution containing 1 mm EGTA (G1). Muscles were treated with the Ca2+ ionophore A23187 (10 μm) for 10 min to deplete intracellular Ca2+ stores. After extensive washing in G1, muscles were stimulated with 10 mm Ca2+ solution (CaG) for 5 min and then washed extensively and placed in G1. Either vehicle (water) or 8-bromo-cGMP (100 μm) was administered for 5 min, followed by rMYPT1K (10 μm) for 10 min. The strips were washed extensively again and then contracted in CaG. Force and rate of contraction were measured as a percent of the maximum contraction in CaG. Western Blot Analysis of Smooth Muscle Tissue—Rabbit ileum was collected as described above, and squares (5 × 5 mm) were mounted in a silicone bottom dish. The muscles were permeabilized and washed as described above. To test the phosphorylation of Ser-695, the ileum was treated with vehicle (water) or 8-bromo-cGMP (100 μm) for 10 min and then flash-frozen in liquid N2-cooled Freon. To test the level of Thr-696 phosphorylation after pretreatment with 8-bromo-cGMP, muscles were treated with vehicle or 8-bromo-cGMP (100 μm) for 5 min, followed by 10 μm rMYPT1K for 10 min, and then flash-frozen in liquid N2-cooled Freon. The frozen squares were stored in 10% trichloroacetic acid in acetone, thawed, washed in acetone, and then homogenized in buffer containing 600 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, and 1 μm microcystin-LR. Homogenates were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20. Blots were incubated overnight with primary antibody directed against phospho-Ser-695 of MYPT1 (1:1,000) or with primary polyclonal antibody directed against nonphosphorylated MYPT1 (1:2000). The blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody (1:2000) for 1 h and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Bands were quantitated by densitometry, and the relative phosphorylation was determined as a function of the density of total MYPT1. Equal protein loading was determined by Amido Black staining of the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after blotting. In Vitro Phosphorylation, Kinase, and Phosphatase Assays—All phosphorylation reactions for site analysis were carried out by using 100 μg of MYPT1 (c130), 5 μg of PKAc or PKG, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (2,500 cpm/nmol). For stoichiometry reactions, 2 μm GST-MYPT1 (or C130) was phosphorylated by PKA (1 μg/ml), ROCK (0.4 units/ml), or rMYPT1K (44 μg/ml) in the presence of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (2500 cpm/nmol). For phosphatase assays, GST-MYPT1 (M110) was mixed with an equimolar amount of native rabbit PP1C. Smooth muscle myosin phosphatase assays were performed by using 32P-labeled myosin as described previously (19Shirazi A. Iizuka K. Fadden P. Mosse C. Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31598-31606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase assays with the substrate peptide were carried out at 25 °Cin50-μl reactions with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP (2500 cpm/nmol), 100 μm MYPT1 Ser-691 to Ala substrate peptide, and 0.3 μm rMYPT1K. Reactions were terminated by spotting on P81 paper after a time course. P81 papers were washed three times in 20 mm H3PO4, placed in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes, and Cerenkov counted. Kinase assays for sequential phosphorylation of MYPT1 by PKA, ROCK, or rMYPT1K were carried out as described previously (9Muranyi A. MacDonald J.A. Deng J.T. Wilson D.P. Haystead T.A. Walsh M.P. Erdodi F. Kiss E. Wu Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 211-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by using GST-MYPT1 (2 μm), PKA (1 μg/ml), or ROCK (0.4 units/ml) or rMYPT1K (44 μg/ml). Phosphorylation was initiated with one kinase, and then part of the reaction mixture was removed and continued with a second kinase. Incorporation of 32P was estimated by Cerenkov counting as above. GST-MYPT1 (2 μm) was thiophosphorylated by PKA (1 μg/ml) for 150 min with 0.5 mm ATPγS (other conditions as in Ref. 9Muranyi A. MacDonald J.A. Deng J.T. Wilson D.P. Haystead T.A. Walsh M.P. Erdodi F. Kiss E. Wu Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 211-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 85 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, and 4 mm dithiothreitol. The thiophosphorylated GST-MYPT1 was then subjected to phosphorylation with ROCK (0.4 units/ml) in 0.2 mm [γ-32P]ATP. A non-thiophosphorylated GST-MYPT1 was phosphorylated by ROCK, as a control. Aliquots of each reaction were removed at intervals to measure phosphate incorporation and also for use in Western blots with the MYPT1pT696 antibody. At the end of the reaction period, the two samples were assayed for inhibition of native PP1c (0.5 nm) by using 32P-MLC-20 (5 μm) as substrate (9Muranyi A. MacDonald J.A. Deng J.T. Wilson D.P. Haystead T.A. Walsh M.P. Erdodi F. Kiss E. Wu Y. Hartshorne D.J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 211-216Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation Site Analysis—Phosphorylated MYPT1 was digested either with endoprotease Lys-C (6 μg/mg) or V8 endoprotease E (V8 protease) (6 μg/mg) overnight, and phosphopeptides were separated by reverse phase HPLC. Radioactive peptides were collected and cross-linked to Immobilon P filters (Applied Biosystems) as described (22MacDonald J.A. Mackey A.J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 314-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The filters were placed in an ABI 474cLC Edman sequenator configured to collect the phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives immediately following cleavage of the N-terminal amino acid with trifluoroacetic acid. The amount of radioactivity released after each Edman cycle was determined by Cerenkov counting. The cleaved radioactive peptide (CRP) algorithm (fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/crp/) using lysine as the cleavage point was used to identify all possible serine/threonine residues in the MYPT1K sequence that corresponded to release of radioactivity during Edman sequencing. To precisely identify each site, the experiment was repeated following digestion with V8 protease. CRP analysis was repeated using glutamic acid as the cleavage site. Cross-referencing release of radioactivity after cleavage at lysine with glutamic acid unambiguously identified three PKA/PKG phosphorylation sites on MYPT1. Statistical Analysis—All results are reported as mean ± S.E. A Student's unpaired t test was used to determine the statistical significance of Ser-695 and Thr-696 phosphorylation in smooth muscles and of changes in smooth muscle contraction. p < 0.05 was considered significant. Treatment of Smooth Muscle Strips with 8-Bromo-cGMP Attenuates the Ca2+-sensitizing Effect of MYPT1K—Treatment of isolated smooth muscles with 8-bromo-cGMP is known to bring about relaxation in a Ca2+-independent manner (13Wu X. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The primary target for cGMP is PKG, yet the mechanisms by which the protein kinase brings about Ca2+ desensitization are unclear. We sought to determine whether phosphorylation of MYPT1 by PKG reduced the level of Ca2+ sensitization induced by MYPT1K. Addition of constitutively active rMYPT1K to permeabilized smooth muscle is known to phosphorylate MYPT1 (at Thr-696), inhibit endogenous SMPP-1M activity, and produce a marked Ca2+ sensitization (5Borman M.A. MacDonald J.A. Muranyi A. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23441-23446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 8MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The effect of pretreatment with 8-bromo-cGMP on contraction elicited by rMYPT1K was analyzed. Treatment of permeabilized muscle with rMYPT1K elicited a contraction that was 41.8 ± 0.9% of the maximum Ca2+ (CaG) contraction (Fig. 1, A and C). Pre-treatment with 100 μm 8-bromo-cGMP before rMYPT1K administration significantly reduced the contraction to 19 ± 6.54% (n = 5, p < 0.04) of the maximum Ca2+ contraction (Fig. 1, B and C). The findings suggest a possible mechanism of Ca2+ desensitization, whereby phosphorylation of SMPP-1M or other proteins attenuates the Ca2+-sensitizing actions of MYPT1K in smooth muscle. Characterization of the Site Phosphorylated on rMYPT1 by PKA/PKG in Vitro—To investigate the hypothesis that PKG/PKA may bring about their Ca2+-desensitizing effects through phosphorylation of MYPT1, we identified the phosphorylation sites by using a recombinant fragment of MYPT1 (C130). Fig. 2A (inset) shows that PKG efficiently phosphorylated C130 to ∼3.5 mol of phosphate/mol of C130. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that the fully phosphorylated protein contained phosphoserine. Some phosphothreonine was seen if the in vitro phosphorylation reaction was carried out to 2.5 h. To identify the phosphorylation sites, C130 was phosphorylated with PKA or PKG in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP, and the phosphorylated protein was digested with endolysine protease C. The digest was separated by reverse phase HPLC, and phosphopeptides were identified in column fractions by Cerenkov counting (Fig. 2A). Three peaks of radioactivity were identified and cross-linked to Immobilon P filters (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) as described (22MacDonald J.A. Mackey A.J. Pearson W.R. Haystead T.A. Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2002; 1: 314-322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The Immobilon filters were placed in an automated Edman sequenator, and after each Edman cycle, the amount of radioactivity released from each cross-linked peptide was determined by Cerenkov counting (Fig. 2, B–D). Peak 1 yielded radioactivity at cycle 3; peak 2 at cycles 4, 9, and 12; and peak 3 at cycles 4 and 12. To confirm the identity of the sites, this cycle of analysis was repeated on phosphopeptides recovered from reverse phase HPLC separation after digestion of PKA/PKG-phosphorylated C130 with V8 endoprotease E (Fig. 2E). These three peptides were subjected to Edman cycling (Fig. 2 F–H). CRP analysis was then carried out using cleavage at glutamic acid as the reference point. Cross-referencing CRP analysis at lysine with glutamic acid unambiguously identified Ser-692, Ser-695, and Ser-852 (of the human isoform, corresponding to Ser-650, Ser-653, and Ser-808 on the chicken M130 protein) as sites phosphorylated by PKA/PKG on rMYPT1. Peak I (endoprotease Lys-C) was the peptide containing the Ser-852 site, and peak II (endoprotease Lys-C) contained Ser-692 and Ser-695. Analysis of a time course of phosphorylation of peptide II showed that the phosphorylation of Ser-692 and Ser-695 was not ordered, i.e. one site does not need to be phosphorylated before the other one can be. Some phosphorylation of threonine in peak 2 (endolysine protease C) and peak 3 (V8 E) was noted at later time points. PKA/PKG Phosphorylation of MYPT1 Does Not Affect SMPP-1M Activity in Vitro—The effect of phosphorylation of MYPT1 by PKA/PKG on SMPP-1M activity was determined. Purified full-length rMYPT1 (M110) that had been incubated with the phosphatase catalytic subunit PP-1C was phosphorylated by PKG. As a control, parallel reactions using rMYPT1K were performed. Phosphatase assays were carried out with 32P-labeled smooth muscle myosin as the substrate. Phosphorylation of recombinant SMPP-1M by PKG does not affect phosphatase activity (Fig. 3A). In contrast, phosphorylation of the enzyme by rMYPT1K dramatically inhibits activity, which corroborates previous work (8MacDonald J.A. Borman M.A. Muranyi A. Somlyo A.V. Hartshorne D.J. Haystead T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2419-2424Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) showing that MYPT1K preferentially phosphorylates Thr-696, inhibiting SMPP-1M activity. The Phosphorylation Sites for PKA, ROCK, and rMYPT1K Are Mutually Dependent—Because the in situ data suggested that pre-phosphorylation of MYPT1 by PKA was affecting calcium sensitization, we investigated the effect of pre-phosphorylation of GST-MYPT1 (M133 isoform) by PKA on the ability of known SMPP-1M inhibitory kinases, ROCK and MYPT1K, to phosphorylate rMYPT1. Pre-phosphorylation of GST-MYPT1 (M133) by PKA to 2 mol of phosphate/mol of GST-MYPT1 caused a dramatic decrease in the subsequent phosphorylation of MYPT1 by ROCK and 0.26 mol/mol in contrast to 1.60 mol/mol phosphorylation of MYPT1 by ROCK without PKA pre-phosphorylation (Fig. 3, B and C). The reverse reaction also occurs in which pre-phosphorylation of MYPT1 by ROCK decreased further phosphorylation by PKA (Fig. 3C). Note that the extent of phosphorylation by PKA in the sample pre-phosphorylated by ROCK is about 0.95 mol of phosphate/mol (over a 150-min incubation) compared with about 2.2 mol of phosphate/mol (over a similar time period) with PKA alone (Fig. 3B). Similar experiments were carried out with PKA and rMYPT1K. Pre-phosphorylation of GST-MYPT1K by PKA reduced subsequent phosphorylation by rMYPT1K to about 0.4 mol phosphate/mol (Fig. 3D). By using the opposite sequence, pre-phosphorylation by rMYPT1K (to about 1.7 mol of phosphate/mol) attenuated phosphorylation by PKA (increase of only 0.25 mol of phosphate/mol) and essentially blocked phosphorylation by ROCK (Fig. 3E). These data suggest that the adjacent phosphorylation sites on MYPT1 for PKA, ROCK, and rMYPT1K are dependent on phosphorylation of the partner site. Although the emphasis in this article is on the pair of sites containing the inhibitory site (i.e. Ser-695 and Thr-696), it is evident that the adjacent sites containing the second major ROCK site (i.e. Ser-852 and Thr-853) may be subject to the same mutual dependence. Another approach to assess the influence of the adjacent Ser-695 and Thr-696 sites was to use the synthetic substrate peptide (residues 689–700). Because Ser-691 (avian numbering) was identified as a PKA/PKG site, the Ser-691 to Ala mutant was used (see “Experimental Procedures”) to simplify analysis. Both PKA and MYPT1K readily phosphorylated the peptide to 1 mol/mol. Phosphorylation site analysis using radioactivity release during Edman sequence analysis confirmed that PKA phosphorylated Ser-695, whereas rMYPT1K phosphorylated Thr-696. To test the ability of Ser-695 phosphorylation to interfere with phosphorylation of Thr-696, the peptide was pre-phosphorylated in the presence and absence of PKA by using nonradioactive ATP. After 30 min, rMYPT1K was added with [γ-32P]ATP, and the reaction wa"

Here we present a high-resolution record of the sulfur isotopic composition of seawater sulfate for the Cretaceous. The general enrichment of isotopically light sulfur that prevailed during the Cretaceous may have been due to increased volcanic and hydrothermal activity. Two excursions toward isotopically lighter sulfur represent periods of lower rates of pyrite burial, implying a shift in the location of organic carbon burial to terrestrial or open-ocean settings. The concurrent changes in seawater sulfur and inorganic carbon isotopic compositions imply short-term variability in atmospheric oxygen partial pressure."

https://openalex.org/W2061544228,"In mouse, two different isoforms of ADAM1 (fertilin α), ADAM1a and ADAM1b, are produced in the testis. ADAM1a is localized within the endoplasmic reticulum of testicular germ cells, whereas epididymal sperm contain only ADAM1b on the plasma membrane. In this study, we show that the loss of ADAM1a results in the male infertility because of the severely impaired ability of sperm to migrate from the uterus into the oviduct through the uterotubal junction. However, epididymal sperm of ADAM1a-deficient mice were capable of fertilizing cumulus-intact, zona pellucida-intact eggs in vitro despite the delayed dispersal of cumulus cells and the reduced adhesion/binding to the zona pellucida. Among testis (sperm)-specific proteins examined, only the level of ADAM3 (cyritestin) was strongly reduced in ADAM1a-deficient mouse sperm. Moreover, the appearance of ADAM3 on the sperm surface was dependent on the formation of a fertilin protein complex between ADAM1a and ADAM2 (fertilin β) in testicular germ cells, although no direct interaction between the fertilin complex and ADAM3 was found. These results suggest that ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin may be implicated in the selective transport of specific sperm proteins including ADAM3 from the endoplasmic reticulum of testicular germ cells onto the cell surface. These proteins then can participate in sperm migration into the oviduct, the dispersal of cumulus cells, and sperm binding to the zona pellucida.

A family of ADAM (adisintegrin and metalloprotease) transmembranous proteins belonging to the zinc protease superfamily is implicated in various biological processes such as fertilization, neurogenesis, myogenesis, cancer, and inflammation (1Schlöndorff J.

ADAMs have a unique organization containing an N-terminal signal peptide domain followed by pro-, metalloprotease, disintegrin, cysteine-rich, epidermal growth factor-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic tail domains, each of which has been believed to fulfill distinct function(s).

Baba T. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 291: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ADAM1a is present within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of TGC, whereas epididymal sperm contain only ADAM1b on the cell surface (21Kim E. Nishimura H. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Moreover, although either ADAM is capable of forming the fertilin protein complex with ADAM2 in the ER of TGC, only the ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin complex is present on the sperm surface (21Kim E. Nishimura H. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data imply that ADAM1a and ADAM1b have critical, distinct roles in spermatogenesis and fertilization, respectively. To elucidate the role(s) of ADAM1a in TGC, we produced male mice carrying a disruptive mutation in ADAM1a by homologous recombination. The ADAM1a-deficient male mice are infertile because sperm have a severely impaired ability to migrate from the uterus into the oviduct through the uterotubal junction (UTJ). ADAM3, but not other testis (sperm)-specific proteins, is strongly reduced on ADAM1a-deficient mouse sperm. Comparative experiments using TGC and epididymal sperm of ADAM1a-, ADAM2-, and ADAM3-deficient mice suggest that the ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin complex may be implicated in the transport of sperm proteins, including ADAM3, from the ER of TGC onto the cell surface. Generation of Mutant Mice Lacking ADAM1a—A mouse genomic clone, mFAG10 (20Nishimura H. Kim E. Fujimori T. Kashiwabara S. Kuroiwa A. Matsuda Y. Baba T. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 291: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), encoding ADAM1a was used for construction of a targeting vector containing an expression cassette of the neomycin-resistance gene (neo) flanked by a 1.5-kbp genomic region of ADAM1a (see Fig. 1A). The MC1 promoter-driven herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (tk) was also included in the targeting vector for negative selection. Following electroporation of the targeting vector, which had been linearized by digestion with KpnI, into mouse D3 embryonic stem cells, homologous recombinants were selected by using G418 and gancyclovir, as described previously (22Kashiwabara S. Noguchi J. Zhuang T. Ohmura K. Honda A. Sugiura S. Miyamoto K. Takahashi S. Inoue K. Ogura A. Baba T. Science. 2002; 298: 1999-2002Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Seven embryonic stem cell clones carrying the targeted mutation were identified from 450 clones resistant to G418 and gancyclovir and then injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts. Chimeric male mice were crossed to ICR female mice (Japan SLC Inc., Shizuoka, Japan) to establish heterozygous mutant lines. Homozygous mice were obtained by mating of heterozygous males and females. All animal experiments were carried out according to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals in the University of Tsukuba. Blot Hybridization—Genomic DNA was prepared from the mouse tail, digested by EcoRI, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences), as described previously (23Honda A.

Biol. 2000; 228: 106-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The RNA samples were glyoxylated, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, and transferred onto the nylon membranes. The blots were probed by 32P-labeled DNA fragments and analyzed by a BAS2000 Bio-Image Analyzer (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan) (24Kashiwabara S. Zhuang T. Yamagata K. Noguchi J. Fukamizu A. Baba T.

Cells were suspended in a lysis buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), kept on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant solution was subjected to PAGE in the presence of SDS and then Western blot analysis, as described below. Protein concentration was determined using a Coomassie protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Antibodies—Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against ADAM1a, ADAM1b, sp32, and PH-20 were prepared as described previously (21Kim E. Nishimura H. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min in the presence of 1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). After blocking with 1% skim milk, the blots were incubated with primary antibodies for 2 h and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by an ECL Western blotting detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). When complex formation between two ADAMs was examined, protein samples were kept in 0.3% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, separated by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes. To enhance the immunoreactivity, proteins on the membranes were denatured for 30 min at 50 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS and 0.75% 2-mercaptoethanol after transfer. After rinsing thoroughly with water to remove SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol, immunoreactive proteins were detected as described above. Assays of Sperm Migration into the Oviduct—Migration of sperm from the uterus into oviduct was examined as described previously (11Ikawa M. Nakanishi T. Yamada S. Wada I. Kominami K. Tanaka H. Nozaki M. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Briefly, female B6C3F1 mice were superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin (Teikoku Zoki Co., Tokyo, Japan) followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (Teikoku Zoki Co.) 48 h later. The female mice were caged with male mice 12 h after the human chorionic gonadotropin injection, and the formation of vaginal plug was observed every 30 min. The oviducts were excised with a connective part of the uterus ∼2 h after the copulation, fixed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 4% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and frozen in OCT compound (Sakura Fine-technical Co., Tokyo, Japan). Sections were prepared, stained with hematoxylin, and then observed under an Olympus BX50 microscope. Assays of the Dispersal of Cumulus Cells by Sperm—Eggs, tightly packed with cumulus cells, were collected from the oviductal ampulla of superovulated ICR mice 15–16 h after human chorionic gonadotropin injection and placed in a 0.2-ml drop of a modified Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution containing glucose, sodium pyruvate, bovine serum albumin, and antibiotics (TYH medium) (32Toyoda Y. Yokoyama M. Hoshi T. Jpn. J. Anim. Reprod. 1971; 16: 147-151Crossref Google Scholar) covered with mineral oil. Fresh cauda epididymal sperm from 3-month-old mice were capacitated by incubation for 2 h in a 0.2-ml drop of TYH medium at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. An aliquot of the capacitated sperm suspension (1.5 × 105 sperm/ml) was mixed with the eggs in TYH medium. The eggs and sperm were incubated for 1–6 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. The status of the cumulus mass was microscopically assessed at time intervals according to the criterion described previously (27Baba D. Kashiwabara S. Honda A. Yamagata K. Wu Q. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30310-30314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Assays of Sperm-ZP Binding—Superovulated eggs were treated with bovine testicular hyaluronidase (3 units/ml, Sigma) for 15 min to remove cumulus cells, washed, and placed in a 0.2-ml drop of TYH medium covered with mineral oil. An aliquot of capacitated sperm suspension (1.5 × 105 sperm/ml) was added to the drop, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. The number of sperm bound to the egg ZP was counted using an Olympus BX50 microscope equipped with HC-2500 digital camera (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo, Japan) (26Yamagata K. Murayama K. Okabe M.

Assays of in Vitro Fertilization—Cumulus-intact, ZP-intact eggs were inseminated by capacitated sperm (1.5 × 105 sperm/ml) in a 0.2-ml drop of TYH medium. After incubation for 6 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air, the eggs were treated with bovine hyaluronidase (3 units/ml) for 15 min to remove cumulus cells and then washed. The female and male pronuclei in the eggs were stained with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (10 μg/ml) for 30 min and then viewed under an Olympus BX50 fluoromicroscope, as described (14Cho C.

Assays of Sperm-Egg Fusion—ZP-intact eggs were incubated with α-chymotrypsin (100 μg/ml, Sigma) for 3–5 min and then washed. The ZP-free eggs were treated with 4′-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and then inseminated with capacitated sperm (1.5 × 105 sperm/ml). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air, the eggs were observed under the above fluoromicroscope, as described (14Cho C. Bunch D.O. Faure J.-E. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Primakoff P.

Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation—Proteins (1 mg) were extracted from TGC in a lysis buffer (0.5 ml) consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, and 10% protease inhibitor mixture, as described above, precleared by incubation with 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% slurry, Amersham Biosciences) on ice for 3 h, and centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant solution was mixed with fresh Protein A-Sepharose beads (30 μl), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 3 h with antibodies. After centrifugation, the pellet was washed five times with the lysis buffer, suspended in a Laemmli buffer containing 1% SDS and 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, boiled for 5 min, and then analyzed by Western blotting. Anti-sp32 antibody and rabbit preimmune serum were used as controls. To investigate the role of ER-resident ADAM1a in spermatogenesis, we produced mutant mice lacking ADAM1a by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells. The targeting construct was designed to replace the protein-coding region containing the pro-, metalloprotease, disintegrin, and cysteine-rich domains in ADAM1a with neo (Fig. 1A). The genotypes of wild-type (Adam1a+/+), heterozygous (Adam1a+/-), and homozygous (Adam1a-/-) mice for null mutation of ADAM1a were identified by Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). Northern blot analysis indicated the absence of ADAM1a mRNA in Adam1a-/- testis (Fig. 1C). Moreover, protein extracts of Adam1a-/- TGC completely lacked the precursor form of ADAM1a (Fig. 1D). These data demonstrate the loss of ADAM1a in Adam1a-/- male mice. Breeding of Adam1a+/- male and female mice yielded the expected Mendelian frequency of Adam1a-/- mice (Adam1a+/+: Adam1a+/-: Adam1a-/- = 67 (20%): 184 (55%): 87 (26%)). Adam1a-/- mice were normal in health condition, body size, and behavior. Despite normal formation of copulation plugs in mated females, the fertility of Adam1a-/- males was severely impaired; only a single pregnancy was observed, and only two offspring were born after 24 Adam1a-/- males were mated with 61 Adam1a+/+ females for more than two months. Therefore, the Adam1a-/- male mice are essentially sterile. Adam1a+/- male and Adam1a-/- female mice exhibited normal fertility, and the average litter sizes were also normal (13.0 ± 1.5 and 10.4 ± 1.5 offspring, n = 8 and 11, respectively). No significant difference in size and weight of the testis was found between Adam1a+/+ and Adam1a-/- mice despite the TGC-specific localization of ADAM1a. Spermatogenic cells in the seminiferous tubules of Adam1a-/- mice were morphologically normal. Cauda epididymal sperm of Adam1a-/- mice could not be distinguished from those of Adam1a+/+ mice by shape, motility, or percentage of spontaneous acrosome reaction (data not shown). In addition, the numbers of sperm in the cauda epididymis (1.4 ± 0.4 × 107 sperm, n = 4) and uterus after ejaculation (1.1 ± 0.3 × 106 sperm, n = 4) in Adam1a-/- mice were similar to those (1.2 ± 0.3 × 107 and 1.2 ± 0.3 × 106 sperm, respectively) in Adam1a+/+ mice. Thus, there is no apparent abnormality in spermatogenesis, sperm maturation, and ejaculation in the Adam1a-/- male mice. We next examined the migration of ejaculated sperm from the uterus into the oviduct through UTJ. As shown in Fig. 2, microscopic analysis of frozen sections of the UTJ 2 h after copulation showed the presence of Adam1a+/+ sperm in the uterus and colliculus tubarius, a small segment of the oviduct that protrudes into the uterine lumen (33Suarez S. Biol. Reprod. 1987; 36: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). However, Adam1a-/- sperm were not detectable in the colliculus, and all of them remained in the uterus. The phenotype of Adam1a-/- sperm is consistent with those of sperm lacking calmegin (10Ikawa M. Wada I. Kominami K. Watanabe D. Toshimori K. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Nature. 1997; 387: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 11Ikawa M. Nakanishi T. Yamada S. Wada I. Kominami K. Tanaka H. Nozaki M. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), tACE (12Hagaman J.R. Moyer J.S. Bachman E.S. Sibony M. Magyar P.L. Welch J.E. Smithies O. Krege J.H. O'Brien D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2552-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar), and ADAM2 (14Cho C. Bunch D.O. Faure J.-E. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Science. 1998; 281: 1857-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of the ER-resident ADAM1a is associated with the ability of sperm to ascend into the oviduct through the UTJ. To assess whether the absence of ADAM1a in the ER of TGC affects sperm/egg interaction, in vitro fertilization assays were carried out using capacitated cauda epididymal sperm. Adam1a-/- sperm showed a significant delay in the dispersal of cumulus cells from the cumulus mass surrounding the eggs (Fig. 3A). The delayed dispersal of cumulus cells may reflect the impaired ability of Adam1a-/- sperm to hydrolyze hyaluronic acid in the extracellular matrix of cumulus cells. However, sperm hyaluronidase PH-20 (27Baba D. Kashiwabara S. Honda A. Yamagata K. Wu Q. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Baba T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30310-30314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 34Primakoff P. Hyatt H. Myles D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2239-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) was normally present on the sperm surface of Adam1a-/- mice, as described below. When cumulus-free, ZP-intact eggs were used, sperm binding to the ZP was severely reduced by the loss of ADAM1a (Fig. 3B). Unexpectedly, Adam1a-/- sperm were capable of fertilizing cumulus-intact, ZP-intact eggs normally (Fig. 3C) despite the delayed dispersal of cumulus cells (Fig. 3A) and the impaired ability to bind the ZP (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, no significant difference in the fusion of sperm with ZP-free eggs was found between Adam1a+/+ and Adam1a-/- mice (Fig. 3D). Therefore, we conclude that the infertility of Adam1a-/- male mice is caused by the inability of sperm to ascend into the oviduct. ADAM1 and ADAM2 are both synthesized as precursors in TGC and converted into the mature forms during the transit of testicular sperm into the epididymis and/or once in the epididymis (21Kim E. Nishimura H. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 25Phelps B.M. Koppel D.E. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1839-1847Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35Blobel C.P. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The deficiency of ADAM2 has been reported to result in the reduction and loss of ADAM1 in TGC and epididymal sperm, respectively (14Cho C. Bunch D.O. Faure J.-E. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Science. 1998; 281: 1857-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 16Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), thus implying the importance of forming the fertilin protein complex between these two ADAMs during spermatogenesis. Calmegin, a homologue of the molecular chaperone calnexin, is present on the ER membrane of TGC and is required for the heterodimerization between ADAM1 and ADAM2 (11Ikawa M. Nakanishi T. Yamada S. Wada I. Kominami K. Tanaka H. Nozaki M. Nishimune Y. Okabe M. Dev. Biol. 2001; 240: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Because two forms of ADAM1, ADAM1a and ADAM1b, exist in mouse TGC (20Nishimura H. Kim E. Fujimori T. Kashiwabara S. Kuroiwa A. Matsuda Y. Baba T. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 291: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 21Kim E. Nishimura H. Baba T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 304: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we examined whether the loss of ADAM1a influences the formation of the fertilin protein complexes in TGC and the appearance of proteins required for fertilization on the sperm membrane. Western blot analysis indicated that six testis (sperm)-specific proteins, including ADAM3, PH-20, tACE, and calmegin, are normally present in TGC of Adam1a-/- mice, although only ADAM3 was severely reduced in Adam1a-/- sperm (Fig. 4A). The levels of ADAM1b, ADAM2, PH-20, and tACE were similar when Adam1a+/+, Adam1a+/-, and Adam1a-/- sperm were compared. When the formation of heterodimeric protein complexes between the precursors of ADAM1a or ADAM1b and ADAM2 in TGC was examined, 200-kDa ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin was the only complex missing in Adam1a-/- mice (Fig. 4B). In some experiments, we found that a 110-kDa precursor form of ADAM3 is synthesized in postmeiotic TGC, processed into the 42-kDa mature protein, probably via a 50-kDa intermediate form during sperm maturation in the epididymis, and localized on the surface of cauda epididymal sperm (data not shown). Because the ADAM3 precursor is normally produced in Adam1a-/- TGC (Fig. 4A), the reduced level of mature ADAM3 in Adam1a-/- sperm is presumably due to the insufficient transport of the ADAM3 precursor from the ER to the cell surface during spermatogenesis. Thus, the formation of the fertilin complex between ADAM1a and ADAM2 in TGC may be involved in the appearance of mature ADAM3 on the sperm surface. Moreover, our results support the possibility that ADAM3 is one of the key molecules directly involved in the binding of sperm to the egg ZP since ADAM1a-, ADAM2-, and ADAM3-deficient mouse sperm, which all show a defect in binding to the ZP, also all have in common that they lack ADAM3 (14Cho C. Bunch D.O. Faure J.-E. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. Science. 1998; 281: 1857-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 15Shamsadin R. Adham I.M. Nayernia K. Heinlein U.A.O. Oberwinkler H. Engel W. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 1445-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 16Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). To further explore the functional roles of fertilin complexes in TGC, protein extracts from TGC and epididymal sperm of mice lacking ADAM2 (Adam2-/-) or ADAM3 (Adam3-/-) were analyzed by Western blotting. When compared with wild-type mice, the level of ADAM1b was reduced in TGC of Adam2-/- mice despite the presence of ADAM1a, ADAM3, and PH-20 (Fig. 4C). Neither fertilin complex between ADAM1a and ADAM2 nor between ADAM 1b and ADAM2 was found in Adam2-/- TGC due to the loss of ADAM2 (Fig. 4D). Also, Adam2-/- sperm completely lacked ADAM1b and barely contained ADAM3 (Fig. 4C), as described previously (16Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In TGC and epididymal sperm of Adam3-/- mice, only ADAM3 was missing, whereas the levels of three other proteins were similar between wild-type and Adam3-/- mice (Fig. 4C). The ADAM1a/ADAM2 and ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin complexes were formed in Adam3-/- TGC (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that the appearance of mature ADAM3 on the sperm surface may depend upon the presence of the ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin complex in TGC. Moreover, the formation of the heterodimeric protein complex between the ADAM1b and ADAM2 precursors in TGC may be essential for the localization of the mature forms of these two ADAMs on the sperm surface. The severely reduced levels of ADAM3 in Adam1a-/- and Adam2-/- sperm (16Nishimura H. Cho C. Branciforte D.R. Myles D.G. Primakoff P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 233: 204-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar) led us to postulate a direct association of ADAM3 with ADAM1a, ADAM1b, or ADAM2 and with ADAM1a/ADAM2 or ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin complex in TGC. To investigate this possibility, we carried out immunoprecipitation analysis of protein extracts from TGC of wild-type and three mutant mice using antibodies against ADAM1a, ADAM1b, ADAM2, and ADAM3 (Fig. 5). In TGC of the wild-type and Adam3-/- mice, ADAM2 was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against both ADAM1a and ADAM1b, whereas the immunoprecipitate with anti-ADAM2 antibody contained ADAM1a and ADAM1b in addition to ADAM2. Only ADAM1b and ADAM2 were immunoprecipitated from Adam1a-/- TGC with anti-ADAM1b or anti-ADAM2 antibody. These data are consistent with the presence of ADAM1a/ADAM2 and ADAM1b/ADAM2 fertilin complexes in both wild-type and Adam3-/- TGC and with the absence of only ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin and both fertilins in Adam1a-/- and Adam2-/- TGC, respectively (Figs. 4B and 4D). However, no ADAM3 was immunoprecipitated with antibody against ADAM1a, ADAM1b, or ADAM2 (Fig. 5), indicating that ADAM3 is incapable of forming a protein complex with ADAM1a, ADAM1b, and ADAM2 in TGC. Although many ADAM members exclusively expressed in the testis have been identified, little is known of their roles in TGC during spermatogenesis. We show here a link between the loss of ER-resident ADAM1a (ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin) and the insufficient transport of ADAM3 onto the cell surface. This finding may provide a new viewpoint for the regulation of the localization of fertilization-related sperm proteins by fertilin in TGC. ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin may be implicated in the selective transport of specific sperm proteins, including ADAM3, that function in the sperm ascent into the oviduct (Fig. 2) and/or in the sperm penetration through the layer of cumulus cells (Fig. 3A). Our preliminary experiments indicated that ADAM1a and ADAM3 are partially localized in lipid rafts of TGC (data not shown). The ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin complex may organize the membrane microdomain as a platform in which the selected sperm proteins such as ADAM3 are present, although this fertilin complex is incapable of interacting directly with ADAM3 in TGC (Fig. 5). ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin may be also associated with an unknown protein(s) mediating the transport of ER proteins. Regardless, the molecular mechanism of protein transport catalyzed by ADAM1a/ADAM2 fertilin in the ER of TGC remains to be further elucidated. We thank Dr. D. G. Myles, Dr. P. Primakoff, and K.

However, its evolution through time is poorly understood. Changes in mantle oxidation state should be reflected in the Fe 3+ /Fe 2+ of mantle minerals, and hence in stable iron isotope fractionation. Here it is shown that there are substantial (1.7 per mil) systematic variations in the iron isotope compositions (δ 57/54 Fe) of mantle spinels. Spinel δ 57/54 Fe values correlate with relative oxygen fugacity, Fe 3+ /ΣFe, and chromium number, and provide a proxy of changes in mantle oxidation state, melting, and volatile recycling."

We show that soils within a long-abandoned 60-square-kilometer dryland agricultural complex are substantially richer in bases and phosphorus than are those just outside it, and that this enrichment predated the establishment of intensive agriculture. Climate and soil fertility combined to constrain large dryland agricultural systems and the societies they supported to well-defined portions of just the younger islands within the Hawaiian archipelago; societies on the older islands were based on irrigated wetland agriculture. Similar processes may have influenced the dynamics of agricultural intensification across the tropics."

https://openalex.org/W2066079888,"Posttranslational modification of histones by acetylation, methylation or phosphorylation has emerged as a major mechanism to modify chromatin structure and gene expression. In most cases, transcriptionally active genes display enhanced binding of acetylated histones in their promoters. Activation of histone acetyltransferases or inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) allows chromatin to assume a more open state permitting transcriptional activators to form a preinitiation complex. To our surprise, treatment of cells with the HDAC inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA), inhibits selected interferon β (IFNβ)-stimulated immediate early genes that are activated by the transcription factors Stat1 and Stat2. However, IFNβ activation of IRF-1, which requires tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 homodimers binding to a γ interferon activation sequence in its promoter is not affected by TSA. Exposure of cells to TSA does not alter tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 or Stat2. TSA treatment of cells also does not alter the binding of Stat 1 or Stat2 to the endogenous ISG54 promoter. However, IFNβ-stimulated binding of RNA polymerase II to the ISG54 promoter is prevented by TSA. Interestingly, ectopic expression of IRF9 reverses the inhibitory actions of TSA, suggesting that IRF9 functions to recruit RNA polymerase II to the promoter of interferon-stimulated genes. This particular function of IRF9 requires the activity of histone deacetylases.

This particular function of IRF9 requires the activity of histone deacetylases. The biological actions of interferons (IFNs) 1The abbreviations used are: IFN, interferon; ISG, interferon-stimulated gene; Stat, signal transducer and activator of transcription; ISGF3, interferon-stimulated gene factor 3; ISRE, interferon-stimulated response element; ISG54, interferon-stimulated gene of 54 kDa; TSA, trichostatin A; RNA Pol II, RNA polymerase II; GAS, γ interferon activation sequence; HDAC, histone deacetylase; IRF, interferon regulatory factor. require the activation of immediate early genes, which are mediated by the Stat family of transcription factors (1Larner A.C. Keightley A. Gutkind J.S. Signaling Networks and Cell Cycle Control: The Molecular Basis of Cancer and Other Diseases. 1st Ed. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000: 393-409Google Scholar). Type 1 interferons (IFNα/β) binding to their cell surface receptors initiate a set of events that leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2. Tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2 heterodimerize through their Src homology 2 domains and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9) to form the transcription complex ISGF3. ISGF3 binds to an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) that is present in many IFNα/β-stimulated genes. Alternatively, tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 can form homodimers and bind to a γ interferon activation sequence (GAS), an enhancer in the promoter of genes that do not require the participation of Stat2 or IRF9. Binding of ISGF3 to cellular genes containing ISREs is accompanied by changes in the chromatin structure of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) (2Mirkovitch J. Decker T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Cells incubated with IFNα show altered DNase I sensitivity surrounding the TATA box region as well as the ISRE of ISGs, suggesting that gene activation occurs as a result of chromatin remodeling (2Mirkovitch J. Decker T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, both Stat1 and Stat2 have been shown to interact with the histone acetylases CBP/p300 and GCN5 resulting in increased association of the acetylated histone H3 with the promoter of the IFNα/β-stimulated gene ISG54 (3Bhattacharya S.

From these observations one would predict that incubation of cells with HDAC inhibitors would increase IFN-activated gene expression, and this is indeed the case when one examines IFNγ-stimulated expression of the MHC-II (7Zika E. Greer S.F. Zhu X.-S. Ting J. P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3091-3102Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to IFNγ, interleukin-3-activated Stat5-dependent genes are inhibited in cells exposed to TSA (8Rascle A. Johnston J.A. Amati B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4162-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), suggesting that in certain contexts HDAC activity may be required for Stat-dependent gene activation. Interestingly, other genes in which expression is activated by interleukin-3 in a Stat5-independent manner are unaffected by TSA. To examine the role of HDAC activity in the expression of genes regulated by Stat1 and Stat2, we have assayed for the expression of several RNAs in which genes are controlled by these transcription factors. To our surprise the actions of TSA on IFNα/β-stimulated gene expression were relatively selective. Whereas some IFNα/β-stimulated genes in which expression is regulated by an ISRE were strongly suppressed by TSA, others showed a more modest inhibition. Furthermore, genes in which activation required a GAS element, such as IRF-1, were not altered by TSA treatment. HDAC activity appears to be required to recruit RNA polymerase II (Pol II), but not Stat1 or Stat2, to the promoter of TSA-sensitive genes. The effects of TSA seem to be mediated either directly or indirectly by IRF9. Interestingly, if Pol II is already bound to the promoter and there is basal expression of the gene in the absence of IFNα/β (i.e. IRF-1), then the suppressive actions of TSA are not observed. These data suggest a novel function for IRF9 in promoting RNA Pol II binding to the promoter of genes with activation requiring the activity of HDACs. These results highlight the importance of both histone acetyltransferases and HDACs in controlling potentially distinct targets with regard to Stat-regulated gene expression.

Transfections and Luciferase Assay—Cells (293T) were transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) with 1 μg of ISRE or GAS luciferase reporter plasmids.

Stop codons at amino acids 107, 217, and 327 were introduced into the IRF9 expression plasmid using the Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. After overnight incubation at 37 °C, cells were left untreated or stimulated with IFNβ for 5 h. Cell lysates were prepared, and luciferase activity was measured and normalized to total protein in the extracts. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-PCR—ChIP assays were performed as described by Sakamoto et al. (9Sakamoto S. Qin J. Navarro A. Gamero A. Potla R. Yi T. Zhu W. Baker D.P. Feldman G. Larner A.C.

Stat1 antibody was generated in rabbits as previously described (15Larner A.C. David M. Feldman G.M. Igarashi K. Hackett R.H. Webb D.A.S. Sweitzer S.M. Petricoin III, E.F. Finbloom D.S. Science. 1993; 261: 1730-1733Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). To examine the role of HDACs in type 1 IFN-induced gene expression we used primary immortalized human fibroblasts that were incubated in the presence or absence of TSA and IFNβ (1000 units/ml) for 2 h. RNA was isolated, and RNase protection assays were performed to probe for the presence of ISG54, ISG56, IRF-1, ISG15, and 6–16 RNAs. Actin was analyzed in the same samples as an internal control (Fig. 1A). Incubation of cells with TSA inhibited IFNβ-induced expression of ISG54, ISG15, ISG56, and 6–16, which all contain an ISRE in their promoters. However, this HDAC inhibitor did not significantly affect induction of IRF-1, which is activated through a GAS element. The relative degree of inhibition of the various ISGs by TSA treatment is shown to the right of the RNase protection assay. TSA inhibition of ISGs that contained an ISRE was somewhat variable with ISG15 and 6–16 being less inhibited than ISG54 and ISG56. To determine whether incubation of cells with TSA alters IFNβ-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 and their ability to bind DNA, we performed both immunoblots with phospho-specific antibodies and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Cells were incubated with IFNβ in the presence or absence of TSA for 30 min, and whole cell (Fig. 1B) or nuclear (Fig. 1C) extracts were prepared. IFNβ-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 as well as serine phosphorylation of Stat1 was analyzed by immunoblots using phospho-specific antibodies. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2 is required for them to dimerize and bind to DNA, whereas serine phosphorylation of certain Stats including Stat1 (but not Stat2) is required for their maximal transactivation function (16David M. Petricoin III, E.F. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 17Zhang W. Wagner B.J. Ehrenman K. Schaefer A.W. De Maria C.T. Crater D. DeHaven K. Long L. Brewer G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Incubation of cells with TSA had no effect on either IFNβ-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 or Stat2 or phosphorylation of serine 727 of Stat1 (Fig. 1B). These findings were confirmed using electrophoretic mobility shift assays to analyze the binding of ISGF3 (Stat1, Stat2, and IRF9) to an ISRE probe (Fig. 1C, upper panel) or Stat1 homodimers to a GAS element (Fig. 1C, lower panel). To determine whether the inhibitory actions of TSA were being exerted through the ISRE of ISG54 as opposed to another regulatory region in the promoter, we performed luciferase reporter assays. Reporter constructs containing either the ISRE of the ISG54 promoter or the GAS element of the IRF-1 promoter were transfected into 293T cells. IFNβ stimulated both ISRE- and GAS-dependent luciferase activities in cells transfected with these reporters (Fig. 2). Although incubation of cells with TSA inhibited IFNβ-stimulated ISG54-ISRE luciferase activity more than 80%, IFNβ induction of the IRF-1-GAS luciferase activity was not altered by treatment of cells with TSA. Similar results were observed when cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter containing the ISRE sequence of the ISG15 promoter (data not shown). These results imply that most if not all of the actions of TSA are directed toward the ISRE and not other elements in the promoters of ISRE-containing genes. Although IFNβ activation of Stat1 and Stat2 and their ability to bind DNA was not affected by incubation of cells with TSA, we wanted to determine whether binding of these Stats to the endogenous ISG54 and IRF-1 promoters was altered by this HDAC inhibitor. To address this issue, we performed ChIP assays. Human fibroblasts were incubated with or without IFNβ for 30 min in the presence or absence of TSA. Cells were fixed with formaldehyde, and chromatin was isolated and immunoprecipitated with Stat1, Stat2, or a RNA polymerase II-specific antiserum. As a control for nonspecific background, chromatin was also precipitated with antiserum that recognizes β-actin. Immunoprecipitated chromatin was then subject to PCR with primers corresponding to the promoters of ISG54 or IRF-1 (Fig. 3) (9Sakamoto S. Qin J. Navarro A. Gamero A. Potla R. Yi T. Zhu W. Baker D.P.

Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13455-13462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). IFNβ treatment of fibroblasts induced the binding of both Stat1 and Stat2 to the ISG54 promoter (Fig. 3A, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 5) and of Stat1 to the IRF-1 promoter (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 2). TSA treatment of cells had no effect on the ability of either Stat to bind to the ISG54 (Fig. 3B, lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6) or IRF-1 (lanes 2 and 3) genes. In striking contrast, TSA completely inhibited the binding of RNA Pol II to the ISG54 promoter (Fig. 3A, lanes 7–9). RNA Pol II constitutively associates with the IRF-1 promoter, and this association was modestly increased in cells incubated with IFNβ (Fig. 3B, lanes 4–6). The slightly enhanced binding of RNA Pol II to the IRF-1 promoter in IFNβ-treated cells was variable, as was the reversal of this binding in cells exposed to TSA. However, importantly, TSA did not alter the basal or IFNα/β-enhanced binding of RNA Pol II to the IRF-1 gene. We did not observe any binding of RNA Pol II to the ISG54 promoter in untreated cells. These results suggest that HDAC activity is required for recruitment of RNA Pol II to the promoter of genes that contain an ISRE. However, the binding of Stat1 and Stat2 to the ISG54 promoter per se is clearly not directly related to the ability of HDACs to induce RNA Pol II binding to the gene. The mechanism by which HDAC activity affects the binding of RNA Pol II to the promoter in the context of the ISRE is unclear. To determine whether any of the known components of ISGF3 (Stat1, Stat2, or IRF9) might be targets for HDAC, we transfected 293T cells with an ISG54 luciferase reporter (see Fig. 2) and cDNA expression vectors that encode Stat1, Stat2, or IRF9 (Fig. 4). 24 h post-transfection cells were incubated with or without IFNβ or TSA for 6 h, cell extracts were prepared, and luciferase activity was assayed. Incubation of cells with TSA inhibited IFNβ-stimulated ISRE reporter activity (Fig. 4A, lane 3 versus 4). Co-expression of either Stat1 or Stat2 (Fig. 4A, upper panel) had no effect on the inhibitory actions of TSA (lanes 7 versus 8 and 11 versus 12), whereas expression of IRF9 completely reversed the inhibitory actions of TSA (Fig. 4B, upper panel, lanes 7 and 8). IRF9 contains a DNA binding domain in its N-terminal 127 amino acids and a domain that associates with tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2 in the 160 amino acids at its C terminus. These domains are separated by 100 amino acids (19Veals S.A. Santa Maria T. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 196-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which domains in IRF9 are required to reverse the inhibitory actions of TSA, we introduced stop codons in the IRF9 expression plasmid to generate proteins that contain either the N-terminal 107, 217, or 326 amino acids of the full-length protein. The cDNAs were transfected into 293T cells with the ISG54 luciferase reporter as in Fig. 4B, and luciferase activity was determined in cells incubated with or without IFNβ in the presence or absence of TSA (Fig. 4C). Expression of the N-terminal 107 amino acids of IRF9 failed to reverse the inhibitory actions of TSA. Interestingly, expression of the linker domain of the protein in the context of the N terminus partially reversed the inhibitory effects of TSA, whereas expression of the first 326 amino acids of the protein fully reversed the inhibitory actions of TSA. This latter cDNA expresses most but not all of the domain in IRF9 required for its interaction with Stat1 and Stat2 (19Veals S.A. Santa Maria T. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 196-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chromatin remodeling is well documented to correlate with transcriptionally active genes. Covalent modifications of histones either through acetylation, phosphorylation, or methylation are well described events that alter access of RNA polymerase II and other transcription factors to various promoters. Acetylation of the histone H3 through recruitment of histone acetylases via Stat1 or Stat2 has been implicated as an important event in IFNα/β-stimulated early response genes such as ISG54 (5Paulson M. Press C. Smith E. Tanese N. Levy D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Results presented in this report clearly indicate that HDAC activity is required for IFNβ-mediated expression of ISRE-dependent genes. The inhibitory effects of TSA are not the same on all ISRE-activated genes, and at least the expression of one gene (IRF-1) requiring Stat1 homodimers binding a GAS element is not altered by this HDAC inhibitor. These results partially substantiate those recently reported by Nusinzon and Horvath (20Nusinzon I. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to their results, we find that genes in which activation is mediated by a GAS enhancer are not affected by TSA. Our results also provide convincing evidence that inhibition of HDAC activity directly correlates with its potential role in recruiting RNA polymerase II to the endogenous promoters and has no effect on the binding of Stat1 or Stat2 to the ISRE of ISG54 (Fig. 3). RNA Pol II is associated with the IRF-1 promoter in untreated cells, and its binding is not disrupted by TSA. This observation suggests that RNA Pol II that is already associated with the promoter is independent of the activity of HDACs, whereas recruitment of RNA Pol II to ISRE-containing promoters requires HDAC activity. These results are distinct from those reported by Rascle et al. (8Rascle A. Johnston J.A. Amati B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4162-4173Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), where interleukin-3-stimulated Stat5-dependent genes were inhibited by TSA, and the rate of dissociation of RNA Pol II from the promoters of sensitive genes was enhanced when HDACs were inhibited (20Nusinzon I. Horvath C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In the case of IFNβ-stimulated ISRE-dependent genes, our findings implicate a critical role for IRF9 in mediating the actions of HDACs. Although previous studies have indicated that several IRF family members are acetylated and that acetylation inhibits their ability to bind DNA (21Masumi A. Yamakawa Y. Fukazawa H. Ozato K. Komuro K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25401-25407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 22Caillaud A. Prakash A. Smith E. Masumi A. Hovamessian A.G. Levy D.E. Marie I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49417-49421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), our results do not support the notion that treatment of cells with TSA affects the ability of IRF9 to form an ISRE-binding complex with tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2 (see Fig. 1). However, it was not possible to examine whether TSA treatment of cells alters binding of IRF9 to the endogenous ISG54 promoter, because an IRF9 antibody that functions in ChIP assays was not available. We did not observe acetylation of IRF9 either in the presence or absence of incubation of cells with TSA (data not shown). Therefore, the substrate for HDACs that permits RNA Pol II binding to the promoter and the function of IRF9 in this event remain to be determined. We have been unable to detect an interaction between IRF9 and RNA Pol II using immunoprecipitations with either IRF9 or RNA Pol II antisera suggesting, but not proving, that the effects of IRF9 on RNA Pol II recruitment are not direct. It is notable that expression of only the N-terminal 217 amino acids of IRF9 partially reverses the inhibitory actions of TSA, whereas expression of the first 326 amino acids completely reverses the inhibitory effects of this HDAC inhibitor (Fig. 4C). Although amino acids 1–326 contain part of the domain required for Stat1 and Stat2 to interact with IRF9, the results of Veals et al. (19Veals S.A. Santa Maria T. Levy D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 196-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) would suggest that this truncated version of IRF9 would not bind tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 and Stat2. The fact that incubation of cells with TSA does not inhibit formation of ISGF3, combined with the truncation studies, makes it likely that the domain in IRF9 that is TSA-sensitive is distinct from the domain needed to bind Stat1 and Stat2. Studies are in progress to identify the potential targets of TSA that interact with the C terminus of IRF9. We thank Dr. Curt Horvath for providing us with the ISG54 ISRE luciferase construct."

Two-piece split inteins capable of protein trans-splicing have been found in nature and engineered in laboratories, but they all have a similar split site corresponding to the endonuclease domain of the intein. Can inteins be split at other sites and do trans-splicing? After testing 13 split sites engineered into a Ssp DnaB mini-intein, we report the finding of three new split sites that each produced a two-piece split intein capable of protein trans-splicing. These three functional split sites are located in different loop regions between β-strands of the intein structure, and one of them is just 11 amino acids from the beginning of the intein. Because different inteins have similar structures and similar β-strands, these new split sites may be generalized to other inteins. We have also demonstrated for the first time that a three-piece split intein could function in protein trans-splicing.

These findings have implications for intein structure-function, evolution, and uses in biotechnology. An intein is a protein-intervening sequence that catalyzes a protein-splicing reaction in which the intein sequence is precisely excised and its flanking sequences (N- and C-exteins) join with a peptide bond to produce the mature host protein (spliced protein) (1Perler F.B.

The mechanism of protein splicing typically has four steps: two acyl rearrangements at the two splicing junctions, a trans-esterification between the two junctions, and a cyclization of the Asn residue at the C-terminal junction (2Xu M.Q.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). These bifunctional inteins are ∼350–550 amino acids (aa) 1The abbreviations used are: aa, amino acid; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; N- and C-intein, N- and C-terminal part of the intein, respectively; M-intein, middle part of the intein. long, although some extra large inteins are up to 1650 aa long and also contain tandem repeats (13Yang J.

Nearly 200 intein and intein-like sequences have been found in a wide variety of host proteins and in microorganisms belonging to bacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes (12Perler F.B.

A. 1997; 94: 7851-7856Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Inteins generally share only low levels of sequence similarity, but they share striking similarities in structure, reaction mechanism, and evolution (4Paulus H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 447-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 18Perler F.B. Cell. 1998; 92: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 19Liu X.Q. Annu. Rev.

Microbiol. 2002; 56: 263-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is thought that inteins first originated with just the splicing domain and then acquired the endonuclease domain, with the latter conferring genetic mobility to the intein. During intein evolution, however, some inteins lost their endonuclease domain to become mini-inteins consisting of just the ∼130-aa protein-splicing domain plus a linker sequence of various lengths in place of the endonuclease domain (12Perler F.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 22Telenti A. Southworth M. Alcaide F. Daugelat S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Perler F.B. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An interesting event of intein evolution is the loss of sequence continuity in some inteins, which apparently produced the DnaE split intein that exists in two fragments and is capable of protein trans-splicing (23Wu H. Hu Z. Liu X.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9226-9231Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). A pair of split DnaE genes produces two precursor polypeptides, with one consisting of the N-terminal part of DnaE (N-extein) followed by the N-terminal part of intein (N-intein) and another consisting of the C-terminal part of DnaE (C-extein) preceded by the C-terminal part of the intein (C-intein). The N- and C-inteins, through their structural complementation, can reassemble and catalyze a protein trans-splicing reaction to produce a mature DnaE. This two-piece split intein has since been found in many cyanobacterial species (14Liu X.Q. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26315-26318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24Caspi J. Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). These naturally occurring split inteins most likely originated from a contiguous intein sequence as a result of genomic rearrangement(s) that broke the intein coding sequence. Interestingly, all these DnaE split inteins share the same split site, which may be explained by a single origin for all these split inteins. However, it may also suggest that splitting at any other site is incompatible with protein trans-splicing and therefore not tolerated, which can be examined by splitting inteins at other sites followed by testing for possible trans-splicing. Synthetic two-piece split inteins have been engineered before in laboratories by splitting the coding sequences of contiguous inteins, but their split sites corresponded with those of the naturally occurring split inteins (25Southworth M.W. Adam E. Panne D. Byer R. Kautz R. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 26Mills K.V. Lew B.M. Jiang S. Paulus H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both naturally occurring and synthetic split inteins have found many practical uses, which include producing trans-spliced recombinant proteins and circularized proteins or peptides for various purposes (28Evans Jr., T.C.

Methods. 2001; 24: 257-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Finding new split sites for functional split inteins can be useful for the many emerging applications involving protein trans-splicing techniques. Inteins have been viewed as protein equivalents of introns because of some superficial similarities between inteins and self-splicing introns. Both are intervening sequences, can excise themselves through self-splicing, and are genetically mobile through a similar homing mechanism. Furthermore, the natural occurrence of two-piece split inteins parallels the natural occurrence of two-piece split group II introns. A group II intron can also exist in three pieces, and further fragmentation is believed to have led to the origin of nuclear spliceosomal introns (31Cavalier-Smith T. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 145-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 32Bonen L. Vogel J. Trends Genet. 2001; 17: 322-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Can inteins also function when split at different sites and into more than two pieces? This is not as predictable as for group II introns, which have clear base-pairings between the split pieces. The naturally occurring split inteins do not answer this question, because they all have the same split site corresponding to the insertion site of the endonuclease domain in contiguous intein sequences. Previously reported synthetic split inteins do not answer this question either, because they all have a split site similar to that of naturally occurring split inteins that either corresponded to or was inside the endonuclease domain. This question has become more important with the recent discovery of apparent protein-splicing products in human (33Hanada K. Yewdell J.W. Yang J.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), because in this case the reaction mechanism was not known and an intein-like sequence not found. If an intein could be split into multiple pieces, as a group II intron could become a spliceosomal intron, the resulting residual intein sequence could have lost most or all of the known intein signatures. In this study, we tested a series of potential split sites in the Ssp DnaB mini-intein to produce new split inteins capable of protein trans-splicing. Four new split sites were shown to produce various levels of protein trans-splicing activity. In addition, a synthetic three-piece split intein was constructed and shown to be capable of protein trans-splicing. We discuss their implications on intein structure-function, evolution, and potential uses in biotechnology. Constructing Split Intein Genes—The coding sequence of Ssp DnaB mini-intein was isolated from the previously described pMST plasmid (27Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) as an 842-bp XhoI-HindIII DNA fragment. This was placed in a pBluescript plasmid for easier subsequent manipulations. To insert a spacer sequence to split the intein coding sequence, a restriction enzyme cutting site (KasI or MfeI) was introduced at the intended splitting site. This was achieved by inverse PCR on the circular plasmid, using a pair of oligonucleotide primers specific to the split site in diverging orientations. The two primers have KasI or MfeI recognition sequences at their 5′-ends, so that a KasI or MfeI cutting site was created at the intended splitting site after the PCR-amplified linear DNA was circularized. A short spacer sequence, produced by annealing two oligonucleotides, was then inserted at the KasI or MfeI cutting site. The spacer sequence contained a stop codon followed by a ribosome binding sequence and a start codon. The resulting split intein coding sequence was isolated as a XhoI-HindIII DNA fragment and placed back into the pMST expression plasmid to replace the original intein coding sequence. The high fidelity Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used in the PCR reactions, and correct DNA sequences were confirmed through DNA sequencing. Protein Splicing in Escherichia coli Cells—Production of plasmid-encoded recombinant proteins in E. coli cells, gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting was carried out as previously described (27Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 34Liu X.Q. Yang J. Meng Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46826-46831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells containing individual expression plasmid were grown in liquid Luria broth medium at 37 °C to late log phase (A600, 0.5). IPTG was added to a final concentration of 0.8 mm to induce production of the recombinant proteins, and the induction was continued for 3 h. Cells were then harvested and lysed in SDS- and dithiothreitol-containing gel loading buffer in a boiling water bath before electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Western blotting was carried out with either anti-maltose binding protein monoclonal antibody (New England Biolabs) or anti-thioredoxin monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), using the Enhanced Chemi-Luminescence detection kit. Intensity of the protein band was estimated using a gel documentation system (Gel Doc 1000 coupled with Molecular Analyst software; Bio-Rad). Two-piece Split Inteins and Protein trans-Splicing—To find new split sites capable of supporting protein trans-splicing, we chose the previously engineered Ssp DnaB mini-intein that was proficient in protein cis- and trans-splicing (27Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In choosing new split sites in the intein sequence, we considered the likely three-dimensional structure of the intein, reasoning that splitting in loop regions between β-strands would more likely produce protein trans-splicing activity. Because a crystal structure of the Ssp DnaB mini-intein was not available at the beginning of this study, we predicted likely β-strands through sequence comparisons with inteins of known crystal structures (data not shown). Our predictions turned out to be largely correct when the crystal structure of this mini-intein became available recently (6Ding Y. Xu M.Q. Ghosh I. Chen X. Ferrandon S. Lesage G. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39133-39142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 and Table I, fourteen different split sites (S0-S13) were selected in the Ssp DnaB mini-intein sequence, with most of them located in a loop region between predicted β-strands. To produce and test the new split inteins in E. coli, we used a previously described pMST plasmid that encodes a fusion protein consisting of the Ssp DnaB mini-intein between a maltose binding protein (M) at the N terminus and a thioredoxin (T) at the C terminus (Fig. 2). Splitting the intein coding sequence was achieved by inserting a spacer sequence at individual selected sites. The spacer sequence contained a stop codon, a ribosome binding (Shine-Dalgarno) sequence, and a start codon. This produced a two-gene operon behind an IPTG-inducible promoter. The first gene encodes the N-protein consisting of the M sequence (N-extein) followed by the N-terminal part of intein (N-intein), and the second gene encodes the C-protein consisting of the C-intein followed by the T sequence (C-extein). Similar gene constructs had been used in previous studies of split inteins (14Liu X.Q. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26315-26318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), so the protein products were readily identified in Western blotting.Table IList of tested split sitesSplit sitePositionaAmino acid position preceding the split site.N-proteinbPredicted from gene constructs of Figs. 2 and 3.C-proteinbPredicted from gene constructs of Figs. 2 and 3.Efficiency of splicingcAmount of spliced protein divided by the sum of spliced protein and C-protein.kDakDa%S0Gln-10555.818.3100S1Ala-1144.929.148S2Glu-2546.427.50S3Glu-3547.726.30S4Lys-5349.724.30S5Ala-7151.722.30S6Asp-7952.721.396S7Ser-8853.820.271S8Glu-10055.218.8100S9Glu-13258.715.20S10Pro-14059.614.30S11Asn-14860.413.50S12Lys-4448.725.30S13Gly-6450.923.00S1 and S0Ala-11 and Gln-10544.918.387-100a Amino acid position preceding the split site.b Predicted from gene constructs of Figs. 2 and 3.c Amount of spliced protein divided by the sum of spliced protein and C-protein.

Each split gene resulted from insertion of a spacer sequence (boxed) at one of the selected sites (Fig. 1, S1-S13), in which a stop codon, a ribosome binding sequence, and a start codon are underlined.

The resulting total cellular proteins were resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Relevant protein products were identified through Western blotting (Fig. 2) and by their predicted sizes (Table I). As seen in Fig. 2, a spliced protein was observed with four split sites (S1, S6, S7, and S8), indicating protein trans-splicing activity. To estimate the efficiency of protein trans-splicing, the intensity of individual protein bands on Western blot was used to measure the amount of that protein, and the efficiency of protein trans-splicing was calculated as the amount of spliced protein divided by the sum of the spliced protein and the C-protein. The efficiency of protein splicing was estimated to be 48, 96, 71, and 85% for split sites S1, S6, S7, and S8, respectively. The other split sites showed no detectable amount of spliced protein (representatives shown in Fig. 2), indicating a lack of protein trans-splicing activity. The N-protein was not used in estimating efficiency because it was from the first gene of the two-gene operon and always accumulated in excessive amounts compared with C-protein from the second gene. This was most likely because of a less than 100% translational coupling of the two genes, as had been observed previously. Three-piece Split Intein Showing Protein trans-Splicing Activity—We then tested the possibility of producing a three-piece split intein capable of protein trans-splicing, encouraged by the finding of multiple new split sites compatible with protein trans-splicing. We chose to split the Ssp DnaB mini-intein at both the new split site, S1, and the previously known split site, S0 (27Wu H. Xu M.Q. Liu X.Q. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1387: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Because S1 and S0 are the farthest separated sites that showed protein trans-splicing, we reasoned that the resulting larger size (94 aa) of the middle part of the intein (M-intein) would be better for stability in E. coli cells. The resulting N-terminal part (N-intein) and the C-terminal (C-intein) part of the intein were 11 and 49 aa long, respectively. A three-gene operon was constructed and introduced into E. coli cells to produce the N-protein (maltose binding protein plus N-intein), the M-intein, and the C-protein (C-intein plus thioredoxin) in that order (Fig. 3, Plasmid A). Western blotting using specific antibodies revealed a spliced protein (maltose binding protein plus thioredoxin) in addition to the N-protein precursor. As a negative control, no spliced protein was observed when the M-intein gene was absent (Fig. 3, Plasmid B). When the M-intein gene was placed behind the C-protein gene (Fig. 3, Plasmid C), the spliced protein was again observed as it was when the M-intein was in front of the C-protein gene. As expected, the N-protein was produced in excessive amounts, because it was in the first position of the three-gene operon. When the C-protein gene was in the second position and in front of the M-intein gene, a small amount of the C-protein remained unspliced, presumably because of less production of the M-intein from its gene at the third position. However, when the C-protein gene was at the third position and after the M-intein gene, all C-protein was spliced. After testing 13 split sites in the Ssp DnaB mini-intein, we have found four functional split sites capable of producing a protein trans-splicing activity. Results of this functional analysis can shed more light on intein structure-function when considered together with the recently reported crystal structure of this intein (6Ding Y. Xu M.Q. Ghosh I. Chen X. Ferrandon S. Lesage G. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39133-39142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig. 4, the four functional split sites (S1, S6, S7, S8) are all located in loop regions between β-strands, indicating that these loop regions are flexible and can tolerate disruptions. Interestingly, the S6 site corresponds to a location where an extra tongs subdomain was found in the Sce VMA intein crystal structure, and the subdomain appeared to assist the homing endonuclease in DNA binding (8Werner E. Wende W. Pingoud A. Heinemann U. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3962-3971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the flexibility and tolerance at the S6 site that were indicated by our findings may have been exploited in nature in the placing of the tongs subdomain. Similarly, the S8 site and the nearby S0 site correspond to a location where the homing endonuclease domain is placed in natural inteins. In contrast to the functional split sites in loop regions, three of the non-functional split sites (S4, S9, and S12) all broke the long β-strands (β5 and β10). This demonstrated the importance of maintaining the integrity of the long β-strands, which structurally form the backbone of the horseshoe-shaped intein. Not all split sites in a loop region produced trans-splicing activity, indicating that some loop sequences cannot be broken, possibly because they are required to hold the flanking β-strands in correct conformation. Because our intein-splitting methods also added two amino acid residues to each of the split ends, we cannot rule out the possibility that these additional residues might have prevented the trans-splicing function. For trans-splicing to occur, the two precursor proteins need to recognize and bind each other. The extein sequences, maltose binding protein and thioredoxin, are unlikely contributors to this binding because they are from unrelated proteins not known to interact. Therefore, the two intein fragments must be responsible for bringing about the recognition and binding of the precursor proteins, and for this they need to have sufficient structural interactions. The crystal structure of this Ssp DnaB mini-intein (6Ding Y. Xu M.Q. Ghosh I. Chen X. Ferrandon S. Lesage G. Rao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39133-39142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), which is very similar to the protein-splicing domain of other inteins (5Duan X. Gimble F.S.

Biol. 2000; 300: 889-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), has several pairs of antiparallel β-strands. The two strands of each pair are expected to interact through various noncovalent bonds, including hydrogen bonds (10Hall T.M. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Koonin E.V. Beachy P.A. Leahy D.J. Cell. 1997; 91: 85-97Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). For all of the tested split sites, except S2 and S10, the resulting intein fragments could potentially interact through at least one pair of antiparallel β-strands (Fig. 4). For four of the five functional split sites (S6, S7, S8, and S0), the resulting intein fragments could interact through the ultralong antiparallel β-strands β5/β10. Three of the sites (S6, S8, S0) could interact through one additional antiparallel β-strand (β7/β8 or β9/β10), which may explain the high trans-splicing efficiencies observed with them. The functional split site S1 is perhaps most interesting because it produced an N-intein that is just 11 aa long and could interact with the C-intein through just the short antiparallel β-strands β2/β3. This minimal interaction between the N- and C-inteins may explain the relatively low efficiency of trans-splicing observed with the S1 split site. We have also demonstrated for the first time that a three-piece split intein could function in protein trans-splicing. For the three-piece split intein to function, the M-intein would need to interact and bind properly with both the small N-intein and the C-intein, which probably involves the short antiparallel β-strands β2/β3 and the long antiparallel β-strands β5/β10, respectively. It is not known whether the M-intein could be reused after trans-splicing one pair of the N- and C-proteins, which would require reversible binding of the M-intein to the N- and C-inteins. Interestingly, the three-piece split intein with both S1 and S0 split sites exhibited more efficient trans-splicing than the two-piece split intein with just the S1 split site. This is not what one would normally expect, because a three-molecule reaction (such as for the three-piece split intein) is in general more difficult than a two-molecule reaction (such as for the two-piece split intein). One possible explanation is that the M-intein folded better as a separate protein compared with when it was a part of the C-intein in the two-piece split intein case. Our findings have implications for intein evolution. In nature, a split intein could arise from a contiguous intein as a result of genomic rearrangements breaking the intein coding sequence. Considering the large number of naturally occurring split inteins (14Liu X.Q. Yang J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26315-26318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Wu H.

Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), why do they all have a single and common split site? Because we found multiple new split sites compatible with trans-splicing, we can now exclude the possibility that this common split site of natural split inteins is the only site compatible with protein trans-splicing. Our results therefore support the theory that all the known natural split inteins had a single origin from a contiguous intein (24Caspi J. Amitai G. Belenkiy O. Pietrokovski S. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1569-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our findings have also demonstrated the potential for split inteins of independent origins to have different split sites and for additional intein fragmentation to produce split inteins consisting of three or even more pieces. Highly fragmented inteins could be difficult to recognize in nature. Because intein sequences are poorly conserved, intein recognition has relied on a combination of three criteria: a large intervening sequence in the host protein, multiple and modestly conserved intein sequence motifs, and a few conserved residues at the splice junctions. However, our results showed that the N-intein linked to the N-extein could be as short as 11 aa and that a major portion (M-intein) of the intein could be unlinked from both exteins. In addition, other studies have shown that even the few conserved junction residues can be absent (35Southworth M.W. Benner J. Perler F.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5019-5026Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 36Chen L. Benner J. Perler F.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 20685-20691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings could suggest the possible existence of highly derived inteins that show no obvious sequence similarity to known self-splicing inteins. This possibility could be reminiscent of the presumed emergence of nuclear spliceosomal introns from self-splicing group II introns, and one may not recognize a spliceosomal intron using criteria for group II introns. The recent report of apparent protein-splicing activity in human (33Hanada K. Yewdell J.W. Yang J.C. Nature. 2004; 427: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), which was without a recognizable intein sequence, highlights this possibility, indeed. The ability to produce artificial split inteins with new and multiple split sites also has implications for intein study and intein use in biotechnology. Previously known split inteins, naturally occurring or artificial, all have a similar split site corresponding to or inside the endonuclease domain. They have shown variability and limitations in solubility, reaction kinetics, and compatibility with certain extein sequences (20Martin D.D. Xu M.Q. Evans Jr., T.C.

New split sites identified in this study that produced intein fragments of various lengths and interacting β-strands can be useful for comparative studies of split intein properties such as fragment binding and reaction kinetics; they can also expand the toolbox of protein trans-splicing in biotechnology. Although these functional split sites were discovered in the Ssp DnaB mini-intein, they most likely can be generalized to other inteins, considering that different inteins showed a similar splicing domain structure consisting of similar β-strands."
https://openalex.org/W2054826743,"Despite the role of sphingolipid/cholesterol rafts as signaling platforms for Fcgamma receptor II (FcgammaRII), the mechanism governing translocation of an activated receptor toward the rafts is unknown. We show that at the onset of FcgammaRII cross-linking acid sphingomyelinase is rapidly activated. This enzyme is extruded from intracellular compartments to the cell surface, and concomitantly, exofacially oriented ceramide is produced. Both non-raft and, to a lesser extent, raft sphingomyelin pools were hydrolyzed at the onset of FcgammaRII cross-linking. The time course of ceramide production preceded the recruitment of FcgammaRII to rafts and the receptor phosphorylation. Exogenous C(16)-ceramide facilitated clustering of FcgammaRII and its association with rafts. In contrast, inhibition of acid sphingomyelinase diminished both the ceramide generation and clustering of cross-linked FcgammaRII. Under these conditions, tyrosine phosphorylation of FcgammaRII and receptor-accompanying proteins was also reduced. All the inhibitory effects were bypassed by treatment of cells with exogenous ceramide. These data provide evidence that the generation of cell surface ceramide is a prerequisite for fusion of cross-linked FcgammaRII and rafts, which triggers the receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and signaling."

In type II systems, which are found in most bacteria and plants, the individual synthetic steps are catalyzed by a series of discrete proteins encoded by unique genes (1Rock C.O. Cronan J.E. Biochim.

Four reactions are required to complete each round of fatty acid elongation. In some cases, multiple enzymes are available to catalyze a given step, suggesting that these proteins have different substrate specificities and/or physiological functions.

Unlike the trans-2 double bond, the cis-3 double bond cannot be removed by enoyl-ACP reductase but instead is retained to form the double bonds of the unsaturated fatty acid moieties of the membrane lipids. The fabA gene is essential for growth of E. coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa as shown by both mutational studies (9Cronan Jr., J.E. Silbert D.F. Wulff D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 206-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Silbert D.F. Vagelos P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 11Hoang T.T.

Academic Press, New York1971: 441-464Google Scholar, 12Kass L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3223-3228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is clear that unsaturated fatty acid synthesis is the essential physiological role of FabA because loss of FabA activity in vivo specifically blocks the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (10Silbert D.F. Vagelos P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 12Kass L.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 3223-3228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, fabA mutant strains grow when supplemented with appropriate unsaturated fatty acids, whereas saturated fatty acids fail to support growth (9Cronan Jr., J.E. Silbert D.F. Wulff D.L. J. Bacteriol. 1972; 112: 206-211Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Silbert D.F. Vagelos P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). It was thought that all bacteria that synthesize unsaturated fatty acids during anaerobic growth utilize a FabA protein. However, recent bacterial genome sequences show that many organisms lack a recognizable FabA homologue, although anaerobically grown cells of these organisms are known to contain unsaturated fatty acids (for review see Refs. 13Heath R.J. White S.W. Rock C.O. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 467-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar and 14Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 305-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Indeed in the extant genome sequences FabA homologues are encoded only in the genomes of α- and γ-proteobacteria. Therefore, there seem to be two possibilities to explain anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid synthesis in those bacteria that lack FabA. The first possibility is that chemistry of the pathway is similar to that of E. coli, but the amino acid sequences of the required proteins are sufficiently different from FabA such that they are not recognized as FabA homologues. The second possibility is that different chemistry is used that involves markedly different proteins. It seems that several anaerobic unsaturated fatty acid biosynthetic pathways may exist because Streptococcus pneumoniae, which lacks a FabA homologue, has an enzyme called FabM that performs the key trans-2 to cis-3 isomerization reaction in vitro (the pathway has not yet been confirmed by mutant studies) (8Marrakchi H. Choi K.H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44809-44816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, FabM seems specific for streptococci and hence irrelevant to other FabA-lacking organisms that synthesize unsaturates during anaerobic growth. In the latter bacteria it seems possible that a FabA homologue is present, but the gene has been annotated as encoding a different enzyme. For example several bacterial genomes contain two copies of genes annotated as encoding FabZ proteins. E. coli FabZ is a protein having weak homology (28% identical residues) to FabA. This sequence homology plus the location of the fabZ gene in a cluster of genes involved in lipid A biosynthesis was sufficient for Raetz and co-workers (4Mohan S. Kelly T.M. Eveland S.S. Raetz C.R. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32896-32903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to test whether E. coli FabZ could dehydrate β-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP, a lipid A precursor. This enzyme activity was demonstrated, and thus the FabZ was called β-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP dehydratase (4Mohan S. Kelly T.M. Eveland S.S. Raetz C.R. Anderson M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32896-32903Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, FabZ was later shown to dehydrate β-hydroxyacyl-ACPs of all chain lengths tested (15Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and thus, the designation as β-hydroxymyristoyl-ACP dehydratase is a misnomer. If the FabZs of other organisms have same broad chain length specificity as E. coli FabZ (15Heath R.J. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27795-27801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), then the presence of a second fabZ gene seems redundant unless the encoded protein performs another function such as introduction of a cis double bond. Therefore, it seemed possible that a class of proteins having much stronger sequence similarity to E. coli FabZ than to E. coli FabA might posses the enzymatic capability of FabA, i.e. the ability to introduce a cis double bond. We report that this is the case in the Gram-positive pathogenic bacterium, Enterococcus faecalis V583, an organism having a fatty acid composition very similar to that of E. coli (16Montgomerie J.Z. Kalmanson G.M. Guze L.B. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 73-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wilkins P.O. Arch. Microbiol. 1982; 132: 211-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). FabA is not the sole E. coli enzyme specifically required for unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, FabB is also essential (18Cronan Jr., J.E. Birge C.H. Vagelos P.R. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 601-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A similar result has been reported for P. aeruginosa (11Hoang T.T. Schweizer H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5326-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). FabB is β-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (19Ulrich A.K. de Mendoza D. Garwin J.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 221-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Garwin J.L. Klages A.L. Cronan Jr., J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11949-11956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an enzyme thought to channel the biosynthetic intermediate made by FabA into the mainstream fatty acid synthetic pathway. Consistent with this view FabA and FabB show covariance within bacterial genomes (14Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 305-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Indeed, in the α-proteobacteria and pseudomonads (unlike other γ-proteobacteria such as E. coli), the fabA and fabB genes are found in two-gene operons (11Hoang T.T. Schweizer H.P. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5326-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 305-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Therefore, given a protein with FabA function, we expected that although E. faecalis has no recognizable FabB homologue, the genome should encode a protein having FabB function. We report that one of the FabF homologues of E. faecalis has FabB function. Therefore, the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in E. faecalis appears to be catalyzed by two proteins that have been consistently annotated as having no specific roles in the introduction of the cis double bond.

Strain MG1655 and MH121(fabA::cat) carrying pHW19 or pHW20 were cultured in 500 ml of LB medium, and arabinose (0.01%) was added. The cultures were grown at 37 °C to late log phase. Then the cultures were centrifuged, and the cells were resuspended in 5 ml of lysis buffer (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA) and lysed in a French pressure cell at 18,000 lb/in2. The lysate was centrifuged in a JA-20 rotor at 35,000 × g at 4 °C for 1 h to remove cell debris. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 45% of saturation, and the precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation. Additional ammonium sulfate was added to bring the supernatant to 80% of saturation, and the precipitated protein was collected by centrifugation. The protein pellet was dissolved in 2 ml of lysis buffer and dialyzed for 5 h at 4 °C against 2 liters of the same buffer. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard. In Vitro Fatty Acid Synthesis Assay—The fatty acid synthesis assay mixtures contained 0.1 m LiCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μm octanoyl-ACP, 0.175 mm NADH, 0.149 mm NADPH, 54 μm ACP, and 30 μg of protein extracts of strain MG1655 or of MH121carrying various plasmids in a final volume of 40 μl. Triclosan, when present, was added to final concentration of 1 mm. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature to allow triclosan to inactivate FabI followed by the addition of 45 μm [2-14C] malonyl-CoA (specific activity, 55 mCi/mmol) to initiate the reaction. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min, the reactions were stopped by placing the tubes in ice slush. Samples of the mixtures were mixed with gel loading buffer and analyzed by conformationally sensitive gel electrophoresis on 15% polyacrylamide gels containing 2.5 m urea at 4 °C (22Lai C.Y. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51494-51503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed, soaked in Enlightning (DuPont), dried, and exposed to x-ray film. Phospholipid Fatty Acid Compositions—The cultures were grown aerobically at different temperature in RB medium overnight, the phospholipids were extracted, and the fatty acid compositions were analyzed by mass spectroscopy as described previously (14Campbell J.W. Cronan Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2001; 55: 305-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). For analysis of radioactive fatty acids, 0.1 ml of a culture grown overnight in LB medium was transferred into 5 ml of RB containing the cyclopropane fatty acid, cis-9,10-methylenehexadecanic acid (0.1%), and l-arabinose (0.01%). The cultures were grown for 1 h, and then 5 μCi of sodium [1-14C]acetate was added, and growth was allowed to continue for 4 h. The phospholipids were then extracted. The acyl chains were then converted to their methyl esters, which were separated by argentation thin layer chromatography and detected by autoradiography as described previously (10Silbert D.F. Vagelos P.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Expression of Plasmid-encoded Proteins—To demonstrate expression of the products of the pET28b-derived plasmids encoding fabF1, fabF2, fabZ1, and fabZ2 were introduced into E. coli strain BL21 (DE3), which contains the gene for T7 RNA polymerase under the control of the isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducible lacUV promoter. The products of the cloned gene were selectively labeled with [35S]methionine as described (23Choi-Rhee E. Cronan J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30806-30812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The proteins were separated on a sodium dodecyl sulfate-12% polyacrylamide gel (pH 8.8). The destained gels were dried, and the labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. The E. faecalis genome encodes two homologues each of FabZ and FabF. The FabZ1 protein shares 25.3 and 41.4% identical residues with E. coli FabA and FabZ, respectively, whereas the respective values for FabZ2 are 22.0 and 50.0 (FabZ1 and FabZ2 share 58.7% identical residues). In each case all FabA active site residues (excepting Asp-84) are conserved. Indeed, if we adopt the focus of Leesong et al. (24Leesong M. Henderson B.S. Gillig J.R. Schwab J.M. Smith J.L. Structure. 1996; 4: 253-264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and consider the amino acid residues that comprise the active site and central helices (residues 60–90 of FabA), then FabZ1 shares 46.4 and 73.3% identical residues with E. coli FabA and FabZ, respectively, whereas the respective values for FabZ2 are 47.1 and 71.0%. Hence, within this key region the two E. faecalis proteins have higher sequence identities to E. coli FabZ than to E. coli FabA, and thus it was very reasonable to annotate these proteins as FabZ homologues rather than FabA homologues. In the case of the E. faecalis FabF proteins both sequences align more closely with E. coli FabF than with E. coli FabB. Both FabF1 and FabF2 are about 36% identical to E. coli FabB and 47–50% identical to E. coli FabF (E. coli FabB and FabF are 37.8% identical, whereas the two E. faecalis FabF proteins are 58.0% identical). The fabZ1 and fabF1 genes are adjacent and transcribed in the same direction with fabF1 being located upstream of fabZ1 (25Paulsen I.T. Banerjei L. Myers G.S. Nelson K.E. Seshadri R. Read T.D. Fouts D.E. Eisen J.A. Gill S.R. Heidelberg J.F. Tettelin H. Dodson R.J. Umayam L. Brinkac L. Beanan M. Daugherty S. DeBoy R.T. Durkin S. Kolonay J. Madupu R. Nelson W. Vamathevan J. Tran B. Upton J.

Located upstream of fabF1, but transcribed from the other DNA strand, is a homologue of E. coli fabI, a gene expected to encode an enoyl-ACP reductase. The fabZ2 and fabF2 genes are located within a large cluster of genes that encode homologues of all the proteins known to be required for saturated fatty acid biosynthesis in E. coli. To test the functions of these proteins we cloned the fabZ and fabF genes of E. faecalis into several different E. coli vectors. These included the phage T7 RNA polymerase-dependent vector pET28, which allowed assay of expression of the encoded proteins by labeling cultures with [35S]methionine following the addition of rifampicin to block the synthesis of chromosomally encoded proteins (Fig. 1A). Plasmids that carried the fabZ1, fabZ2, and fabF1 genes expressed proteins of 17, 15, and 45 kDa that correspond to the values expected from the deduced protein sequences of FabZ1 (16.2 kDa), FabZ2 (15.2 kDa), and FabF1 (43.2 kDa). (Note that the expression levels of FabZ1 and FabZ2 are essentially identical when corrected for the differing methionine contents of the two proteins.) Comparable results were obtained in similar experiments with fabF2 (data not shown). Given that these genes could be satisfactorily expressed in the heterologous host (the ribosome-binding sites used were those of vectors pET28 and pBAD24, which are identical), we tested the function of the genes by introduction of various plasmids into several E. coli fab mutant strains. E. faecalis FabZ1 Has FabA Activity Both in Vivo and in Vitro—The fabZ1 and fabZ2 genes were cloned into the arabinose-inducible vector pBAD24 to give pHW19 (fabZ1) and pHW20 (fabZ2), respectively. These plasmids were introduced into two E. coli fabA mutant strains, MH121 and CY57, and the resulting transformants were tested for growth in absence of oleate supplementation. No growth of transformants of either strain was found in absence of oleate (data not shown). Although E. faecalis fabZ1 and fabZ2 failed to complement the E. coli fabA mutants, it remained possible that one or both of these plasmids supported unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, but that the levels of unsaturated fatty acids synthesized were insufficient for growth of the host strain. To test this possibility we introduced the pBAD24-derived plasmids into a derivative of the fabA null mutant strain MH121 that also carried a null mutation in cfa (44Chang Y.Y. Cronan Jr., J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 249-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). These strains were grown in a medium supplemented with a cyclopropane fatty acid, induced with arabinose, and then labeled with [14C]acetate. The cellular phospholipids were extracted, and their fatty acid moieties were converted to their methyl esters that were analyzed by argentation thin layer chromatography, which resolves each of the unsaturated species from the saturated species and from one another. The cfa null mutation was introduced to increase the sensitivity of the assay by preventing conversion of any radioactive unsaturated fatty acids synthesized to their cyclopropane derivatives (which migrate with the saturated species). We found that the strain carrying the fabZ1 plasmid synthesized unsaturated fatty acids, whereas the strain carrying the fabZ2 plasmid did not (Fig. 1B). Similar results were seen in CY57, a strain that carries a temperature-sensitive point mutation in fabA (data not shown). The levels of unsaturated fatty acid synthesized were very low, presumably because of competition between FabZ1 and the host enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) for trans-2-decenoyl-ACP (8Marrakchi H. Choi K.H. Rock C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44809-44816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). FabI would convert trans-2-decenoyl-ACP to decanoyl-ACP and thereby deprive FabZ1 of the isomerization reaction substrate. We tested the competition hypothesis by the addition of low concentrations of triclosan, a specific inhibitor of the E. coli enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) to the strain carrying the fabZ1 plasmid. Upon the addition of 0.1 μg/ml triclosan the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids synthesized increased by >10-fold (Fig. 1B). In contrast triclosan addition to the strain carrying the fabZ2 plasmid failed to result in unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. We attempted to find a concentration of triclosan that would increase the trans-2-decenoyl-ACP available to FabZ1 while retaining sufficient enoyl-ACP reductase activity for growth. We were unsuccessful in these attempts, although we did find conditions that blocked the growth-dependent lysis that occurs upon starvation of fabA strains for unsaturated fatty acids (26Cronan Jr., J.E. Gelmann E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1188-1195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown). We also tested FabZ1 for its ability to replace FabA in a cell-free fatty acid synthesis system prepared from an E. coli fabA null mutant strain (Fig. 2A). Incubation of a cell-free extract of a wild type strain of E. coli with [2-14C]malonyl-CoA, octanoyl-ACP, NADPH, NADH, and ACP results in formation of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids with the latter species being the dominant products. Upon the addition of triclosan the loss of enoyl-ACP reductase activity results in accumulation of trans-2 decenoyl-ACP produced by FabA or FabZ, because this substrate cannot be elongated by a 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase. However, the cis-3-decenoyl-ACP product of FabA is a substrate for 3-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I (FabB) and thus becomes elongated with an acetate unit from malonyl-ACP. The resulting product, 3-keto-cis-5-dodecenoyl-ACP, is then reduced by FabG and dehydrated by FabZ to form trans-2, cis-5-dodecadienoyl-ACP, which cannot be further elongated beca"

The name reflects its close relationship to gp130, the common receptor subunit of the interleukin (IL)-6-type cytokines.

Additionally, we demonstrate Jak1 binding to GPL and its activation in heteromeric complexes with the OSMRβ but also in a homomeric receptor complex. Most interesting, unlike OSMRβ and gp130, GPL is insufficient to mediate ERK1/2 phosphorylation.

Like gp130, the extracellular domain organization of GPL displays five predicted fibronectin type III-like domains (D1–D5); D1 and D2 comprise the cytokine-binding module. However, it lacks the Ig-like domain present at the N terminus of gp130 (1Ghilardi N. Li J. Hongo J.A. Yi S. Gurney A. de Sauvage F.J. J. Biol.

Studies on the IL-6/IL-12 family of cytokine receptors demonstrated that the N-terminal Ig-like domain contributes to binding of many cytokines (10Grötzinger J. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus it seems unlikely that GPL functions in a homomeric receptor complex like the erythropoietin or the thrombopoietin receptor. Indeed, recently published work describes GPL as part of the receptor complex for a novel four-helix bundle cytokine, IL-31 (7Gross J.F. Sprecher C. Hammond A. Dillon S. Dasovich M. Kuijper J.

IL-31 seems most closely related to oncostatin M, leukemia inhibitory factor, and cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1) (7Gross J.F. Sprecher C. Hammond A. Dillon S. Dasovich M. Kuijper J. Kramer J. Grant F.

Foster D. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2003; 14 (A308): 109PubMed Google Scholar), all of which belong to the family of IL-6-type cytokines (13Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Haan S. Hermanns H.M. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). Besides GPL (IL-31Rα), the signaling receptor complex for IL-31 contains the oncostatin M receptor β (OSMRβ), another signaling receptor subunit of the IL-6-type cytokines (14Mosley B. De Imus C. Friend D. Boiani N. Thoma B. Park L.S. Cosman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32635-32643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In the present study we characterize some signaling properties of GPL. In a homomeric as well as heteromeric receptor complex with OSMRβ or gp130, GPL is a strong activator of STAT3 and STAT5, whereas STAT1 is only poorly tyrosine-phosphorylated. We identify tyrosines 652 and 721 in the cytoplasmic region of GPL as the activation sites for STAT5 and STAT3, respectively. GPL recruits Jak1, which is strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated upon receptor activation. However, the receptor fails to recruit the adaptor molecules SHP-2 or Shc, recently shown to be involved in gp130- and OSMR-mediated MAPK activation, respectively (15Stahl N. Farruggella T.J.

Subsequently, we demonstrate that GPL can only activate ERK1/2 when oligomerized with OSMRβ or gp130, but not in a homomeric arrangement. Cell Culture and Transient Transfection—Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 and HEK293T cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 60 mg/liter penicillin. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a water-saturated 5% CO2 atmosphere. HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with 10–20 μg of plasmid DNA by using the calcium phosphate method as described (17Schaper F. Gendo C. Eck M. Schmitz J. Grimm C. Anhuf D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline 1 h before transfection, and their culture medium was changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. For transfection, 62 μl of 2 m CaCl2 was added to the DNA. The solution was then mixed with 500 μl of 2× HBS (10g/liter Hepes, 16 g/liter NaCl, 0.74 g/liter KCl, 0.25 g/liter NaH2PO4·H2O, 2 g/liter glucose, pH 7.05) and added to 10 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The reaction mixture was dispensed onto a 6-well plate. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with 3.5–15 μg of plasmid DNA using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning of GPL—5′ and 3′ GPL fragments were cloned separately from human ovary Marathon-Ready™ cDNA by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the Advantage cDNA polymerase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and touchdown PCR. After the full open reading frame, including 3′- and 5′-nontranslated sequences, had been determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends, gene-specific 3′- and 5′-primers were used to clone full-length GPL cDNA. The primers used amplified the longest possible open reading frame of the receptor, M1KLSP5-738PEH-TKGEV745 (GPL745). The obtained sequence for GPL745 matches the one recently published by Diveu et al. (2Diveu C. Lelievre E. Perret D. Lak-Hal A.H. Froger J. Guillet C. Chevalier S. Rousseau F. Wesa A. Preisser L.

The GPL cDNA was then cloned into PCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). For transfer to expression vectors, the following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-GTTGTAAAGCTTCCTGATACatgaagctctctccc-3′ (sense); 5′-GCAGCAGAATTCttagacttctcccttggtgtgctctg-3′ (antisense).

The expression vectors pSVL-huIL-5Rα/huGPL-(530–745) (α/GPL-(530–745)) and pSVL-huIL-5Rβ/huGPL-(530–745) (β/GPL-(530–745)) were constructed by exchanging the cDNA for the transmembrane and intracellular region of gp130 by the corresponding sequence for GPL (amino acids 530–745), which was obtained using standard PCR and the oligonucleotides 5′-CCGGAATTCgtctttgagattatcctc-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCGGATCCttagacttctcccttgg-3′ (antisense).

The point mutated constructs containing the amino acid substitutions Y652F, Y683F, and Y721F (Fig. 1) were generated by PCR using the appropriate oligonucleotides with either the cDNA for pSVL-β/GPL-(530–745) or pSVL-α/GPL-(530–745) as a template and the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The truncated construct pSVL-β/GPL-(530–626) was obtained by PCR by using a 3′-oligonucleotide incorporating an in-frame termination codon followed by the recognition site for BamHI. The resulting PCR product was inserted into the EcoRI- and BamHI-digested expression plasmid pSVL-β/GPL-(530–745). The integrity of all constructs was verified by DNA sequence analyses using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For better expression in transfected HepG2 cells, XhoI/BamHI fragments comprising the cDNA encoding α/GPL-(530–745) and β/GPL-(530–745) were inserted into XhoI/BglII-digested pCAGGS expression vector (20Nakajima K.

The expression plasmid for Jak1 was kindly provided by Dr. I. M. Kerr (London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London, UK). Cell Lysis, Immunoprecipitations, and Western Blotting—Transfected HEK293T cells were stimulated for 15 min with 20 ng/ml recombinant human IL-5 (Cell Concepts, Umkirch, Germany). Immediately after stimulation, cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 3 μg/ml pepstatin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin), scraped off the dish, and left on ice for 30 min. Lysates were centrifuged with 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Equal amounts of cellular protein were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antibodies raised against Jak1 and IL-5Rβ were used for immunoprecipitation. As reported earlier, cotransfection of Jak1 (1 μg) led to a ligand-independent tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic regions of the various receptors (16Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Schaper F. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40742-40748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After incubation overnight at 4 °C, immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) during a 60-min incubation, washed twice with washing buffer (as lysis buffer, but with only 0.1% Triton X-100), and boiled for 5 min in Laemmli buffer at 95 °C. Immune complexes were analyzed further by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Western blot analysis was conducted using the indicated antibodies and the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). Before reprobing, blots were stripped in 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, for 20 min at 75 °C. Antibodies—The antibodies against IL-5Rβ (S-16) and Jak1 (HR-785) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and used for immunoprecipitation, and the Jak1 antibody was additionally used for Western blots. The antibodies against Shc and STAT3 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY); α-Tyr(P) antibody (Tyr(P)-99), α-STAT1 (E-23), α-STAT5B (C-17), α-SHP2 (C-18), and α-IL-5Rβ (N-20) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibodies raised against active ERK1/2, tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1(Tyr(P)-701), STAT3(Tyr(P)-705), STAT5 (Tyr(P)-694), as well as the α-ERK1/2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Dako (Hamburg, Germany). Reporter Gene Assays—α2M(-215)-luciferase contains the promoter region, -215 to +8, of the rat α2-macroglobulin gene upstream of the luciferase-encoding sequence of plasmid pGL3 basic (Promega, Madison, WI). The SIE-tk-Luc construct contains two copies of the STAT consensus binding sequence from the c-fos promoter upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter (21Coqueret O. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18794-18800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. H. Gascan (INSERM, Angers, France). The IRF1-tk-Luc construct contains the STAT1-responsive element of the irf1 promoter, and the casein-tk-Luc construct includes six repeated STAT-binding elements of the α-casein promoter upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter cloned into the pGL3 vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The cis promoter-Luc reporter construct was kindly provided by Dr. A. Yoshimura (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan) and has been described recently (22Matsumoto A. Masuhara M. Mitsui K. Yokouchi M. Ohtsubo M. Misawa H. Miyajima A. Yoshimura A. Blood. 1997; 89: 3148-3154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It contains ∼540 bases of the upstream region of the cis gene including four STAT5-responsive mammary gland factor boxes. Luciferase activity values were normalized to transfection efficiency monitored by the cotransfected β-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Amersham Biosciences). HepG2 cells were transfected with 6 μg of luciferase reporter construct, 2 μg of β-galactosidase control plasmid, and expression vectors for each receptor construct (1 μg of pCAGGS-based vectors; 6 μg of pSVL-based vectors) using the calcium phosphate transfection method. In the case of the casein-tk and the cis promoter reporter gene, 2 μg of STAT5B expression vector were additionally added. HEK293T cells were transfected with 6 μg of the SIE-tk-Luc or the cis promoter-Luc construct, 2 μgof β-galactosidase control plasmid, and 2.5 μg of each receptor expression vector. Transient transfection was carried out with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours after transfection, cells were stimulated with 10 ng/ml recombinant human IL-5 (Cell Concepts, Umkirch, Germany) for 16 h. Cell lysis and luciferase assays were performed using the Promega luciferase assay system (Promega, Madison, WI). GPL Initiates Signal Transduction in Combination with gp130, OSMRβ, and LIFR—The novel cytokine receptor GPL displays the highest homology to gp130, the common signal transducing receptor of the IL-6-type cytokine family. GPL has been described recently (7Gross J.F. Sprecher C. Hammond A. Dillon S. Dasovich M. Kuijper J. Kramer J. Grant F. Presnell S. Gao Z. Whitmore T. Kuestner R. Maurer M. Bilsborough J. Harder B. Rosenfeld-Franklin M. Mudri S. Johnson J. Clegg C. Ren H.-P. Waggie K. Shea P. Dong D. Bukowski T.R. Parrish-Novak J. Foster D. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2003; 14 (A308): 109PubMed Google Scholar) to constitute in combination with OSMRβ a functional receptor for the novel cytokine IL-31. Therefore, we first studied whether dimerization of GPL with any of the signal transducing receptors of the IL-6 family (gp130, OSMRβ, or LIFR) generates a signaling-competent receptor complex. To become independent of endogenous receptors, we used chimeric receptor constructs. These contain the transmembrane and intracellular regions of the longest isoform of GPL (amino acids 530–745), gp130, LIFR, or OSMRβ fused to the extracellular domain of the interleukin-5 α or β receptor, respectively. In earlier studies we have demonstrated that chimeras containing the full-length cytoplasmic region of the OSMRβ (β/OSMR) are poorly expressed on the cell surface. Hence, we had to use a truncated chimeric construct that lacks the C-terminal 28 amino acids (β/OSMRΔ1) (19Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar), maintaining STAT recruitment and MAPK-activating sites. Compared with all other constructs used in our study, β/OSMRΔ1 displayed similar surface expression levels. A schematic representation of all receptor constructs used is presented in Fig. 1. We cotransfected expression vectors for α/GPL-(530–745), α/OSMRΔ1, α/LIFR, or α/gp130 along with β/GPL-(530–745) into HepG2 hepatoma cells, known to be highly responsive to IL-6-type cytokines. As a read out for STAT3-mediated gene expression, we cotransfected an α2-macroglobulin promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene. As shown in Fig. 2A, GPL initiated signaling in combination with all three receptor chains (lanes 2–4), whereas the β/GPL-(530–745) chimera alone was not sufficient for signaling, as expected (lane 5). This is in accordance with our earlier studies, which demonstrated that both the α- and β-chimera need to be present containing at least the Jak-binding box1 regions to initiate a signaling cascade (18Behrmann I. Janzen C. Gerhartz C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Hermanns H. Heesel B. Graeve L. Horn F. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5269-5274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The α/OSMRΔ1+β/GPL-(530–745) (Fig. 2A, lane 2) and α/gp130+β/GPL-(530–745) (lane 4) combinations were most potent, leading to a 60- and 35-fold induction of the luciferase activity, respectively (right side). The α/LIFR+β/GPL-(530–745) heteromer appeared to have the weakest signaling capacity (Fig. 2A, lane 3). Most interesting, the GPL homodimer also initiated a strong activation of the α2M promoter (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Experiments using an irf1 promoter-based reporter gene construct (Fig. 2B), known to be responsive to STAT1 and STAT3, and an α-casein promoter-based reporter (Fig. 2C) as a mainly STAT5-driven promoter resulted in a similar activation pattern. GPL Cytoplasmic Regions Are Sufficient to Induce Jak/STAT Activation When Dimerized with the OSMRβ or gp130 —The reporter gene assays shown in Fig. 2 have clearly demonstrated that GPL-containing receptor complexes are capable of inducing STAT-dependent promoter activity. To corroborate these findings, we next analyzed the signaling capacities of the GPL/OSMR heteromer (Fig. 3A) and the GPL/gp130 heteromer (Fig. 3B) at a molecular level. In order to obtain higher expression levels of transfected receptor chimeras, we used HEK293T cells for these experiments. In general, cell surface expression levels of the various chimeric receptor constructs were measured by FACS analysis using antibodies recognizing the extracellular parts of IL-5Rα or IL-5Rβ (data not shown). Only experiments with comparable expression of all different receptors were evaluated. Like α/OSMRΔ1+β/gp130, a mimic for the functional oncostatin M receptor, the combination α/OSMRΔ1+β/GPL-(530–745) induced Jak1 as well as STAT3 phosphorylation upon IL-5 stimulation, albeit less pronounced (Fig. 3A, left side, 1st and 3rd panels, lanes 1 and 2). The STAT1 phosphorylation induced by α/OSMRΔ1+β/GPL-(530–745) was barely detectable when compared with the level of STAT1 phosphorylation by α/OSMRΔ1+β/gp130 (Fig. 3A, left side, 5th panel, lanes 1 and 2). Similar results were obtained when examining signaling by the α/gp130+β/GPL-(530–745) heteromer; stimulation of this receptor complex triggered substantial STAT3 tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 2) only slightly weaker than STAT3 activation induced by the homomerized cytoplasmic regions of gp130 (α/gp130+β/gp130) (Fig. 3B, upper panel, lane 1). In this case, STAT1 phosphorylation upon α/gp130+β/GPL-(530–745) complex formation was easily detectable but was weaker than the corresponding signal generated by α/gp130+β/gp130 (Fig. 3B, 3rd panel, compare lanes 1 and 2). To confirm these findings, we next expressed β/GPL-(530–745) together with an OSMR construct that is deleted after its box1/2 domain (α/OSMR-B1/2). In the resulting heteromer, STATs can only be recruited by the GPL tyrosine motifs as all STAT recruitment sites in the OSMR are missing. The α/OSMR-B1/2+β/gp130 complex served as a positive control because it had been shown earlier that gp130 tyrosine motifs can initiate STAT tyrosine phosphorylation (19Hermanns H.M. Radtke S. Haan C. Schmitz-Van de Leur H. Tavernier J. Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6651-6658PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, we examined signaling induced by α/GPL-(530–745)+β/GPL-(530–745), which obviously completely relies on STAT recruitment by GPL. As shown in Fig. 3A (right section), all three dimers were functional; a similar Jak1 phosphorylation was obtained upon stimulation; likewise, a similar STAT3 phosphorylation can be detected in all three cases (Fig. 3A, 1st and 3rd panels, lanes 3–5). Again, GPL is clearly capable of activating STAT1. However, the GPL-mediated STAT1 phosphorylation is relat"

The deep active-site cleft is lined by conserved residues and has been captured in open and closed conformations in two different crystal forms. A substratesized cavity is completely buried in the closed conformation by the ∼8-Å movement of a helix that forms a lid over the active site. The structure therefore suggests residues that likely play critical roles in catalysis and explains the deleterious effect of many of the mutations associated with the disease hereditary coproporphyria.

Heme is one of the most common prosthetic groups of proteins in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. This abundance reflects essential roles in energy metabolism, stress response, oxygen transport, and signal transduction. Accordingly, heme is essential in all organisms tested; heme biosynthetic enzymes have been highly conserved throughout evolution; and mutations in these enzymes cause several human diseases.

Despite these different intracellular localizations, the mature protein sequence has been highly conserved, with the only significant difference being the presence or absence of mitochondrial targeting sequences that are removed during import (20Kruse E.

Mutations of odCPO cause the autosomal dominant disease hereditary coproporphyria, with >20 different odCPO mutations identified in afflicted families (21Martasek P. Semin. Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 25-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In an effort to better understand the biochemical basis for catalytic activity and the deleterious effect of clinically identified mutations, we determined the crystal structure of yeast (S. cerevisiae) odCPO/Hem13p in two different crystal forms at resolutions of 2.0 and 2.4 Å. The enzyme adopts a unique fold that presents two independent active sites on the dimeric structure that are revealed by deep clefts lined with evolutionarily conserved residues. In one crystal form, the cleft is open to bulk solvent, whereas in the other form, movement of two helices closes the cleft entrance to leave a cavity that is the size and shape of a substrate molecule. Finally, mapping of the mutations associated with coproporphyria indicates that most of these changes will destabilize the protein structure or distort the active-site cavity. Expression and Purification of odCPO/Hem13p—A cDNA encoding S. cerevisiae Hem13p was amplified using PCR and cloned into the expression vector pET16B. Protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS (Novagen, Madison, WI) grown in LB medium at 37 °C. Induction with 500 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 = 0.5 was followed by growth for 4 h before harvesting by centrifugation and storing of pellets at -80 °C. Cell pellets from 6 liters of culture were resuspended in 50 ml of lysis buffer (100 mm NaCl and 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) and incubated on ice for 1 h with 1.2 ml of 10 mg/ml lysozyme prior to sonication. The membrane fraction was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid column (QIAGEN Inc., Chats-worth, CA) at 4 °C. The column was washed with 40 ml of buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 2.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, followed by elution of the protein in 30 ml of buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.6, 150 mm imidazole, and 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions containing purified histidine-tagged odCPO/Hem13p were dialyzed against 4 liters of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 5% (v/v) glycerol; concentrated to 25 mg/ml using Centriprep concentrators (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA); and used in the crystallization trials. Crystallization—Form C crystals, named because the protein was cleaved during crystallization, grew with bipyramidal morphology in sitting drops at 21 °C. The reservoir solution (20% polyethylene glycol 3000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, and 0.2 m sodium acetate) was mixed with an equal volume of protein solution in the drop. A washed form C crystal ran with an apparent molecular mass of 30 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel (a weaker band was also seen at 10 kDa). N-terminal sequencing of protein from a form C crystal revealed that the first five residues in the protein were DPRNL, indicating that the crystallized protein was cleaved at Asp6 and suggesting that ∼60-70 of the C-terminal residues had also been removed. The form I crystals grew with rod morphology in sitting drops at 4, 13, and 21 °C. The reservoir solution was 18% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 2% isopropyl alcohol, and 0.2 m sodium acetate. Drops were equal parts protein and reservoir solutions. The form II crystals grew with plate morphology in sitting drops at 21 °C. The reservoir solution was 2.2 m ammonium sulfate and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5. The drops were a 2:1 mixture of protein and reservoir solutions. X-ray Data Collection—All data were collected from crystals maintained at 100 K. Crystals were suspended in rayon loops and plunged into liquid nitrogen. Form C crystals were transferred directly from the crystallization drop to liquid nitrogen. Form I and II crystals were first transferred to a cryoprotectant solution prior to cooling. Cryoprotectant for form I crystals was composed of 10% (v/v) glycerol added to the reservoir solution, and that for form II crystals was composed of 15% (v/v) glycerol added to a 1:1 mixture of reservoir solution and 3.5 m aqueous ammonium sulfate. Data were collected from a single form C crystal using a Rigaku RAXIS-IV imaging plate area detector on a Rigaku RU-H3R rotating anode x-ray source with a chromium anode that generates useable X-rays at 2.29-Å wavelength for increased sulfur anomalous signal. The custom-designed diffraction experiment included Osmic confocal optics to focus the x-ray beam and a helium path enclosure to minimize air absorption and scattering between the sample and detector (22Yang C.

High-resolution data for refinement were collected from a second form C crystal and from a form I crystal at the National Synchrotron Light Source.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—The form C crystal structure was determined by sulfur single wavelength anomalous diffraction phasing. SOLVE (23Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar) was used to locate seven sulfur positions using 3.3-Å data and to calculate phases based on this solution. The M value was 0.27, and the overall Z score was 19. Density modification was performed with RESOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 22-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) to produce an electron density map that allowed building of several strands and helices. Phases from this refined partial model were used to calculate an anomalous difference Fourier map that confirmed the sulfur substructure and found an eighth site. SOLVE and RESOLVE were rerun, fixing the eight sulfur positions, to give a slightly improved map (see Fig. 2). Refinement and rebuilding using 1.9-Å data collected at National Synchrotron Light Source beamline X8C resulted in a model of good stereochemistry and agreement with x-ray terms (see Table I). The form I and II crystal structures were determined by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (25Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4097) Google Scholar) with the CCP4i interface (26CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19664) Google Scholar). The refined form C model was used to determine the form I structure, which has two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The refined form I model was subsequently used to determine the form II structure, which has six molecules in the asymmetric unit. In both cases, model building with the program O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) and refinement with REFMAC5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13707) Google Scholar) were straightforward (see Table I). Structure Determination—Crystals of histidine-tagged yeast odCPO/Hem13p were grown in three different space groups. One of these crystal forms is a truncated protein that underwent limited proteolysis during crystallization to yield a protein that started at Asp6, as indicated by N-terminal sequencing of protein from a washed crystal. SDS-PAGE analysis gave a molecular mass of ∼30 kDa, suggesting that protein in these crystals was also cleaved at the C terminus to remove the last ∼60-70 residues. We refer to these crystals as form C (cleaved). Protein from the other two crystal forms (forms I and II) migrated similarly to full-length odCPO/Hem13p on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. N-terminal sequencing indicated that form I crystals were processed at the N terminus to start at Ala3. This analysis was not performed on form II crystals. We were unable to prepare crystals of selenomethionine-substituted odCPO/Hem13p that diffracted with sufficient strength to allow reliable phase determination. Structure determination was therefore approached using intrinsic anomalous scattering from the eight sulfur atoms in the truncated molecule of form C crystals. This crystal form offered the advantage of a relatively high fraction of sulfur atoms. Data were collected using a rotating anode generator fitted with a chromium anode, appropriate optics, and a helium x-ray path (22Yang C. Pflugrath J.W. Courville D.A. Stence C.N. Ferrara J.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1943-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The single wavelength anomalous diffraction/solvent-flattened map (Fig. 2) was of sufficient clarity to allow building of an initial model that was subsequently refined to an R factor/Rfree of 22.8/23.1% using 1.9-Å data collected from another form C crystal at a synchrotron (Table I). This refined model starts at Arg8 and ends at Arg265. A total of 219 ordered residues are included in the model, and three flexible loops and the 63 C-terminal residues have been omitted; the ordered residues are Arg8-Ala41, Gly51-Lys91, Asp107-Lys191, and Gly207-Arg265. The anomalous scattering of sulfur atoms was used in the classic structure determination of crambin (29Henderickson W. Teeter M. Nature. 1981; 290: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Since then, sulfur anomalous scattering has contributed to a number of structure determinations (30Ramagopal U.A. Dauter M. Dauter Z. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), although only a few of the new structures have resulted from sulfur anomalous scattering data collected on a rotating anode source rather than at a synchrotron (31Debreczeni J.E. Bunkoczi G. Girmann B. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 393-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 32Debreczeni J.E. Girmann B. Zeeck A. Kratzner R. Sheldrick G.M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 2125-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 33Olsen J.G. Flensburg C. Olsen O. Seibold M. Bricogne G. Henriksen A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The primary limitation of this approach is the small anomalous signal obtained from sulfur with conventional copper anode targets. In view of this, it has been suggested that use of a chromium anode, which more than doubles the f ″ of sulfur, might allow a general approach to crystal structure determination without the need to prepare heavy atom derivatives, modified protein, or synchrotron radiation (22Yang C. Pflugrath J.W. Courville D.A. Stence C.N. Ferrara J.D. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2003; 59: 1943-1957Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a new protein structure determined using sulfur anomalous scattering data collected on a chromium target rotating anode generator. Our experience shows that this approach can work well for a 30-kDa protein that contains eight ordered sulfur atoms and diffracts to 2.5-Å resolution on a rotating anode source. The structures of form I and II crystals, both of which contain the full-length protein, were subsequently determined using molecular replacement starting with the form C structure. These models were refined at resolutions of 2.0 Å (form I) and 2.4 Å (form II). The R factors/Rfree values are 20.7/25.4% (form I) and 20.8/28.2% (form II), and the other statistics also indicate that the models have been refined appropriately (Table I). Structure Description—The crystallographic refinements resulted in models for the form I and II structures that start from the first ordered residue (Pro4 (form I) and Ala3 (form II)) and extend to the C terminus. odCPO/Hem13p forms a seven-stranded antiparallel β-sheet that is relatively flat and is covered on both sides by helices (Fig. 3). This structure is essentially identical in all of the crystal forms. Consequently, the form C structure will not be discussed further because, although this form was important for structure determination of the full-length protein, it lacks more than half of the residues that are visible in the form I and II crystals and does not form the physiologically relevant dimer (discussed below). The two monomers in form I crystals overlap with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d.) of 0.6 Å on all pairs of Cα atoms, and the six monomers in form II crystals overlap on each other with r.m.s.d. of 0.7-1.0 Å over all Cα atoms. Form I and II monomers overlap with a r.m.s.d. of ∼1.5 Å on all pairs of Cα atoms except those before Arg13 and between Gln77 and Lys110, inclusive. The 12 N-terminal residues project in very different directions in the two crystal forms, apparently because of different lattice constraints. The Gln77-Lys110 loop appears to move significantly between the two crystal forms, in part because, as discussed below, helix H2 serves as a lid that moves to cover the active-site cavity in the form II structure. odCPO/Hem13p crystallizes as a dimer in which the β-sheets face each other and project above their surrounding helices (Fig. 4). This is consistent with multiple reports that the enzyme is dimeric in solution (3Zagorec M. Buhler J.M. Treich I. Keng T. Guarente L. Labbe-Bois R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9718-9724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Breckau D. Mahlitz E. Sauerwald A. Layer G. Jahn D. J. Biol.

Methods Enzymol. 1997; 281: 367-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The dimeric interface buries a total of 2638 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area and includes 11 direct hydrogen bonding interactions between protein atoms. There are also five water molecules buried at the interface, although most of the contact surface is hydrophobic. The 28 residues that lose accessible surface area upon dimerization are derived from helices H5, H7, H8, and H9; strands S1, S2, S3, and S8; and connecting segments. At the center of the interface, strand S8 forms an antiparallel β-ladder with its 2-fold related partner. The relevance of the crystallographic dimer is indicated by its extensive surface area, the location of conserved residues at the interface (Fig. 4C), and the observation that the same dimer is formed by the two monomers in the form I asymmetric unit and the six monomers in the asymmetric unit of form II crystals. The dimeric arrangement appears to be important for structure at the active site since many residues that stabilize dimer formation are close to residues that line the active-site cleft, and failure to dimerize would likely destabilize the active-site conformation. Active-site Cleft/Cavity—The odCPO sequences have been highly conserved throughout evolution; 76 of the residues (23%) are invariant between 10 highly diverged species that range from cyanobacteria to man (Fig. 3B). The invariant residues are mostly buried in the hydrophobic core or at the dimer interface, whereas the surface-exposed invariant side chains are primarily centered about a deep cleft of the form I crystal structure that appears to house the enzyme active site (Fig. 5). The cleft is sandwiched between one face of the β-sheet (strands S3-S7) and helices H7-H9. These secondary structural elements pack against each other at the base of the cleft. Residues from helix H4 also contribute to the base and to one side of the cleft, and helix H2 is positioned above the cleft in the form I structure, rather like a raised lid. Remarkably, the active-site cleft is not open to bulk solvent in the form II crystal structure (Fig. 5B). Instead, the top of the cleft has been closed by helix H2, for which equivalent Cα atoms move by 6-9 Å between form I and II structures (Fig. 5D). Helix H8 also moves by ∼4 Å, and these two helices pack tightly against each other in the form II conformation to close the active-site cleft. As a consequence of this conformational change, the form II active site is completely sequestered from bulk solvent and encloses a cavity that approximates the size and shape expected for the substrate molecule. The 30 residues that expose accessible surface area to the cavity are indicated with green dots in Fig. 3B, and the importance of the cavity for enzymatic function is further supported by the observation that 18 of these residues are invariant. The completely buried active site explains why substitutions throughout the tetrapyrrole macrocycle limit catalytic turnover (35Lash T.D. Kaprak T.A. Shen L. Jones M.A. Bioorg. Med. Chem.

Previously a Lig4 peptide was reported to be an in vitro substrate for DNA-PK, but the phosphorylation state of Lig4 protein in vivo is not known. In this study, we report that a full-length Lig4 construct was expressed as a phosphoprotein in the cell. Also the full-length Lig4 protein, in complex with XRCC4, was an in vitro substrate for DNA-PK. Using tandem mass spectrometry, we identified a DNA-PK phosphorylation site at Thr-650 in human Lig4 and a potential second phosphorylation site at Ser-668 or Ser-672. Phosphorylation of Lig4 per se was not required for Lig4 DNA end joining activity. Substitution of these amino acids with alanine, individually or in combination, led to changes in Lig4 protein stability of mouse Lig4. The phosphomimetic mutation S650D returned Lig4 stability to that of the wild-type protein. Furthermore DNA-PK was found to negatively regulate Lig4 protein stability. Our results suggest that Lig4 stability is regulated by multiple factors, including interaction with XRCC4, phosphorylation status, and possibly Lig4 conformation.

Mice deficient in Ku70, Ku80, XRCC4, or Lig4 also exhibit growth defects, premature senescence, and hypersensitivity to ionizing irradiation. Deficiency of XRCC4 or Lig4 is most severe, resulting in significant neuronal apoptosis and embryonic lethality (7Frank K.M. Sekiguchi J.M. Seidl K.J. Swat W. Rathbun G.A. Cheng H.L. Davidson L.

Deficiency of XRCC4 or Lig4 in mice has been reported to be associated with genomic instability (18Karanjawala Z.E. Grawunder U. Hsieh C.L. Lieber M.R. Curr.

Lig4 contains one ATP-dependent DNA ligase domain at the N-terminal region (28Tomkinson A.E. Mackey Z.B. Mutat. Res. 1998; 407: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) and two BRCA1 C terminus (BRCT) domains at the C-terminal region (29Zhang X. Morera S. Bates P.A. Whitehead P.C. Coffer A.I.

The BRCT domain is often implicated in protein-protein interactions and is found predominantly in proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoint functions responsive to DNA damage. The BRCT domains of some proteins have been identified as phosphopeptide binding motifs (30Rodriguez M. Yu X. Chen J. Songyang Z. J. Biol.

Hesse J.E. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). XRCC4 also has intrinsic DNA binding activity and may target Lig4 specifically to sites of double strand breaks in a manner that depends on functional DNA-PK (38Modesti M. Hesse J.E. Gellert M.

It is still unclear how XRCC4 enhances Lig4 stability and enzyme activity and how the XRCC4·Lig4·DNA-PK complex is regulated before and after DNA double strand break repair. DNA-PKcs is a serine/threonine kinase in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase family and is believed to be a critical signaling molecule in response to cellular stress. While there are multiple in vitro targets of DNA-PK, very few of these have been proven to be phosphorylated in vivo. The most clearly established in vivo target is DNA-PKcs itself (41Chan D.W.

XRCC4 has been shown to be an effective in vitro substrate for DNA-PK, and there is a DNA-PK-dependent phosphorylation of XRCC4 after DNA damage (4Critchlow S.E. Bowater R.P. Jackson S.P. Curr.

Furthermore, little is known about Lig4 protein modification and regulation. There is one report indicating that a Lig4 fragment is an in vitro substrate for DNA-PK (46Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Here we report that DNA-PK can phosphorylate Lig4 in vitro when present as a complex with XRCC4. The in vitro sites were identified, and a series of mutations of the phosphorylation sites were generated. Our results suggest that DNA-PK may influence Lig4 stability through phosphorylation. Plasmid Constructions—The plasmid pCMV-Tag4-mXRCC4 is a C-terminal FLAG-tagged mouse XRCC4 construct that was derived from an EcoRI-BglII XRCC4 fragment from plasmid pcDNAI-mXRCC4 (8Gao Y. Sun Y. Frank K.M. Dikkes P. Fujiwara Y. Seidl K.J. Sekiguchi J.M. Rathbun G.A. Swat W. Wang J. Bronson R.T. Malynn B.A. Bryans M. Zhu C. Chaudhuri J. Davidson L. Ferrini R. Stamato T. Orkin S.H.

Oligonucleotides synthesized to generate the XRCC4 3′ end of the open reading frame without stop codon (GATCTCTTTGATC and TCGAGATCAAAGA) were subcloned along with the fragment into pCMV-Tag4A vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The plasmid pcDNA3.1-hXRCC4 is a C-terminal His-tagged human XRCC4 construct derived from plasmid pBMM42 XbaI-XhoI fragment (38Modesti M. Hesse J.E. Gellert M.

The plasmid pCMV-Tag2-mLig4 is an N-terminal FLAG-tagged mouse Lig4 construct that was derived from plasmid pcDNA3-mLig4 NheI-XhoI Lig4 coding fragment (7Frank K.M. Sekiguchi J.M. Seidl K.J. Swat W. Rathbun G.A. Cheng H.L. Davidson L. Kangaloo L. Alt F.W.

Lig4 mutants were generated by PCR from expression construct pCMV-Tag2-mLig4. All PCRs were carried out with Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. PCR was performed for each designed mutation with the primers 5′-mLig4 (d(TTCTGGATCCAATGGCTTCCTCACAAACTTCAC)) and 3′-T7 (d(TAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCG)) and the following specific set of primers: S650A-N, d(GTTTACGTTAGCAAGGTTGGGTGCTTTTAAGTG); S650A-C, d(CCCAACCTTGCTAACGTAAACAAAGTTTCCAATG); S668A-N, d(ATCTAATCCAGCCATAACACAAAACTCAACATC); S668-A-C, d(GTTATGGCTGGATTAGATGGTTATCCAAAG); S650D-N, d(GTTTACGTTATCAAGGTTGGGTGCTTTTAAGTG); S650D-C, d(CCCAACCTTGATAACGTAAACAAAGTTTCCAATG); S668D-N, d(ATCTAATCCATCCATAACACAAAACTCAACATC); S668D-C, d(GTTATGGATGGATTAGATGGTTATCCAAAG). All single mutants were generated by performing two-step PCR. Multiple mutants of mLig4 were generated using the plasmid DNA of the single mutants as the template. The murine DNA-PKcs construct pME-PK7 (47Fukumura R. Araki R. Fujimori A. Mori M. Saito T. Watanabe F. Sarashi M. Itsukaichi H. Eguchi-Kasai K. Sato K. Tatsumi K. Abe M. J. Biol.

Antibodies—The following antibodies were used: anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), rabbit anti-XRCC4 (AHP387, Serotec, Raleigh, NC), and anti-DNA-PKcs (clone 18-2, Kamiya Biomedical Company, Seattle, WA). Cell Lines—The hamster cell lines CHO-K1, V3, and XR-1 (48Jeggo P.A. Kemp L.M. Mutat. Res. 1983; 112: 313-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 49Stamato T.D. Weinstein R. Giaccia A.

Metabolic Labeling—Cells were transfected with SuperFect according to the manufacturer's conditions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After 48–72 h, cells were washed in phosphate-free minimal essential Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum and then labeled with 0.3 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 37 °C. The cells were lysed in Tris lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed six times with Tris lysis buffer, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Billerica, MA), and visualized by autoradiography and then Western blot. In Vitro Kinase Assay—Typically 0.5 μg of purified human His-tagged Lig4/untagged XRCC4 proteins were incubated with 50 units of DNA-PK (Promega, Madison, WI) with or without 0.1 μg of linearized pBluescript plasmid DNA (Stratagene) in a total volume of 50 μl of DNA-PK reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1mm dithiothreitol) with or without 10 mm MnCl2. The proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (51Modesti M. Junop M.S. Ghirlando R. van de Rakt M. Gellert M. Yang W. Kanaar R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The mixtures were incubated with 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h at 30 °C and then purified by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen). Samples were loaded onto SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were stained with Coomassie R-250, dried, and then exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. Alternatively cells transfected with FLAG-Lig4 and XRCC4 in 10-cm2 dishes were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (25 mm HEPES, 10 mm MgCl2, 300 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with proteinase inhibitors) and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose. The immunoprecipitates were incubated with DNA-PK. In some cases, wortmannin was included at a final concentration of 10 μm. Identification of Phosphorylation Sites—In vitro phosphorylated Lig4 and XRCC4 bands were excised, subjected to trypsin digestion, and sequenced by microcapillary reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a Finnigan LCQ DECA XP Plus quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. Tandem mass spectra were acquired with a relative collision energy of 30% and an isolation width of 2.5 Daltons. Interpretation of the resulting tandem mass spectra of the peptides was facilitated with the algorithm SEQUEST and programs developed in the Harvard Microchemistry and Proteomics Facility and then confirmed by manual inspection. DNA Ligase Assay—The assay was performed as described in Ref. 38Modesti M. Hesse J.E. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2008-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar with minor modifications. The cohesive end ligation assay substrate was prepared by digestion of plasmid pCMV-Tag2A (Stratagene) with EcoRI. The resulting linear product was purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Assays were performed with 100 ng of substrate in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 300 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2,10mm MnCl2, 0.5 μg of purified His-tagged Lig4/untagged XRCC4; with or without 50 units of DNA-PK; with or without 10 μm wortmannin; and with 10% polyethylene glycol 8000 in a 20-μl final volume. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, stopped by addition of 2 μl of 0.1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, and then treated with proteinase K for 10 min at 37 °C. The samples were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis in Tris borate/EDTA buffer and stained with ethidium bromide. Lig4 Adenylation Assay—XR-1 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged Lig4 and FLAG-tagged XRCC4, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Adenylation assays were performed as described in Ref. 5Grawunder U. Wilm M. Wu X. Kulesza P. Wilson T.E. Mann M. Lieber M.R. Nature. 1997; 388: 492-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar. V(D)J Recombination Assays—Transient V(D)J recombination assays were performed as described in Ref. 6Grawunder U. Zimmer D. Fugmann S. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 477-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar with minor modifications. In brief, 1 μg of recombination substrate plasmid pGG51 (52Gauss G.H. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3900-3906Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and 1 μg of XRCC4 and Lig4 expression plasmids were transfected into 5 × 106 Nalm6 or N114 cells with a BTX electroporator (Harvard Apparatus, Inc., Holliston, MA). Electroporation procedures involved electroporating cells in 0.4-cm cuvettes at 315 V with 10-ms pulse length at room temperature. After transfection and a 48-h incubation, plasmids were recovered by alkaline lysis, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and digested with DpnI. After a second extraction with phenol/chloroform, the DNA was then transformed into E. coli, and the resulting samples were assayed in parallel on ampicillin-chloramphenicol and ampicillin plates. Immunoprecipitation—For Fig. 2A, XR-1 cells in a 10-cm2 dish were harvested in Tris lysis buffer with ethidium bromide (100 μg/ml ethidium bromide, 2% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with mouse IgG for 1 h. Next 30 μl of protein A-agarose were added for another 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. After preclearing, samples were centrifuged, and 30 μl of anti-FLAG M2-agarose were added to the supernatant followed by incubation for 2 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed six times with Tris lysis buffer, one time with phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were then separated by 7% SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore), and visualized by Western blot. For Fig. 7, cell extraction and immunoprecipitation were performed as described above except that no ethidium bromide was added in the lysis buffer. To detect XRCC4 without the interference of Ig heavy chain derived from immunoprecipitation, competition blocking with mouse IgG at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml was performed at the secondary antibody step. Half-life Measurements—Half-life measurements were performed with cycloheximide at the final concentration of 50 μg/ml for a period of time as indicated. Densitometry analysis was performed by using a UMAX scanner (UMAX Technologies, Inc., Dallas, TX) and GelExpert software (NucleoTech, Westport, CT). Lig4 Is a Phosphoprotein and Potential in Vivo Target of DNA-PK—To determine whether Lig4 is a phosphoprotein, we co-transfected Lig4 and XRCC4 into the XRCC4-deficient XR-1 cell line and then labeled cells with [32P]orthophosphate. As can be seen in Fig. 1A, both Lig4 and XRCC4 were phosphorylated. The XRCC4 phosphorylation signal was much stronger than the Lig4 signal. A Lig4 fragment had been reported to be an in vitro substrate for DNA-PK (46Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Kastan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), so we next asked whether DNA-PK is the kinase responsible for Lig4 phosphorylation. We examined Lig4 phosphorylation in wild-type CHO-K1 cells and DNA-PK-deficient V3 cells. FLAG-tagged mouse Lig4 was transiently transfected along with FLAG-tagged mouse XRCC4. The cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate. Next the proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody followed by autoradiography and then Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1B, XRCC4 phosphorylation was detected in both types of cells. However, Lig4 phosphorylation was only detected in the DNA-PK wild-type CHO-K1 cells, not in the DNA-PK-deficient V3 cells. These data suggest that DNA-PK is required for Lig4 phosphorylation. We next determined whether the endogenous DNA-PK formed a complex with the XRCC4·Lig4 proteins expressed from the constructs that were used in the transfection, which is the prerequisite for DNA-PK phosphorylation. After transfection of mouse FLAG-tagged Lig4 and XRCC4 constructs into the XRCC4-deficient XR-1 cells, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and Western blots were performed to examine for the presence of DNA-PKcs. As shown in Fig. 2, when either XRCC4 or Lig4 was transfected alone, no visible DNA-PKcs was pulled down. However, when XRCC4 and Lig4 were transfected together, Lig4 expression increased significantly, and DNA-PKcs was detected. This result indicates that the presence of Lig4 could facilitate DNA-PKcs contact with the Lig4·XRCC4 complex. The DNA-PKcs antibody can react with intact DNA-PKcs as well as its degradation products (13Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), explaining the multiple bands seen in our DNA-PK blots. To further examine DNA-PK phosphorylation of the full-length Lig4 protein, we performed an in vitro kinase assay. Human Lig4 and XRCC4 were expressed in E. coli and purified as described previously (51Modesti M. Junop M.S. Ghirlando R. van de Rakt M. Gellert M. Yang W. Kanaar R. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 334: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The purified human Lig4·XRCC4 complex was incubated with purified DNA-PK, with Mg2+, in the presence or absence of DNA, and with or without Mn2+.As shown in Fig. 3A, Lig4 was most obviously phosphorylated in the presence of Mn2+ and DNA. In the absence of DNA, the Lig4 phosphorylation signal was very faint and almost indiscernible from background. As an additional analysis, the mouse FLAG-tagged XRCC4·Lig4 complex was immunoprecipitated from V3 cells after transient transfection and then phosphorylated in vitro by adding DNA-PK. As shown in Fig. 3B, the FLAG-tagged mouse Lig4 could still be phosphorylated by DNA-PK, and this phosphorylation was inhibited by wortmannin, a specific inhibitor of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase family member"

Here we use ratiometric pH indicator dye to analyze intracellular pH in OLs in culture. The results reveal alkaline microdomains, which predominate in the perikaryon and proximal dendrites, and acidic microdomains, which predominate in distal dendrites. Spatial nonuniformity of pH is generated by differential subcellular distribution of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), which is localized in a punctate distribution in the perikaryon and proximal processes, Na+/HCO3− cotransporter (NBC), which is localized in a punctate distribution in distal dendrites, and carbonic anhydrase isotype II (CAII), which is colocalized with either NHE or NBC. Inhibition of NHE activity by amiloride inhibits regeneration of alkaline microdomains after cytoplasmic acidification, whereas the inhibition of CAII activity with ethoxyzolamide inhibits acidification of dendrites. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy analysis of CAII microinjected into OLs reveals freely diffusing protein throughout the cell as well as protein associated predominantly with NHE in the perikaryon and predominantly with NBC in the dendrites. Alkaline and acidic microdomains could be generated by transport metabolons consisting of CAII associated with NHE or NBC, respectively. This study provides the first evidence for pH microdomains in cells and describes a mechanism for how they are generated.

Spatial nonuniformity of pH is generated by differential subcellular distribution of Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), which is localized in a punctate distribution in the perikaryon and proximal processes, Na+/HCO3− cotransporter (NBC), which is localized in a punctate distribution in distal dendrites, and carbonic anhydrase isotype II (CAII), which is colocalized with either NHE or NBC. Inhibition of NHE activity by amiloride inhibits regeneration of alkaline microdomains after cytoplasmic acidification, whereas the inhibition of CAII activity with ethoxyzolamide inhibits acidification of dendrites. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy analysis of CAII microinjected into OLs reveals freely diffusing protein throughout the cell as well as protein associated predominantly with NHE in the perikaryon and predominantly with NBC in the dendrites. Alkaline and acidic microdomains could be generated by transport metabolons consisting of CAII associated with NHE or NBC, respectively. This study provides the first evidence for pH microdomains in cells and describes a mechanism for how they are generated. Intracellular pH is an important modulator of cell function. Many enzymes exhibit pH dependence in the physiological range such that their activities are affected by small variations in intracellular pH. Until recently, intracellular pH was assumed to be spatially uniform because of fast diffusion of H+ ions and buffers. However, recent studies on cytoplasmic pH in epithelial cells, enterocytes, and myocytes indicate that H+ ions diffuse much more slowly in cytoplasm than in buffer (1Stewart A.K. Boyd C.A. Vaughan-Jones R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Joseph D. Tirmizi O. Zhang X.L. Crandall E.D. Lubman R.L. Am. J.

Physiol. 2002; 541: 139-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), which means that localized generation or depletion of H+ ions within the cell can result in spatial nonuniformity of intracellular pH. This could cause intracellular variations in activities of pH-sensitive enzymes.Oligodendrocytes (OLs) 1The abbreviations used are: OL, oligodendrocyte; CA, carbonic anhydrase; CAII, carbonic anhydrase II; CNS, central nervous system; FCS, fluorescent correlation spectroscopy; NHE, sodium hydrogen exchanger; NBC, sodium bicarbonate cotransporter; SNAFL, seminaphthofluorescein; DiI, dialkylindocarbocyanine.1The abbreviations used are: OL, oligodendrocyte; CA, carbonic anhydrase; CAII, carbonic anhydrase II; CNS, central nervous system; FCS, fluorescent correlation spectroscopy; NHE, sodium hydrogen exchanger; NBC, sodium bicarbonate cotransporter; SNAFL, seminaphthofluorescein; DiI, dialkylindocarbocyanine. are glial cells that make spiral myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS. The large, flat, extended morphology of OLs in culture facilitates visualization of spatial nonuniformity of intracellular pH. In mature OLs, intracellular pH is predominantly determined by activities of three proteins: amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE), ethoxyzolamide-sensitive carbonic anhydrase isotype II (CAII), and stilbene-insensitive Na+/HCO3− cotransporter (NBC) (4Boussouf A. Lambert R.C. Gaillard S. Glia. 1997; 19: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Boussouf A. Gaillard S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A diisothiocyanatostilbene disulfonic acid-sensitive Cl−/HCO3− exchanger found in oligodendrocyte precursor cells is not present in mature oligodendrocytes (5Boussouf A. Gaillard S. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 59: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Plasmalemmal NHE exchanges extracellular Na+ for intracellular H+ at 1:1 stoichiometry, depleting the cell of H+, thereby causing cellular alkalinization (6Yun C.H. Tse C.M. Nath S.K. Levine S.A. Brant S.R. Donowitz M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: G1-G11Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 7Noel J. Germain D. Vadnais J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 15361-15368Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Of the seven NHE isoforms, NHE1 appears to be the predominant form responsible for pH homeostasis in the CNS. Nonuniform distribution of NHE has been observed between the apical and basolateral membranes of proximal tubule epithelial cells (8Ives H.E. Yee V.J. Warnock D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13513-13516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the subcellular distribution of NHE in OLs has not been reported. In bicarbonate-free buffer, pHi recovery following an acid load requires external Na+ and is inhibited by the NHE inhibitor amiloride, indicating that under these conditions NHE is required for cellular alkalinization. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) catalyzes the conversion of CO2 and H2O into HCO3− and H+. Among 14 different CA isozymes, carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) is the predominant isozyme found in the brain, where it is concentrated in the myelin compartment of OLs (9Cammer W. Zhang H. Tansey F.A.

Gaillard S. Glia. 1997; 19: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several NBC isoforms are expressed in mammalian CNS. A characteristic acidic cluster of amino acids (DNDD) in the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of NBC mediates association with the basic N-terminal region of CAII, creating a functional complex or “transport metabolon” to facilitate HCO3− export from the cell (13Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A. Casey J.R. J. Pancreas. 2001; 2: 165-170Google Scholar, 14Sterling D. Reithmeier R.A. Casey J.R. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2002; 283: C1522-C1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Similar acidic regions in the cytoplasmic C-terminal region of NHE may also mediate interaction with CAII, creating a transport metabolon to facilitate H+ export, particularly under acidic conditions (17Li X. Alvarez B. Casey J.R. Reithmeier R.A. Fliegel L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36085-36091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar).Here we show that OLs in culture contain spatially restricted regions of alkaline and acidic pH (pH microdomains) generated by differential subcellular distribution and colocalization of NHE, NBC, and CAII in transport metabolons. Alkaline microdomains predominate in the perikaryon and acidic microdomains predominate in the dendrites. This may provide a mechanism for differential regulation of pH-sensitive enzyme activities in different subcellular compartments.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells and Reagents—Mouse or rat oligodendrocytes were isolated from mixed primary brain cell cultures and grown as previously described (18Ainger K. Avossa D. Diana A.S. Barry C. Barbarese E. Carson J.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). SNAFL-calcein acetoxymethyl ester, nigericin, N-isopropyl-N-methylamiloride hydrochloride, BODIPY FL amiloride, DiI, Texas Red dextran, Alexa Fluor monoclonal antibody labeling kit, and Alexa-labeled secondary antibodies were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Texas Red-conjugated and fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). Ethoxyzolamide and CAII protein from bovine erythrocytes were obtained from Sigma. Rabbit anti-CAII antibody was provided by Dr. Wendy Cammer (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY) or obtained from Chemicon (Pittsburgh, PA). Rabbit antibody raised against peptide 990-1035 of the rat kidney form of NBC-1 was purchased from Chemicon. Mouse monoclonal antibody against peptide 682-801 of rat NHE-1 isoform was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Mississauga, Canada). Protein A-agarose beads and polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were from Bio-Rad. Enhanced chemiluminescence was from Pierce. Protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin) were obtained from Sigma.Measurement of Intracellular pH—Intracellular pH was measured using cell-permeant SNAFL-calcein acetoxymethyl ester, a pH indicator with dual excitation maxima at 490/540 nm and dual emission maxima at 535/625 nm. The ratio of emission intensities at 625/535 nm for SNAFL-calcein is pH-dependent, increasing as pH increases from 6.4 to 7.6. To measure pHi in a single cell, OLs were loaded with 10 μm SNAFL-calcein acetoxymethyl ester for 30-40 min at room temperature in HEPES-buffered solution (25 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2·6H2O, 1.8 mm CaCl2, and 5.5 mm glucose, pH 7.3). After dye loading, the cells were rinsed twice to wash out unloaded dye and incubated for 15-20 min in HEPES buffer (pH 7.3). For calibration, KCl was substituted for NaCl in HEPES buffer, and pH was adjusted with KOH to 6.4, 6.7, 7.0, 7.3, and 7.6. Calibration measurements were done with dye-loaded cells treated with nigericin (a K+/H+ ionophore) to make cells permeable to H+ in solutions at five different pH values (19Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar, 20Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C844-C856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using appropriate discriminatory filters, dual channel images were collected on Zeiss LSM 410 with a 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Zeiss). Ratiometric images of 625/535 nm were generated for >5 cells at each pH, and the average ratio of intensities was calculated for each pH value. These intensity ratio values were used to generate a pH calibration curve for each experiment. The pHi values in OLs were determined by converting the intensity ratio values at each pixel to the corresponding pH value based on the calibration curve. The resulting ratiometric image was displayed in pseudocolor.Inhibitors—To examine the effects of NHE inhibitor on pHi, OLs were permeabilized with nigericin (10 μm) for 3-5 min and acidified in high K+ HEPES buffer (pH 6.4). The cells were then equilibrated in HEPES-buffered solution at pH 7.3 for 10 min in the presence or absence of the NHE inhibitor, N-isopropyl-N-methylamiloride hydrochloride (15 μm) to measure pHi recovery. To examine the effects of carbonic anhydrase inhibitor on pHi, OLs were treated with ethoxyzolamide (200 nm) for 5 min before imaging intracellular pH.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Oligodendrocytes from four 100-mm plates were lysed in 450 μl of buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40), containing a mixture of protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. Lysate was centrifuged (14,000 × g, 4 °C, 30 min). The supernatant was first precleared with 50 μl of washed Protein A-agarose beads by rocking at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then spun down, and the supernatant was split. For Western blotting, aliquots (10 μl) of total lysate were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and were immunoblotted by anti-CAII antibody, anti-NBC antibody, or anti-NHE1 antibody. Positive controls were 0.5 ng of CAII protein or rat brain microsomes. For co-immunoprecipitation, supernatants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 10 μg of rabbit anti-CAII polyclonal antibodies or 2 μl of rabbit preimmune serum as a control. Protein A-agarose beads were then added and allowed to rock for 1.5 h. The beads were washed four times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer and then boiled for 8 min in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 8% polyacrylamide gels and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking the membrane with the TBS-T (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6) containing 5% nonfat milk, Western blotting was performed with mouse anti-NHE monoclonal or rabbit anti-CAII polyclonal primary antibodies, followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence.Cell Staining, Confocal Microscopy, and Ratiometric Image Analysis—BODIPY-labeled amiloride (2 μm) and DiI (15 μg/ml) were used to label NHE and the cell membrane, respectively, in live cells. Rabbit anti-CAII antibody was used to stain CA in fixed cells. Texas Redconjugated dextran (Mr < 10,000), which diffuses uniformly throughout the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm and thus serves as a cytoplasmic volume marker to normalize CAII concentrations in different regions, was microinjected into the cells prior to fixation. The NBC was stained using rabbit anti-NBC antibody and Alexa 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Dual channel images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope with a 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective with appropriate discriminatory filter sets. Neutral density attenuation was used to ensure that all regions of the image were within the dynamic range of the system. To determine the relative concentrations of NHE, NBC, and CAII in different subcellular compartments, ratios of intensities in the green and red channels (NHE/DiI, CAII/Texas Red dextran, and NBC/DiI) were calculated and displayed in pseudocolor using NIH Image software, version 1.62 (National Institutes of Health).Colocalization Analysis—For CAII·NHE double labeling, rabbit polyclonal anti-CAII and mouse monoclonal anti-NHE primary antibodies were used, followed by Texas Red-labeled donkey anti-rabbit and Alexa 488-labeled donkey anti-mouse secondary antibodies. For CAII·NBC double labeling, CAII protein (100 μg/ml) was labeled with Alexa 647 using an Alexa Fluor monoclonal antibody labeling kit from Molecular Probes. Alexa 647-labeled CAII (10 μg/ml) was microinjected into the OLs followed by fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde. NBC was stained as above. Dual channel images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope with a 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective with appropriate discriminatory filter sets. To analyze individual puncta, uniform staining was subtracted in both green and red channels using Photoshop (Adobe). Several hundred individual, well resolved puncta were selected in both channels, and the intensities of CAII and NHE or NBC associated with each punctum were measured as described previously (21King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Patel-King R.S. Carson J.H. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19358-19366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and plotted in a scatter diagram.Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy Analysis—To measure intracellular concentrations and diffusion times for CAII in OLs, CAII protein was fluorescently labeled with Alexa 647, using the Alexa Fluor monoclonal antibody labeling kit from Molecular Probes, and microinjected into OLs. The fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) observation volume was positioned in either the perikaryon or dendrites. In our FCS system (Zeiss Confocor II), confocal optics is used to define the observation volume (<1 fl) illuminated by a stationary laser beam. Fluorescence fluctuation within the observation volume is detected using low noise avalanche photodiode detectors with single photon sensitivity. Photons in the observation volume were recorded over 5 s, and the measurement was repeated five times at each position in the cell. The dynamic properties of CAII molecules at each subcellular location were analyzed by applying the autocorrelation method to the entire fluctuation record (22Magde D. Elson E. Webb W.W. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1972; 29: 705-708Crossref Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). The autocorrelation function is calculated by comparing the fluorescence intensity at time t to the intensity at time t + τ. The autocorrelation function for each measurement was computed using Zeiss Confocor software. Autocorrelation curves with significant photobleaching were discarded, and the remaining curves for each subcellular location were averaged. The averaged autocorrelation curves were globally fit into the theoretical autocorrelation function for three-dimensional diffusion.G(t)=(1+ytripexp(−t/τtrip)1−ytrip)1N∑i=1CNyi(1+tτi)1+ω2tτi(Eq. 1) Where N represents the number of particles, ytrip is triplet state fraction, τtrip is triplet state time, CN is the total number of diffusion components, yi is the fraction of the diffusion component i, τi is diffusion time for component i, and ω is the structural parameter of the observation volume.Manipulation of raw FCS data and nonlinear least squares curve fitting was performed using a system of specialized MATLAB scripts (available upon request). Reciprocals of the S.D. values for each point of the experimental autocorrelation curve were used as weights for fitting.If fluorescent CAII aggregates or binds to other molecules and if aggregation or binding alters its diffusion properties, the fraction bound and fraction unbound can be determined. This provides a measure of the diffusion times and proportions for each component. The proportions of each component were converted to absolute concentrations as follows. The total number of endogenous CAII molecules in the cell (∼10,000 molecules/cell) was determined by quantitative Western blotting (data not shown). The overall concentration of endogenous CAII in the entire cell was estimated based on the total number of molecules per cell and the total volume of the OL (estimated to be ∼1 pl). The volume fraction of the perikaryon and proximal dendrites was estimated to be approximately equal to the volume fraction of the distal dendrites based on their relative areas and the estimated average thickness of cytoplasm in the two compartments. The average relative concentration of CAII in the perikaryon and proximal dendrites was approximately half that in the distal dendrites, based on quantitative immunofluorescence. This allows estimation of the average absolute concentration of endogenous CAII in the perikaryon and proximal dendrites and in the distal dendrites. Fitting the FCS autocorrelation data provides a measure of the relative proportions of microinjected fluorescent CAII with different autocorrelation times. Assuming that FCS autocorrelations times for exogenous fluorescent CAII reflect the distribution of endogenous unlabeled CAII, the absolute concentrations of each component in each subcellular compartment can be estimated.RESULTSpH Microdomains in OLs—OLs were incubated with ratiometric pH indicator dye (seminaphthofluorescein (SNAFL)-calcein acetoxymethyl ester) in bicarbonate-free HEPES buffer (pH 7.3). Following dye loading, dual channel confocal images were collected and converted to ratiometric images to visualize pHi. Calibration was performed with cells permeabilized with nigericin (a K+/H+ ionophore) in high K+ buffer at five different pH values (pH 6.4, 6.7, 7.0, 7.3, 7.6). Nigericin-treated cells showed a uniform distribution of pH throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 1A shows representative cells at pH 6.4, 6.7, 7.0, 7.3, and 7.6). Ratiometric values were measured in five cells at each pH to generate a calibration curve for intracellular pH (Fig. 1A). Fig. 1B shows a representative dual channel image of an OL. The ratios between the channels are not uniform throughout the cell; some regions appear more reddish and some appear more greenish, indicating spatial nonuniformity of pH. The calibration data from Fig. 1A was used to calculate intracellular pH based on the ratios between the two channels at each position in the cell. Fig. 1C shows a ratiometric image of the cell in Fig. 1B, where intracellular pH is represented in pseudocolor. The perikaryon and some dendrites appear more alkaline (red), whereas other dendrites appear more acidic (blue). Close examination of the image (Fig. 1C, inset) reveals numerous alkaline microdomains (red) and acidic microdomains (blue) scattered throughout the cell in close apposition to the cell membrane. Microdomains are defined as discrete regions (generally ∼1 μm in diameter) with pH values that differ from the surrounding cytoplasm by >0.1 pH unit. In the perikaryon and in some dendrites, alkaline microdomains predominate, making the overall intracellular pH in these regions appear more alkaline. In other dendrites, acidic microdomains predominate, making the overall pH in these regions appear more acidic. Alkaline microdomains may reflect regions of local proton depletion, and acidic microdomains may represent regions of local proton generation. Spatial nonuniformity in the ratiometric image shown in Fig. 1C is interpreted as evidence for nonuniform intracellular pH. The relatively uniform intracellular pH in nigericin-permeabilized cells used for calibration (Fig. 1A) indicates that spatial nonuniformity of pH in intact cells is not due to nonuniform intracellular dye binding, noise in the imaging system, or imaging artifacts.Subcellular Distribution of NHE, CAII, and NBC in OLs— The function of NHE is to export protons from the cytoplasm. Fig. 2A shows that NHE-1 is detected in OLs by Western blotting. To analyze the subcellular distribution of NHE, OLs were incubated with BODIPY-amiloride, which binds to NHE, and with DiI, a lipophilic carbocyanine dye, which labels the plasma membrane uniformly. Ratiometric images displaying NHE intensity divided by DiI intensity at each pixel provide a measure of the relative concentration of NHE at each point on the cell membrane. NHE is concentrated in a punctate distribution in the perikaryon and proximal processes. Each punctum presumably represents a cluster of NHE molecules formed by association of individual NHE molecules within the plane of the membrane. Since the function of NHE is to exchange extracellular Na+ for intracellular H+, punctate distribution of NHE may result in local depletion of H+, which could create alkaline microdomains in the vicinity of the clusters.Fig. 2NHE, CA, and NBC in OLs. A-D provide evidence for NHE in OLs. A shows a Western blot of NHE-1 in OL lysate. The control lane (C) was loaded with lysate from rat liver microsomes. The positions of molecular weight standards are indicated. B-D show the subcellular distribution of NHE-1. OLs were incubated with DiI (15 μg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature to label the cell membrane. BODIPY-labeled amiloride (2 μm) was used to label NHE protein in OLs by incubating for 10 min. The green channel (B) shows amiloride labeling of NHE, and the red channel (C) shows the DiI labeling of the plasma membrane. The single channel images are displayed in inverted grayscale to facilitate visualization of fine processes. The relative concentration of NHE at each pixel was normalized by dividing the intensity in the NHE image by the intensity in the corresponding pixel in the DiI image. The ratiometric image of NHE/DiI (D) is displayed in pseudocolor, where the highest NHE concentration is displayed in red and the lowest in blue. E-H provide evidence for CAII in OLs. E shows Western blotting of CAII in OL lysate. The control lane was loaded with purified CAII. F-H show the subcellular distribution of CAII in OLs. Texas Red-conjugated dextran (Mr <10,000) was microinjected into the cells as a cytoplasmic volume marker, followed by fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde and immunolabeling with rabbit anti-CAII primary antibodies and fluorescein-labeled donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. CAII and cytoplasmic volume were visualized in green (F) and red (G) channels, respectively, and are displayed in inverted grayscale. The intensity of CAII in the green channel was divided by the intensity of Texas Red dextran in the red channel. The ratiometric image (H) of CAII/cytoplasmic volume is displayed in pseudocolor, where the highest CAII concentration is shown in blue and the lowest in red. I-L provide evidence for NBC in OLs. I shows Western blotting of NBC-1 in OL lysate. The control lane was loaded with lysate from rat liver microsomes. J-L show the subcellular distribution of NBC-1 in OLs. Cells were fixed and stained with DiI to label the plasma membrane, and NBC was immunolabeled with rabbit anti-NBC primary antibody and Alexa 488-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody. J and K show the staining of NBC and plasma membrane, respectively, displayed in inverted grayscale. The ratiometric image (L) of NBC/DiI is displayed in pseudocolor, where the highest NBC concentration is shown in blue and the lowest in red. Note that the pseudocolor coding in H and L is inverted relative to D to facilitate visualization of color variations in the distal dendrites.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)CAII reversibly converts H2O and CO2 to H+ and HCO3−. We have determined, by quantitative Western blotting (Fig. 2B), that OLs contain ∼10,000 CAII molecules/cell (data not shown). To analyze the subcellular distribution of CAII, OLs were microinjected with Texas Red-labeled dextran as a cytoplasmic volume marker and then fixed and stained with antibody to CAII. The CAII intensity divided by the Texas Red dextran intensity, displayed as a ratiometric image in pseudocolor, provides an indication of the relative concentration of CAII at each position in the cell. CAII is distributed at low intensity uniformly throughout the cell and at higher intensity in a discrete punctate distribution in the dendrites. Based on the number of puncta and the number of CAII molecules per cell, each punctum represents 10-100 CAII molecules. The overall concentration of CAII is higher in the dendrites than in the perikaryon, with different concentrations in individual processes.NBC is a cotransporter that exports intracellular Na+ and HCO3− from the cell, suggesting that it may play a role in removing HCO3− generated by CAII in the periphery. Fig. 2C shows that NBC-1 is detected in OLs by Western blotting. To examine the distribution of NBC in OLs, cells were incubated with DiI to label the plasma membrane uniformly and then immunostained with antibody to NBC. The ratiometric image of NBC/DiI displaying the intensity of NBC divided by DiI intensity in pseudocolor provides a measure of NBC concentration at each position on the membrane. NBC appears to be localized in a punctate distribution in most dendrites. Each punctum presumably represents a cluster of NBC molecules formed by association of individual NBC molecules in the plane of the bilayer. Since the function of NBC is to export intracellular HCO3−, the punctate distribution of NBC may result in local accumulation of H+, which could create acidic microdomains in the vicinity of the clusters.Inhibition of NHE or CAII Affects Intracellular pH in OLs—To determine whether NHE activity regulates intracellular pH, OLs loaded with SNAFL-calcein were acidified by nigericin treatment at pH 6.4, followed by equilibration in buffer at pH 7.3, in the absence or presence of amiloride to inhibit NHE function (Fig. 3, A and B). Amiloride treatment inhibited overall pH recovery and also inhibited regeneration of alkaline microdomains, indicating that NHE contributes to establishing and maintaining alkaline intracellular pH in OLs. Since amiloride is known to inhibit several different sodium/proton antiporter isoforms (23Smart S.C. Locurto A. el Schultz J. Sagar K.B. Warltier D.C. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1995; 26: 1365-1373Cros"
https://openalex.org/W2139210740,"Employing a yeast two-hybrid screen with the COOH terminus of polycystin-2, one of the proteins mutated in patients with polycystic kidney disease, we were able to isolate a novel protein that we call PIGEA-14 (polycystin-2 interactor, Golgi- and endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein with a molecular mass of 14 kDa). Molecular modeling only predicts a coiled-coil motif, but no other functional domains, in PIGEA-14. In a subsequent two-hybrid screen using PIGEA-14 as a bait, we found GM130, a component of the cis-compartment of the Golgi apparatus. Co-expression of the PIGEA-14 and PKD2 cDNAs in LLC-PK1 and HeLa cells resulted in a redistribution of PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2 to the trans-Golgi network, which suggests that PIGEA-14 plays an important role in regulating the intracellular location of polycystin-2 and possibly other intracellular proteins. Our results also indicate that the intracellular trafficking of polycystin-2 is regulated both at the level of the endo-plasmic reticulum and that of the trans-Golgi network.

It encodes polycystin-2, a 968-amino acid protein with six putative transmembrane domains, whose NH2 and COOH termini are predicted to extend into the cytoplasm. Subsequent to the identification of polycystin-2, three related proteins have been found, which are called polycystin-2L, polycystin-2L2, and mucolipin. These four proteins apparently constitute a branch of the large family of Trp (transient receptor potential) proteins, a novel class of cation channels (2Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V.

So far the physiological function of polycystin-2 and the mechanism of cyst formation have remained a mystery (9Gallagher A.R. Hidaka S. Gretz N. Witzgall R. Cell. Mol.

Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Because many mutations in the PKD2 gene are predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein (14Deltas C.C. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 18: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), a possible scenario could be that a mutant protein escapes from the endoplasmic reticulum and reaches the plasma membrane, where it results in the uncontrolled influx of Ca2+ ions. One entry point to a better functional understanding of polycystin-2 lies in the identification of interacting proteins. Polycystin-2 and polycystin-1 have been shown to associate through their respective COOH termini (15Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar, 16Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this report we identify a novel protein with a coiled-coil domain, which is connected both to polycystin-2 and to GM130, a constituent of the Golgi matrix. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—The fragment coding for the COOH terminus of human polycystin-2 (amino acids 680–968) was subcloned into the bait plasmid pPC97 (19Vidal M. Brachmann R.K. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Boeke J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10315-10320Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). MaV103 yeast cells were first transformed with the bait construct and then with a human kidney cDNA library in the prey plasmid pPC86 (Invitrogen). Approximately 4 × 105 transformants were first screened for histidine prototrophy in the presence of 50 mm 3-aminotriazole (Sigma) and subsequently assayed for activation of the URA3 and LacZ genes. A second yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out with PIGEA-14 as a bait and the same human kidney cDNA library as a prey. Generation of Deletion Mutants of PIGEA-14 and Polycystin-2—To define which regions within polycystin-2 and PIGEA-14 were necessary for the respective interactions, a number of deletion mutants were constructed by PCR using Pfu polymerase. All of the constructs were sequenced prior to use to confirm the absence of mutations. Expression Plasmids—The synthesis of a full-length human polycystin-2 protein with an epitope tag from the influenza virus hemagglutinin protein at its COOH terminus was driven by the eukaryotic expression vectors pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and pUHD 10–3 (kind gift from Hermann Bujard). PIGEA-14 was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pEBG, which encodes fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase (kind gift from Tom Force). To generate a construct, in which the COOH terminus of polycystin-2 is located on the extracellular side, the CD8 cDNA was digested with SgrAI (the recognition site for SgrAI site is located in the region encoding the extracellular domain of CD8). The fragment encoding the region beyond the sixth membrane-spanning domain of polycystin-2 was PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides containing recognition sites for AvaI at their 5′-end, cut with AvaI, and inserted into the SgrAI site of CD8. The correct orientation of the insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Transfection Protocols—COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using the DEAE-dextran method (20Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1996: 9.2.1-9.2.10Google Scholar). HtTA-1 (kind gift from Hermann Bujard) and LtTA-2,22 cells (HeLa and LLC-PK1 cells producing a tetracycline-controlled transactivator, respectively) were stably transfected using poly-l-ornithine (21Dong Y. Skoultchi A.I. Pollard J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 771-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and selected with puromycin at a concentration of 1 μg/ml (Calbiochem). To co-express the PIGEA-14 and PKD2 cDNAs, HtTA-1 and LtTA-2,22 cells inducibly producing the HA 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Endo H, endoglycosidase H. epitope-tagged polycystin-2 protein were stably transfected with pEBG/PIGEA-14 using hygromycin at a concentration of 300 μg/ml (Calbiochem). Co-precipitation and Western Blot Experiments—The cells were lysed in 1× PBS, 1% Triton X-100. Swollen glutathione-agarose, protein A-Sepharose, or protein G-agarose beads were incubated with lysate containing 2–3 mg of protein for at least 4 h at 4 °C (for immunoprecipitations, 50 μl of 12CA5, 50 μl of 9E10, 50 μl of OKT8, and 2 μlofthe anti-GM130 antiserum were included as well). The beads were washed with cell lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blot. The mouse monoclonal antibody 12CA5, which is directed against an epitope of the hemagglutinin protein (hybridoma supernatant diluted 1:30), a mouse monoclonal anti-GST antibody (diluted 1:3,000; Sigma), and a sheep polyclonal anti-GM130 antibody (diluted 1:2,000; kind gift from Francis Barr) were used as primary antibodies; horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse and donkey anti-sheep antibodies (diluted 1:10,000; Sigma) served as secondary antibodies. Immunocytochemistry—Transfected cells were cultured on coverslips for at least 2 days. After fixation with Bouin's solution (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 15% saturated picric acid, 2% formaldehyde) for 20 min, the cells were permeabilized in 1× PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 for 45 min and then incubated with the primary antibody (diluted in 1× PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin) for 2 h at room temperature. The following primary antibodies were used: the mouse monoclonal anti-HA epitope antibody 12CA5 (diluted 1:30), a mouse monoclonal anti-GST antibody (diluted 1:1,000; Sigma), a rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibody (diluted 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a rabbit polyclonal antibody against Sec61β, a marker of the endoplasmic reticulum (diluted 1:100; kind gift from Martin Pool and Bernhard Dobberstein), the mouse monoclonal anti-CD8 antibody OKT8 (diluted 1:30; kind gift from Walter Nickel), a sheep polyclonal antibody against GM130 (diluted 1:250; kind gift from Francis Barr), a mouse monoclonal antibody against acetylated tubulin (diluted 1:500; Sigma), and a rabbit polyclonal antibody against TGN46 (diluted 1:250; kind gift from George Banting). After three washes with 1× PBS, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:150; Cappel), Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:300; Dianova), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:200; Cappel), Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (diluted 1:300; Dianova) or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-sheep IgG (diluted 1:40; Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Following the incubation with the secondary antibody, the cells were washed with 1× PBS and mounted in bicarbonate-buffered glycerol, pH 8.6. Pictures were taken with a Zeiss laser confocal scanning microscope and then processed with Adobe Photoshop. Immunogold Electron Microscopy—The cells were grown on Petri dishes and then treated as described above for immunocytochemistry. The primary antibodies used were the mouse monoclonal anti-HA epitope antibody 12CA5 and the mouse monoclonal anti-GST antibody; the secondary antibody (diluted 1:40) was conjugated to 6-nm gold particles (Dianova). Following the incubation with the secondary antibody, the cells were washed with 1× PBS and fixed with 1× PBS, 2% glutaraldehyde. Subsequent to a treatment with osmium, the cells were dehydrated and embedded in Durcupan ACM. Sections of 90 nm thickness were prepared, stained with uranyl acetate, and analyzed by electron microscopy. Cellular Fractionation and Deglycosylation Experiments—Cells grown on Petri dishes were washed twice in 1× PBS and scraped into a microcentrifuge tube. After centrifuging for 5 min at 4,000 rpm, the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 μg/ml of aprotinin) and homogenized with a motor-driven pestle. Post-nuclear supernatants were prepared by centrifugation at 1,000 × g, and then the supernatant was divided into three tubes. One tube was left on ice for 30 min without any treatment, one tube was treated for 30 min with 1.5 m NaCl (final concentration), and one tube was treated with 0.2 m Na2CO3 (final concentration) pH 11.0. These homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C, the supernatants were recovered, and the pellets were washed with the respective buffers before being resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Equal amounts of supernatant and pellet fractions were analyzed by Western blot. When a deglycosylation experiment was to be performed, the membrane pellet was resuspended in denaturation buffer and incubated with Endo H and peptide N-glycosidase F according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Isolation of PIGEA-14 —We used the COOH terminus of human polycystin-2 to perform a two-hybrid screen with a human adult kidney cDNA library. Of ∼400,000 transformants, 28 clones were isolated that grew in the absence of histidine and uracil and also turned blue in a β-galactosidase assay. Eight of those clones turned out to code for a novel protein that we call PIGEA-14 (pronounced “piggy 14”), a 126-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of 14.2 kDa (Fig. 1a). It is highly conserved in various vertebrate species (Fig. 1b) but was not detected in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans. According to information from the human genome project, PIGEA-14 is located on human chromosome 22q12-13. It is organized in five exons, which are delineated by consensus splice donor and acceptor sites (GenBank™ accession number BK005534). The only predicted structural motif is a coiled-coil domain extending from amino acid Val69 to amino acid Ser109 in the human protein (Fig. 1, b and c). No putative membrane-spanning segments were revealed in silico, and indeed only a minor portion of PIGEA-14 was detected in the pellet fraction after subcellular fractionation and subsequent centrifugation at 100,000 × g (Fig. 1d). A deletion mutagenesis analysis showed that the minimal domain necessary for the interaction of PIGEA-14 with polycystin-2 comprised amino acids Ile60–Met112, and therefore the coiled-coil domain of PIGEA-14 (Fig. 2a). A coiled-coil domain has also been found in the COOH terminus of polycystin-2 (amino acids 769–796) and therefore served as an obvious candidate for the interacting counterpart in polycystin-2. The deletion mutant extending from Gly833 to Ser923 represented the minimal domain in polycystin-2 that was still able to interact with PIGEA-14, therefore showing that the coiled-coil domain in polycystin-2 is not necessary for the interaction with PIGEA-14 (Fig. 2b). Because we were worried that the interaction of PIGEA-14 with polycystin-2 was due to the stickiness of its coiled-coil domain, we assayed PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2 against coiled-coil domains from other proteins. When PIGEA-14 was tested against the leucine zipper domains of c-Fos and c-Jun and polycystin-2 was tested against that of c-Jun, no interaction was demonstrated in yeast, thus indicating that the interaction was specific (Fig. 2c). We also assayed PIGEA-14 against the COOH terminus of polycystin-2L, and again no interaction was observed (Fig. 1a). To confirm the interaction in mammalian cell lines, stably transfected LLC-PK1 and HeLa cells were established that inducibly produce a HA epitope-tagged human polycystin-2 protein and constitutively produce a GST/PIGEA-14 fusion protein. Both by immunoprecipitation and in a GST pull-down assay the interaction between polycystin-2 and PIGEA-14 was confirmed (Fig. 2, d and e). PIGEA-14 Affects the Intracellular Distribution of Polycystin-2—Because its primary sequence did not provide any hints on the possible function of PIGEA-14, we performed another two-hybrid screen using PIGEA-14 as a bait. Of 720,000 transformants, 24 clones grew in the absence of histidine and uracil and turned blue in a β-galactosidase assay. Three of those clones represented GM130, a protein associated with the Golgi matrix and two of those clones represented PIGEA-14. Polycystin-2 was not isolated, which may not be too surprising because it is predicted to contain six transmembrane segments and therefore either does not even reach the nucleus or if it does, it is probably unstable or does not fold properly. As in the case of the interaction between PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2, the interaction between PIGEA-14 and GM130 and the self-interaction of PIGEA-14 depended on the presence of the coiled-coil domain of PIGEA-14, although the responsible interaction domains seemed to vary somewhat (Fig. 3a). Again the association between PIGEA-14 and GM130 was confirmed by co-precipitation in mammalian cells (Fig. 3b). The finding that PIGEA-14 interacts with GM130 prompted us to take a closer look at the intracellular distribution of PIGEA-14. Stably transfected HeLa cells were established that inducibly produced polycystin-2 either in the absence or presence of PIGEA-14. In the absence of exogenous PIGEA-14, polycystin-2 was distributed in a reticular pattern in the cytoplasm of most cells as shown before (11Gallagher A.R. Cedzich A. Gretz N. Somlo S. Witzgall R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4017-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), consistent with its location in the endoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 4a), but in a minority of cells we also found a patchy distribution of polycystin-2 (Fig. 4b). Similarly, in the absence of polycystin-2, PIGEA-14 was found in a fine reticular pattern in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4c). After the induction of polycystin-2, however, the distribution of PIGEA-14 and of polycystin-2 changed dramatically to an identical patchy pattern, and upon higher magnification a lumen could be noticed in those “patches” (Fig. 4d), which indicated that they did not represent aggregated protein but rather vesicular organelles. Because we were worried that the redistribution of both proteins was due to the overexpression of the PIGEA-14 and PKD2 cDNAs and not to a specific interaction, we performed several control experiments. In HeLa cells stably producing PIGEA-14 and a truncated polycystin-2 protein lacking the region beyond amino acid 703, PIGEA-14 was still found in a reticular pattern in the cytoplasm, whereas the truncated polycystin-2 protein reached the plasma membrane (Fig. 5a). This strongly argues that the interaction between PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2 and therefore also the redistribution of PIGEA-14 upon the induction of full-length polycystin-2 depended on the COOH terminus of polycystin-2 (because both the full-length and truncated polycystin-2 protein were epitope-tagged, we were able to make sure that they were synthesized at comparable levels). A second set of control experiments was based on the generally accepted assumption that the COOH terminus of polycystin-2 extends into the cytoplasm. Therefore it would be predicted that polycystin-2 would not be able to interact with PIGEA-14 if its COOH terminus would be located on the opposite side of the membrane. If a redistribution was still observed with such a construct, then it probably represented a nonspecific effect from overexpressing two cDNAs. We tested this hypothesis by generating fusion proteins between CD8, an integral membrane protein normally located in the plasma membrane, and the COOH terminus of polycystin-2. In one construct the COOH terminus of polycystin-2 was fused to the intracellular portion of CD8, whereas in the second construct it was inserted into the extracellular portion of CD8. The transient transfection of COS-7 cells with expression plasmids encoding the GST/PIGEA-14 and the CD8/polycystin-2 fusion proteins yielded the following distribution patterns. Similar to what we observed in HeLa cells, the CD8 protein with the COOH terminus of polycystin-2 attached to its intracellular portion was detected in a reticular and patchy distribution (Fig. 5, b and c). However, when the COOH terminus of polycystin-2 was inserted into the extracellular portion of CD8, the fusion protein was clearly detected in the plasma membrane (Fig. 5d). Again very comparable with the situation in HeLa cells, the GST/PIGEA-14 fusion protein was distributed in a reticular fashion in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5e). The co-transfection of the respective expression plasmids only then led to a co-localization of polycystin-2 and PIGEA-14 when the COOH terminus of polycystin-2 was located in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5, f and g). These experiments support the notion that the particular redistribution of both proteins depended on their physical interaction and was not simply a result of overexpressing two cDNAs. To learn what intracellular compartment PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2 were redirected to upon their simultaneous production, we performed double immunocytochemistry experiments with markers for various cytoplasmic organelles. No co-localization was detected with ERGIC-53, a marker for the intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, nor with various markers of the Golgi apparatus such as Golgi 58K protein, mannosidase II, Gal T1, Giantin, and also (somewhat surprisingly) not with GM130. TGN46, however, a marker of the trans-Golgi network, was found to co-localize with PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2 in HeLa cells (Fig. 6, a and b). In HeLa cells not producing exogenous PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2, however, TGN46 was seen in close neighborhood to the nucleus (Fig. 6c), indicating that in cells producing PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2, TGN46 also changed its distribution. We finally extended our findings to LLC-PK1 cells, a highly differentiated porcine kidney epithelial cell line. In LLC-PK1 cells producing either PIGEA-14 or polycystin-2, a reticular distribution was detected for both proteins (data not shown). When PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2 were synthesized together, their distribution changed markedly to a TGN46-positive compartment (Fig. 7, a and b), and again the distribution of TGN46 was altered drastically (Fig. 7, compare b and c). Immunogold electron microscopy demonstrated the intense labeling of vesicular structures near the nucleus (Fig. 7d); sometimes these vesicular structures even appeared to be assembled in a honeycomb-like fashion (Fig. 7e). Because our data suggested that polycystin-2 is increasingly able to escape to the trans-Golgi network in the presence of PIGEA-14, we predicted that its N-linked sugar residues should have been processed and become resistant to Endo H as we have observed for a truncated polycystin-2 protein lacking the COOH terminus (10Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). As a matter of fact, both in the absence and in the presence of PIGEA-14 polycystin-2 was still completely sensitive to Endo H, indicating that its N-linked sugar residues were not processed in the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 7f). Recently, increasing evidence has been accumulated for the role of primary cilia in the pathogenesis of cyst formation, and we therefore asked whether PIGEA-14 is also located in this organelle. We could easily detect primary cilia on the apical surface of LLC-PK1 cells, but neither in the absence nor in the presence of polycystin-2 was PIGEA-14 found there (Fig. 8, a and b).Fig. 8PIGEA-14 is not detected in primary cilia. Double immunocytochemistry of LLC-PK1 cells for PIGEA-14 and acetylated tubulin (a marker for primary cilia) shows that PIGEA-14 is not present in primary cilia either in the absence (a) or in the presence (b) of the HA epitope-tagged polycystin-2 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) There is conflicting evidence on the subcellular location of polycystin-2, one of the two proteins mutated in patients suffering from autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease. One set of experiments argues that full-length polycystin-2 is located exclusively or at least predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (6Koulen P. Cai Y. Geng L. Maeda Y. Nishimura S. Witzgall R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 20763-20773Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), whereas other groups have provided data demonstrating the presence of polycystin-2 in the plasma membrane (3Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar, 13Luo Y. Vassilev P.M. Li X. Kawanabe Y. Zhou J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 2600-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical staining, biotinylation studies, glycosidase sensitivity, and density gradient centrifugations have been used in favor of one or the other argument without leading to a consensus. One reason for such a discrepancy may lie in the fact that the subcellular location of polycystin-2 may very well depend on the biological context, i.e. the cell line and tissue used for a study. An argument for this hypothesis comes from the finding that in the absence of polycystin-1, polycystin-2 was located in the endoplasmic reticulum of Chinese hamster ovary cells, but in its presence polycystin-2 was able to reach the plasma membrane (3Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). In other words, the protein composition of a given cell may determine whether polycystin-2 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum or is able to reach the plasma membrane. A better understanding of the basic mechanisms regulating the subcellular location of polycystin-2 should therefore be very useful to decide whether the endoplasmic reticulum or the plasma membrane is the physiological site of action of polycystin-2 in a given organ or cell. It is generally acknowledged that the COOH terminus of polycystin-2 harbors a retention signal for the endoplasmic reticulum (10Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and because many mutations in the PKD2 gene are predicted to lead to the synthesis of a truncated protein (14Deltas C.C. Hum. Mutat. 2001; 18: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the mislocalization of a mutant polycystin-2 protein and the resulting aberrant calcium currents could be one explanation for the formation of cysts. Our two-hybrid screen using the COOH terminus of polycystin-2 as a bait has led to the identification of PIGEA-14, a novel coiled-coil protein not only interacting with polycystin-2 but also with itself and with GM130. GM130 is a peripheral membrane protein that is associated with the cis-compartment of the Golgi apparatus through its interaction with GRASP65, a myristoylated protein. It probably acts as a docking station for p115, another peripheral membrane protein, which is attached to COPII vesicles through its interaction with Rab1 and to COPI vesicles through its interaction with the integral membrane protein giantin (22Barr F.A. Short B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 23Gillingham A.K. Munro S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1641: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Because many proteins involved in endoplasmic reticulum-to-Golgi trafficking contain coiled-coil motifs (among them p115 and GM130) and because of its particular location and its redistribution upon the induction of polycystin-2, a role for PIGEA-14 in intracellular vesicle trafficking can be easily envisioned. It is also remarkable that polycystin-2L, which does not interact with PIGEA-14, contains no retention signal for the endoplasmic reticulum in its COOH terminus (own observations). Polycystin-2 and polycystin-2L are well conserved in their COOH termini, but the homology breaks down in the region of polycystin-2, which contains the retention signal and which is responsible for the interaction with PIGEA-14. The easiest explanation for the co-localization of PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2 with TGN46 would be that PIGEA-14 and polycystin-2 reach the trans-Golgi network. It is remarkable, however, that the shape of the TGN46-positive compartment changes. This may indicate that none of the three proteins is present in the trans-Golgi network and that TGN46, PIGEA-14, and polycystin-2 have all three been redirected to an altogether different compartment. We were also surprised by the fact that polycystin-2 in the TGN46-positive compartment was still sensitive to a treatment with the glycosidase Endo H, whereas a mutant polycystin-2 protein lacking the COOH terminus is resistant to treatment with Endo H (10Cai Y. Maeda Y. Cedzich A. Torres V.E. Wu G. Hayashi T. Mochizuki T. Park J.H. Witzgall R. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28557-28565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This would argue that the full-length polycystin-2 protein takes a different intracellular route than the mutant protein, which would be predicted to migrate through the Golgi apparatus. If this scenario is true, the interpretation of studies on the intracellular location of full-length polycystin-2 using Endo H sensitivity has to be reconsidered. There obviously remain a number of open questions such as the identity of the interaction motifs in the respective proteins and the identification of the various protein complexes. One also has to wonder why polycystin-2 gets stuck in the TGN46-positive compartment and does not move further to the plasma membrane. It is worth pointing out in this context that the R1394H mutation in the SUR1 subunit of the ATP-sensitive K+ channel leads to the accumulation of the mutant SUR1 protein in the trans-Golgi network (24Partridge C.J. Beech D.J. Sivaprasadarao A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35947-35952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), so obviously there is another checkpoint for the assembly of functional ion channels at this level. We believe that the identification of PI-GEA-14 could be an important first step to a better understanding of the intracellular trafficking of polycystin-2.

https://openalex.org/W2030630765,"Phosphate is an essential nutrient that must be taken up from the growth medium through specific transporters. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, both high and low affinity orthophosphate carriers allow this micro-organism to cope with environmental variations. Intriguingly, in this study we found a tight correlation between selenite resistance and expression of the high affinity orthophosphate carrier Pho84p. Our work further revealed that mutations in the low affinity orthophosphate carrier genes (PHO87, PHO90, and PHO91) cause deregulation of phosphate-repressed genes. Strikingly, the deregulation due to pho87Δ, pho90Δ, or pho91Δ mutations was neither correlated to impaired orthophosphate uptake capacity nor to a decrease of the intracellular orthophosphate or polyphosphate pools, as shown by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Thus, our data clearly establish that the low affinity orthophosphate carriers affect phosphate regulation independently of intracellular orthophosphate concentration through a new signaling pathway that was found to strictly require the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Pho81p. We propose that phosphate-regulated gene expression is under the control of two different regulatory signals as follows: the sensing of internal orthophosphate by a yet unidentified protein and the sensing of external orthophosphate by low affinity orthophosphate transporters; the former would be required to maintain phosphate homeostasis, and the latter would keep the cell informed on the medium phosphate richness.

Phosphate is an essential nutrient required for biosynthesis of several cellular components such as phospholipids or nucleotide derivatives. Therefore, many organisms have developed mechanisms allowing them to adapt phosphate utilization to phosphate availability. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been used extensively as a model to study how eukaryotic cells respond to variations of external orthophosphate concentrations. Yeast cells are able to take up orthophosphate from the external environment through at least five orthophosphate carriers catalyzing orthophosphate accumulation (Fig. 1) as follows: two high affinity permeases (Pho84p and Pho89p (1Persson B.L. Berhe A. Fristedt U. Martinez P. Pattison J. Petersson J. Weinander R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1365: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)) and three low affinity permeases (Pho87p, Pho90p, and Pho91p (2Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Combined deletion of these five genes is lethal, but viability can be rescued by overexpression of the GIT1 gene that encodes a glycerophosphoinositol permease that can also take up orthophosphate (2Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of organic phosphate in the medium, secreted acidic phosphatases (Pho3p, Pho5p, Pho11p, and Pho12p (3Oshima Y. Genes Genet. Syst. 1997; 72: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)) are able to transform it into orthophosphate, which can in turn be transported by the orthophosphate permeases. In response to high external inorganic orthophosphate concentrations, transcription of several genes is repressed (4Ogawa N. DeRisi J. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4309-4321Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 5Boer V.M. de Winde J.H. Pronk J.T. Piper M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3265-3274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Among them are the genes coding for excreted phosphatases (PHO5, PHO11, and PHO12), the high affinity orthophosphate carriers (PHO84 and PHO89), GIT1, and a gene encoding a protein required for correct localization of Pho84p in the plasma membrane, PHO86 (6Lau W.T. Howson R.W. Malkus P. Schekman R. O'Shea E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The other PHO-regulated genes are the PHO81 family members (PHO81, SPL2, and YPL110C) encoding potential cyclin inhibitors and several genes coding for various phosphate metabolism enzymes such as the PHM genes (Fig. 1) that are involved in polyphosphate (polyPi) 1The abbreviation used is: polyPi, inorganic polyphosphate. synthesis or degradation (7Ogawa N. Tzeng C.M. Fraley C.D. Kornberg A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6687-6693Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Differential phosphorylation of the Pho4p transcription factor by the Pho80p-Pho85p cyclin-dependent kinase complex allows transcriptional regulation of the PHO regulon in response to variations of external orthophosphate concentration (8Kaffman A. Herskowitz I. Tjian R. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1153-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). When external concentration of orthophosphate is low, the cyclin-dependent protein kinase inhibitor Pho81p, which is constitutively bound to the Pho80p-Pho85p complex, becomes active resulting in low phosphorylation of Pho4p by the cyclincyclin-dependent protein kinase complex (9Ogawa N. Noguchi K. Sawai H. Yamashita Y. Yompakdee C. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 10Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6695-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This low phosphorylated form of Pho4p has a high affinity for the nuclear importin Pse1p and a low affinity for the nuclear exportin Msn5p and is therefore preferentially located in the nucleus (10Schneider K.R. Smith R.L. O'Shea E.K. Science. 1994; 266: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 12O'Neill E.M. Kaffman A. Jolly E.R. O'Shea E.K.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2673-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), where Pho4p cooperates with Pho2p, another transcription factor (15Hirst K. Fisher F. McAndrew P.C. Goding C.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5410-5420Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), to activate expression of the target genes. When the external concentration of orthophosphate is high, Pho81p effect on Pho85p is lowered. Consequently, Pho4p is hyperphosphorylated by the Pho80p-Pho85p complex and is therefore mainly located in the cytoplasm, resulting in a decreased expression of the PHO regulon. Although the late molecular events in the PHO pathway are relatively well characterized, little is known about how the external concentration of orthophosphate is sensed by the cells. Because PHO5 expression is constitutive in a pho84-defective mutant (16Ueda Y. Toh-E A. Oshima Y. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 122: 911-922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the possibility of a coupling between orthophosphate transport and sensing has been investigated recently (2Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was clearly shown that Pho84p is not an inorganic orthophosphate sensor because derepression of PHO5 is only a consequence of a reduced orthophosphate uptake in a pho84Δ mutant. Indeed, overexpression of any other orthophosphate carrier restored normal Pho5p levels (2Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, it has been shown recently (17Auesukaree C. Homma T. Tochio H. Shirakawa M. Kaneko Y. Harashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17289-17294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that expression of PHO5 was tightly correlated to intracellular orthophosphate concentration as measured by 31P NMR spectroscopy. Furthermore, these authors (17Auesukaree C. Homma T. Tochio H. Shirakawa M. Kaneko Y. Harashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17289-17294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) have also established that internal orthophosphate concentration was low in a pho84Δ mutant, thus confirming that Pho84p is most likely to affect phosphate signaling through its uptake capacity. By screening a yeast knock-out collection for resistance to sodium selenite, we found a striking correlation between expression of PHO84 and selenite resistance. Furthermore, we show that mutants affected in the low affinity orthophosphate transporter genes (PHO87, PHO90, and PHO91) are unable to maintain PHO84 repression under high orthophosphate conditions. In addition, we demonstrate that derepression of PHO84 in the low affinity orthophosphate permease mutants does not correlate with an impaired orthophosphate uptake capacity nor with a decreased cytosolic orthophosphate and/or polyPi concentrations. Yeast Media—YPD and SD media were prepared according to Sherman et al. (18Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). SD casaWA is SD medium supplemented with 0.2% casamino acids (Difco), tryptophan (40 mg/liter), and adenine (0.3 mm). The low orthophosphate media were prepared as described previously (19Bisson L.F. Thorner J. Genetics. 1982; 102: 341-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrations of orthophosphate in YPD, SdcasaWA, and orthophosphate-depleted YPD were measured (20Summer J.B. Science. 1944; 100: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) and found to be 6, 10, and less than 0.1 mm, respectively, consistent with values reported previously (19Bisson L.F. Thorner J. Genetics. 1982; 102: 341-359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium selenite (SeO3Na2) was purchased from Sigma (S-5261), and solutions were always prepared extemporaneously. Yeast Strain—All strains belong to, or are derived from, a set of 4787 disrupted strains isogenic to BY4742 (Matα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 lys2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0) purchased from Euroscarf. The single mutant strains used in this study are phm3Δ (Y16780), pho2Δ (Y13803), pho3Δ (Y13231), pho4Δ (Y15848), pho80Δ (Y11692), pho81Δ (Y15886), pho85Δ (Y12797), pho86Δ (Y11308), pho87Δ (Y15766), pho90Δ (Y11227), pho91Δ (Y15388), and yhr202wΔ (Y12896). All the double and triple mutants described in Table I were constructed from diploid strains obtained by mating. After sporulation and dissection, the double (or triple) mutant spores were identified by PCR using the kanB oligonucleotide (internal to KanMX4) and an oligonucleotide complementary to the promoter of the disrupted gene. The sodium selenite sensitivity, observed in this work for the pho2Δ, pho4Δ, pho81Δ, pho84Δ, and pho87Δ mutants, co-segregated with the disruption marker in the meiotic progeny and was complemented by the wild-type corresponding genes on a centromeric plasmid (data not shown). Furthermore, this sodium selenite sensitivity was also found for pho4Δ (EY0130) and pho81Δ (EY0138) null mutants constructed in the W303 genetic background (gift from Dr. E. O'Shea).Table IYeast strains constructed in this studyStrainGenotypeY1498Matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 pho87::kanMX4 pho90::kanMX4 pho91::kanMX4Y1516Matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0 pho84::kanMX4Y1533Matα his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 pho84::kanMX4 pho87::kanMX4Y1774Matα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 pho3::kanMX4 pho90::kanMX4Y1781Matα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 met15-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 pho4::kanMX4 pho91::kanMX4Y1784Matα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 pho81::kanMX4 pho91::kanMX4Y1785Matα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 lys2-Δ0 met15-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 pho2::kanMX4 pho91::kanMX4Y1787Matα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 lys2-Δ0 met15-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 pho2::kanMX4 pho90::kanMX4Y1790Matahis3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 lys2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 pho81::kanMX4 pho90::kanMX4Y1792Matα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 lys2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 pho81::kanMX4 pho87::kanMX4Y1793Matahis3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 met15-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 pho4::kanMX4 pho90::kanMX4Y1795Matahis3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 lys2-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 pho4::kanMX4 pho87::kanMX4Y1797Matα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ0 met15-Δ0 ura3-Δ0 pho2::kanMX4 pho87::kanMX4Y2261Matα his3-Δ1 leu2-Δ ura3-Δ0 phm3::kanMX4 pho90::kanMX4Y2272Matahis3Δ1 leu2Δ0 ura3Δ0 phm3::kanMX4; pho87::kanMX4 Open table in a new tab Plasmids—The tet-PHO84 plasmid (P2053), allowing overexpression of the PHO84 gene in the absence of tetracycline, was obtained by PCR amplification of the PHO84 open reading frame by using oligonucleotides 486 (5′-CCAATGCATCTTTTATGCTTCATGTTGAAG-3′) and 497 (5′-CGCGGATCCAAATGAGTTCCGTCAATAAAG-3′), followed by digestion of the PCR product with BamHI and NsiI and ligation in pCM189 plasmid (21Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) opened with BamHI and PstI. The same strategy was used to construct the tet-PHO89 plasmid (P2079) with oligonucleotides 525 (5′-CGCGGATCCAAATGGCTTTACATCAATTTG-3′) and 526 (5′-CCAATGCATTGATTATGTCATTGGTATTC-3′). The PHO84-lacZ plasmid (P2284) used for the β-galactosidase assays and harboring the lacZ gene under the control of PHO84 promoter was constructed by insertion of a PCR fragment (obtained with oligonucleotides 572 (5′-CGGAATTCGCGTTGGTGCTGTTATAG-3′) and 813 (5′-GAGGGCATGCATCTTCAATATGAGCAAAATCATTC-3′)) cut with EcoRI and SphI in YEp357 (22Myers A.M. Tzagoloff A. Kinney D.M. Lusty C.J. Gene (Amst.). 1986; 45: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) opened by EcoRI and SphI. Growth Test—Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C overnight on plates and then replica-plated on fresh medium and grown for an additional 6 h. Cells were then resuspended in sterile water to an A600 (absorbance at 600 nm) = 0.5 and submitted to 1/10 serial dilutions. Drops (5 μl) of each dilution were spotted on freshly prepared plates containing low or high orthophosphate SDcasaWA or YPD media and supplemented or not with sodium selenite at different concentrations. Plates were incubated for 48–72 h at 30 °C, depending on the medium used. Northern Blots—Yeast strains were grown to an A600 = 1. Total RNAs were isolated using the Tri-Reagent RNA/DNA/PROTEIN Isolation Reagent (EUROMEDEX). RNA blots were prepared and probed as described previously (23Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The labeled PCR fragments were amplified using S288C genomic DNA as template and oligonucleotides 676 (5′-GATTGAAACATCCATTTACCTG-3′) + 715 (5′-CGCGGATCCTTACCAATGTTTAAATCTGTTG-3′), 486, 497, and 559 (5′-CGGGATCCCCCATGGGCACATATA-3′) + 560 (5′-ATTAACTGCAGCAATCATGATTGTTCTTCGTC-3′) for PHO5, PHO84, and SPL2, respectively. The ACT1 probe was prepared as described previously (23Denis V. Boucherie H. Monribot C. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 557-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase Assays—β-Galactosidase assays were performed as described (24Kippert F. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 128: 201-206PubMed Google Scholar) on cells transformed with the PHO84-lacZ fusion plasmid (P2284). Each measurement was done at least twice on two to three independent transformants of two independent transformations. β-Galactosidase units are defined as ((A420 × 1000)/(A600 × min × ml)). Orthophosphate Uptake—Yeast strains were grown in SDcasaWA medium to A600 = 1. Cells harvested by centrifugation were washed twice in buffer A (50 mm potassium citrate, pH 4.5, 4% glucose) and resuspended in the same buffer at A600 = 1. Uptake measurement was started by addition of KH2[32P]PO4 (70 μl, 10–10,000 μm, specific radioactivity 5–1,000 Ci/mol) to 630 μl of cells suspension. Cells (200-μl aliquots) were taken at 1–3 min (period of time during which the uptake was linear, see this work and Ref. 2Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), filtered immediately on 0.8-μm filters (Supor®-800, Pall Life Science), and washed with 3 ml of ice-cold 0.5 m KH2PO4 buffer, pH 4.5. Radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Uptake parameters were determined by a nonlinear regression of the saturation curve using the Graph-Pad software. 31P NMR Spectroscopy—Yeast strains were grown overnight in 100 ml of YPD medium and were harvested at A600 = 1. Cells were centrifuged, and excess medium was removed to obtain a 500-μl cellular suspension. D2O (100 μl), and methylene diphosphonate, pH 6 (1 μmol), was added to the yeast suspension. 31P NMR spectroscopy analysis was performed with a Bruker Avance 500 narrow-bore spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm broad band probe. The 31P NMR signal was recorded (512 scans) with the following parameters: 5-μs pulse (∼53° flip angle), 0.81-s acquisition time, 0.5-s relaxation delay, 10,080-Hz sweep width, 16 K memory size, Waltz 16 proton decoupling, and D2O lock. The free induction decays were converted by Fourier transformation after applying a 4-Hz line broadening and a 32 K zero filling. Chemical shift scale was calibrated using 0 ppm for 85% phosphoric acid. Peak areas were determined with the Bruker integration routine using the methylene diphosphonate peak as reference. Peak areas were corrected for partial saturation using T1 values for the 31P nuclei in the various compounds as already described (25Beauvoit B. Rigoulet M. Raffard G. Canioni P. Guerin B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11212-11220Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To calculate cellular orthophosphate concentration from NMR spectra, duplicates of 200-μl aliquots of cells suspension used for NMR spectroscopy were dried at 80 °C for 48 h to determine the dry weight of the cells. In parallel, cellular volumes were measured with radiolabeled [3H]H2O and [14C]inulin as described (26Espie P. Devin A. Guerin B. Rigoulet M. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 591-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and correspond to a mean of 3.85 ± 0.12 μl/mg dry weight. 31P NMR measurements for cytosolic orthophosphate and polyPi (contained in the PP4-n peak, see Fig. 7) are given as millimolar of orthophosphate residues. Screening a Collection of Yeast Knock-out Mutants for Sodium Selenite Resistance Reveals a Link between Orthophosphate Uptake and Selenite Sensitivity—In a previous work (27Pinson B. Sagot I. Daignan-Fornier B. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), we had studied the effect of sodium selenite on yeast cells and isolated two gene dosage suppressors. To identify new yeast genes required for sodium selenite sensitivity, a collection of 4787 yeast haploid knock-out mutants were transferred to solid YPD medium supplemented or not with sodium selenite (5 and 10 mm). After 4 days at 30 °C, pho87Δ and yhr202wΔ mutants were clearly more resistant to sodium selenite than the wild type. Serial dilution on sodium selenite-containing medium further indicated that the pho87Δ mutant was slightly more resistant than yhr202wΔ (Fig. 2A). Because the function of the YHR202w gene product is unknown, we focused our attention on the PHO87 gene that encodes a low affinity orthophosphate carrier (2Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Bun-ya M. Shikata K. Nakade S. Yompakdee C. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Curr. Genet. 1996; 29: 344-351PubMed Google Scholar). We showed that the introduction of a plasmid carrying the PHO87 gene in the pho87Δ strain restored a wild-type sensitivity to sodium selenite of this mutant (data not shown). Mutant strains for the two other low affinity orthophosphate transporters (Pho90p and Pho91p) also displayed an increased sodium selenite resistance (Fig. 2B). However, resistance of the double or triple mutants was not markedly increased compared with the single mutant strains (data not shown). To gain further insight into relationships between sodium selenite and orthophosphate assimilation, several mutants involved in various aspects of phosphate metabolism were tested for sodium selenite resistance. Clearly, regulators of the PHO pathway, pho2Δ, pho4Δ, pho81Δ, and pho86Δ, were highly sensitive to sodium selenite (Fig. 2C), as was the strain deleted for the high affinity orthophosphate carrier gene PHO84. Most important, addition of a high concentration (25 mm) of orthophosphate to the growth medium alleviated sodium selenite sensitivity of all the phoΔ mutants and improved resistance of the wild-type strain to the drug (Fig. 2C), thus confirming the clear link between orthophosphate metabolism and sodium selenite sensitivity. Sensitivity to Sodium Selenite Correlates with Expression of PHO84—All the sodium selenite-sensitive mutants described in the previous section alter the expression or the localization of Pho84p. Indeed, it has been shown previously that PHO84 is not expressed in pho2Δ, pho4Δ, pho81Δ, and pho84Δ single mutant strains (Fig. 3A) (29Bun-Ya M. Nishimura M. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3229-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), and Pho84p is not correctly localized in the pho86Δ mutant strain (6Lau W.T. Howson R.W. Malkus P. Schekman R. O'Shea E.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1107-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The expression of PHO84 was monitored by Northern blot on yeast cells grown in high orthophosphate YPD medium (repression condition) (Fig. 3A). We found that the low basal expression of PHO84 is dependent on the presence of PHO2, PHO4, and PHO81 genes (Fig. 3A), as reported previously (30Ogawa N. Saitoh H. Miura K. Magbanua J.P. Bun-ya M. Harashima S. Oshima Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 406-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the PHO84 transcript was much more abundant in the sodium selenite-resistant pho87Δ mutant than in wild-type cells (Fig. 3A). Most important, PHO84 expression was not affected by selenite itself (Fig. 3A). We reasoned that if sodium selenite resistance in the pho87Δ mutant is due to PHO84 overexpression, it should be abolished in a pho84Δpho87Δ double mutant. Indeed, such a double mutant behaved as the single pho84Δ mutant on sodium selenite-containing medium (Fig. 3B). Thus, Pho84p is necessary for the sodium selenite resistance of the pho87Δ mutant, and overexpression of PHO84 in the pho87Δ mutant should be the primary cause for sodium selenite resistance. Indeed, the PHO84 gene placed under the control of a tetracycline-repressible promoter led to sodium selenite resistance in the absence, but not in the presence, of tetracycline (Fig. 3C). In contrast, overexpression of Pho89p, the other high affinity orthophosphate carrier (Fig. 3D), did not result in sodium selenite resistance (Fig. 3C). Therefore, our data reveal a tight and specific correlation between PHO84 expression and sodium selenite resistance. Finally, several general transcription machinery mutants, such as snf2Δ, gcn5Δ, spt7Δ, and spt2Δ, in which the expression of PHO84 was reported previously (31Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J.

Expression of PHO-regulated Genes Is Derepressed in the Presence of Inorganic Orthophosphate in the pho87Δ, pho90Δ, and pho91Δ Mutants—The data presented in the previous section revealed a role for PHO87 in the regulation of PHO84 expression under high orthophosphate conditions. To further characterize this effect, the expression of PHO84 was monitored in strains carrying the pho87Δ, pho90Δ, and pho91Δ deletions, either alone or combined. In these mutants, levels of PHO84 transcript were unaffected when cells were grown on low orthophosphate medium, whereas a clear derepression of the PHO84 transcript was observed in the mutant cells under high orthophosphate conditions (Fig. 4A). Transcription of another phosphate-regulated gene, SPL2, was also derepressed in the low affinity carrier mutants, establishing that the derepression mechanism does not specifically affect PHO84 (Fig. 4A). Finally, PHO5 expression monitored in a pho3Δpho90Δ double mutant (PHO5 expression cannot be monitored by Northern blot in a PHO3 background due to cross-hybridization between the two genes and constitutive expression of PHO3) was much higher than in the pho3Δ single mutant (Fig. 4B). We conclude that mutations in the low affinity orthophosphate carriers result in derepression of the PHO-regulated genes. Phosphate Repression Is Set Up Normally but Cannot be Maintained in the Absence of the Low Affinity Orthophosphate Transporters—Our results suggest that the presence of Pho87p, Pho90p, and/or Pho91p is required for normal phosphate repression of the PHO-regulated genes. To get a more dynamic vision of the phosphate repression phenomenon, expression of PHO84 in response to orthophosphate addition was monitored more precisely. When wild-type, pho90Δ, and pho87Δpho90Δpho91Δ cells were shifted from low orthophosphate (<100 μm) to high orthophosphate (5 mm) medium, the amount of PHO84 transcript dropped by more than 95%. This repression level was maintained after 2 h in the wild-type strain, whereas in the pho90Δ and the pho87Δpho90Δpho91Δ mutants, PHO84 repression was not conserved (Fig. 5). In fact, after 2 h, in the triple mutant strain the PHO84 gene expression was similar to the level observed in nonrepressible mutants such as pho80Δ and pho85Δ (Fig. 5). Derepression of PHO84 in the Low Affinity Carrier Mutants Does Not Correlate with Decreased Orthophosphate Uptake—A simple explanation for derepression of PHO84 in the pho87Δ, pho90Δ, or pho91Δ mutants could be that uptake capacity is lowered in the absence of the low affinity transporters, leading to constitutive orthophosphate starvation, as reported previously (2Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for pho84Δ mutants. Orthophosphate uptake measurements in wild-type, pho84Δ, and pho87Δpho90Δpho91Δ mutant strains were performed on cells grown under high orthophosphate conditions (Fig. 6A). Uptake parameters obtained in these conditions were determined by nonlinear regression. Saturation curves obtained for the wild-type and the pho84Δ mutant strains were correctly fitted with a single hyperbola regression with correlation coefficients >0.99. The kinetic parameters thus determined were KT = 1.0 ± 0.1 mm and Vmax = 0.70 ± 0.03 nmol of orthophosphate incorporated per min/107 cells for the wild-type strain and KT = 0.86 ± 0.17 mm and Vmax = 0.40 ± 0.02 nmol of orthophosphate incorporated per min/107 cells for the pho84Δ mutant strain. In contrast, the pho87Δpho90Δpho91Δ triple mutant curve could not be fitted with a single hyperbola but was correctly fitted with a double hyperbola regression curve with the following kinetic parameters: KT1 = 12.0 ± 0.1 μm and Vmax1 = 0.49 ± 0.01 nmol of orthophosphate incorporated per min/107 cells; KT2 = 3.6 ± 1.5 mm and Vmax2 = 1.5 ± 0.7 nmol of orthophosphate incorporated per min/107. Altogether, these results revealed that maximal uptake velocity (Vmax) was twice lower in the pho84Δ mutant as compared with wild type (Fig. 6A), in good agreement with results published previously (2Wykoff D.D. O'Shea E.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 1491-1499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in the pho87Δpho90Δpho91Δ triple mutant strain, the Vmax measured (=Vmax1 + Vmax2 = 2 nmol of orthophosphate incorporated per min/107) was higher than that of the wild-type strain, thus indicating that orthophosphate uptake capacity is clearly not diminished but rather increased in this strain (Fig. 6A). In the pho87Δpho90Δpho91Δ triple mutant, the KT1 for orthophosphate uptake most probably reflects the strong transcriptional derepression of the PHO84 gene that encodes a high affinity permease. Strikingly, expression of a PHO84-lacZ fusion was found more than three times higher in the triple mutant than in the pho84Δ mutant (Fig. 6B), although the triple mutant had much higher orthophosphate uptake capacities (Fig. 6A). Therefore, although"
https://openalex.org/W2071680558,"N-cadherin is expressed throughout skeletal myogenesis and has been proposed to be involved in the differentiation program of myogenic precursors. Here, we further characterize the N-cadherin involvement and its mechanism of action at the onset of differentiation, through controlled N-cadherin activation by plating isolated C2 myoblasts on surfaces coated with a chimeric Ncad-Fc homophilic ligand (N-cadherin ectodomain fused to the immunoglobulin G Fc fragment). We show that N-cadherin activation substitutes for the cell density in myogenic differentiation by promoting myogenin and troponin T expression. In addition, N-cadherin adhesion participates to the associated cell cycle arrest through the nuclear accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27. Mouse primary myoblast cultures exhibited similar responses to N-cadherin as C2 cells. RNA interference knockdowns of the N-cadherin-associated cytoplasmic proteins p120 and β-catenin produced opposite effects on the differentiation pathway. p120 silencing resulted in a decreased myogenic differentiation, associated with a reduction in cadherin-catenin content, which may explain its action on myogenic differentiation. β-Catenin silencing led to a stimulatory effect on myogenin expression, without any effect on cell cycle. Our results demonstrate that N-cadherin adhesion may account for cell-cell contact-dependent cell cycle arrest and differentiation of myogenic cells, involving regulation through p120 and β-catenins.

Our results demonstrate that N-cadherin adhesion may account for cell-cell contact-dependent cell cycle arrest and differentiation of myogenic cells, involving regulation through p120 and β-catenins. Skeletal myogenesis is a multi-step process, regulated by spatiotemporal cues in the embryo. The determination of the myogenic lineage, the differentiation of precursors in myoblasts, and their terminal differentiation leading to the formation of innervated muscle fibers are regulated by environmental signals provided by diffusible factors, extracellular matrix, and intercellular contacts (1Buckingham M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 2Brand-Saberi B. Christ B. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 296: 199-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Some of these developmental events require a high degree of coordination between changes in myoblast adhesion and the progression toward myogenesis, particularly during migration, alignment, and fusion of myoblasts associated with their exit from the cell cycle and the induction of histo-differentiation genes (3Knudsen K.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1990; 2: 902-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The adhesive properties of myogenic cells are modulated by the orchestrated expression of a combination of cell adhesion molecules, such as cadherins. At least four classical cadherins (R-, N-, M-, and 11) are expressed in embryonic muscles during mouse or chicken development (4Marthiens V. Gavard J. Lambert M. Mege R.M. Biol. Cell. 2002; 94: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 5George-Weinstein M. Gerhart J. Blitz J. Simak E. Knudsen K.A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Some cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily have also been proposed to play a role in myogenic differentiation (6Kang J.S. Feinleib J.L. Knox S. Ketteringham M.A. Krauss R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3989-3994Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 7Mege R.M. Goudou D. Diaz C. Nicolet M. Garcia L. Geraud G. Rieger F. J.

Nature. 1990; 344: 348-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the precise function of these cell adhesion molecules in the control of muscle differentiation remains elusive. Cadherins are major constituents of intercellular junctions mediating cell adhesion through Ca2+-dependent homophilic interaction of their extracellular domain and anchoring of their cytoplasmic domain to the actin cytoskeleton by catenins (10Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 11Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). They contribute to cell aggregation, segregation, and migration associated with dynamic cell-cell contact remodeling (10Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 12Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar, 13Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 207-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). A role for cadherins in myogenesis was first evidenced by functional perturbation of N-cadherin during Xenopus development (14Holt C.E. Lemaire P. Gurdon J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10844-10848Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The inhibition of N-cadherin-mediated contacts by specific antibodies perturbs myoblast fusion in vitro (7Mege R.M. Goudou D. Diaz C. Nicolet M. Garcia L. Geraud G. Rieger F. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 897-906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and impairs the induction of muscle-specific genes (5George-Weinstein M. Gerhart J. Blitz J. Simak E. Knudsen K.A. Dev. Biol. 1997; 185: 14-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Charrasse S. Meriane M. Comunale F. Blangy A. Gauthier-Rouviere C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Conversely, forced expression of N-cadherin in myogenic behavior fibroblastic cells promotes the expression of skeletal muscle proteins in three-dimensional cultures (16Redfield A. Nieman M.T. Knudsen K.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1323-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 17Seghatoleslami M.R. Myers L. Knudsen K.A. J. Cell Biochem. 2000; 77: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). When beads coated with the extracellular domain of N-cadherin were applied on subconfluent cultures of C2 myoblasts, myogenic differentiation was enhanced (18Goichberg P. Geiger B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3119-3131Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). However, myoblasts from mice bearing a null mutation of the N-cadherin gene differentiate normally in vitro and in vivo, likely because of a functional redundancy of cadherins expressed in skeletal muscle (19Charlton C.A. Mohler W.A. Radice G.L. Hynes R.O. Blau H.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is strengthened by the fact that cadherins R and M are expressed during myogenesis in vivo and have been shown to participate in skeletal muscle differentiation in vitro (20Donalies M.

However, no study has investigated whether the activation of cadherins (in the manner of growth factor receptors) is able to trigger myogenic cell differentiation autonomously. Recently, Ncad-Fc recombinant chimera (extracellular domain of cadherin fused to Fc fragment of immunoglobulin) were developed as tools to control cadherin homophilic binding and to study cellular responses triggered by cadherin activation, which resulted in significant progress in the determination of cadherin-initiated signaling pathways (26Lambert M.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We used this approach to investigate whether isolated N-cadherin activation could control myogenic differentiation. Our work demonstrates that N-cadherin engagement, independently of other cell adhesion molecules, is sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest and myogenic differentiation of C2 cells and primary myoblasts. The p120 catenin is required for myogenic differentiation, whereas β-catenin inhibits myogenic differentiation, independently of cell cycle regulation. Cell Culture and Induction of Myogenic Differentiation—The mouse myogenic C2 cell line (31Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) was maintained undifferentiated at low density in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) 1The abbreviations used are: DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; siRNA, small interfering RNA; dsRNA, double strand RNA; DM, differentiation medium; GM, growth medium; ld, low density of cells; hd, high density of cells; md, medium density of cell; Fn, fibronectin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; BrdU, bromodeoxyuridine; β-cat, β-catenin. supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (growth medium (GM)) under 7.5% CO2 at 37 °C. To induce differentiation, C2 cells were placed at high density (105 cells/cm2) in DMEM plus 2% horse serum (differentiation medium (DM)). For primary myoblast cell cultures, newborn mice (OF1 strain) were sacrificed according to guidelines of the local animal experimental ethics committee. The limbs were rinsed in PBS before dissecting muscle from the bones and cartilage. Tissues were incubated in PBS, 0.125% trypsin without EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C and dissociated by several flushes. The cell pellet was resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 10% horse serum and preplated for 6 h on uncoated tissue culture dishes. The floating cell population enriched in myoblasts was then allowed to attach on gelatin-coated dishes at 104 cells/cm2 (32Tassin A.M. Pincon-Raymond M. Paulin D. Rieger F. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 3747Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). After 2 days (three or four divisions) allowing the formation of small colonies, the culture medium was switched to DMEM plus 10% horse serum for differentiation. Antibodies and Reagents—The following antibodies were used for immunostaining: rabbit anti-myogenin (1:100, M225 clone; Santa Cruz, Tebu, Le Perray-en-Yvelines, France), mouse anti-Troponin T (1:50, clone JLT-12; Sigma), rabbit anti-p21 (1:200, C-19; Santa Cruz), and rabbit anti-p27 Kip1 (1:200, M-197; Santa Cruz). The following antibodies were used for Western blotting: mouse anti-pan cadherin (1:2000, clone CH19; Sigma), mouse anti-p120 (1:2000, clone 98; Transduction Laboratories, Becton Dickinson Europe, Le Pont de Claix, France), rabbit anti-β-catenin (1:5000; Sigma), mouse anti-γ-catenin/plakoglobin (1:2000, clone 15; Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-p27Kip1 (1:2000, clone 57; Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-troponin T (1:1000, clone JLT-12; Sigma), and mouse anti-myogenin (1:2000, clone F5D; Santa Cruz). DNA and siRNA Transfections—C2 cells grown at 5 × 104 cells/cm2 (mid-confluence) in GM without antibiotics were transfected with the LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). 5 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 were mixed with 2 μgof DNA expression vector or 100–500 nm of dsRNA duplexes in 100 μl of Opti-MEM medium for 30 min. The cells were incubated with this mixture for 24 h in GM without antibiotics, and differentiation was induced by medium switch when cells reached confluence. The cells were either fixed for immunostaining or submitted to protein extraction for Western blotting, after 2 days in DM corresponding to 3 days post-lipofection. The following DNA vectors were used: (control DNA) pSUPER (33Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R.

The RNA duplex sequence used for β-catenin silencing corresponds to the 492–498 amino acids of the mouse sequence (NM007614) and was noted β-cat siRNA: rCrUrGrUrUrGrUrGrGrUrUrArArArCrUrCrCrUTT (Proligo, Paris, France). As a control RNA, we used inefficient RNA duplex corresponding to the 79–85 amino acids sequence (control dsRNA): rArGrCrUrGrArUrArUrGrArCrGrGrGrCrArGTT. Preparation of Adhesion Substrates and N-cadherin Activation— Fibronectin (Fn, 1 μg/cm2; PAA Laboratories, GmbH Linz, Austria) and N-cadherin homophilic ligand, Ncad-Fc (Ncad-Fc, 5 μg/cm2) (26Lambert M. Padilla F. Mege R.M. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2207-2219Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were coated on silanized glass coverslips or thermosterilized bacterial dishes (Falcon, Becton Dickinson Europe) as reported previously (30Gavard J. Lambert M. Grosheva I. Marthiens V. Irinopoulou T. Riou J.F. Bershadsky A. Mege R.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Alternatively, soluble chimera was directly diluted in DM at the final concentration of 50 μg/ml in the presence of 3% bovine serum albumin. The C2 cells were mechanically dissociated in PBS, 5 mm EDTA, 2% bovine serum albumin on ice and plated on different coated surfaces in the absence of serum and at low density (ld; 103 cells/cm2) (30Gavard J. Lambert M. Grosheva I. Marthiens V. Irinopoulou T. Riou J.F. Bershadsky A. Mege R.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). After 2 h of adhesion, the medium was changed to GM or DM and renewed every day during the time of the experiments. Immunostainings and BrdU Incorporation—C2 cells were fixed in PBS with 3% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 15 min, washed in PBS with 0.1 m glycine, and permeabilized in PBS with 0.5% Triton for 5 min. Primary antibodies were revealed using goat fluorescein isothiocyanate- or TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins G (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA) or goat AlexaFluor 488 or AlexaFluor 546-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulins G (1:500; Molecular Probes Europe, Leiden, Holland). The nuclei were counterstained with Hoechst-33258 (1:20,000; Molecular Probes). The samples mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem) were observed by conventional microscopy (Provis; Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan), and the images were captured with a Micromax CCD camera driven with the Metamorph software (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ). To visualize cells in the S phase, BrdU (10 μm; Roche Applied Science) was added to the medium 4 h before cell fixation. Fixed cells were treated with PBS-Triton 0.5% plus HCl 2 N at 37 °C during 30 min to denature DNA, rinsed extensively with borate 0.1 m pH 8.0 and PBS before immunostaining with mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdU antibody (1:200; Roche Applied Science). Quantitative Analysis—Immunostaining experiments were quantified by manual counts of the positive nuclei (except positive cytoplasm for troponin T labeling) related to the total number of nuclei stained by Hoechst. Microscopy fields were taken under constant time illumination, oriented up to down and left to right on the glass coverslips, always beginning by Hoechst labeling. Five fields were counted corresponding to 500 cells in hd conditions; at least 10 fields were counted corresponding to 100 cells in ld conditions. Each experiment was independently repeated three times. The results are expressed as the percentages of the mean of the positive/total ratios (except ratio of control for siRNA experiment performed after 2 days of DM culture). The χ2 test was used for statistical analysis of all the data sets: * for p < 0.1, ** for p < 0.01, *** for p < 0.001, and **** for p < 0.0001. Whole Cell Lysates and Western Blotting—To prepare whole cell lysates, the samples were incubated in 200 μl of 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% SDS for 20 min on ice, scraped, and submitted to sonication. Equal amounts of proteins, 10–50 μg/lane estimated by micro-BCA (Pierce) were analyzed by 7 or 13% SDS-PAGE and blotted on 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membranes, as previously described (34Monnet C. Marthiens V. Enslen H. Frobert Y. Sobel A. Mege R.M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2003; 18: 542-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The secondary goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Dako (1:10000, Glostrup, Denmark). Blots were developed for chemiluminescence using the ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and could be rehybridized using the Western stripping kit from Pierce. Mouse C2 cells (31Yaffe D. Saxel O. Nature. 1977; 270: 725-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) are classically induced to differentiate at high density (hd) in low serum-containing medium (DM). Although proliferating C2 cells express the transcription factor MyoD (80% of MyoD-immunopositive cells; data not shown), the related transcription factor myogenin is an early marker of their differentiation (35Andres V. Walsh K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 657-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The expression of myogenin at hd:DM was detected after 1 day and increased up to day 3 (Fig. 1A), whereas undetectable in cells cultured for 3 days at low density in DM (ld:DM), or maintained at high density in growth medium (hd:GM). Thus, myogenin expression is dependent both on serum content and cell density, likely through the establishment of cell-cell contacts. We hypothesized that N-cadherin may be a molecular factor involved in the cell-cell contact effect. N-cadherin-based Adhesion Controls the Induction of Myogenic Differentiation—In the high density conditions, cells integrate information from both cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts. Selective engagement of N-cadherin was achieved by spreading cells at low density on Ncad-Fc coated surfaces (30Gavard J. Lambert M. Grosheva I. Marthiens V. Irinopoulou T. Riou J.F. Bershadsky A. Mege R.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), allowing N-cadherin “activation” or “engagement” independently of other stimulations emerging from cell-cell or cell-matrix contacts (Fig. 1B). As a control for the contribution of cell-matrix contact, C2 cells were spread on the extracellular matrix protein Fn or laminin (data not shown) at low density. The contribution of N-cadherin-based adhesion to the C2 cell differentiation was assessed through the expression of myogenin and the histodifferentiation marker troponin T. Myogenin and troponin T immunolabeling were each present in around 30% of cells after 3 days of culture on Ncad-Fc in DM, similar to hd:DM conditions (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, the relative numbers of myogenin-positive nuclei and troponin T-positive cells were significantly lower on fibronectin (Fig. 1, C and D). The induction of troponin T expression either by hd or by Ncad-Fc was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1E). The time course of appearance of myogenin-positive nuclei in C2 cells cultured at low density on Ncad-Fc was indistinguishable from that observed in hd:DM conditions (Fig. 1F), demonstrating that N-cadherin activation promotes myogenin expression from day 1, as efficiently as hd. Because myogenin-positive nuclei were undetectable in GM on Ncad-Fc (data not shown), myogenin expression requires serum withdrawal in addition to N-cadherin activation. Thus, these results indicate that N-cadherin activation is sufficient to mimic the effect of cell-cell contact on the myogenic differentiation of C2 cells. To characterize the involvement of N-cadherin in this process, we performed a dose-response analysis of N-cadherin-triggered myogenin expression. The myogenin-positive nuclei at day 3 was low for Ncad-Fc concentration inferior to 2 μg/cm2 and increased with Ncad-Fc concentration to reach a plateau at 5 μg/cm2 (Fig. 1G). Soluble Ncad-Fc was unable to induce myogenin expression at ld:DM with concentrations as high as 50 μg/ml (data not shown). Our data suggest that the N-cadherin adhesion receptor induces myogenin expression through a dose-dependent, solid phase homophilic binding to the N-cadherin extracellular domain (i.e. N-cadherin activation). Therefore, N-cadherin is sufficient to substitute for the cell-cell contact in the myogenic differentiation. N-cadherin Activation Triggers Cell Cycle Arrest Prior to Differentiation—Previous reports show that N-cadherin overexpression leads to the up-regulation of p27 in Chinese hamster ovary fibroblastic cells (36Levenberg S. Yarden A. Kam Z. Geiger B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 869-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), controlling cell cycle arrest. We wondered whether N-cadherin activation could be involved autonomously in the cell cycle arrest during differentiation program of myoblasts. The nuclear accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitors p21 and p27 was analyzed by immunostaining after 3 days in DM. Isolated C2 cells on Ncad-Fc exhibited 57 and 76% of p21- and p27-positive nuclei, respectively (Fig. 2, A and B), similar proportions of cdk inhibitor-positive nuclei (75 and 82% for p21 and p27, respectively) were observed for hd:DM conditions (Fig. 2B). In contrast, C2 cells cultured on fibronectin exhibited only 30% of cdk inhibitor-positive nuclei (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition to this nuclear accumulation of cdk inhibitors, Western blot analysis reveals higher levels of p27 in hd:DM or in ld:DM on Ncad-Fc, compared with fibronectin (Fig. 2C). Thus, the activation of N-cadherin induces p21 and p27 nuclear accumulation during myogenic differentiation, supporting the notion that N-cadherin activation mimics the cell-cell contact action on cell cycle arrest. We also performed different approaches to directly evaluate the action of isolated N-cadherin activation on cell cycle progression. The proliferation of C2 cells on Ncad-Fc or fibronectin was estimated by counting viable cells cultivated in ld:GM or ld:DM conditions (Fig. 2D). The number of cells was increased by 10-fold on fibronectin and only by 4-fold on Ncad-Fc on the third day in GM. C2 cells also proliferated on fibronectin in low serum medium (6-fold increase), whereas the combination of Ncad-Fc and low serum led to a complete abrogation of cell multiplication. The involvement of N-cadherin in the adhesion-dependent cell cycle arrest was further evaluated through BrdU incorporation and p21 coimmunostaining after 24 h. Although 42% (DM) and 60% (GM) of cells on fibronectin displayed BrdU incorporation together with negative staining for p21 (BrdU+/p21–), they were only 11% (DM) and 23% (GM) on Ncad-Fc (Fig. 2E). Similar proportions of BrdU+/p21– nuclei were observed at hd:DM (Fig. 2E). Conversely, only 26% of cells cultivated on fibronectin were negative for BrdU and positive for p21 (BrdU–/p21+), whereas 55% of cells on Ncad-Fc were BrdU–/p21+ (compared with 63% for hd; Fig. 2E). Thus, our experiments demonstrate that N-cadherin activation is sufficient to diminish the proportion of cells that passes through the S phase, again suggesting that N-cadherin negatively regulates cell cycle progression during myogenic differentiation. The link between cell cycle arrest and myogenic differentiation was then investigated through BrdU incorporation in combination with myogenin or p21 immunostaining at ld:DM on Ncad-Fc (Fig. 2F). After 1 day, 18% of cells were engaged in differentiation (BrdU–/myogenin+) whereas 50% were stopped in the cell cycle (BrdU–/p21+). By 3 days, more than 76% of the cells belonged to the BrdU–/p21+ population, but they were only 31% with BrdU–/myogenin+ staining. Moreover, less than 5% of myogenin-positive cells had incorporated BrdU (BrdU+/myogenin+), suggesting that the induction of myogenin in cycling cells is a rare event. The uncycled and differentiated population (BrdU–/myogenin+) belongs at least partially to the population of cells stopped in cell cycle (BrdU–/p21+). Altogether, our results show that N-cadherin receptor activation regulates cell cycle arrest associated with myogenic differentiation. N-cadherin Activation Induces Differentiation of Mouse Primary Myoblasts—To expand the results obtained in the C2 cell line to a more physiologically relevant system, the involvement of N-cadherin activation was examined in primary myoblasts from newborn mice. Proliferating myoblasts were allowed to adhere on gelatin-coated dishes and to divide three or four times as small colonies (2 days), as previously described (32Tassin A.M. Pincon-Raymond M. Paulin D. Rieger F. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 3747Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Myoblasts were induced to differentiate by serum switch, and their proliferation/differentiation state was evaluated both by Western blotting and by immunostaining for myogenin or p21. We first observed by Western blot the expected induction of myogenin in differentiating myoblasts. Two-day-old mouse primary myoblasts did not express detectable levels of myogenin in GM, but myogenin expression was induced as early as 0.5 day in DM (Fig. 3A). Alternatively, 2-day-old proliferating myoblasts were platted as isolated cells on Ncad-Fc or fibronectin in DM. N-cadherin activation induced the nuclear accumulation of myogenin (69%) or p21 (67%) (Fig. 3, B and C), similar to typical differentiating conditions (colonies in DM on gelatin). Significantly less primary myoblasts were stained for myogenin (33%) or p21 (47%) on fibronectin (Fig. 3, B and C). Thus, as in the C2 cell line, N-cadherin activation regulates cell cycle arrest and differentiation of mouse primary myoblasts. Experimental Modulation of Cadherin-Catenin Complexes during Myogenic Differentiation—Because p120 and β-catenin are directly associated to cadherins and regulate their functions (37Wheelock M.J. Johnson K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we postulated that they may be involved downstream of N-cadherin activation during myogenic differentiation. To investigate the contribution of these proteins to the control of myogenic differentiation, RNA interference strategy was chosen to reduce their expression. For p120, we used a previously described vector coding for a p120-specific dsRNA (30Gavard J. Lambert M. Grosheva I. Marthiens V. Irinopoulou T. Riou J.F. Bershadsky A. Mege R.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that transfected cells exhibited a significant decrease in p120 protein after 3 days of culture either in proliferation (md:GM) or differentiation (hd: DM) conditions (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, p120 silencing led to a global decrease in the expression of cadherin and β-catenin, as previously reported (30Gavard J. Lambert M. Grosheva I. Marthiens V. Irinopoulou T. Riou J.F. Bershadsky A. Mege R.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 38Davis M.A. Ireton R.C. Reynolds A.B. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). For β-catenin, we designed a synthetic siRNA duplex in its coding region"
https://openalex.org/W2062486325,"CEL-III is a Ca2+-dependent and galactose-specific lectin purified from the sea cucumber, Cucumaria echinata, which exhibits hemolytic and hemagglutinating activities. Six molecules of CEL-III are assumed to oligomerize to form an ion-permeable pore in the cell membrane. We have determined the crystal structure of CELIII by using single isomorphous replacement aided by anomalous scattering in lead at 1.7 Å resolution. CEL-III consists of three distinct domains as follows: the N-terminal two carbohydrate-binding domains (1 and 2), which adopt β-trefoil folds such as the B-chain of ricin and are members of the (QXW)3 motif family; and domain 3, which is a novel fold composed of two α-helices and one β-sandwich. CEL-III is the first Ca2+-dependent lectin structure with two β-trefoil folds. Despite sharing the structure of the B-chain of ricin, CEL-III binds five Ca2+ ions at five of the six subdomains in both domains 1 and 2. Considering the relatively high similarity among the five subdomains, they are putative binding sites for galactose-related carbohydrates, although it remains to be elucidated whether bound Ca2+ is directly involved in interaction with carbohydrates. The paucity of hydrophobic interactions in the interfaces between the domains and biochemical data suggest that these domains rearrange upon carbohydrate binding in the erythrocyte membrane. This conformational change may be responsible for oligomerization of CEL-III molecules and hemolysis in the erythrocyte membranes.

This conformational change may be responsible for oligomerization of CEL-III molecules and hemolysis in the erythrocyte membranes. A number of lectins have been found in tissues and body fluids in various animals. They play important roles in the recognition of specific carbohydrate chains. Animal lectins are categorized into several groups based on their structures (1Kilpatrick D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Among them, Ca2+-dependent lectins, such as those containing C-type carbohydrate-recognition domains (2Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), include various proteins that exhibit carbohydrate binding activity depending on the concentration of Ca2+ (3Day A.J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1994; 22: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Four Ca2+-dependent and Gal/GalNAc-specific lectins (CEL-I-IV, respectively) have been isolated from the body fluid of the sea cucumber, Cucumaria echinata (4Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Among them, CEL-I and CEL-IV belong to the C-type lectin family (5Hatakeyama T. Matsuo N. Shiba K. Nishinohara S. Yamasaki N. Sugawara H. Aoyagi H. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 2002; 66: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Hatakeyama T. Ohuchi K. Kuroki M. Yamasaki N. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1995; 59: 1314-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), whereas CEL-III is a novel lectin that exhibits strong hemolytic and cytotoxic activities (4Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Hatakeyama T. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3560-3564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 8Oda T. Tsuru M. Hatakeyama T. Nagatomo H. Muramatsu T. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem.

(Tokyo). 1999; 125: 713-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). These activities are mediated by binding of the protein to the specific carbohydrate chains on the target cells, followed by the formation of ion-permeable pores in the cell membrane through oligomerization of the protein. After formation of the pores, erythrocytes are ruptured by colloid osmotic shock. CEL-III oligomers of ∼270 kDa were found in the erythrocyte membranes lysed by CEL-III (10Hatakeyama T. Furukawa M. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. Mori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16915-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This suggests that a CEL-III oligomer in the membrane is composed of six monomers. Most interestingly, when incubated with β-galactosides (e.g. lactose), CEL-III also oligomerized in an aqueous solution with an alkaline pH under high ionic strength conditions (10Hatakeyama T. Furukawa M. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. Mori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16915-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This oligomer had the same size on SDS-PAGE as that formed in the lysed erythrocyte membrane. This suggests that the binding of specific carbohydrates is important in facilitating oligomerization of CEL-III. Binding to specific carbohydrate chains on the target cell membranes probably triggers conformational change of CEL-III, and this leads to its oligomerization followed by insertion into the cell membrane. This assumption is also supported by the fact that CEL-III underwent secondary structural change accompanied by an increase of its surface hydrophobicity (10Hatakeyama T. Furukawa M. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. Mori T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16915-16920Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) after the binding of carbohydrates and subsequent oligomerization.The amino acid sequence of CEL-III was determined by sequence analysis of its cDNA and peptide fragments derived from enzymatic cleavage (11Nakano M. Tabata S. Sugihara K. Kouzuma Y. Kimura M. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The results suggested that CELIII is composed of three portions (domains 1-3) based on the similarity of its internal sequence. Most interestingly, domains 1 and 2, which include cysteines involved in disulfide bonds, exhibited definite homology with the B-chains of the toxic lectins, ricin from Ricinus communis (12Montfort W. Villafranca J.E. Monzingo A.F. Ernst S.R. Katzin B. Rutenber E. Xuong N.H. Hamlin R. Robertus J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5398-5403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and abrin from Abrus precatorius (13Tahirov T.H. Lu T.-H. Liaw Y.-C. Chen Y.-L. Lin J.-Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 354-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The B-chains of these proteins are known to be lectin subunits, which are composed of two carbohydrate-binding domains (CBDs), 1The abbreviations used are: CBD, carbohydrate-binding domain; BisTris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)imino-tris(hydroxymethyl)-methane; r.m.s., root mean square; PDB, Protein Data Bank.1The abbreviations used are: CBD, carbohydrate-binding domain; BisTris, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)imino-tris(hydroxymethyl)-methane; r.m.s., root mean square; PDB, Protein Data Bank. whereas their A-chains exert N-glycosidase activity and inactivate 50 S subunits of ribosomes in eukaryotic cells. In contrast, no proteins have been found as a homologue of domain 3 of CEL-III. Because domain 3 includes the hydrophobic region around residues 322-349, it was assumed responsible for self-oligomerization and insertion into the target cell membrane in the course of the hemolytic process. This is also supported by experiments using individual domain fragments produced by partial digestion by using proteases and the recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli cells (14Kouzuma Y. Suzuki Y. Nakano M. Matsuyama K. Tojo S. Kimura M. Yamasaki T. Aoyagi H. Hatakeyama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In these experiments, domains 1 and 2 exhibited carbohydrate binding activity, whereas domain 3 showed a tendency to oligomerize immediately after production. These results strongly suggest that hemolysis by CEL-III proceeds through cooperative action of its functional domains; the binding of domains 1 and 2 to carbohydrate chains on the cell surface triggers conformational change of CEL-III, which promotes association of domain 3, followed by its insertion into the cell membrane. A similar pore-forming mechanism is also proposed in the cases of bacterial pore-forming toxins (15Song L. Hobaugh M.R. Shustak C. Cheley S. Bayley H. Gouaux J.E. Science. 1996; 274: 1859-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar, 16Olson R. Nariya H. Yokota K. Kamio Y. Gouaux E. Nat. Struct.

Nature. 1997; 385: 833-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the crystal structure of CEL-III at 1.7 Å resolution. From the determined structure, three distinct domains are revealed as expected from the amino acid sequence. Domains 1 and 2 were each found to adopt a β-trefoil structure similar to the ricin B-chain. CEL-III and the B-chain of ricin belong to the (QXW)3 family proteins (18Hazes B. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1490-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In contrast to the cases of the other β-trefoil lectins, domains 1 and 2 of CEL-III bound five Ca2+ and two Mg2+ ions, and Ca2+ may be associated with recognition of specific carbohydrates. On the other hand, domain 3 contains characteristic β-sheets and two α-helices. These α-helices are located at the interface between carbohydrate-binding domains (1 and 2) and domain 3, and are assumed to make conformational change upon binding to the cell surface carbohydrates. These results suggest a probable structural change of CEL-III to form membrane-associated oligomers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of CEL-III—Specimens of C. echinata were collected from the Sea of Genkai, Fukuoka, Japan. CEL-III was purified from the body fluid of C. echinata by chromatography using lactose-Cellulofine, GalNAc-Cellulofine, and Sephadex G-75 columns, essentially as described previously (4Hatakeyama T. Kohzaki H. Nagatomo H. Yamasaki N. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined from the molar absorption coefficients at 280 nm calculated from the amino acid compositions of the proteins.Crystallization—Initial crystallization screening experiments for CEL-III (5.0 mg/ml) were carried out at both 4 and 20 °C using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. Two microliters of 5.0 mg/ml CEL-III in 10 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, and 10 mm CaCl2 were mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution. Thin crystals were obtained at 4 °C using 30% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, and 200 mm sodium acetate as a reservoir solution. The optimized crystallization was done at 20 °C with a reservoir solution of 12% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm BisTris/NaOH, pH 6.5, and 200 mm magnesium acetate. Crystals (∼0.05 × 0.2 × 0.3 mm in size), large enough for x-ray diffraction analysis, were grown within 1 week by microseeding. Heavy atom derivatives were obtained by soaking native crystals for 5 days in the mother liquor containing 10 mm lead acetate. The crystals were soaked in the reservoir solution supplemented by 20% (v/v) ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant. Cryoprotected crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen before data collection.X-ray Diffraction Data Collection—Diffraction images from native crystals were collected using synchrotron radiation on beamline BL6A at the Photon Factory (Tsukuba, Japan) at 100 K using a CCD detector, Quantum 4R (ADSC, Poway, CA). X-ray diffraction images from a lead derivative crystal were collected on beamline BL44XU at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) at 100 K using an imaging plate detector, DIP6040 (MAC Science, Japan). Both sets of images were indexed and integrated using the program MOSFLM (19Powell H.R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Refinement—We assumed that the asymmetric unit has two CEL-III molecules based on a Matthews coefficient (21Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7899) Google Scholar) (VM of 2.3 Å3/Da). Native Patterson maps showed a strong peak at u = 0.5, v = 0.08, w = 0.5, indicating a noncrystallographic translation without rotation between the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Binding sites of four lead atoms were determined by inspection of Harker sections in the difference Patterson maps. Heavy atom parameters were refined using the program MLPHARE (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19703) Google Scholar) and then using the program SHARP (22de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1796) Google Scholar); phases were calculated by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering. Additional four lead atom positions were determined using difference Fourier techniques. The resultant phases at 2.7 Å with a figure of merit of 0.42 were improved by density modification using the programs SOLOMON (23Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) and RESOLVE (24Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). Molecular boundaries of CEL-III were defined using the programs O (25Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13003) Google Scholar), MAPMAN (26Kleywegt G.J. Read R.J. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1557-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and MAMA (27Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 941-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) to produce mask data, which then were used to refine the noncrystallographic symmetry by maximizing correlation between the electron density maps of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit using the program IMP (26Kleywegt G.J. Read R.J. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 1557-1569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the program DM (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19703) Google Scholar) was used to refine and extend phases to 1.7 Å resolution using noncrystallographic symmetry. The resultant electron density maps were well defined for the whole molecules, and the model was built using the program O. The model was refined using the programs REFMAC5 (28Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar) and ARP/wARP (29Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Noncrystallographic symmetry restraints, imposed in the early stage of refinement, were removed in the later stage. At the final stage of refinement, we noticed conflicting amino acid residues between sequences derived from the electron density maps and from the chemical analysis. Hence, 13 residues were replaced as described under “Results.” The quality of the model was checked using the programs PRO-CHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (31Hooft W.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). The R-factors were further improved with TLS refinement (20Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19703) Google Scholar).RESULTSStructure Determination—CEL-III samples were purified from body fluid of C. echinata. Crystals were obtained by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method. The crystal data are shown in Table I. A molecular replacement method with the B-chains of ricin or abrin as a search model, having 12 and 16% sequence identities with CEL-III, respectively, did not give good results. Hence, the crystal structure of CEL-III was determined by single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering of lead. Statistics related to data collection, phasing, and refinement are summarized in Table I. Electron density maps enabled us to reliably trace all 432 residues. The N-terminal residue was assigned to pyroglutamate according to the published sequence (11Nakano M. Tabata S. Sugihara K. Kouzuma Y. Kimura M. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). By using omit electron density maps, we found conflicts between our inferred sequences of 13 residues and sequences reported previously (11Nakano M. Tabata S. Sugihara K. Kouzuma Y. Kimura M. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These residues were replaced as follows: N15S, Y16F, H36Y, M48I, L92Q, K95R, A97T, V122I, I146V, E173D, Q204S, S340T, and I404V. The reason for such discrepancies is not clear. However, since some differences have been found between protein sequence and that deduced from cDNA, as reported previously (11Nakano M. Tabata S. Sugihara K. Kouzuma Y. Kimura M. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), these discrepancies may have arisen from microheterogeneity of this protein. In this study, we used the sequence deduced from the electron density map, because they were unambiguously identified. Substitution of BisTris buffer for sodium cacodylate buffer in the crystallization solution was critical for producing better crystals. A BisTris molecule was observed in a cavity of the CEL-III molecule, which may contribute to stabilization of the crystal structure. The two CEL-III molecules (A and B) in the asymmetric unit were essentially the same with an r.m.s. Cα discrepancy of 0.55 Å for 432 residues; residues 356-361 were noticeably different between the two molecules because of their flexibility. Eight peaks with medium to high electron densities per molecule of CEL-III were found in the electron density map. Five Ca2+, two Mg2+, and one Cl- ion per molecule were assigned in order to flatten difference Fourier maps (Table II). Fig. 1 shows an omit electron density map for a Ca2+ ion, surrounding residues, and two water molecules (subdomain 2β, as described below). We describe the molecular structure of CEL-III referring only to molecule A of CEL-III. The final and free R-factors were 16.5 and 20.1%, respectively. Asp-373 was found in the disallowed region in the Ramachandran plot, but its model fitted well to an omit map.Table IIElectron density heights and coordination data for ionsIonIon-binding siteMolecule AaMolecules A and B are two molecules in the asymmetric unit.Molecule BaMolecules A and B are two molecules in the asymmetric unit.Electron densitybThese values refer to difference Fourier maps, in which the F(000) was included.B-factorBond distanceNo. ligandsElectron densitybThese values refer to difference Fourier maps, in which the F(000) was included.B-factorBond distanceNo. ligandse/Å3Å2Åe/Å3Å2ÅCa2+Subdomain 1α1.533.82.371.243.12.26Subdomain 1βcNo electron density peaks corresponding to Ca2+ were observed.Subdomain 1γ1.244.82.471.245.22.46Subdomain 2α0.9257.82.261.144.22.16Subdomain 2β1.531.62.261.728.92.16Subdomain 2γ1.827.22.471.826.22.47Mg2+Center of domain 10.9838.32.461.041.52.46Center of domain 21.325.52.461.421.82.46Cl−0.9845.33.231.044.83.13a Molecules A and B are two molecules in the asymmetric unit.b These values refer to difference Fourier maps, in which the F(000) was included.c No electron density peaks corresponding to Ca2+ were observed. Open table in a new tab Molecular Structure of CEL-III—Sequence analysis (11Nakano M. Tabata S. Sugihara K. Kouzuma Y. Kimura M. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and biochemical data (14Kouzuma Y. Suzuki Y. Nakano M. Matsuyama K. Tojo S. Kimura M. Yamasaki T. Aoyagi H. Hatakeyama T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2003; 134: 395-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) indicated that CEL-III consists of two N-terminal CBDs and a C-terminal oligomerization domain containing two hydrophobic regions, the former being homologous to the B-chains of ricin and abrin. The crystal structure of CEL-III supported its three-domain architecture as shown in Fig. 2, A and B. The two CBDs, domains 1 (residues 1-149) and 2 (residues 150-283), share a similar fold with an r.m.s. Cα discrepancy of 0.77 Å between the corresponding 115 residues. Domains 1 and 2 show 33.8% sequence identity for 145 residues. Domains 1 and 2 each have a β-trefoil fold with a pseudo 3-fold rotation axis (32Murzin A.G. Lesk A.M. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) and are divided into subdomains 1α (1-50), 1β (51-101), 1γ (102-149), 2α (150-195), 2β (196-241), and 2γ (242-283); residue ranges are in parentheses. Subdomains 1α through 2γ have lengths of 42-51 residues and resemble each other (Fig. 3), with an averaged pairwise r.m.s. Cα discrepancy of 0.62 Å for the corresponding 29 residues. As expected from the internal sequence similarities (11Nakano M. Tabata S. Sugihara K. Kouzuma Y. Kimura M. Yamasaki N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1435: 167-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the structures of subdomains are very similar, except for subdomain 1β. Although domains 1 and 2 of CEL-III resemble the B-chain of ricin (Fig. 4), the relative arrangement of the two domains of CEL-III is different from those of ricin. When domain 1 of CEL-III is superimposed on that of the B-chain of ricin, domain 2 of CEL-III deviates by a 60° clockwise rotation from that of the B-chain of ricin. The C-terminal domain, domain 3 (residues 284-432), comprises two α-helices (H8 and H9) and an eight-stranded β-sandwich. Domain 3 is a unique structure, and it has no structurally similar proteins in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using the DALI search program (33Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar). The two β-sheets (one consisting of β27 and β29; the other consisting of β25, β26, β28, β30, β31, and β32) of the β-sandwich in domain 3 are held together by hydrophobic interactions. Two α-helices, H8 and H9, lie on the surface of the β-sandwich in parallel with the β-sandwich surface and perpendicular to the longest β-strand β30. A C-terminal helical loop of 25 residues is stabilized by two disulfide bonds as shown in Fig. 2, A and B. All 24 cysteine residues form 12 disulfide bonds, none of which is an interdomain disulfide bond in CEL-III. Two Mg2+ each lie on the pseudo 3-fold axes of the two β-trefoil domains, and two and three Ca2+ ions were found in domains 1 and 2, respectively. They were assigned based on difference Fourier maps, coordination numbers, bond distances, and ligand atoms consisting exclusively of oxygen (Figs. 1 and 5A and Table II). It seems possible that the binding of two Mg2+ ions at the pseudo 3-fold axes of the β-trefoil domains resulted from the relatively high concentration of Mg2+ (200 mm) compared with that of Ca2+ (10 mm) under the crystallization conditions in this study, and these positions might be occupied by Ca2+ in the absence of a high concentration of Mg2+. In each subdomain, except for subdomain 1β, the Ca2+ is coordinated by the side chain oxygen atoms of two Asp residues (e.g. Asp-256 and Asp-276 for subdomain 2γ in Fig. 5A), the main chain carbonyl groups of Ile/Val and Gly residues (shaded cyan in Fig. 5B; e.g. Val-257 and Gly-259 in Fig. 5A), and two or three water molecules (shown in Fig. 5A). Table II shows the electron density heights and temperature factors of plausible Ca2+, Mg2+, and Cl- for the two CEL-III molecules in the asymmetric unit. The descending order of heights for five Ca2+ ions in the subdomains is almost the same for molecules A and B as shown in Table II, namely 2γ, 2β, 1α, 1γ, and 2α. The distribution of temperature factors for α-carbons along the peptide chain is very similar for the two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The temperature factors of domains 2 and 3 as a whole are low, whereas those of domain 1 are relatively high. It is also noted that the temperature factors of the front part of the molecule in Fig. 2A are high compared with those of the distant part.Fig. 2Three-dimensional structure and topology diagram of CEL-III.A, ribbon model of a CEL-III molecule. Domains 1-3 are colored blue, green, and orange, respectively. The color gradation is shown from bright (e.g. subdomain α) to dark (subdomain γ) colors along the polypeptide chain from the N to the C termini in domains 1 and 2. α-Helices and 310 helices are colored red.

https://openalex.org/W2018693309,"Cell culture systems have demonstrated a role for cytoplasmic fatty acid-binding proteins (FABP) in lipid metabolism, although a similar function in intact animals is unknown. We addressed this issue using heart fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP) gene-ablated mice. H-FABP gene ablation reduced total heart fatty acid uptake 40 and 52% for [1-14C]16:0 and [1-14C]20:4n-6 compared with controls, respectively. Similarly, the amount of fatty acid found in the aqueous fraction was reduced 40 and 52% for [1-14C]16:0 and [1-14C]20:4n-6, respectively. Less [1-14C]16:0 entered the triacylglycerol pool, with significant redistribution of fatty acid between the triacylglycerol pool and the total phospholipid pool. Less [1-14C]20:4n-6 entered each lipid pool measured, but these changes did not alter the distribution of tracer among these pools. In gene-ablated mice, significantly more [1-14C]16:0 was targeted to choline and ethanolamine glycerophospholipids, whereas more [1-14C]20:4n-6 was targeted to the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) pool. H-FABP gene ablation significantly increased PtdIns mass 1.4-fold but reduced PtdIns 20:4n-6 mass 30%. Consistent with a reported effect of FABP on plasmalogen mass, ethanolamine plasmalogen mass was reduced 30% in gene-ablated mice. Further, 20:4n-6 mass was reduced in each of the three other major phospholipid classes, suggesting H-FABP has a role in maintaining steady-state 20:4n-6 mass in heart. In summary, H-FABP was important for heart fatty acid uptake and targeting of fatty acids to specific heart lipid pools as well as for maintenance of phospholipid pool mass and acyl chain composition.

Res. 1999; 85: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) provides a useful tool to determine the role of H-FABP in fatty acid uptake, trafficking, and metabolism. H-FABP is a 15-kDa cytosolic protein found in heart, muscle, and lactating mammary gland (3Zschiesche W. Kleine A.H. Spitzer E. Veerkamp J.H. Glatz J.F.C. Histochemistry. 1995; 103: 147-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 4Glatz J.F.C. van der Vusse G. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1989; 88: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). A unique promoter region appears to account for the specific tissue localization of H-FABP expression (5Qian Q. Kuo L. Yu Y.-T. Rottman J.N. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 276-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent diabetes, H-FABP expression is increased (6Glatz J.F.C. van Breda E. Keizer H.A. de Jong Y.F. Lakey J.R.T. Rajotte R.V. Thompson A. van der Vusse G.J. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Physiol. 2003; 283: E923-E930Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role in mediating heart fatty acid uptake and utilization in diabetes. H-FABP binds fatty acids with a high affinity and can transport fatty acids between vesicles via a collisional mechanism involving the direct interaction between H-FABP and membrane for fatty acid binding to occur (8Kim H.-K. Storch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20051-20056Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the role of H-FABP in heart lipid metabolism in intact animals is poorly understood.H-FABP gene-ablated mice demonstrate a normal phenotype with regard to fertility, sex ratio, and weight gain (1Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). However, these mice develop cardiac hypertrophy with increasing age as demonstrated by a 38-fold increase in atrial natriuretic peptide, an enlargement of myocyte nuclei, and an increase in mean muscle fiber diameter (1Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). A qualitative study in vivo demonstrated that H-FABP gene-ablated mice had a dramatic decrease in the uptake of 125I-labeled 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3(R,S)-methylpentadecanoic acid, a nonmetabolizable fatty acid analog (1Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In isolated myocytes from H-FABP gene-ablated mice, there is a dramatic 45% decrease in palmitic acid (16:0) uptake and utilization (2Schaap F.G. Binas B. Danneberg H. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and a concomitant increase in glucose utilization (1Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 2Schaap F.G. Binas B. Danneberg H. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Despite the increase in glucose uptake and decrease in fatty acid uptake, there is no apparent increase in glucose transporter (GLUT4) expression or levels (2Schaap F.G. Binas B. Danneberg H. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Further, there are no compensatory increases in the expression of or levels of other FABP types or of putative membrane-associated fatty acid transport proteins (2Schaap F.G. Binas B. Danneberg H. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The apparent number of mitochondria is the same between groups, and the capacity for β-oxidation is maintained in mitochondria isolated from gene-ablated mice (2Schaap F.G. Binas B. Danneberg H. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Hence, these results indicate that the heart mitochondria are functionally normal, yet there is a severe reduction in the uptake of saturated fatty acids; however, the effect on polyunsaturated fatty acids involved in lipid-mediated signal transduction is unknown.FABP expression in cellular systems is associated with an increase in phospholipid mass and alterations in phospholipid acyl chain composition. Liver (L)-FABP and intestinal (I)-FABP expression increased basal total phospholipid mass 1.7- and 1.3-fold in L-cell fibroblasts, respectively (9Murphy E.J. Prows D. Stiles T. Schroeder F. Lipids. 2000; 35: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Jolly C.A. Murphy E.J. Duttaroy A.K. Spener F. Cellular Proteins and Their Fatty Acids in Health and Disease. Wiley-VCH Press, Darmstadt, Germany2002Google Scholar). Both of these FABP increased the mass of individual phospholipid classes as well as increasing the mass of the plasmalogen subclasses of the ethanolamine and choline glycerophospholipids (9Murphy E.J. Prows D. Stiles T. Schroeder F. Lipids. 2000; 35: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Overall, expression of these two FABP resulted in an increase in the degree of unsaturation in phospholipid acyl chain composition (9Murphy E.J. Prows D. Stiles T. Schroeder F. Lipids. 2000; 35: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Hence, FABP expression can alter steady-state phospholipid mass and acyl chain composition, suggesting a role in cellular lipid metabolism beyond an increase in fatty acid uptake.Previous studies using isolated hearts and myocytes suggestedthat20:4n-6isesterifiedintolipidpoolsinaconcentration-dependent manner (11Hohl C.M. Rosen P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 921: 356-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 12Saddik M. Lopaschuk G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1086: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This conclusion resulted in confusion regarding 20:4n-6 targeting under physiological plasma fatty acid concentrations. This problem is avoided by infusing animals with a high specific activity radiotracer in which unlabeled plasma fatty acid levels are unaltered (13Freed L.M. Wakabayashi S. Bell J.M. Rapoport S.I. Brain Res. 1994; 645: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14Murphy E.J. Rosenberger T.A. Patrick C.B. Rapoport S.I. Lipids. 2000; 35: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Using these conditions, we previously reported that [1-14C]20:4n-6 is esterified primarily into rat heart phospholipids, whereas [1-14C]16:0 is preferentially esterified into heart triacylglycerols and found in the aqueous fraction representing by-products of β-oxidation (14Murphy E.J. Rosenberger T.A. Patrick C.B. Rapoport S.I. Lipids. 2000; 35: 891-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Hence, under physiologically relevant fatty acid concentrations, such as those used in this study, there is a divergent processing of 20:4n-6 and 16:0, resulting in targeting to two vastly different heart lipid pools. This targeting for 20:4n-6 is consistent with its use in heart lipid-mediated signal transduction (15Liu S.J. McHowat J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H1462-H1472PubMed Google Scholar, 16McHowat J.

McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and 16:0 in isolated myocytes (1Binas B. Danneberg H. McWhir J. Mullins L. Clark A.J. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 2Schaap F.G. Binas B. Danneberg H. van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F.C. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), its quantitative significance, fatty acid selectivity, and potential ability to target fatty acids to different cellular fatty acid pools in vivo remain unknown. Further, it is well known that FABP expression in cells can increase cellular phospholipid mass (9Murphy E.J. Prows D. Stiles T. Schroeder F. Lipids. 2000; 35: 729-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and FABP can increase phospholipid biosynthesis in vitro, yet the ability of FABP to have a similar effect in vivo is unknown. To better address the potential role for H-FABP in heart fatty acid uptake and trafficking, gene-ablated mice were infused with either [1-14C]16:0 or [1-14C]-20:4n-6 (170 μCi/kg), and heart fatty acid uptake and disposition were determined using standard lipid analytical techniques. Alterations in steady-state phospholipid mass and phospholipid acyl-chain composition were addressed using standard lipid analytical techniques. We found a significant reduction in 16:0 uptake but a surprisingly robust decrease in 20:4n-6 uptake, indicative of a previously unknown role for H-FABP in polyunsaturated fatty acid uptake in the heart. H-FABP also appears to be important in the trafficking of both fatty acids to cellular lipid pools in gene-ablated mice; more 20:4n-6 was targeted to phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), consistent with the increased mass in PtdIns in the gene-ablated mice, suggesting that H-FABP may have a role in directing 20:4n-6 to specific phospholipid classes.MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—Male mice (25–30 g) were obtained from the Cardiovascular Research Institute Maastricht (Maastricht, The Netherlands) and were maintained on a standard laboratory chow diet and water ad libitum. The ages for the mice used in this study were between 9–15 months in both control and H-FABP gene-ablated mice. There were no correlations between age and any of the lipid parameters measured in either group. This study was conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (National Institutes of Health publication 80-23) and under an animal protocol approved by the IACUC at the University of North Dakota (Protocol 0110-1).Mouse Surgery—After the mouse was anesthetized with halothane (1–3%), their femoral artery and vein were catheterized with polyethylene tubing (PE-10). The wound area was anesthetized with xylocaine (1%) and closed using standard surgical staples. The hind quarters of the mouse was immobilized by taping the hind legs and hind quarters to a wooden block, and the mice were maintained postoperatively in a temperature-controlled environment for 3–4 h.Tracer Preparation—The [1-14C]16:0 and [1-14C]20:4n-6 were synthesized by Moravek Biochemical (Brea, CA). Radiotracer (Moravek Biochemical) was prepared by taking an aliquot of tracer in ethanol and evaporating the ethanol under a constant stream of N2 at 50 °C. Prior to use, radiotracer purity was assessed by gas liquid chromatography and was found to be >97% pure. The fatty acid tracer was solubilized in 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) buffer containing “essentially fatty acid-free” bovine serum albumin (50 mg/ml; Sigma). Solubilization was facilitated by sonication in a bath sonicator for 45 min at 45 °C. The appropriate amount of radiotracer was prepared for each mouse using the mouse's weight based upon the infusion parameters of 170 μCi/kg (13Freed L.M. Wakabayashi S. Bell J.M. Rapoport S.I. Brain Res. 1994; 645: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Infusion (Intravenous)—Awake, adult male mice were infused with 170 μCi/kg of either [1-14C]16:0 or [1-14C]20:4n-6 into the femoral vein over 10 min at a constant rate of 30 μl/min to achieve steady-state plasma radioactivity. Prior to and during the experimental period, arterial blood samples (∼20 μl) were taken to determine plasma radioactivity. Following infusion, each mouse was killed using pentobarbital (100 mg/kg, intravenously). Its heart was rapidly removed, bisected, rinsed free of exogenous blood, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The time from pentobarbital injection and freezing was 40 ± 10 s. All tissue was stored at –80 °C until used.Plasma Extraction—Arterial blood samples, taken at fixed times during the infusion period, were stored for up to 10 min on ice before separating the plasma by centrifugation with a Beckman Microfuge (Fullerton, CA). Plasma lipids were then extracted by transferring a 10-μl aliquot of plasma into a tube containing 2 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and then mixing it by vortexing (22Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of 0.4 ml of 0.9% KCl to these tubes resulted in two phases. These phases were thoroughly mixed and then separated overnight in a –20 °C freezer. The upper phase was removed, and the lipid-containing lower phase was rinsed with 0.43 ml of theoretical upper phase to remove any aqueous soluble contaminants (22Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The radioactivity in the upper phase was determined using a Beckman LS5000 CE liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Lower phase radioactivity was assessed in a portion of the lower phase using a Beckman LS5000 CE liquid scintillation counter.Blood Extraction—Following the procedure described above for plasma, whole blood was extracted to correct for radioactivity contributed by residual blood left in the tissue. For the heart, the residual blood left in the heart tissue was estimated at 22% (23Smith B.S. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1970; 27: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Tissue Lipid Extraction—Frozen tissue was pulverized under liquid nitrogen temperatures. Lipids from the tissue powder were extracted in a Tenbroeck tissue homogenizer using a two-phase system (22Folch J. Lees M. Sloane-Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the tissue mass (g) was multiplied by a correction factor of 1.28 to convert it to an equivalent value expressed in ml (24Radin N.S. Boulton A.A. Baker G.B. Horrocks L.A. Neuromethods 7: Lipids and Related Compounds. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1988: 1-61Google Scholar). This value represents 1 volume. The pulverized tissue was placed in the homogenizer, and 17 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) was added. Tissue was homogenized until there was a fine particulate-like powder. The solvent was removed, and the homogenizer rinsed with 3 volumes of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The rinse was added to the original sample, and 4 volumes of 0.9% KCl solution was added to this combined lipid extract. After vigorous mixing, phase separation was facilitated by centrifugation as described above. The upper phase and proteinaceous interface was removed and saved in a 20-ml glass scintillation vial. The lower organic phase was washed twice with 2 ml of theoretical upper phase, with phase separation facilitated by centrifugation between washes. The washes were removed and combined with the previously removed upper phase. The washed lower phase was dried under a stream of nitrogen and the lipids redissolved in 1 ml of n-hexane/2-propanol (3:2, v/v) containing 5.5% H2O.Aqueous Fraction—Radioactivity in the aqueous fraction from the tissue extraction, including the theoretical upper phase from the two wash steps, was measured using liquid scintillation counting. Radioactivity was determined after the addition of 10 ml of Scintiverse II BD (Fisher) using a Beckman LS5000 CE liquid scintillation counter. The addition of the aqueous material to the scintillation mixture did not adversely affect the counter efficiency.Thin Layer Chromatography—Phospholipids and neutral lipids were separated by TLC. For each separation, 100 μl of sample was spotted onto a TLC plate. Phospholipids were separated on heat-activated Whatman silica gel-60 plates (20 × 20 cm, 250 μm) and developed in chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:37.5:3.5:2 by volume) (25Jolly C.A. Hubbell T. Behnke W.D. Schroeder F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 112-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). This method separates all major phospholipids. Neutral lipids were separated on heat-activated Whatman silica gel-60 plates (20 × 20 cm, 250 μm) and developed in petroleum ether/diethyl ether/acetic acid (75:25:1.3 by volume) (26Marcheselli V.L. Scott B.L. Reddy T.S. Bazan N.G. Boulton A.A. Baker G.B. Horrocks L.A. Neuromethods 7: Lipids and Related Compounds. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1988: 83-110Google Scholar). This solvent system resolves cholesteryl esters, diacylglycerols, nonesterified fatty acids, and triacylglycerols. Lipid fractions were identified using authentic standards (Doosan-Serday (Englewood Cliffs, NJ) and NuChek Prep (Elysian, MN)).Individual Lipid Class Masses—Phospholipid mass was determined by assaying for lipid phosphorous content of individual lipid classes separated by TLC as described above (27Rouser G. Siakotos A. Fleischer S. Lipids. 1969; 1: 85-86Crossref Scopus (1313) Google Scholar). Cholesterol and cholesteryl ester mass was assayed using an iron binding assay after separation by TLC as described above (28Hara A. Radin N.S. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 90: 420-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (2037) Google Scholar).Plasmalogen Mass—The plasmalogen mass was determined following separation of individual phospholipid classes in the heart lipid extracts by high performance liquid chromatography (29Dugan L.L. Demediuk P. Pendley II, C.E. Horrocks L.A. J. Chromatogr. 1986; 378: 317-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One-half of the choline glycerophospholipid (ChoGpl) and of the ethanolamine glycerophospholipid (EtnGpl) fractions were dried under nitrogen and subjected to mild acidic hydrolysis followed by separation using high pressure liquid chromatography (30Murphy E.J. Stephens R. Jurkowitz-Alexander M. Horrocks L.A. Lipids. 1993; 28: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The proportion of plasmalogen in this separation was used to calculate plasmalogen mass using the EtnGpl, and ChoGpl masses were determined by TLC as reported above.Phospholipid Acyl Chain Composition—The fatty acid composition of the PtdIns, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), ChoGpl, and EtnGpl was determined following transesterification in 0.5 m KOH in methanol to form the fatty acid methyl ester (31Brockerhoff H. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 35: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Individual fatty acids were separated by gas liquid chromatography using an SP-2330 column (0.32-mm inner diameter × 30-m length) and a trace gas liquid chromatograph (ThermoElectron, Austin, TX) equipped with dual autosamplers and dual flame ionization detectors. Fatty acids were quantified using a standard curve from commercially purchased standards (NuChek Prep), and 17:0 was the internal standard.Liquid Scintillation Counting—Bands corresponding to the appropriate lipid fractions were scraped into 20-ml liquid scintillation vials, and 0.5 ml of H2O was added, followed by 10 ml of Scintiverse BD (Fisher). After mixing, the samples were quantified by liquid scintillation counting at least 1 h after the addition of the liquid scintillation mixture.Calculations—Integrated areas for the plasma radioactivity curves were determined using the trapezoidal method (Sigma Plot, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Total radioactivity for each individual heart fraction was normalized to the wet weight (g wet weight) and divided by the integrated area of plasma radioactivity. This calculation essentially normalizes the tissue radioactivity to the exposure of plasma tracer. The resulting coefficient is called the unilateral incorporation coefficient or k*, with values expressed as s–1. Hence, the k* represents the radioactivity of each fraction normalized to the amount of radioactivity in the plasma to which the tissue was exposed. The following equation was used to calculate the unilateral incorporation coefficient, k*=c*tissue/∫0Tc*plasmadteq.1 where k* represents the incorporation coefficient of tracer into a heart compartment, c*tissue is tracer radioactivity in the heart compartment, c*plasma is tracer radioactivity in the plasma, and T is time of tissue sampling.Statistics—Statistical analysis was done using Instat2 from Graph-Pad (San Diego, CA). Statistical significance was assessed using a unpaired, two-way, Student's t test, with p < 0.05 considered to be statistically significant.RESULTSPlasma Curves—The plasma curves for [1-14C]16:0- and [1-14C]20:4n-6-infused mice reached a steady state between 2 and 4 min following the start of infusion (Fig. 1). For [1-14C]-16:0-infused mice, the average integrated plasma curve area was significantly different between groups (p < 0.05), with values of 943 ± 61 and 1172 ± 127 nCi × min–1 × ml–1 for control and gene-ablated mice, respectively. For [1-14C]20:4n-6-infused mice, the average integrated plasma curve area was 1457 ± 484 and 1420 ± 286 nCi × min–1 × ml–1 for control and gene-ablated mice, respectively.Heart Fatty Acid Uptake—Heart radiotracer uptake was normalized to the integrated area under the curve and expressed as the incorporation coefficient, k*. For [1-14C]16:0-infused mice, there was a significant reduction in the k* for the total, aqueous, and organic fractions (Fig. 2). The total uptake was significantly reduced 40% in gene-ablated mice, with a reduction of 40% in the aqueous fraction and a 24% reduction in the organic fraction. Calculating the percentage of the radiotracer in the plasma extracted by the heart, 6.2 ± 0.4% of the [1-14C]16:0 was extracted from the plasma in control mice, whereas 4.2 ± 0.9% was extracted from the plasma in gene-ablated mice. Hence, two different measures of fatty acid up-take demonstrate a 35–40% reduction in 16:0 uptake in gene-ablated mice.Fig. 2Uptake of [1-14C]16:0 or [1-14C]20:4n-6 into heart tissue from control (▪) and H-FABP gene-ablated (□) mice expressed as total uptake or uptake into the aqueous and organic fractions. All values are expressed as k* (s–1) and were corrected for radioactivity associated with the residual blood left in the heart tissue. Values represent mean ± S.D. (n = 5–6). *, statistical significance from control mice, p < 0.05.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)For [1-14C]20:4n-6-infused mice, there was also a significant reduction in k* for the total, aqueous, and organic fractions (Fig. 2). In all cases, the values were decreased 52%, indicating no preferential reduction in the tracer entering either the aqueous or organic fractions. For control mice, 14.2 ± 3.0% of the [1-14C]20:4n-6 was extracted from the plasma, whereas 6.6 ± 1.2% was extracted from the plasma in gene-ablated mice. Thus, two different measures of fatty acid uptake demonstrate a greater than 50% reduction in 20:4n-6 uptake into heart by H-FABP gene ablation.Distribution of Fatty Acid into Metabolic Compartments— The effects of H-FABP gene ablation on fatty acid distribution into the aqueous and organic fractions was determined. For [1-14C]16:0-infused mice, there was a significant redistribution of fatty acid into the organic fraction relative to the aqueous fraction in H-FABP gene-ablated mice. Nearly 12% more 16:0 was targeted for esterification into stable lipid compartments found in the organic fraction than to the aqueous compartment in gene-ablated mice. For [1-14C]20:4n-6-infused mice, there was no redistribution of 20:4n-6 targeted to the organic or aqueous fraction between groups. Thus, H-FABP gene ablation only resulted in an alteration in targeting of 16:0 between the aqueous and organic fractions.Fatty Acid Targeting into Esterified Lipid Compartments— The incorporation and distribution of tracer in the esterified neutral lipid and phospholipid fractions was determined (Fig. 3). For [1-14C]16:0-infused mice, there was a significant reduction (52%) in the incorporation of tracer into the neutral lipid compartment in gene-ablated mice, whereas there was no alteration in the incorporation of tracer into the phospholipid compartment (Fig. 3A). This resulted in a significant redistribution of tracer between the neutral lipids and phospholipid compartments, with a net increase in the tracer targeted for esterification into the total phospholipid pool (Fig. 3B). For [1-14C]20:4n-6-infused mice, there was a significant reduction in the incorporation of tracer into both the esterified neutral lipid compartment (40%) and phospholipid compartment (40%) (Fig. 3A). Hence, there was no significant redistribution of [1-14C]20:4n-6 between the esterified neutral lipid and phospholipid compartments (Fig. 3B). Thus, H-FABP gene ablation resulted in a significant decrease in f"

Autophagy is a starvation-induced bulk flow transport pathway delivering cytosolic material, including whole organelles for breakdown to the lysosome (vacuole) (1Thumm M. Mol.

Autophagy recycles amino acids and provides the cells with energy, thus helping them to survive when external nutrient supplies are limited. The autophagic pathway is well conserved between mammals, plants, and yeasts. Over the last decade, pace-setting work in Saccharomyces cerevisiae led to the identification of more than 20 autophagy (ATG) genes (5Klionsky D.J. Cregg J.M. Dunn W.A. Emr S.D. Sakai Y.

The outer membrane of the autophagosomes then fuses with the vacuole, and still membrane-bound autophagic bodies are released into the vacuolar lumen, where they are broken down.In S. cerevisiae, proaminopeptidase I (pAPI), a resident vacuolar proteinase, has been shown to be selectively targeted to the vacuole via autophagy using the receptor-like Atg19 protein (21Scott S.V. Guan J. Hutchins M.U. Kim J. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1131-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 22Leber R. Silles E. Sandoval I.V. Mazon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29210-29217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Once in the vacuole pAPI is proteolytically matured. Under nutrient-rich conditions, when autophagy is not induced, pAPI uses the Cvt pathway as an alternate route to the vacuole. The Cvt pathway and autophagy are morphologically very similar, but the Cvt transport intermediates, the double-layered Cvt vesicles, are smaller in size compared with autophagosomes and do not include cytosolic material. Autophagy and the Cvt pathway both start at the PAS and share most of the components needed for the biogenesis of the transport vesicles. At the PAS, a set of commonly used proteins has been identified: (i) a protein complex containing the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Vps34; (ii) the integral membrane protein Atg9; (iii) a covalently linked protein conjugate of Atg5 and Atg12, generated by the action of a ubiquitin-like protein conjugation system; (iv) Atg8 covalently linked to phosphatidylethanolamine (Atg8-PE), which is generated by a second ubiquitin-like conjugation system; and (v) a protein complex containing Atg13 and the serine/threonine protein kinase Atg1, which is involved in switching between the Cvt pathway and autophagy.Besides these shared components, an increasing number of proteins such as Vac8 (23Scott S.V. Nice D.C. Nau J.J. Weisman L.S. Kamada Y. Keizer-Gunnink I. Funakoshi T. Veenhuis M. Ohsumi Y. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 761-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) have been identified, which specifically affect only the Cvt pathway. Since all of the specific components, besides the pAPI-receptor Atg19, affect biogenesis of the Cvt vesicles, the main mechanistic differences between the Cvt pathway and autophagy are expected during biogenesis of their transport vesicles. Getting more insight into the differences between the Cvt pathway and autophagy should therefore also improve our understanding of the sophisticated mechanisms used during the formation of these unconventional double membrane-layered vesicles.Previously, we identified the yeast Atg21 as a component essential for maturation of pAPI under conditions where the Cvt pathway is active. Starvation induction of autophagy bypassed the defect in pAPI maturation in atg21Δ cells, pointing to a specific function of Atg21 in the Cvt pathway (27Barth H. Meiling-Wesse K. Epple U.D. Thumm M. FEBS Lett. 2002; 512: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae cells contain two further proteins homologous to Atg21. One of these proteins, Atg18, has been shown to be essential for formation of both autophagosomes and Cvt vesicles (28Barth H. Meiling-Wesse K. Epple U.D. Thumm M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 508: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 29Guan J. Stromhaug P.E. George M.D. Habibzadegah-Tari P. Bevan A. Dunn Jr., W.A. Klionsky D.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3821-3838Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The third Atg21 yeast homologue, Ygr223, has not been tested so far for its implication in either autophagy or the Cvt pathway. Atg21 is ∼20% identical with Atg18, but whereas Atg18 affects both autophagy and the Cvt pathway, Atg21 is only essential for the Cvt pathway. This makes the two proteins ideal objects for studying the mechanistic features of both pathways.Extending our initial studies on the function of Atg21, we here report localization of Atg21-YFP to some perivacuolar punctae. When multiple vacuoles are present in a cell, Atg21-YFP is recruited to the vertices of the vacuole junctions. Atg21 shares this localization pattern with components of the Vps class C(HOPS) (homotypic fusion and vacuolar protein sorting) complex. Our findings show that in contrast to ypt7Δ cells, proaminopeptidase I is not membrane-enclosed in Cvt vesicles in growing atg21Δ ypt7Δ cells. Furthermore, a lack of Atg21 prevents normal recruitment of Atg8 to the preautophagosomal structure and consistently reduced its lipidation significantly.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and PlasmidsFor a list of strains, see Table I.

The mean area of autophagosome profiles was estimated by point counting from photographs taken at × 12,000 magnification.Fluorescence and light microscopy was done using a Zeiss Axioscope2 microscope with an Axiocam digital camera.RESULTSThe Homologous Proteins Atg18 and Atg21 Play Distinct Roles in Autophagy and the Cvt Pathway—Atg21 has two yeast homologues, Atg18 (∼20% identity) and the protein of so far unknown function, Ygr223c (∼14% identity). We here analyzed Ygr223c for defects in autophagy or the Cvt pathway. As shown in Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4, complete maturation of pAPI in starved and nonstarved ygr223cΔ cells does not suggest defects in the autophagic or Cvt pathway. Also, starved ygr223cΔ atg21Δ double mutant cells did not show an additive defect in the autophagic pathway (Fig. 1A, lane 1).We next generated 2-μm plasmids expressing HA-tagged versions of Atg18 and Atg21 under control of their respective endogenous promotors and confirmed their expression and biological activity in rescuing pAPI maturation (Fig. 1B, lanes 2-5). With ∼20% identity, Atg18 and Atg21 show significant homologies over their entire length, but overexpression of Atg18-HA in atg21Δ and of Atg21-HA in atg18Δ cells did not rescue the defects in the Cvt pathway or autophagy (Fig. 1B). This suggests that both proteins play distinct, nonredundant roles.For a quantitative measurement of the autophagic rate, Noda et al. (38Noda T. Matsuura A. Wada Y. Ohsumi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) introduced a system based on expression of a truncated version of the alkaline phosphatase Pho8. This truncated enzymatically inactive Pho8Δ60 lacks the endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence and therefore stays in the cytoplasm. After autophagic transport to the vacuole, proteolytic processing of Pho8Δ60 generates enzymatically active phosphatase, whose activity can be measured. After chromosomal deletion of PHO8, we expressed Pho8Δ60 in atg21Δ cells and measured the generation of phosphatase activity during starvation in nitrogen-free medium. Compared with wild-type cells, the autophagic rate in atg21Δ cells was reduced to 35% (Fig. 2A). This indicates that autophagy proceeds in the absence of Atg21, but at a reduced rate. Consistently, maturation of pAPI is not complete in atg21Δ cells after only a short time of nitrogen limitation (Fig. 2B, lanes 4-6).Fig. 2Atg21-deleted cells show a reduced rate of autophagy.A, the rate of autophagy was measured quantitatively in atg21Δ pho8Δ cells expressing Pho8Δ60 from a plasmid. In wild-type cells, enzymatically inactive Pho8Δ60 is transported to the vacuole via autophagy, where it is proteolytically activated. Aliquots were taken, and the enzymatic activity was measured at the indicated times after shifting the cells to the starvation medium SD(-N). The enzymatic activity of the wild type was set to 100%. atg15Δ cells are known to be defective in autophagy. wt, wild type.

In this study, we address the critical biochemical and structural relevance of zinc ions in rhodopsin and examine whether zinc deficiency can lead to rhodopsin dysfunction. We report the identification of a high-affinity zinc coordination site within the transmembrane domain of rhodopsin, coordinated by the side chains of two highly conserved residues, Glu122 in transmembrane helix III and His211 in transmembrane helix V. We also demonstrate that this zinc coordination is critical for rhodopsin folding, 11-cis-retinal binding, and the stability of the chromophore-receptor interaction, defects of which are observed in retinitis pigmentosa. Furthermore, a cluster of retinitis pigmentosa mutations is localized within and around this zinc binding site. Based on these studies, we believe that improvement in zinc binding to rhodopsin at this site within the transmembrane domain may be a pharmacological approach for the treatment of select retinitis pigmentosa mutations.

Several neurodegenerative disorders, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, share a common pathogenesis involving the misfolding and aggregation of specific proteins. Mounting evidence has demonstrated the direct binding of zinc (Zn2+) to the β-amyloid (Alzheimer disease), α-synuclein (Parkinson disease), superoxide dismutase (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis), and prion (transmissible spongiform encephalopathies) proteins, linking either the gain or loss of Zn2+ binding to the progression of these severe protein misfolding disorders.

Thus, both zinc deficiencies and excesses can lead to neurodegenerative diseases. In the G protein-coupled photoreceptor rhodopsin, there have been over 100 distinct, heritable mutations identified, many of which induce an altered protein conformation, misfolding, aggregation, and cell death, followed by the clinical manifestation of the retinal neurodegenerative disorder retinitis pigmentosa (9Stojanovic A.

Upon analysis of the 2.8-Å resolution crystal structure of rhodopsin (22Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M.

A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), we identified three putative zinc (Zn2+) ions bound to each rhodopsin monomer (Zn2+ ions 1, 2, and 3 on rhodopsin monomer A; Zn2+ ions 4, 5, and 6 on rhodopsin monomer B) with a seventh Zn2+ ion present at the interface between the two monomers of the rhodopsin dimer. We now report that the Zn2+ coordination site formed by residues within the rhodopsin transmembrane domain is physiologically relevant and critical to the structure and function of rhodopsin. Furthermore, we have confirmed that this site is specific for Zn2+versus other similar divalent metals. This Zn2+ coordination site in rhodopsin lies within the 11-cis-retinal binding pocket (in the TM domain), 8 Å from the β-ionone ring of 11-cis-retinal, coordinated by the transmembrane amino acids Glu122 (TM III; side chain carbonyl), Met163 (TM IV; backbone carbonyl), and His211 (TM V; imidazole side chain). Through inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), fluorescent detection of Zn2+ and site-directed mutagenesis, we confirm that Zn2+ is bound to rhodopsin and that the coordination site formed by residues Glu122 and His211 is a high-affinity zinc coordination site. In contrast to a low-affinity, solvent-accessible Zn2+ coordination site that destabilizes rhodopsin, the coordination of Zn2+ within the transmembrane domain is critical for dark state rhodopsin stability, 11-cis- retinal binding, and may play a vital role in transition to the active metarhodopsin II state. Preparation of Rhodopsin Protein Samples—Amino acid substitutions were introduced into the synthetic rhodopsin gene through PCR mutagenesis, as described previously (25Stojanovic A. Hwang I. Khorana H.G. Hwa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39020-39028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with pMT4 vectors carrying the opsin genes. Cells were harvested and opsins regenerated with 11-cis-retinal and rhodopsin proteins purified by immunoaffinity chromatography. In experiments where rhodopsin was treated with EDTA (Sigma), CaCl2 (Sigma), CoCl2 (Sigma), CuCl2 (Sigma), or ZnCl2 (Fisher Scientific) or examined under various pH values, the respective phosphate-buffered saline buffer, with those changes, was prepared and utilized throughout the protein purification process. ROS (rod outer segments) from bovine retinas was a kind gift from Dr. Phillip Reeves (M.I.T.). The presence of rhodopsin protein, both from COS-1 cells and from ROS, was determined through UV-visible spectroscopy (500 nm absorbance) and Western blot analysis (25Stojanovic A. Hwang I. Khorana H.G. Hwa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39020-39028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). UV-visible Absorption Spectroscopy—UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Life Sciences λ-40 UV-visible spectrophotometer at 2 or 25 °C (25Stojanovic A. Hwang I. Khorana H.G. Hwa J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39020-39028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin thermal stability was determined by monitoring the decay of the 500 nm absorbance at a constant temperature of 50 °C. Protein samples were allowed to equilibrate (2–5 min) to 50 °C prior to acquiring absorption spectra. Absorption spectra were obtained at 5-min intervals, until complete disappearance of the 500 nm absorbance. Initial values of the 500 nm absorbance were normalized between experiments to account for base-line shifts and protein concentration. Fluorescent Zn2+Detection—Purified rhodopsin protein or rhodopsin from ROS was incubated with a 1 μm concentration of the fluorescent Zn2+ indicator, FluoZin™-3 (Molecular Probes). Samples were excited in a CytoFluor II spectrofluorimeter (Applied Biosystems) at a wavelength of 485 nm (bandwidth of 20 nm), and the emission was measured at a wavelength of 508 nm (bandwidth of 20 nm). This was within the active range of FluoZin-3 (optimal excitation at 494 nm and emission at 515 nm). A standard curve of Zn2+ binding to FluoZin-3 was determined by the addition of 10-fold differing concentrations of Zn2+ to FluoZin-3 (six Zn2+ concentrations from 1.0 × 10-10m to 1.0 × 10-5m; n = 6). To exclude fluorescence due to binding of alternate cations, we measured fluorescence of FluoZin-3 upon the addition of Ca2+ (CaCl2). To determine background Zn2+, the same concentration of FluoZin-3 was incubated with each solution in which rhodopsin was solubilized and purified. Rhodopsin was incubated with FluoZin-3 and assayed for fluorescence in either the dark or activated state. Three fluorescence scans were obtained and averaged for each cycle. For photoactivation, protein samples were illuminated for 30 s with a 150-watt fiber optic light. These samples were then returned to the dark for the remainder of the experiment. ICP-MS—Purified rhodopsin protein was dissolved in a HNO3 solution and digested in an MARS-5 microwave (300 watts for 10 min). ICP-MS analyses were performed on an Agilent 7500s ICP-MS equipped with an Agilent High Solids nebulizer. The solution was diluted 4- and 10-fold with deionized water and analyzed for zinc. Three isotopes of zinc (66Zn, 67Zn, and 68Zn) were averaged for measurements and calculations. To check for contamination of the digestion procedure and sample manipulation, a blank solution was prepared and carried through each set of analyses. Gallium was used as internal standard for the determination of zinc. Computer Modeling—The rhodopsin crystal structure (PDB ID: 1L9H) (24Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar) was visualized with the Swiss PDB Viewer computer program (GlaxoSmithKline, Geneva, Switzerland) (26Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9499) Google Scholar). Putative H-bonds were depicted in green. Zn2+ ions were depicted as gray spheres. Data Analysis—Values for all experiments are expressed as mean ± S.E. All means and S.E. were calculated from at least three separate experiments using separate protein preparations. K rate constants, half-lives, and FluoZin-3 Zn2+ binding rates were acquired with nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism® software. A 95% confidence interval was used for all curve-fitting procedures using GraphPad Prism. Where applicable, data were determined to be statistically significant using the unpaired t test (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). Through examination of the rhodopsin crystal structure (PDB ID: 1L9H) (24Okada T. Fujiyoshi Y. Silow M. Navarro J. Landau E.M. Shichida Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 5982-5987Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), we identified four putative Zn2+ coordination sites in each monomer of rhodopsin (Fig. 1A, Zn2+1, Zn2+2, Zn2+3, and Zn2+4). Interestingly, while many metal binding sites occur in solvent-exposed regions, there was a predicted Zn2+3 coordination site within the TM 11-cis-retinal binding pocket of rhodopsin, 8 Å from the β-ionone ring of 11-cis-retinal (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, we had previously identified a large clustering of retinitis pigmentosa mutations in this same region (9Stojanovic A. Hwa J. Receptors Channels. 2002; 8: 33-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). As the rhodopsin crystallization procedure required supraphysiological concentrations of Zn2+ (∼100 mm), it was crucial to determine which Zn2+ coordination sites were physiologically and biochemically relevant and to determine the role played by the coordination of such Zn2+ ions. Determination of Zn2+ binding (ICP-MS and FluoZin-3) was followed by Zn2+ treatment (pre- and postprotein purification), biochemical removal of the solvent exposed Zn2+ binding sites (pH and EDTA), and mutagenic removal of the Zn2+ from the transmembrane site. These assays in combination with the rhodopsin crystal structure confirmed a structurally important, buried, high-affinity Zn2+ coordination site with the rhodopsin transmembrane domain and one or more low-affinity, solvent-exposed extracellular Zn2+ coordination sites. Using ICP-MS and fluorescent chelation of Zn2+, we confirmed that each rhodopsin molecule possessed at least one Zn2+ binding site. ICP-MS detected a total binding of 1.33 ± 0.27 Zn2+ ions per molecule of rhodopsin (Fig. 2A). We hypothesized complete occupancy of a high-affinity site (TM) and partial occupancy of low-affinity sites (extracellular). The Zn2+-dependent fluorophore, FluoZin-3, was used to quantitate low-affinity Zn2+ coordination in rhodopsin. FluoZin-3, a Zn2+ chelator, removes Zn2+ that are loosely bound to rhodopsin or free in solution. In Fig. 2B, we show a standard curve of Zn2+ binding to FluoZin-3. 10-Fold differences in Zn2+ concentrations were initially used (0.1 nm to 1 mm), followed by more detailed assessment of the linear portion of the curve to correlate fluorescence (508 nm) to Zn2+ concentration (inset, Fig. 2B). The calculated linear regression was determined to be Y (A.U.) = 428.7 X (log M) + 3150. This binding was shown to be specific for Zn2+, as incubation of FluoZin-3 with Ca2+ showed no significant fluorescence at equivalent concentrations of metal (Fig. 2B). Wild type rhodopsin was incubated with FluoZin-3 and assayed for fluorescence in the dark or upon photoactivation. In the absence of added Zn2+, FluoZin-3 chelated 0.21 ± 0.05 Zn2+ in the dark state and 0.57 ± 0.06 (p < 0.001) Zn2+ per rhodopsin in the photoactivated state (Fig. 2A). These data supported our hypothesis that one solvent exposed Zn2+ coordination site was partially bound and solvent exposed (easily chelatable by FluoZin-3), while a second, higher affinity Zn2+ coordination site (hypothesized to be the TM site) required photoactivation for chelation. We next examined Zn2+ affinity in a His211 → Cys mutant, which was predicted to reduce the affinity of Zn2+ at the Zn2+3 site natively coordinated by His211 and Glu122. FluoZin-3 chelated 0.40 ± 0.03 Zn2+ in the dark state, and the total zinc (1.37 ± 0.12 Zn2+ (p < 0.001)) was readily detected in the photoactivated state (Fig. 2A). Data from the wild type rhodopsin proteins supported that the Zn2+3 coordination site within the transmembrane domain was a physiologically relevant and high-affinity site; however, it became an exposed, lower affinity site upon photoactivation of rhodopsin. The His211 → Cys mutation reduced the affinity for Zn2+ within the transmembrane domain, allowing rapid total chelation upon photoactivation. To validate the physiological relevance of our findings, rhodopsin from ROS was analyzed using FluoZin-3. FluoZin-3 chelated 0.18 ± 0.01 Zn2+ in the dark state and 0.20 ± 0.01 Zn2+ per rhodopsin in the photoactivated state. While these data were not found to be statistically significant, a small light-sensitive trend similar to that observed with rhodopsin purified from COS-1 cells was consistently observed with rhodopsin from ROS. Nevertheless, these studies were able to confirm that the low-affinity portion of Zn2+ bound to rhodopsin was less than half a Zn2+ per rhodopsin molecule in both COS-1-expressed and ROS rhodopsin. As a result of the much higher stability of rhodopsin in ROS versus the dodecyl maltoside system used for rhodopsin expressed in COS-1 cells, the Zn2+ ion in the TM domain may be less accessible and detectable by FluoZin-3 upon light activation. Previous studies have used high concentrations of Zn2+ after rhodopsin purification thus accessing only the solvent accessible site. The TM domain is buried in a highly hydrophobic region and only exposed either during protein folding or upon photoactivation, as observed with FluoZin-3 chelatability. To further support our hypothesis that the Zn2+3 site and coordination of Zn2+ within the transmembrane domain is physiologically relevant, we both pretreated cells immediately following transfection (to promote access to the Zn2+3 coordination site during protein folding and processing) in addition to the conventionally used posttreatment procedure (after rhodopsin purification). Control samples were left untreated. UV-visible absorption spectra, obtained from the three rhodopsin populations (untreated, pretreated (50 μm ZnCl2 added to COS-1 cells), or posttreated (50 μm ZnCl2 added to purified protein)) show identical formation of a 500 nm peak (not shown). Upon photoactivation, all three populations also show identical formation of a 380 nm peak (not shown). Immunoblotting of rhodopsin showed that, at concentrations as high as 50 μm ZnCl2 in cell culture, no change in the expression or glycosylation of rhodopsin protein was observed (not shown). Thermal stability of the rhodopsin dark state at 50 °C was measured as a rate of decay of the 500 nm absorbance (i.e. release of 11-cis-retinal) over time. The wild type rhodopsin dark state decayed with a k rate constant of 0.024 ± 0.001 min-1 (Fig. 3A and Table I). Pretreatment of COS-1 cells with 10 μm ZnCl2 consistently and significantly slowed the rate of rhodopsin decay to 0.021 ± 0.001 min-1 (p < 0.05), while pretreatment with 50 μm ZnCl2 accelerated the decay rate to 0.030 ± 0.001 min-1 (p < 0.001; Fig. 3A and Table I). Posttreatment of rhodopsin protein with 10 μm ZnCl2 increased the decay rate to 0.027 ± 0.002 min-1, although t test analysis confirmed these data as not statistically significant. Posttreatment of rhodopsin protein with 50 μm ZnCl2 markedly and significantly increased the decay rate to 0.052 ± 0.006 min-1 (p < 0.01; Fig. 3A and Table I).Table IThermal stability calculations for rhodopsin and rhodopsin mutant proteins Statistical significance for treatments with zinc, EDTA, and altered pH is compared with non-treated sample of same rhodopsin population (i.e. wild type versus wild type + 1 mm EDTA).

Similar to ZnCl2, pretreatment with CaCl2, CoCl2, CuCl2 did not alter the 11-cis-retinal binding affinity of rhodopsin (data not shown). While ZnCl2 pretreatment and coordination of Zn2+ in the TM domain improved rhodopsin thermal stability (Table I and Fig. 3E), none of the additional metals showed such an effect. These studies confirm that the metal coordination site in the TM domain of rhodopsin is selective for Zn2+. Interestingly, 10 μm CuCl2 pretreatment led to significant destabilization. This may be related to extracellular solvent-exposed binding. These data suggested the presence of a stabilizing Zn2+-selective coordination site whose occupancy could be detected with a 10 μm ZnCl2 pretreatment and a destabilizing Zn2+ coordination site whose occupancy could be detected with a 50 μm ZnCl2 posttreatment. These findings also indicated that only ZnCl2 pretreatment, and not posttreatment of purified protein, allowed Zn2+ coordination at the stabilizing site. As we initially hypothesized, only the highly hydrophobic Zn2+3 coordination site (Fig. 1A) would be inaccessible to ZnCl2 posttreatment of purified rhodopsin. Altogether, our data suggested that the Zn2+3 coordination site within the transmembrane domain was a higher affinity, protein-stabilizing site, while one of the solvent-exposed (Fig. 1A, Zn2+1, Zn2+2, and Zn2+4) coordination sites was a lower affinity, protein-destabilizing site. To further support our hypothesis we used biochemical and mutagenic techniques to remove these coordination sites. To support the presence of a low-affinity, solvent-accessible, destabilizing site, we treated purified rhodopsin with EDTA, a strong Zn2+ chelator. We detected no fluorescence of FluoZin-3 in rhodopsin samples treated with 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), suggesting that EDTA chelated all Zn2+ that were solvent-accessible (not shown). Removal of Zn2+ from the solvent-accessible Zn2+ coordination site stabilized rhodopsin at 50 °C, as treatment with EDTA increased the thermal stability t½ of rhodopsin to greater than 60 min (Fig. 3B and Table I). While untreated rhodopsin began to immediately decay at 50 °C, EDTA-treated rhodopsin did not decay for the first 45 min. The protein then began to degrade at a rate constant of 0.025 ± 0.006 min-1, similar to untreated rhodopsin (Fig. 3B and Table I). As EDTA chelates other divalent cations we also examined the use of pH. The solvent-exposed Zn2+ coordination sites, Zn2+1 and Zn2+4, each has a histidine residue as a critical coordinating ligand (Zn2+2 does not). Since protonated histidine has a much lower affinity for Zn2+, we altered solvent pH levels near the pKa of histidine (pH 6.5) to determine whether coordination of Zn2+ occurred at one of these two sites. When we purified rhodopsin at pH 5.5 and 6.0 (equilibrium shifted toward protonated histidine), rhodopsin exhibited no detectable decay in the dark state for a period of at least 120 min (Fig. 3C and Table I). Purification of rhodopsin at pH 7.4, 8.0, and 9.0 (equilibrium shifted toward unprotonated histidine) destabilized rhodopsin in a pH-dependent manner, increasing the decay rates to 0.024 ± 0.001 min-1 (p < 0.001), 0.040 ± 0.001 min-1 (p < 0.001), and 0.049 ± 0.002 min-1 (p < 0.001), respectively (Fig. 3C and Table I). In Fig. 3D, a plot of thermal decay t½versus solvent pH displays a half-point at pH 6.7 ± 0.3, similar to the pKa of the histidine side chain (pH 6.5). These data suggest that rhodopsin thermal stability is directly dependent on the state of histidine protonation. These data further support our hypothesis that coordination of Zn2+ at the solvent-exposed Zn2+1 or Zn2+4 coordination site destabilizes the rhodopsin dark state. Furthermore, it also indicated that coordination of Zn2+ at the Zn2+2 coordination site was most likely not physiologically relevant. This ascertainment is supported by the fact that Zn2+2 has no histidine or cysteine residues, two amino acids commonly"

Exon 2 inclusion is only observed at high levels in smooth muscle (SM) tissues, whereas striated muscle and non-muscle cells use predominantly exon 3. Experiments in cell culture have shown that exon 2 selection results from repression of exon 3 and that this repression is mediated by regulatory elements flanking exon 3. We have now tested the cell culture-derived model in transgenic mice. We show that by harnessing the intronic splicing regulatory elements, expression of an enhanced green fluorescent protein transgene with a constitutively active promoter can be restricted to SM cells. Splicing of both endogenous αTM and a series of transgenes carrying regulatory element mutations was analyzed by reverse transcriptasePCR. These studies indicated that although SM-rich tissues are equipped to regulate splicing of high levels of endogenous or transgene αTM RNA, other non-SM tissues such as spleen, which express lower amounts of αTM, also splice significant proportions of exon 2, and this splicing pattern can be recapitulated by transgenes expressed at low levels. We confirm the importance in vivo of the negatively acting regulatory elements for regulated skipping of exon 3. Moreover, we provide evidence that some of the regulatory factors responsible for exon 3 skipping appear to be titratable, with loss of regulated splicing sometimes being associated with high transgene expression levels.

Alternative splicing is a major form of gene regulation in multicellular eukaryotes. It allows the repertoire of expressed proteins to far exceed the number of available genes by the generation from single genes of multiple mRNAs encoding functionally distinct proteins (1Black D.L. Cell. 2000; 103: 367-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 2Maniatis T. Tasic B. Nature. 2002; 418: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar, 3Roberts G.C.

Lee C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar) and, more recently, splice-sensitive microarrays (5Johnson J.M. Castle J. Garrett-Engele P. Kan Z. Loerch P.M.

Science. 2003; 302: 2141-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) have indicated that most human genes are alternatively spliced. In addition to allowing generation of qualitatively distinct proteins, a large number of human alternative splicing events lead to quantitative regulation of gene expression by generating RNAs that are substrates for degradation by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) 1The abbreviations used are: NMD, nonsense-mediated decay; αTM, α-tropomyosin; SM, smooth muscle; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; RT, reverse transcriptase; Q-RT-PCR, quantitative real time PCR; URE, upstream regulatory element; DRE, downstream regulatory element; GFP, green fluorescent protein; VSMCs, vascular smooth muscle cells; PTB, polypyrimidine tract-binding protein; nt, nucleotide.

Alternative splicing is therefore of interest as a basic mechanism that allows regulated gene expression. It is likewise of interest as a technical tool that could be used to provide regulated restriction of transgene expression, perhaps in combination with regulated promoters. Most studies of regulated mammalian alternative splicing have used tissue culture lines to analyze splicing of transfected minigene constructs, in combination with in vitro analysis in cell extracts (7Black D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 291-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (1997) Google Scholar). Although this approach has allowed much progress to be made in the characterization of regulatory RNA sequences and the trans-acting factors with which they interact, it is an approach with some limitations. For example, many alternative splicing events are regulated in tissue types for which there are no reliable cultured cell lines. Smooth muscle is a good example of such a tissue. Smooth muscle cells are important in various locations in the body, and smooth muscle dysfunction underlies a number of pathologies (8Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Vascular smooth muscle is responsible for controlling blood flow and systemic blood pressure. Alterations in the state of differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from a contractile to a proliferative phenotype are associated with the development of atherosclerotic plaques and restenosis (9Shanahan C.M. Weissberg P.L. Metcalfe J.C. Circ. Res. 1993; 73: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The transition between the normal contractile phenotype and the proliferative VSMC phenotype is accompanied by various alterations in gene expression at the transcriptional and splicing levels (8Owens G.K. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 487-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar). Despite the biomedical importance of SMCs, there are no cultured SMC lines that reliably maintain the differentiated phenotype. We have previously used the α-tropomyosin (TM) gene as a model system for regulated splicing (10Mullen M.P. Smith C.W. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B.

Cell. 1989; 56: 749-758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Exons 2 and 3 are spliced in a mutually exclusive manner, with predominant inclusion of exon 2 only in smooth muscle tissues, whereas exon 3 is used almost exclusively in striated muscles (cardiac and skeletal) and most other tissues where αTM expression could be observed (18Wieczorek D.F. Smith C.W.J. Nadal Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Lees Miller J.P. Goodwin L.O. Helfman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1729-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including proliferating VSMCs (20Gooding C. Kemp P. Smith C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15201-15207Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Likewise, transfection of minigene constructs into almost all cell types resulted in predominant or exclusive inclusion of exon 3 (10Mullen M.P. Smith C.W. Patton J.G. Nadal-Ginard B. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 642-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The exception was in PAC-1 cells, a VSMC line derived from embryonic rat pulmonary artery (11Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 21Rothman A. Kulik T.J. Taubman M.B. Berk B.C. Smith C.W.J. Nadal Ginard B. Circulation. 1992; 86: 1977-1986Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The combination of restriction of exon 2 selection to smooth muscle tissues and PAC-1 cells for transfected constructs led to the concept that exon 3 represents the “default” splicing pathway, with exon 2 selection resulting only from specific regulation in SM cells. PAC-1 cells typically show ∼20 –50% inclusion of exon 2 in both their endogenous αTM gene and in transiently expressed minigenes, and have therefore facilitated characterization of the regulatory mechanisms responsible for switching selection between αTM exons 2 and 3 (11Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 12Gooding C.G. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6301-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The regulatory switch involves inhibition of exon 3 and does not require the presence of exon 2. Regulation is mediated by four sequence elements (11Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The polypyrimidine tract of exon 3 (P3), one of the essential 3′ splice site elements, contains three optimal binding sites for polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), a splicing repressor (22Perez I. Lin C.-H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Midway between the P3 pyrimidine tract and exon 3, which are separated by an unusually long distance (100 nt), there is an upstream regulatory element (URE) consisting of a short cluster of UGC (or CUG) repeats (11Gooding C. Roberts G.C. Moreau G. Nadal Ginard B. Smith C.W.J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3861-3872Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 13Gromak N. Smith C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3548-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Downstream of the exon there is an essential downstream regulatory element (DRE). The DRE is composed of both a short stretch of UGC/CUG motifs, known as DUGC and a pyrimidine tract (DY). Whereas both the P3 and DY pyrimidine tracts are known to bind the repressor protein PTB (12Gooding C.G. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 16Wollerton M.C. Gooding C. Robinson F. Brown E.C. Jackson R.J. Smith C.W. RNA (N. Y.). 2001; 7: 819-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 22Perez I. Lin C.-H. McAfee J.G. Patton J.G. RNA (N. Y.). 1997; 3: 764-778PubMed Google Scholar), the factors that bind to the URE and DUGC elements are, as yet, uncharacterized. These regulatory elements are capable of conferring PAC-1 cell-regulated splicing to heterologous exons (15Roberts G.C. Gooding C. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6301-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that they may be sufficient to restrict gene expression in transgenic animals. Whereas PAC-1 cells have proven very useful in characterizing these regulatory elements, their partial and variable state of differentiation calls into question the extent to which these findings can be generalized, especially in other smooth muscle tissues in vivo. We therefore decided to analyze control of αTM alternative splicing in transgenic mice, using reporter constructs based on enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), in which EGFP expression was dependent upon the regulated exclusion of the αTM exon. Our data confirm the importance of the previously characterized regulatory elements, but also challenge the simple concept of a regulated “smooth muscle” splicing pattern and a default splicing pattern elsewhere. Finally, our data demonstrate that the intronic elements flanking αTM exon 3 can be harnessed to drive highly tissue-restricted gene expression in transgenic animals, and so could be a useful technical tool, especially in conjunction with tissue-restricted promoters with overlapping specificity. Plasmids and Cloning—The vector pCAGGS was a generous gift of Jun-ichi Miazaki (University of Osaka). To ensure appropriate initiation of translation, the Kozak sequence in the EGFP gene of pCAGGS was converted to a consensus sequence (GCCACCATGG) by PCR. The introns were inserted between bases 5 and 6 of the EGFP open reading frame in a two-step process. First, a short sequence containing a consensus 5′ splice site and 3′ splice site separated by unique AflII and SmaI sites was inserted. pGTM2 and pGTM3 were generated by amplification of the α-TM exon 2 or 3 containing cassettes from pNeoTM2 and pNeoTM3, respectively (15Roberts G.C. Gooding C. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6301-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the case of GTM2, the XhoI site at the 5′ end of exon 2 was infilled, resulting in a 4-nt frameshifting insertion. In GTM3aG to A mutation at nt 106 of exon 3 introduced a TGA stop codon in the EGFP open reading frame. The P3Δ123, ΔURE, ΔDRE, and 3URE mutations were cassette-cloned into the pGTM3 background from the mutant TM constructs reported previously (12Gooding C.G. Roberts G.C. Smith C.W.J. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 85-100PubMed Google Scholar, 13Gromak N. Smith C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3548-3557Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 14Gromak N. Rideau A. Southby J. Scadden A.D. Gooding C. Huttelmaier S. Singer R.H. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6356-6364Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Generation of Transgenic Mice—Transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection of SalI-linearized plasmid DNA into CBA × C57Bl/6 fertilized eggs. Viable offspring were genotyped by PCR of tail samples for the presence of the EGFP transgene. Isolation of Tissues and RNA—Tissues were harvested from 8- to 10-week-old transgenic mice killed by CO2 asphyxiation. To ensure consistent parts of each tissue were used, the same dissection and tissue preparation protocol was used for all animals. All tissues were placed into RNA-Later solution immediately after dissection except for the heart and aorta which were removed as a single unit and placed into phosphate-buffered saline. Excess fatty tissue around the junction of the heart and aorta was removed before the aorta was cut away from the heart. The aorta was stripped of fat before immersion in RNA-Later solution. The atria were removed, and the ventricles were placed into RNA-Later. All tissue was stored at –20 °C prior to processing. RNA was isolated using the RN-Easy kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The RNA was quantified by fluorescence using the ribogreen kit (Molecular Probes). RT-PCR—250 ng of RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After heating to 70 °C to inactivate the enzyme, the reactions were diluted to 100 μl. For PCR detection of GTM2 splicing (Fig. 2B), 0.5 μl of diluted RT reaction was used in 25-μl PCRs with a 1 mm MgCl2-containing buffer. An 80 °C hot start was followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s using the primers 5′ CGTM (5′ GGCAAAGAATTCGCCACCA 3′) and 3′ CGTM (5′ GGGTGTCGCCCTCGAACTT 3′). Exon inclusion gave a band of 506 bp, and exon skipping gave a band of 376 bp. For endogenous α-tropomyosin splicing (Fig. 2A), the PCRs used 3 μl of RT template in 25-μl reactions. An 80 °C hot start was followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 63 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s using the primers mTM1 (5′ AGAACGCCTTGGATCGA 3′) and mTM4 (5′ AACAGACGCATCCAGCT 3′). PCR products were then phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and then digested with XhoI, which cuts specifically in exon 2. Exon 3 products were 204 bp, whereas exon 2 products were 150 and 54 bp. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Q-RT-PCR was carried out using SYBR green detection for the endogenous α-tropomyosin transcripts and Taqman detection for the spliced EGFP transcripts. For the endogenous α-tropomyosin transcripts, 5 μl of RT product was added to a mixture containing 12.5 μl of SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 2.5 μl of primer E (10 pmol/μl) or F (10 pmol/μl), and 2.5 μl of primer G (10 pmol/μl) in a final volume of 25 μl. Primer E detected transcripts including α-TM exon 3 and had the sequence CAAATACTCCGAGGCTCTCAAAG. Primer F detected transcripts α-TM exon 2 and had the sequence GCTGGAGGAGCTGCACAAG. Primer G had the sequence GCGATCCAACTCCTCCTCAA. Samples were incubated at 50 °C for 2 min and heated to 95 °C for 10 min. PCR was performed using 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min in an ABI 7000. Ribosomal RNA was quantified in parallel reactions using 12.5 μl of Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.125 μl of rRNA forward primer, 0.125 μl of rRNA reverse primer, 0.125 μl of VIC-labeled rRNA Taqman probe, and 5 μl of cDNA in a total volume of 25 μl. Each PCR was shown to produce a single correct PCR product with no primer dimer formation. To test the ability of each PCR to detect the correct transcript in the presence of the alternative form of α-tropomyosin cDNA, mixtures of cDNAs consisting of α-TM exons 1-2-4 and α-TM exons 1-3-4 were prepared from known concentrations of each cDNA. The total concentration of DNA in these mixtures ranged from 100 to 0.1 fg, and the percentage of α-TM exons 1-2-4 cDNA was 100, 75, 50, 25, and 0% with the remainder being α-TM exons 1-3-4 cDNA. This analysis showed that neither the PCR for αTM2 nor the PCR for αTM3 detected the other cDNA. Quantitation of these data showed that the amplifications produced linear standard curves for each of the cDNAs. For the EGFP transcripts 5 μl of RT product was added to a mixture containing 12.5 μl of Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.125 μl of rRNA forward primer, 0.125 μl of rRNA reverse primer, 0.125 μl of VIC-labeled rRNA Taqman probe, 2.5 μl of primer A (10 pmol/μl) or B (10pmol/μl), 2.5 μl of primer C (10 pmol/μl), and 1 μl of probe D in a final volume of 25 μl. The rRNA primers are pre-designed Taqman primers (Applied Biosystems). Primer A detected transcripts including the transgene TM exon 3 and had the sequence ACGGAGAAAAAGGCCACAGAT. Primer B detected transcripts excluding the transgene TM exon 3 and had the sequence CGCCACCATGGTGAGCA. Primer C had the sequence GCTGAACTTGTGGCCGTTTAC, and the FAM-labeled probe had the sequence TGGTGCCCATCCTGGTCGAGCT. Samples were incubated at 50 °C for 2 min and heated to 95 °C for 10 min. PCR was performed using 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min in an ABI 7000. To validate this PCR, plasmids containing the EGFP gene spliced to include or skip the central exon were prepared, diluted to known concentrations (10 ng/μl to 160 fg/μl), and mixed. Q-RT-PCR of the mixtures showed that the PCRs produced linear standard curves over this range. Because of the similarity in the sequences and the requirement to use identical upstream primers, both PCRs detect the other form of the transcript. However, in both cases the sensitivity of detection of the alternative form was ∼1000-fold than for the intended target. As a result, the presence of either form below 0.1% of the total product could not be determined. Quantitation of Real Time PCR Data—Data from real time PCR experiments were analyzed by determining the cycle threshold (Ct). Ct corresponds to the cycle number at which the fluorescence reaches a threshold above the base-line value. Each reaction was performed in triplicate, and the Ct value for each test reaction was normalized to the rRNA value for the same sample (for determination using FAM-labeled probes) or to the rRNA value from parallel experiments (when SYBR green detection was used). Fluorescence Microscopy—Tissues from mice were removed and embedded in Cryo-M-Bed. Ten-micron sections were cut, thaw-mounted onto superfrost plus slides, and mounted in glycerol. Sections were analyzed on a Nikon Eclipse E600 microscope. For confocal microscopy the sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. The nuclei were stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Images were captured using a Leica single photon confocal microscope with Leica TLS NT software. Regulation of Transgene Expression by Alternative Splicing—The intronic region upstream of αTM exon 3, including the branch point sequence, P3 pyrimidine tract, and URE, together with the downstream intron including the DRE are sufficient to cause enhanced skipping of αTM exon 3 or a heterologous exon in PAC-1 cells (15Roberts G.C. Gooding C. Smith C.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6301-6310Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We decided to determine whether the characterized intronic elements are able to confer appropriate tissue-specific regulation upon splicing of a heterologous exon in transgenic mice. Our reporter constructs were all based upon EGFP under the control of the ubiquitously expressed CAGGS promoter (23Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). In a control construct the EGFP was present as a single exon (pCAGE), whereas in the other constructs the EGFP was present as a mini-gene consisting of three exons (Fig. 1C). The first exon contained the translational initiator ATG, whereas the third exon contained the remainder of the EGFP open reading frame. The central exon was flanked by the intron regulatory elements that usually surround αTM exon 3. Inclusion of this exon would disrupt the EGFP open reading frame, whereas regulated exon skipping would lead to an mRNA with an intact open reading frame for EGFP. Most of our constructs used TM exon 3 as the central exon, but as an initial test we used αTM exon 2 (construct GTM2, Fig. 1C). This presents a particularly stringent test, because αTM exon 2 contains exon splicing enhancer elements stronger than those in exon 3 (24Dye B.T. Buvoli M. Mayer S.A. Lin C.H. Patton J.G. RNA (N. Y.). 1998; 4: 1523-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and is usually selected in smooth muscle as a consequence of regulated repression of exon 3. Although the exon 2 exon splicing enhancers do not show cell-specific activity in cultured cells, it remains possible that they could mediate SM-specific activity in vivo, which would antagonize the negative regulation imposed by the intronic elements. In order to disrupt the EGFP open reading frame upon exon inclusion, a 4-bp insert in αTM exon 2 was created by infill of an XhoI site. This resulted in a frameshift such that the downstream GFP exon was out of frame. The two initial constructs (pCAGE and pGTM2) were used to generate lines of transgenic mice by pronuclear injection. Consistent with previous reports pCAGE, transgenic mice expressed EGFP in all the tissues examined (23Okabe M. Ikawa M. Kominami K. Nakanishi T. Nishimune Y. FEBS Lett. 1997; 407: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (2265) Google Scholar). These mice could be genotyped by examination under fluorescent light, and all tissues showed strong green fluorescence (data not shown). Conversely, pGTM2 transgenic mice showed no green fluorescence in the skin. Furthermore, no fluorescence was detected in the majority of tissues either as whole organs or in tissue sections. However, EGFP fluorescence was detected in the smooth muscle cells of the gut, bladder, uterus, and vasculature but not within other cell types in these tissues (Fig. 2A). This pattern of fluorescence was observed in three independent transgenic lines. These observations are consistent with restriction of EGFP protein expression to smooth muscle cells by regulated alternative splicing, despite the widespread transcriptional activity of the CAGGS promoter. In order to verify that the GTM2 transgene was transcribed widely and that restricted EGFP expression was because of regulated splicing, RT-PCR was carried out using RNA harvested from various tissues (Fig. 2B). RNA from the transgene could be detected in all the tissue samples, although the levels of expression appeared to be low in the aorta and liver samples. In smooth muscle tissues (e.g. aorta, bladder, gut, and uterus) products corresponding to both inclusion and skipping of the transgene central exon were observed (Fig. 2B). In the kidney and heart no exon skipping was observed, whereas the lung sample showed predominant inclusion of the exon, with a small proportion of skipping. Surprisingly, in the liver both forms of the mRNA were detected even though EGFP was not detectable, presumably due to the low levels of expression. An additional strong band was observed in the kidney, heart, and lung samples about 100 bp above the exon included band. Sequencing of this product showed that it contained an additional 107-nt insert between the TM exon and the downstream GFP exon. This insert corresponds to a pseudo-exon, flanked by a consensus 5′ splice site and a nonconsensus GAG 3′ splice site just downstream of the DRE. The pseudo-exon has been shown to be activated by a number of simple mutations in transfected constructs. 2N. Grellscheid and C. W. J. Smith, unpublished observations. To compare splicing of the endogenous gene with the transgene, the samples were analyzed by PCR for αTM using primers in exon 1 and exon 4. The amplicons generated from both αTM mRNA isoforms containing exons 2 or 3 are identical in size but can be distinguished by digestion with XhoI, which cleaves within exon 2 but not 3. This analysis showed that the exon 2-containing isoform was detectable in all the smooth muscle tissues and the liver but was not detected in the heart, kidney, or lung indicating that the transgene-splicing pattern mimicked the splicing pattern of the endogenous gene (Fig. 2C). The only exception was that there was no evidence of the pseudo-exon containing band with the endogenous gene. These initial data from the GTM2 transgenic mice clearly indicated that the regulatory elements flanking αTM exon 3 are sufficient to confer tissue-specific repression of splicing upon a heterologous exon and that this can be harnessed to allow regulated gene expression. We therefore decided to analyze in more detail the regulation of αTM splicing in vivo and the role of the regulatory elements previously defined in transient PAC-1 cell transfections. Quantitative Analysis of Endogenous αTM Splicing—Our initial RT-PCR analysis had indicated an unexpected degree of exon 2 selection in liver (Fig. 2C), which is not enriched in smooth muscle cells, calling into question the cell type specificity of αTM splicing. Before further analyzing splicing of the EGFP transgenes, we therefore decided to quantitatively analyze splicing of exons 2 and 3 of αTM across a range of tissues. This had previously been surveyed qualitatively by nuclease protection and was restricted primarily to those tissues with high levels of expression (18Wieczorek D.F. Smith C.W.J. Nadal Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 679-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Lees Miller J.P. Goodwin L.O. Helfman D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1729-1742Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of αTM mRNAs containing either exon 2 or exon 3 were determined by quantitative real time PCR and compared with the levels of rRNA in the same mouse tissue RNA samples. The proportion of αTM mRNA containing exon 2 (the “regulated” or SM pathway) was plotted against αTM mRNA expression level relative to rRNA (Fig. 3). Tissues with the highest levels of expression (heart, skeletal muscle, bladder, and aorta) showed the most extreme variations in splicing pattern. The striated muscle tissues, heart and skeletal muscle, which had the highest level of αTM expression, showed less than 0.2% exon 2 selection. In contrast, aorta and bladder, with the next highest levels of αTM expression, had more than 95% exon 2 selection. The next highest amount of αTM mRNA was present in the small intestine and lung, two tissues with a significant smooth muscle content. The amount of the exon 2-containing αTM in these samples was 80% for the small intestine and 29% in the lung. The brain had the lowest level of exon 2 inclusion (7%) apart from heart and skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, the other three tissues, none of"

Here, we performed in situ structural probing, as well as in vitro structural and functional studies, of the initiation complexes formed by highly divergent isolates (MAL and NL4.3/HXB2). Our results show that the structure of the initiation complex is not conserved. In MAL, and according to sequence analysis in 14% of HIV-1 isolates, formation of the initiation complex is accompanied by complex rearrangements of the viral RNA, and extensive interactions withtRNA3Lys are required for efficient initiation of reverse transcription. In NL4.3, HXB2, and most isolates,tRNA3Lys annealing minimally affects the viral RNA structure and no interaction outside the PBS is required for optimal initiation of reverse transcription. We suggest that in MAL, extensive interactions withtRNA3Lys are required to drive the structural rearrangements generating the structural elements ultimately recognized by reverse transcriptase. In NL4.3 and HXB2, these elements are already present in the viral RNA prior totRNA3Lys annealing, thus explaining that extensive interactions with the primer are not required. Interestingly, such interactions are required in HXB2 mutants designed to use a non-cognate tRNA as primer (tRNAHis).

Reverse transcriptase (RT), 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; PBS, primer binding site; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; DMS, dimethyl sulfate; WT, wild type; CRF, circulating recombinant forms. an RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase that also harbors an RNase H domain, converts the single-stranded genomic RNA of retroviruses into a double-stranded DNA with duplicated long terminal repeats (1Gilboa E. Mitra S.W. Goff S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). It initiates DNA synthesis from a tRNA,tRNA3Lys in the case of the type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1), that is selectively encapsidated into the viral particles (2Marquet R. Isel C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 14349-14355Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). During budding and maturation of the retroviral particles, the 18 3′-terminal nucleotides of the primer tRNA are annealed to the primer binding site (PBS) located in the 5′-region of the genomic RNA. Additional interactions between the genomic RNA and the primer tRNA have been described in several retroviruses, including avian retroviruses (4Aiyar A. Cobrinik D. Ge Z. Kung H.J. Leis J. J.

Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 731-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In HIV-1, several alternative interactions between the viral RNA (vRNA) andtRNA3Lys have been proposed, but no consensus model has been reached. The most detailed in vitro structural studies of the initiation complex of reverse transcription were performed on the HIV-1 MAL isolate (9Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 10Isel C. Marquet R. Keith G. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) structure models of the MAL initiation complex. In these models, parts of the anticodon arm and of the variable loop oftRNA3Lys interact with the vRNA, upstream of the PBS (Fig. 1). Of particular importance is the interaction between the anticodon loop oftRNA3Lys and a viral A-rich loop (helix 6C in Fig. 1b) that is crucial for efficient initiation of HIV-1 MAL reverse transcription in vitro (12Isel C. Lanchy J.M. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 917-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 13Goldschmidt V. Rigourd M. Ehresmann C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43233-43242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, no ex vivo data on the MAL reverse transcription is available. MAL is a complex recombinant of HIV-1 subtypes A, D, and I that contains a 23-nucleotide duplication, including part of the PBS and the downstream region (14Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1a). Thus, the general validity of the MAL-based models can be questioned. No detailed structural study of the initiation complex of prototype subtype B isolates, such as HXB2 and the closely related NL4.3, has been performed so far, and functional studies yielded controversial results. Some in vitro experiments suggested that the interaction between the viral A-rich loop andtRNA3Lys anticodon loop also exists in HXB2 (15Arts E.J. Ghosh M. Jacques P.S. Ehresmann B. Le Grice S.F.J.

J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 14185-14195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (analogous to helices 5D and 3E in Fig. 1b). Long term replication experiments with mutant HXB2 viruses designed to use a variety of non-cognate primer tRNAs indicated a functional role for the interaction between the anticodon and A-rich loops. Indeed, whereas mutant HXB2 viruses in which only the PBS was adapted were unstable and rapidly reverted, mutant HXB2 viruses in which the PBS and the viral A-rich loop were simultaneously adapted either to tRNAHis (18Wakefield J.K.

Virol. 2003; 77: 8756-8764Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) could stably use these tRNA species as primer. Finally, in vitro and ex vivo analysis of HXB2 mutated in helix 1 (Fig. 1c) suggested another intermolecular interaction (between the 5′-strand of helix 1 and the TΨC arm oftRNA3Lys), which has been named the PAS (primer activating signal)-anti-PAS interaction (24Beerens N. Groot F. Berkhout B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31247-31256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 25Beerens N. Berkhout B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2329-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Several factors complicate the study of the initiation of reverse transcription and may explain these discrepancies. First, several functional sites overlap in the PBS domain, and mutations may affect several steps in the HIV-1 life cycle (26Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 27Vicenzi E. Dimitrov D.S. Engelman A. Migone T.S. Purcell D.F. Leonard J. Englund G. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7879-7890Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, the HIV-1 RNA structure is versatile (14Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 28Huthoff H. Berkhout B. RNA. 2001; 7: 143-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and mutations may induce aberrant structures, both in vitro and ex vivo, that obscure analysis (29Goldschmidt V. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 850-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Third, in vitro systems used to analyze the initiation of reverse transcription might not adequately reflect the in vivo situation. Finally, the possibility remains that the structure of the initiation complex might not be conserved among HIV-1 isolates. In order to circumvent these problems and to compare the in situ structure of the MAL and NL4.3 initiation complexes of reverse transcription, we performed the first structural probing of the HIV-1 genomic RNA in infected cells (i.e. prior totRNA3Lys annealing) and in viral particles (i.e. aftertRNA3Lys annealing and virus maturation). These structural data were consistent with the in vitro probing data we collected on the MAL, NL4.3, and HXB2 complexes, and validated the in vitro functional studies we performed on the wild-type (WT) MAL and HXB2 isolates and on HXB2 mutants utilizing tRNAHis as primer. Taken together, our results show that in HXB2/NL4.3 and, according to extensive sequence analysis, in 86% of HIV-1 isolates, there is no stable interaction between the anticodon loop oftRNA3Lys and the A-rich loop. This loop-loop interaction clusters to the A and G HIV-1 subgroups and recombinants of the former subgroup, including MAL. In HIV-1 MAL, this interaction counteracts a negative contribution of the vRNA. This interaction also exists in the mutant HIV-1 HXB 2 viruses using tRNAHis as primer, where it neutralizes a negative contribution of the tRNAHis primer. This last result explains why these mutant HXB2 viruses do not behave as the WT HXB2 isolate. Primers, Templates, and RT Used for in Vitro Studies—NativetRNA3Lys was purified from beef liver as described (30Bénas P. Bec G. Keith G. Marquet R. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Dumas P. RNA. 2000; 6: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Its sequence and post-transcriptional modifications are identical to those of humantRNA3Lys. Synthesis and purification of tRNAHis were previously described (31Rigourd M. Goldschmidt V. Brule F. Morrow C.D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5764-5775Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar).ORN3Lys and ORNHis were obtained from Dharmacon Research Inc. Primers were 32P-labeled at their 5′-end according to published procedures (11Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). WT MAL, WT HXB2, HXB2 His, and HXB2 His-AC-GAC RNAs were transcribed in vitro and purified as described (31Rigourd M. Goldschmidt V. Brule F. Morrow C.D. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. Marquet R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5764-5775Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The MAL and HXB2-derived RNAs correspond to nucleotides 1–311 and 1–295 of the genomic RNA, respectively. A plasmid expressing HXB2 HIV-1 RT was kindly provided to us by Dr. Torsten Unge (Uppsala, Sweden), together with the protocols for protein overexpression and purification. Annealing of the Primers to the Templates—Viral RNA andtRNA3Lys, tRNAHis,ORN3Lys, or ORNHis were denatured in water for 2 min at 90 °C and chilled on ice. Annealing was performed at 70 °C for 20 min in sodium cacodylate (pH 7.5) 50 mm, KCl 300 mm. Annealing efficiency was routinely checked by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and was found to be higher than 95% in all experiments. Minus Strand Strong Stop DNA Synthesis—In a standard experiment, vRNA was annealed with 32P-labeled primer (10 nm final concentration) and preincubated for 4 min at 37 °C with 25 nm RT in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 6 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTE. Reverse transcription was initiated by adding dNTP (50 μm each). At times ranging from 15 s to 60 min, DNA synthesis was stopped by an equal volume of formamide containing 50 mm EDTA, and the products were analyzed on 8 or 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and quantified with a Bio-Imager BAS 2000 (Fuji). Data Analysis—Curve fitting was performed with version 4.08 carbon of the Igor Pro Software (WaveMetrics Inc.). Global curve fitting was performed as described in the software manual. In this procedure, data sets obtained with different primers were simultaneously fit with a bi-exponential function. The amplitude parameters were considered as “local” parameters that could adopt different values for each primer, whereas the fast and slow rate constants were considered as “global” parameters with identical values for the two primers. The global fitting approach was validated by the limited increase of the κ2 value divided by the number of data points, as compared with “simple” fitting, despite the fact the number of adjustable parameters was reduced. In all cases, this value was <6 × 10-4. Chemical Probing of vRNA in Vitro—After hybridization, the vRNA/tRNA complexes were incubated at 20 °C for 15 min in the annealing buffer supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2 before probing with dimethyl sulfate (DMS). After addition of 1 μg of yeast total tRNA, RNA was modified by addition of 1 μl of 10-fold diluted DMS for 5 or 10 min. RNA modification was stopped with 200 μl of ethanol and 50 μl of sodium acetate (0.3 m, pH 5.3) containing 1 μg of glycogen. Modified bases were detected by primer extension with reverse transcriptase as previously described (14Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Infectious Molecular Clones—The HIV-1 NL4.3 molecular clone was used to generate a chimerical construct, pNL4.3-MAL, containing nucleotides 61–274 from the MAL isolate substituted for the homologous NL4.3 region. To obtain this construct, the AflII-BssHII fragment of pJCB (32Paillart J.C. Marquet R. Skripkin E. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27486-27493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was PCR-amplified using primers pS-1/15MAL (5′-GTC TCT CTT GTT AGA CCA G-3′) and pAS-BssHII (5′-CCG CCC CTC GCC TCT TGC CGT GCG CGC TTC AGC AAG CCG AGT CC-3′). The underlined nucleotides correspond to changes introduced to restore a subtype B dimerization initiation site (33Brunel C. Marquet R. Romby P. Ehresmann C. Biochimie (Paris). 2002; 84: 925-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and allow subsequent cloning into the pNL4.3 molecular clone. The PCR product was digested with AflII and BssHII and cloned between the same restriction sites of pLTR5′ (34Paillart J.-C. Berthoux L. Ottmann M. Darlix J.-L. Marquet R. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8348-8354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), generating pLTR5′-MAL. Finally, the AatII-SphI fragment of pLTR5′-MAL was substituted for the homologous region of pNL4.3. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Infection—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium. CEMx174 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium. All cells were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum. HeLa cells were transfected with 10 μg of WT and mutant plasmids using the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method. Progeny viruses were quantified by a micro RT assay of the cell culture supernatants (35Moog C. Wick A. Le Ber P. Kirn A. Aubertin A.M. Antiviral Res. 1994; 24: 275-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Five million CEMx174 cells were infected with equivalent amounts of virus as determined by RT activity. One hour after infection, the cells were diluted in 20 ml of RPMI 1640. In Vivo RNA Modification—At 72 h after infection, CEMx174 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in 30 μl of this buffer. Progeny viruses were clarified by centrifugation and passed through a 0.22-μm cellulose acetate filter (Millipore). The culture supernatant was then pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion by ultracentrifugation with a SW28 rotor at 27,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C. Virus pellets were suspended in 90 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells and viruses were treated with 3 μl of DMS for 4 and 8 min at 37 °C. Reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of TriReagent (Molecular Research Center), and RNA was extracted as described by the supplier. Modified bases were detected by primer extension as described (14Baudin F. Marquet R. Isel C. Darlix J.L. Ehresmann B. Ehresmann C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 382-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Sequence Alignment—An alignment of the 538 HIV-1 sequences encompassing nucleotides 550–700 was recovered from the HIV sequence data base (www.hiv.lanl.gov) (36Kuiken C.L. Foley B. Hahn B. Korber B. McCutchan F. Marx P.A. Mellors J.W. Mullins J.I. Sodroski J. Wolinksy S. Human Retroviruses and AIDS 2000: A Compilation and Analysis of Nucleic Acid and Amino Acid Sequences. Theoretical Biology and Biophysics Group, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Los Alamos, NM2000Google Scholar). (Numbering is according to the U3 start of HXB2; it corresponds to nucleotides 95–245 of the HXB2 genomic RNA). This alignment was checked with ClustalX (37Chenna R. Sugawara H. Koike T. Lopez R. Gibson T.J. Higgins D.G. Thompson J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3497-3500Crossref PubMed Scopus (4081) Google Scholar) and improved manually in a text editor. In order to gain further insight into the initiation complex of HIV-1 reverse transcription and to conciliate divergent results, we studied the structure of this complex ex vivo, thus preventing any potential artifact due to in vitro primer annealing and RNA renaturation, and to the absence of viral and/or cellular cofactors. In addition, we compared the initiation complexes formed by the MAL and NL4.3/HXB2 isolates. These isolates significantly differ in their sequence and RNA secondary structure of the PBS domain beforetRNA3Lys annealing (Fig. 1, a and c). In Situ and in Vitro Structural Probing of NL4.3 and HXB2 Initiation Complexes—DMS, which modifies adenines at position N1 and cytosines at N3 when the Watson-Crick side of these nucleotides is not base-paired (38Brunel C. Romby P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 318: 3-21Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), has been extensively used to probe the structure of retroviral initiation complexes in vitro (8Fossé P. Mougel M. Keith G.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In order to extend these results to more biologically relevant contexts, we probed the structure of the vRNA directly in infected cells (i.e. prior totRNA3Lys annealing) and in viral particles (i.e. aftertRNA3Lys annealing and virus maturation). Infected cells and purified virions were treated with DMS, and the RNA was extracted after chemical modification. Modified nucleotides in the genomic RNA were specifically detected by extension of primers complementary to sequences located 3′ of the major splice donor site, which could not anneal to spliced HIV RNA. The results described below represent the first successful in situ probing of HIV RNA. We first studied CEMx174 cells acutely infected with NL4.3, as well as their progeny virions (Fig. 2a). In the absence of DMS treatment, a strong pause was observed in the PBS of NL4.3 RNA extracted from cells, but not in the RNA extracted from virions. This specific pausing might be due to RNA degradation by cellular RNases during RNA extraction, or to selective exclusion of the degraded RNA from the virions. This pause decreased further extension of the primer, producing a slightly weaker signal in the cells, as compared with virions. The reactivity profile of NL4.3 RNA in cells is fully compatible with the secondary structure model presented in Fig. 1c: most reactive nucleotides are located in bulges (i.e. A-132, A-133, A-159), internal and apical loops (i.e. C-151, C-152, A-157, A-170, A-171, A-172) and in the single-stranded stretch 3′ to the PBS; a few are located in unstable helical regions. When compared with cells, nucleotides A-191, A-192, C-193, A-194, and A-198 are protected in virions, as expected fromtRNA3Lys annealing to the PBS. However, this protection was incomplete, in keeping with previous studies revealing suboptimal PBS occupancy in virions (40Gabor J. Cen S. Javanbakht H. Niu M. Kleiman L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9096-9102Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Beside these changes, the DMS modification pattern of NL4.3 RNA was remarkably similar in cells and in virions, with only minor differences in the band intensities. The most pronounced differences were located at A-216, A-147, and C-151, which were reactive in the cells, and became protected in the virions (Fig. 2a). Remarkably, adenines 168–170 were not protected in virions, indicating that thetRNA3Lys anticodon loop did not interact with the NL4.3 A-rich loop (Fig. 2a). Taken together, our in situ probing experiments on NL4.3 RNA indicated that this RNA underwent little, if any, structural rearrangement during formation of the initiation complex of reverse transcription. In addition, they did not reveal any interaction betweentRNA3Lys and the vRNA outside the PBS. In order to check if the same complex was formed in vitro in the absence of cofactors, we probed NL4.3 and HXB2 RNA before and aftertRNA3Lys annealing (Fig. 2, b and c). For these experiments, the potassium chloride concentration was increased to 300 mm, in order to stabilize and more easily detect weak tertiary interactions (11Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In vitro, a strong pause was observed in the PBS of NL4.3 and HXB2 RNA whentRNA3Lys was annealed at this site (Fig. 2, b and c). Otherwise, in vitro DMS modification patterns were remarkably similar to those obtained in situ (compare Fig. 2a to Fig. 2, b and c). In vitro,tRNA3Lys annealing protected the PBS nucleotides and A-147 in both templates. In addition, the reactivity of C-179 increased upon primer annealing to HXB2 RNA. However, formation of the initiation complex did not induce extensive rearrangements of NL4.3 and HXB2 RNA (Fig. 2, b and c). In addition, the A-rich loop of both RNAs (nucleotides 168–170) remained accessible to DMS aftertRNA3Lys annealing, indicating that it did not stably interact with the anticodon loop. The one-nucleotide shift observed around position 215 in the modification patterns of NL4.3 and HXB2 RNA (Fig. 2, b and c) was due to sequence differences between these HIV-1 isolates (Fig. 1c). In Situ and in Vitro Structural Probing of MAL PBS Domain—Next, we performed in situ structural probing of the MAL initiation complex. However, MAL replicates poorly in most cell types (41Alizon M. Wain-Hobson S. Montagnier L. Sonigo P. Cell. 1986; 46: 63-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), and we were unable to obtain enough material for in situ DMS probing by using the MAL molecular clone. Therefore, we substituted nucleotides 61–274 (including the complete PBS domain) of MAL for the homologous region of the NL4.3 molecular clone. The resulting chimerical NL4.3-MAL clone was infectious and replication kinetics of NL4.3 and NL4.3-MAL viruses were similar (data not shown). This clone thus allowed us to probe the MAL PBS domain in cells and in virions. A very strong RT stop was observed in the PBS of NL4.3-MAL RNA extracted from cells, but not from virions. As a result, the intensity of the bands located 5′ of this stop strongly decreased (Fig. 3a). In order to correct this bias, we overexposed this part of the gels to equalize the band intensities (Fig. 3b). In sharp contrast with NL4.3 (Fig. 2a), the DMS modification patterns of NL4.3-MAL RNA were very different in infected cells and in virions (Fig. 3, a and b). Remarkably, these patterns were very similar to those obtained prior and after in vitrotRNA3Lys annealing (Fig. 3c). The nucleotides in the PBS, as well as A-122, A-134, A-138, A-147, C-158, A-165, A-166, A-211, A-212, and C-213 were more reactive in cells and prior to in vitrotRNA3Lys annealing, than in virions and after in vitrotRNA3Lys annealing (Fig. 3). Conversely, the reactivity of nucleotides A-130, A-131, A-150, C-151, A-157, A-206, A-207, and A-218 increased in viral particles and aftertRNA3Lys annealing in vitro (Fig. 3). Hence, our probing data indicated that extensive structural rearrangements took place during formation of the MAL initiation complex of reverse transcription in situ and in vitro. Indeed, as previously shown (9Isel C. Ehresmann C. Keith G. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 236-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) for the in vitro data, the modification patterns of NL4.3-MAL in cells and virions are compatible with the secondary structure models depicted in Fig. 1, a and b, respectively. The only significant difference between in vitro and in situ data concerned protection of adenines 164–167, which resulted from the interaction between the viral A-rich loop and the anticodon loop oftRNA3Lys (Fig. 1b). This protection was less pronounced in situ than in vitro (Fig. 3, b and c). Several factors might explain this difference. First, the higher potassium chloride concentration and the lower temperature used for in vitro probing experiments are expected to stabilize this interaction (11Isel C. Westhof E. Massire C. Le Grice S.F.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Marquet R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1038-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Second, nucleocapsid protein, which covers the initiation complex of reverse transcription in virions, might destabilize this labile interaction (42Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolski M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Quantification indicated that the reacti"

It provides electrons for a broad range of reactions, including fatty acid desaturation, cholesterol biosynthesis, and a variety of cytochrome P450-dependent oxidation and hydroxylation reactions (1, 2). Cytochrome P450 (cyt P450) is responsible for the oxidation of a large number of substrates. The overall stoichiometry of the reaction catalyzed by cyt P450 is shown in Reaction 1, where RH is the substrate (3).RH + O2 + NADPH + H+→ROH + H2O + NADP+REACTION 1 The cyt P450 catalytic reaction occurs via a reaction cycle that involves substrate binding, reduction of the ferric heme, O2 binding, reduction of the oxyferrous heme (second electron transfer), substrate oxidation, and finally product dissociation (4). Both ferric and oxyferrous cyt P450 receive electrons from NADPH via its redox partner, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase (cyt P450 reductase), whereas cyt b5 can donate the second electron. Because of the high redox potential of =20 mV for cyt b5, the first electron required to reduce cyt P450 from the ferric to the ferrous state is always transferred from NADPH via cyt P450 reductase. However, as the redox potential of cyt P450 increases from = -230 mV to +50 mV on transition to the oxyferrous state, the second electron can be obtained from either cyt P450 reductase or cyt b5 (5, 6). Depending on the substrate, isozyme of cyt P450 and the experimental conditions cyt b5 can stimulate, inhibit, or have no effect on cyt P450 activity (2). Studies of the stoichiometry of the metabolism of benzphetamine and methoxyflurane by cyt P450 2B4 have shown that cyt b5 increases the efficiency of catalysis by cyt P450 2B4 primarily by decreasing the formation of the side-product superoxide. However, cyt b5 can also inhibit the rate of oxidation catalyzed by cyt P450, by competing with cyt P450 reductase. This effect of cyt b5 is observed as a decrease in the overall rate of NADPH consumption (7). Microsomal cyt b5 is a 15-kDa protein consisting of two domains. The larger, heme-containing domain is hydrophilic and contains the binding site for its redox partners. The membrane-binding domain at the COOH terminus consists of a hydrophobic a-helix that anchors the protein to the lipid bi-layer of the endoplasmic reticulum (8-10). The two domains are connected by a highly flexible peptide chain of = 15 amino acids, which is assumed to allow the heme domain enough flexibility to bind different electron partners while ensuring that the protein remains localized at the endoplasmic reticulum. Solubilization of the cyt b5 heme domain by removal of the membrane anchor through protease cleavage of the linker region generates a protein that is capable of electron transfer to soluble electron acceptor proteins such as cytochrome c, met-myoglobin, or met-hemoglobin, but incapable of electron transfer to microsomal cyt P450 (1). This dramatic change in the properties of cyt b5 upon elimination of its transmembrane domain indicates that it plays an essential role in the function of cyt b5. The role of the linker sequence in facilitating the ability of cyt b5 to reduce cyt P450 2B4 is explored by altering the length and sequence of the flexible linker region between the heme domain and membrane anchor of cyt b5. Deletion of 8-10 residues from the linker region of cyt b5 impaired the ability of cyt b5 to associate with and transfer electrons to cyt P450, whereas addition of 16 alanine residues to, or complete reversal of, the linker region did not affect the ability to form an active complex with cyt P450. These findings demonstrate that, although the sequence of the linker region can be varied without significant effect on the properties of cyt b5, the linker region has a critical minimum length of 6-8 residues. L-3-Dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine was purchased from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories (Toronto, Canada), and me-thoxyflurane was from Abbott Laboratories (Abbott Park, IL). Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase and DpnI were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Restriction enzymes EcoRI, AflIII, and NcoI were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). C41 and C43 cells were from Avidis (Saint Beauzire, France). Benzphetamine was from Sigma. All other chemicals were purchased from Fisher. The strategy for delineating the position and length of the cyt b5 linker region was to identify both the COOH terminus of the heme domain and the NH2 terminus of the membrane binding domain and consider the linker region to be the polypeptide chain connecting the two domains. The full amino acid sequence of rabbit cyt b5 was aligned with 16 other cyt b5 sequences obtained from the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) nucleotide data base using BLAST (11, 12). The multiple-sequence alignment program ClustalW was used to align the heme domains and identify conserved residues (13). The COOH terminus of the heme domain was estimated by examination of the known crystal and NMR structures of the solubilized heme domains of bovine, rat microsomal, and outer mitochondrial membrane cyt b5 and the NMR structure of bovine microsomal cyt b5 (8, 14-18). To determine the NH2 terminus of the membrane binding domain, the program MPEx was used to predict the amino acids of the cyt b5 transmembrane helix (19-21). Using a sliding window of 19 amino acids, MPEx calculates the amount of free energy (ΔGWOCT) required to transfer the selected amino acid sequence from water into octanol. A negative value of ΔGWOCT indicates that the amino acid sequence will be stable in the =30-A hydrocarbon core of the lipid bilayer. After identifying the amino acids that are predicted to form the hydrophobic center of the transmembrane helix, the total length of the transmembrane helix was estimated by calculating the number of residues likely to interact with the interfacial regions of the membrane bilayer. The COOH terminus of the linker region was assumed to be in the ordered waters molecules above the plane of the interfacial region. After the regions corresponding to the heme domain, linker region, and membrane binding domain of the cyt b5 were identified, the sequences for each region were aligned separately with ClustalW to obtain values for the percentage of homology of each sequence to rabbit cyt b5. Unless otherwise specified, all DNA manipulations were performed as described by Ausubel et al. (22). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the previously prepared pLW01-b5mem plasmid that contained the -lactamase gene, which conferred ampicillin resistance, and the cDNA for wild type rabbit cyt b5 downstream of a T7 promoter (9). Mutations were introduced into the pLW01-b5mem plasmid using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The primers that were used to generate the mutant cyts b5 were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) and are summarized in Table I. Polymerase chain reactions were performed in a DNA thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene). DNA was melted for 2 min at 95 °C, followed by 18 cycles of 1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C and 8 min at 68 °C to amplify the DNA. The restriction enzyme DpnI was used to remove the methylated template DNA from the products of the PCR mixture. Because a low mutation efficiency was expected owing to the large number of residues being inserted or deleted, silent restriction sites were introduced into the primers as a means of testing plasmids for primer incorporation. PCR products containing the mutated DNA were replicated in XL blue-supercompetent cells. The plasmid DNA was purified using a Mini-prep plasmid extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and concentrated using vacuum centrifugation. A silent NcoI site was introduced into the primer used to prepare the cDNA of the A92-93 deletion mutant cyt b5. Because the 3.4 kbp pLW01-b5mem plasmid contains a second NcoI site =300 bp downstream of the A92-93 deletion, digestion of the purified plasmids produced two DNA fragments of >200 bp on a 0.8% agarose gel (Invitrogen). A unique EcoRI site was introduced into the primers used to prepare the cDNA for the A103-104, A101-104, A99-104, and A97-104 mutant cyts b5. When the purified plasmids were digested with EcoRI and AflIII, two DNA fragments of >200 bp were observed on a 0.8% agarose gel. In the absence of the EcoRI site, only a single band of linearized plasmid DNA was observed. The cDNA of A97-104 was used to construct the A95-104, A93-104, and A90-104 mutant cyts b5. To check for the incorporation of the mutated primers in the purified plasmids of these three mutants, the EcoRI site was removed from the primer. Thus, when the plasmid was digested with EcoRI and AflIII, only the linearized DNA was observed instead of the two fragments observed with the cDNA of A97-104. To verify the primer had been successfully inserted without ancillary errors, the entire gene was sequenced by the DNA sequencing facility at the University of Michigan. The cDNA for wild type cyt b5 was used to generate the following substitution and deletion mutants: P95A and K94A, Δ92-93, Δ103-104, Δ101-104, Δ99-104, and Δ97-104. The mutated plasmid containing the DNA for Δ97-104 cyt b5 was used as a template to generate the deletion mutants Δ95-104, Δ93-104, and Δ90-104. To determine whether the sequence of the linker region was important for the function of cyt b5, a mutant cyt b5 was constructed that had the amino acid sequence of the cyt b5 linker region Lys91-Asp104 reversed. Because a primer longer than 45 bp results in a decrease in the efficiency of annealing and in a lower rate of successful mutation, insertion of the 45 bp encoding the 15 amino acids of the reversed sequence linker was performed in three steps, where each step resulted in the sequential addition of 4-6 amino acids. The suffix RSL is used to denote a plasmid encoding the reverse sequence of the linker region between 91 and 104. In the first step, the DNA primer containing the codons for the amino acid sequence Ser-Asp-Val-Thr-Thr-Ile was inserted into the plasmid pLW01-b5mem Δ90-104. This plasmid had been mutated to remove the entire linker region. Addition of six amino acids produced plasmid pLW01-b5mem 91-96RSL, Δ97-104 that contained a reinserted Ser90 in addition to the last 5 residues of the wild type linker region in reverse order. In the second step, the primer containing the codons for the amino acid sequence Leu-Thr-Glu-Met-Pro was inserted into the pLW01-b5mem 91-96RSL, Δ97-104 to yield the plasmid pLW01-b5mem 91-100 RSL, Δ101-104. This new plasmid contained the last 10 residues of the cyt b5 wild type linker region in reverse order. In the final step, a primer containing the DNA for the amino acid sequence Lys-Ser-Leu-Lys was inserted into pLW01-b5mem 91-100 RSL, Δ101-104 to ultimately construct pLW01-b5mem 91-104 RSL, a plasmid containing the 14 residues of the wild type linker region in reverse order. The primers for each mutant are shown in Table I and had lengths of 41-44 bases.Table IThe DNA sequence of the 5‘-3‘ oligonucleotide primers used to mutate cytochrome b5Forward primeraTemplate plasmidMutantGATGACAGATCAAAA-AAGCCcatggAaactctTatcpLW01-b5mempLW01-Δ92-93CTCTTATCACCACC-TCgAATTCCAGCTGGTGGpLW01-b5mempLW01-Δ103-104CCTATGGAAACTCTTATC-TCgAATTCCAGCTGGTGGpLW01-b5mempLW01-Δ101104GCAAGCCTATGGAAACT-TCgAATTCCAGCTGGTGGACCpLW01-b5mempLW01-Δ99-104CAAAATTGAGCAAGCCTATG-TCgAATTCCAGCTGGTGGACpLW01-b5mempLW01-Δ97-104GATCAAAATTGAGCAAG-TCcAATTCCAGCTGGTGGpLW01-Δ97-104pLW01-Δ95-104GACAGATCAAAATTG-TCcAATTCCAGCTGGTGGpLW01-Δ97-104pLW01-Δ93-104CGGATGACAGA-TCcAATTCCAGCTGGTGGpLW01-Δ97-104pLW01-Δ90-104CCGGATGACAGATCAGATGTCACCACCATCTCgAATTCCAGCTGpLW01-Δ90-104pLW01-91-96RSLbGTCACCACCATCCTTACTGAAATGCCTTCcAATTCCAGCTGpLW01-91-96RSLpLW01-91-100RSLCCTTACTGAAATGCCTAAGAGCTTGAAATCgAATTCCAGCTGpLW01-91-100RSLpLW01-91-104RSLCGGATGACAGATCAAAATTGAGC-ATGGAAACTCTTATCpLW01-b5mempLW01-Δ94-95delCAGATCAAAATTGAGCAAGGCTATGGAAACTCTTATCACCpLW01-b5mempLW01-P95AGACAGATCAAAATTGAGCGCGCCTATGGAAACTCTTATCACCpLW01-b5mempLW01-K94ACTTATCACCACCGTCGCCGCAGATTCgAATTCCAGCTGGpLW01-b5mempLW01-103 + 2ACTTATCACCACCGTCGCCGCAGCTGCGGATTCgAATTCCAGCTGGpLW01-b5mempLW01-103 + 4ACGCCGCAGCTGCAGCAGCAGCAGCAGATTCcAATTCCAGCTGpLW01-103 + 4ApLW01-103 + 8ACAGCAGCAGCAGCGGCGGCCGCGGATTCGAATTCCAGCTGGpLW01-103 + 8ApLW01-103 + 9AGATCAAAATTGGCCGCTGCTAGCAAGCCTATGGpLW01-103 + 9ApLW01-103 + 9A,92 + 3AGATCAAAATTGGCCGCTGCAGCCGCCGCTGCTAGpLW01-103 + 9A,92 + 3ApLW01-103 + 9A,92 + 7AaQuikChange mutagenesis kits require complementary forward and reverse primers.

A total of 16 alanines were inserted into wild type cyt b5 to investigate the effect of lengthening the cyt b5 linker region. Initially, the pLW01-b5mem plasmid was used to prepare the 103 + 2A or 103 + 4A mutant cyts b5, where either 2 or 4 alanines were inserted after Val103 at the C terminus of the linker. The plasmid, pLW01-b5mem 103 + 4A, was used to construct pLW01-b5mem 103 + 8A. The plasmid pLW01-b5mem102 + 8A was then used to construct the more stable pLW01-b5mem 103 + 9A plasmid. Additional alanines were then inserted after Leu92 at the N terminus of the linker. Plasmid pLW01-b5mem 103 + 9A was used as a template to construct pLW01-b5mem 103 + 9A,92 + 3A, resulting in a plasmid containing the cDNA for cyt b5 with 12 inserted alanines. This plasmid was then used to add a further 4 alanines after Leu92 to ultimately yield a plasmid pLW01-b5mem 103 + 9A,92 + 7A containing the cDNA for cyt b5 with 16 alanines inserted. Cyt b5 was expressed and purified as previously described (23). Briefly, cultures of competent Escherichia coli C41 or C43 cells were prepared and the required pLW01 plasmid was inserted according to standard procedures (22, 24). Colonies were grown on LB agar plates containing 100 μg/ml carbenicillin. Five colonies were selected and used to inoculate 500 ml of TB medium, which was incubated with shaking at 37 °C and 120 rpm until the A600 reached 0.37, at which time 10 μM isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyrano-side was added. Expression was continued for an additional 16-20 h and cells were harvested. C41 cells containing plasmids pLW01-b5mem Δ95-104, pLW01-b5mem Δ93-104, pLW01-b5mem Δ90-104, pLW01-b5mem 103 + 9A, pLW01-b5mem 103 + 9A,92 + 3A, and pLW01-b5mem 103 + 9A,92 + 7A expressed very little cyt b5. However, when these plasmids were expressed in C43 cells, =15 mg of cyt b5 were produced. After cell lysis and reconstitution of holo cyt b5 with hemin, the protein was purified to homogeneity using anion exchange chromatog-raphy on DEAE-cellulose (Whatman, Maidstone, United Kingdom) and size exclusion chromatography on Superdex G75 (Amersham Bio-sciences). The purity of all cyt b5 mutants was checked using SDS-PAGE. The majority of proteins showed a single band on acrylamide gels when stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Bio-Rad), although proteins expressed at very low levels showed the presence of minor bands. The protein concentration was measured using a dye-reagent protein assay (Bio-Rad), and the specific content of cyt b5 ranged from 39 to 54 nmol of cyt b5/mg of protein. Each purified mutant cyt b5 was analyzed by mass spectroscopy to confirm its molecular weight. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ioniza-tion (MALDI) mass spectroscopy was performed on a TOF-Spec 2E (Micromass-Waters, Manchester, United Kingdom) equipped with a time-lag focusing source. Protein samples were run in the linear mode using sinapinic acid as a matrix. An external calibration curve was used to determine the molecular weight of each cyt b5 with an error of °0.1%. The observed molecular weight was compared with the theoretical average molecular mass using the software tool PEPTIDEMASS from the ExPASy world wide web proteome server (25) (Table II). cyt P450 reductase plus cyt P450 2B4 were purified as described previously (9).Table IIExpression and molecular mass of purified rabbit cyt b5 mutantsMutant cyt b5Expressed in E. coli strainAmount of cyt b5 purified from 500 ml of cell cultureObserved mass (M + H+)aPredicted mass of mutantmgDaDaWild typeC415715,213 ± 1515,218Δ92-93C415115,013 ± 1515,002Δ103-104C4112214,989 ± 1514,995Δ94-95C41414,995 ± 1514,993Δ92-93,103-104C411614,800 ± 1514,788Δ101-104C411514,801 ± 1514,802Δ99-104C417014,581 ± 1514,575Δ97-104C411414,350 ± 1514,345Δ95-104C431814,118 ± 1514,117Δ93-104C433313,907 ± 1513,901Δ90-104C431213,580 ± 1513,57391-104RSC41515,221 ± 1515,218P95AC411015,193 ± 1515,191K94AC416415,156 ± 1515,160103 + 2AC417115,361 ± 1515,360103 + 4AC411515,491 ± 1515,502103 + 9AC43215,859 ± 1615,857103 + 9A,92 + 3AC43516,049 ± 1616,071103 + 9A,92 + 7AC43216,335 ± 1616,355aThe molecular masses of the proteins were determined using MALDI mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Open table in a new tab aThe molecular masses of the proteins were determined using MALDI mass spectrometry as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The spectral dissociation constant (Ks) of the cyt P450 2B4-cyt b5 complex was determined by measuring the type 1 spectral change (decrease in absorbance at 420 nm and increase in absorbance at 385 nm) occurring when cyt b5 is added to a solution of 0.3 μM cyt P450 2B4, 0.05% methoxyflurane, and 12 μM dilauroyl phosphatidylcholine (DLPC). The Type-1 spectral change reflects an alteration in the spin state of the heme iron from a low spin hexacoordinate heme to high spin pentacoordinate heme. The procedure used to measure the Ks between cyt P450 2B4 and cyt b5 is a modification of previously described methods (9, 26). Briefly, a saturated solution of methoxyflurane (0.1%) in 100 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol was prepared. The solution was vortexed vigorously for 30 s to ensure saturation of the buffer and then allowed to stand at room temperature for =15 min to permit excess methoxyflurane to coalesce into a separate phase and settle to the bottom of the tube. The reference and sample buffers were prepared by mixing the saturated solution of methoxyflurane with equal amounts of either 100 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol to prepare sample buffer, or 100 mM KPO4, 20% glycerol, 24μM DLPC to prepare reference buffer. A mixture containing 6 μM cyt P450 2B4 in 100 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, and 240 μM DLPC was incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and subsequently diluted 20-fold with sample buffer to yield a final concentration of 0.3 μM cyt P450, 20% glycerol, and 12 μM DLPC immediately prior to use. Absorbance measurements were performed on a Cary-3 dual beam spectrophotometer. The sample cuvette contained 1 ml of 100 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 0.3 μM cyt P450 2B4, 12 μM DLPC, and the reference cell contained 1 ml of 100 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 12 μM DLPC. The cuvettes were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C, and a base line was recorded. Cyt b5 (0.04-1.9 nmol) was carefully added to each cuvette. The cuvettes were then mixed by gentle inversion 6-10 times. After 2 min the spectrum was recorded between 350 and 550 nm. Although cyt b5 absorbs strongly at 412 nm with an e412 of 117 mM-1 cm-1, the presence of an equal amount of cytochrome b5 in both the sample and reference cuvettes meant that only the cyt P450 2B4 spectrum was observed. The spectral changes were stable for 15 min, and the total absorbance change was determined by subtracting the absorbance decrease at 420 nm from the absorbance increase at 385 nm. Because protein precipitation in the cuvette and/or imperfect pipetting of cyt b5 may lead to significant error, it was necessary to examine the difference spectrum to ensure it reflected a type 1 spectral change and not precipitation or loss of cyt P450 2B4 or cyt b5. Data were considered acceptable if the absorbance decrease at 420 nm accounted for 60-70% of the total absorbance change between 420 and 385 nm and the isosbestic point of the spectral change was between 402 and 407 nm. Values that did not fall in this range were discarded. The spectral dissociation constant (Ks) was determined using Equation 1 (9).ΔA=ΔAmax[(Ks+[P0]+[B0])2−(Ks+[P0]+[B0])24−[P0][B0]](Eq.1) In Equation 1 ΔA is the observed absorbance change; ΔAmax is the maximal absorbance change per unit of cyt P450; [P0] is the concentration of cyt P450; [B0] is the concentration of cyt b5, and Ks is the spectral dissociation constant of the cyt P450 2B4-cyt b5 complex. The method used to measure the rate of methoxyflurane metabolism by cyt P450 2B4 in the presence and absence of cyt b5 is a modification of a previously described procedure (7). The reaction components were added to a reaction mixture in a specific sequence: 50 mM KPO4, pH 7.4, 10 μM cyt P450 2B4, 10 μM cyt P450 reductase, 0-90 μM cyt b5, and 1.9 mM DLPC. The mixtures were incubated for 1 h at room temperature before aliquots were added to assay tubes containing glucose 6-phosphate and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The final volume of the reaction mixtures was 450 μl and contained 50 mM KPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, 1 μM cyt P450 2B4, 1 μM cyt P450 reductase, 0-9 μM cyt b5, 190 μM DLPC, 5 mM glucose 6-phosphate, and 5 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction mixtures were pre-incubated for 5 min at 37 °C before addition of NADPH to a final concentration of 66 μM. The reaction mixtures were agitated at 37 °C and 120 rpm in an Innova 4200 orbital incubator shaker (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by immersion in a 70 °C water bath for 2 min. 22 μl of acetate buffer, containing 2.5 m NaOH and 5 M acetic acid, were added to each tube, and the fluoride concentration of a 300-/xl aliquot was measured using a fluoride ion electrode (Orion Research Inc., Beverly, MA). The concentration of fluoride in each sample was determined by comparison to a standard curve of 1-100 μM sodium fluoride. The apparent Km (Kmapp) of cyt b5 for cyt P450 2B4 was determined by fitting the rate of methoxyflurane metabolism at different [cyt b5] to Equation 2.v=v0+Vmax[b5]Kmapp+[b5](Eq.2) v and Vmax are the observed and maximal rate of fluoride formation, respectively; v0 is the rate of fluoride ion formation in the absence of cyt b5; and [b5] is the concentration of cyt b5. Hepatic microsomes from rabbits pretreated with phenobarbital were incubated with varying concentrations (0-10 nmol/mg of microsomal protein) of purified wild type and mutant cyts b5 at 37 °C for 30 min with shaking. The endogenous cyt b5 and cyt P450 content of the microsomes was 1.2 and 2.3 nmol/mg of microsomal protein, respectively. The microsomes were a gift from Drs. Paul Hollenberg and Ute Kent, University of Michigan. The final microsomal protein concentration was 2 mg/ml in 50 mM KPO4 buffer, pH 7.4. After 30 min Na2CO3, pH 11.5, was added to a final concentration of 0.1 M (27). Incubation was continued for an additional 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 100,000 X g for 30 min to pellet the membranes. The supernatant was collected, and the pellet was washed with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. The concentration of cyt b5 in the pellet and supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically after reduction with dithionite using an extinction coefficient of 185 cm-1 mM-1 for the absorbance change, which occurs at 426 - 409 nm (Δe426 _ 409nm = 185 cm-1 mM-1) when cyt b5 was reduced by dithionite. The cyt b5 concentration was corrected for the contribution of cyt P450 in the microsomes (28). Cyt b5 is an amphipathic protein, which contains an NH2-terminal heme domain anchored to the membrane by a COOH-terminal transmembrane a-helix. The two domains are connected by °15 amino acids, which are referred to as the linker domain. To gain an understanding of the role of the length and sequence of the linker region of cyt b5 in orienting the heme domain for its interaction with its redox partners, the length and sequence of the cyt b5 linker domain were altered using site-directed mutagenesis. The length and sequence of the putative cyt b5 linker region vary depending on the species. It was therefore necessary to define the borders of the linker region by identifying both the COOH terminus of the heme domain and the NH2 terminus of the membrane domain. The amino acid sequence alignment of cyt b5 from mammals, invertebrates, and plants (Fig. 1) demonstrates that the heme domain is highly conserved (40-95%). The crystal structures for the soluble domains of both bovine cyt b5 (1CYO) (7) and rat outer mitochondrial membrane cyt b5 (1B5M) (15) have been solved and show that the root mean square deviation of the backbone atoms of the heme domain differ by only 0.6 °. However, it was noted that the secondary structure of the COOH-terminal region of the two cyts b5 was significantly different. In the crystal structure of bovine cyt b5 residues Pro86-Arg89 form an α-helix, whereas in the rat outer mitochondrial membrane cyt b5 these residues are part of a random coil. In addition, the NMR-determined structure of bovine cyt b5 showed that the secondary structure became increasingly disordered after Pro86. Examination and comparison of the crystallographically and NMR-determined structures of the similar but nonidentical solubilized heme domains of bovine, rabbit, rat microsomal, and rat outer mitochondrial cyt b5 indicated that observable secondary structure in the heme domain ends near Arg89, which is 7 amino acids further along from the invariant Gly80. Thus, the NH2 terminus of the linker region was considered to be Ser90. As the amino acid sequence alignment of cyt b5 from mammals, invertebrates, and plants (Fig. 1) demonstrates that the heme domain is highly conserved (40-95%), it was assumed that the NH2 terminus of the linker region would begin in the same position in other cyt b5 sequences. The lipid bilayer consists of a hydrophobic core of =30° flanked by = 6 ° of interfacial polar head groups. To determine the position of the COOH terminus of the cyt b5 linker region, the approximate position of the NH2 terminus of the trans-membrane domain was identified (20). The membrane protein explorer program, MPEx, has been shown to locate the membrane binding domain of membrane proteins of known structure with an accuracy of 99% (21). The 19-amino acid core of the cyt b5 transmembrane helix was readily identified by MPEx, which calculates the free energy (δGWOCT) required to transfer a sequence of 19 amino acids from water to a hydro"

Bacteriophage T4 encodes almost all of the proteins required for its own DNA replication, recombination, and repair. Both recombination and recombination repair in T4 rely on UvsX, a RecA-like recombinase. We show here that UvsX plus the T4-encoded helicase Dda suffice to rescue stalled T4 replication forks in vitro. This rescue is based on two sequential template-switching reactions that allow DNA replication to bypass a non-coding DNA lesion in a non-mutagenic manner. The rescue of stalled replication forks via a series of steps that include fork regression, template switching, and fork restoration often has been proposed as a major mechanism for accurately bypassing non-coding DNA lesions. Bacteriophage T4 encodes almost all of the proteins required for its own DNA replication, recombination, and repair.

We show here that UvsX plus the T4-encoded helicase Dda suffice to rescue stalled T4 replication forks in vitro. This rescue is based on two sequential template-switching reactions that allow DNA replication to bypass a non-coding DNA lesion in a non-mutagenic manner. DNA template-strand lesions that prevent the extension of primer strands are usually lethal. Four general mechanisms operate to overcome such lethality: direct repair that regenerates a native structure (e.g. photoreaction and dealkylation), excision repair that replaces damaged bases or deoxyribose residues, translesion synthesis that is usually mutation-prone, and recombination repair that accurately bypasses DNA damage. The essence of recombination repair is that it derives accurate genetic information from the nascent sister chromatid (or from a homologous chromosome when repairing a double strand break); excision repair, on the other hand, derives the requisite genetic information from the complementary strand of the same double helix. Recombination repair was first characterized in Escherichia coli (1Rupp W.D. Howard-Flanders P. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 31: 291-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 2Smith K.C. Muen D.H.C. J.

The classical E. coli breakreunion model holds that blocked primer extension is followed by downstream reinitiation, leaving a gap that is then filled at least in part by the physical donation of a strand of appropriate polarity cut from the sister chromatid. The donating strand gap is filled by DNA synthesis, whereas the blocking lesion remains as a problem for the future. Recent progress in understanding recombination repair, based mainly on work with E. coli, has highlighted its importance for rescuing replication forks stalled at sites of DNA damage or spontaneous fork collapse (8Michel B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8181-8188Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 9Cox M.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2001; 35: 53-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 10Lusetti S.L.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 859-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). One model of recombination repair (Fig. 1) invokes a topological rearrangement in which the fork regresses into a configuration in which the parental strands reanneal and the two daughter strands anneal. This rearrangement generates a structure that constitutes a Holliday junction and that to some resembles a chicken foot (12Postow L. Ullsperger C. Keller R.W. Bustamante C. Vologodskii A.V. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2790-2796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the case of a primer strand whose extension is blocked by a lesion in the template strand, fork regression provides a template that allows limited primer extension. Subsequent reformation of a conventional replication fork then provides a primer strand that has accurately bypassed the template lesion. This pathway was named replication repair and was initially suggested to occur during mammalian DNA replication (5Higgins N.P. Kato K. Strauss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 101: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It was later validated by genetical and enzymological analyses in phage T4 (6Wachsman J.T. Drake J.W. Genetics. 1987; 115: 405-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25247-25255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In addition to a DNA polymerase, the canonical model of replication repair (Fig. 1) immediately suggests roles for a DNA helicase and a DNA recombinase to drive template switching. Phage T4 encodes a single DNA polymerase, gp43, a single DNA recombinase, UvsX, and three DNA helicases. gp41 is a replicative 5′ → 3′ DNA helicase (13Hinton D.M. Silver L.L. Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12851-12857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UvsW is a 3′ → 5′ DNA/RNA and DNA/DNA helicase that is probably involved in DNA recombination and repair (14Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2706-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and whose biochemical properties are not well understood because a soluble version of the native protein has resisted isolation; nonetheless, a crystallographic structure is available for part of UvsW (16Sickmier E.A. Kreuzer K.N. White S.W. Structure. 2004; 12: 583-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The third helicase, Dda (17Debreceni N. Behme M.T. Ebisuzaki K. Biochem.

Hacker K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When dda is combined with an amber mutation in gene 59, which encodes the gp41 helicase loader, the double mutant cannot synthesize DNA under non-permissive conditions (22Gauss P. Park K. Spencer T.E. Hacker K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Dda interacts both functionally and physically with UvsX (19Kodadek T. Alberts B.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 23Formosa T. Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2442-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Here we describe how UvsX recombinase and Dda helicase can rescue stalled replication forks by redirecting DNA synthesis conducted by the T4 DNA polymerase when the polymerase encounters a blocking lesion in the template strand. This redirection is based on two sequential template-switching reactions that allow T4 DNA replication to bypass a non-coding DNA lesion. Proteins—Overproduction and purification of phage T4 gp32, gp43, gp43D219A, gp44/62, gp59, UvsX, and UvsY were as described previously (7Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25247-25255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 24Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29559-29566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). gp41 and gp45 were purified as described previously (24Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29559-29566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with modifications to be described elsewhere. Proteins were monitored during purification by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie R-250 staining. T4 Dda helicase was a generous gift from Dr. Kevin Raney (University of Arkansas, Little Rock, AR). Replication Repair and Helicase Assays—Gel-purified oligonucleotides were from Oligos Etc. (Wilsonville, OR) and, when necessary, were 5′-32P-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. To prepare the standard forked substrate for replication repair and helicase assays, 120-mer “1” and 5′-32P-labeled 76-mer “3” were annealed with 94-mer “2” and 120-mer “4,” respectively, in separate 20-μl mixtures containing annealing buffer (80 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 200 mm potassium glutamate, 25 mm magnesium acetate, and 20 mm dithiothreitol) and 75 nm each oligonucleotide at 45 °C for 10 min. The two mixtures were then combined, diluted with annealing buffer to a final concentration of 26.66 nm, and incubated at 40 °C for 5 min; the annealed forked DNA was used immediately. When one or more of the four oligonucleotides were omitted or changed, the annealing procedure was the same. The standard replication repair reaction was conducted at 37 °C for 10 min in a 40-μl mixture containing 20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.8, 50 mm potassium glutamate, 17.5 mm KCl, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol (v/v), 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm dATP, 0.2 mm dTTP, 0.2 mm dGTP, 1 mm ATP, 2 nm forked DNA, 0.6 nm gp43, 0.7 nm gp44/62, 4 nm gp45, 62.5 nm Dda, and 375 nm UvsX. Sometimes gp32, gp41, gp59, and/or UvsY was included at indicated concentrations. After 10 min of incubation, 7-μl samples were mixed with 10 μl of 90% formamide plus 10 mm EDTA and analyzed by denaturing electrophoresis in 6% polyacrylamide gel (PAG) 1The abbreviations used are: PAG, polyacrylamide gel; nt, nucleotide. containing 6 m urea. In some cases, products were analyzed by electrophoresis in native 8% PAG in 0.8× Tris borate buffer (72 mm Tris-OH, 72 mm borate, 0.8 mm EDTA). SDS and Proteinase K were added to the 10-min reaction products to final concentrations of 0.1% and 0.333 mg/ml, respectively, and digestion was allowed at 37 °C for 25–30 min. Products were separated in 1.5-mm native gels at 250 V for 2 h at room temperature. The standard helicase assay was the same as the standard template-switching reaction except that dATP, dGTP, dTTP, gp43, gp44/62, and gp45 were omitted. To prevent reannealing of the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide after stopping the reaction, 10-fold molar excesses of the same unlabelled oligonucleotide plus SDS and Proteinase K were added. Digestion with Proteinase K and separation of products in native PAG were carried out as described above. Denaturing and native gels were transferred onto Whatman 3MM paper and DEAE paper, respectively, and dried. Data collection and quantification were performed using a Storm 850 PhosphorImager and the ImageQuaNT™ program (Amersham Biosciences). To determine whether T4 UvsX recombinase and a DNA helicase can rescue stalled T4 replication forks by a replication-repair mechanism (Fig. 1), we designed an artificial replication fork. This fork has the configuration and sequence shown in the top four sequences of Fig. 2A and has normal strand complementarities except for the blocking lesion. The lesion consists of an abasic site that is followed immediately by a template base (G) that cannot easily serve as a template because the reaction mixture is devoid of dCTP (which is needed nowhere else in the reaction). This double lesion effectively abolishes translesion synthesis (7Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25247-25255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The other key feature of the DNA substrate is that the second switch is likely to start when the extension of strand 3 reaches or penetrates the template pentaribonucleotide 5′-rArCrCrUrU-3′, which is characteristic of the primers that initiate lagging strands in T4 replication forks (25Liu C.C. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5698-5702Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 26Nossal N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2176-2182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although strand switching was modestly promoted by the UvsX recombinase in the absence of a helicase (7Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25247-25255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), exploratory experiments described below revealed that the reaction was not promoted by the T4 gp41 helicase. However, T4 encodes two more helicases. UvsW is an RNA/DNA as well as a DNA/DNA helicase (14Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N.

Spencer T.E. Hacker K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 1667-1672Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, Dda interacts with UvsX; Dda is retained by a UvsX affinity column (23Formosa T. Burke R.L. Alberts B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2442-2446Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and it stimulates UvsX-mediated strand exchange (19Kodadek T. Alberts B.M. Nature. 1987; 326: 312-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We therefore inquired as to whether the T4 Dda helicase might promote template switching catalyzed by UvsX. When the gp43 DNA polymerase, the gp44/62 clamp loader, and the gp45 clamp are incubated with the artificial replication fork, the extension of strand 3 is blocked by the abasic site, and a 79-nt product accumulates (Fig. 2B, lane 2). Including either UvsX or Dda in the reaction promoted the formation of products containing 90–91 nt. UvsX is more efficient than Dda in promoting this first template switch (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4, and Fig. 2C). Thus, either UvsX or Dda can promote single template switches, but neither promotes the second switch required for replication repair with appreciable efficiency. Because strand 2 contains 89 deoxyribonucleotides followed by five ribonucleotides, the observation of products slightly longer than 89 nt was unexpected and suggests that gp43 has a weak reverse-transcriptase activity. The chance that the pentaribonucleotide portion of the substrate was contaminated with deoxyribonucleotides at its 3′-end is small because the majority rather than a minority of the products exceeded 89 nt and because the gp43 exonuclease deficiency described below promoted even longer products. If replication repair occurs, it will generate a 120-nt product via double switching (Fig. 2A). When both UvsX and Dda were included in the reaction, the 120-nt product appeared (Fig. 2B, lane 5, and Fig. 2C). This product was also observed to the same extent when all four dNTPs at 50 μm were included in the reaction, thus reducing the blocking lesion to the abasic site (data not shown). No extension of strand 3 was detected when both UvsX and Dda were included in the absence of the T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme, excluding the possibility that UvsX and/or Dda preparations contain a contaminating DNA polymerase capable of bypassing the template lesion (data not shown). Thus, UvsX and Dda together promote double template switching by the T4 DNA polymerase holoenzyme to circumvent a template lesion in vitro. The time course of the template-switching reaction showed that the 120-nt product was already observed after 5 min (Fig. 2D). When either Dda or UvsX was omitted, hardly any template switching was observed even after 30 min. These results emphasize that both Dda and UvsX are required to rescue T4 replication forks in vitro by replication repair. In the reaction with Dda alone, an ∼101-nt product was also observed (Fig. 2B, lane 3). This product can form because the pentanucleotide repeat in strand 4 (Fig. 2A) allows 3′-ends of strand 3 extended to 79 nt to be unwound by Dda and then to reanneal with the downstream copy of the repeat, to be trimmed to 78 nt when the gp43 3′-exonuclease removes the mispaired terminal T, and then to be extended to 101 nt. The deletion comprises one copy of the 5-nt repeat plus the intervening 14 nt (including the 2-nt blocking lesion) (120 - 5 - 14 = 101). (The 101-nt product is not seen with the Exo- polymerase, presumably because the terminal mismatch is difficult to extend.) Thus, Dda may mediate deletion mutagenesis in response to DNA damage, and overproduction of Dda might promote deletions between repetitive sequences. Indeed, overproduction of UvrD, a helicase unrelated to Dda, promotes deletions between tandem repeats via induction of the RecF recombination pathway (28Bierne H. Seigneur M. Ehrlich S.D. Michel B. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 557-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We next explored how the composition of the DNA substrate affects replication repair (Fig. 3). As expected, no 120-nt product appeared when the damaged template strand was omitted (Fig. 3, lane 2), when the other daughter strand (the lagging strand) was omitted (lane 3), when both parental strands were omitted (lane 6), when both sister-chromosome strands were omitted (lane 7), or when all but the leading strand were omitted (lane 10). Omitting the lagging strand template increased the yield of the 120-nt product (Fig. 3, lane 4) in accord with previous reports that T4 replication plus recombination proteins can catalyze conservative DNA replication (29Formosa T. Alberts B.M. Cell. 1986; 47: 793-806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 30Bleuit J.S. Xu H. Ma Y. Wang T. Liu J. Morrical S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8298-8305Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Replacing the 94-nt hybrid RNA-DNA lagging strand with a 90-nt DNA strand did not alter the efficiency of template switching (Fig. 3, lane 8), indicating that a DNA terminus is as efficient as an RNA oligomer in promoting the second switch. Decreasing the length of the lagging strand from 94 to 86 nt while preserving its RNA-DNA hybrid nature abolished the second switch (Fig. 3, lane 9), suggesting that the 82–84-nt products of the first template switch are not long enough to bridge the two nontemplating residues after residue 79 and then to support the second switch by forming only 1–3 base pairs. Replacing gp43 with the exonuclease-deficient derivative gp43D219A had no strong effects on the reactions (compare the left-hand and right-hand gels in Fig. 3), indicating that the exonuclease activity does not affect replication repair. The only difference was that the products of the first switch were somewhat longer than those with the wild-type gp43, which suggests that the proofreading exonuclease restricts the reverse transcriptase activity of gp43. The combined results indicate that the replication-repair reaction absolutely requires the damaged template of the leading strand plus the alternative template lagging strand, which must be sufficiently long to provide more than 3 base pairs to support the second switch. We next analyzed the effects of Dda and UvsX concentrations on replication repair. The optimal concentration of UvsX was about 375 nm, above which template switching declined sharply (Fig. 4A). The optimal concentration of Dda was reached at about 62.5 nm, and increasing the concentration to 125 nm had no effect (Fig. 4B). When the concentration of the holoenzyme (gp43, gp45, and gp44/62) was increased by 4-fold, the yield of the 120-nt double-switch product was increased about 3-fold; however, when the holoenzyme concentration was increased 16-fold, the yield of the 120-nt product decreased sharply (data not shown). We also examined the effects of the concentration of the forked DNA substrate on replication repair. As expected, increasing the concentration of the substrate increased the yield of the double-switch product (Fig. 4C). The yield of the product increased almost linearly with the substrate over the tested range, showing that the double-switch reaction is not forced by high protein/DNA ratios. We next asked whether template switching occurs while the replication fork retains its four-stranded structure or after its two arms have been unwound. For the latter case, Dda and UvsX would have to unwind both arms in helicase assays to produce the 120-nt product. However, Dda (either alone or with UvsX) could only unwind the lesion-bearing arm with a 5′-single-stranded DNA tail (Fig. 5A, left-hand gel). This result is consistent with a previous demonstration that Dda loads onto 5′-tails of duplex DNA and unwinds the DNA in the 5′ → 3′ direction (21Nanduri B. Byrd A.K. Eoff R.L. Tackett A.J. Raney K.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14722-14727Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Neither Dda nor UvsX nor both together were able to unwind either the other arm of the replication fork (Fig. 5A, middle gel) or the expected product of the first template-switching reaction (Fig. 5A, right-hand gel), each of which has 3′-tails. Thus, template switching occurs on the four-stranded replication fork prior to its unwinding to the two arms, and the four-stranded structure of the replication fork facilitates template switching. We also characterized the products of replication-repair reactions by nondenaturing PAG electrophoresis. As expected, incubating the DNA fork without proteins yielded a major band corresponding to the unmodified four-stranded substrate but no band corresponding to free 32P-labeled strand 3 (Fig. 5B, lane 1). In addition, small amounts of radioactivity were distributed in a manner consistent with the supposition that the small size of the fork plus spontaneous branch migration of forked (Y-type) DNA would convert some forks to derivatives during fork preparation, incubation in the reaction, and/or separation in PAG; spontaneous branch migration has been described previously (31Panyutin I.G. Hsieh P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2021-2025Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The presence of these derivatives does not affect our conclusion that the double-switching reaction requires the concerted action of UvsX and Dda because all derivatives of the fork observed in the control reaction (Fig. 5B, lane 1) are also main products of reactions that included either Dda (Fig. 5B, lane 3) or UvsX (Fig. 5B, lane 3). In addition, neither UvsX nor Dda alone promotes replication repair (Fig. 2C and Fig. 4, A and B). Incubating the DNA substrate with the holoenzyme proteins had no visible impact on its structure (Fig. 5B, lane 2). When either Dda or UvsX was present in a reaction, some of the fork was converted into two 32P-labeled subspecies, a lesion-bearing duplex and a duplex containing the two daughter strands (Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4). The same products were also observed when the holoenzyme proteins were omitted from the reaction (data not shown), indicating that Dda and UvsX are sufficient for unwinding the fork. Including both Dda and UvsX in the reaction converted all substrate to the lesion-bearing duplex and the duplex containing the two daughter strands, the products of the first template-switching reaction (Fig. 5B, lane 5). The PAG mobility of the lesion-bearing duplex composed of strands 1 and 4 is very similar to the mobility of the lesion-bearing duplex composed of strands 3 and 4 (data not shown), so that gel analyses do not clearly distinguish between the fork structures before and after template switching (compare the mobilities of the middle major bands in Fig. 5B, lanes 3 and 4, where there is no template-switching product, with that in lane 5, where template-switching product is present). These results show that although replication repair requires the concerted action of Dda and UvsX, either protein can destabilize or unwind the fork. UvsY is an accessory protein that loads UvsX onto single-stranded DNA (32Harris L.D. Griffith J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 33Morrical S.W. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15096-15103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and gp32 contributes to DNA synthesis both by destabilizing DNA secondary structures and by binding to other replication proteins (34Nossal N.G. Karam J.D. The Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1994: 43-53Google Scholar). We therefore inquired as to whether UvsY and/or gp32 can modulate the replication-repair reaction. Adding 62.5 nm UvsY, 125 nm gp32, or both to the standard replication-repair mixture inhibited the reaction (data not shown). However, the effects were somewhat different when the UvsX concentration was decreased 2-fold. Under that condition, adding either protein still inhibited the reaction (Fig. 6, lanes 8 and 10), but adding both relieved the inhibition (Fig. 6, lane 9). This result is consistent with previous observations that UvsY helps to load UvsX onto DNA in the presence of competing gp32 (35Yonesaki T. Minagawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 7814-7820Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Jiang H. Giedroc D. Kodadek T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7904-7911Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also determined that gp32 cannot replace UvsX in the replication-repair reaction (data not shown). Finally, we inquired whether the T4 gp41 replicative helicase, alone or together with gp59, can replace Dda in the replication-repair reaction. We included gp59 in the analysis because it loads the gp41 helicase onto DNA (27Barry J. Alberts B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33049-33062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is required for single template switching driven by gp41 (7Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25247-25255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). When gp41 and gp59 were added to a reaction also containing UvsX and the polymerase holoenzyme proteins, the 120-nt double-switching product accumulated (Fig. 7, lane 5). Omitting either gp41 or gp59 abolished double switching, indicating the importance of both proteins in the reaction (Fig. 7, lanes 6 and 7). Varying the UvsX concentration at fixed concentrations of gp41 and gp59 and vice versa did not increase the efficiency of the reaction (data not shown). The maximum reaction efficiency in the presence of both gp41 and gp59 was about 5-fold less than in the standard reaction containing Dda. Thus, gp41 plus gp59 cannot efficiently replace Dda in the replication-repair reaction in vitro. Using an artificial replication fork, we have shown that UvsX and Dda helicase can rescue stalled phage T4 replication forks in vitro. Rescue is based on a mechanism that allows DNA replication to bypass non-coding DNA lesions via two sequential template-switching reactions (Figs. 1 and 2). When either UvsX or Dda is omitted, no replication repair occurs (Fig. 2); Dda can be replaced by the gp41 replicative helicase plus its gp59 loader, although inefficiently. A similar but single strand-switching process can be driven not by UvsX plus Dda but by the gp41 helicase plus the gp32 single-stranded DNA-binding protein (7Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25247-25255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). However, this process has been examined so far only using a replication fork designed in a way that prevented the second switch. A remarkable aspect of our results is that a genetic analysis of T4 survival after DNA damage revealed that the replication-repair alleles of genes 32 and 41 occupy a different epistasis group from the recombination-repair alleles of uvsX (6Wachsman J.T. Drake J.W. Genetics. 1987; 115: 405-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, because dda null alleles do not affect UV sensitivity (37Behme M.T. Ebisuzaki K. J. Virol. 1975; 15: 50-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it would appear that dda is not a member of the uvsX epistasis group. Another member of this epistasis group is uvsW, which encodes another helicase (14Carles-Kinch K. George J.W. Kreuzer K.N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4142-4151Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 15Dudas K.C. Kreuzer K.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2706-2715Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). uvsW mutations increase UV sensitivity by only about 1.34-fold, whereas uvsX and uvsY mutations increase sensitivity by about 1.57-fold (6Wachsman J.T. Drake J.W. Genetics. 1987; 115: 405-417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, Dda and UvsW may provide redundant helicase functions; in this case Dda might incompletely support replication repair in a uvsW mutant, and perhaps UvsW might completely support replication repair in a dda mutant. Determining whether both UvsX and UvsW support a replication-repair mode of recombination repair in vivo will require greater understanding of the relative roles of UvsW and Dda. Replication repair and other pathways of recombination repair accurately circumvent DNA lesions. Mutagenic DNA translesion synthesis is often conducted by specialized DNA polymerases, but not in T4, where gp43 seems to do the job (38Drake J.W. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1988; 214: 547-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, translesion synthesis is frequently accurate in vitro opposite DNA lesions that retain coding potential (39Kunkel T.A. Pavlov Y.I. Bebenek K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2003; 2: 135-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the rigorous characterization of translesion synthesis in vivo requires some understanding of the concomitant contribution of recombination repair to accurate lesion bypass. What are the relative contributions of the classical break-reunion mode of recombination repair and replication repair to survival? T4 encodes almost all of the proteins required for its own DNA transactions, and these proteins more closely resemble their counterparts in archaea and eukaryotes than in eubacteria (40Bernstein H. Bernstein C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2265-2270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite several decades of vigorous exploration of T4 repair mechanisms, there is a striking absence of any report of the kind of break-reunion recombination repair so well characterized in E. coli. In phage λ, which relies upon E. coli repair systems, as many as 20 dimers/genome were insufficient to block viral DNA replication in an unirradiated, excision-deficient E. coli cell in which the recA-dependent recombination functions were not induced and in which few recombinational exchanges occurred (41Defais M. Lesca C. Monsarrat B. Hanawalt P. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4938-4944Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This high survival seems unlikely to have been simple translesion synthesis because there is little mutagenesis in UV light-irradiated phage λ in the absence of UV irradiation of the host (42Weigle J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1953; 39: 628-636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); absent the induced level of classical recombination repair, the mechanism may have been replication repair. Further parallels between T4 and E. coli are suggested by studies that implicate the E. coli RegG and PriA helicases in a repair mode that also seems to be distinct from classical recombination repair (43McGlynn P. Lloyd R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8227-8234Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 44Gregg A.V. McGlynn P. Jaktaji R.P. Lloyd R.G. Mol.

There is a striking lack of published support for a break-reunion mode of recombination repair in yeast and mammalian cells, and at least in yeast, attempts to detect the classical mode did not do so (46Resnick M.A. Boyce J. Cox B. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 146: 285-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Resnick M.A. Stasiewicz S. Genetics. 1983; 104: 583-601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, as noted previously (7Kadyrov F.A. Drake J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25247-25255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), the yeast RAD5/6 epistasis group (48Broomfield S. Hryciw T. Xiao W. Mutat. Res. 2001; 486: 176-184Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar) encodes a mode of postreplication repair that is distinct from classical recombination repair and may well be replication repair, and genetical results (49Li Z. Xiao W. McCormick J.J. Maher V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4459-4464Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) suggest the operation of a human system for template switching that also resembles replication repair. Taken together, these reports invite the speculation that classical recombination repair is the dominant mode in eubacteria with replication repair playing a secondary role, whereas replication repair is the dominant mode in T4 and in eukaryotes. What, then, is the dominant mode in the archaea? We are grateful to Dr. Kevin Raney for the generous gift of Dda helicase. We thank Matt Longley and Ben Van Houten for critical comments on the manuscript."

Elevated levels of circulating chromogranins were found in patients with endocrine and neuroendocrine tumors, renal failure, and heart failure. Chromogranins and their metabolites were also found secreted into the cerebrospinal fluid in patients with neurological disorders. Intracellular roles for the chromogranins include the control of dense-core secretory granule formation, protein sorting, and Ca2+ storage. These functions may prove to be essential to neurons as the expression levels of chromogranin are altered in patients with Pick's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia (25Yasuhara O. Kawamata T. Aimi Y. McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 170: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recently the interaction of the InsP3R with CGA, CGB, or chromogranin A and B heteromer (CGAB) was shown to be functional using single channel and ion flux studies (12Thrower E. Park H. So S. Yoo S. Ehrlich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15801-15806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Thrower E.C. Choe C.U. So S.H. Jeon S.H. Ehrlich B.E. Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49699-49706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The molecular interaction of the InsP3R with CGB requires a 20 amino acid sequence near the N-terminal region of CGB (CGB fragment) and the L3-2 intraluminal loop of InsP3R (27Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30293-30300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that the CGB fragment can inhibit the functional interaction between CGAB and the InsP3R in single channel measurements. Moreover, we demonstrate that the binding of the CGB fragment alone is not sufficient to elicit the functional effect of full-length chromogranin. We also show that the functional interaction between CGAB and the InsP3R can be disrupted in vivo. Specifically, the expression of the CGB fragment in differentiated PC12 cells inhibits intracellular Ca2+ signaling, showing that the CGAB/InsP3R interaction amplifies Ca2+ signaling in this established neuron model (28Koizumi S. Bootman M.D. Bobanovic L.K. Schell M.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The ability to regulate the CGAB/InsP3R interaction will have important consequences for intracellular Ca2+ levels in all cells where these proteins are found. Plasmids—The cDNA encoding for the conserved near N-terminal CGB peptide with the sequence IIEVLSNALLKSSAPPITPE (residues 17–36) and the cDNA encoding for a scrambled peptide with the sequence LAPEPIEKLPTSAVILNSSI (same amino acids as the CGB fragment but randomized) were each subcloned into pShooter-pCMV/Myc/ER (Invitrogen). Both constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. A pcDNA3.1 DsRed2-N1 construct (Clontech) was co-transfected to verify transfection. For immunocytochemistry experiments, the pShooter-pCMV/GFP-Myc/ER vector (Invitrogen) was used. Cell Culture and Transfection—PC12 cells were maintained and propagated as described previously (29Johenning F.W. Zochowski M. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Koulen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2S. N. Jacob, C. U. Choe, M. Yeckel, and B. E. Ehrlich, submitted for publication. For Ca2+ imaging and immunocytochemistry experiments, PC12 cells were plated on collagen and poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips (BD Biocoat) at a concentration of 3.5 × 104 cells/ml. 20–30 h after plating, cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of pcDNA3.1 DsRed2-N1 cDNA and 1.5 μg of pShooter-pCMV/Myc/ER containing either the CGB fragment or the scrambled peptide. After transfection, PC12 growth medium was supplemented with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF, Alomone Laboratories). Cells were used after differentiation for 6 days and a confluency of 20%. Western Blot and Immunofluorescence—CGA and CGB were detected using standard Western blotting techniques (Santa Cruz goat CGA antibody at a 1:100 dilution and Santa Cruz mouse CGB antibody at a 1:100 dilution). After NGF differentiation for 6 days, cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized and blocked with 0.3% Triton X-100, 10% goat serum, and 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h. Primary antibodies (mouse anti-Myc and rabbit anti-calnexin) were used at a 1:100 dilution in PBS supplemented with 1% goat serum for 1 h, and secondary antibodies (anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594) were used at a 1:500 dilution in PBS supplemented with 1% goat serum for 1 h. Samples were examined using laser confocal microscopy (Zeiss LSM510 Meta). Ca2+Imaging—Confocal microscopy was used to measure intracellular Ca2+ in differentiated PC12 cells as described previously (29Johenning F.W. Zochowski M. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Koulen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2S. N. Jacob, C. U. Choe, M. Yeckel, and B. E. Ehrlich, submitted for publication. L15 medium was used as the extracellular solution. Most experiments were performed using extracellular medium containing 5 mm EGTA to deplete extracellular calcium. When comparisons were made between cells incubated with or without extracellular calcium, essentially the same result was obtained. After loading the PC12 cells with Fluo-4 AM, the dye was excited at 488 nm and the emission signal was detected at 522–535 nm. Images were recorded at a rate of 2–4 Hz at room temperature. Only fluorescent changes over somatic regions of differentiated and transfected (DsRed-positive) PC12 cells were analyzed. A 9:1 running average filter was applied to the representative traces shown (29Johenning F.W. Zochowski M. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Koulen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2S. N. Jacob, C. U. Choe, M. Yeckel, and B. E. Ehrlich, submitted for publication. The moving average filter is a simple low pass filter that can be imagined as a window of a nine-element size moving along the data array, one element at a time. The middle element of the window is replaced with the average of all of the elements in the window. Purification of the InsP3R—The mouse InsP3R type I was purified as described previously (31Thrower E.C. Mobasheri H. Dargan S. Marius P. Lea E.J. Dawson A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36049-36055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purified InsP3R was incorporated into liposomes by the addition of 100 μg of purified protein to 1 ml of liposome solution (consisting of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine (3:1) in bilayer buffer), mixing, and then incubating on ice for 10 min. Synthesis of the CGB Fragment and the Scrambled Peptide—The CGB fragment and the scrambled peptide were synthesized by a small scale peptide synthesis using a Rainin Symphony instrument that provides on instrument cleavage of the peptide from the resin. Crude peptides were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC profile and a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrum. Purified peptides were a minimum of 99% pure based on the accompanying absorbance profile from an analytical reverse-phase HPLC run performed on an aliquot of the purified pool. Bilayer Experiments—InsP3R channel activity in planar bilayers was monitored and analyzed as described previously (12Thrower E. Park H. So S. Yoo S. Ehrlich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15801-15806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Thrower E.C. Choe C.U. So S.H. Jeon S.H. Ehrlich B.E. Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49699-49706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The two compartments are defined as cis (corresponding to the cytosol) and trans (corresponding to the ER lumen). After adding a mixture of CGA/CGB (1:1) to the luminal compartment, InsP3R channel activity was recorded at 0 mV in the presence of increasing concentrations of the CGB fragment or the scrambled peptide. The CGB Fragment Inhibits the CGAB/InsP3R Functional Coupling in Vitro—The effect of the CGB fragment on the functional coupling of CGAB and InsP3R was investigated at the single channel level using purified InsP3R incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Under control conditions, in the presence of 300 nm cytosolic-free Ca2+ and 2 μm InsP3, InsP3R single channel activity was observed (Fig. 1A, trace I) with a current amplitude of ∼2 pA and an open probability of 3.0 ± 0.7% (n = 4). After the addition of CGAB to the luminal compartment (10 nm of final concentration), a dramatic change in channel activity was observed (Fig. 1A, trace II). The magnitude of the single channel current was unaltered, but the open probability increased dramatically to 19 ± 2% (n = 3). After activating the channel by the addition of InsP3 to the cytoplasmic side and CGAB to the luminal side, the CGB fragment was added to the luminal chamber. Channel activity was recorded over a CGB fragment concentration range of 0.001–60 μm. Increasing the CGB fragment concentration up to 0.05 μm had no effect on the open probability (Fig. 1A, trace III), but further additions of the CGB fragment decreased the open probability. Maximal activity dropped to 3%, the value for the open probability before the addition of CGAB, over the concentration range of 0.1–6 μm (Fig. 1, A, traces IV and V, and C). Subsequent additions of the CGB fragment up to 60 μm had no further effect on the open probability (Fig. 1A, trace VI). The absolute open probability values were plotted as a function of the CGB fragment concentration, and an IC50 of ∼470 nm CGB fragment was calculated (Fig. 1C; n = 4). As a control, the effect of a scrambled peptide (the 20 amino acids of the CGB fragment but randomized) was compared with the effects of the CGB fragment. In the presence of 10 nm luminal CGAB, 300 nm cytosolic-free Ca2+, and 2 μm cytosolic InsP3 and in the absence of the scrambled peptide, the single channel activity was similar to that observed before the addition of CGB fragment (compare Fig. 1, A and B; an open probability of 21 ± 3%; n = 3). The addition of the scrambled peptide over the entire concentration range tested (0.05–30 μm) elicited no significant change in the open probability (Fig. 1, B and D). The effect of the CGB fragment on the activity of the InsP3R in the absence of CGAB was also tested. After the addition of 500 nm CGB fragment to the luminal side of the channel, the single channel current and the open probability (3.0% ± 1.0%; n = 3) were unchanged (Fig. 1E). Expression of Endogenous Chromogranin and Heterologous Proteins in NGF-treated PC12 Cells—The experiments shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the CGB fragment modulates the InsP3R in vitro. We next tested whether this CGB fragment also altered Ca2+ signaling in vivo. First, the endogenous expression of CGA and CGB in PC12 cells was confirmed. PC12 cells were treated with NGF for 6 days, and the presence of CGA and CGB in cell homogenates was detected using Western blot analysis (Fig. 2A). Chinese hamster ovary cells were used as a negative control (Fig. 2A). Second, to verify that NGF-treated PC12 cells would express the CGB fragment as the cells differentiated to a neuron-like morphology, we monitored the level of GFP expression over a 6-day period. The expression of GFP was limited to the ER by using a vector with both ER localization and retention signals along with a Myc epitope (described under “Experimental Procedures”). This same construct was used for the heterologous expression of the CGB fragment discussed below. GFP expression was similar in NGF-treated PC12 cells on days 2, 4, and 6 post-transfection (Fig. 2B). Localization of the CGB Fragment and Scrambled Peptide in NGF-treated PC12 Cells—To express the CGB fragment or the scrambled peptide, PC12 cells were transiently transfected with the vector containing ER localization and retention signals along with a Myc epitope (Fig. 3A). After transfection, the cells were treated for 6 days with NGF. To show the localization of the peptide, cells were stained with an anti-Myc antibody. To show the extent of the ER, the cells were co-stained with an anti-calnexin antibody. Fluorescence signals for both compounds were found throughout the soma and the neurites (Fig. 3B). The overlap of the signals (Fig. 3B, right panel) suggests that the two proteins are in the same compartment, which the calnexin stain reveals to be the ER. Inhibition of the CGAB/InsP3R Interaction Results in Decreased Ca2+Signaling—To investigate the effect of the CGB fragment in vivo, PC12 cells were transiently co-transfected with a DsRed construct and the empty vector, the CGB fragment, or the scrambled peptide (Fig. 3A). The CGB fragment and scrambled peptide were identical to the peptides used for bilayer experiments. After NGF treatment for 6 days, only differentiated and transfected PC12 cells, which were well loaded with the Ca2+ indicator dye, were used for Ca2+ imaging (Fig. 4A). Cells were stimulated for 2 min with 500 μm carbachol, and the magnitude of the Ca2+ rise over the soma was measured (Fig. 4B). The peak Ca2+ amplitude (Fmax/F0) in cells transfected with the empty vector was 2.4 ± 0.3 (n = 11), and for cells transfected with the scrambled peptide, the peak Ca2+ amplitude was 2.2 ± 0.2 (Fig. 4B; n = 13). There was no significant difference between these two groups of cells (Fig. 4C; p = 0.84). In contrast, transfection with the CGB fragment elicited peak Ca2+ amplitudes of 1.6 ± 0.1 (n = 17), a response that was significantly different from cells expressing the scrambled peptide (p < 0.03) or cells transfected with the empty vector (p < 0.04) (Fig. 4, B and C). To test whether the intracellular calcium stores were intact and viable, PC12 cells transiently transfected with either the empty vector or the CGB fragment were stimulated with 10 mm caffeine or treated with thapsigargin. The percent of cells responding to stimulation by caffeine was similar for cells transfected with the empty vector (55%) and those transfected with the CGB fragment (53%). The amplitude and time course for the Ca2+ transient also was similar for cells transfected with the empty vector (n = 11) or with CGB fragment (n = 19) (Fig. 5, A and B). Similarly, the amplitude and time course for the Ca2+ transient was similar after the addition of thapsigargin. These results show that the stores were fully functional, even after transient expression of a protein fragment of CGB in the lumen of the ER. In this paper, we describe experiments where the addition of a CGB fragment was tested on the InsP3R channel activity and on Ca2+ signaling in intact cells. We found that the CGB fragment alone does not elicit the effect of the full-length CGAB on the open probability of the InsP3R but that it does inhibit the functional interaction of CGAB on the InsP3R. The inhibition was determined to be specific, because a scrambled peptide with the same amino acid composition as the CGB fragment had no effect (Fig. 1, B and D). Because the molecular interaction of the CGB fragment with the InsP3R has been shown (27Yoo S.H. Lewis M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30293-30300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to conclude that the inhibitory effect is the result of competition between the CGB fragment and CGAB for the same binding site on the InsP3R. Therefore, the CGB fragment can be used as a specific tool to inhibit the functional coupling of CGAB with the InsP3R. Similarly, the expression of the CGB fragment in neuronally differentiated PC12 cells resulted in a reduction in the peak amplitude of the Ca2+ signal after stimulation of PC12 cells with carbachol (Fig. 4, B and C). Given the single channel results and the presence of intact intracellular calcium stores in transfected PC12 cells, the CGB fragment appears to inhibit the functional coupling of CGAB to the luminal portion of the InsP3R (Fig. 5). This finding suggests that the interaction of CGAB with the InsP3R is necessary for the normal physiological response and is an important component of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores by the InsP3R. Moreover, the potential to modulate the binding of CGAB to the InsP3R suggests a powerful means of regulating Ca2+ signaling in this established neuronal model (28Koizumi S. Bootman M.D. Bobanovic L.K. Schell M.J. Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Neuron. 1999; 22: 125-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and in all cells where these proteins are found. Interestingly, if the expression levels of CGA and CGB are reduced by RNA interference techniques, ER formation is inhibited, showing that the chromogranins are important for ER function (32Huh Y.H. Jeon S.H. Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40581-40589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the binding of CGAB to the InsP3R is pH-dependent and that the functional effects on channel activity correlate with the binding of the two proteins (12Thrower E. Park H. So S. Yoo S. Ehrlich B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15801-15806Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Thrower E.C. Choe C.U. So S.H. Jeon S.H. Ehrlich B.E. Yoo S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49699-49706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, it is reasonable to assume that very specific subcellular distribution patterns of chromogranin and modulation of its expression will shape Ca2+ signal initiation and wave propagation (29Johenning F.W. Zochowski M. Conway S.J. Holmes A.B. Koulen P. Ehrlich B.E. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 5344-5353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).2 This binding of the chromogranin to the InsP3R stabilizes the channel properties in a manner similar to that described for the FK506-binding protein 12 association with the ryanodine receptor (33Brillantes A.-M.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). The increases in single channel mean open time and open probability in vitro and the amplification of Ca2+ signaling in vivo are similar to those seen for the FK 506-binding protein 12/ryanodine receptor complex (33Brillantes A.-M.B. Ondrias K. Scott A. Kobrinsky E. Ondriasova E. Moschella M.C. Jayaraman T. Landers M. Ehrlich B.E. Marks A.R. Cell. 1994; 77: 513-523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). Assuming that the CGB/InsP3R interaction is modulated and is established as an essential functional channel complex, regulation of InsP3-dependent Ca2+ release by CGB provides a new role for the chromogranins. Although the functional association between chromogranin and the InsP3R is shown here for the type I isoform, it is likely that similar interactions will also occur with the other InsP3R isoforms. The intraluminal loop of the InsP3R essential for chromogranin binding is conserved among the three InsP3R isoforms (34Mikoshiba K. TiPS. 1993; 14: 86-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and all of the InsP3R isoforms bind chromogranins (14Yoo S. Oh Y. Kang M. Huh Y. So S. Park H. Park H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45806-45812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to extending the association of chromogranin to all of the InsP3R isoforms, this relationship can also be generalized to a variety of other cell types. The CGB/InsP3R interaction has most often been associated with endocrine and neuroendocrine cells (35O'Conner D.T. Regul. Pept. 1983; 6: 263-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 36Fischer-Colbrie R. Lassmann H. Hagn C. Winkler H. Neuroscience. 1985; 16: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) as well as nonadrenergic neurons of the central nervous system (37Somogyi P. Hodgson A. DePotter R. Fischer-Colbrie R. Schober M. Winkler H. Chubb I. Brain Res. 1984; 320: 193-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Recently however, both the InsP3R and CGA were found to be selectively expressed in the apical region of ciliated oviductal cells (38Steffl M. Schweiger M. Amselgruber W. Ann. Anat. 2003; 185: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and have been suggested to play a role in controlling the ciliary activity of these cells. In addition to the potential role in ciliary function, it is very likely that the interaction between InsP3R and chromogranin will be the basis for numerous cellular processes, which depend on changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels. In neurons, both of the brain and periphery, a significant alteration in the CGB/InsP3R interaction will lead to dramatic changes not only in the initiation and propagation of Ca2+ signals but also in synaptic modulation, the regulation of gene expression, and the development of excitable cells (1Berridge M.J. Neuron. 1998; 21: 13-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1766) Google Scholar). Examples of altered CGB levels have been reported in tissue from patients with neurological diseases. Reduced levels of CGB were found in distinct subregions of the hippocampus from individuals with schizophrenia (39Nowakowski C. Kaufmann W. Adlassnig C. Maier H. Salimi K. Jellinger K. Marksteiner J. Schizophr. Res. 2002; 58: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In contrast, increased levels of CGB were found in the cerebrospinal fluid, Lewy bodies, and axonal swellings of patients with Parkinson's disease (25Yasuhara O. Kawamata T. Aimi Y. McGeer E.G. McGeer P.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1994; 170: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 40Eder U. Leitner B. Kirchmair R. Pohl P. Jobst K. Smith A. Mally J. Benzer A. Riederer P. Reichmann H. Saria A. Winkler H. J. Neural. Transm. 1998; 105: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 41Nishimura M. Tomimoto H. Suenaga T. Nakamura S. Namba Y. Ikeda K. Akiguchi I. Kimura J. Brain Res. 1994; 634: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). A combination of increased and decreased CGB expression levels was found throughout the hippocampus of individuals with Alzheimer's disease where a layer-specific distribution of CGB was present (30Marksteiner J. Kaufmann W.A. Gurka P. Humpel C. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2002; 18: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 42Marksteiner J. Lechner T. Kaufmann W. Gurka P. Humpel C. Nowakowski C. Maier H. Jellinger K. Acta Neuropathol. 2000; 100: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A potential mechanism for the pathophysiology of these neurological diseases is an altered neuronal Ca2+ signaling pattern. For example, the elevated CGB expression levels could result in increased InsP3-dependent Ca2+ release, which would account for subsequent cellular malfunctioning and apoptosis. In summary, this study demonstrates the shaping of cellular Ca2+ signaling by the interaction of a luminal Ca2+ storage protein with an intracellular Ca2+ release channel. The complex of these two proteins can now be considered to be major components of the basic functional channel unit, and the modulation of either component will shape InsP3-dependent Ca2+ release. The interactions described here also suggest a pathophysiological mechanism for neurological diseases. We thank Dr. R. Fischer-Colbrie for providing us with the cDNA for bovine CGB, Drs. Anton Bennett and Michael Nathanson for thoughtful discussions, and Dr. A. Varshney, G. Anyatonwu, S. N. Jacob, A. F. Bialek, and C. Schlecker for helpful comments on the paper. B.

In plants, Archaea, and most bacteria the common precursor of all tetrapyrroles, 5-aminolevulinic acid, is formed in a two-step reaction from the five-carbon chain of glutamate. Glutamyl-tRNA reductase (GluTR) catalyzes the NADPH-dependent reduction of glutamate to glutamate-1-semialdehyde (GSA), which is subsequently converted to 5-aminolevulinic acid by glutamate-1-semialdehyde-2,1-aminomutase (GSA-AM) (4Smith M.A. Kannangara C.G. Grimm B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11249-11254Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 5Ilag L.L. Jahn D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7143-7151Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To maintain the fidelity of protein biosynthesis and, at the same time, an adequate metabolite flux for 5-aminolevulinic acid formation, accurate recognition of various cellular tRNAs by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase and of Glu-tRNA by GluTR must be secured. The characteristic nucleotides in tRNAs (identity elements) needed for recognition by their cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have been characterized for many systems (6Ibba M. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 617-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). For the Escherichia coli GluRS·tRNAGlu system, 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiouridine in position 34, U35, C36, A37 in the anticodon loop, G1*C72, U2*A71 in the acceptor stem, the U11*A24 base pair, the U13*G22**A46 base triple, and the lack of residue 47 (Δ47) determine the charging identity (7Sekine S.-i.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the GluRS·tRNAGlu complex (9Sekine S.-i. Nureki O. Shimada A. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 189-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Sekine S.-i. Nureki O. Dubois D.Y. Bernier S. Chenevert R. Lapointe J. Vassylyev D.G. Yokoyama S. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 676-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) provided further insight to tRNAGlu recognition by GluRS. In contrast, there is little information on the recognition of Glu-tRNAGlu by GluTR. Specific sequence information is required, as 5-aminolevulinic acid synthesis in barley chloroplasts demands chloroplast tRNAGlu and not cytoplasmic tRNAGlu (11Peterson D. Schön A. Söll D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1988; 11: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Specificity of GluTR for tRNAGlu was also shown for the enzyme from Chlorella vulgaris (31Weinstein J.D. Mayer S.M. Beale S.I. Plant Physiol. 1986; 82: 1096-1101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Chlorobium vibrioforme (32Avissar Y.J. Beale S.I. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1656-1659Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (13Jahn D. O'Neill G.P. Verkamp E. Söll D. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 30: 245-253Google Scholar), and Synechocystis 6803 (12O'Neill G.P. Peterson D.M. Schön A. Chen M.W. Söll D. J Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3810-3816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on a sequence comparison of tRNAGlu species that are substrates for various GluTRs with tRNA species which are not utilized, putative identity elements were postulated (14Willows R. Kannangara C. Pontoppidan B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A point mutation (C56–U56) in Euglena gracilis chloroplast tRNAGlu was reported to uncouple protein and chlorophyll biosynthesis. This mutant tRNA was still aminoacylated by chloroplast GluRS and utilized in protein biosynthesis but was not a substrate for GluTR and therefore did not support tetrapyrrole biosynthesis (15Stange-Thomann N. Thomann H.U. Lloyd A.J. Lyman H. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7947-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The solution of the long sought-after crystal structure of GluTR (30Moser J. Schubert W.-D. Heinz D.W. Jahn D. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 579-584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the biochemical characterization of E. coli GluTR (16Schauer S. Chaturvedi S. Randau L. Moser J. Kitabatake M. Lorenz S. Verkamp E. Schubert W.-D. Nakayashiki T. Murai M. Wall K. Thomann H.-U. Heinz D.W. Inokuchi H. Söll D. Jahn D. J. Biol.

Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) generated much interest in the details of tRNA recognition by this protein. The role of the glutamate part of the substrate was elucidated by site-directed mutagenesis of the E. coli GluTR substrate binding pocket and the co-crystallization of glutamycin, a glutamate analogue, with the Methanopyrus kandleri enzyme (29Moser J. Schubert W.-D. Beier V. Bringemeier I. Jahn D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 23: 6583-6590Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Glutamycin was found tightly coordinated in the highly conserved catalytic pocket, which also includes the cysteine residue (Cys-50) known to form an intermediate thioester bond between the enzyme and glutamate (16Schauer S. Chaturvedi S. Randau L. Moser J. Kitabatake M. Lorenz S. Verkamp E. Schubert W.-D. Nakayashiki T. Murai M. Wall K. Thomann H.-U. Heinz D.W. Inokuchi H. Söll D. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48657-48663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, much less is known about the contribution of the tRNA portion of the substrate to recognition and catalysis. Here we present an analysis of tRNA identity in GluTR recognition. Production of Recombinant E. coli GluTR, GluRS, GSA-AM, and T7 RNAP—E. coli GluTR was produced as a six-histidine N-terminal fusion protein, renatured from inclusion bodies and purified as described (17Schauer S. Lüer C. Moser J. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 31: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Recombinant E. coli GluRS and GSA-AM were purified to apparent homogeneity according to published procedures (18Lin S. Brisson A. Liu J. Roy P.H. Lapointe J. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25Ilag L.L. Jahn D. Eggertsson G. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3408-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bacteriophage T7 RNAP was purified from an overproducing E. coli strain harboring the plasmid pAR1219 as outlined previously (19Davanloo P. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2035-2039Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). Construction of Expression Vectors for tRNAGlu Variants—The majority of expression vectors for the production of E. coli tRNAGlu variants were described before (7Sekine S.-i. Nureki O. Sakamoto K. Tatsuya N. Tateno M. Go M. Kohno T. Brisson A. Lapointe J. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The plasmid pKR320 (20Rogers K.C. Söll D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14210-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) contains the E. coli tRNAGlu gene cloned downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The tRNAGlu variants encoding tRNAs harboring the point mutations C56U, G19A, C56U/G19A, U8C, C56G, minimalist tDNA constructs ΔAC1 and ΔAC2, and the minihelix (see Fig. 1) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the plasmid pKR320 using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). To obtain the minimalist tDNA constructs an expression vector encoding a tRNAGlu transcript that lacks the entire anticodon stem/loop (pKR320ΔAC) was generated by deletion of 22 nucleotides using the oligonucleotide 5′-CTAGAGGCCCAGGACAGGGGTTCGAATCC-3′. The following oligonucleotides were employed to insert the linker region in plasmid pKR320ΔAC underlined, 5′-CTAGAGGCCCAGGACAAATATAACAGGGGTTCGAATCC-3′ (ΔAC1) and 5′-CTAGAGGCCCAGGACAATTAACAGGGGTTCGAATCC-3′ (ΔAC2). The minihelix was constructed by the deletion of 19 nucleotides of plasmid pKR-320ΔAC using the oligonucleotide 5′-CACTATAGTCCCCTAGGGGTTCGAATC-3′. All introduced mutations were verified by complete DNA sequence determination. Preparation and Purification of tRNA Gene Transcripts—E. coli tRNAGlu (UUC) variants and minimalist tRNAGlu molecules were synthesized by in vitro T7 RNAP run-off transcription (21Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The DNA fragments carrying the E. coli tRNAGlu gene variants including the T7 RNAP promoter were amplified using PCR. To generate the appropriate 3′-CCA-end of the tRNAGlu transcripts, the various PCR-amplified template DNAs carrying the tRNAGlu genes were digested with NspI and with FokI in the case of the minimalist tRNA molecules. The in vitro transcription reaction was performed at 37 °C for 3 h in a buffer containing 40 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.1, 10 mm MgCl2,40 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm spermidine, 200 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2.0–5.0 mm each nucleoside triphosphate (depending on the template), the PCR-amplified template DNA (∼0.5 μm), and 100 μg/ml (1 mm) T7 RNAP. The E. coli tRNAGln (CUG) transcript was prepared according to published procedures (22Jahn M. Rogers M.J. Söll D. Nature. 1991; 352: 258-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The RNA transcripts were subsequently purified by MonoQ anion exchange chromatography as described (23Jahn M.J. Jahn D. Kumar A.M. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2786Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation of tRNAGlu—The GluTR substrate [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu was prepared in 100 or 500 μl aminoacylation reaction mixtures containing 30 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 25 mm KCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm ATP, and 40 μm [14C]glutamate (10 μCi) with a specific activity of 284 mCi/mmol (10.5 GBq/mmol). The tRNA transcript concentrations ranged from 1 to 20 μm and GluRS concentrations varied from 400 nm to 8 μm depending on the specific tRNA variant. Minimalist tRNA substrates were denatured at 90 °C for 3 min and quickly cooled on ice to facilitate RNA folding. GluTR Assay—As GSA, the product of GluTR catalysis, is highly unstable under physiological conditions and difficult to isolate in reproducible quantities, GluTR activity was measured by the substrate depletion assay, which is currently the most reliable method of analysis (24Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This assay determines the decrease of [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu substrate during GluTR catalysis and identifies the formed GSA product via high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis. The GluTR assay mix (100 μl) contained 50 nm purified recombinant E. coli GluTR in 30 mm Na-HEPES, pH 8.1, 10 mm MgCl2, 15 mm KCl, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin, 2 mm NADPH, and ∼2 μm [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu. Duplicate reactions were performed using 100 and 200 nm final GluTR concentrations. The reactions were started by the addition of [14C]Glu-tRNAGlu, incubated at 37 °C, and stopped by pipetting aliquots of 20 μl from the assay mixture onto Whatman 3MM filters at fixed time points of 15-, 30-, 45-, 60-, and 180-s reaction times. The tRNA was precipitated, washed, and quantified as described previously (27Hoben P. Söll D. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 113: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Reaction assays without GluTR for each employed condition served as background controls for spontaneous substrate hydrolysis (∼5% after a 3-min reaction time). As some of the mutations in tRNAGlu also affected glutamylation, the amounts of the GluTR substrate, Glu-tRNAGlu, were limited and did not permit use of the appropriate excess of substrate required for classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Therefore, GluTR specific activity was deduced from first-order equation by a method described previously (44Chapman K.T. Kopka I.E. Durette P.L. Esser C.K. Lanza T.J. Izquierdo-Martin M. Niedzwiecki L. Chang B. Harrison R.K. Kuo D.W. Lin T.-Y. Stein R.L. Hagmann W.K. J. Med. Chem. 1993; 36: 4293-4301Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). HPLC Analysis of GluTR Product Formation—Reaction products were analyzed on a Waters Bondapack™ C18 reversed phase column (3.9 × 150 mm, 125-Å pore size, 10-μm particle diameter) as described previously (24Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction product GSA was identified by its specific conversion into 5-aminolevulinic acid using purified E. coli GSA-AM (25Ilag L.L. Jahn D. Eggertsson G. Söll D. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 3408-3413Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). tRNA Footprinting Using RNase Digestion—The E. coli tRNAGlu transcript was 3′-end-labeled using published procedures (26Frugier M. Moulinier L. Giegé R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and charged with glutamate as described above. RNase footprintings were performed according to the manufacturer's instruction using RNase V1, RNase T1, and Nuclease S1 purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Prior to the reaction 2–3 μg of end-labeled Glu-tRNAGlu, 0.1–10 μm GluTR, and 10 mm of the GluTR inhibitor β-nicotinamide-mononucleotide (reduced form) (Sigma) were incubated at 4 °C for 3 min to allow the formation of the GluTR·tRNA complex. Control experiments omitted either RNase or GluTR. The cleavage pattern of the footprinting reactions was analyzed by electrophoresis on denaturing 15% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were exposed to a Fuji Bas-III imaging screen for 16 h at -80 °C. Circular Dichroism (CD) and UV Absorption Measurements—CD and UV molecular absorption spectra (195–320 nm) were recorded on a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter equipped with Neslab RET-110 temperature control unit. Each tRNA sample (∼0.3 mg/ml) was initially stabilized at 27 °C for 15 min. Melting experiments were performed at 1 °C increments using a temperature rate of 30 °C/h in the presence of either 10 mm EDTA or 10 mm MgCl2. Because both GluTR and GluRS recognize the same tRNAGlu, we wanted to compare which nucleotides are crucial for recognition. The earlier studies on GluRS identity not only presented a basis for comparison but also provided the large set of in vitro synthesized Glu-tRNAGlu variants required to identify residues in E. coli tRNAGlu that are important for E. coli GluTR activity. Kinetic Analysis of tRNAGlu Variants—The recognition of Glu-tRNAGlu by GluTR was examined by the kinetic analysis of unmodified wild type tRNAGlu (Fig. 1) and 51 tRNAGlu variants that were prepared by in vitro run-off transcription. All transcripts were aminoacylated with [14C]glutamate using E. coli GluRS and tested as GluTR substrates in the depletion assay by monitoring the loss of charged tRNAGlu (24Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The formation of the reaction product GSA was verified by HPLC analysis. It was shown previously that E. coli GluTR utilizes fully modified E. coli Glu-tRNAGlu and unmodified Glu-tRNAGlu transcripts at comparable catalytic rates (16Schauer S. Chaturvedi S. Randau L. Moser J. Kitabatake M. Lorenz S. Verkamp E. Schubert W.-D. Nakayashiki T. Murai M. Wall K. Thomann H.-U. Heinz D.W. Inokuchi H. Söll D. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48657-48663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The specific activity for this process was measured as 0.47 μmol min-1 mg-1 (kcat = 0.38 s-1) and was set to 100%. All other values obtained in this study were related to this value. The majority of charged tRNAGlu transcripts harboring single, double, or triple mutations were utilized by E. coli GluTR without any significant reduction of the catalytic activity (Table I). Interestingly, this set also includes tRNAGlu transcripts carrying the mutations of bases that are known to be identity elements in tRNAGlu for recognition by E. coli GluRS (7Sekine S.-i. Nureki O. Sakamoto K. Tatsuya N. Tateno M. Go M. Kohno T. Brisson A. Lapointe J. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 8Sekine S.-i. Nureki O. Tateno M.

This contrasts with observations made with GluRS, which is known to recognize the residues U34, U35, C36, and A37 of the anticodon loop. In agreement with this, the loss of the 5-methylaminomethyl-2-thiol (mnm5s2) modification of the base U34 in the tRNAGlu transcript, which significantly contributes to tRNAGlu identity for GluRS (33Sylvers L.A. Rogers K.C. Shimizu M. Ohtsuka E. Söll D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3836-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), does not affect GluTR activity (16Schauer S. Chaturvedi S. Randau L. Moser J. Kitabatake M. Lorenz S. Verkamp E. Schubert W.-D. Nakayashiki T. Murai M. Wall K. Thomann H.-U. Heinz D.W. Inokuchi H. Söll D. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48657-48663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no tRNAGlu identity elements for GluTR were found in the acceptor stem. The discriminator base G73 and all base pairs of the acceptor stem (G1*C72, U2*A71, C3*G70, C4*G69, C5*G68, C6*G67, U7*A66) were mutated without affecting GluTR activity. In contrast, GluRS was shown to recognize G1*C72 and U2*A71 (7Sekine S.-i. Nureki O. Sakamoto K. Tatsuya N. Tateno M. Go M. Kohno T. Brisson A. Lapointe J. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The Unique Tertiary Core Structure of tRNAGlu Is Recognized by GluTR—The tRNAGlu variants that led to significantly reduced GluTR activity are summarized in Table II. A set of tRNAGlu variants harboring mutations in the tertiary core (D-stem/loop, variable loop, and T-stem/loop) was synthesized by T7 RNAP transcription. The U13*G22**A46 base triple is formed via a tertiary base pairing between the phylogenetically conserved pyrimidine 13-purine 22 motif (U13*G22 in tRNA-Glu) in the D-stem and base 46 (A46) in the variable loop (36Ladner J.E. Jack A. Robertus J.D. Brown R.S. Rhodes D. Clark B.F. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4414-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 2C). A tRNAGlu transcript carrying a mutation of U13–C13, which allows the formation of the Watson-Crick base pair C13*G22, was still a reasonable substrate for GluTR but led to significantly reduced GluRS activity (7Sekine S.-i. Nureki O. Sakamoto K. Tatsuya N. Tateno M. Go M. Kohno T. Brisson A. Lapointe J. Yokoyama S. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 685-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, for both GluRS and GluTR mutations of the bases G22 and A46 (to A22, G46, U46) almost abolished substrate utilization. Furthermore the tertiary core of tRNAGlu is characterized by the lack of residue 47 in the four nucleotide short variable loop. The insertion of U into position 47 decreased the catalytic activity of GluTR as well as of GluRS. As the base triple 13*22**46 was shown to play an important role in maintaining the overall folding of the tRNA (34Behlen L.S. Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), it seems likely that GluTR recognition strongly depends on the unique core structure of tRNAGlu. In addition, the lack of residue 47 is thought to stabilize the mentioned base triple via stable positioning of base A46 (35Westhof E. Dumas P. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 119-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Furthermore the strictly conserved tertiary base pair U8*A14, which forms a reverse Hoogsteen pairing configuration, was disrupted in a tRNAGlu variant, which harbored a mutation of the base U8–C8. The transcript, although charged by GluRS, was only a weak substrate for GluTR (Table II). The finding that the tertiary core structure of tRNAGlu is recognized by GluTR was supported by in vivo data from E. gracilis. It was shown that a point mutation of tRNAGlu led to a chlorophyll-deficient phenotype, with a tRNAGlu variant still participating in chloroplast protein biosynthesis but no longer able to be utilized by GluTR (15Stange-Thomann N. Thomann H.U. Lloyd A.J. Lyman H. Söll D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7947-7951Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The E. gracilis tRNAGlu harbored the single mutation of C56–U56. As this base forms a tertiary Watson-Crick base pair with the base G19 it was interesting to test the consequences of this mutation in the E. coli system. We verified that the E. coli tRNAGlu variant transcript carrying a mutation of the base C56–U56 was efficiently aminoacylated by E. coli GluRS. However, it was a poor substrate for E. coli GluTR. A single mutation of base G19–U19 also prevented utilization by GluTR. Interestingly, the double mutant restoring this tertiary base pair (A19**U56–G19**C56) led to nearly full GluTR utilization. Thus the base exchanges C56–U56 and G19–U19 destroy another important feature of the tertiary core of tRNAGlu, the G19**C56 base pair (Fig. 2).

The stabilities of wild type tRNAGlu transcripts and the variants affecting tertiary base interactions were investigated by thermal unfolding experiments. The changing spectroscopic features of various tRNAGlu transcripts were investigated by UV absorbance and CD spectroscopy and compared. The increasing UV absorbance during the thermal tRNA unfolding process was monitored between 250 and 270 nm. This region of the tRNA spectrum showed the highest degree of absorbance and hyperchromicity (data not shown). However, the UV absorbance spectra of the various tRNAGlu molecules changed only slightly during the thermal unfolding process. In contrast, clear changes of the corresponding CD spectra between 80 and 320 nm were observed. The CD spectrum of folded wild type tRNAGlu at 27 °C showed a minimum centered at 210 nm and a maximum centered at 270 nm. During the melting process of this tRNAGlu molecule the absorbance at 210 nm increased with the rising temperature, whereas the absorbance at 270 nm maximum decreased in amplitude and shifted its maximum to 277 nm (Fig. 3A). Fig. 3B shows a differential representation of the melting curves based on changes in the ellipticity at the single wavelength at 210 nm for the wild type tRNAGlu transcript. In the same figure the corresponding data for the tRNAGlu variant transcript harboring the base exchange C56–U56 is shown. Only minimal differences (<1 °C) of the melting point between wild type tRNAGlu transcript and the U56 variants were noticed, indicating an almost identical stability of these transcripts. Similar to identical results were obtained during the analysis of the tertiary core mutants G56, G56, A19, and A19**U56. In agreement with these observations, the melting temperature for wild type tRNAGlu transcript and all investigated variants was shifted from 33 °C in the presence of 10 mm EDTA to 56 °C in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. In conclusion, the performed melting experiments indicate no altered conformational stability for any investigated variants. We conclude that mutations in the tertiary base pair C56*G19 cause only minor alterations in structure and stability. Nevertheless, this part of the tRNAGlu molecule represents the central recognition element for GluTR. Minimization of the RNA Substrate—To further narrow down the influence of the tRNA tertiary core on overall tRNAGlu recognition by GluTR, minimalist tRNAGlu substrates were designed (Fig. 1). For the truncated construct ΔAC1 the anti-codon stem/loop region was deleted and replaced by a linker region of the two nucleotides AU. For the molecule ΔAC2 the linker consists of four nucleotides (AAUA). These linker regions were designed to allow the necessary base interactions of the tertiary core. Aminoacylation of these truncated transcripts by GluRS to wild type level was achieved by increasing the RNA and GluRS concentration up to 3 and 10 μm, respectively. Both constructs ΔAC1 and ΔAC2 served as efficient substrates in the standard GluTR depletion assay (Table II). We concluded from these results that the whole anticodon stem/loop region is not needed for the recognition of Glu-tRNAGlu by GluTR. To examine the effect of further reduction of the tRNA substrate, a minihelix comprising the acceptor stem, the T-stem, and T-loop was constructed. This minihelix is missing the tertiary core of tRNAGlu. The minihelix transcript was charged with glutamate in an aminoacylation reaction containing 16 μm GluRS for 1.5 h. This glutamyl-minihelix was not a substrate for GluTR in the standard GluTR depletion assay (Table II). In conclusion, these experiments provided further evidence for the role of the tertiary core of tRNAGlu in GluTR recognition. RNase Footprinting Reveals Glu-tRNAGlu·GluTR Interactions at the Tertiary Core—RNase footprinting was employed to investigate GluTR·Glu-tRNAGlu interactions. Initial experiments were hampered by substrate destruction caused by GluTR. In the absence of NADPH GluTR possesses an esterase activity that hydrolyzes the Glu-tRNAGlu substrate into tRNAGlu and glutamate. To stabilize the GluTR-bound substrate GluTR esterase activity was inhibited by the NADPH analogue β-nicotinamide-mononucleotide (reduced form) as described before (24Moser J. Lorenz S. Hubschwerlen C. Rompf A. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30679-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We used RNases V1, T1, and nuclease S1 to digest Glu-tRNAGlu alone and in complex with GluTR to investigate changes in the protection pattern. During the precharging reaction nonspecific cleavage of the transcript at certain weak points was inevitable and might be induced by GluRS (28Beresten S. Jahn M. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These positions were omitted from further analysis. Surprisingly, the addition of up to 100 nm GluTR reproducibly led to increased RNase V1 digestion at the T-stem, D-stem, and parts of the anticodon stem. These findings might indicate conformational changes of the tRNA structure induced by docking to GluTR or alternatively the occurrence of GluTR RNase V1 protein-protein interactions. Thus, changes in the protection pattern of tRNAGlu were only observed by RNase T1 and nuclease S1 treatment. Protection of the base G10 in the D-stem and the bases G53, U54, and U55 in the T-loop from RNase digestion by GluTR was observed (Fig. 4A). The protection of these positions was verified by digestion of phosphorothioate containing tRNA transcripts (data not shown). Therefore, the direct interaction of GluTR with the tertiary core of tRNAGlu was demonstrated. In the current model of Glu-tRNAGlu·GluTR interactions (29Moser J. Schubert W.-D. Beier V. Bringemeier I. Jahn D. Heinz D.W. EMBO J. 2001; 23: 6583-6590Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar), based on the position of glutamycin, which mimics the 3′-end of Glu-tRNAGlu in the active site pocket, the tRNAGlu is bound from the inside of the L-shape of the molecule, similar to its binding to GluRS. It is in precisely this region of the tRNA that the protected bases are localized (Fig. 4). The Glu-tRNAGlu·GluTR model is based on the M. kandleri GluTR structure, which reveals significant catalytic and structural similarities to the E. coli enzyme (16Schauer S. Chaturvedi S. Randau L. Moser J. Kitabatake M. Lorenz S. Verkamp E. Schubert W.-D. Nakayashiki T. Murai M. Wall K. Thomann H.-U. Heinz D.W. Inokuchi H. Söll D. Jahn D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48657-48663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) so that an analogue tRNA orientation is proposed. GluTR Shows tRNAGlu Specificity—Finally, we investigated whether the unique tertiary core of tRNAGlu provides enough information to discriminate against the closely related tRNAGln when mischarged with glutamate. The tRNAGln transcript of E. coli was mischarged with glutamate using 31 μm GlnRS and 80 μm glutamate and tested for GluTR acceptance in standard depletion assays. However, [14C]Glu-tRNAGln was not a substrate for GluTR. Because many organisms carrying GluTR form glutaminyl-tRNA via naturally mischarged Glu-tRNAGln (20Rogers K.C. Söll D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14210-14219Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) this observation is of biological significance. General Discussion—GluTR is an enzyme that uses aminoacyl-tRNA as substrate. Specific recognition of Glu-tRNA by E. coli GluTR is brought about by the unique tertiary core of tRNAGlu created by the U13*G22**A46 base triple, Δ47, and the tertiary base pair G19*C56. Neither the anticodon nor acceptor stem are major identity elements, as they are for most aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The accuracy of this process is further sustained by the tight coordination of the glutamate part of the substrate in the active site pocket of GluTR. Do other enzymes that utilize aminoacyl-tRNA as a substrate recognize tRNA in a similar fashion? For instance, E. coli methionyl-tRNAfMet formyltransferase, the enzyme required for formylating the initiator tRNA, requires a cluster of determinants in the acceptor stem and the A11*U24 base pair in the D-stem (37Lee C.P. Seong B.L. RajBhandary U.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18012-18017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Guillon J.M. Meinnel T. Mechulam Y. Lazennec C. Blanquet S. Fayat G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Furthermore, similar to GluTR, increased RNase V1 digestion was observed in the anticodon stem, although this region is located distal to the tRNA-protein contacts observed in the co-crystal structure (39Schmitt E. Panvert M. Blanquet S. Mechulam Y. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6819-6826Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This observation was explained by conformational changes of the tRNA structure induced by Met-tRNA formyltransferase binding (40Mayer C. RajBhandary U.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2844-2850Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, enhanced RNase V1 cleavage in the anticodon stem was also described for the EF-Tu·Phe-tRNAPhe·GTP and IF2·fMet-tRNA complexes suggesting changes in anticodon stem conformation even though these proteins interact with the distal acceptor stem (41Nissen P.

Grunberg-Manago M. Ebel J.P. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to explore conformational changes in Glu-tRNAGlu structure possibly induced by GluTR binding. Finally, selenocysteyl-tRNASec is an aminoacyl-tRNA substrate specifically recognized by selenocysteine synthase and the SELB translation factor. The unusually long eight-base-pair acceptor stem of E. coli tRNASec was found to be the major recognition determinant for SELB (43Baron C. Böck A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20375-20379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanisms of further enzymes utilizing an aminoacyl-tRNA substrate, e.g. Glu-tRNAGln amidotransferase, which transamidates misacylated Glu-tRNAGln, are still under investigation. These results suggest that enzymes utilizing aminoacyl-tRNA as substrate interact directly with the aminoacylated acceptor stem and the D-stem, whereas the anticodon domain serves as a major recognition element of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases.

Because this is the first peptide ligand for these receptors, we compared its interactions with the three recombinant human α1-AR subtypes (α1A, α1B, and α1D). Radioligand binding assays showed that ρ-TIA was 10-fold selective for human α1B-over α1A- and α1D-ARs. As observed with hamster α1B-ARs, ρ-TIA decreased the number of binding sites (Bmax) for human α1B-ARs without changing affinity (KD), and this inhibition was unaffected by the length of incubation but was reversed by washing. However, ρ-TIA had opposite effects at human α1A-ARs and α1D-ARs, decreasing KD without changing Bmax, suggesting it acts competitively at these subtypes. ρ-TIA reduced maximal NE-stimulated [3H]inositol phosphate formation in HEK293 cells expressing human α1B-ARs but competitively inhibited responses in cells expressing α1A- or α1D-ARs. Truncation mutants showed that the amino-terminal domains of α1B- or α1D-ARs are not involved in interaction with ρ-TIA. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of ρ-TIA showed F18A had an increased selectivity for α1B-ARs, and F18N also increased subtype selectivity. I8A had a slightly reduced potency at α1B-ARs and was found to be a competitive, rather than noncompetitive, inhibitor in both radioligand and functional assays. Thus ρ-TIA noncompetitively inhibits α1B-ARs but competitively inhibits the other two subtypes, and this selectivity can be increased by mutation. These differential interactions do not involve the receptor amino termini and are not because of the charged nature of the peptide, and isoleucine 8 is critical for its noncompetitive inhibition at α1B-ARs.

Studies on recombinant hamster α1B-ARs found that increasing concentrations of ρ-TIA progressively reduced the density of radioligand binding sites without changing radioligand affinity, suggesting that ρ-TIA is a noncompetitive, possibly allosteric, inhibitor of α1B-ARs. In addition, radioligand binding assays performed using recombinant rodent α1-AR subtypes revealed a 2–5-fold higher affinity for ρ-TIA at α1B-ARs (27Sharpe I.A. Thomas L. Loughnan M. Motin L.

Allosteric modulators of GPCRs have received increasing attention over the last few years for their potential specificity and lack of undesirable effects (28Christopoulos A. Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 323-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Unlike drugs that act on the conserved orthosteric binding sites of closely related receptor subtypes, actions of allosteric modulators have been found to be highly specific for particular receptor subtypes, because they often interact with less highly conserved sites (28Christopoulos A. Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 323-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Although ρ-TIA also inhibits rodent α1A- and α1D-ARs, its mode of inhibition has not yet been determined. In addition, its effects on human subtypes are still unknown. In this study, we compared the effects of ρ-TIA at all three human α1-AR subtypes stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We found that ρ-TIA acts noncompetitively at human α1B-ARs but competitively at α1A- and α1D-ARs and that the isoleucine at position 8 in ρ-TIA is required for noncompetitive inhibition. In addition, ρ-TIA is the first highly selective antagonist for human α1B-ARs, which will be useful in functional characterization of this receptor. Materials—Materials were obtained from the following sources: HEK293 cells, American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA); penicillin, streptomycin, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), (–)-norepinephrine (NE) bitartrate, phentolamine mesylate, Sigma; carrier-free Na[125I], Amersham Biosciences; myo-[3H]inositol (1 mCi/ml), American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO); Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose and l-glutamine, Mediatech (Herndon, VA); {[2-β-(4-hydroxyphenyl)ethylaminomethyl]tetralone} from Dr. Giuseppe Romeo (University of Catania, Italy); [3H]prazosin, PerkinElmer Life Sciences; Fmoc-Rink amide resin (Polymer labs, 0.73 mmol/g, Scientex Australia); Fmoc amino acids (Novabiochem). Peptide Synthesis—ρ-TIA and its analogs were assembled using Fmoc chemistry. Chain assembly of the peptides was performed on a manual shaker system using HBTU activation protocols (29Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) or on an ACT396 synthesizer using HBTU in situ activation protocols. The Fmoc protecting group was removed using 50% piperidine in dimethylformamide, and dimethylformamide was used as both the coupling solvent and for flow washes throughout the cycle. Where possible, the progress of the assembly was monitored by quantitative ninhydrin monitoring (30Sarin V.K. Kent S.B. Tam J.P. Merrifield R.B. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 117: 147-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar). Peptide was deprotected and cleaved from the resin by stirring at room temperature in trifluoroacetic acid:H2O:triisopropyl silane: ethanedithiol (90:5:2.5:2.5) for 2–3 h. Cold diethyl ether was then added to the filtered mixture, and the precipitated peptide was collected by centrifugation. The final product was dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and lyophilized to yield a white solid. The crude, reduced peptide was examined by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography for purity, and the correct molecular weight was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. Pure, reduced peptide was oxidized using 30% isopropyl alcohol, 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.7, for 24 h, and then the major peak was purified to >95% purity and characterized by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry prior to further use.

Chem. 2003; 46: 2877-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% calf serum, 4.5g/liter glucose, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 105 units/liter penicillin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Confluent 150-mm plates were subcultured at a ratio of 1:4 or 1:6 for transfection and cultured for 24–48 h. For cells expressing N-truncated constructs (see below), HEK293 cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA of each construct for 3 h using Superfect® transfection reagent and were used for experimentation 48–72 h after transfection. Membrane Preparation—Confluent 150-mm plates were washed with PBS (10 mm phosphate buffer, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) and harvested by scraping. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in PBS, and homogenized with a Polytron. This process was then repeated, and final membranes were collected in 0.5 ml of PBS. Radioligand Binding—Receptor density was determined by saturation binding assays with the α1-AR-specific antagonist 125 I-BE (20–800 pm) (33Minneman K.P. Fox A.W. Abel P.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 23: 359-368PubMed Google Scholar) or [3H]prazosin (200–5000 pm) (34Greengrass P. Bremner R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1979; 55: 323-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with the indicated concentrations of either 125I-BE or [3H]prazosin at 37 °C in a water bath for 20 min. After incubation, samples were filtered through a wet Whatman GF/B paper under vacuum. Filter papers were washed twice with cold wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4), and radioactivity was measured by gamma counting. Nonspecific binding was determined as binding in the presence of 10 μm phentolamine. For the washout experiments, membranes were aliquoted into two sets and incubated with or without 30 nm ρ-TIA. For each wash, each sample was diluted 2.5-fold with PBS, homogenized, and resuspended in the appropriate volume of PBS. 125I-BE was added with or without phentolamine; samples were incubated at 37 °C and filtered, and radioactivity was measured by gamma counting. The amount of specific binding inhibited by 30 nm ρ-TIA was calculated after each wash. Nonspecific binding was defined as binding remaining in the presence of 10 μm phentolamine. [3H]InsP Formation—Accumulation of [3H]inositol phosphates (InsPs) was determined in confluent 96-well plates as described previously (35Theroux T.L. Esbenshade T.A. Peavy R.D. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1376-1387PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with [3H]inositol (1 μCi/well) at the time of seeding and grown for 1–2 days until confluent. On the day of the experiments, wells were washed carefully with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) buffer (120 mm NaCl, 5.5 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm NaH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 20 mm NaHCO3, 11 mm glucose, 0.029 mm Na2EDTA) containing 10 mm LiCl, and then incubated with 0.1 ml of Li-KRB containing drugs at the indicated concentrations. Conopeptides were prepared in 50 μl of Li-KRB and added into the wells before adding an equal volume of Li-KRB containing appropriate NE concentrations. After incubating at 37 °C (in 95%O2/5%CO2) for 1 h, reactions were stopped by adding 10 mm formic acid. Samples were sonicated for 10 s, and [3H]InsPs were isolated by anion exchange chromatography as described (35Theroux T.L. Esbenshade T.A. Peavy R.D. Minneman K.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1376-1387PubMed Google Scholar). Data were normalized to % maximal stimulation caused by 100 μm NE alone. NE caused no stimulation of [3H]InsP formation in nontransfected HEK293 cells at concentrations up to 300 μm. Schild plot was generated as described previously (36Arunlakshana O. Schild H.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1959; 14: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4275) Google Scholar). Generation of Amino-terminal Truncated Receptors—Amino-terminally truncated human α1D-ARs (Δ1–79) were constructed in pRSVICAT vectors as described previously (37Hague C. Chen Z. Pupo A.S. Schulte N. Toews M.L. Minneman K.P. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Amino-terminally truncated human α1B-ARs (Δ1–38) were generated by PCR using specific primers on human α1B-AR cDNA in pDT, subcloned, and sequenced. Data Analysis—Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of results obtained from the indicated number of observations. For radioligand binding, calculations of KD and Bmax for saturation analysis, and IC50 values for inhibition of specific binding by peptides were fit by nonlinear regression using Prism (GraphPad). Global fitting was used to define the mode of inhibition of ρ-TIA from saturation analysis (either shared KD or shared Bmax). Concentration-response curves for stimulation of [3H]InsP formation were also analyzed by nonlinear regression. One-way analysis of variance with post hoc t test performed by the Tukey method was used where indicated. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. ρ-TIA Inhibition of Specific 125I-BE Binding in HEK293 Cell Membranes Expressing Human α1A-, α1B-, or α1D-ARs—Because ρ-TIA showed noncompetitive inhibition at hamster α1B-ARs (26Sharpe I.A. Gehrmann J. Loughnan M.L. Thomas L. Adams D.A. Atkins A. Palant E. Craik D.J. Adams D.J. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we investigated the inhibitory effects of ρ-TIA at human α1A-, α1B-, and α1D-ARs. Increasing concentrations of ρ-TIA inhibited specific 125I-BE binding to membranes prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing individual α1-AR subtypes (Fig. 1). However, unlike the limited selectivity observed previously with the rodent clones (27Sharpe I.A. Thomas L. Loughnan M. Motin L. Palant E. Croker D.E. Alewood D. Chen S. Graham R.M. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34451-34457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), ρ-TIA was more potent and showed a 10-fold α1B selectivity. IC50 values for ρ-TIA were 18 nm (logIC50 –7.4 ± 0.08) at α1A-ARs; 2 nm (logIC50 –8.4 ± 0.10) at α1B-ARs; and 25 nm (logIC50 –7.3 ± 0.13) at α1D-ARs. The difference in potency of ρ-TIA was significant between α1B-ARs and α1A- and α1D-ARs (p < 0.001) but not between α1A-ARs and α1D-ARs. Mode of Inhibition—To determine whether ρ-TIA acts noncompetitively at each human α1-AR subtype, saturation binding assays with the selective antagonist 125I-BE were performed on membranes prepared from HEK293 cells expressing individual α1-AR subtypes in the presence or absence of 100 nm ρ-TIA (Fig. 2). Nonlinear regression analysis was used to determine whether inhibition by ρ-TIA was competitive (shared Bmax) or noncompetitive (shared KD). It was found that inhibition of specific 125I-BE binding to human α1B-ARs was clearly noncompetitive (p < 0.005), whereas inhibition of binding to human α1A- and α1D-ARs was competitive (p < 0.01 for α1A- and p < 0.05 for α1D-ARs). To confirm that these findings could be generalized to another α1-AR radioligand, the same experiments were repeated using [3H]prazosin in place of 125I-BE. In agreement with our previous experiments, ρ-TIA noncompetitively inhibited α1B-AR binding (p < 0.005) but was competitive at the α1A-AR (p < 0.05) and α1D-AR (p < 0.01) subtypes (data not shown). Therefore, these observations suggest ρ-TIA acts differently at the α1-AR subtypes as a noncompetitive inhibitor at human α1B-ARs but as a competitive inhibitor at α1A- and α1D-ARs. ρ-TIA Binds to the Human α1B-AR in a Reversible Manner— Although previous experiments suggested that ρ-TIA binds to human α1B-ARs noncompetitively, it is unclear if this binding is also reversible. To examine this, HEK293 cells stably expressing human α1B-ARs were preincubated with increasing concentrations of ρ-TIA for 2 h. As shown in Fig. 3A, preincubation had no effect on ρ-TIA potency for inhibiting 125I-BE binding, demonstrating that ρ-TIA acts in a time-independent manner. In addition, repeated washes slowly reversed ρ-TIA inhibition of 125I-BE binding, supporting the reversibility of this interaction (Fig. 3B). Thus, these data indicate ρ-TIA binds in a noncompetitive, reversible manner to the human α1B-AR, which suggests that ρ-TIA is likely to be an allosteric inhibitor. ρ-TIA Inhibition of NE-stimulated [3H]InsP Formation—Radioligand binding studies suggested that ρ-TIA binds differentially to the human α1-AR subtypes, and we wanted to determine whether similar results could be obtained with functional responses. To address this question, the ability of ρ-TIA in inhibiting NE-stimulated [3H]InsP formation in HEK293 cells stably expressing individual α1-AR subtypes was examined. Cells were preincubated with [3H]inositol and stimulated with increasing concentrations of NE for 1 h in the absence or presence of various concentrations of ρ-TIA. As shown in Fig. 4, increasing concentrations of ρ-TIA caused parallel rightward shifts in the NE concentration-response curve for α1A- and α1D-ARs, without causing significant decreases in the NE maximal responses. From the concentration-response curves, Schild plots were constructed, and ρ-TIA pA2 values were calculated as –7.0 for α1A-ARs and –6.8 for α1D-ARs, which were similar to the KD values generated from radioligand binding studies. Slope values were not significantly different from unity at either subtype, suggesting that ρ-TIA binds to a single population of binding sites. In direct contrast, increasing concentrations of ρ-TIA caused sequential decreases in the NE maximal response to α1B-AR activation, indicative of noncompetitive inhibition. These findings further support the hypothesis that ρ-TIA acts as a noncompetitive inhibitor at human α1B-ARs but competitively inhibits human α1A- and α1D-ARs. Role of the α1-AR Amino Terminus in ρ-TIA Binding—Previous studies (38Xie Y.B. Wang H. Segaloff D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21411-21414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the amino-terminal regions of GPCRs are involved in the formation of the binding pocket for peptide ligands. The amino-terminal regions of α1-AR subtypes differ in size and display very little sequence homology (37Hague C. Chen Z. Pupo A.S. Schulte N. Toews M.L. Minneman K.P. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 2004; 309: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 39Pupo A.S. Uberti M.A. Minneman K.P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 462: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether these domains are important for ρ-TIA binding, we compared the potency of ρ-TIA in inhibiting specific 125I-BE binding to both amino-terminal truncated and full-length α1B- and α1D-ARs. As shown in Fig. 5, ρ-TIA inhibited specific 125I-BE binding to full-length and amino-terminally truncated α1B- and α1D-ARs with similar potency, suggesting that the amino-terminal domains of these α1-AR subtypes are not important for ρ-TIA binding. We did not perform experiments using truncated α1A-ARs, as the α1A-AR has a very short amino terminus (25 amino acids) relative to the α1B-(45 amino acids) and α1D-AR (95 amino acids) subtypes and is unlikely to be involved in ρ-TIA binding given that the amino-terminal regions of α1B- and α1D-ARs were not involved. Effect of Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis on Selectivity of ρ-TIA for α1-AR Subtypes—To examine the importance of individual amino acids in conferring α1-AR subtype selectivity, ρ-TIA was subjected to alanine scanning mutagenesis of non-cysteine residues. ρ-TIA and alanine-substituted analog potencies for inhibiting 125I-BE binding at α1-AR subtypes are displayed in Fig. 6. The majority of the peptide analogs examined retained their α1B-AR selectivity, although it was somewhat lower than that of the parent compound. In a few instances, there was a loss of α1B-AR selectivity (R4A and I8A). A number of analogs (F1A, L7A, and R12A) bound with lower affinity to α1B-ARs than ρ-TIA but had a higher degree of selectivity between the α1B-ARs and α1A- and α1D-AR subtypes. Most interesting, the F18A mutation resulted in an increase in subtype selectivity without a loss in α1B-AR affinity (Figs. 6 and 7). Mutants with high α1B-AR selectivity (F1A, N14A, K16A, and F18A) (Fig. 7) maintained their noncompetitive inhibition at α1B-ARs by progressively decreasing Bmax without affecting KD (Fig. 8). These results suggest that modification of ρ-TIA can increase subtype selectivity without changing its noncompetitive properties in inhibition of α1B-ARs. Among all the alanine-substituted analogs, R4A had the lowest affinity for all three α1-AR subtypes. The R4A mutation was shown previously to impart low affinity binding to hamster α1B-ARs (27Sharpe I.A. Thomas L. Loughnan M. Motin L. Palant E. Croker D.E. Alewood D. Chen S. Graham R.M. Alewood P.F. Adams D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34451-34457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), because of a disruption between the positively charged arginine on ρ-TIA and a complementary negatively charged residue on the α1B-AR. In support of these findings, alanine substitution of arginine at positions 12 and 13 resulted in a decrease in ρ-TIA inhibitory potency (Fig. 6). Therefore, these data suggest that the charged nature of the ρ-TIA plays a role in imparting high affinity interactions with the α1-AR subtypes but does not contribute to its subtype selectivity.Fig. 7Effect of selected alanine substitution on ρ-TIA inhibition potency.

This factor is a target of insulin signal transduction downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway. Akt phosphorylates this factor in vivo and in vitro. Changes in expression level, phosphorylation, and nuclear translocation modulate the transactivation effects of the factor, and its expression is decreased in conditions of diabetes and insulin deficiency.

Insulin regulates metabolism by altering transcription of many genes, and defects in basal and insulin-regulated gene expression may be important in the etiology of “non-insulin dependent” type 2 diabetes mellitus (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 76: 1109-1160Google Scholar).

But because other well defined IREs appear to be different from this sequence and from each other (2O'Brien R.M. Streeper R. Ayala J. Stadelmaier B. Hornbuckle L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 20: 552-558Crossref Google Scholar), it has been postulated that no common trans-acting factor will be associated with all IREs. Insulin mediates its actions through several distinct signal transduction pathways, and multiple pathways of insulin action may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription by insulin. Although insulin-initiated signaling cascades induce changes in nuclear protein phosphorylation, few transcription factors that are phosphorylated in response to insulin have been identified, and none has been unequivocally proven to mediate the effect of insulin on gene transcription. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which these factors transactivate IREs are largely unexplored. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) is the major carrier protein of the mitogenic peptide IGF-1 in the circulation, and insulin is an important regulator of IGFBP-3 in vivo (3Villafuerte B.C. Goldstein S. Murphy L.J. Phillips L.S. Diabetes. 1991; 40: 837-841Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We reported previously that insulin enhances IGFBP-3 gene transcription through a cis-regulatory IRE localized to the –1150 to –1124-bp region (4Villafuerte B.C. Zhao W. Herington A.C. Saffery R. Phillips L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5024-5030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Binding of insulin-responsive nuclear factors to the IGFBP-3 IRE is regulated in vivo; diabetes reduces DNA-protein binding activity of the IRE in rat liver nuclear extracts. Southwestern blotting with an IGFBP-3 IRE probe pointed to an alteration in the quantity and/or activity of a 70- and 90-kDa nuclear protein that binds to the IRE as a potential mechanism for the control of IGFBP-3 transcription by insulin (4Villafuerte B.C. Zhao W. Herington A.C. Saffery R. Phillips L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5024-5030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In search of the trans-acting factors that bind to the IRE of the IGFBP-3 gene, we screened a rat liver cDNA library to identify candidate genes involved in IRE-mediated regulation of IGFBP-3 gene transcription. We report here the identification of a novel transcription factor that binds to the IRE, and transactivates the IGFBP-3 gene. The factor has similar actions on other insulin-responsive genes, and is a target of insulin signal transduction downstream of both the phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase/Akt and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Structurally, this factor contains motifs that are normally associated with extracellular matrix protein but not with other identified transcription factors, suggesting that it belongs to a different class of DNA-binding factor. Insulin treatment alters the phosphorylation state and transactivation potential of the factor, and insulin deficiency in a diabetes model is associated with decreased hepatic mRNA and protein expression of the factor. To recognize its activity in promoting insulin-dependent gene transcription, we named this factor insulin response element-binding protein 1 (IRE-BP1). Because IRE-BP1 is likely a mediator of insulin action on multiple target genes, future studies of the activation and actions of IRE-BP1 may provide important insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetes. Yeast One-hybrid cDNA Library Screening—Using the yeast onehybrid system to screen a rat liver cDNA library (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA), three tandem repeats of the IGFBP-3 IRE (–1150 to –1117 bp) was inserted upstream of a His3 reporter gene under the control of GAL4-responsive promoter, and the resulting plasmid was transformed into YM4271 yeast. Yeast containing the target element were co-transformed with an activation domain (AD) library that contains fusions between target-independent AD (GAL4 AD) and cDNA from normal rat liver. Colonies were selected on His–/Leu– plates with 15 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, and we picked 79 yeast clones. After DNA sequencing and confirmation of the ability of the cDNAs to transactivate a GAL4 promoter linked to a LacZ reporter gene, the cDNA was subcloned into a prokaryotic expression vector for further studies. λ Phage cDNA Library Screening—A 935-bp IRE-BP1 cDNA was used as a probe to screen 108 plaques of a λ bacteriophage rat brain cDNA library (Uni-Zap XR, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as per the manufacturer's protocol. After isolation of the plaques that hybridized with the cDNA probe, the pBluescript phagemid was rescued with the VCSM 12 helper phage, and the cDNA was sent for automated sequencing. Rapid Amplification of cDNA 5′-Ends—Using random hexamers, poly(A)+ mRNA from rat cerebellum (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used as a template for reverse transcription and first strand cDNA synthesis. This was followed by PCR amplification using a forward primer consisting of the anchor primer from the SMART II kit (Clontech), and a reverse primer corresponding to nucleotides 337–312 of the 3.4-kb IRE-BP1 cDNA: 5′-TTGGTGACCTCGAAGTCTTCAATAG-3′. This was repeated several times until no additional 5′ cDNA was obtained. Bacterial Expression of IRE-BP1—A 1503-bp (+1641/+3144) translated cDNA encoding the sequences of IRE-BP1 was subcloned in-frame into the prokaryotic expression vector (pET-32a from Novagen Inc., Madison, WI), transformed into the AD494(DE3) strain of Escherichia coli, and grown at 37 °C until it reached an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm 3 h before harvest. The fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography on immobilized His-bind metal chelation resin (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA), and used for gel shift and Western analysis. Production of Antibody—The C-segment antibody is an epitope of the rat IRE-BP1 between amino acids 786 and 800 and has the following sequence: acetylated Cys-Thr-Ser-Gln-Asn-Thr-Lys-Ser-Arg-Ty-Iso-Pro-Asn-Gly-Lys-Leu. To develop the N-segment antibody, we used the peptide fragment between amino acids 233 and 247, with the following sequence: acetylated Cys-Arg-As-Gly-Gly-Thr-Tyr-Lys-Glu-Thr-Gly-Asp-Glu-Tyr-Arg. Production of the anti-rabbit polyclonal antibodies and its affinity purification were accomplished by BIOSOURCE Inc., Hopkinton, MA. Gel Mobility Shift Analysis—Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the published sequences of the IREs identified from various genes were used for competition (4Villafuerte B.C. Zhao W.

Farwestern Blotting—Double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to the IREs of IGFBP-3, IGF-1, and IGFBP-1 genes were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, then incubated with 20 μg of rat hepatic nuclear extract, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel-shift bands were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and denatured with decreasing concentrations of guanidine HCl, initially at 6 m concentration for 15 min, then at 3, 1.5, 0.75, 0.375, and 0.18 m, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The blot was blocked with 5% milk in phosphate-buffered saline, then incubated with antibodies to IRE-BP1, Sp1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ, as indicated. The protein was visualized with chemiluminescent luminol reagent. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Total cell lysates from HepG2 cells were incubated with rabbit IgG and protein G-agarose at 4 °C for 30 min, then centrifuged. The pre-cleared lysates were transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, incubated with IRE-BP1 cAb or nAb overnight at 4 °C, then with protein G-agarose for 1 h, and centrifuged. The agarose pellet was washed with RIPA buffer 4 times, then run on Western blot. The blotted protein was probed with the IRE-BP1 antibodies as indicated. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—For two-dimensional electrophoresis, cell lysates were dissolved in 2 m thiourea, 7 m urea, 65 mm CHAPS, 58 mm dithiothreitol, and 4.5% ampholytes (pH 4–6). Immobiline dry strips were rehydrated with a 155-μl sample at 25 °C overnight. IEF was performed for a total of 71 750 V-h, with the voltage ramped linearly from 500 to 3500 V during the first 5 h and maintained for 15.5 h at 3500 V. Prior to the second dimension, strips were equilibrated 2 times for 5 min each in equilibration buffer 1 (6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.6, 2% dithiothreitol) and another 5 min in equilibration buffer 2 (6 m urea, 30% glycerol, 2% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2.5% iodacetamide, a trace of bromphenol blue). Vertical second dimension gels were prepared and run (11Powell D. Rane M. Joughin B. Kalmukova R. Hong J.-H. Todor B. Dean W. Pierce W. Klein J. Yaffe M. McLeish K. Mol. Cell.

Mechanism of Stimulation of IGFBP-3 Gene Transcription by Insulin—Hepatic IGFBP-3 synthesis occurs in nonparenchymal cells, particularly Kupffer and sinusoidal endothelial cells, and we have shown previously that insulin stimulates IGFBP-3 gene transcription in these cells (12Villafuerte B.C. Koop B.L. Birdsong G.G. Phillips L.S. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 2044-2050Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 13Villafuerte B.C. Zhang W. Phillips L.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To begin to characterize the mechanism of stimulation of IGFBP-3 transcription by insulin, we used transcription elongation “nuclear run-on” assays (Fig. 1a), and found that the relative transcription rate of IGFBP-3/β-actin was increased 3.6-fold in hepatic nonparenchymal cells after adding 10 nm insulin for 6 h. Stimulation by insulin was inhibited by cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, suggesting that the effect of insulin on IGFBP-3 gene transcription is dependent on the induction of a secondary factor(s). Insulin thus appeared to induce the synthesis and/or binding of a protein to the IRE, and the candidate insulin response factor appeared to be –70 and 90 kDa in size (4Villafuerte B.C. Zhao W. Herington A.C. Saffery R. Phillips L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5024-5030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cloning of the IRE-binding Protein—Using a 34-bp DNA probe based on the IRE in the rat IGFBP-3 gene (4Villafuerte B.C. Zhao W. Herington A.C. Saffery R. Phillips L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5024-5030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we screened a rat liver cDNA library using the yeast one-hybrid system, and obtained 79 clones. After sequencing of the cDNA and binding studies to the IGFBP-3 IRE using gel shift assay, we found that 76 of the 79 clones were false positives, whereas 3 clones produced proteins that bound to the IGFBP-3 IRE. Two of the proteins are known transcription factors, NFκB p65 and HBP1 (high mobility group box containing protein 1) (14Lesage F. Hugnot J. Amri E. Grimaldi P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3685-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The third factor was a novel gene that was not previously reported to the GenBank™. As shown in Fig. 1b, E. coli-expressed NFκB p50 (the binding subunit of NFκB, which forms a heterodimer with the p65 subunit) binds to the IGFBP-3 IRE (lane 5), and NFκB p50 antibody produced a supershift of the band (lane 6). However, antibodies against NFκB p65 or NFκB p50 did not alter binding of rat liver nuclear extract to the IGFBP-3 IRE (lanes 3 and 4 versus 2). Furthermore, the level of expression of NFκB p65 in diabetic rat liver was unchanged compared with normal liver, and co-transfection of expression plasmids of either NFκB p50 or p65 with target constructs containing the IGFBP-3 IRE linked to a luciferase reporter showed neither activation nor repression of the reporter gene (not shown). Whereas HBP1 may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription by insulin, the tissue distribution of HBP1 is ubiquitous (14Lesage F. Hugnot J. Amri E. Grimaldi P. Barhanin J. Lazdunski M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3685-3688Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and not restricted to insulin-sensitive tissues, and HBP1 mRNA is not stimulated by insulin in vivo (Fig. 1c). Therefore, neither NFκB p65 nor HBP1 appears to be the factor in rat liver that transactivated IGFBP-3, so we examined the role of the novel gene in mediating insulin-regulated gene transcription. The original IRE-BP1 cDNA was 936 bp in size, and was used as a probe to screen a rat brain cDNA library, leading to the identification of 8 overlapping clones that were aligned to produce a 3404-bp contiguous sequence. Use of 5′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends provided an additional 1.6-kb DNA of contiguous 5′ sequence. The present IRE-BP1 cDNA is 5043 bp in length, and includes an open reading frame with 3144 bp of translated sequence followed by 1899 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence (GenBank accession number AF439916). The DNA is predicted to encode a protein of 1047 amino acids with a molecular mass of ∼107 kDa. Predicted Protein Structure of IRE-BP1—IRE-BP1 contains multiple cysteine-rich motifs, and the NH2 domain is predicted to form 13 epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like repeats (Fig. 1d). Within the EGF-like repeats is a sushi domain (15Estienne V. Blanchet C. Niccoli-Sire P. Duthoit C. Durand-Gorde J.M. Geourjon C. Baty D. Carayon P. Ruf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35313-35317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-half of IRE-BP1 is organized into three fibronectin type III (FN3) domains, a motif containing ∼100 amino acids that can bind to DNA and interacting proteins (16Krammer A. Lu H. Isralewitz B. Schulten K. Vogel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1351-1356Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A solitary calcium-binding EGF-like domain is also present near the COOH terminus. We generated an antibody to an oligopeptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal segment (amino acids 786–800) of rat IRE-BP1 (cAb). In addition, a 1503-bp (+1641/+3144) translated sequence of the cDNA that encodes the 50-kDa carboxyl portion of the protein was expressed in E. coli as a His6-tagged thioredoxin (Trx) fusion protein, and were purified with Ni2+-nitriloacetate. Fig. 1e shows a Western blot of the induction control (Trx) and the fusion protein (Trx-IRE-BP1) in E. coli lysate. Both the IRE-BP1 antibody and histidine antibody recognized a 65–70-kDa protein, consistent with the predicted size of the fusion protein containing 20 kDa Trx. In Western blotting experiments using hepatic nuclear extracts from normal and streptozotocin-diabetic rats, the IRE-BP1 cAb recognized a 90-kDa protein (Fig. 1f), consistent with the size of the insulin-responsive protein recognized in Southwestern blots using an IGFBP-3 IRE probe (4Villafuerte B.C. Zhao W. Herington A.C. Saffery R. Phillips L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5024-5030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The size of the nuclear factor recognized by cAb appears to be smaller than the predicted size of the protein, however, suggesting that cleavage of the protein may occur. IRE-BP1 expression was reduced in the livers of streptozotocin-diabetic rats compared with normal rats, implying regulation by insulin. IRE-BP1 Binds to Multiple IREs—To study the regulation of IRE-BP1 binding, we used the Trx-IRE-BP1 fusion protein for gel mobility shift analysis. We found that the fusion protein produced a gel shift band with an IGFBP-3 IRE probe, and this band was competed by unlabeled IGFBP-3 IRE oligonucleotide but not by an unrelated NFκB oligonucleotide (Fig. 2a). We then used this system to determine whether IRE-BP1 is also recognized by the IREs of other insulin-responsive genes (also shown in Fig. 2a). Gel mobility shift assays showed that the IREs from the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, IGFBP-1, IGF-I, and amylase genes competed fully for IRE-BP1 binding to the IGFBP-3 IRE, competition was weaker with the IREs from the PEPCK and TAT genes, and there was little competition by the prolactin IRE. Except for the amylase IRE, competition was similar for binding of rat liver nuclear extracts to the IGFBP-3 IRE, presumably reflecting interactions with native IRE-BP1 (Fig. 2b). To further confirm that IRE-BP1 is an IRE-binding protein, we assessed the immunoreactivity of the endogenous protein that binds to the IRE. A Farwestern blot showed that the shifted bands formed between the nuclear extracts and the IREs of IGFBP-3, IGF-I, and IGFBP-1 reacted strongly with the antibodies against IRE-BP1 (Fig. 2c). The shifted bands immunoreacted with both IRE-BP1 cAb and a second antibody developed against an oligopeptide corresponding to the amino segment (amino acids 233–247) of rat IRE-BP1 (nAb). The nAb reacted as two bands under the nondenaturing conditions of the gel shift assay, suggesting that IRE-BP1 may bind as homodimer to the IREs. Specificity of the reaction was shown with a Sp1 antibody, which recognized only Sp1 reacting with the IGF-I IRE as reported previously (17Zhu J.L. Kaytor E.N. Pao C.-I. Meng X.P. Phillips L.S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2000; 164: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ antibody used as a negative control. Interestingly, in these studies the Farwestern technique was more informative than supershift analysis; because denaturation with the use of the Farwestern technique separates individual proteins, it is possible that IRE-BP1 binds to cofactors that interfere with antibody epitope binding, or that the binding of IRE-BP1 to the IRE limits reaction with the antibody. In combination, these findings indicate that the endogenous protein that binds to the IREs studied appears to contain immunoreactive IRE-BP1. Whereas the data show specificity of IRE-BP1 recognition, interactions of IRE-BP1 with multiple genes suggest that IRE-BP1 may be involved in coordinating a variety of responses to insulin. Forkhead box transcription factor 01 (Foxo1) is a transcriptional activator that was previously reported to act through the IRE sequence of the IGFBP-1 gene (18Kops J.P. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), however, a rabbit polyclonal antibody directed against an epitope mapping to amino acids 471–598 of Foxo1 did not react with the IGFBP-1 IRE by this far Western technique, although we were able to detect the presence of Foxo1 in the same preparation of nuclear protein using Western blotting (data not shown). IRE-BP1 Transactivates the Insulin-response Sequence—To test the transactivation potential of IRE-BP1, we subcloned the cDNA into a mammalian expression vector (PCR 3.1), and transiently cotransfected the vector into COS-7 cells with target constructs containing the IGFBP-3 IRE linked to a luciferase reporter (pGL3 promoter). The results showed that a 3.4-kb IRE-BP1 cDNA (+1641/+5043 bp), which includes 1503 bp of translated carboxyl sequence and 1899 bp of 3′-untranslated sequence, increased IRE-linked reporter activity 14-fold but had only a 2-fold effect on the control reporter vector (Fig. 3a). Addition of 10–8m insulin had little effect on the expression with the control vector but produced 3-fold stimulation of the IRE reporter in the presence of IRE-BP1. Thus, there are two components to the stimulation of the IGFBP-3 IRE by IRE-BP1. First, IRE-BP1 appears to bind to the insulin response element and confers basal promoter activity to the reporter gene. Second, modulation of the action of IRE-BP1 by insulin enhanced reporter transcription further, probably through mechanisms that involve phosphorylation or other post-translational effects. Similar findings were obtained with an IGFBP-3 IRE reporter gene transfected into primary cultures of hepatic nonparenchymal cells, where the endogenous factors that bind to the promoter region of IGFBP-3 are presumably localized (shown in Fig. 3b). Compared with an empty expression vector, the IRE region increased reporter activity by 17-fold even in the absence of insulin, consistent with induction of basal promoter activity by the transcription factors that bind to the IRE. Addition of insulin at 10–6m increased reporter activity by a further 2.3-fold, suggesting post-translational modulation of the bound factors by insulin. Therefore, transfected IRE-BP1 transactivates IGFBP-3 IRE by a mechanism likely to be similar to that of the endogenous factor in hepatic cells, in which insulin increased gene transcription above the activity conferred by the factors that bind to the IRE in the basal state. Unexpectedly, cDNA constructs containing additional 5′ sequence (4.8–5.04 kb) increased IRE reporter activity to a much lesser extent than the 3.4-kb cDNA construct (Fig. 3c), consistent with a negative regulatory element in the region 5′ to the 3.4-kb sequence. Structural analysis revealed that the 3.4-kb cDNA (transcriptionally active cDNA) contains three FN3-like domains and the apparent COOH terminus, including the DNA-binding domain (scheme shown in Fig. 3d). Because the added sequence contains most of the EGF-like repeats, these elements may have a silencing effect. The truncated carboxyl-half of the protein (∼50 kDa) thus appears to be sufficient for transcriptional stimulation. To confirm that this cDNA was expressed in the proper context for transfection, coupled in vitro transcription and in vitro translation was conducted with a reticulocyte lysate system to confirm that the transcriptionally active expression vector encodes the predicted 50-kDa size protein, as shown in Fig. 3e. To determine whether IRE-BP1 regulates transcription of other insulin responsive genes, we cotransfected an expression vector that encodes the transcriptionally active cDNA, together with target constructs that contain insulin-responsive sequences identified previously from the IGFBP-1, IGF-1, and prolactin genes. As shown in Fig. 3f, compared with vector alone, IRE-BP1 did not significantly alter the basal transcription rate of the IGFBP-1 IRE reporter gene. However, with addition of insulin, IRE-BP1 decreased IGFBP-1 IRE reporter transcription by 63.2 ± 0.7%, compared with 24.7 ± 5% with vector alone (p < 0.05). Thus, IRE-BP1 enhanced the negative effect of insulin on IGFBP-1 IRE transcription. By contrast, IRE-BP1 increased basal IGF-1 IRE transcription by 4.7 ± 0.1-fold, and by 3.5 ± 0.3-fold in the presence of insulin (both p < 0.05 versus vector only); and IRE-BP1 had no significant effect on the transcription rate of the prolactin IRE. Thus, the ability of IRE-BP1 to activate IRE reporter transcription correlates with its ability to bind to the specific IRE sequence of the gene. Proteolysis and Subcellular Distribution of IRE-BP1—IRE-BP1 cDNA is predicted to encode a protein of ∼107 kDa. Co-transfection studies showed, however, that the truncated carboxyl-half of the cDNA, which encodes a 50-kDa protein, is transcriptionally active. Furthermore, addition of 5′ sequence to the cDNA attenuates the transcriptional activity of the expression vector (shown in Fig. 3c). To determine whether truncation of the protein is required for its biological activation, we separated the cytoplasmic and the nuclear proteins from HepG2 cells (19Dignam J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 192-203Google Scholar), and studied the fractionated extracts by Western blotting using both cAb and nAb. The results showed that the nAb recognized the –120-kDa band in the cytoplasmic extracts, but reacted poorly with the nuclear extracts (Fig. 4a). The increased size from the predicted 107 kDa may be secondary to post-translational modifications of the protein. In contrast, the cAb recognized both the 120-kDa band in the cytoplasmic extracts and a 50-kDa protein in the nuclear extracts. Furthermore, exposure of cells to insulin (10–7m) for 16 h appeared to decrease cytoplasmic IRE-BP1, and increase the 50-kDa carboxyl portion of IRE-BP1 in the nucleus. We also analyzed the subcellular distribution of the protein by confocal laser scanning microscopy. HepG2 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of insulin for 72 h, and immunostained with the cAb or nAb (Fig. 4b). Optical sections through the nucleus showed that the nAb immunoreactivity was localized predominantly t"

Two highly conserved members, MRCKα and -β, have been previously identified and characterized. We now describe a novel isoform, MRCKγ, which is functionally and structurally related to members of this kinase family. We show these kinases to have marked similarities in their genomic organization, substrate phosphorylation, and catalytic autoinhibition. Unlike MRCKα and -β, which are expressed ubiquitously, MRCKγ mRNA was only expressed in heart and skeletal muscle. In cultured cells, MRCKγ showed differential expression with high levels of expression only in certain cell lines. DNA analysis showed that lack of expression is correlated with promoter DNA methylation. We have mapped the methylation sites in the MRCKγ promoter. Significantly, agents that suppressed DNA methylation caused increases in the expression of the kinase in low-expressing cells, further supporting the notion that promoter DNA methylation plays an important role in the expression of MRCKγ. Analysis of the MRCKγ promoter has also revealed two proximal Sp1 sites that are essential for transcriptional activity. We conclude that both promoter DNA methylation and Sp1 binding are important regulators for MRCKγ expression.

The non-kinase Rac1/Cdc42-binding Wiskott Aldrich's syndrome protein WASP and related n-WASP are also downstream targets and are essential for actin polymerization, through their interaction with Arp2/3 (5Suetsugu S.

A well conserved motif for the interaction of Rac1/Cdc42 (Cdc/Rac1-interactive binding, CRIB motif) has been identified when comparisons were made with a number of the Rac1/Cdc42-binding proteins such as PAK, ACK, and WASP (6Hoffman G.R.

Although the exact function of these kinases remains to be characterized, the catalytic domain homology suggests a similar function to Rho kinases ROKs, which are known to enhance the phosphorylation status of myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2), directly by phosphorylation or indirectly by phosphorylation and inactivation of myosin-targeting subunits of myosin phosphatase (9Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 10Muranyi A.

MRCKs, resembling ROKs, can phosphorylate and activate LIM kinases, which phosphorylate and inactivate cofilin, thereby facilitating actin polymerization events (12Sumi T. Matsumoto K. Shibuya A. Nakamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23092-23096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). At the cellular level, MRCK has been shown to be involved in regulating cell morphology by enhancing Cdc42-induced membrane extensions (8Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and the dominant negative form of MRCKα can block nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells (13Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274Google Scholar). The Drosophila autologue Genghis Khan (GEK) has also been implicated in actin polymerization events during development (14Luo L. Lee T.

A region in the distal coiled-coil region (CC2/3) was found to be essential for kinase inhibition, but the exact location has not been mapped previously. Activation of the kinase was observed upon binding of phorbol ester to the neighboring cysteine-rich domain, presumably by releasing the constraint of the inhibitory effect on the catalytic activity (15Tan I.

Both MRCKα and MRCKβ are ubiquitously expressed in various mammalian tissues and are abundantly expressed in all cell lines studied (18Bush E.W. Helmke S.M. Birnbaum R.A. Perryman M.B. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8480-8490Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 19Tan I. Cheong A. Lim L. Leung T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 304: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Interestingly, MRCKα is present as multiple species through differential splicing (20Moncrieff C.L. Bailey M.E. Morrison N. Johnson K.J. Genomics. 1999; 57: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), mainly at an internal variable splice site, which is located between the inhibitory region and the phorbol-binding cysteine-rich domain. Whether or not these sequence diversities play any roles in MRCK function remains to be determined. The characterization of yet another member, MRCKγ, has not been reported. We now describe the biochemical and functional characterization of MRCKγ. The expression of this kinase show marked variation in some cell lines, and this is dependent on the methylation status of its promoter DNA as well as on Sp1 binding. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Cell Staining—HeLa, Hct116, and MRC5 cells were cultured in minimum Eagle's medium, MCF7 and MKN28 cells were grown in RPMI medium, and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and cell cultures were maintained in humidified 5% CO2. Subconfluent cells plated on culture dishes for 24 h were transfected with respective DNA constructs using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the recommended protocol. For immunostaining experiments, transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with anti-FLAG antibody (M2; Sigma). Construction of Expression Vectors—A 997-bp DNA fragment covering the CpG islands and the putative Sp1 binding sites of the putative MRCKγ promoter was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from Hct116 cells using the primer pair 5′-GTC TGA AGC CAC CAA TAT GTC-3′ (forward)/5′-CTG CTC GGC TAC AGT CTG G-3′ (reverse) and Hotstar Taq (Qiagen). The PCR products were cloned into pDrive vector (Qiagen) and sequenced. The HindIII/KpnI DNA fragment was subcloned into pGL3 basic vector to generate pGL3-1 (–844 to +152). To generate 5′ deletion constructs, forward primers (5′-GCT CCT ACT GAA GCT TAA AAC G-3′; 5′-CAG GTA CCA TCT GCC AAA TGG GCG-3′; and 5′-CAG GTA CCT TCA CCT CTA GCC GCG-3′) were paired up with the reverse primer to generate pGL3-2 (–622 to +152), pGL3-3 (–522 to +152), and pGL3-5 (–73 to +152), respectively. pGL3-4 (–357 to +152) was generated by digesting pGL3-1 with NcoI (blunted) and HindIII and subcloned into pGL3 basic vector cut with SmaI and HindIII. ΔBSSHII (deleted from –84 to –36) and Δ SacII (deleted from –307 to –61) constructs were generated by digestion with BSSHII and SacII, respectively, and religated. The primer pair 5′-GCT CCT ACT GAA GCT TAA AAC G-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGA CGG GCA GGT GCG CGC-3′ (reverse) was used to generate pGL3-2Δ3′ (–622 to –23). Full-length MRCKγ was obtained by PCR of the Hct116 cDNA using the primer pair 5′-CAG GAT CCA TGG AGC GGC GGC TGC GC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTG CGG CCG CCC TAA CAG AGG GCA TCA A-3′ (reverse). The nucleotide sequences encoding the 103 amino acids (residues 670–772) of MRCKγ kinase inhibitory motif (KIM) were obtained by PCR using the primer pair 5′-CAG GAT CCG GTG AGC GGC GGG AGA CG-3′ and 5′-CTG CGG CCG CTG TCA GCC GCT CCT GCA GCT GCA GG-3′. The 309-bp BamHI-digested PCR fragment was subcloned into BamHI/SmaI-digested pXJ40-GST vector for mammalian cell transfection. All sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pXJ40-HA-MRCKγ-CAT and pGEX-MRCKγ-CAT were generated by the digestion of full-length MRCKγ with BamHI/StuI and subcloned into their respective vectors digested with BamHI/SmaI. GST·MRCKγ· CRIB domain was obtained from a pGEX-vector containing the PCR product from primers 5′-CAG GAT CCT TTG TGC GCT CCA AGC TCA T-3′ and 5′-CTG CGG CCG CCC TAA CAG AGG GCA TCA A-3′. Other constructs used have been described previously (8Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Tan I. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 15Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation and Kinase Assays—COS-7 cells expressing HA·MRCKα·CAT or HA·MRCKγ·CAT alone or co-expressed with GST· MRCKγ·KIM were lysed in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1mm sodium vanadate, 5% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and immunoprecipitations were performed essentially as described (15Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using either gluthathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) or anti-HA antibody (12CA5; Roche Applied Science). Kinase assays with 10 μg of substrates ((histone H1, myelin basic protein, GST fusion of myosin light chain-2 (MLC-2), or GST fusion of the phosphorylation inhibitory motif of myosin phosphatase MBS85 (GST·PIM)) and 0.1 μg of the immunoprecipitated kinase were carried out as described previously (15Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The reactions were stopped by the addition of sample buffer, and the proteins were resolved by 11% SDS-PAGE, dried, and autoradiographed. Western Blot Analysis—Protein expression was detected by Western immnunoblotting. Cells were harvested in lysis buffer, and 100 μg of proteins were separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE. MRCKα, -β, and -γ proteins were detected by specific antibodies raised against MRCKα, -β, and -γ, respectively. In Vitro GTPase Binding Assay—GST fusion proteins (50 ng) of MRCKα and MRCKγ containing the CRIB domain were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Immobilized proteins were first renatured for 3–4 h at 4 °C in renaturing buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 5 mm dithiothreitol) and subjected to probing with solution containing either [γ-32P]GTP-labeled GST·Cdc42 or TC10 as described previously (21Manser E. Leung T. Salihiddin H. Tan L. Lim L. Nature. 1993; 363: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Probed filters were washed three times and autoradiographed. Northern Blot Analysis—Blots containing mRNA from various human tissues were obtained from Clontech and were hybridized with a C-terminal [32P]-labeled 3-kb NheI/NotI fragment from full-length MRCKγ (nucleotides 1610–4661). Cell Treatment with 5-Aza-CdR and Trichostatin A and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—HeLa cells were plated onto 90-mm2 dishes 18–24 h prior to experiments. 5-Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR; Sigma) was freshly added onto cells every 24 h at a final concentration of 1 μm for 48 h. 100 ng/ml trichostatin A (Sigma) was added at the last 12 h of the cell treatment with 5-Aza-CdR. Total RNA from treated or untreated cells with drugs was obtained using the Qiagen RNeasy® RNA isolation kit. cDNA was reverse-transcribed from the total RNA using M-MuLV reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs). PCR was then performed using Hotstar Taq and the CRIB domain primers. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 15 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and a final extension of 72 °C for 5 min. Primers for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (5′-TCC ATC ACC ATC TTC CAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-ATG AGT CCT TCC ACG ATA CC-3′ (reverse)) were used for similar PCR as control. For amplification of the internal splice site, primers 5′-TAG CAG GAA GAC CTT CTG TAG-3′/5′-TGG AGC TGC AGT CAG CGC T-3′ were used. The PCR products were subcloned into pDrive vector and sequenced. Determination of Transcriptional Initiation Site—RT-PCR was performed using Hct116 poly(A)+RNA to determine the transcriptional initiation site. Several primers close to the putative initiation site of MRCKγ (including primer 1, 5′-GAA GGT GAC AGC GGG GAGG-3′; primer 2, CCA GGT GAG GGC GCG CTG-3′; primer 3, 5′-CGG CGC CCA GGT GAG GGC-3′; and primer 4, 5′-GGC TCC CAT TGG CCG GCG-3′) were synthesized to pair up with the reverse primer 5′-CTG CTG AGC TCG TGG TGC A-3′. Various annealing temperatures for each primer pair were used for optimizing reaction conditions using genomic DNA as template, and the right-sized products from RT-PCR were subcloned into pDrive vector for DNA sequencing. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Hct116 cells were transfected with various MRCKγ luciferase reporter gene constructs, and cells were harvested for luciferase assays using the single luciferase assay system (Promega). pXJ40-HA-Sp1 was also co-transfected with pGL3-2 to determine the effect of Sp1 on the promoter activity. A cytomegalovirus promoter-β-galactosidase reporter (pCMV-β-galactosidase) construct was also included to monitor transfection efficiency. Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts and Electromobility Shift Assays (EMSA)—Preparation of whole cell extracts from HeLa, MKN28, and COS-7 transfected cells was performed according to Manley et al. (22Manley J. Fire A. Cano A. Sharp P.A. Gefter M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3855-3859Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), and EMSA was performed essentially as described previously (23Garg L.C. Dixit A. Webb M.L. Jacob S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2134-2138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide used for EMSA was the consensus Sp1 binding site (underlined) in MRCKγ promoter (5′-CCC CGG CCC GCC CCC GCA CTT-3′; see Fig. 5B). The oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed with its complementary strand (5′-AAG TGC GGG GGC GGG CCG GGG-3′). A DNA fragment of 205 bp (–263 to –59) with sequences spanning the tandem Sp1 binding sites was also used for EMSA. The 32P-radiolabeled primer pair (5′-CAG GTA CCG CGC CTC CTG GGT CA-3′/5′-GCT AGA GGT GAA GGT GGG-3′) was used for PCR of the 205-bp DNA fragment. Unlabeled competitors were added in 100-fold excess to the reaction mix prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. For supershift assays, 2 μg of the polyclonal Sp1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added to the binding reaction prior to the addition of radiolabeled probe. The DNA-protein complex was then size-fractionated by using 5% PAGE in 0.5× Tris-borate EDTA buffer at 150 V at 4 °C. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Preparation of Genomic DNA and McrBC Digestion—The genomic DNA from various cell lines was prepared using a DNeasy® tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 250 ng of genomic DNA were cleaved with McrBC (New England Biolabs) in a final reaction volume of 25 μl at 37 °C for 1 h. The heat-inactivated cleavage mixture (2.5 μl) was used for PCR using primers 5′-GTC TGA AGC CAC CAA TAT GTC-3′ and 5′-CTG CTC GGC TAC AGT CTG G-3′. Bisulphite Modification and Sequencing—For mapping of methylated cytosine residues, genomic DNA samples from Hct116 and HeLa cells were modified by bisulphite reaction using the CpGenome™ DNA modification kit (Intergen Inc.), and the final products were amplified with primers 5′-GGG TTT AAT TTA AGA GTT ATT TTG-3′ (forward)/5′-CTA TCA CCT TCC TCC-3′ (reverse), which were specific for the modified MRCKγ sequence. PCR was performed with the BD Advantage™ 2 system (BD Biosciences) and started at 95 °C for 1 min followed by 5 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min, with a decrease of 2 °C in annealing temperature per cycle. After another 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min and a final extension of 68 °C for 3 min, the PCR products were cloned into pDrive vector, and 20 separate clones for each cell lines were sequenced for analysis. MRCKγ Is a Novel Member of the MRCK Serine/Threonine Kinase Family—We have previously reported two members, MRCKα and MRCKβ, in this class of Rho GTPase-binding serine/threonine kinases. Sequences of a related kinase have been reported in the databases (e.g. accession number XM_290516), but hitherto, no reports of its biochemical and functional characterization have been reported. We have now isolated and characterized the human cDNA of this novel kinase. The sequence codes for a new member of the MRCK family, which we have termed MRCKγ (Fig. 1A). The organization of domains in MRCKγ is similar to the other MRCKs, and comparisons with MRCKα revealed the following sequence identity (in percent) in the various domains: kinase (73%), cysteine-rich (54%), pleckstrin homology (47%), Citron homology (42%), and CRIB (53%). The coiled-coil domain in MRCKγ is much shorter (mainly in the proximal coiled-coil 1 (CC1) region) and more diverse (29%). Within the coiled-coil domain, there is a highly conserved motif (66% identical to MRCKα), termed the KIM because of its unique property of interacting with, and inhibiting activity of, the kinase (Figs. 1, A and B, and 2A) (see also Ref. 15Tan I. Seow K.T. Lim L. Leung T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2767-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). MRCKγ has a molecular mass of about 160 kDa, when compared with 180 kDa for the other known family members, the main difference being due to the shorter CC1 domain. Phylogenetic analysis of the MRCK family showing its relationship to the mammalian and invertebrate counterparts is presented in Fig. 1C. The gene is located at chromosome 11q13. Analysis of the genomic sequence reveals the coding sequence to reside within 36 exons (Fig. 1, A and B) with an organization that is markedly similar to that of MRCKα (19Tan I. Cheong A. Lim L. Leung T. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 304: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and MRCKβ (Ref. 20Moncrieff C.L. Bailey M.E. Morrison N. Johnson K.J. Genomics. 1999; 57: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar and data not shown). However, the overall size of the gene is only about 30 kb, which is far more compact than the 250 kb reported for MRCKα and the 130 kb reported for MRCKβ.Fig. 1Genomic and sequence organization of human MRCKγ.A, DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of human MRCKγ. The bolded letters represent the exon-intron boundaries. The amino acid sequence is represented in order from the N terminus to the C terminus, and the kinase domain, kinase inhibitory motif, cysteine-rich domain, pleckstrin homology domain, Citron homology domain, and Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif are highlighted. B, genomic structure of the human MRCKγ gene. In the top panel, the exons are boxed and numbered, and introns known to be above 1 kb are shown. Lower panel, protein domain arrangement of MRCKγ organized from deduced amino acid sequence. Corresponding exons and amino acid sequences in the subdomains are linked by dotted lines. Subdomain arrangements for MRCKα and -β were also shown for comparison. N, N-terminal region; C, CRIB motif; CC, coiled-coil domain; V, internal variable region; CR, cysteine-rich C1 domain; PH, pleckstrin homology domain; CNH, Citron homology domain. C, a phylogenetic tree of members of the MRCK family. Amino acid sequences of the various MRCKs from NCBI and Fugu databases were analyzed using the Clustal phylogenetic analysis from DNASTAR. The numerals denote the number of residues that are varied from each other.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 2Biochemical characterization and cellular localization of MRCKγ.A, a, substrate specificity of MRCKα·CAT and MRCKγ·CAT. Kinase assays with histone H1 (H1), myelin basic protein (MBP), GST·myosin light chain (GST·MLC-2), and GST·PIM were used as substrates, which were marked with asterisks. b, the inhibitory effects of MRCKγ·KIM on the catalytic activities of MRCKα and MRCKγ. HA·MRCKα·CAT and HA·MRCKγ·CAT constructs were expressed alone (lanes 1 and 3) or co-expressed with GST·MRCKγ·KIM construct (lanes 2 and 4). Immunoprecipitations were carried out using anti-HA antibody (lanes 1 and 3) or glutathione-Sepharose beads (lanes 2 and 4), and the immunoprecipitates recovered were assayed for kinase activity using GST·MLC-2 as substrate. Blotted filters were also immunostained with anti-HA and anti-GST antibodies after autoradiography. c, KIM motif alignment. KIM motifs of various MRCKs from human and Drosophila were aligned with the Clustal method (DNASTAR). Conserved residues are boxed in black, and the numbers indicate the positions of residues. B, sequence alignment of the CRIB sequences of human hMRCKα, hMRCKβ, and hMRCKγ, Fugu fMRCKα, Drosophila GEK, and Caenorhabditis elegans ceMRCK was performed as described in the legend for Fig. 1. The bottom panels show the in vitro GTPase binding assay of MRCKα and MRCKβ. Purified GST fusion proteins containing the CRIB domain of MRCKα and MRCKγ immobilized on polyvinylidene difluoride filters were assayed for binding with [γ-32P]GTP-labeled Cdc42 (left panel) or [γ-32P]GTP-labeled TC10 (right panel). C, Northern blot analysis of MRCKγ. The mRNA blot was purchased from Clontech and probed with a 3-kb DNA fragment from the 3′ end of human MRCKγ. S. Muscle, smooth muscle. D, analysis of the internal splice site in MRCKγ. A primer pair specific for covering the internal splice site in the human sequence was used to amplify total cDNA prepared from MKN 28 cells. For a control, a primer pair specific for sequence in the C-terminal region was used to amplify the same cDNA. The marker lane (Mr) is shown in bp. The numbered boxes represent exons present in the corresponding bands as revealed by DNA sequencing. The bottom panel represents the deduced amino acid sequence of exons involved in alternate splicing at the internal splice site. E, HeLa cells were stained with anti-FLAG antibody for detecting the expressed MRCKγ. The arrows show MRCKγ localized mainly at the cytoplasm, with higher density at the leading edges.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Biochemical Characterization, Expression, and Cellular Localization of MRCKγ—The marked homology of the kinase domain of MRCKγ with those of MRCKα/β and Rho kinases ROK inferred similar substrate specificity. A GST kinase domain fusion protein of MRCKγ was tested for this. Like MRCKα, MRCKγ kinase phosphorylated the known substrates, MLC-2 and a fragment from the myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase MBS85 (GST·PIM; Fig. 2A) but not histone H1 nor myelin basic protein. The conserved KIM motif of MRCKγ (amino acid residues 677–765 in CC2/3) also bound the kinase domain of MRCKα and MRCKγ and inhibited their catalytic activity (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with MRCKγ sharing similar substrate specificity and conserved auto-inhibitory mechanism with the other MRCK kinases. The CRIB domain responsible for Cdc42/Rac1 interaction in MRCKγ is far less conserved when compared with other MRCK counterparts (Fig. 2B). We therefore tested the binding of GST·MRCKγ·CRIB to RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42 as well as the related TC10 GTPase. Although this CRIB domain can bind Cdc42, it binds more strongly to TC10 (Fig. 2B). It binds Rac1 weakly but not RhoA (data not shown). It seems that MRCKγ differs from the other MRCK isoforms in that it may interact preferentially with Rho GTPases other than Cdc42 and Rac1. Apart from TC10, the identity of any other GTPase binding and their physiological roles remain to be determined. Northern blot analysis of MRCKγ revealed that a 6-kb message was expressed in human heart and skeletal muscle (Fig. 2C). By immunological analysis, the protein was found to be also highly expressed in a number of cell lines, including MKN28 cells (Fig. 3A). RT-PCR of MKN28 cells showed a differential splicing event at the internal variable region within exons 21–23 (Fig. 1B), with the major product containing exons 21/22/23 and minor products containing alternative exons 21/22a/23 or 22/23 alone (Fig. 2D). Extensive splicing events in this region have been documented for MRCKα (20Moncrieff C.L. Bailey M.E. Morrison N. Johnson K.J. Genomics. 1999; 57: 297-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and MRCKγ has adopted a similar but simpler processing. However, other splicing events occurring at the CRIB domain and C-terminal of MRCKα were not observed with MRCKγ. When expressed in HeLa cells, FLAG-tagged MRCKγ was mainly cytoplasmic with a higher density at the leading edges (Fig. 2E). Distinctive Expression Pattern of MRCKγ in Various Cell Lines Determined by Promoter Activity—We used specific antibodies to the different isoforms of MRCKs to evaluate their relative expression in the soluble fractions derived from a variety of human and mammalian cell lines. Although the protein expression of MRCKα and MRCKβ was ubiquitous, that of MRCKγ was more restricted. High expression was detected in MKN28, HCT116, and MCF7 cells but not in HeLa, MRC5, and COS-7"
https://openalex.org/W2064999942,"We used the maltose transport complex MalFGK2 of the Escherichia coli cytoplasmic membrane as a model for the study of the assembly of hetero-oligomeric membrane protein complexes. Analysis of other membrane protein complexes has led to a general model in which a unique, ordered pathway is followed from subunit monomers to a final oligomeric structure. In contrast, the studies reported here point to a fundamentally different mode for assembly of this transporter. Using co-immunoprecipitation and quantification of interacting partners, we found that all subunits of the maltose transport complex efficiently form heteromeric complexes in vivo. The pairwise complexes were stable over time, suggesting that they all represent assembly intermediates for the final MalFGK2 transporter. These results indicate that several paths can lead to assembly of this oligomer. We also characterized MalF and MalG mutants that caused reduced association between some or all of the subunits of the complex with this assay. The mutant analysis highlights some important motifs for subunit contacts and suggests that the promiscuous interactions between these Mal proteins contribute to the efficiency of complex assembly. The behaviors of the wild type and mutant proteins in the co-immunoprecipitations support a model of multiple assembly pathways for this complex.

The biogenesis of membrane protein complexes is a critical cellular activity that is difficult to study and poorly understood. Because of the technical challenges, the assembly of multimeric membrane protein structures has been extensively characterized in only a few cases. From studies on models such as the acetylcholine receptor, the T-cell antigen receptor, and the major histocompatibility complex Class I loading complex, it has been concluded and is generally accepted that membrane complexes have an ordered assembly pathway (1Manolios N.

Microbiol. 1998; 29: 685-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). This is a powerful model because the biochemistry and genetics of the system are highly developed, and numerous mutants are available. This complex consists of the integral membrane proteins MalF and MalG and the peripheral cytoplasmic membrane ATP-binding protein MalK, which form a 1:1:2 complex that transports maltose into the cell. MalFGK2 is a part of the ATP-binding cassette transporter superfamily in which members share a common domain structure with high sequence similarity in the ATP-binding domain (8Boos W. Lucht J.M.

Cell. 1995; 82: 693-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The domains can be linked into a single polypeptide or be separated into different proteins that assemble into multimeric complexes.Previously, we demonstrated that MalK forms a dimer in the absence of the MalF/MalG membrane proteins and suggested that this interaction may represent an initial step in the assembly of this complex (10Kennedy K.A. Traxler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6259-6264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This dimer is the dominant species in the population of MalK molecules found in soluble cellular extracts. We want to identify other interactions among MalF, MalG, and MalK as part of our analysis of the in vivo folding pathway for this complex. Assuming the participation of the MalK dimer, the possible pathways for tetramer formation are: 1) F + G + K2 → FG + K2 → FGK2, 2) F + G + K2 → FK2 + G → FGK2, and 3) F + G + K2 → F + GK2 → FGK2.The analysis of membrane protein complex formation has generally relied on cellular co-fractionation studies or identification of stable subcomplexes of various subunit combinations to define intermediates in an assembly pathway. Previous experiments in other laboratories examining the MalFGK2 assembly pathway have produced varied and even contradictory results. One study suggests that MalK associates with MalF in the absence of MalG but not with MalG in the absence of MalF (consistent with pathway 2) (11Panagiotidis C.H. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Boos W. Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23685-23696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Earlier work provides evidence consistent with pathway 3 but not pathway 2 (12Shuman H.A. Silhavy T.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) found that both MalF and MalG are required for MalK to fractionate with the membrane, consistent with pathway 1 (13Mourez M. Hofnung M. Dassa E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3066-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). They propose that the EAA loop, a highly conserved hydrophilic motif present in a cytoplasmic domain of MalF and of MalG, might act as a primary contact point with MalK. Recently, the crystal structure of the homologous BtuCD ATP-binding cassette transporter of E. coli also revealed primary contacts between EAA-related cytoplasmic loops of the transmembrane subunit BtuC and the BtuD nucleotide-binding domain, consistent with the importance of the MalF/MalG EAA loops for associating with MalK (14Locher K.P. Lee A.T. Rees D.C. Science. 2002; 296: 1091-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 15Chang A.C.Y. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 69: 301-315Crossref Scopus (871) Google Scholar). The current availability of structural data on ATP-binding cassette transporters and of a diverse collection of Mal mutants suggests that the biogenesis of this transporter now may be productively re-evaluated.In the following experiments, we examined the intermolecular associations among all three subunits of the MalFGK2 complex using immunoprecipitation techniques. Evidence for an ordered pathway in the T-cell antigen receptor assembly includes the ability of certain combinations of subunits (but not others) to co-immunoprecipitate when expressed pairwise in cultured cells (1Manolios N. Letourneur F. Bonifacino J.S. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1643-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 2Kearse K.P. Roberts J. Singer A. Immunity. 1995; 2: 391-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Similarly, finding that certain combinations of Mal subunits can associate, whereas others cannot (or that the subunits associate with substantially different affinities), would suggest a particular order for the assembly of this complex. However, we found that each component of the maltose transporter efficiently formed an immunoprecipitable complex with each of the others when they are expressed pairwise in a cell, consistent with a non-ordered or “promiscuous” assembly pathway. Furthermore, we expressed mutant Mal proteins, previously characterized for their ability to oligomerize into the MalFGK2 complex, in both two- and three-protein combinations. The behavior of the mutant and wild type proteins was evidence for a novel assembly strategy employing multiple pathways for this heteromeric complex.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESBacterial Strains and Plasmids—Various compatible plasmids (Table I) were combined in strain BT6 (MC1000 ΔmalB101 zjb::Tn5 (ΔmalE,F,G,K,lamB,malM) F'128lacIq). When co-expressed, malF and malG alleles were carried by the same plasmid. Insertion mutations in malK and malG were described previously (17Nelson B.D. Traxler B. J.

The htmalK gene of plasmid pSS733 expresses an N-terminal-tagged form of MalK (HT-MalK) with six His residues and a thrombin cleavage site (19Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J.

Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was used at 1 mm.Preparation of Labeled Whole Cell Extracts—Cultures were grown with aeration in M63 medium at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.3. For experiments with plasmid-borne mal alleles, 1 ml of culture was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 min and then labeled by the addition of 79 or 158 μCi [35S]Met (Expre35S35S label, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 5 min. For experiments with chromosomal mal alleles, uninduced cells were labeled for 5 min. Labeling was stopped by the addition of 0.05% cold Met, and the cultures were immediately placed on ice. For pulse-chase experiments, 2 ml of culture were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 min, and then 158 μCi of [35S]Met was added. After 5 min, 0.05% cold Met was added, and 1 ml of culture was removed and placed on ice (pulse sample). After 15 min of additional incubation at 37 °C, a 1-ml chase sample was placed on ice. The cells were harvested, washed one time with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA (buffer A), and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of buffer A. The resuspended cells were lysed with one 15-s burst of a probe sonicator. The lysates were stored at -80 °C.Immunoprecipitation of Protein Complexes—Sonicated whole cell lysates were solubilized with 1% dodecyl maltoside for 20 min on ice. Unlysed cells and insoluble material (less than 5-10% of the total labeled signal) were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was diluted 1:10 in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.01% dodecyl maltoside). Antiserum was added and incubated on ice for 1 h. Immune complexes were recovered with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences; 50% in buffer B) after incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, as described by Kennedy and Traxler (10Kennedy K.A. Traxler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6259-6264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated samples were heated to 65 °C for 20 min in gel-loading buffer before the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Antisera used included a polyclonal antiserum specific for MalF (21Traxler B. Beckwith J. Proc. Natl. Acad. of Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10852-10856Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), a polyclonal antiserum specific for the 31-residue insertion sequence (22Manoil C. Bailey J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and a monoclonal antiserum specific for the His6 thrombin tag (Katze Laboratory, University of Washington). Control experiments showed that 70-80% of the labeled protein recognized by the antibody was recovered in the primary immunoprecipitations. Co-immunoprecipitations done with supernatant fractions after a primary immunoprecipitation showed the same relative proportions of proteins recovered in the secondary immunoprecipitation step.For the in vitro mixing studies, the lysates of cells expressing different combinations of Mal subunits were solubilized with dodecyl maltoside as above and then mixed. The extracts were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h, and then the appropriate antiserum was added. The samples were processed for immunoprecipitation as described above.Quantitation—Phosphorimages were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics phosphorimaging device (SF or Storm), and the data were analyzed with the IQMac software version 1.2. Because the intensity of each protein on a phosphorimage is directly proportional to the number of 35S-containing residues in each molecule, the relative proportions of the proteins (data reported in the text and in the tables) were calculated by dividing the intensity of the band with the number of cysteines and methionines in each different protein; thus normalizing the values for the purpose of quantitative comparison. The quantitations of co-immunoprecipitations were averaged from independently labeled and immunoprecipitated extracts. Differences in association between Mal subunits of ±0.02-0.03 are not considered significant in our analysis, consistent with the background present in control studies between MalF and TsrR47 (see “Results” below).RESULTSCoimmunoprecipitation of the MalFGK2Complex—To study the biogenesis of the integral membrane maltose transporter, we characterized proteins from pulse-labeled cell extracts that should contain fully and partially assembled complexes. In the majority of our experiments, the Mal subunits were expressed from plasmids in a strain with a deletion at the chromosomal malFGK locus so that the proteins of interest were labeled at high specific activity. MalF, MalG, and one of two functional epitope-tagged MalK derivatives, either His6-tagged MalK (HT-MalK) or MalK containing a 31-amino acid insertion (MalK550), were co-expressed (10Kennedy K.A. Traxler B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6259-6264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 19Davidson A.L. Sharma S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 5458-5464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proteins were immunoprecipitated using an antiserum that recognizes one of the maltose transporter subunits, either MalF-specific or HT-specific (for HT-MalK) or i31-specific (for MalK550 or other i31 mutants).In experiments similar to that shown in Fig. 2, the MalF-specific or a MalK-specific antiserum was used to co-immunoprecipitate all three Mal proteins from cell extracts containing MalF, MalG, and MalK (Fig. 2). Quantification of the proteins co-immunoprecipitated showed that different proportions of the Mal subunits were recovered with the different antisera. The MalF-specific antiserum captured higher proportions of MalF, whereas the MalK-specific antiserum recovered higher proportions of MalK relative to the other Mal proteins (Table II), indicating the presence of unassembled Mal proteins and of partially and fully assembled Mal complexes in these extracts. These experiments are distinct from those of Davidson and Nikaido (23Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) who co-immunoprecipitated the subunits of the maltose transporter in proportions of 0.25 MalF:0.25 MalG: 0.50 MalK using a MalF-specific antiserum. In that study, the Mal proteins were expressed from the chromosomal genes and were immunoprecipitated from steady-state labeled membrane preparations to look specifically at the stoichiometry of the fully assembled complex. The relative proportions of Mal subunits in our immunoprecipitations likely are because of our conditions, which are designed to examine the assembly process and to facilitate the characterization of mutants. In addition, we used whole cell extracts instead of isolated membranes, which allows us to capture soluble MalK not associated with the membrane. Even so, when HT-MalK was expressed from a lower copy number plasmid (and MalK is presumably limiting for tetramer assembly), the relative proportions of proteins recovered in our co-immunoprecipitations with the HT-specific antibody were similar to the expected ratios for the intact transporter (Table II, line 3).Fig. 2Co-immunoprecipitation of the MalFGK2 components. BT6 strains containing plasmids expressing combinations of MalF, MalG, and MalK550 were radiolabeled. Solubilized extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation with MalF-specific antiserum (lanes 1-6) or with i31-specific antiserum (lanes 7-11). The MalF, MalG, and MalK550 proteins (F, G, K550) that were present in each extract are indicated by + under each lane. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and visualized with a phosphorimaging device. The samples here were prepared in one experiment; however, the MalFMalG extract shown in lane 5 was not as highly labeled as the others.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether the expression of the Mal proteins from plasmids impacts the relative proportions of the different subunits that co-immunoprecipitate, we did similar experiments using extracts from pulse-labeled cells expressing the Mal proteins from their chromosomal genes. The relative proportions of MalF:MalG:MalK in the chromosomal expression experiments were very similar to that observed in the plasmid-based expression experiments (Table II, lines 1-3). We concluded that our results were not due to artifacts from overexpression from high copy number genes and that our experimental conditions were appropriate for examining MalFGK2 biogenesis.Coimmunoprecipitation of Mal Protein Subcomplexes—The simplest interpretation of our data from these co-immunoprecipitations is that we recovered a variety of fully and partially assembled Mal protein complexes. We extended these studies and tested which components of the maltose transporter associate to produce intermediate complexes that could participate in tetramer assembly. From analogous studies done in other model systems (e.g. major histocompatibility loading complex, Ref. 4Diedrich G. Bangia N. Pan M. Cresswell P. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1703-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), we expected that some combinations of Mal proteins would not result in co-immunoprecipitation of both proteins or would show co-immunoprecipitation with substantially differing efficiencies.Pairwise combinations of mal genes were expressed and the extracts subjected to immunoprecipitation with the MalF- or a MalK-specific antiserum. (No antiserum that is appropriate for immunoprecipitating a functional form of MalG is available.) In each case (MalF/MalG, MalF/MalK, MalG/MalK), both proteins were immunoprecipitated by an antiserum to one of the proteins present (Fig. 2 and Table III). In every combination, the co-immunoprecipitated protein constituted a significant fraction (8-16%) of the total protein signal recovered (Table III). These data indicate that each maltose transporter subunit is competent to associate to a substantial degree with each of the other subunits, raising the possibility that each of these combinations may represent assembly intermediates of the complex. Extracts from cells expressing two different pairwise combinations of the Mal proteins from their chromosomal genes gave similar results (Table III, lines 1 and 6). In each case, the degree of association between the pairs was less than that observed when all three components were expressed.Table IIIProportions of Mal Subunits precipitated from 2-protein expressing cellsMal proteins expressed(n)aThe strains expressing MalF/MalG and MalF/MalK from the normal chromosomal locus (data in italics) were HS3169 and BT45, respectively., b(n) is the number of independently labeled and immunoprecipitated extracts analyzed for each combination; the proportions from each experiment were averaged to give these values.Relative proportionsαFcαF, αHT, and αi31 are immunoprecipitations done with antiserum specific for MalF, for His6 thrombin tag, and for the 31-residue insertion, respectively.αHTcαF, αHT, and αi31 are immunoprecipitations done with antiserum specific for MalF, for His6 thrombin tag, and for the 31-residue insertion, respectively.αi31MalF+MalG+(4)0.93:0.07NANAMalF+MalG+(11)0.88:0.12NANAMalF+MalGEAA(2)0.82:0.18NA0.90:0.10MalFpd2MalG+(1)0.87:0.13NA0.85:0.15MalF+MalGpd3(4)0.89:0.11NANTfNT, not tested.MalF+MalK+(4)0.82:0.18NANAMalF+MalK+(4)0.84:0.16dThe proportions given in bold indicate that the antiserum used was specific for the protein expressed from the lower copy number plasmid.

Open table in a new tab To evaluate the stability of the various heteromeric complexes, we compared the recovery of the Mal protein subcomplexes from extracts labeled with a 5-min pulse versus a 5-min pulse with a 15-min chase (with continued expression of unlabeled subunits). For the combinations of MalF/MalG, MalF/HTMalK, and MalG/HT-MalK, there was no more than a 1% change in any of the proportions of species that co-immunoprecipitate (e.g. when MalF and MalG were co-expressed, MalF-specific antiserum recovered proportions of 0.84 MalF:0.16 MalG at the pulse versus 0.85 MalF:0.14 MalG after the chase; this is the averaged data from three independent experiments). (Likewise, when all three components of the maltose transporter were co-expressed in pulse-chase studies, there was only a modest change in the proportions of the proteins recovered, consistent with continuing assembly of the tetrameric complex; data not shown.) 80-100% of the MalF and/or MalK subunits present at the pulse time points persisted until the end of the chase, indicating that degradation by endogenous proteases was not occurring. These data indicate that the labeled heteromeric subcomplexes were stable; they did not disassemble and reassemble with unlabeled subunits produced during the chase. Furthermore, none of the heteromeric complexes was degraded by cellular proteases as misfolded protein.To determine whether proteins were able to associate spuriously and co-immunoprecipitate under these experimental conditions, we performed two control studies. First, we tested if the pairwise Mal protein complexes form in vitro after protein solubilization. Extracts expressing MalF, MalG, and HT-MalK individually were mixed, and MalF- or HT-specific antiserum was added. In no case did we detect a significant (greater than 2% of total signal) co-immunoprecipitation of a Mal subunit that was not specifically recognized by the added antiserum, implying that the interactions we detected were formed in vivo. Second, we tested the effectiveness of the membrane solubiliza"
