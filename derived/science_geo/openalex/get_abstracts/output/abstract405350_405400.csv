https://openalex.org/W2134053452,"T cell differentiation into distinct functional effector and inhibitory subsets is regulated, in part, by the cytokine environment present at the time of antigen recognition. Here, we show that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a key metabolic sensor, regulates the balance between regulatory T cell (Treg) and TH17 differentiation. HIF-1 enhances TH17 development through direct transcriptional activation of RORγt and via tertiary complex formation with RORγt and p300 recruitment to the IL-17 promoter, thereby regulating TH17 signature genes. Concurrently, HIF-1 attenuates Treg development by binding Foxp3 and targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Importantly, this regulation occurs under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Mice with HIF-1α-deficient T cells are resistant to induction of TH17-dependent experimental autoimmune encephalitis associated with diminished TH17 and increased Treg cells. These findings highlight the importance of metabolic cues in T cell fate determination and suggest that metabolic modulation could ameliorate certain T cell-based immune pathologies."

https://openalex.org/W2142215232,"Whole genome comparisons identified introgression from archaic to modern humans. Our analysis of highly polymorphic human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I, vital immune system components subject to strong balancing selection, shows how modern humans acquired the HLA-B*73 allele in west Asia through admixture with archaic humans called Denisovans, a likely sister group to the Neandertals. Virtual genotyping of Denisovan and Neandertal genomes identified archaic HLA haplotypes carrying functionally distinctive alleles that have introgressed into modern Eurasian and Oceanian populations. These alleles, of which several encode unique or strong ligands for natural killer cell receptors, now represent more than half the HLA alleles of modern Eurasians and also appear to have been later introduced into Africans. Thus, adaptive introgression of archaic alleles has significantly shaped modern human immune systems."

The hierarchical pore systems thus formed allow better adsorption, diffusion, and reactivity of these materials. By combining organic and inorganic structure-directing agents and high-throughput methodologies, we were able to synthesize a zeolite with a hierarchical system of micropores and mesopores, with channel openings delimited by 28 tetrahedral atoms. Its complex crystalline structure was solved with the use of automated diffraction tomography."
https://openalex.org/W1973268713,"O-Phosphoserine (Sep), the most abundant phosphoamino acid in the eukaryotic phosphoproteome, is not encoded in the genetic code, but synthesized posttranslationally. Here, we present an engineered system for specific cotranslational Sep incorporation (directed by UAG) into any desired position in a protein by an Escherichia coli strain that harbors a Sep-accepting transfer RNA (tRNA(Sep)), its cognate Sep-tRNA synthetase (SepRS), and an engineered EF-Tu (EF-Sep). Expanding the genetic code rested on reengineering EF-Tu to relax its quality-control function and permit Sep-tRNA(Sep) binding. To test our system, we synthesized the activated form of human mitogen-activated ERK activating kinase 1 (MEK1) with either one or two Sep residues cotranslationally inserted in their canonical positions (Sep(218), Sep(222)). This system has general utility in protein engineering, molecular biology, and disease research."

https://openalex.org/W2060896332,"Tamas Horvath and his colleagues show that in states of obesity activation of the transcription factor PPAR-γ in POMC neurons occurs, resulting in an increase in peroxisome proliferation. This cellular event leads to reduced ROS levels in these cells, decreased neuronal firing and increased food intake. They also show that central pharmacological inhibition of PPAR-γ reverses these effects, suggesting a possible way to combat obesity. Previous studies have proposed roles for hypothalamic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the modulation of circuit activity of the melanocortin system1,2. Here we show that suppression of ROS diminishes pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) cell activation and promotes the activity of neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and agouti-related peptide (AgRP)-co-producing (NPY/AgRP) neurons and feeding, whereas ROS-activates POMC neurons and reduces feeding. The levels of ROS in POMC neurons were positively correlated with those of leptin in lean and ob/ob mice, a relationship that was diminished in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. High-fat feeding resulted in proliferation of peroxisomes and elevated peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) mRNA levels within the hypothalamus. The proliferation of peroxisomes in POMC neurons induced by the PPAR-γ agonist rosiglitazone decreased ROS levels and increased food intake in lean mice on high-fat diet. Conversely, the suppression of peroxisome proliferation by the PPAR antagonist GW9662 increased ROS concentrations and c-fos expression in POMC neurons. Also, it reversed high-fat feeding–triggered elevated NPY/AgRP and low POMC neuronal firing, and resulted in decreased feeding of DIO mice. Finally, central administration of ROS alone increased c-fos and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (pStat3) expression in POMC neurons and reduced feeding of DIO mice. These observations unmask a previously unknown hypothalamic cellular process associated with peroxisomes and ROS in the central regulation of energy metabolism in states of leptin resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2021350823,"Cell-penetrating peptides can translocate across the plasma membrane of living cells and thus are potentially useful agents in drug delivery applications. Disulfide-rich cyclic peptides also have promise in drug design because of their exceptional stability, but to date only one cyclic peptide has been reported to penetrate cells, the Momordica cochinchinensis trypsin inhibitor II (MCoTI-II). MCoTI-II belongs to the cyclotide family of plant-derived cyclic peptides that are characterized by a cyclic cystine knot motif. Previous studies in fixed cells showed that MCoTI-II could penetrate cells but kalata B1, a prototypic cyclotide from a separate subfamily of cyclotides, was bound to the plasma membrane and did not translocate into cells. Here, we show by live cell imaging that both MCoTI-II and kalata B1 can enter cells. Kalata B1 has the same cyclic cystine knot structural motif as MCoTI-II but differs significantly in sequence, and the mechanism by which these two peptides enter cells also differs. MCoTI-II appears to enter via macropinocytosis, presumably mediated by interaction of positively charged residues with phosphoinositides in the cell membrane, whereas kalata B1 interacts directly with the membrane by targeting phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipids, probably leading to membrane bending and vesicle formation. We also show that another plant-derived cyclic peptide, SFTI-1, can penetrate cells. SFTI-1 includes just 14 amino acids and, with the exception of its cyclic backbone, is structurally very different from the cyclotides, which are twice the size. Intriguingly, SFTI-1 does not interact with any of the phospholipids tested, and its mechanism of penetration appears to be distinct from MCoTI-II and kalata B1. The ability of diverse disulfide-rich cyclic peptides to penetrate cells enhances their potential in drug design, and we propose a new classification for them, i.e. cyclic cell-penetrating peptides.

CPPs can be conjugated with a cargo (i.e. oligonucleotide, peptide sequence, or polysaccharide) and efficiently deliver it inside cells, and so they are of great importance in the field of drug delivery. The most extensively studied CPPs are the Tat peptide, derived from the HIV-1 transactivator of transcription protein (1Vivès E. Brodin P. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16010-16017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar), and penetratin, derived from the third helix of the Drosophila Antennapedia homeodomain (2Derossi D. Joliot A.H. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10444-10450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the last 20 years, many different CPPs have been identified from a range of sources. However, only one cyclic peptide has been reported to pass through cell membranes, i.e. the cyclotide Momordica cochinchinensis trypsin inhibitor II (MCoTI-II) (3Greenwood K.P. Daly N.L. Brown D.L.

Cyclotides are head-to-tail cyclic peptides that contain ∼30 amino acids, including six conserved cysteine residues that form a cyclic cystine knot (CCK) at the core of their structure (6Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Bond T. Waine C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1327-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). The use of the stable CCK motif as a drug scaffold has emerged as an interesting field of research in recent years (7Craik D.J. Mylne J.S. Daly N.L. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2010; 67: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 8Henriques S.T. Craik D.J. Drug Discov. Today. 2010; 15: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 9Kolmar H. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 2684-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In particular, the exceptional stability of the CCK motif makes it an ideal framework for molecular engineering and drug design applications (10Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Waine C. Toxicon. 2001; 39: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 11Craik D.J. Cemazar M. Daly N.L. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov. Dev. 2006; 9: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar, 12Jagadish K. Camarero J.A. Biopolymers. 2010; 94: 611-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For example, the CCK peptides MCoTI-II and kalata B1 have been successfully engineered to introduce new bioactivities to the molecules (13Avrutina O. Schmoldt H.U. Gabrijelcic-Geiger D. Wentzel A.

Chem. 2008; 51: 7697-7704Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The versatility of the CCK framework together with the cell-penetrating properties of MCoTI-II makes this mini-protein of special interest for applications in drug design. MCoTI-II has been reported to be internalized into cells by macropinocytosis (3Greenwood K.P. Daly N.L. Brown D.L. Stow J.L. Craik D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 2252-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), but the specific mechanism by which this occurs has not been determined. Furthermore, possible interactions of MCoTI-II with phospholipids or receptors in cell membranes, and the eventual fate of the molecule within cells, have not been determined. In this study, an analysis of the cellular uptake of MCoTI-II and the prototypic cyclotide kalata B1 is presented. These two peptides are representative examples of two subfamilies of cyclotides (17Craik D.J. Daly N.L. Mulvenna J. Plan M.R. Trabi M. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2004; 5: 297-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and have very different sequences (Fig. 1). For comparison, another cyclic peptide, the sunflower trypsin inhibitor 1 (SFTI-1) (18Luckett S. Garcia R.S. Barker J.J. Konarev A.V. Shewry P.R. Clarke A.R. Brady R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 525-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar), is also examined here, and all three cyclic peptides were found to penetrate cells. As the number of cell-penetrating peptides increases, it is becoming important to develop and maintain appropriate classification schemes. We propose that the cyclic peptides examined in this study constitute a new family of CPPs that we refer to as cyclic cell-penetrating peptides (CCPPs). Cyclic peptides have advantages over their linear counterparts because they have extraordinary stability (19Craik D.J. Science. 2006; 311: 1563-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 20Colgrave M.L. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5965-5975Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar) and CCPPs appear to be promising molecules in the field of drug delivery. MCoTI-II was extracted from the seeds of M. cochinchinensis as described previously (21Felizmenio-Quimio M.E. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Kalata B1 was extracted from the leaves of O. affinis (22Plan M.R. Göransson U. Clark R.J. Daly N.L. Colgrave M.L. Craik D.J. ChemBioChem. 2007; 8: 1001-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Both peptides were purified by RP-HPLC and masses analyzed using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ES-MS). The peptides synthesized in this study are summarized in Table 1. MCoTI-II single mutants (K6A, K9A, and K10A), kalata T20K (kT20K), kalata V25K (kV25K) and SFTI-1 were synthesized using a native chemical ligation strategy as previously described (23Huang Y.H.

A MCoTI-II double mutant MCoKKAA (where Lys 9 and 10 are replaced with alanine residues) was assembled by Fmoc solid phase peptide synthesis in a polyethylene glycol-polystyrene (PEG) resin with a preloaded Lys (Applied Biosystmes, Australia) using an automatic peptide synthesizer (Liberty). Aspartimide formation at the DG motif was effectively suppressed by the introduction of Fmoc-2,4-dimethoxybenzyl (Merck) protection at the Gly backbone nitrogen. The linear peptide was oxidized in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate at pH 8 overnight and purified by RP-HPLC. The oxidized peptide was cyclized with immobilized trypsin (Promega) as previously described (25Thongyoo P. Jaulent A.M. Tate E.W. Leatherbarrow R.J. ChemBioChem. 2007; 8: 1107-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A linear Tat peptide was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid phase peptide synthesis using an automatic peptide synthesizer (Liberty) following standard Fmoc chemistry on a 2-chlorotrityl chloride resin. The deprotected peptide was cleaved using trifluoroacetic acid. All peptides were purified using preparative RP-HPLC to purity >95%.TABLE 1Peptides examined in this studyPeptideSequenceSynthesis and cyclization methodMCoTI-II(MCo)Cyclic-(GGVCPKILKKCRRDSDCPGACICRGNGYCGSGSD)Plant extractionMCoKKAACyclic-(GGVCPKILAACRRDSDCPGACICRGNGYCGSGSD)Fmoc, trypsin cyclizationMCoK6ACyclic-(GGVCPAILKKCRRDSDCPGACICRGNGYCGSGSD)Boc chemistry, thioesterMCoK9ACyclic-(GGVCPKILAKCRRDSDCPGACICRGNGYCGSGSD)Boc chemistry, thioesterMCoK10ACyclic-(GGVCPKILKACRRDSDCPGACICRGNGYCGSGSD)Boc chemistry, thioesterKalata B1 (kB1)Cyclic-(GLPVCGETCVGGTCNTPGCTCSWPVCTRN)Plant extractionkT20KCyclic-(GLPVCGETCVGGTCNTPGCKCSWPVCTRN)Boc chemistry, thioesterkV25KCyclic-(GLPVCGETCVGGTCNTPGCTCSWPKCTRN)Boc chemistry, thioesterSFTI-1Cyclic-(GRCTKSIPPICFPD)Boc chemistry, thioesterTat(48–57)GRKKRRQRRRFmoc chemistry, linear Open table in a new tab For NMR studies peptides were dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O at a concentration of ∼1 mm at pH 3.2. Spectra were recorded at 298K on a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer. 1H one-dimensional and TOCSY and NOESY two-dimensional spectra were recorded. The three Lys residues of MCoTI-II and the Lys of kT20K were conjugated with a 5-fold molar excess of NHS-biotin (Quantum Scientific) in 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 8, for 2 h at room temperature. Both labeled peptides were purified by RP-HPLC using an analytical column, and the mass was confirmed by ES-MS. Alexa-488 was purchased from Molecular Probes. Native MCoTI-II, MCoTI-II mutants (MCoKKAA, MCoK6A, MCoK9A, and MCoK10A), kT20K, kV25K, and SFTI-1 were conjugated with Alexa-488 for cellular uptake studies. Equal moles of Alexa-488 were incubated with the peptides for 3 h at room temperature while being gently shaken. The conjugated peptides were purified by RP-HPLC, and the mass was confirmed by ES-MS. Peptides containing only one labeled Lys were selected. MCoTI-II and derivatives have several Lys residues in the sequence that could potentially contain the introduced Alexa-488. To determine which Lys was labeled, the peptides were reduced and trypsinized as described previously (26Chen B. Colgrave M.L. Wang C. Craik D.J. J. Nat. Prod. 2006; 69: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The fragments resulting from the digestion were subjected first to MALDI-TOF-MS (Applied Biosystems) and then sequenced by ES-MS/MS using a nanospray instrument (API-QSTAR). Small unilamellar vesicles with a diameter of 50 nm were prepared by extrusion as described previously (27Henriques S.T. Pattenden L.K. Aguilar M.I. Castanho M.A. Biophys. J. 2008; 95: 1877-1889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and used for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies. Briefly, the small unilamellar vesicles were prepared from lipid films using a combination of freeze-thaw fracturing and sizing by extrusion. Lipid solutions in chloroform were dried under a stream of N2, and residual organic solvent was removed in vacuum (16 h). The lipid film was hydrated with HEPES buffer and subjected to eight freeze-thaw cycles to produce multilamellar vesicles. To produce small unilamellar vesicles, multilamellar vesicles were extruded through polycarbonate filters with a 50-nm pore size (19 times). Synthetic lipids were used to prepare model membranes as follows: palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylglycerol (POPG), and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE). Lipid vesicles were prepared in 10 mm HEPES buffer with 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, for SPR studies. All measurements were performed using a BIAcore 3000 system (GE Healthcare). The interaction of the peptides with lipid bilayers was studied using different lipid mixtures; the molar ratio of each lipid in the mixture is specified in parentheses: 1 mm POPC, POPC/POPG (4:1), and POPC/POPE (4:1). The binding of the peptides to the lipid bilayers was followed by SPR as described previously (28Henriques S.T. Huang Y.H. Rosengren K.J. Franquelim H.G. Carvalho F.A. Johnson A. Sonza S. Tachedjian G. Castanho M.A. Daly N.L. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 24231-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). All solutions were prepared with 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl. The interaction of MCoTI-II, kalata B1, and SFTI-1 with various lipids was performed with strips of nitrocellulose membranes commercialized as PIP StripsTM (Invitrogen) as described previously (29Mabrouk K. Ram N. Boisseau S. Strappazzon F. Rehaim A. Sadoul R. Darbon H. Ronjat M. De Waard M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 2528-2540Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The final concentration of the peptides was 1 μm. Heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) from basement membrane (mass >400 kDa) was purchased from Sigma. The interaction of HSPG with the peptides was performed by SPR in two different experiments. In the first experiment, HSPG (0.25 mg/ml) was incubated overnight at 37 °C with POPC lipid vesicles to allow the protein to partition into the membrane. Then the lipid-HSPG system was deposited onto the L1 sensor chip surface (2 μl/min, 2400 s contact time). Peptides were injected over the lipid surface (5 μl/min, 180 s), and dissociation followed for 600 s per injection cycle. In the second experiment, the lipid vesicles were injected into the chip (2 μl/min, 2400 s contact time) followed by the injection of the HSPG (0.8 mg/ml). Peptides were then injected (5 μl/min, 180 s). Experiments were performed in 10 mm HEPES with 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Heparan sulfate (HS) from bovine kidney (∼14 kDa) was purchased from Sigma. HS was biotinylated via the amino groups. A solution of 5 mg/ml HS was incubated with a 15-fold molar excess of EZ-link NHS biotin (Pierce) for 3 h at room temperature. The unconjugated biotin was removed by filtration in a Centricon 3 (Amicon). The sample was recovered in 10 mm HEPES with 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.4, for SPR measurements. The interaction of the peptides with HS was studied using an SA chip, which was derivatized with streptavidin. The biotin-labeled HS was coupled to the surface of the SA chip at two different concentrations in independent channels (0.2 and 2 μg/ml). One channel was left untreated and served as a negative control. Next, the peptide was injected over the HS surface in independent injections (5 μl/min, 180 s), and dissociation followed for 600 s per injection cycle. The experiments were performed in 10 mm HEPES with 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. Human MCF-7 breast cancer cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 20 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1% insulin (Sigma), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (IRH Bioscience Inc.). Mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage-like cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 units/ml penicillin (Invitrogen), 20 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (Invitrogen), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (IRH Bioscience Inc.). Cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell viability was evaluated by a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay. MCF-7 or RAW 264.7 cells were seeded at 1 × 105 cells/ml in sterile 96-well microtiter plates overnight in their supplemented media. The day after, various concentrations of the peptides were added to the plates, and the cells were incubated for 24 h. 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide reagent (Sigma) was then added to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated for 3 h. The 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide reagent was then removed, and the precipitated formazan crystals were dissolved by adding 100 μl of isopropyl alcohol to each well. The plates were read at 590 nm using a Powerwave XS plate reader (Bio-Tek). To study the cellular uptake of the various peptides, 1 × 105 MCF-7 or RAW 264.7 cells were seeded onto live cell imaging plates (MatTek Corp.) and let stand overnight. The following day, the cell culture medium was removed, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in fresh medium containing the Alexa-488-conjugated peptide at the specified concentration. After incubation, extracellular peptide was washed out, and CO2-independent media (Invitrogen) were added. The cellular uptake was analyzed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Zeiss LSM 510) using a 63× oil immersion objective. Cells were maintained at 37 °C during live cell imaging. For three-dimensional time-lapse imaging, confocal Z-stacks were sequentially captured and reconstructed using the LSM software (Zeiss). To stain the membrane, the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Alexa-647 conjugate (Invitrogen) was used. MCF-7 or RAW 264.7 cells were seeded onto a 24-well plate at 1 × 105 cells/ml and left to set down overnight. The following day, the cells were incubated with 5 μm Alexa-488-labeled-peptide for 1 h to allow cellular uptake. Peptide was then washed out twice with the corresponding supplemented media. A final wash with PBS was performed prior to trypsinization with 2.5 mg/ml trypsin for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped via the addition of 4 volumes of media. Next, the cells were collected and centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed with PBS and resuspended in 500 μl of PBS. To quench the extracellular membrane-bound peptide, the cells were treated with 25 μg/ml trypan blue and immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (BD FACSCanto II). Live cells were gated by forward/side scattering from a total of 10,000 events. MCF-7 cells were pretreated for 30 min with the macropinocytosis inhibitor ethylisopropylamiloride (EIPA) at 100 μm. Cells were then treated with Alexa-488-labeled peptide (5 μm) and incubated in either the presence or absence of EIPA for 1 h prior to flow cytometric analysis. The peptides examined in this study are summarized in Table 1. MCoTI-II and kalata B1 were extracted from plant material. For the sake of brevity, hereafter these peptides are referred as MCo and kB1, respectively. A double alanine mutant of MCo was synthesized by substituting Lys-9 and Lys-10 with Ala residues. The MCo double mutant (MCoKKAA) was synthesized and cyclized via an enzyme-mediated approach (25Thongyoo P. Jaulent A.M. Tate E.W. Leatherbarrow R.J. ChemBioChem. 2007; 8: 1107-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The similarity of the αH NMR chemical shifts of MCoKKAA to those of native MCo confirmed that the mutant peptide had the same overall structure as the native peptide (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2A). The single point mutants MCoK6A, MCoK9A, and MCoK10A were synthesized by manual Boc chemistry and cyclized and oxidized in a single step. The peptides maintained the native fold based on analysis of αH chemical shifts (supplemental Fig. S2A). For monitoring cellular uptake by flow cytometry and microscopy, peptides were labeled with Alexa-488. The labeled residues were identified and are highlighted in Table 1. Native kB1 does not contain any Lys residues and therefore a Lys was introduced at position 20 (kT20K) to allow labeling with Alexa-488. This mutant was chosen because it has similar structure, bioactivity, and membrane-binding properties to wild-type kB1 (23Huang Y.H. Colgrave M.L. Clark R.J. Kotze A.C. Craik D.J. J. Biol.

An inactive mutant of kB1 (kV25K) was used as a negative control (23Huang Y.H. Colgrave M.L. Clark R.J. Kotze A.C. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 10797-10805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Structural analysis show that both mutants maintain the fold of the native peptide (supplemental Fig. S2B). Cyclic SFTI-1, originally derived from sunflower seeds, was synthesized by Boc chemistry, and NMR studies confirmed that it adopted the native conformation (supplemental Fig. S2C) (30Daly N.L. Chen Y.K. Foley F.M. Bansal P.S. Bharathi R. Clark R.J. Sommerhoff C.P. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 23668-23675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been reported that MCo penetrates cells, whereas kT20K remains bound to cell membranes (3Greenwood K.P. Daly N.L. Brown D.L. Stow J.L. Craik D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 2252-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These studies were done in fixed cells with biotin labeling of the peptides. Recent evidence suggests that fixation of cells can lead to artifactual redistribution of membrane-bound peptides into the cytoplasm and nucleus (31Richard J.P. Melikov K. Vives E. Ramos C. Verbeure B. Gait M.J. Chernomordik L.V. Lebleu B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 585-590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest to reevaluate the cell penetration of cyclic peptides by live cell imaging using Alexa-488-labeled peptides. Hereafter Alexa-488 will be referred to as Alexa. Two cell lines were examined, the macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 and the breast cancer cell line MCF-7. The two cell lines were used to allow comparison with the previous studies of cellular uptake of MCo and kT20K (3Greenwood K.P. Daly N.L. Brown D.L. Stow J.L. Craik D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 2252-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To choose a nontoxic concentration to perform the assays, the cell viability was evaluated in the presence of 5 and 15 μm concentrations of labeled peptides. The cytotoxicities of MCo-Alexa and kT20K-Alexa conjugates were tested in RAW 264.7 and MCF-7 cells. In accordance with previous studies (3Greenwood K.P. Daly N.L. Brown D.L. Stow J.L. Craik D.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2007; 39: 2252-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), kT20K-Alexa was toxic to cells at concentrations >5 μm, whereas MCo-Alexa was not toxic at the concentrations tested (supplemental Fig. S3). Consequently, the experiments with MCo- and kT20K-Alexa conjugates were carried out at 5 μm. To study cellular uptake into MCF-7 or RAW 264.7 cells, 5 μm Alexa-labeled MCo or kT20K was incubated with the cells for 1 h. Live cell imaging by confocal microscopy showed that both MCo- and kT20K-Alexa conjugates were present inside MCF-7 and RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 2). Confocal microscopy images suggested that MCo-Alexa and kT20K-Alexa were located in endosomal compartments (Fig. 2), sized from 1 to 2 μm. Endosomes larger than 0.2 μm are defined as macropinosomes (32Swanson J.A. Watts C. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 424-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 33Kerr M.C. Teasdale R.D. Traffic. 2009; 10: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), and therefore it is probable that MCo-Alexa and kT20K-Alexa were present in macropinosomes. Macropinosomes containing MCo-Alexa and kT20K-Alexa were more abundant in RAW 264.7 than in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2). This result is consistent with the enhanced macropinocytic activity of macrophages as part of their surveillance role in the immune response (32Swanson J.A. Watts C. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 424-428Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). The presence of kT20K in endosomal compartments was surprising because kT20K interacts with the plasma membrane, and therefore, it was expected that it would enter the cells by direct membrane interaction and be located in the cytoplasm. To evaluate if MCo-Alexa and kT20K-Alexa colocalize with the plasma membrane in living cells, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with Alexa-647 (WGA-Alexa-647) was added to MCF-7 cells to label the plasma membrane. WGA is a lectin that binds to N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylneuraminic acid (34Wright C.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 178: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Binding of MCo-Alexa to the cell membrane was not observed (Fig. 2), but kT20K-Alexa was partly located in endosomes (Fig. 2) and partly attached to the cell membrane (Fig. 2, white arrowhead). Endocytosis is inhibited at low temperatures (35Steinman R.M. Mellman I.S. Muller W.A. Cohn Z.A. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar); therefore, to corroborate that MCo-Alexa and kT20K-Alexa follow an endocytic pathway, internalization experiments were conducted at 4 °C. As expected, MCo-Alexa was not present inside RAW 264.7 or MCF-7 cells at 4 °C (Fig. 3A). Similarly, kT20K-Alexa did not enter cells at 4 °C. This suggests that both peptides penetrate cells by endocytosis. By contrast, peptides that penetrate cells by membrane translocation have been reported to penetrate cells with the same efficiency at 4 and 37 °C (36Henriques S.T. Costa J.

Large amounts of solar helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar) trapped in various depths in the grains were observed, which can be explained by multiple implantations of solar wind particles into the grains, combined with preferential He loss caused by frictional wear of space-weathered rims on the grains. Short residence time of less than 8 million years was implied for the grains by an estimate on cosmic-ray-produced (21)Ne. Our results suggest that Itokawa is continuously losing its surface materials into space at a rate of tens of centimeters per million years. The lifetime of Itokawa should be much shorter than the age of our solar system."

https://openalex.org/W1968138449,"We aimed to evaluate activation of macrophages in insulin-sensitive tissues (liver, adipose tissue, and muscles) under high-fat diet (HFD) and elucidate the role of Kupffer cells (KC) in HFD-induced insulin resistance. Tissue macrophage populations, insulin signaling, and sensitivity were evaluated in mice fed a HFD for 4 or 16 wk. Selective KC depletion was obtained by intravenous injections of liposome-encapsulated clodronate. Mice fed a HFD for 4 to 16 wk have hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance together with macrophage recruitment in the adipose tissue but not in the liver. Depletion of KC for the last 10 d of the 16 wk experiment fails to improve insulin sensitivity compared to PBS-treated animals. In contrast, preventive KC depletion prior to and during the 4 wk HFD attenuates the development of obesity, adiposity, adipose tissue inflammation (P<0.01 vs. PBS group), and insulin resistance (P<0.01). Interestingly, in mice fed a normal diet, prolonged KC depletion ameliorates insulin sensitivity and decreases adiposity without altering physiological body weight gain or food intake. Preventive and prolonged KC depletion ameliorates insulin sensitivity and prevents adipose tissue inflammation, suggesting a communication between the liver and the adipose tissue in the development of HFD-induced metabolic alterations.—Lanthier, N., Molendi-Coste, O., Cani, P.

It has become more and more evident that this class of small RNAs plays critical roles in the regulation of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. MEF2A is a member of the MEF2 (myogenic enhancer factor 2) family of transcription factors. Prior report showed that the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the Mef2A gene mediated its repression; however, the molecular mechanism underlying this intriguing observation was unknown. Here, we report that MEF2A is repressed by miRNAs. We identify miR-155 as one of the primary miRNAs that significantly represses the expression of MEF2A. We show that knockdown of the Mef2A gene by siRNA impairs myoblast differentiation. Similarly, overexpression of miR-155 leads to the repression of endogenous MEF2A expression and the inhibition of myoblast differentiation. Most importantly, reintroduction of MEF2A in miR-155 overexpressed myoblasts was able to partially rescue the miR-155-induced myoblast differentiation defect. Our data therefore establish miR-155 as an important regulator of MEF2A expression and uncover its function in muscle gene expression and myogenic differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2039140507,"Septic shock results from bacterial infection and is associated with multi-organ failure, high mortality, and cardiac dysfunction. Sepsis causes both myocardial inflammation and energy depletion. We hypothesized that reduced cardiac energy production is a primary cause of ventricular dysfunction in sepsis. The JNK pathway is activated in sepsis and has also been implicated in impaired fatty acid oxidation in several tissues. Therefore, we tested whether JNK activation inhibits cardiac fatty acid oxidation and whether blocking JNK would restore fatty acid oxidation during LPS treatment. LPS treatment of C57BL/6 mice and adenovirus-mediated activation of the JNK pathway in cardiomyocytes inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α expression and fatty acid oxidation. Surprisingly, none of the adaptive responses that have been described in other types of heart failure, such as increased glucose utilization, reduced αMHC:βMHC ratio or induction of certain microRNAs, occurred in LPS-treated mice. Treatment of C57BL/6 mice with a general JNK inhibitor (SP600125) increased fatty acid oxidation in mice and a cardiomyocyte-derived cell line. JNK inhibition also prevented LPS-mediated reduction in fatty acid oxidation and cardiac dysfunction. Inflammation was not alleviated in LPS-treated mice that received the JNK inhibitor. We conclude that activation of JNK signaling reduces fatty acid oxidation and prevents the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α down-regulation that occurs with LPS."

In endothelial cells (ECs), VEGF binds VEGF receptors and activates ERK1/2 through the phospholipase γ (PLCγ)-PKCα-B-Raf pathway.

However, the role of NCX activity in VEGF signaling and angiogenic functions of ECs had not previously been described. Here, using human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs), we report that extracellular Ca2+ is required for VEGF-induced ERK1/2 activation and that release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores alone, in the absence of extracellular Ca2+, is not sufficient to activate ERK1/2.

PLM palmitoylation was confirmed by immunoprecipitating PLM from ARVM loaded with [3H]palmitic acid and immunoblotting following streptavidin affinity purification from ARVM lysates subjected to fatty acyl biotin exchange. Mutagenesis identified both Cys-40 and Cys-42 of PLM as palmitoylated.

We determined the role of cytosolic NT5 in metabolic responses linked to the development of insulin resistance in obesity and type 2 diabetes. Using siRNA to silence NT5C2 expression in cultured human myotubes, we observed a 2-fold increase in the AMP/ATP ratio, a 2.4-fold increase in AMPK phosphorylation (Thr(172)), and a 2.8-fold increase in acetyl-CoA carboxylase phosphorylation (Ser(79)) (p < 0.05). siRNA silencing of NT5C2 expression increased palmitate oxidation by 2-fold in the absence and by 8-fold in the presence of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-β-d-ribofuranoside. This was paralleled by an increase in glucose transport and a decrease in glucose oxidation, incorporation into glycogen, and lactate release from NT5C2-depleted myotubes. Gene silencing of NT5C1A by shRNA injection and electroporation in mouse tibialis anterior muscle reduced protein content (60%; p < 0.05) and increased phosphorylation of AMPK (60%; p < 0.05) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (50%; p < 0.05) and glucose uptake (20%; p < 0.05).

Disaccharide compositional analyses also uncovered an HS disaccharide uniquely enriched in MPSIH, representing the terminal iduronic acid residue capping the non-reducing end of the HS chain, where no further degradation can occur in the absence of Idua. Critically, we identified that excess HS, some of which is colocalized to the Golgi secretory pathway, acts as a positive regulator of HS-sulfation, increasing the N-sulfotransferase activity of HS-modifying N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase enzymes. This mechanism may have severe implications during disease progression but, now identified, could help direct improved therapeutic strategies."

Flow cytometry, the cobblestone area-forming cell assay, and the methycellulose colony-forming unit assay were used to assess medullary and mobilized hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blots were used to measure hematopoietic cytokine production. Histochemistry was also used to assess adaptations to exercise in the bone marrow niche. Depending on the cell type, endurance training increased medullary and mobilized hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell content from 50 to 800%. Training also reduced marrow cavity fat by 78%. Skeletal muscle hematopoietic cytokine expression was also increased at least 60% by training. Sedentary mice served as controls for the above experiments.

Therefore, a set of nucleobase analogues was treated with β-propiolactone, and reaction products were identified and quantified. NMR revealed at least one modification in either deoxyguanosine, deoxyadenosine, or cytidine after treatment with β-propiolactone. However, no reaction products were found from thymidine and uracil. The most reactive sides of the nucleobase analogues and nucleosides were identified by NMR. Furthermore, a series of synthetic peptides was used to determine the conversion of reactive amino acid residues by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. β-Propiolactone was shown to react with nine different amino acid residues. The most reactive residues are cysteine, methionine, and histidine and, to a lesser degree, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, tyrosine, lysine, serine, and threonine. Remarkably, cystine residues (disulfide groups) do not react with β-propiolactone. In addition, no reaction was observed for β-propiolactone with asparagine, glutamine, and tryptophan residues. β-Propiolactone modifies proteins to a larger extent than expected from current literature. In conclusion, the study determined the reactivity of β-propiolactone with nucleobase analogues, nucleosides, and amino acid residues and elucidated the chemical structures of the reaction products. The study provides detailed knowledge on the chemistry of β-propiolactone inactivation of viruses."

https://openalex.org/W2099059244,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The most common mutation, ΔF508, causes retention of CFTR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Some CF abnormalities can be explained by altered Ca(2+) homeostasis, although it remains unknown how CFTR influences calcium signaling. This study examined the novel hypothesis that store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) through Orai1 is abnormal in CF. The significance of Orai1-mediated SOCE for increased interleukin-8 (IL-8) expression in CF was also investigated. CF and non-CF human airway epithelial cell line and primary cells (obtained at lung transplantation) were used in Ca(2+) imaging, electrophysiology, and fluorescence imaging experiments to explore differences in Orai1 function in CF vs. non-CF cells. Protein expression and localization was assessed by Western blots, cell surface biotinylation, ELISA, and image correlation spectroscopy (ICS). We show here that store-operated Ca(2+) entry (SOCE) is elevated in CF human airway epithelial cells (hAECs; ≈ 1.8- and ≈ 2.5-fold for total Ca(2+)(i) increase and Ca(2+) influx rate, respectively, and ≈ 2-fold increase in the I(CRAC) current) and is caused by increased exocytotic insertion (≈ 2-fold) of Orai1 channels into the plasma membrane, which is normalized by rescue of ΔF508-CFTR trafficking to the cell surface. Augmented SOCE in CF cells is a major factor leading to increased IL-8 secretion (≈ 2-fold). CFTR normally down-regulates the Orai1/stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) complex, and loss of this inhibition due to the absence of CFTR at the plasma membrane helps to explain the potentiated inflammatory response in CF cells."

Here, we have demonstrated that activated ERK1/2 interacts with phosphorylated CAR to repress dephosphorylation of Thr-38. The phosphorylation-dependent interaction between CAR and ERK1/2 was examined by co-immunoprecipitation experiments of ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged CAR T38A and CAR T38D mutants with endogenous phospho-ERK1/2 in Huh-7 cells. Phospho-ERK1/2 coprecipitated only the phosphorylation-mimicking CAR T38D mutant; this coprecipitation was mediated by the interaction with the xenochemical response signal peptide near the C terminus of CAR. This interaction increased after EGF treatment and decreased after treatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126 as well as after knockdown of MEK1/2 by shRNA in Huh-7 cells. The phosphorylation levels of Thr-38 of CAR decreased in U0126-treated Huh-7 cells. Thus, activated ERK1/2 interacts with CAR and represses dephosphorylation of Thr-38, providing a cell signal-regulated mechanism for CAR activation."
https://openalex.org/W2115891825,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in permanent loss of motor functions. A significant aspect of the tissue damage and functional loss may be prevenTABLE as it occurs, secondary to the trauma. We show that the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) superfamily plays important roles in SCI. PLA2 enzymes hydrolyze membrane glycerophospholipids to yield a free fatty acid and lysophospholipid. Some free fatty acids (arachidonic acid) give rise to eicosanoids that promote inflammation, while some lysophospholipids (lysophosphatidylcholine) cause demyelination. We show in a mouse model of SCI that two cytosolic forms [calcium-dependent PLA2 group IVA (cPLA2 GIVA) and calcium-independent PLA2 group VIA (iPLA2 GVIA)], and a secreted form [secreted PLA2 group IIA (sPLA2 GIIA)] are up-regulated. Using selective inhibitors and null mice, we show that these PLA2s play differing roles. cPLA2 GIVA mediates protection, whereas sPLA2 GIIA and, to a lesser extent, iPLA2 GVIA are detrimental. Furthermore, completely blocking all three PLA2s worsens outcome, while the most beneficial effects are seen by partial inhibition of all three. The partial inhibitor enhances expression of cPLA2 and mediates its beneficial effects via the prostaglandin EP1 receptor. These findings indicate that drugs that inhibit detrimental forms of PLA2 (sPLA2 and iPLA2) and upregulate the protective form (cPLA2) may be useful for the treatment of SCI.—López-Vales, R., Ghasemlou, N., Redensek, A., Kerr, B.

IntroductionEukaryotic tissues respond to signals in their extracellular environment via the induction of intracellular signaling cascades that induce long term phenotypic changes by inducing a genomic response. One example is found within the airway mucosa, where sentinel epithelial cells activate the innate inflammatory response upon stimulation with macrophage-derived cytokines (1Knight D.A. Holgate S.T.

NF-κB is a transcription factor that regulates genes important for pathogen recognition, cytokine-induced inflammation, immune response, and antiapoptotic signaling pathways (2Tian B. Brasier A.R. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2003; 58: 95-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). As a result, the cytokine-stimulated mucosal surface assumes a pathogen-resistant and proinflammatory phenotype.The canonical NF-κB pathway controls the coupled nuclear translocation-transactivation of the potent transactivating 65-kDa NF-κB/RelA subunit (3Brasier A.R.

In resting cells, NF-κB/RelA is sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactivated state by association with the IκB inhibitors, a family of ankyrin repeat-containing proteins that include IκBα, IκBβ, IκBγ, NF-κB1/p100, and NF-κB2/p105 (5Mercurio F.

A separate kinase complex of IKKα phosphorylates NF-κB1/p100 and NF-κB2/p105 in serine residues in their COOH termini, producing selective degradation of their COOH termini, releasing mature p50/p52 DNA-binding monomers complexed with RelA. The process of selective liberation from sequestered cytoplasmic reservoirs unmasks a nuclear localization domain, allowing NF-κB/RelA translocation into the nucleus, where it binds to κB motifs present in gene promoters, thereby regulating transcription of its downstream network (11Tian B.

NF-κB controls a core component of early response genes, important in cellular intercommunication controlling innate immunity and anti-apoptosis. In addition, it was observed that NF-κB also potently activates expression of IκBα and TNFAIP3/A20, two proteins mediating discrete steps of the negative feedback regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. IκBα expression recaptures NF-κB/RelA back into the cytoplasm, regenerating the cytoplasmic IκBα pool (14Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C.

Thus, NF-κB regulates multiple inhibitory feedback loops that ensure only transient activation of inflammation (17Brasier A.R. Brasier A.R. Garcia-Sastre A. Lemon S.M. Cellular Signaling and Innate Immune Responses to RNA Virus Infections. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) models have been developed using population-derived data to examine the specific functional roles of IκBα, -β, and -ϵ isoforms in regulating the temporal control of NF-κB (18Hoffmann A. Levchenko A. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Science. 2002; 298: 1241-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar) and the role of the NF-κB-TNFAIP3/A20 feedback loop (19Lipniacki T. Paszek P.

These have supplemented population-based experiments to indicate that the dynamic behavior of NF-κB nuclear translocation can vary significantly between cells. In response to tonic TNFα stimulation, an initial synchronous pulse of NF-κB translocation is followed either by nuclear persistence (monophasic activation) or in a minority of cells by dampened oscillatory profiles (22Nelson D.E. Ihekwaba A.E. Elliott M. Johnson J.R. Gibney C.A. Foreman B.E. Nelson G. See V. Horton C.A. Spiller D.G. Edwards S.W. McDowell H.P. Unitt J.F. Sullivan E. Grimley R. Benson N. Broomhead D. Kell D.B.

Individual cells producing asynchronous oscillatory responses produce population robustness, a phenomenon that is predicted to reduce tissue sensitivity to paracrine stimuli (26Paszek P. Ryan S. Ashall L. Sillitoe K. Harper C.V. Spiller D.G. Rand D.A. White M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11644-11649Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Inspection of the dynamic imaging studies indicates that cell populations exhibit heterogeneity in the kinetics of the initial NF-κB response profile. The sources producing cell-to-cell variation are largely unknown. Sensitivity analysis in simulations has indicated that cellular geometry, represented by the ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear volume, a parameter termed kv, has a significant influence on the initial spike of NF-κB because these molecules translocate into the nucleus. Using a clustering approach on trajectory simulations sampled over the parameter space, six different dynamic types of NF-κB translocation behavior were identified (27Joo J. Plimpton S. Martin S. Swiler L. Faulon J.L. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1115: 221-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the experimental measurement of cellular geometry in single cell measurements has not yet been accomplished. Others have proposed stochastic responses at the level of gene expression, although these responses largely influence the oscillatory modes (28Lipniacki T. Paszek P. Brasier A.R. Luxon B.A. Kimmel M. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 725-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Tay S. Hughey J.J. Lee T.K. Lipniacki T. Quake S.R. Covert M.W. Nature. 2010; 466: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar).Despite theoretical advances in NF-κB pathway modeling, individual reaction rates and initial parameters are underdetermined. To extend our understanding of the pathway, we examined dynamic regulation of the NF-κB pathway in an experimentally validated model of airway epithelial cells stably expressing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged NF-κB/RelA molecule. Quantitative measurements of NF-κB translocation surprisingly indicate that only a small fraction (<20%) of cytoplasmic RelA is translocation-competent, being distributed in IκBα, -β, and -ϵ isoform-containing complexes. Single cell dynamic imaging revealed that RelA translocation dynamic was monophasic in these cells. Cellular geometry was experimentally measured using axial sectioning. Incorporation of the cellular geometry and fractional NF-κB translocation into the priors for the Bayesian inference (30Sivia D. Bayesian Analysis: A Tutorial. Oxford Science Publications, Oxford1996Google Scholar) aided the determination of joint probability distribution for the relevant parameters in the translocation model. Our analysis suggests a subpopulation of cells with significantly faster NF-κB decay profiles due to differences in the IκBα translation and degradation dynamics.DISCUSSIONDespite the theoretical treatment of the NF-κB signaling pathway, there are few data available for a rigorous inference of the model parameters or to account for major sources of cellular variability in NF-κB pathway dynamics. In this study, we applied a modified model of the canonical NF-κB pathway that accounts for a distinct subpopulation of translocation-competent NF-κB. We applied Bayesian inference to estimate important parameters using time-resolved NF-κB translocation measurements at a single cell level. Bayesian inference is well suited for this approach, being able to tolerate large noise levels and to provide a joint probability distribution for correlated parameters. Experimental measurements of cytoplasmic and nuclear volumes and fractional NF-κB translocation were used to inform the prior distribution of the cellular geometry parameter kv and the translocation-competent NF-κB·IκBα complex. This Bayesian inference allowed a better understanding of the single cell dynamics and insight into the major sources of cellular variability in NF-κB signaling.There are several new insights generated from our study. First, we note that the total abundance of RelA varies considerably from cell to cell, a finding that may contribute to significant cell-to-cell variation in the activity profile of the pathway. This is observed both in our stable EGFP-RelA transfectants and for endogenous RelA in non-transfected cells, indicating external random effects on the NF-κB pathway in each cell. This point is important because models produced based on population-averaged experimental data will not accurately capture the variation of individual cellular responses.Another significant finding from this study is that a large proportion of cytoplasmic NF-κB is not induced by a saturating concentration of TNFα to translocate into the nucleus. This result is quite surprising because TNFα is one of the most potent NF-κB activators currently known (25Tian B. Zhang Y. Luxon B.A. Garofalo R.P. Casola A. Sinha M. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 6800-6814Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We provide data that indicate the inactive complex is due to association with the NF-κB1 and -2 precursors, cytoplasmic ankryin repeat-containing proteins that sequester a greater molar amount of RelA than that associated with individual IκB isoforms. As a result of these experimental measurements, we modified the deterministic model to include two forms of NF-κB: one as an inactive reservoir in the cytoplasm and the second as a translocation-competent reservoir as an IκBα·NF-κB complex. Our inclusion of NF-κB reservoir in the model resulted in dramatically better fitting of the model with experimental single cell data. More work will be required to understand how the reservoir exchanges with the translocation-competent IκBα·NF-κB pool and how stimuli that induce NF-κB1/2 processing affect the dynamics of the pathway.Although it has been generally assumed that the cellular geometry affects the dynamic NF-κB response, this critical parameter has been assumed in previous modeling studies. kv determines the concentration of nuclear NF-κB as it undergoes nuclear import, with the initial NF-κB concentration determining the kinetics of activation of the negative feedback loops. Our experimental measurements indicate that kv in A549 cells is distributed between 2 and 3, values that are lower than previous modeling assumptions. Also, kv does not dramatically change as a result of pathway activation.Bayesian inference was then applied to this refined NF-κB signaling pathway to estimate parameters using the single cell imaging profiles. The choice of the six inferred parameters in the Bayesian methodology was dictated by a global sensitivity analysis of all 30 input parameters around the nominal values. It is important to note that the inferred concentrations of active NF-κB (i.e. in the form of the IκBα·NF-κB complex) are generally about half the concentration used in previous models. Incorporating prior measurement data on kv and the total NF-κB concentrations in the inference helped to constrain the inferred parameters to biologically realistic values and made the inference process better conditioned overall. The probabilistic nature of the Bayesian inference allowed us to develop the model on a single cell basis and assess the uncertainty in the inferred parameters.Using inferred values of kv and the total NF-κB concentration (Tc) for all 20 studied cells, we estimated the fraction of reservoir inactive NF-κB concentration in these single cells. Fig. 9 clearly shows a high fraction of reservoir NF-κB in all cells as well as considerable cell-to-cell variability in this quantity. This may be one of the major sources of cell-to-cell variability because different cells have different amounts of total NF-κB and different fractions of initial active NF-κB, affecting the dynamics of NF-κB translocation and the downstream signaling initiation process.Although the analysis above suggests several crucial parameters influencing NF-κB translocation dynamics that exhibit cell-to-cell variability, those parameters were not sufficient to capture the cell-to-cell variability observed in the present data set. A Bayesian inference of a single ODE model against data from all 20 cells simultaneously, assuming the rate constants are shared between all of the cells, whereas initial and geometric properties of the cells are cell-specific, was unable to fit all cells. This multicell analysis clearly suggested the existence of two subpopulations of cells; four cells showed much faster decay in the nuclear/total NF-κB ratio dynamics than the rest of the cells. Separate multicell inference runs for these two subpopulations resulted in much improved model fits with the experimental data for all cells. With all other parameters statistically similar for the cells in both subpopulations, both c4a and c6a were significantly larger for the cells in the fast decay subpopulation than in the slow decay subpopulation.The observed subpopulations therefore point at another mechanism of cell-to-cell variability. Besides the unlikely possibility that there are two distinct cellular subpopulations with very different NF-κB·IκBα degradation and IκBα translation rates, another hypothesis is that other factors may drive cells into either a slow or a fast decay mode. One possibility is that other parameters coupled to IκBα degradation or resynthesis rates are under stochastic expression behavior (28Lipniacki T. Paszek P. Brasier A.R. Luxon B.A. Kimmel M. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 725-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), a feature not captured in the current ODE model. For example, stochastic influences may affect IκBα mRNA generation and consequently change the dynamics of the IκBα negative feedback loop, leading to cell-to-cell variability in the NF-κB translocation dynamics in a pool of otherwise identical cells. Alternatively, other parameters may need to be inferred, or the current ODE model may need to be modified to capture missing dynamics in the IκBα degradation. More focused experimentation, outside of the scope of the present study, will be required to identify and understand the source of the pathway deviation in the observed subpopulations.In summary, this study reported and validated novel experimental observations indicating both active and inactive NF-κB in cells. The study also performed a novel Bayesian inference of ODE model parameters against single live cell translocation data, using data from experimentally measured cellular compartment volumes and NF-κB concentrations as prior information. We observed cell-to-cell differences in inferred values of compartment volumes, initial concentrations of NF-κB, and the translation rate of IκBα along with the rate of degradation of IκBα from the NF-κB·IκBα complex. All of these factors influence the overall NF-κB dynamics of cells and are sources of cell-to-cell variability in the observed NF-κB translocation dynamics.

Activated IKKβ phosphorylates IκBα/β/ϵ on serine residues in their NH2-terminal regulatory domains, producing their selective degradation by the 26 S proteasome (9Spencer E. Jiang J. Chen Z.J.

A separate kinase complex of IKKα phosphorylates NF-κB1/p100 and NF-κB2/p105 in serine residues in their COOH termini, producing selective degradation of their COOH termini, releasing mature p50/p52 DNA-binding monomers complexed with RelA. The process of selective liberation from sequestered cytoplasmic reservoirs unmasks a nuclear localization domain, allowing NF-κB/RelA translocation into the nucleus, where it binds to κB motifs present in gene promoters, thereby regulating transcription of its downstream network (11Tian B.

NF-κB controls a core component of early response genes, important in cellular intercommunication controlling innate immunity and anti-apoptosis. In addition, it was observed that NF-κB also potently activates expression of IκBα and TNFAIP3/A20, two proteins mediating discrete steps of the negative feedback regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. IκBα expression recaptures NF-κB/RelA back into the cytoplasm, regenerating the cytoplasmic IκBα pool (14Sun S.C. Ganchi P.A. Ballard D.W. Greene W.C.

Thus, NF-κB regulates multiple inhibitory feedback loops that ensure only transient activation of inflammation (17Brasier A.R. Brasier A.R. Garcia-Sastre A. Lemon S.M. Cellular Signaling and Innate Immune Responses to RNA Virus Infections. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D.

Deterministic ordinary differential equation (ODE) models have been developed using population-derived data to examine the specific functional roles of IκBα, -β, and -ϵ isoforms in regulating the temporal control of NF-κB (18Hoffmann A.

These have supplemented population-based experiments to indicate that the dynamic behavior of NF-κB nuclear translocation can vary significantly between cells. In response to tonic TNFα stimulation, an initial synchronous pulse of NF-κB translocation is followed either by nuclear persistence (monophasic activation) or in a minority of cells by dampened oscillatory profiles (22Nelson D.E. Ihekwaba A.E. Elliott M. Johnson J.R. Gibney C.A. Foreman B.E. Nelson G. See V. Horton C.A. Spiller D.G. Edwards S.W. McDowell H.P. Unitt J.F. Sullivan E. Grimley R. Benson N. Broomhead D. Kell D.B.

Individual cells producing asynchronous oscillatory responses produce population robustness, a phenomenon that is predicted to reduce tissue sensitivity to paracrine stimuli (26Paszek P. Ryan S. Ashall L. Sillitoe K. Harper C.V. Spiller D.G. Rand D.A. White M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 11644-11649Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar).Inspection of the dynamic imaging studies indicates that cell populations exhibit heterogeneity in the kinetics of the initial NF-κB response profile. The sources producing cell-to-cell variation are largely unknown. Sensitivity analysis in simulations has indicated that cellular geometry, represented by the ratio of cytoplasmic to nuclear volume, a parameter termed kv, has a significant influence on the initial spike of NF-κB because these molecules translocate into the nucleus. Using a clustering approach on trajectory simulations sampled over the parameter space, six different dynamic types of NF-κB translocation behavior were identified (27Joo J. Plimpton S. Martin S. Swiler L. Faulon J.L. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2007; 1115: 221-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the experimental measurement of cellular geometry in single cell measurements has not yet been accomplished. Others have proposed stochastic responses at the level of gene expression, although these responses largely influence the oscillatory modes (28Lipniacki T. Paszek P. Brasier A.R. Luxon B.A. Kimmel M. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 725-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Tay S. Hughey J.J. Lee T.K. Lipniacki T. Quake S.R. Covert M.W. Nature. 2010; 466: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar).Despite theoretical advances in NF-κB pathway modeling, individual reaction rates and initial parameters are underdetermined. To extend our understanding of the pathway, we examined dynamic regulation of the NF-κB pathway in an experimentally validated model of airway epithelial cells stably expressing an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged NF-κB/RelA molecule. Quantitative measurements of NF-κB translocation surprisingly indicate that only a small fraction (<20%) of cytoplasmic RelA is translocation-competent, being distributed in IκBα, -β, and -ϵ isoform-containing complexes. Single cell dynamic imaging revealed that RelA translocation dynamic was monophasic in these cells. Cellular geometry was experimentally measured using axial sectioning. Incorporation of the cellular geometry and fractional NF-κB translocation into the priors for the Bayesian inference (30Sivia D. Bayesian Analysis: A Tutorial. Oxford Science Publications, Oxford1996Google Scholar) aided the determination of joint probability distribution for the relevant parameters in the translocation model. Our analysis suggests a subpopulation of cells with significantly faster NF-κB decay profiles due to differences in the IκBα translation and degradation dynamics."

The simulations are not only validated by the agreement with the experimental trends in cAMP-binding domain dynamics determined by NMR, but they also reveal unanticipated dynamic attributes, rationalizing previously unexplained aspects of EPAC activation and autoinhibition. Specifically, the simulations show that cAMP binding causes an extensive perturbation of dynamics in the distal catalytic region, assisting the recognition of the Rap1b substrate. In addition, analysis of the activation intermediates points to a possible hybrid mechanism of EPAC allostery incorporating elements of both the induced fit and conformational selection models. In this mechanism an entropy compensation strategy results in a low free-energy pathway of activation. Furthermore, the simulations indicate that the autoinhibitory interactions of EPAC are more dynamic than previously anticipated, leading to a revised model of autoinhibition in which dynamics fine tune the stability of the autoinhibited state, optimally sensitizing it to cAMP while avoiding constitutive activation.

The structures of EPAC solved in the absence and presence of a nonhydrolysable agonist closely related to cAMP have shown that EPAC adopts two main conformations, which differ with respect to the relative RR/CR orientation (Fig. 1b) (14Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Rehmann H. Arias-Palomo E. Hadders M.A. Schwede F. Llorca O. Bos J.L. Nature. 2008; 455: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the so-called “closed” conformation the RR is in the vicinity of the catalytic domain, blocking access to the Rap1b substrate and effectively inhibiting the guanine nucleotide exchange activity (14Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In the so-called “open” conformation a hinge helix rotation displaces the RR away from the CR, making the catalytic site accessible to the substrate and leading to activation (Fig. 1b) (15Rehmann H. Arias-Palomo E. Hadders M.A. Schwede F. Llorca O. Bos J.L. Nature. 2008; 455: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In the absence of cAMP, EPAC populates mainly the closed inactive conformation, which is stabilized by two key sets of interactions commonly referred to as the hydrophobic hinge (HH) and ionic latch (IL) (14Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Rehmann H. Arias-Palomo E. Hadders M.A. Schwede F. Llorca O. Bos J.L.

The HH involves the phosphate binding cassette (PBC), which has been proposed to sterically block conformational changes in the hinge helix, maintaining this helix in its inactive conformation (supplemental Fig. S1). Specifically, it has been hypothesized that the inactive conformation is stabilized by steric hindrance between a leucine side chain from the PBC (Leu408 in EPAC2) and a phenylalanine side chain from the hinge (Phe435 in EPAC2) (14Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 16Harper S.M. Wienk H. Wechselberger R.W. Bos J.L. Boelens R. Rehmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6501-6508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The IL involves the CNB and CDC25-HD domains, which interact through a series of key salt bridges between an N-terminal helical bundle (NTHB) in the CNB domain and the catalytic site of the CDC25-HD domain (14Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In particular, these IL interactions involve the side chains of a glutamine (Gln303 in EPAC2) and aspartate (Asp307 in EPAC2) residue from the DEP-CNB connecting helix (“α1” of the NTHB), a glutamate residue (Glu332 in EPAC2) from the second NTHB helix (“α2”), and an aspartate (Asp883 in EPAC2) and arginine (Arg886 in EPAC2) residue from the CDC25-HD domain catalytic site (Fig. 1b) (14Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). When cAMP binds to the CNB domain, a number of changes occur that perturb the HH and IL autoinhibitory interactions and allow EPAC to adopt its active conformation. First, the interaction of the bound cAMP with the PBC repositions Leu408, relieving the steric hindrance between the PBC and the hinge helix and allowing the activation-associated hinge rotation to proceed (15Rehmann H. Arias-Palomo E. Hadders M.A. Schwede F. Llorca O. Bos J.L. Nature. 2008; 455: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Harper S.M. Wienk H. Wechselberger R.W. Bos J.L. Boelens R. Rehmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6501-6508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The second major change induced by cAMP binding is a breaking of the ionic latch interactions between the NTHB of the CNB domain and the catalytic site of the CDC25-HD, assisting the displacement of the EPAC regulatory region away from the CDC25-HD via the hinge rotation (14Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 2006; 439: 625-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 15Rehmann H. Arias-Palomo E. Hadders M.A. Schwede F. Llorca O. Bos J.L. Nature. 2008; 455: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Notably, NMR relaxation experiments have shown that upon cAMP binding, an enhancement of conformational dynamics occurs in the NTHB, including the second and third residues involved in the ionic latch (Asp307 and Glu332 in EPAC2), whereas no major structural changes appeared to occur in the helices that span the ionic latch (i.e. α1 and α2) (18Das R.

Therefore, cAMP binding triggers an increase in conformational entropy of the ionic latch region, thereby increasing the entropic penalty for preserving the ionic latch, and consequently weakening the ionic latch-mediated interactions between the CNB and CDC25-HD domains (18Das R. Mazhab-Jafari M.T. Chowdhury S. SilDas S. Selvaratnam R. Melacini G. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 19691-19703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Besides causing the HH rearrangement and IL weakening, cAMP forms through its adenine additional interactions with the base binding region (BBR) of the CNB and the so-called lid region (supplemental Fig. S1), thereby stabilizing EPAC into its active conformation (15Rehmann H. Arias-Palomo E. Hadders M.A. Schwede F. Llorca O. Bos J.L. Nature. 2008; 455: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 16Harper S.M. Wienk H. Wechselberger R.W. Bos J.L. Boelens R. Rehmann H. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6501-6508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The active structure of EPAC is further stabilized by intramolecular interactions that are formed among the CNB and REM domains and the lid, including interactions of PBC residue Lys405 with lid residues Glu443, Asn445, and Tyr480, and interactions of CNB residues Gln369 and Tyr389 with REM residue Tyr551 (15Rehmann H. Arias-Palomo E. Hadders M.A. Schwede F. Llorca O. Bos J.L. Nature. 2008; 455: 124-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Overall, it is clear that the experimental characterizations of the apo/inactive and holo/active states of EPAC have unveiled key attributes of the mechanisms of EPAC autoinhibition and cAMP-dependent activation (14Rehmann H.

Without a full map of the dynamic profile of EPAC, key aspects of EPAC function remain unexplained. Another limitation of the current experimental investigations on EPAC is that they are to a large extent limited to the apo/inactive and holo/active states due to the effective coupling between cAMP binding and the closed-to-open conformational transition. As a result, no information is currently available on the apo/active and holo/inactive cross-states (“metastates”), which represent key intermediates in the thermodynamic cycle that models the coupling between cAMP binding and allosteric conformational changes (Fig. 1b). Specifically, the apo/active metastate is critical when activation proceeds through conformational selection, whereas the holo/inactive metastate is central when activation proceeds through an induced fit mechanism (26Ma B.

The characterization of the metastates is also essential to dissect the distinct contributions of cAMP binding and conformational changes to the variations in dynamics between the apo-inactive and holo-active states. For the purpose of gaining insight into the dynamics of full-length EPAC in all four states of the thermodynamic cycle of EPAC activation (Fig. 1b), we present here molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (34Grant B.J.

The simulations are in agreement with the available NMR data, but they also reveal several picosecond-nanosecond dynamic features of EPAC allostery that were not anticipated from previous experiments. These features include a dynamic control of critical autoinhibitory interactions as well as an extensive modulation of both RR and CR dynamics by both cAMP and Rap1b binding, pointing to the existence of a long-range dynamic RR/CR cross-talk. In addition, the MD simulations reveal a possible low free-energy pathway for the reversible and cAMP-dependent activation of EPAC through a hybrid induced-fit/conformational selection mechanism. MD simulations in explicit solvent were performed starting from the four states of the thermodynamic cycle for the cAMP-dependent EPAC allostery (Fig. 1b), i.e. the experimentally observable apo/inactive and holo/active states as well as the intermediate holo/inactive and apo/active states (18Das R.

The latter two states are unstable under physiological conditions and thus are referred to herein as metastates to distinguish them from the experimentally observable apo/inactive and holo/active states, for which structures have been solved by x-ray crystallography (14Rehmann H.

All simulations were performed on the EPAC2(280–990) fragment (Fig. 1b). This segment contains the essential regulatory CNB domain and the full catalytic region (i.e. the REM, RA, and CDC25-HD domains) (14Rehmann H. Das J. Knipscheer P. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L.

Here, we report that EGF induces biphasic Rac1 activation in the process of cell migration, and UTKO1, a cell migration inhibitor, inhibits the second EGF-induced wave of Rac1 activation but not the first wave. To address the regulation mechanism and role of the second wave of Rac1 activation, we identified 14-3-3ζ as a target protein of UTKO1 and also showed that UTKO1 abrogated the binding of 14-3-3ζ to Tiam1 that was responsible for the second wave of Rac1 activation, suggesting that the interaction of 14-3-3ζ with Tiam1 is involved in this event. To our knowledge, this is the first report to use a chemical genetic approach to demonstrate the mechanism of temporal activation of Rac1."
https://openalex.org/W1972204840,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is one of the major proteins involved in Alzheimer disease (AD). Proteolytic cleavage of APP gives rise to amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides that aggregate and deposit extensively in the brain of AD patients. Although the increase in levels of aberrantly folded Aβ peptide is considered to be important to disease pathogenesis, the regulation of APP processing and Aβ metabolism is not fully understood. Recently, the British precursor protein (BRI2, ITM2B) has been implicated in influencing APP processing in cells and Aβ deposition in vivo. Here, we show that the wild type BRI2 protein reduces plaque load in an AD mouse model, similar to its disease-associated mutant form, ADan precursor protein (ADanPP), and analyze in more detail the mechanism of how BRI2 and ADanPP influence APP processing and Aβ metabolism. We find that overexpression of either BRI2 or ADanPP reduces extracellular Aβ by increasing levels of secreted insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), a major Aβ-degrading protease. This effect is also observed with BRI2 lacking its C-terminal 23-amino acid peptide sequence. Our results suggest that BRI2 might act as a receptor protein that regulates IDE levels that in turn influences APP metabolism in a previously unrecognized way. Targeting the regulation of IDE may be a promising therapeutic approach to sporadic AD."
https://openalex.org/W2052128154,"Phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/Akt signaling plays a critical role in cell proliferation and survival, partly by regulation of FoxO transcription factors. Previous work using global expression profiling indicated that inhibition of PI 3-kinase in proliferating cells led to induction of genes that promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The upstream regulatory regions of these genes had binding sites not only for FoxO, but also for Myc/Max transcription factors. In the present study, we have addressed the role of Myc family members and related E-box-binding proteins in the regulation of these genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitations and RNA interference indicated that transcription was repressed by Max-Mnt-Sin3a-histone deacetylase complexes in proliferating cells. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase led to a loss of Max/Mnt binding and transcriptional induction by MITF and USF1, as well as FoxO. Both MITF and USF1 were activated by glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3, with GSK3 phosphorylation sites on USF1 identified as the previously described activating site threonine 153 as well as serine 186. siRNA against MITF as well as against FoxO3a protected cells from apoptosis following PI 3-kinase inhibition. These results define a novel E-box-regulated network that functions coordinately with FoxO to regulate transcription of apoptotic and cell cycle regulatory genes downstream of PI 3-kinase/Akt/GSK3 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2052596462,"A subset of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs modulates the γ cleavage site in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) to selectively reduce production of Aβ42. It is unclear precisely how these γ-secretase modulators (GSMs) act to preferentially spare Aβ40 production as well as Notch processing and signaling. In an effort to determine the substrate requirements in NSAID/GSM activity, we determined the effects of sulindac sulfide and flurbiprofen on γ-cleavage of artificial constructs containing several γ-secretase substrates. Using FLAG-tagged constructs that expressed extracellularly truncated APP, Notch-1, or CD44, we found that these substrates have different sensitivities to sulindac sulfide. γ-Secretase cleavage of APP was altered by sulindac sulfide, but CD44 and Notch-1 were either insensitive or only minimally altered by this compound. Using chimeric APP constructs, we observed that the transmembrane domain (TMD) of APP played a pivotal role in determining drug sensitivity. Substituting the APP TMD with that of APLP2 retained the sensitivity to γ-cleavage modulation, but replacing TMDs from Notch-1 or ErbB4 rendered the resultant molecules insensitive to drug treatment. Specifically, the GXXXG motif within APP appeared to be critical to GSM activity. Consequently, the modulatory effects on γ-cleavage appears to be substrate-dependent. We hypothesize that the substrate present in the γ-secretase complex influences the conformation of the complex so that the binding site of GSMs is either stabilized or less favorable to influence the cleavage of the respective substrates.

https://openalex.org/W1983903905,"The Cdc45-Mcm2-7-GINS (CMG) complex is the replication fork helicase in eukaryotes. Synthetic lethal with Dpb11-1 (Sld2) is required for the initiation of DNA replication, and the S phase cyclin-dependent kinase (S-CDK) phosphorylates Sld2 in vivo. We purified components of the replication initiation machinery and studied their interactions in vitro. We found that unphosphorylated or CDK-phosphorylated Sld2 binds to the mini chromosome maintenance (Mcm)2-7 complex with similar efficiency. Sld2 interaction with Mcm2-7 blocks the interaction between GINS and Mcm2-7. The interaction between CDK-phosphorylated Sld2 and Mcm2-7 is substantially inhibited by origin single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Furthermore, origin ssDNA allows GINS to bind to Mcm2-7 in the presence of CDK-phosphorylated Sld2. However, unphosphorylated Sld2 blocks the interaction between GINS and Mcm2-7 even in the presence of origin ssDNA. We identified a mutant of Sld2 that does not bind to DNA. When this mutant is expressed in yeast cells, cell growth is severely inhibited with very slow progression into S phase. We propose a model wherein Sld2 blocks the interaction between GINS and Mcm2-7 in vivo. Once origin ssDNA is extruded from the Mcm2-7 ring and CDK phosphorylates Sld2, the origin ssDNA binds to CDK-phosphorylated Sld2. This event may allow the interaction between GINS and Mcm2-7 in vivo. Thus, CDK phosphorylation of Sld2 may be important to release Sld2 from Mcm2-7, thereby allowing GINS to bind Mcm2-7. Furthermore, origin ssDNA may stimulate the formation of the CMG complex by alleviating inhibitory interactions between Sld2 with Mcm2-7."
https://openalex.org/W2087743724,"Lamellipodium extension is crucial for cell migration and spreading. The rate of lamellipodium extension is determined by the balance between the rate of actin polymerization and the rate of actin retrograde flow. LIM kinase 1 (LIMK1) regulates actin dynamics by phosphorylating and inactivating cofilin, an actin-depolymerizing protein. We examined the role of LIMK1 in lamellipodium extension by measuring the rates of actin polymerization, actin retrograde flow, and lamellipodium extension using time-lapse imaging of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. In the non-extending lamellipodia of active Rac-expressing N1E-115 cells, LIMK1 expression decelerated and LIMK1 knockdown accelerated actin retrograde flow. In the extending lamellipodia of neuregulin-stimulated MCF-7 cells, LIMK1 knockdown accelerated both the rate of actin polymerization and the rate of actin retrograde flow, but the accelerating effect on retrograde flow was greater than the effect on polymerization, thus resulting in a decreased rate of lamellipodium extension. These results indicate that LIMK1 has a dual role in regulating lamellipodium extension by decelerating actin retrograde flow and polymerization, and in MCF-7 cells endogenous LIMK1 contributes to lamellipodium extension by decelerating actin retrograde flow more effectively than decelerating actin polymerization."
https://openalex.org/W2007264834,"The p53 family member, p73, has been characterized as a tumor suppressor and functions in a similar manner as p53 to induce cellular death. The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) can function as a dual specificity lipid/protein phosphatase. However, recent data have described multiple roles for nuclear PTEN independent of its lipid phosphatase activity. PTEN can directly or indirectly activate p53 to promote apoptosis. We examined whether PTEN would interact and regulate p73 independent of p53. Co-localization in the nucleus and complex formation of p73/PTEN were observed after DNA damage. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that p73α/PTEN proteins directly bind one another. Both overexpressed and endogenous p73-PTEN interactions were determined to be the strongest in the nuclear fraction after DNA damage, which suggested formation of a transcriptional complex. We employed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and found that p73 and PTEN were associated with the PUMA promoter after genotoxic stress in TP53-null cells. We found that another p73 target, BAX, had an increased expression in the presence of p73 and PTEN. In addition, in virus-transduced cell lines stably expressing p73, PTEN, or both p73/PTEN, we found that the p73/PTEN cells were more sensitive to genotoxic stress and cellular death as measured by increased poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and PUMA/Bax induction. Conversely, knockdown of PTEN dramatically reduced Bax and PUMA levels. Thus, a p73-PTEN protein complex is engaged to induce apoptosis independent of p53 in response to DNA damage."

Mass spectrometric analysis identified 5-taurinomethyluridine (τm(5)U) at the anticodon wobble positions of tRNA(Met)(AUR), tRNA(Trp)(UGR), and tRNA(Gly)(AGR), suggesting that τm(5)U plays a critical role in the accurate deciphering of all four non-universal codes by preventing the misreading of pyrimidine-ending near-cognate codons (NNY) in their respective family boxes.

It has been suggested that the transition between the CATR and BA conformations is involved in ADP/ATP transport across the mitochondrial inner membrane (1Klingenberg M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 1978-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). ADP/ATP carrier bovine isoform 1 Ancp yeast isoform 2 Ancp carboxyatractyloside atractyloside bongkrekic acid intermembrane space hydroxylapatite isoform one of the yeast mitochondrial porin hydrogen/deuterium exchange electrospray ionization mitochondrial carrier family yeast peptone liver. Ancp belongs to the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF), all members of which share common features, i.e. similar molecular masses of about 30 kDa, a so-called tripartite organization consisting in three sequence repeats of about 100 amino acids, each containing a conserved PX(D/E)XX(K/R) motif (2Walker J.E. Runswick M.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition, all Ancp share a common signature sequence, RRRMMM, that is not found in other MCF members (3Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trézéguet V. Vignais P.V. Lauquin G.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The intrinsic mechanisms of ADP/ATP transport, nucleotide recognition, and Ancp conformational changes have been widely investigated, mainly using bovine isoform 1 (bAnc1p) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae isoform 2 (ScAnc2p) (4Dahout-Gonzalez C. Nury H. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.M. Pebay-Peyroula E. Brandolin G. Physiology. 2006; 21: 242-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Bovine Anc1p crystallized in complex with CATR was the first mitochondrial carrier for which high resolution structural data were obtained (5Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.M. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The 2.2-Å resolution structure of the CATR conformation showed six tilted transmembrane α-helices forming a wide cavity open toward the intermembrane space (IMS) and closed on the matrix side (5Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.M. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The high resolution three-dimensional structure of the bovine carrier in complex with BA, however, has not yet been described. Recently, both complexes were compared in detergent solution by hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). These analyses provided new information on the BA conformation and, thus, on the conformational dynamics of bAnc1p during ADP/ATP transport (6Rey M. Man P. Clémençon B. Trézéguet V. Brandolin G. Forest E. Pelosi L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34981-34990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the bovine model remains limited to biochemical studies of the native form because its overexpression in bacteria or in yeast is difficult (7Trézéguet V. Pélosi L. Lauquin G.J.M. Brandolin G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2008; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast, the yeast carrier, ScAnc2p, has been widely studied by site-directed mutagenesis. It has been suggested that, despite extensive homology and similar activity, bAnc1p and ScAnc2p present some distinct biochemical properties (7Trézéguet V. Pélosi L. Lauquin G.J.M. Brandolin G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2008; 40: 435-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) while sharing similar structural features, i.e. a common two-dimensional structure formed by six transmembrane helices and three large loops. In this study we investigated the conformational dynamics of ScAnc2p by HDX-MS to decipher the role of specific amino acid residues involved in the structural transitions that Ancp undergoes during ADP/ATP transport. The results are discussed with respect to the biochemical data available on ScAnc2p and on Ancp in general. We then focused our studies on the Ancp signature sequence, RRRMMM, specifically on the triplet of methionyl residues. Our results provide new insights into the biochemical role of this motif, which is located at the bottom of the cavity (toward the matrix) and may contribute to the ADP/ATP binding step. After mutation of the first methionyl residue of the triplet, spontaneous intragenic suppressor mutants were identified. These were located at the top of the cavity, indicating that the conserved sequence may also play a role in the structural complementarity between both sides of the cavity formed by the carrier and in the nucleotide translocation process. Taken together, our results indicate that ScAnc2p has a highly dynamic structure, with different protein parts acting in synergy. Moreover, the first and the third methionyl residues within the Ancp signature sequence appear to be crucial for nucleotide transport. BA and [3H]atractyloside ([3H]ATR) were prepared as previously described (8Brandolin G. Meyer C. Defaye G. Vignais P.M. Vignais P.V.

Hydroxylapatite (HTP) was from Bio-Rad. Triton X-100 and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside were purchased from Anatrace. CATR, pepsin, and bovine serum albumin were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant type XVIII protease was prepared as described (10Rey M. Man P. Brandolin G. Forest E. Pelosi L. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2009; 23: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Trifluoroacetic acid, acetonitrile, and dichloromethane were purchased from Sigma, Carlo Erba Reagenti, and Riedel de Haën, respectively. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against yeast SDS-treated VDAC were generously provided by Guy Lauquin (Bordeaux 2 University). The polyclonal ScAnc2p antibodies used were produced in rabbits inoculated with SDS-treated, HTP-purified ScAnc2p. The Escherichia coli strain used in this work was JM109: recA1, endA1, gyrA96, thi, hsdR17 (rK-, mK+), relA1, supE44, Δ(lac-proAB), [F′, traD36, proAB, lacIqZΔM15] (Promega).

Site-directed mutagenesis of ScANC2 was performed using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Roche Applied Science) with the mutagenic primers presented in Table 1. The mutated scanc2 genes were subcloned into a centromeric plasmid, pRS314, under the control of ScANC2 regulatory sequences as described (16Le Saux A. Roux P. Trézéguet V. Fiore C. Schwimmer C.

Open table in a new tab Yeast cells grown on YPL or YNB Gal W− were harvested during the late log phase (A600 nm near 5 in YPL or near 3 in YNB Gal W−). Mitochondria were prepared as previously described (18Dahout-Gonzalez C. Ramus C. Dassa E.P. Dianoux A.C. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16310-16320Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). ADP/ATP transport was measured by a luminescence assay, as detailed in Dassa et al. (19Dassa E.P. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Dianoux A.C. Brandolin G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 40: 358-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly prepared mitochondria were incubated for 5 min at 25 °C in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KH2PO4, 0.6 m mannitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 μm Ap5A (an adenylate kinase inhibitor), and 1 mm α-ketoglutarate in the presence of 0.1% (w/v) luciferin and 0.1% (w/v) luciferase. [3H]ATR binding assays on isolated mitochondria were carried out as described (3Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trézéguet V. Vignais P.V. Lauquin G.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, mitochondria were diluted (0.5–1 mg of protein/ml) in 1 ml of standard medium (0.12 m KCl, 10 mm Mops, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA), and [3H]ATR was added at concentrations up to 3 μm. After incubation for 45 min at 0 °C, mitochondria were sedimented, and radioactivity associated with the pellet was determined by scintillation counting (Ready Value, Beckman). Assays were also performed in the presence of 20 μm CATR to correct for minor nonspecific [3H]ATR binding. ADP/ATP carrier proteins were isolated from yeast mitochondria as a CATR-carrier complex or a BA-carrier complex. ScAnc2p was enriched from JL1–3ANC2 or JL1–3ANC2Δpor1 strains by HTP in the presence of Triton X-100 (1% (w/v) final concentration) according to the described method (3Brandolin G. Le Saux A. Trézéguet V. Vignais P.V. Lauquin G.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). C-terminal histidine-tagged carrier was purified from strain JL1–3ANC2(His6) in the presence of n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (0.05% (w/v) final concentration) according to the described procedure (14Fiore C. Trézéguet V. Roux P. Le Saux A. Noël F. Schwimmer C. Arlot D. Dianoux A.C. Lauquin G.J.M. Brandolin G. Protein Expr. Purif. 2000; 19: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The final carrier protein concentration in each purified fraction ranged between 0.05 and 0.1 mg/ml, depending on the method used. All in-solution protein digestions were performed in an ice bath at 0 °C. Protease solutions were prepared in 20 mm glycine, pH 2.5, and cooled to 0 °C. The Ancp was digested in 20 mm glycine, pH 2.5, for 2 min using a substrate/protease ratio between 1:0.25 and 1:2 (w/w) for pepsin or between 1:1.5 and 1:24 (w/w) for recombinant type XVIII protease. On-line digestion of the ADP/ATP carrier in the presence of 1 m guanidinium chloride was performed in an ice-bath at 0 °C using a column packed with pepsin immobilized on a POROS-20AL resin, as described (10Rey M. Man P. Brandolin G. Forest E. Pelosi L. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2009; 23: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Sigma) with BSA as a standard. For SDS-PAGE, samples were prepared as described (18Dahout-Gonzalez C. Ramus C. Dassa E.P. Dianoux A.C. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 16310-16320Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Antibodies directed against SDS-treated ScAnc2p or yeast SDS-treated VDAC were used at a 1:1500 and 1:1000 final dilution, respectively. Antibody binding was revealed using horseradish peroxidase-coupled protein A and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). The ADP/ATP carrier-inhibitor complexes were purified and concentrated up to 5 mg of protein/ml. The HDX reaction was initiated by diluting protein 10-fold in a 4 °C deuterated buffer containing 10 mm MOPS-NaOH, pH 6.8, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The kinetics of H/D exchange was followed over a 10,000-s period by sequentially withdrawing 80-μl samples. Aliquots were immediately added to 20 μl of quenching buffer (1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.5), rapidly mixed, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. Peptides obtained by on-line protein digestion were loaded onto a Peptide MicroTrap column (Michrom Bioressources). Samples were desalted, and detergent and lipids were removed, as previously described (20Rey M. Mrázek H. Pompach P. Novák P. Pelosi L. Brandolin G. Forest E. Havlícek V. Man P. Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 5107-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Peptides were separated on a reversed phase C18 column (1 × 100 mm, Jupiter; Phenomenex), as previously described (20Rey M. Mrázek H. Pompach P. Novák P. Pelosi L. Brandolin G. Forest E. Havlícek V. Man P. Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 5107-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To minimize back-exchange, the valves, trap column, and analytical column were cooled to 0 °C by immersion in an ice-water bath. Protein mass was measured as follows. 200 pmol of carrier solubilized in 0.05% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside were loaded onto a Protein MicroTrap column (Michrom Bioressources). The sample was desalted for 1 min with 200 μl of water. Protein and detergent were then eluted onto a C8 RP-column (1 × 100 mm, Jupiter, Phenomenex) for separation. Liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC ESI-MS/MS) analyses were performed on an ion trap mass spectrometer (Esquire 3000+, Bruker Daltonics). The HPLC system was connected directly to the spectrometer's ESI source through a T-piece splitting device. The settings used were as previously described (20Rey M. Mrázek H. Pompach P. Novák P. Pelosi L. Brandolin G. Forest E. Havlícek V. Man P. Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 5107-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Data were processed using DataAnalysis 3.0 (Bruker), and MASCOT was used to match MS/MS spectra to a single-protein data base containing the ScAnc2p sequence. A liquid chromatography electrospray time-of-flight MS (LC ESI-ToF-MS) 6210 system (Agilent Technologies) was used to analyze deuterated samples and for accurate mass measurements. Isotope envelopes were extracted using Mass Hunter Qualitative Analyses software (Agilent Technologies), and the centroid of the isotopic distribution was measured using MagTran software (Zhongqi Zhang, Amgen, Thousand Oaks, CA) (21Zhang Z. Marshall A.G. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1998; 9: 225-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Carrier mapping was represented using DrawMap (MS Tools (36Kavan D. Man P. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2011; 302: 53-58Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar)). The exact number of amino acids and whether any post-translational modifications are present on the mature ScAnc2p have not yet been determined. LC ESI-ToF-MS was used to determine the accurate molecular weight of ScAnc2p according to the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” HTP-purified ScAnc2p preparations contain several contaminant proteins, in particular mitochondrial porin isoform one (VDAC1) and large amounts of ergosterol and detergent (22Knirsch M. Gawaz M.P. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 244: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We, therefore, purified a modified form of the yeast carrier to which a six-histidine extension had been added at the C terminus (ScAnc2p-His6). This allowed contaminants to be eliminated and decreased the amount of detergent present in the final purified protein solution, thus facilitating MS analysis. From the deconvoluted mass spectrum, purified ScAnc2p-His6 exhibits a molecular mass of 35,549 Da (Fig. 1A), which is in agreement with the calculated mass of 35,547 Da for ScAnc2p-His6, where the N-terminal methionyl residue has been removed and the new N-terminal residue acetylated, as previously suggested (23Dianoux A.C. Noël F. Fiore C. Trézéguet V. Kieffer S. Jaquinod M. Lauquin G.J.M. Brandolin G. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11477-11487Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). As stated above, ScAnc2p, purified by a single chromatographic step on HTP, contained VDAC1 as a major contaminant (Fig. 1B, lane 1). For structural and conformational analyses, a highly purified, unmodified ScAnc2p (without His6 tag) form is necessary. To produce this, we used the JL1–3ANC2Δpor1 strain in which the genes encoding VDAC1 and Ancp isoforms 1 and 3 (ScANC1 and ScANC3) were disrupted (see “Experimental Procedures”). ScAnc2p in complex with CATR or BA was isolated in Triton X-100 from this yeast strain as a pure protein (Fig. 1B, lane 2). The detergent used is relevant for further HDX-MS studies, as shown in Rey et al. (20Rey M. Mrázek H. Pompach P. Novák P. Pelosi L. Brandolin G. Forest E. Havlícek V. Man P. Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 5107-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Two different acidic proteases were tested for in-solution digestion of ScAnc2p as a CATR complex. The corresponding lysates were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies raised against SDS-treated ScAnc2p (Fig. 1C). Proteases were used at an enzyme/ScAnc2p ratio (w/w) of between 0.25 and 2 for commercial pepsin and between 1.5 and 24 for the home-produced recombinant type XVIII protease (10Rey M. Man P. Brandolin G. Forest E. Pelosi L. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2009; 23: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The results clearly showed pepsin to be more efficient for ScAnc2p digestion, as no residual fragment was immunodetected from an enzyme/ScAnc2p ratio (w/w) of 1 (Fig. 1C). Type XVIII protease was also able to almost completely digest ScAnc2p, although only at an enzyme/ScAnc2p ratio (w/w) of 24. Similar results were obtained with the BA-carrier complex (not shown). Because of its more efficient digestion of ScAnc2p, pepsin was used in subsequent experiments. Our previous studies of soluble and membrane-bound proteins showed immobilized proteases to offer several advantages in HDX-MS experiments (6Rey M. Man P. Clémençon B. Trézéguet V. Brandolin G. Forest E. Pelosi L. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 34981-34990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Rey M. Man P. Brandolin G. Forest E. Pelosi L. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2009; 23: 3431-3438Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 20Rey M. Mrázek H. Pompach P. Novák P. Pelosi L. Brandolin G. Forest E. Havlícek V. Man P. Anal. Chem. 2010; 82: 5107-5116Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition to higher protease stability and the absence of auto-digestion, immobilized proteases provide a much higher local protein concentration. This leads to a better digestion efficiency and makes it possible to use chaotropic reagents such as guanidinium chloride. Thus, for fast, efficient, and highly reproducible digestion of ScAnc2p in complex with CATR or BA, we performed on-line proteolysis using a column packed with immobilized pepsin. ScAnc2p as a CATR- or BA-carrier complex was digested as described above. Lysates were analyzed by LC ESI-MS/MS. The MS/MS spectra allowed identification of 55 peptides, homogeneously covering 76% of the protein sequence (data not shown). Only the N-terminal region of ScAnc2p was not covered by any peptides. This is probably due to the presence of numerous prolyl residues that hamper carrier digestion. In contrast, in HDX-MS experiments, protein coverage fell to 51% (20 peptides). This was due to a combination of low signal-to-noise ratio and overlapping signals (Fig. 2). Because of this, helices H3, H5, and H6 could only be analyzed based on one peptide per region. We, therefore, attempted to improve protein coverage by adapting our digestion process. Combinations of pepsin and type XVIII protease were tested for in-solution digestion of deuterated proteins, but no improvement in coverage was noted (data not shown). Similarly, a column packed with immobilized recombinant type XVIII protease did not improve protein coverage in HDX-MS experiments (data not shown). The conformational dynamics of Triton X-100- extracted ScAnc2p were investigated by HDX-MS. To monitor local HDX kinetics for individual parts of ScAnc2p in complex with CATR or BA, the protein was digested after between 10 and 10,000 s of incubation in a deuterium-containing buffer. Results for each peptide region are presented in Fig. 2. All the regions analyzed exhibited inhibitor-sensitive deuterium accessibility. Moreover, deuteration was always higher and/or faster for the ScAnc2p-BA complex than for the ScAnc2p-CATR complex (Fig. 2), suggesting that overall and throughout the protein sequence, the amidic protons of the BA conformer were more exchangeable with deuterium than those of the CATR conformer. For both complexes analyzed, deuteration data recorded at the end of the experiment are presented in Fig. 3. In the three-dimensional structure of bovine Anc1p, loops m1 to m3 are positioned parallel to the membrane surface, where they appear to strengthen the carrier closed conformation on the matrix side when bound to CATR (5Pebay-Peyroula E. Dahout-Gonzalez C. Kahn R. Trézéguet V. Lauquin G.J.M. Brandolin G. Nature. 2003; 426: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). In our studies of ScAnc2p, loop m1 was covered mainly by regions 64–70 and 74–85, loop m2 by regions 156–172 and 177–188, and loop m3 by regions 258–268 and 278–283 (Fig. 2). When complexed to CATR, the amide protons of loops m1 and m3 were generally more readily exchangeable with deuterium than those of loop m2 (Fig. 2). Region 258–268, located within loop m3, was the most extensively deuterated (81% of HDX at the end of the experiment). In contrast, region 177–188, from loop m2, was the most protected from deuteration (27% of HDX at the end of the experiment). In the BA-carrier complex, amidic protons of the matrix loops exhibited a greater level of deuterium exchange than in the CATR-carrier complex (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Interestingly, regions 64–70, 156–172, and 258–268 (located mainly at the N-terminal coil of matrix helices) were deuterated faster in the BA-carrier complex than in the CATR-carrier complex (17, 25, and 27% of HDX in presence of CATR versus 41, 38, and 76% of HDX in the presence of BA, respectively, after 10 s of incubation). However, the level of deuteration recorded at the end of the experiment was inhibitor-insensitive (52 versus 51, 36 versus 38, and 81 versus 80% of HDX, respectively) (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). In contrast, regions 74–85, 177–188, and 278–283, which encompass a large part of the C-terminal coil of the matrix helices, did not behave in the same way. These regions were more rapidly and extensively deuterated in the presence of BA at the end of the experiment (42, 27, and 53% of HDX in presence of CATR versus 59, 45, and 63% of HDX in the presence of BA) (FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Overall, these results were consistent with better exposure of the matrix loops to the solvent in the BA conformer than in the CATR conformer. This behavior may indicate that the carrier opens toward the matrix,"

It has been difficult to demonstrate the function of heterologously expressed nAChR containing α6 and α5 subunits. Recently Broadbent et al. (17Broadbent S. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Krashia P.A. Harkness P.C. Millar N.S. Beato M. Sivilotti L.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2006; 70: 1350-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and we (18Dash, B., Bhakta, M., Chang, Y., Lukas, R. J. (August 10, 2011) J. Biol. Chem. DOI 10.1074/jbc.M111.263673.Google Scholar) observed that incorporation of the human (h) nAChR β3 (hβ3) subunit has a dominant-negative effect on the function of some heterologously expressed nAChR subtypes. By contrast, coexpression with hβ3 subunits having a “reporter” mutation (valine 273 to serine at the M2 second transmembrane domain 9′ position, hβ3V273S = hβ3V9′S) has a “gain-of-function” effect, potentiating the function of hα6hβ2- or hα6hβ4-nAChR (17Broadbent S. Groot-Kormelink P.J. Krashia P.A. Harkness P.C. Millar N.S. Beato M. Sivilotti L.G. Mol.

Building on these findings, we hypothesized that hα5 subunits may also exert a dominant-negative effect on hα6hβ2- and hα6hβ4-nAChR function, in part because α5 and β3 subunits are phylogenetically similar, highly homologous, and share service as accessory subunits in several nAChR subtypes. Acutely aware that coexpression with mutated hα5 subunits (M2 second transmembrane domain 9′ position, hα5V290S = hα5V9′S) do not induce spontaneous opening or increased agonist sensitivity of the nAChR subtypes tested (19Groot-Kormelink P.J. Boorman J.P. Sivilotti L.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) we further hypothesized that recombinant, chimeric hα5/hβ3V273S subunits (in which the N-terminal, large extracellular domain of the hα5 subunit is linked to the remaining domains of the gain-of-function hβ3V9′S subunit) would serve as a reporter mutation and, upon integration into α6*-nAChR, would increase their agonist sensitivity. Here we report findings using a variety of wild-type, reporter mutant, or chimeric nAChR subunits, hybrid nAChR containing subunits from different species, and the oocyte expression system. We provide evidence that wild-type α5 or reporter mutant hα5V9′S subunits are incorporated into complexes also containing either hα6 or mα6 plus either hβ2 or hβ4 subunits, but have a null or dominant-negative effect on the function of those α6*-nAChR. We also show that chimeric hα5/hβ3 subunits have similar effects, but that reporter mutant chimeric hα5/hβ3V9′S subunits allow for agonist-activated and some spontaneous function of hα6hβ4*- or mα6hβ4*-nAChR. Moreover, we demonstrate that chimeric hα6/hα3 subunits (10Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Choi C. Lindstrom J. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2570-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) expressed in combination with hβ2 or hβ4 subunits produce functional α6*-nAChR that are sensitive to dominant-negative effects of coexpression with hα5 or hα5/hβ3 subunits, but also become more sensitive to agonists and have much higher function when coexpressed instead with hα5V9′S or chimeric, reporter mutant hα5/hβ3V9′S subunits. Finally we show that mutations in the N-terminal domain of the hα6 subunit (N143D and M145V) enable (hα5/hβ3V9′S) subunits to have a gain-of-function effect at hα6hβ2*-nAChR. These findings provide insight into the assembly, structure, and function of functional α6α5*-nAChR, which could be exploited as models for development of new ligands to affect mood and drug dependence. All chemicals for electrophysiology were obtained from Sigma. Fresh nicotine and mecamylamine stock solutions were made daily in Ringer solution and diluted as needed. cDNAs corresponding to human nAChR α6 (hα6), hα5, hβ2, hβ3, or hβ4 subunits were excised from vectors containing them and subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pGEMHE. Similarly, cDNA representing mouse nAChR α6 (mα6) subunit (kind gift from Dr. Jerry A. Stitzel, Department of Integrative Physiology, Institute for Behavioral Genetics, University of Colorado, Boulder, CO) was subcloned into pGEMHE. Construct integrity was confirmed by sequencing. Some specific mutations have been made in residues present in the second transmembrane domain (M2) of several nAChR subunits (e.g. at the so-called 9′ or 13′ positions, counting residues starting at the presumed, first residue in M2). Residues modified typically are thought to line the ion channel. Many studies, for example (20Labarca C. Nowak M.W. Zhang H. Tang L. Deshpande P. Lester H.A. Nature. 1995; 376: 514-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), indicate that some of these mutations can be used to monitor the incorporation of mutant subunits into nAChR assemblies, because they sometimes produce incremental increases in agonist sensitivity (i.e. they lower EC50 values for stimulation of nAChR function by a fixed degree, which is proportional to the number of mutant subunits incorporated into the pentamer). Thus, these altered subunits can serve as “reporter” mutants, because they can report when and how many mutant subunits are present in a functional nAChR. To the extent that they increase the apparent function of the complex, typically by increasing the magnitude of the peak whole cell current response to agonists relative to levels of function seen in nAChR lacking those subunits or when wild-type subunits are incorporated into complexes, but also by increasing agonist sensitivity as described just above, they are also called gain-of-function mutants. It is difficult to say whether these mutations might be physiologically relevant. The M2 9′ residue gain-of-function mutations in nAChR α7 subunits are lethal in transgenic mice (21Orr-Urtreger A. Broide R.S. Kasten M.R. Dang H. Dani J.A. Beaudet A.L. Patrick J.W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2154-2166Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and to human, neuron-like cell lines (22Lukas R.J.

Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1849-1860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and when present in a similar subunit, they produce late-onset death in a subset of Caenorhabditis elegans neurons (23Treinin M. Chalfie M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 871-877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, they may not be observed naturally in mammals if they are embryonically lethal. However, these mutations are very useful as experimental tools. Gain-of-function/reporter mutations in hα5 (V290S) or hβ3 (V273S) subunits were introduced into the pGEMHE background using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and also confirmed. Similarly, mutations in the N-terminal domain of the nAChR hα6 subunit (i.e. N143D + M145V) were introduced using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit.

The PCR-amplified hα5 subunit fragment was subcloned into the pCR®2.1-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen), in vivo amplified, and digested with BamHI and BspEI. A BspEI restriction site (underlined) was created in the pGEMHE-hβ3 construct by site-directed mutagenesis at position Arg230 by using primers: 5′- cacgtattccttcgtcctccggaggctgcctttattctatacc-3′ (forward) and 5′-ggtatagaataaaggcagcctccggaggacgaaggaatacgtg-3′ (reverse). The mutated pGEMHE-hβ3 plasmid was digested with BamHI and BspEI, where the BamHI site is located upstream of the N-terminal end of the hβ3 subunit cDNA and in the multiple cloning site. The pGEMHE plasmid devoid of the hβ3 subunit N-terminal fragment was gel purified. The restriction-digested hα5 and pGEMHE-hβ3 fragments were ligated, producing the chimera (hα5/hβ3) (hα5(Met1-Ile246)/hβ3(Arg230-His458)) (Fig. 1), which includes a total of 475 amino acid residues, and the final product was checked for integrity by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing prior to cRNA preparation. Similarly, to create the hα5/hβ3V9′S subunit chimera containing a reporter mutation, a BspEI restriction site was created in the pGEMHE-hβ3V9′S construct by site-directed mutagenesis at position Arg230 using the same pair of primers as above, and the rest of the procedures were the same as for creating the hα5/hβ3 subunit chimera. This resulted in a chimeric hα5/hβ3V9′S subunit (hα5(Met1-Ile246)/hβ3V273S(Arg230-His458)) (Fig. 1) that includes a total of 475 amino acid residues and was checked for integrity by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing prior to cRNA preparation. The hα6/hα3 subunit chimera plasmid ((containing the N-terminal, large extracellular domain, E1) of the hα6 subunit fused to domains from transmembrane region 1 through to the C terminus of the hα3 subunit) was a kind gift from Dr. John Lindstrom (10Kuryatov A. Olale F. Cooper J. Choi C. Lindstrom J. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2570-2590Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). All pGEMHE plasmids were linearized immediately downstream of the 3′-polyadenylation sequence. NheI was used to linearize mβ4, hα6, hα5, hα5V9′S, hβ3, hβ3V9′S, hα5/hβ3, hα5/hβ3V9′S and hβ4 subunit-containing plasmids. SbfI was used to linearize the hβ2 subunit cDNA. The hα6/hα3 subunit chimera plasmid was linearized using EcoRI. Capped mRNA was transcribed from linearized plasmids in a reaction mixture (25 μl) containing 1× transcription buffer, 1.6 mm rNTPs (Promega), 0.5 mm 7m-CAP (New England Biolabs), 1 μl of RNasin plus (New England Biolabs), and 1 μl of T7 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) with the exception that the linearized hα6/hα3 subunit chimera was transcribed using SP6 RNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) following a standard protocol. Integrity and quality of the cRNA was checked by electrophoresis and UV-spectroscopy. Female Xenopus laevis (Xenopus I, Ann Arbor, MI) were anesthetized using 0.2% tricaine methanesulfonate (MS-222). Ovarian lobes were surgically removed from the frogs and placed in an incubation solution that consisted of (in mm) 82.5 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 1 Na2HPO4, 0.6 theophylline, 2.5 sodium pyruvate, and 5 HEPES, plus 50 mg/ml of gentamycin, 50 units/ml of penicillin, and 50 μg/ml of streptomycin, pH 7.5. The frogs were allowed to recover from surgery before being returned to the incubation tank. The lobes were cut into small pieces and digested with 0.08 Wunsch units/ml of liberase blendzyme 3 (Roche Applied Science) with constant stirring at room temperature for 1.5–2 h. The dispersed oocytes were thoroughly rinsed with incubation solution. Stage VI oocytes were selected and incubated at 16 °C before injection. Micropipettes used for injection were pulled from borosilicate glass (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA) using a Sutter P87 horizontal puller, and the tips were broken with forceps to ∼40 μm in diameter. cRNA was drawn up into the micropipette and injected into oocytes using a Nanoject microinjection system (Drummond Scientific) at a total volume of ∼60 nl. To express nAChR in oocytes, about 4 ng of cRNA corresponding to each nAChR subunit was injected. Lacking a priori knowledge about levels of mRNA for specific subunits present in neurons, and not wishing to bias results by injecting disparate amounts of nAChR subunit cRNAs into oocytes, we chose to introduce identical amounts of cRNA, presumably producing equal amounts of each subunit protein, into oocytes. For several reasons as explained under “Discussion,” we did not define subunit ratios in the cell surface, functional nAChR in oocytes. Instead, we provisionally assumed that α6 and β2 or β4 subunits would form complexes having 2:3 and/or 3:2 ratios of the indicated subunits and that oocytes also injected with α5 or β3 subunits or variants would express nAChR with 2:2:1 ratios of α6:β2 or β4:α5 or β3 subunits. Two to 7 days after injection, oocytes were placed in a small volume chamber and continuously perfused with oocyte Ringer solution, which consisted of (in mm) 92.5 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.5. The chamber was grounded through an agarose bridge. The oocytes were voltage-clamped at −70 mV (unless otherwise noted) to measure agonist-induced currents using AxoClamp 900A and pClamp 10.2 software (Axon Instruments). The current signal was low-pass filtered at 10 Hz with the built-in low-pass Bessel filter in the Axoclamp 900A and digitized at 20 Hz with Axon Digidata 1440A and pClamp 10.2. Electrodes contained 3 m KCl and had a resistance of 1–2 megohms. Drugs (agonists and antagonists) were prepared daily in bath solution. Drugs were applied using a Valvelink 8.2 perfusion system (Automate Scientific, Berkeley, CA). All electrophysiological measurements were conducted or checked in at least two batches of oocytes. Injection of water or empty vector (used as two forms of negative controls) or of cRNA corresponding to one subunit alone or pairwise combinations of nAChR hα5, hα5V9′S, (hα5/hβ3), or (hα5/hβ3V9′S) subunits with either an α6 subunit or β2 or β4 subunits (10–12 ng of total cRNA) did not result in the expression of functional nAChR. Current responses to 100 μm nicotine were less than 5–10 nA (data not shown). Raw data were collected and processed in part using pClamp 10.2 (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and a spreadsheet (Excel, Microsoft, Bellevue, WA), using peak current amplitudes (Imax) as measures of functional nAChR expression and results were pooled across experiments (mean ± S.E. for data from at least three oocytes). In some cases, mean peak current amplitudes in response to a single concentration of an agonist were compared across different subunit combinations. However, assessment of true Imax values for different nAChR subunit combinations required evaluations based on more complete concentration-response relationships, in which mean peak current amplitudes at specified ligand concentrations were fit to the Hill equation or its variants using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). F-tests (p < 0.05 to define statistical significance) were carried out to compare the best fit values of log molar EC50 values across specific nAChR subunit combinations. There are limitations in the ability to compare levels of functional nAChR expression, even though we injected similar amounts of RNA for all constructs. This is because expression levels assessed as peak current amplitudes are affected by batch-to-batch variations in oocytes, time between cRNA injection and recording, and subunit combination-specific parameters, such as channel open probability (influenced by gating rate constants, rates and extents of desensitization), single channel conductance, subunit assembly efficiency, and efficiency of receptor trafficking to the cell surface (19Groot-Kormelink P.J. Boorman J.P. Sivilotti L.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 134: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We made no attempt to measure or control for subunit combination-specific effects, but whenever preliminary studies revealed possible differences in peak current amplitudes, findings were further confirmed across different subunit combinations using the same batch of oocytes and the same time between cRNA injection and recording. Peak current amplitudes are shown from representative traces in some figures presented below, pooled data from limited sets of studies, and mean peak current amplitudes across all studies for a given combination of subunits as presented in the tables sometimes differ. However, when we make statements about results comparing ligand potencies and efficacies across subunit combinations, the observations are clear, significant, and in agreement whether for pooled data or for results from smaller sets of studies (one-way analyses of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests). In initial studies, coexpression of nAChR wild-type hα6 and hβ4 subunits produced nicotinic responses manifest as inward currents in only about 3–5% of injected oocytes. Functional responses to 100 μm ACh when present were very modest (22 ± 3 nA) (data not shown). It was difficult to obtain measurable and reproducible responses to nicotine. Coexpression with presumed accessory, wild-type hα5, mutant hα5V9′S subunits, or chimeric hα5/hβ3 subunits along with wild-type hα6 and hβ4 subunits did not produce any response to nicotine. However, coexpression with chimeric mutant hα5/hβ3V9′S subunits as accessory partners significantly increased nicotinic responses to 10 μm nicotine (225 ± 31 nA), and nearly every oocyte injected with nAChR hα6, hβ4, and mutant hα5/hβ3V9′S subunits expressed functional nAChR (Fig. 2, Table 2). These results at least indicated that both hα5/hβ3 and mutant hα5/hβ3V9′S subunits incorporate into at least some complexes containing hα6 and hβ4 subunits, because agonist sensitivities (EC50 values) that could be assessed changed as a function of subunits injected into oocytes. Moreover, the results also show that incorporation of nAChR hα5/hβ3 subunits into hα6hβ4*-nAChR has a dominant-negative effect, reflected by lack of functional receptors (again, assuming that peak current amplitudes are legitimate proxies for functional nAChR expression levels, with the caveats about this interpretation mentioned under “Experimental Procedures,” “Data Analyses”). By contrast, incorporation of nAChR hα5/hβ3V9′S subunits produces a gain-of-function effect reflected by an increase in agonist sensitivity and in absolute levels of functional receptor expression.TABLE 2Parameters for ligand action at nAChR containing α6 nAChR subunits Open table in a new tab Knowing that at least some α6*-nAChR are functional in mice, and but lacking such documentation of native, all-human α6*-nAChR function, we had previously extended our work to mouse nAChR subunits and found that coexpression of hβ3 subunits with mα6 and hβ4 nAChR subunits form hybrid (i.e. composed of subunits from two different species), functional mα6hβ4hβ3-nAChR (18Dash, B., Bhakta, M., Chang, Y., Lukas, R. J. (August 10, 2011) J. Biol. Chem. DOI 10.1074/jbc.M111.263673.Google Scholar). This and the findings just above that functional nAChR hα6hβ4(hα5/hβ3V9′S) could be formed led us to explore effects of the incorporation of hα5 or hα5/hβ3 subunits on function of the hybrid mα6hβ4*-nAChR. Oocytes expressing nAChR mα6 and hβ4 alone or with wild-type hα5 subunits from co-injected cRNAs failed to respond to nicotine (Table 2). Substitution for wild-type hα5 subunits with hα5/hβ3V9′S subunits, but not with hα5V9′S or hα5/hβ3 subunits, yielded oocytes in which maximal responses were achieved in the presence of 10 μm nicotine (Fig. 2, Table 2). Nicotine concentration-response relationships yielded EC50 values of 0.87 μm for mα6hβ4(hα5/hβ3V9′S)-nAChR (Table 2). These findings suggest that mutant hα5/hβ3V9′S subunits also serve as gain-of-function partners for mα6hβ4*-nAChR. Coexpression of nAChR wild-type hα6 or mα6 plus hβ2 subunits did not yield oocytes responding to nicotine (data not shown). Additional expression of wild-type hα5 or hα5/hβ3 subunits does not alter this circumstance, nor does additional expression of mutant hα5V9′S or hα5/hβ3V9′S subunits (Table 2). These results indicate that although the nAChR mutant hα5/hβ3V9′S subunits exert gain-of-function effects on hα6hβ4*- or mα6hβ4*-nAChR, they are unable to activate the function of hα6hβ2*- or mα6hβ2*-nAChR expressed in oocytes. Oocytes expressing chimeric hα6/hα3 and hβ2 subunits occasionally d"
