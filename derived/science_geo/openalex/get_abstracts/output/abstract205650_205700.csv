https://openalex.org/W1990667370,"Normally fluent subjects were required to read from printed pages, and a recording was made of nonfluencies until a stable rate was established. A persistent shock was then introduced. Its cessation for a limited period was made contingent upon nonfluency. Chronic stuttering was instated and eliminated as a function of the change in stimulus."

https://openalex.org/W2037005526,Learned responses are absent during intense hippocampal discharges. Their absence is attributable not to a disruption of learning but to an effect upon the motor system.

https://openalex.org/W2041652023,"Continuous, accurate recording in circulating fluids from a sodium and a potassium electrode is described. The Na electrode is capable of discriminating Delta[Na(+)] of less than 1 meq/lit. in 140 meq/lit., and the K electrode is capable of discriminating Delta[K(+)] of less than 1 meq/lit. in the range of 1 to 10 meq/lit. with good reproducibility. The electrodes may be used singly or in pairs with a common reference calomel electrode for simultaneous monitoring of A [Na(+) 1 and Delta[K(+)] in mixed solutions. Problems of streaming potential dependent on flow rate and electrode shape, as well as transient K(+) response by the Na electrode, are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2026652613,Data are summarized from a study of the uptake of strontium-90 by plants growing in the radionuclide and controlled concentrations of calcium. It was concluded that high levels of soil calcium and potassium decrease strontium-90 and cesium-137 uptake by plants. The depth of feeding of the plant was also found to be an important factor in the natural absorption of radionuclides arising from fall-out from the soil. (C.H.)

https://openalex.org/W1964437654,"MANY new amino-acids have been isolated from higher plants in recent years1. However, little is known concerning the function and metabolism of the majority of these acids. Frequently they have been considered to be rather akin to alkaloids; they are often found to be randomly distributed among the members of the plant kingdom, and yet they accumulate in large amounts in certain plants, sometimes being confined mainly to particular organs. These features suggest that a number of the acids are perhaps secondary products (by-products) of metabolism that can only slowly re-enter the main pathways of metabolism operative in plants."
https://openalex.org/W2014181555,"In 1907 Dévé1 reported the successful infection of a rabbit by the subcutaneous injection of Echinococcus granulosus eggs which produced a single fertile hydatid cyst. Leonard and Leonard2, studying the resistance of rabbits to the larvæ of Tænia pisiformis, infected these animals by the injection of hatched eggs into the mesenteric vein. Fedeli Avanzi3 reported that the intraperitoneal injection of hydatid sand into rabbits failed to produce any infection, but Batham4 successfully infected mice by the intraperitoneal injection of E. granulosus eggs."

https://openalex.org/W2027345183,"IN a previous paper1 indirect adaptation to D-arabinose induced by L-rhamnose in some D-arabinose negative strains of Escherichia coli has been reported. These strains when grown on L-rhamnose, metabolize D-arabinose and utilize it for growth. This effect is not due to selection of mutants but to enzymic adaptation: induction of D-arabinose isomerase by L-rhamnose has been demonstrated."

Lowest values are found in the high central valley, where samples used in estimating world-wide distribution of fallout were collected. If the major fallout deposition occurs in the interior of the South American continent, such estimates for these latitudes may be low by as much as a factor of ten. Although there has apparently been greater Sr90 deposition in regions of greater rainfall, analysis of data from 16 locations fails to show a significant correlation between rainfall and fallout."
