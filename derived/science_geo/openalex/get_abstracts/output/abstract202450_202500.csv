https://openalex.org/W93532817,"The information contained in the amino acid sequence of a protein is linear, such as it is in DNA, but proteins function by
 virtue of the arrangement of their linear structure into a well-defined three-dimensional conformation. In this article,
 Anfinsen and Haber sought to determine how the two-dimensional data of DNA were translated into the three-dimensional information
 that was characteristic of globular proteins. This simple and elegant experiment was designed to determine what would happen
 when reduced, unfolded, and enzymatically inactive ribonuclease was allowed simply to refold in the presence of only neutral
 aqueous buffer and air. They found that most of the activity of the enzyme was regained."

https://openalex.org/W16843975,"Among the recognized morphological features of cells, the esternal membrane is one of the most poorly understood in terms of both structure and function, especially with regard to its participation in transport processes. In recent years, the chemical and enzymatic composition of isolated cell membranes from a few species of bacterial organisms have received the attention of a number of investigators (1) after the demonstration by Weibull (2) that cell membranes could be prepared by osmotic lysis of bacterial protoplasts. The recent finding (3) in this laboratory that protoplasts could be prepared from Streptococcus jaecalis (ATCC ~9790) by treatment with lysozyme, has now made it possible to isolate the cell membrane from this organism and to initiate a study of its chemical and enzymatic constitution. Our first efforts were directed to the enzyme adenosine triphosphatase, because in previous studies with the intact cells and protoplasts, the presence of this enzyme in the cell membrane was proposed in order to account for the changes in permeability that occur during glycolysis and subsequent to cessation of glycolysis (3, 4). In the present paper, evidence will be presented that the isolated membranes of S. jaecalis contain adenosine triphosphatase, and some properties of this enzyme will be described. In addition, procedures for the preparation of the cell membranes from S. jaecalis will be described, inasmuch as these structures have not been previously isolated from this organism."

The crucial tests (delayed response, string tests, and discrimination learning) were performed 3 to 4 months postoperatively. At this time, no significant differences between normal animals and animals with prefrontal lesions were found."

https://openalex.org/W2060130095,"HEREDITARY susceptibility to hæmolysis by drugs and fava beans is believed to be due to a single sex-linked gene. This mode of inheritance would best explain the familial and population data, as summarized recently by Childs and Zinkham1. The main element of uncertainty regarding this hypothesis arises from the great variability of the measured blood abnormalities in heterozygous females (in vitro glutathione stability test and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity)."

https://openalex.org/W1979441528,"Mice were tested in a situation permitting them to step readily from a small, restrictive platform to a larger one. Conditioned avoidance was established by a single training trial when animals received a shock by stepping from one platform to another. At various intervals after the single punishing shock, subjects were anesthetized with diethyl ether. Interference with retention, tested 1 day later, was shown for intervals up to 24 minutes, at which time ether no longer appeared to influence the subsequent response."
https://openalex.org/W1965787492,"SINCE 1885 the Botanic Gardens in Georgetown, British Guiana, has had in some ornamental pools manatees (Trichechus manatus, order Sirenia), which have been always fed with grass by visitors. These pools have been kept clear by the manatees and it seemed always necessary to get additional food in the form of grass. It was therefore felt that experiments should be proceeded with using these animals for weed control, and some have been maintained in the reservoirs of the water purification plant and have effectively kept these clear of aquatic plants, particularly Cabomba aquatica, Anacharis, Leersia, Utricularia."

https://openalex.org/W1990597683,Fungi which were separated from their lichenized associations and cultured independently produced several unusual and highly pigmented compounds. Certain of these compounds exhibited marked inhibitory activity against test strains of gram-positive bacteria and free-living molds; others showed a growth stimulatory effect on selected bacterial species.
https://openalex.org/W2079559622,"SCHWARTZ et al. observed that certain commercially obtainable hæmatoporphyrin preparations were contaminated by a porphyrin capable of becoming localized in experimental tumours1,2, and that pure hæmatoporphyrin was unable to do so. These findings gave the impetus to the present work on halogenoporphyrins. The premise on the basis of which halogenoporphyrins were chosen was the assumption that the aforementioned impurity represents an intermediate formed in the course of the synthesis of hæmatoporphyrin from hæmin. One such intermediate could be bis-(2-bromo-ethyl)deuteroporphyrin. Since iodine–131 is a more convenient isotope for the purpose of labelling than isotopes of bromine, the iodine 131–labelled analogue was synthesized."

https://openalex.org/W1995205848,"FOLLOWING the early work of Taylor et al. 1, it is generally believed that the arthropod-borne viruses contain ribonucleic acid, protein and lipid. Recent work has shown that the ribonucleic acid fraction extracted by phenol from several viruses of this group is infective2. In the intact virus the protein fraction probably protects this ribonucleic acid and may have other functions. The present report considers a lipid component of the virus of Murray Valley encephalitis virus, and shows that this virus is inactivated by phospholipase A."
