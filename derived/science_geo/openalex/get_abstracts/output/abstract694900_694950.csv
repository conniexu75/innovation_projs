https://openalex.org/W4281751308,"Li- and Mn-rich (LMR) cathode materials that utilize both cation and anion redox can yield substantial increases in battery energy density1-3. However, although voltage decay issues cause continuous energy loss and impede commercialization, the prerequisite driving force for this phenomenon remains a mystery3-6 Here, with in situ nanoscale sensitive coherent X-ray diffraction imaging techniques, we reveal that nanostrain and lattice displacement accumulate continuously during operation of the cell. Evidence shows that this effect is the driving force for both structure degradation and oxygen loss, which trigger the well-known rapid voltage decay in LMR cathodes. By carrying out micro- to macro-length characterizations that span atomic structure, the primary particle, multiparticle and electrode levels, we demonstrate that the heterogeneous nature of LMR cathodes inevitably causes pernicious phase displacement/strain, which cannot be eliminated by conventional doping or coating methods. We therefore propose mesostructural design as a strategy to mitigate lattice displacement and inhomogeneous electrochemical/structural evolutions, thereby achieving stable voltage and capacity profiles. These findings highlight the significance of lattice strain/displacement in causing voltage decay and will inspire a wave of efforts to unlock the potential of the broad-scale commercialization of LMR cathode materials."
https://openalex.org/W4281755657,"Synonymous mutations in protein-coding genes do not alter protein sequences and are thus generally presumed to be neutral or nearly neutral1-5. Here, to experimentally verify this presumption, we constructed 8,341 yeast mutants each carrying a synonymous, nonsynonymous or nonsense mutation in one of 21 endogenous genes with diverse functions and expression levels and measured their fitness relative to the wild type in a rich medium. Three-quarters of synonymous mutations resulted in a significant reduction in fitness, and the distribution of fitness effects was overall similar-albeit nonidentical-between synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations. Both synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations frequently disturbed the level of mRNA expression of the mutated gene, and the extent of the disturbance partially predicted the fitness effect. Investigations in additional environments revealed greater across-environment fitness variations for nonsynonymous mutants than for synonymous mutants despite their similar fitness distributions in each environment, suggesting that a smaller proportion of nonsynonymous mutants than synonymous mutants are always non-deleterious in a changing environment to permit fixation, potentially explaining the common observation of substantially lower nonsynonymous than synonymous substitution rates. The strong non-neutrality of most synonymous mutations, if it holds true for other genes and in other organisms, would require re-examination of numerous biological conclusions about mutation, selection, effective population size, divergence time and disease mechanisms that rely on the assumption that synoymous mutations are neutral."
https://openalex.org/W4282557486,"Abstract Potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) is the world’s most important non-cereal food crop, and the vast majority of commercially grown cultivars are highly heterozygous tetraploids. Advances in diploid hybrid breeding based on true seeds have the potential to revolutionize future potato breeding and production 1–4 . So far, relatively few studies have examined the genome evolution and diversity of wild and cultivated landrace potatoes, which limits the application of their diversity in potato breeding. Here we assemble 44 high-quality diploid potato genomes from 24 wild and 20 cultivated accessions that are representative of Solanum section Petota , the tuber-bearing clade, as well as 2 genomes from the neighbouring section, Etuberosum . Extensive discordance of phylogenomic relationships suggests the complexity of potato evolution. We find that the potato genome substantially expanded its repertoire of disease-resistance genes when compared with closely related seed-propagated solanaceous crops, indicative of the effect of tuber-based propagation strategies on the evolution of the potato genome. We discover a transcription factor that determines tuber identity and interacts with the mobile tuberization inductive signal SP6A. We also identify 561,433 high-confidence structural variants and construct a map of large inversions, which provides insights for improving inbred lines and precluding potential linkage drag, as exemplified by a 5.8-Mb inversion that is associated with carotenoid content in tubers. This study will accelerate hybrid potato breeding and enrich our understanding of the evolution and biology of potato as a global staple food crop."
https://openalex.org/W4282923872,"Abstract Missing heritability in genome-wide association studies defines a major problem in genetic analyses of complex biological traits 1,2 . The solution to this problem is to identify all causal genetic variants and to measure their individual contributions 3,4 . Here we report a graph pangenome of tomato constructed by precisely cataloguing more than 19 million variants from 838 genomes, including 32 new reference-level genome assemblies. This graph pangenome was used for genome-wide association study analyses and heritability estimation of 20,323 gene-expression and metabolite traits. The average estimated trait heritability is 0.41 compared with 0.33 when using the single linear reference genome. This 24% increase in estimated heritability is largely due to resolving incomplete linkage disequilibrium through the inclusion of additional causal structural variants identified using the graph pangenome. Moreover, by resolving allelic and locus heterogeneity, structural variants improve the power to identify genetic factors underlying agronomically important traits leading to, for example, the identification of two new genes potentially contributing to soluble solid content. The newly identified structural variants will facilitate genetic improvement of tomato through both marker-assisted selection and genomic selection. Our study advances the understanding of the heritability of complex traits and demonstrates the power of the graph pangenome in crop breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3182570346,"Interpreting high-energy, astrophysical phenomena, such as supernova explosions or neutron-star collisions, requires a robust understanding of matter at supranuclear densities. However, our knowledge about dense matter explored in the cores of neutron stars remains limited. Fortunately, dense matter is not probed only in astrophysical observations, but also in terrestrial heavy-ion collision experiments. Here we use Bayesian inference to combine data from astrophysical multi-messenger observations of neutron stars1-9 and from heavy-ion collisions of gold nuclei at relativistic energies10,11 with microscopic nuclear theory calculations12-17 to improve our understanding of dense matter. We find that the inclusion of heavy-ion collision data indicates an increase in the pressure in dense matter relative to previous analyses, shifting neutron-star radii towards larger values, consistent with recent observations by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer mission5-8,18. Our findings show that constraints from heavy-ion collision experiments show a remarkable consistency with multi-messenger observations and provide complementary information on nuclear matter at intermediate densities. This work combines nuclear theory, nuclear experiment and astrophysical observations, and shows how joint analyses can shed light on the properties of neutron-rich supranuclear matter over the density range probed in neutron stars."
https://openalex.org/W4282930996,"Abstract The dispersive sweep of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has been used to probe the ionized baryon content of the intergalactic medium 1 , which is assumed to dominate the total extragalactic dispersion. Although the host-galaxy contributions to the dispersion measure appear to be small for most FRBs 2 , in at least one case there is evidence for an extreme magneto-ionic local environment 3,4 and a compact persistent radio source 5 . Here we report the detection and localization of the repeating FRB 20190520B, which is co-located with a compact, persistent radio source and associated with a dwarf host galaxy of high specific-star-formation rate at a redshift of 0.241 ± 0.001.

https://openalex.org/W4281763324,"Transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) has been identified as key host cell factor for viral entry and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. Specifically, TMPRSS2 proteolytically processes the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) protein, enabling virus–host membrane fusion and infection of the airways. We present here a recombinant production strategy for enzymatically active TMPRSS2 and characterization of its matured proteolytic activity, as well as its 1.95 Å X-ray cocrystal structure with the synthetic protease inhibitor nafamostat. Our study provides a structural basis for the potent but nonspecific inhibition by nafamostat and identifies distinguishing features of the TMPRSS2 substrate binding pocket that explain specificity. TMPRSS2 cleaved SARS-CoV-2 S protein at multiple sites, including the canonical S1/S2 cleavage site. We ranked the potency of clinical protease inhibitors with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 1.4 nM to 120 µM and determined inhibitor mechanisms of action, providing the groundwork for drug development efforts to selectively inhibit TMPRSS2. The first crystal structure of human TMPRSS2, a proteolytic driver of SARS-CoV-2 infection in airways and an antiviral target, reveals structural features of viral spike protein and protease inhibitor binding."
https://openalex.org/W4282945568,"During infection, animals exhibit adaptive changes in physiology and behaviour aimed at increasing survival. Although many causes of infection exist, they trigger similar stereotyped symptoms such as fever, warmth-seeking, loss of appetite and fatigue1,2. Yet exactly how the nervous system alters body temperature and triggers sickness behaviours to coordinate responses to infection remains unknown. Here we identify a previously uncharacterized population of neurons in the ventral medial preoptic area (VMPO) of the hypothalamus that are activated after sickness induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid. These neurons are crucial for generating a fever response and other sickness symptoms such as warmth-seeking and loss of appetite. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing and multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization uncovered the identity and distribution of LPS-activated VMPO (VMPOLPS) neurons and non-neuronal cells. Gene expression and electrophysiological measurements implicate a paracrine mechanism in which the release of immune signals by non-neuronal cells during infection activates nearby VMPOLPS neurons. Finally, we show that VMPOLPS neurons exert a broad influence on the activity of brain areas associated with behavioural and homeostatic functions and are synaptically and functionally connected to circuit nodes controlling body temperature and appetite. Together, these results uncover VMPOLPS neurons as a control hub that integrates immune signals to orchestrate multiple sickness symptoms in response to infection."
https://openalex.org/W4282926624,"Branched fatty acid (FA) esters of hydroxy FAs (HFAs; FAHFAs) are recently discovered lipids that are conserved from yeast to mammals1,2. A subfamily, palmitic acid esters of hydroxy stearic acids (PAHSAs), are anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic1,3. Humans and mice with insulin resistance have lower PAHSA levels in subcutaneous adipose tissue and serum1. PAHSA administration improves glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation in obesity, diabetes and immune-mediated diseases1,4-7. The enzyme(s) responsible for FAHFA biosynthesis in vivo remains unknown. Here we identified adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL, also known as patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 2 (PNPLA2)) as a candidate biosynthetic enzyme for FAHFAs using chemical biology and proteomics. We discovered that recombinant ATGL uses a transacylation reaction that esterifies an HFA with a FA from triglyceride (TG) or diglyceride to produce FAHFAs. Overexpression of wild-type, but not catalytically dead, ATGL increases FAHFA biosynthesis. Chemical inhibition of ATGL or genetic deletion of Atgl inhibits FAHFA biosynthesis and reduces the levels of FAHFA and FAHFA-TG. Levels of endogenous and nascent FAHFAs and FAHFA-TGs are 80-90 per cent lower in adipose tissue of mice in which Atgl is knocked out specifically in the adipose tissue. Increasing TG levels by upregulating diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) activity promotes FAHFA biosynthesis, and decreasing DGAT activity inhibits it, reinforcing TGs as FAHFA precursors. ATGL biosynthetic transacylase activity is present in human adipose tissue underscoring its potential clinical relevance. In summary, we discovered the first, to our knowledge, biosynthetic enzyme that catalyses the formation of the FAHFA ester bond in mammals. Whereas ATGL lipase activity is well known, our data establish a paradigm shift demonstrating that ATGL transacylase activity is biologically important."
https://openalex.org/W4282915758,"DNA replication occurs through an intricately regulated series of molecular events and is fundamental for genome stability1,2. At present, it is unknown how the locations of replication origins are determined in the human genome. Here we dissect the role of topologically associating domains (TADs)3-6, subTADs7 and loops8 in the positioning of replication initiation zones (IZs). We stratify TADs and subTADs by the presence of corner-dots indicative of loops and the orientation of CTCF motifs. We find that high-efficiency, early replicating IZs localize to boundaries between adjacent corner-dot TADs anchored by high-density arrays of divergently and convergently oriented CTCF motifs. By contrast, low-efficiency IZs localize to weaker dotless boundaries. Following ablation of cohesin-mediated loop extrusion during G1, high-efficiency IZs become diffuse and delocalized at boundaries with complex CTCF motif orientations. Moreover, G1 knockdown of the cohesin unloading factor WAPL results in gained long-range loops and narrowed localization of IZs at the same boundaries. Finally, targeted deletion or insertion of specific boundaries causes local replication timing shifts consistent with IZ loss or gain, respectively. Our data support a model in which cohesin-mediated loop extrusion and stalling at a subset of genetically encoded TAD and subTAD boundaries is an essential determinant of the locations of replication origins in human S phase."

https://openalex.org/W4282917222,"γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter 1 (GAT1)1 regulates neuronal excitation of the central nervous system by clearing the synaptic cleft of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA upon its release from synaptic vesicles. Elevating the levels of GABA in the synaptic cleft, by inhibiting GABA reuptake transporters, is an established strategy to treat neurological disorders, such as epilepsy2. Here we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of full-length, wild-type human GAT1 in complex with its clinically used inhibitor tiagabine3, with an ordered part of only 60 kDa. Our structure reveals that tiagabine locks GAT1 in the inward-open conformation, by blocking the intracellular gate of the GABA release pathway, and thus suppresses neurotransmitter uptake. Our results provide insights into the mixed-type inhibition of GAT1 by tiagabine, which is an important anticonvulsant medication. Its pharmacodynamic profile, confirmed by our experimental data, suggests initial binding of tiagabine to the substrate-binding site in the outward-open conformation, whereas our structure presents the drug stalling the transporter in the inward-open conformation, consistent with a two-step mechanism of inhibition4. The presented structure of GAT1 gives crucial insights into the biology and pharmacology of this important neurotransmitter transporter and provides blueprints for the rational design of neuromodulators, as well as moving the boundaries of what is considered possible in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy of challenging membrane proteins. Structural determination of GAT1 using cryo-electron microscopy provides insights into the biology and pharmacology of this GABA transporter."
https://openalex.org/W4282922390,"Abstract Synthetic receptor signalling has the potential to endow adoptively transferred T cells with new functions that overcome major barriers in the treatment of solid tumours, including the need for conditioning chemotherapy 1,2 . Here we designed chimeric receptors that have an orthogonal IL-2 receptor extracellular domain (ECD) fused with the intracellular domain (ICD) of receptors for common γ-chain (γ c ) cytokines IL-4, IL-7, IL-9 and IL-21 such that the orthogonal IL-2 cytokine elicits the corresponding γ c cytokine signal. Of these, T cells that signal through the chimeric orthogonal IL-2Rβ-ECD–IL-9R-ICD (o9R) are distinguished by the concomitant activation of STAT1, STAT3 and STAT5 and assume characteristics of stem cell memory and effector T cells. Compared to o2R T cells, o9R T cells have superior anti-tumour efficacy in two recalcitrant syngeneic mouse solid tumour models of melanoma and pancreatic cancer and are effective even in the absence of conditioning lymphodepletion. Therefore, by repurposing IL-9R signalling using a chimeric orthogonal cytokine receptor, T cells gain new functions, and this results in improved anti-tumour activity for hard-to-treat solid tumours."
https://openalex.org/W4281861111,"Majorana zero modes (MZMs) obey non-Abelian statistics and are considered building blocks for constructing topological qubits1,2. Iron-based superconductors with topological bandstructures have emerged as promising hosting materials, because isolated candidate MZMs in the quantum limit have been observed inside the topological vortex cores3-9. However, these materials suffer from issues related to alloying induced disorder, uncontrolled vortex lattices10-13 and a low yield of topological vortices5-8. Here we report the formation of an ordered and tunable MZM lattice in naturally strained stoichiometric LiFeAs by scanning tunnelling microscopy/spectroscopy. We observe biaxial charge density wave (CDW) stripes along the Fe-Fe and As-As directions in the strained regions. The vortices are pinned on the CDW stripes in the As-As direction and form an ordered lattice. We detect that more than 90 per cent of the vortices are topological and possess the characteristics of isolated MZMs at the vortex centre, forming an ordered MZM lattice with the density and the geometry tunable by an external magnetic field. Notably, with decreasing the spacing of neighbouring vortices, the MZMs start to couple with each other. Our findings provide a pathway towards tunable and ordered MZM lattices as a platform for future topological quantum computation."
https://openalex.org/W4282034869,"Spatially resolved vibrational mapping of nanostructures is indispensable to the development and understanding of thermal nanodevices1, modulation of thermal transport2 and novel nanostructured thermoelectric materials3-5. Through the engineering of complex structures, such as alloys, nanostructures and superlattice interfaces, one can significantly alter the propagation of phonons and suppress material thermal conductivity while maintaining electrical conductivity2. There have been no correlative experiments that spatially track the modulation of phonon properties in and around nanostructures due to spatial resolution limitations of conventional optical phonon detection techniques. Here we demonstrate two-dimensional spatial mapping of phonons in a single silicon-germanium (SiGe) quantum dot (QD) using monochromated electron energy loss spectroscopy in the transmission electron microscope. Tracking the variation of the Si optical mode in and around the QD, we observe the nanoscale modification of the composition-induced red shift. We observe non-equilibrium phonons that only exist near the interface and, furthermore, develop a novel technique to differentially map phonon momenta, providing direct evidence that the interplay between diffuse and specular reflection largely depends on the detailed atomistic structure: a major advancement in the field. Our work unveils the non-equilibrium phonon dynamics at nanoscale interfaces and can be used to study actual nanodevices and aid in the understanding of heat dissipation near nanoscale hotspots, which is crucial for future high-performance nanoelectronics."
https://openalex.org/W4282914277,"Abstract Mitoribosomes are essential for the synthesis and maintenance of bioenergetic proteins. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy to determine a series of the small mitoribosomal subunit (SSU) intermediates in complex with auxiliary factors, revealing a sequential assembly mechanism. The methyltransferase TFB1M binds to partially unfolded rRNA h45 that is promoted by RBFA, while the mRNA channel is blocked. This enables binding of METTL15 that promotes further rRNA maturation and a large conformational change of RBFA. The new conformation allows initiation factor mtIF3 to already occupy the subunit interface during the assembly. Finally, the mitochondria-specific ribosomal protein mS37 (ref. 1 ) outcompetes RBFA to complete the assembly with the SSU–mS37–mtIF3 complex 2 that proceeds towards mtIF2 binding and translation initiation. Our results explain how the action of step-specific factors modulate the dynamic assembly of the SSU, and adaptation of a unique protein, mS37, links the assembly to initiation to establish the catalytic human mitoribosome."
https://openalex.org/W4282934548,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) lie at the heart of eukaryotic cell cycle control, with different cyclin-CDK complexes initiating DNA replication (S-CDKs) and mitosis (M-CDKs)1,2. However, the principles on which cyclin-CDK complexes organize the temporal order of cell cycle events are contentious3. One model proposes that S-CDKs and M-CDKs are functionally specialized, with substantially different substrate specificities to execute different cell cycle events4-6. A second model proposes that S-CDKs and M-CDKs are redundant with each other, with both acting as sources of overall CDK activity7,8. In this model, increasing CDK activity, rather than CDK substrate specificity, orders cell cycle events9,10. Here we reconcile these two views of core cell cycle control. Using phosphoproteomic assays of in vivo CDK activity in fission yeast, we find that S-CDK and M-CDK substrate specificities are remarkably similar, showing that S-CDKs and M-CDKs are not completely specialized for S phase and mitosis alone. Normally, S-CDK cannot drive mitosis but can do so when protein phosphatase 1 is removed from the centrosome. Thus, increasing S-CDK activity in vivo is sufficient to overcome substrate specificity differences between S-CDK and M-CDK, and allows S-CDK to carry out M-CDK function. Therefore, we unite the two opposing views of cell cycle control, showing that the core cell cycle engine is largely based on a quantitative increase in CDK activity through the cell cycle, combined with minor and surmountable qualitative differences in catalytic specialization of S-CDKs and M-CDKs."
https://openalex.org/W4282935598,"Abstract Solar flares, driven by prompt release of free magnetic energy in the solar corona 1,2 , are known to accelerate a substantial portion (ten per cent or more) 3,4 of available electrons to high energies. Hard X-rays, produced by high-energy electrons accelerated in the flare 5 , require a high ambient density for their detection. This restricts the observed volume to denser regions that do not necessarily sample the entire volume of accelerated electrons 6 . Here we report evolving spatially resolved distributions of thermal and non-thermal electrons in a solar flare derived from microwave observations that show the true extent of the acceleration region. These distributions show a volume filled with only (or almost only) non-thermal electrons while being depleted of the thermal plasma, implying that all electrons have experienced a prominent acceleration there. This volume is isolated from a surrounding, more typical flare plasma of mainly thermal particles with a smaller proportion of non-thermal electrons. This highly efficient acceleration happens in the same volume in which the free magnetic energy is being released 2 ."
https://openalex.org/W4282931587,"Although bradykinesia, tremor and rigidity are the hallmark motor defects in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), patients also experience motor learning impairments and non-motor symptoms such as depression1. The neural circuit basis for these different symptoms of PD are not well understood. Although current treatments are effective for locomotion deficits in PD2,3, therapeutic strategies targeting motor learning deficits and non-motor symptoms are lacking4–6. Here we found that distinct parafascicular (PF) thalamic subpopulations project to caudate putamen (CPu), subthalamic nucleus (STN) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Whereas PF→CPu and PF→STN circuits are critical for locomotion and motor learning, respectively, inhibition of the PF→NAc circuit induced a depression-like state. Whereas chemogenetically manipulating CPu-projecting PF neurons led to a long-term restoration of locomotion, optogenetic long-term potentiation (LTP) at PF→STN synapses restored motor learning behaviour in an acute mouse model of PD. Furthermore, activation of NAc-projecting PF neurons rescued depression-like phenotypes. Further, we identified nicotinic acetylcholine receptors capable of modulating PF circuits to rescue different PD phenotypes. Thus, targeting PF thalamic circuits may be an effective strategy for treating motor and non-motor deficits in PD."
https://openalex.org/W4282941652,"The formation of strongly correlated fermion pairs is fundamental for the emergence of fermionic superfluidity and superconductivity1. For instance, Cooper pairs made of two electrons of opposite spin and momentum at the Fermi surface of the system are a key ingredient of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory-the microscopic explanation of the emergence of conventional superconductivity2. Understanding the mechanism behind pair formation is an ongoing challenge in the study of many strongly correlated fermionic systems3. Controllable many-body systems that host Cooper pairs would thus be desirable. Here we directly observe Cooper pairs in a mesoscopic two-dimensional Fermi gas. We apply an imaging scheme that enables us to extract the full in situ momentum distribution of a strongly interacting Fermi gas with single-particle and spin resolution4. Our ultracold gas enables us to freely tune between a completely non-interacting, unpaired system and weak attractions, where we find Cooper pair correlations at the Fermi surface. When increasing the attractive interactions even further, the pairs gradually turn into deeply bound molecules that break up the Fermi surface. Our mesoscopic system is closely related to the physics of nuclei, superconducting grains or quantum dots5-7. With the precise control over the interactions, particle number and potential landscape in our experiment, the observables we establish in this work provide an approach for answering longstanding questions concerning not only such mesoscopic systems but also their connection to the macroscopic world."
https://openalex.org/W4282601617,"Adaptive immune components are thought to exert non-overlapping roles in antimicrobial host defence, with antibodies targeting pathogens in the extracellular environment and T cells eliminating infection inside cells1,2. Reliance on antibodies for vertically transferred immunity from mothers to babies may explain neonatal susceptibility to intracellular infections3,4. Here we show that pregnancy-induced post-translational antibody modification enables protection against the prototypical intracellular pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. Infection susceptibility was reversed in neonatal mice born to preconceptually primed mothers possessing L. monocytogenes-specific IgG or after passive transfer of antibodies from primed pregnant, but not virgin, mice. Although maternal B cells were essential for producing IgGs that mediate vertically transferred protection, they were dispensable for antibody acquisition of protective function, which instead required sialic acid acetyl esterase5 to deacetylate terminal sialic acid residues on IgG variable-region N-linked glycans. Deacetylated L. monocytogenes-specific IgG protected neonates through the sialic acid receptor CD226,7, which suppressed IL-10 production by B cells leading to antibody-mediated protection. Consideration of the maternal-fetal dyad as a joined immunological unit reveals protective roles for antibodies against intracellular infection and fine-tuned adaptations to enhance host defence during pregnancy and early life."
https://openalex.org/W3199610616,"Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) are macroscopic coherent matter waves that have revolutionized quantum science and atomic physics. They are important to quantum simulation1 and sensing2,3, for example, underlying atom interferometers in space4 and ambitious tests of Einstein's equivalence principle5,6. A long-standing constraint for quantum gas devices has been the need to execute cooling stages time-sequentially, restricting these devices to pulsed operation. Here we demonstrate continuous Bose-Einstein condensation by creating a continuous-wave (CW) condensate of strontium atoms that lasts indefinitely. The coherent matter wave is sustained by amplification through Bose-stimulated gain of atoms from a thermal bath. By steadily replenishing this bath while achieving 1,000 times higher phase-space densities than previous works7,8, we maintain the conditions for condensation. Our experiment is the matter wave analogue of a CW optical laser with fully reflective cavity mirrors. This proof-of-principle demonstration provides a new, hitherto missing piece of atom optics, enabling the construction of continuous coherent-matter-wave devices."
https://openalex.org/W4282932154,"Abstract Large-scale human genetic data 1–3 have shown that cancer mutations display strong tissue-selectivity, but how this selectivity arises remains unclear. Here, using experimental models, functional genomics and analyses of patient samples, we demonstrate that the lineage transcription factor paired box 8 (PAX8) is required for oncogenic signalling by two common genetic alterations that cause clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) in humans: the germline variant rs7948643 at 11q13.3 and somatic inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor ( VHL ) 4–6 . VHL loss, which is observed in about 90% of ccRCCs, can lead to hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF2A) stabilization 6,7 . We show that HIF2A is preferentially recruited to PAX8-bound transcriptional enhancers, including a pro-tumorigenic cyclin D1 ( CCND1 ) enhancer that is controlled by PAX8 and HIF2A. The ccRCC-protective allele C at rs7948643 inhibits PAX8 binding at this enhancer and downstream activation of CCND1 expression. Co-option of a PAX8-dependent physiological programme that supports the proliferation of normal renal epithelial cells is also required for MYC expression from the ccRCC metastasis-associated amplicons at 8q21.3-q24.3 (ref. 8 ). These results demonstrate that transcriptional lineage factors are essential for oncogenic signalling and that they mediate tissue-specific cancer risk associated with somatic and inherited genetic variants."

In particular, 3He nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) probes have been proposed as a new standard for absolute magnetometry6,9. This requires a high-accuracy value for the 3He nuclear magnetic moment, which, however, has so far been determined only indirectly and with a relative precision of 12 parts per billon10,11. Here we investigate the 3He+ ground-state hyperfine structure in a Penning trap to directly measure the nuclear g-factor of 3He+ [Formula: see text], the zero-field hyperfine splitting [Formula: see text] Hz and the bound electron g-factor [Formula: see text]. The latter is consistent with our theoretical value [Formula: see text] based on parameters and fundamental constants from ref. 12. Our measured value for the 3He+ nuclear g-factor enables determination of the g-factor of the bare nucleus [Formula: see text] via our accurate calculation of the diamagnetic shielding constant13 [Formula: see text]. This constitutes a direct calibration for 3He NMR probes and an improvement of the precision by one order of magnitude compared to previous indirect results. The measured zero-field hyperfine splitting improves the precision by two orders of magnitude compared to the previous most precise value14 and enables us to determine the Zemach radius15 to [Formula: see text] fm."
https://openalex.org/W4200635289,"The observation of the Higgs boson solidified the standard model of particle physics. However, explanations of anomalies (for example, dark matter) rely on further symmetry breaking, calling for an undiscovered axial Higgs mode1. The Higgs mode was also seen in magnetic, superconducting and charge density wave (CDW) systems2,3. Uncovering the vector properties of a low-energy mode is challenging, and requires going beyond typical spectroscopic or scattering techniques. Here we discover an axial Higgs mode in the CDW system RTe3 using the interference of quantum pathways. In RTe3 (R = La, Gd), the electronic ordering couples bands of equal or different angular momenta4-6. As such, the Raman scattering tensor associated with the Higgs mode contains both symmetric and antisymmetric components, which are excited via two distinct but degenerate pathways. This leads to constructive or destructive interference of these pathways, depending on the choice of the incident and Raman-scattered light polarization. The qualitative behaviour of the Raman spectra is well captured by an appropriate tight-binding model, including an axial Higgs mode. Elucidation of the antisymmetric component is direct evidence that the Higgs mode contains an axial vector representation (that is, a pseudo-angular momentum) and hints that the CDW is unconventional. Thus, we provide a means for measuring quantum properties of collective modes without resorting to extreme experimental conditions."

Our data indicated that the multiepitope S-N-M peptide construct combined with Montanide 720 in homologous regimen significantly stimulated total IgG, IgG2a, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-15, IL-21 and IL-6, and Granzyme B secretion as compared to other groups. Moreover, the pcDNA- s-n-m / LL37 nanoparticles significantly induced higher immune responses than the naked DNA in both homologous and heterologous regimens. In general, our designed multiepitope vaccine construct can be considered as a vaccine candidate in SARS-CoV-2 infection model."
https://openalex.org/W4281688779,"Gait analysis using foot-worn inertial measurement units has proven to be a reliable tool to diagnose and monitor many neurological and musculoskeletal indications. However, only few studies have investigated the robustness of such systems to changes in the sensor attachment and no consensus for suitable sensor positions exists in the research community. Specifically for unsupervised real-world measurements, understanding how the reliability of the monitoring system changes when the sensor is attached differently is from high importance. In these scenarios, placement variations are expected because of user error or personal preferences. In this manuscript, we present the largest study to date comparing different sensor positions and attachments. We recorded 9000 strides with motion-capture reference from 14 healthy participants with six synchronized sensors attached at each foot. Spatial gait parameters were calculated using a double-integration method and compared to the reference system. The results indicate that relevant differences in the accuracy of the stride length exists between the sensor positions. While the average error over multiple strides is comparable, single stride errors and variability parameters differ greatly. We further present a physics model and an analysis of the raw sensor data to understand the origin of the observed differences. This analysis indicates that a variety of attachment parameters can influence the systems' performance. While this is only the starting point to understand and mitigate these types of errors, we conclude that sensor systems and algorithms must be reevaluated when the sensor position or attachment changes."

Using panel data on 31 provinces in China from 2002 to 2017, this paper estimates basic and continuous difference-in-differences (DID) models to investigate the preliminary impact of irrigation and drainage infrastructure and rural transportation infrastructure on poverty and further explores the influence mechanisms of these rural infrastructures on poverty by using the mediating effect model. The results show that irrigation and drainage facilities infrastructure can directly reduce poverty. On the one hand, rural transportation infrastructure directly leads to rural hollowing out and aggravates rural poverty; on the other hand, it indirectly promotes poverty reduction by stimulating economic growth. Overall, the positive and negative effects of rural transportation infrastructure on poverty offset each other."

https://openalex.org/W4285412300,"Prior work indicates a robust relationship between coffee consumption and lower depression risk, yet no research has examined links with psychological well-being (e.g., happiness, optimism). This study tested whether coffee intake is prospectively associated with greater psychological well-being over time. Secondarily, associations in the reverse direction were also examined to determine whether initial levels of psychological well-being were related to subsequent coffee consumption.Among women in the Nurses' Health Study, coffee consumption was examined in 1990 and 2002 in relation to sustained levels of happiness reported across multiple assessments from 1992-2000 (N = 44,449) and sustained levels of optimism assessed from 2004-2012 (N = 36,729). Associations were tested using generalized estimating equations with a Poisson distribution adjusted for various relevant covariates. Bidirectional relationships were evaluated in secondary analyses of baseline happiness (1992) and optimism (2004) with sustained moderate coffee consumption across multiple assessments through 2010.Compared to minimal coffee consumption levels (<1 cup/day), moderate consumption (1-3 cups/day) was unrelated to happiness, whereas heavy consumption (≥4 cups/day) was associated with a 3% lower likelihood of sustained happiness (relative risk, RR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95-0.99). Only moderate coffee consumption was weakly associated with a greater likelihood of sustained optimism (RR1-3cups/day = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.00-1.06). Secondary analyses showed high levels of optimism but not happiness levels were modestly associated with increased likelihood of sustained moderate coffee intake (RRoptimism = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.02-1.10; RRhappiness = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.99-1.04).Associations between psychological well-being and coffee consumption over up to two decades were largely null or weak. Although coffee consumption may protect individuals against depression over time, it may have limited impact on facets of psychological well-being."
https://openalex.org/W4285505679,"During the COVID-19 pandemic authorities have been striving to obtain reliable predictions for the spreading dynamics of the disease. We recently developed a multi-""sub-populations"" (multi-compartments: susceptible, exposed, pre-symptomatic, infectious, recovered) model, that accounts for the spatial in-homogeneous spreading of the infection and shown, for a variety of examples, how the epidemic curves are highly sensitive to location of epicenters, non-uniform population density, and local restrictions. In the present work we test our model against real-life data from South Carolina during the period May 22 to July 22 (2020). During this period, minimal restrictions have been employed, which allowed us to assume that the local basic reproduction number is constant in time. We account for the non-uniform population density in South Carolina using data from NASA's Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC), and predict the evolution of infection heat-maps during the studied period. Comparing the predicted heat-maps with those observed, we find high qualitative resemblance. Moreover, the Pearson's correlation coefficient is relatively high thus validating our model against real-world data. We conclude that the model accounts for the major effects controlling spatial in-homogeneous spreading of the disease. Inclusion of additional sub-populations (compartments), in the spirit of several recently developed models for COVID-19, can be easily performed within our mathematical framework."
https://openalex.org/W4285505974,"Although mRNA-based vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 induce a robust immune response and prevent infections and hospitalizations, there are limited data on the antibody response in individuals with humoral immunodeficiency. The aim of this study was to evaluate the humoral immune response after two vaccine doses with BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 in patients with humoral immunodeficiency disease.This cross-sectional study assessed 39 individuals with hypogammaglobulinemia under immunoglobulin replacement therapy. IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibodies (anti-S) were measured 4 weeks to 4 months after two doses of an mRNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2. The proportion of patients, who developed a humoral immune response to the spike protein were evaluated and compared to 19 healthy controls.After vaccination with two vaccine doses, 26/39 patients (66.7%) with humoral immunodeficiency disease and all healthy controls developed anti-S. In subjects with baseline IgG <3 g/l, only 1/5 (20%) showed a humoral immune response. 10 out of 26 with CVID (38.5%) and 7/9 under immunosuppressive drugs (77.8%) developed no immune response (13 subjects with no response) compared to 0/19 in healthy controls. Subgroup analysis in patients without immunosuppressive drugs revealed lower anti-S in patients with moderate to severe humoral immunodeficiency disease: baseline IgG <3 g/l: 12.0 AU/ml (95%CI 12.0-125.0), baseline IgG 3-5 g/l: 99.9 AU/ml (95%CI 14.4-400.0), baseline IgG >5 g/l: 151.5 AU/ml (95%CI 109.0-400.0), healthy controls 250.0 AU/ml (95%CI 209.0-358.0), p = 0.007.In most patients with mild to moderate humoral immunodeficiency we found only slightly lower anti-S antibodies compared with healthy controls after two vaccine doses with BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273. However, in patients with a decreased baseline IgG below 3 g/l and/or under immunosuppressive drugs, we found severely impaired humoral immune responses."

https://openalex.org/W4281811798,"Male sex and advanced age are associated with severe symptoms of COVID-19. Sex and age also exhibit substantial associations with genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm) differences in humans. Using a random sample of Illumina EPIC-based genome-wide methylomes from peripheral whole blood of 1,976 parents, participating in The Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), we explored whether DNAm in genes linked to SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and to severe COVID-19 were associated with sex and age. This was carried out by testing 1,572 DNAm sites (CpGs) located near 45 genes for associations with age and sex. We found that DNAm in 281 and 231 of 1,572 CpGs were associated (pFDR<0.01) with sex and aging, respectively. CpGs linked to SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry genes were all associated with age and sex, except for the ACE2 receptor gene (located on the X-chromosome), which was only associated with sex (pFDR<0.01). Furthermore, we examined whether 1,487 autosomal CpGs associated with host-cell entry and severe COVID-19 were more or less associated with sex and age than what would be expected from the same number of randomly sampled genome-wide CpGs. We found that the CpGs associated with host-cell entry and severe COVID-19 were not more or less associated with sex (R2 = 0.77, p = 0.09) than the CpGs sampled from random genomic regions; age was actually found to be significantly less so (R2 = 0.36, p = 0.04). Hence, while we found wide-spread associations between sex and age at CpGs linked to genes implicated with SARS-CoV-2 host cell entry and severe COVID-19, the effect from the sum of these CpGs was not stronger than that from randomly sampled CpGs; for age it was significantly less so. These findings could suggest that advanced age and male sex may not be unsurmountable barriers for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to evolve increased infectiousness."

PCSC in women, related to prenatal care and childbirth, and in children under two years old, from 2008 to 2019 were used to characterize trends and formations of spatiotemporal clusters/outliers. Crude PCSC rates were calculated and adjusted by the local empirical Bayesian method, presented in choropleth maps. We also used Anselin Local Moran I type analyses to identify spatial clusters, and space-time cube with clustering by emerging hotspot, followed by time series clustering, for analysis of spatiotemporal trends (alpha = 5%).A total of 1,850,776 PCSC were registered in pregnant women, puerperae, and children under two years of age in Brazil, representing 1.7% of the total number of hospital admissions in the period. PCSC rates showed different behaviors when the groups of women and children were evaluated, with a predominant growing trend of 109% in admissions in the first group and a reduction of 34.4% in the second. The North, Northeast, and Midwest regions had larger high-risk clusters and more significant increasing trends in PCSC in the two subpopulations studied.Health actions and services in primary care may be reducing hospital admissions for children, but they are not being effective in reducing hospital admissions for women for causes related to prenatal care and childbirth, especially in the North, Northeast, and Midwest of Brazil.

https://openalex.org/W4281738216,"The migration timing of Pacific salmon in the Columbia River basin is subject to multiple influences related to climate, human water resource management, and lagged effects such as oceanic conditions. We apply an information theory-based approach to analyze drivers of adult Chinook salmon migration within the spring and fall spawning seasons and between years based on salmon counts at dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers. Time-lagged mutual information and information decomposition measures, which characterize lagged and nonlinear dependencies as reductions in uncertainty, are used to detect interactions between salmon counts and lagged streamflows, air and water temperatures, precipitation, snowpack, climate indices and downstream salmon counts. At a daily timescale, these interdependencies reflect migration timing and show differences between fall and spring run salmon, while dependencies based on variables at an annual resolution reflect long-term predictability. We also highlight several types of joint dependencies where predictability of salmon counts depends on the knowledge of multiple lagged sources. This study illustrates how co-varying human and natural drivers could propagate to influence salmon migration timing or overall returns, and how nonlinear types of dependencies between variables enhance predictability of a target. This information-based framework is broadly applicable to assess driving factors in other types of complex water resources systems or species life cycles."
https://openalex.org/W4281740994,"Background &amp; objective Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FHeH) is important risk factor for premature coronary artery disease (CAD). Strategies for its diagnosis and prevalence have not been well studied in India. We performed healthcare worker-based opportunistic screening to assess feasibility for determining its prevalence. Methods A healthcare worker was trained in use of Dutch Lipid Clinic Network (DLCN) criteria for diagnosis of FHeH. Successive eligible individuals (n = 3000 of 3450 screened) presenting to biochemistry laboratories of two hospitals for blood lipid measurements were evaluated for FHeH. Cascade screening or genetic studies were not performed. Descriptive statistics are reported. Results We included 2549 participants (men 1870, women 679) not on statin therapy. Health worker screened 25–30 individuals/day in 6–10 minutes each. The mean age was 46.2±11y. Variables of DLCN criteria were more in women vs men: family history 51.1 vs 35.6%, past CAD 48.2 vs 20.1%, arcus cornealis 1.1 vs 0.3%, tendon xanthoma 0.3 vs 0.1%, and LDL cholesterol 190–249 mg/dl in 8.5 vs 2.4%, 250–329 mg/dl in 0.7 vs 0% and ≥330 mg/dl in 0.3 vs 0% (p&lt;0.01). Definite FHeH (DLCN score &gt;8) was in 15 (0.59%, frequency 1:170) and probable FHeH (score 6–8) in 87 (3.4%, frequency 1:29). The prevalence was significantly greater in women, age &lt;50y and in those with hypertension, diabetes and known CAD. Conclusions Healthcare worker-led opportunistic screening for diagnosis of FHeH using DLCN criteria is feasible in low-resource settings. The results show significant prevalence of clinically detected definite and probable FHeH in the population studied."

However, the participation of and adherence to these programs in real life situation is generally low.To test the feasibility of a transitionally organized fall prevention assessment with accompanying personalized intervention initiated at the ED.A process evaluation, of a non-randomized controlled pilot trial for implementing a transitionally organized multifactorial fall prevention intervention, was performed using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to gain insight into the barriers and facilitators of implementation. Older fallers (>70yrs) presenting at the ED were selected based on ZIP-code and after obtaining informed consent, data for the evaluation was collected through questionnaires and interviews. Furthermore, feedback was collected from the healthcare providers.The consent was obtained by 24 (70%) of the patients approached directly at the ED and 17 (26%) of the patients approached later by phone. Adherence to the protocol by the participants, clinical assessors and family practice were all more than 90%. After three months, nine (26%) of the participants had at least one recurrent fall: three (20%) patients in the intervention group and six (32%) in the control group.ED presentation due to a fall in older persons provides a window of opportunity for optimizing adherence to a multifactorial fall prevention program as willingness to participate was higher when the patients were approached at the ED during their stay. Implementing a transitionally organized multidisciplinary fall prevention program was successful with a high protocol adherence.NTR NL8142, November 8, 2019."

Despite this evidence, to date it remains unclear whether optimism has positive or negative implications for entrepreneurial activities. We examine this question in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, which provides a unique way to study the role of optimism on the (in)ability of firms to overcome exogenous shocks. Using a large-scale longitudinal survey covering 1,632 UK firms, we find that entrepreneurs who score high on optimism were more likely to innovate and make organizational changes to their firms during the Covid-19 outbreak. Moreover, optimistic entrepreneurs experienced higher revenue growth during the pandemic. Collectively, our study sheds light on one of the psychological factors explaining why some firms can prosper and some others struggle in the wake of an external shock."
https://openalex.org/W4282009584,"Since its inception in the mid-eighties, the field of construction grammar has been steadily growing and constructionist approaches to language have by now become a mainstream paradigm for linguistic research. While the construction grammar community has traditionally focused on theoretical, experimental and corpus-based research, the importance of computational methodologies is now rapidly increasing. This movement has led to the establishment of a number of exploratory computational construction grammar formalisms, which facilitate the implementation of construction grammars, as well as their use for language processing purposes. Yet, implementing large grammars using these formalisms still remains a challenging task, partly due to a lack of powerful and user-friendly tools for computational construction grammar engineering. In order to overcome this obstacle, this paper introduces the FCG Editor, a dedicated and innovative integrated development environment for the Fluid Construction Grammar formalism. Offering a straightforward installation and a user-friendly, interactive interface, the FCG Editor is an accessible, yet powerful tool for construction grammarians who wish to operationalise their construction grammar insights and analyses in order to computationally verify them, corroborate them with corpus data, or integrate them in language technology applications."
https://openalex.org/W4285506251,"Austria is inhabited by more than 80 species of native and non-native freshwater fishes. Despite considerable knowledge about Austrian fish species, the latest Red List of threatened species dates back 15 years and a systematic genetic inventory of Austria’s fish species does not exist. To fulfill this deficit, we employed DNA barcoding to generate an up-to-date and comprehensive genetic reference database for Austrian fish species. In total, 639 newly generated cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 ( COI ) sequences were added to the 377 existing records from the BOLD data base, to compile a near complete reference dataset. Standard sequence similarity analyses resulted in 83 distinct clusters almost perfectly reflecting the expected number of species in Austria. Mean intraspecific distances of 0.22% were significantly lower than distances to closest relatives, resulting in a pronounced barcoding gap and unique Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) for most of the species. Four cases of BIN sharing were detected, pointing to hybridization and/or recent divergence, whereas in Phoxinus spp., Gobio spp. and Barbatula barbatula intraspecific splits, multiple BINs and consequently cryptic diversity were observed. The overall high identification success and clear genetic separation of most of the species confirms the applicability and accuracy of genetic methods for bio-surveillance. Furthermore, the new DNA barcoding data pinpoints cases of taxonomic uncertainty, which need to be addressed in further detail, to more precisely assort genetic lineages and their local distribution ranges in a new National Red-List."

We conducted a study which aimed to identify factors influencing timely health care seeking and choice of first source of health care in Ethiopia.A total of 535 caregivers who sought health care for febrile children aged under 5 years at a tertiary hospital, and one urban and two rural health centres in Hawassa, southern Ethiopia were recruited to participate in the study from August to November 2019. Caregivers were interviewed using pretested structured questionnaires on socio-demographic and clinical factors to identify associations with health care seeking practice and first source of care, and reasons for particular practices. Delayed care seeking was defined as seeking care from a health facility after 24 hours of onset of fever.Of 535 caregivers who participated, 271 (50.7%) had sought timely health care; 400 (74.8%) utilized a primary health care (PHC) facility as first source; and 282 (52.7%) bypassed the nearest PHC facility. Rural residents (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.85; 95% CI 1.11-3.09), and those who reported cough (AOR 1.87; 95% CI 1.20-2.93) as a reason for consultation were more likely to delay seeking health care. While caregivers were less likely delayed for children aged 24-35 months (AOR 0.50; 95% CI 0.28-0.87) compared to infants. Utilizing higher-level hospitals as the first source of care was less frequent among rural residents (AOR 0.15; 95% CI 0.06-0.39) and in those with no formal education (AOR 0.03; 95% CI 0.01-0.27). Those having a longer travel time to the provider (AOR 2.11; 95% CI 1.09-4.08) more likely utilized higher hospitals.We identified a need to improve timely health seeking among rural residents, infants, and those presenting with respiratory symptoms.

https://openalex.org/W4281661859,"Coral reefs are facing increasingly devasting impacts from ocean warming and acidification due to anthropogenic climate change. In addition to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, potential solutions have focused either on reducing light stress during heating, or on the potential for identifying or engineering “super corals”. A large subset of these studies, however, have tended to focus primarily on the bleaching response of corals, and assume erroneously that corals that bleach earlier in a thermal event die first. Here, we explore how survival, observable bleaching, coral skeletal growth (as branch extension and densification), and coral tissue growth (protein and lipid concentrations) varies for conspecifics collected from distinctive reef zones at Heron Island on the Southern Great Barrier Reef. A reciprocal transplantation experiment was undertaken using the dominant reef building coral ( Acropora formosa) between the highly variable reef flat and the less variable reef slope environments. Coral colonies originating from the reef flat had higher rates of survival and amassed greater protein densities but calcified at reduced rates compared to conspecifics originating from the reef slope. The energetics of both populations however potentially benefited from greater light intensity present in the shallows. Reef flat origin corals moved to the lower light intensity of the reef slope reduced protein density and calcification rates. For A . formosa , genetic differences, or long-term entrainment to a highly variable environment, appeared to promote coral survival at the expense of calcification. The response decouples coral survival from carbonate coral reef resilience, a response that was further exacerbated by reductions in irradiance. As we begin to discuss interventions necessitated by the CO 2 that has already been released into the atmosphere, we need to prioritise our focus on the properties that maintain valuable carbonate ecosystems. Rapid and dense calcification by corals such as branching Acropora is essential to the ability of carbonate coral reefs to rebound following disturbance events and maintain 3D structure but may be the first property that is sacrificed to enable coral genet survival under stress."

This might be even more important among adolescents, who are less endangered by the virus but contribute to its spread. In this article, we focus on adolescent boys' and girls' agency and communion orientations to explain the level of importance they attribute to the instituted measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus (personal norm), as well as their behavioral adherence to those measures. In total, 12,552 adolescents (67.6% girls, Mage = 15.06, SDage = 2.44, age range 10-21) answered inventory assessing adolescents' agentic and communal orientation (GRI-JUG) and items related to personal norm regarding the instituted measures and behavioral adherence to the measures. The results showed a small positive role of communion in both boys' and girls' personal norm and behavioral adherence, whereas agency played a very small negative role in boys' and girls' personal norm and boys' behavioral adherence to measures. Nevertheless, these findings could indicate the importance of enhancing communal traits and behaviors in both genders in order to assure socially responsible behavior during the pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W4281778596,"When naming a sequence of pictures of the same semantic category (e.g., furniture ), response latencies systematically increase with each named category member. This cumulative semantic interference effect has become a popular tool to investigate the cognitive architecture of language production. However, not all processes underlying the effect itself are fully understood, including the question where the effect originates from. While some researchers assume the interface of the conceptual and lexical level as its origin, others suggest the conceptual-semantic level. The latter assumption follows from the observation that cumulative effects, namely cumulative facilitation, can also be observed in purely conceptual-semantic tasks. Another unanswered question is whether cumulative interference is affected by the morphological complexity of the experimental targets. In two experiments with the same participants and the same material, we investigated both of these issues. Experiment 1, a continuous picture naming task, investigated whether morphologically complex nouns (e.g., kitchen table ) elicit identical levels of cumulative interference to morphologically simple nouns (e.g., table ). Our results show this to be the case, indicating that cumulative interference is unaffected by lexical information such as morphological complexity. In Experiment 2, participants classified the same target objects as either man-made or natural. As expected, we observed cumulative facilitation. A separate analysis showed that this facilitation effect can be predicted by the individuals’ effect sizes of cumulative interference, suggesting a strong functional link between the two effects. Our results thus point to a conceptual-semantic origin of cumulative semantic interference."

In this timeframe, a national guideline about aspirin in pregnancy was introduced by the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology. Materials and methods A national online survey among Dutch gynecologists and residents was performed. An online questionnaire was distributed among the members of the Dutch Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology in April 2016 and April 2021. Main outcome measure was the proportion of gynecologists indicating prescription of aspirin in pregnancy for high and moderate risk indications. Results In 2016, 133 respondents completed the survey, and in 2021 231. For all indications mentioned in the guideline there was an increase in prescribing aspirin in 2021 in comparison to 2016. More specifically, the percentage of gynecologists prescribing aspirin for a history of preeclampsia before 34 weeks, between 34 and 37 weeks and at term increased from respectively 94% to 100%, 39% to 98%, and 15% to 97%. Consultant obstetricians and respondents working in an university hospital did not more often indicate the prescription of aspirin for tertiary care indications in 2021. Future use of a prediction model was suggested in the narrative comments. Conclusion Implementation of aspirin in pregnancy among Dutch gynecologists substantially improved after a five year timeframe in which the national guideline on aspirin during pregnancy was introduced and trials confirming the effect of aspirin were published."

While chondrogenic differentiation of canine multipotent stromal cells (cMSCs) has been reported using the classic micromass technique, cMSCs respond inconsistently to this method. The objectives of this study were to develop a three-dimensional (3D), serum-free, Collagen Type I system to facilitate cMSC chondrogenesis and, once established, to determine the effect of chondrogenic growth factors on cMSC chondrogenesis. Canine MSCs were polymerized in 100 μL Collagen Type I gels (5 mg/mL) at 1 x 10 6 cells/construct. Constructs were assessed using morphometry, live/dead staining, and histology in 10 various chondrogenic media. Four media were selected for additional in-depth analyses via lactate dehydrogenase release, total glycosaminoglycan content, qPCR ( COL1A1 , COL2A , SOX9 , ACAN , BGLAP and SP7 ), immunofluorescence, and TUNEL staining. In the presence of dexamethasone and transforming growth factor-β3 (TGF-β3), both bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP-2) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) generated larger chondrogenic constructs, although BMP-2 was required to achieve histologic characteristics of chondrocytes. Chondrogenic medium containing dexamethasone, TGF-β3, BMP-2 and bFGF led to a significant decrease in lactate dehydrogenase release at day 3 and glycosaminoglycan content was significantly increased in these constructs at day 3, 10, and 21. Both osteogenic and chondrogenic transcripts were induced in response to dexamethasone, TGF-β3, BMP-2 and bFGF. Collagen Type II and X were detected in all groups via immunofluorescence. Finally, TUNEL staining was positive in constructs lacking BMP-2 or bFGF. In conclusion, the 3D, serum-free, Collagen Type-I assay described herein proved useful in assessing cMSC differentiation and will serve as a productive system to characterize cMSCs or to fabricate tissue engineering constructs for clinical use."
