https://openalex.org/W2055136488,"THE dependence of the melting point of small solid particles on their size is implicit in the work of J. J. Thomson1 on the effect of size on phase equilibria. It has been shown that large depressions of melting point are found when the diameters of the particles are about 20 nm. Takagi2 and Blackman and Curzon3 used electron diffraction techniques to study the melting of such small particles. The particle sizes in the latter case were determined by electron microscopy. Further systematic studies have been carried out by Wronski4 with tin, and by C. J. Coombes (private communication) on lead (see also refs. 5–7)."

The imaginary part of the index of refraction of diamond increases sharply from near zero to about 1.0 at λ−1 = 5.0 µm−1, giving an albedo near unity in the visible and strong extinction in the ultraviolet, as required by recent observations."

https://openalex.org/W2143883339,"PACZYNSKI has shown in some unpublished work that all stars in the interval 3.5 M⊙≲M≲8 M⊙ form degenerate carbon–oxygen cores (M ∼ 1.4 M⊙) which converge to the same central conditions before undergoing carbon ignition. The luminosities of these stars also converge, indicating that their cores are all essentially identical. Gunn and Ostriker (unpublished) have shown that the minimum mass for pulsar parent stars is about 4 M⊙ with a maximum parent mass of about 10 M⊙. Their study also indicates that the parameter B = Bia3 sin αI−1/2 (Bi is the initial magnetic field, a is the neutron star radius, α is the angle of inclination between the rotation and dipole axes, and I is the moment of inertia) varies only slightly among the fourteen pulsars the period of which has been observed to change, and for which B can thus be determined."
