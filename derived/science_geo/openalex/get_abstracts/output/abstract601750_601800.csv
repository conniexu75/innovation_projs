https://openalex.org/W2780484649,"Pointing to a second critical point One explanation for the divergence of many of the thermodynamic properties of water is that there is a critical point in deeply supercooled water at some positive pressure. For bulk water samples, these conditions are described as “no man's land,” because ice nucleates before such temperatures can be reached. Kim et al. used femtosecond x-ray laser pulses to probe micrometer-sized water droplets cooled to 227 K (see the Perspective by Gallo and Stanley). The temperature dependence of the isothermal compressibility and correlation length extracted from x-ray scattering functions showed maxima at 229 K for H 2 O and 233 K for D 2 O, rather than diverging to infinity. These results point to the existence of the Widom line, a locus of maximum correlation lengths emanating from a critical point in the supercooled regime.

https://openalex.org/W2778754068,"Distinct subtypes of inhibitory interneuron are known to shape diverse rhythmic activities in the cortex, but how they interact to orchestrate specific band activity remains largely unknown. By recording optogenetically tagged interneurons of specific subtypes in the primary visual cortex of behaving mice, we show that spiking of somatostatin (SOM)- and parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons preferentially correlates with cortical beta and gamma band oscillations, respectively. Suppression of SOM cell spiking reduces the spontaneous low-frequency band (<30-Hz) oscillations and selectively reduces visually induced enhancement of beta oscillation. In comparison, suppressing PV cell activity elevates the synchronization of spontaneous activity across a broad frequency range and further precludes visually induced changes in beta and gamma oscillations. Rhythmic activation of SOM and PV cells in the local circuit entrains resonant activity in the narrow 5- to 30-Hz band and the wide 20- to 80-Hz band, respectively. Together, these findings reveal differential and cooperative roles of SOM and PV inhibitory neurons in orchestrating specific cortical oscillations."

https://openalex.org/W2770682151,"Brain aging and neurodegeneration are associated with prominent microglial reactivity and activation of innate immune response pathways, commonly referred to as neuroinflammation. One such pathway, the type I interferon response, recognizes viral or mitochondrial DNA in the cytoplasm via activation of the recently discovered cyclic dinucleotide synthetase cGAS and the cyclic dinucleotide receptor STING. Here we show that the FDA-approved antiviral drug ganciclovir (GCV) induces a type I interferon response independent of its canonical thymidine kinase target. Inhibition of components of the STING pathway, including STING, IRF3, Tbk1, extracellular IFNβ, and the Jak-Stat pathway resulted in reduced activity of GCV and its derivatives. Importantly, functional STING was necessary for GCV to inhibit inflammation in cultured myeloid cells and in a mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Collectively, our findings uncover an unexpected new activity of GCV and identify the STING pathway as a regulator of microglial reactivity and neuroinflammation."

These findings reveal a distributed thirst circuit that motivates drinking by the common mechanism of drive reduction. Eating and drinking are fundamental motivated behaviors, but how the brain transforms the need for food or water into a specific motivational drive remains poorly understood. Traditionally, two broad classes of mechanisms have been proposed to motivate behavior (Berridge, 2004Berridge K.C. Motivation concepts in behavioral neuroscience.Physiol. Behav. 2004; 81: 179-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The first involves the ability of food or water deprivation to magnify the rewarding properties of eating or drinking and thereby positively reinforce these behaviors. This is the mechanism that makes food taste more delicious when you are hungry, a phenomenon known as alliesthesia (Cabanac, 1971Cabanac M. Physiological role of pleasure.Science. 1971; 173: 1103-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar, Toates, 1986Toates F.M. Motivational Systems. Cambridge University Press, 1986Google Scholar). On the other hand, food and water deprivation are experienced as intrinsically unpleasant states, and therefore, animals will perform work simply to avoid these aversive conditions, a mechanism known as negative reinforcement or drive reduction (Hull, 1943Hull C.L. Principles of Behavior: An Introduction to Behavior Theory. Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1943Google Scholar, Spence, 1956Spence K.W. Behavior Theory & Conditioning. Yale University Press, 1956Crossref Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, these two processes are thought to work together to motivate behavior, but it remains unknown how they are each instantiated in the brain at the level of specific neural circuits. For the control of drinking behavior, the critical neurons that sense and respond to changes in internal state are located within three small, interconnected forebrain nuclei known collectively as the lamina terminalis (LT). These structures include the subfornical organ (SFO) and organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT), which are situated outside the blood-brain barrier and contain interoceptive neurons that monitor the blood directly (McKinley et al., 2003McKinley M.J. McAllen R.M. Davern P. Giles M.E. Penschow J. Sunn N. Uschakov A. Oldfield B.J. The sensory circumventricular organs of the mammalian brain.Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 2003; 172 (III–XII, 1–122, back cover)PubMed Google Scholar), and the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO), which is thought to function as a downstream integratory site (McKinley et al., 2015McKinley M.J. Yao S.T. Uschakov A. McAllen R.M. Rundgren M. Martelli D. The median preoptic nucleus: front and centre for the regulation of body fluid, sodium, temperature, sleep and cardiovascular homeostasis.Acta Physiol. (Oxf.). 2015; 214: 8-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). When the blood volume falls or osmolarity rises, neurons within these three nuclei become activated, thereby triggering thirst, salt appetite, and an array of autonomic and neuroendocrine outputs that function to restore fluid balance (Bourque, 2008Bourque C.W.

Given its preeminent role in the control of drinking behavior, the LT represents a logical starting point for investigation of the motivational processes underlying thirst. However, this investigation has been complicated by the fact that each structure within the LT is neurochemically heterogeneous, and the specific cell types that control drinking in the OVLT and MnPO have not been fully characterized (Abbott et al., 2016Abbott S.B.G.

In the SFO, a population of glutamatergic neurons defined by expression of the genes Nos1, Etv1, and Camk2 (SFOGLUT neurons) are activated during thirst and are necessary and sufficient for drinking behavior (Betley et al., 2015Betley J.N. Xu S. Cao Z.F.H. Gong R. Magnus C.J. Yu Y. Sternson S.M.

Thirst neurons anticipate the homeostatic consequences of eating and drinking.Nature. 2016; 537: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Furthermore, stimulation of SFOGLUT neurons has negative valence (Betley et al., 2015Betley J.N. Xu S. Cao Z.F.H. Gong R. Magnus C.J. Yu Y. Sternson S.M. Neurons for hunger and thirst transmit a negative-valence teaching signal.Nature. 2015; 521: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, it remains unclear whether this negative-valence signal is the mechanism by which SFOGLUT neurons motivate behavior, because it has not been demonstrated that animals will perform work to shut off this signal, which is the hallmark of negative-reinforcement learning (Teitelbaum, 1966Teitelbaum P. The use of operant methods in the assessment and control of motivational states.in: Honig W.K. Operant Behavior: Areas of Research & Application. Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1966: 565-608Google Scholar). To address these questions, we have systematically investigated the cells, pathways, and motivational mechanisms by which the forebrain thirst circuit generates drinking behavior. We first targeted channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) to SFOGLUT neurons and implanted an optical fiber above the SFO (Figure 1A). As previously reported, photostimulation of SFOGLUT neurons triggered voracious and specific water consumption (Figures 1B and 1C) (Betley et al., 2015Betley J.N. Xu S. Cao Z.F.H. Gong R. Magnus C.J. Yu Y. Sternson S.M. Neurons for hunger and thirst transmit a negative-valence teaching signal.Nature. 2015; 521: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, Oka et al., 2015Oka Y. Ye M. Zuker C.S. Thirst driving and suppressing signals encoded by distinct neural populations in the brain.Nature. 2015; 520: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, Zimmerman et al., 2016Zimmerman C.A. Lin Y.-C. Leib D.E. Guo L. Huey E.L. Daly G.E. Chen Y. Knight Z.A. Thirst neurons anticipate the homeostatic consequences of eating and drinking.Nature. 2016; 537: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Photostimulation of SFOGLUT neurons also triggered a rapid and reversible increase in blood pressure (Figure 1D; Figure S1), which likely functions to increase blood circulation in response to acute drops in blood volume (Mangiapane and Simpson, 1980Mangiapane M.L. Simpson J.B. Subfornical organ: forebrain site of pressor and dipsogenic action of angiotensin II.Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: R382-R389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that glutamatergic neurons in the SFO coordinate both the behavioral and the autonomic responses to fluid imbalance. We next trained mice with daily sessions in which they were exposed to tonic photostimulation while given access to two levers, one of which induced a pause in photostimulation and the other of which was inactive (Figure 1E). After training in this negative-reinforcement paradigm, mice expressing ChR2 in SFOGLUT neurons preferentially pressed the active lever to pause photostimulation (Figure 1E). In contrast, control mice expressing GFP in SFOGLUT neurons showed no response to photostimulation in any assay. These data demonstrate that mice will perform instrumental responses to reduce SFOGLUT neuron activity and therefore that the activity of these neurons is negatively reinforcing. The SFO drives thirst via projections to two other LT structures, the OVLT and MnPO (Matsuda et al., 2017Matsuda T. Hiyama T.Y. Niimura F. Matsusaka T. Fukamizu A. Kobayashi K. Kobayashi K. Noda M. Distinct neural mechanisms for the control of thirst and salt appetite in the subfornical organ.Nat. Neurosci. 2017; 20: 230-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, Zimmerman et al., 2016Zimmerman C.A. Lin Y.-C. Leib D.E. Guo L. Huey E.L. Daly G.E. Chen Y. Knight Z.A. Thirst neurons anticipate the homeostatic consequences of eating and drinking.Nature. 2016; 537: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). To test whether SFOGLUT neurons transmit a negative-reinforcement signal to these downstream sites, we targeted ChR2 to SFOGLUT neurons and implanted an optical fiber above the MnPO (Figure 1F). This fiber placement results in stimulation of axons innervating the MnPO as well as fibers of passage targeting the OVLT. We first confirmed that photostimulation of SFOGLUT→MnPO/OVLT axons drives robust and specific water consumption (Figures 1G and 1H) and elevates blood pressure (Figure 1I) to an extent comparable to stimulation of SFOGLUT neuron somas. We then trained these mice in the negative-reinforcement paradigm described above, which revealed that mice will robustly lever press to prevent photostimulation of SFOGLUT→MnPO/OVLT projections (Figure 1J). Thus, projections from SFOGLUT neurons to the OVLT and/or MnPO relay a negative-reinforcement signal that corresponds with the ability of these projections to drive drinking. The OVLT and MnPO were first implicated in the control of drinking behavior decades ago (Buggy and Jonhson, 1977Buggy J. Jonhson A.K. Preoptic-hypothalamic periventricular lesions: thirst deficits and hypernatremia.Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: R44-R52PubMed Google Scholar), but the molecular identity of thirst-promoting neurons in these structures has remained unclear (Zimmerman et al., 2017Zimmerman C.A. Leib D.E. Knight Z.A. Neural circuits underlying thirst and fluid homeostasis.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 18: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We first focused on the OVLT, which, like the SFO, lies outside the blood-brain barrier and therefore has unfettered access to circulating signals that stimulate thirst. The angiotensin 1A receptor (encoded by the Agtr1a gene) is expressed in the OVLT (Gonzalez et al., 2012Gonzalez A.D. Wang G. Waters E.M. Gonzales K.L. Speth R.C. Van Kempen T.A. Marques-Lopes J. Young C.N. Butler S.D.

Neuroendocrinol. 1997; 18: 383-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar) and is involved in the control of drinking behavior (Crews and Rowland, 2005Crews E.C. Rowland N.E. Role of angiotensin in body fluid homeostasis of mice: effect of losartan on water and NaCl intakes.Am. J. Physiol. Regul. Integr. Comp. Physiol. 2005; 288: R638-R644Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We used an Agtr1a-GFP reporter line (Gonzalez et al., 2012Gonzalez A.D. Wang G. Waters E.M. Gonzales K.L. Speth R.C. Van Kempen T.A. Marques-Lopes J. Young C.N. Butler S.D. Davisson R.L. et al.Distribution of angiotensin type 1a receptor-containing cells in the brains of bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mice.Neuroscience. 2012; 226: 489-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) to examine whether OVLTAgtr1a neurons are activated by salt challenge (350 μL intraperitoneal injection of 2 M NaCl), a stimulus that rapidly increases plasma osmolarity and robustly triggers thirst (Figure 2A). This revealed extensive (70% ± 3% Fos+ neurons were GFP+) and specific (64% ± 7% GFP+ neurons were Fos+) co-localization between Fos induced by salt challenge and Agtr1a-GFP, suggesting that the Agtr1a gene may label thirst-promoting neurons in the OVLT. To gain genetic access to these cells, we generated a knockin mouse line that expresses Cre recombinase in frame with the endogenous Agtr1a gene (Agtr1a-2A-Cre mice; Figure 2B; Figure S2). Crossing this knockin line to a Cre-dependent GFP reporter line revealed recombination that was remarkably specifically localized to the OVLT relative to adjacent structures (Figure 2C; Figure S2). Neurochemical characterization by in situ hybridization revealed that OVLTAgtr1a neurons primarily express Vglut2 (Slc17a6), but not Vgat (Slc32a1), indicating that these cells are predominantly glutamatergic (Figure 2J; see Figure S2 for additional discussion). Thus, the Agtr1a-2A-Cre mouse line provides genetic access to a specific population of OVLT neurons that are activated during thirst. We next targeted ChR2 to OVLTAgtr1a neurons and positioned an optical fiber above the OVLT. Photostimulation of these cells induced robust water intake that was time-locked to the onset of stimulation (Figure 2D), specific to water relative to hypertonic NaCl (Figures 2E and 2F) and food (Figure S2), and absent from control mice. Photostimulation also caused a rapid and reversible increase in blood pressure (Figure 2G; Figure S2). These data indicate that OVLTAgtr1a neurons are sufficient to trigger the homeostatic responses to fluid imbalance. We next investigated the motivational mechanisms by which OVLTAgtr1a neurons drive drinking behavior. We first trained mice to perform a fixed ratio 3 (FR3) task, in which delivery of each drop of water requires three presses of an active lever (Figure 2H). Photostimulation of OVLTAgtr1a neurons caused otherwise water-sated mice to vigorously and preferentially press the active lever to receive water (Figure 2H). Thus, stimulation of OVLTAgtr1a neurons drives instrumental responding for water, indicating that these cells promote drinking through a specific change in motivational state rather than through a general enhancement of activity or ingestive behavior. We then trained mice in the negative-reinforcement paradigm described above, which revealed that mice will selectively lever press to prevent photostimulation of OVLTAgtr1a neurons (Figure 2I). Thus, OVLTAgtr1a neurons, like SFOGLUT neurons, are activated by deviations from fluid homeostasis, are sufficient to generate robust thirst and cardiovascular responses, and motivate instrumental responding via negative reinforcement. Signals from the SFO and OVLT are thought to converge on the MnPO (Bourque, 2008Bourque C.W. Central mechanisms of osmosensation and systemic osmoregulation.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 9: 519-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar, McKinley et al., 2015McKinley M.J. Yao S.T. Uschakov A. McAllen R.M. Rundgren M. Martelli D.

Neurosci. 2017; 18: 459-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To identify the MnPO neurons that control drinking behavior, we first identified several genes enriched in the MnPO relative to adjacent structures (including Adcyap1, Agtr1a, and Slc17a6) and then measured co-localization between these candidate markers and Fos induced by salt challenge (Figure 3A). This revealed that most Fos+ MnPO neurons express Adcyap1 (81% ± 3%) and, conversely, that most Adcyap1+ neurons express salt challenge-induced Fos (60% ± 4%). A similar, but somewhat lesser, degree of co-localization was observed between Fos and the markers Agtr1a and Slc17a6 (Figure 3A). Consistent with these results, we found that most MnPOAdcyap1 neurons express Slc17a6 (Vglut2), but not Slc32a1 (Vgat), indicating that these cells are predominantly glutamatergic (Figure 3B). These findings are supported by recent single-cell RNA sequencing data showing that Adcyap1, Agtr1a, and Slc17a6 are all enriched in MnPO neurons that express Fos in response to dehydration (Allen et al., 2017Allen W.E. DeNardo L.A. Chen M.Z. Liu C.D. Loh K.M. Fenno L.E. Ramakrishnan C. Deisseroth K. Luo L. Thirst-associated preoptic neurons encode an aversive motivational drive.Science. 2017; 357: 1149-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that MnPOAdcyap1 neurons receive input from other structures that drive drinking, we performed cell-type-specific retrograde tracing by targeting the monosynaptic rabies virus to MnPOAdcyap1 neurons using an Adcyap1-2A-Cre mouse (Figure 3C). This revealed that MnPOAdcyap1 neurons receive strong, monosynaptic input from the SFO and OVLT (Figure 3C) as well as weaker input from several other structures (Figure S3A). Thus, these cells are activated by salt challenge and receive direct input from the SFO and OVLT, strongly suggesting that they are involved in the control of drinking behavior. To directly test the function of these cells, we targeted ChR2 to MnPOAdcyap1 neurons and positioned an optical fiber above the MnPO (Figure 3D). Photostimulation of MnPOAdcyap1 neurons caused rapid drinking behavior that was time-locked to the onset of stimulation (Figure 3E) and specific to water relative to hypertonic NaCl (Figure 3F) and food (Figure S3). Stimulation of MnPOAdcyap1 neurons also caused a rapid and reversible increase in blood pressure (Figure 3G; Figure S3). None of these responses were observed in control mice expressing GFP in MnPOAdcyap1 neurons (Figures 3E and 3G). We also observed no thermoregulatory response following stimulation of MnPOAdcyap1 neurons (Figure S3D), consistent with the dorsocaudal location of MnPOAdcyap1 neurons relative to the VMPOAdcyap1 neurons previously shown to regulate body temperature (Tan et al., 2016Tan C.L. Cooke E.K. Leib D.E. Lin Y.-C. Daly G.E. Zimmerman C.A. Knight Z.A. Warm-sensitive neurons that control body temperature.Cell. 2016; 167: 47-59.e15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In addition, stimulation of the largely overlapping MnPOVglut2 neuron population (Figure 3B) recapitulated the behavioral effects of MnPOAdcyap1 neuron stimulation (Figures S3H and S3I). Thus, activation of MnPOAdcyap1 neurons is sufficient to selectively drive the homeostatic responses to fluid imbalance. We next investigated the motivational mechanisms by which MnPOAdcyap1 neurons drive drinking behavior. We first tested mice in an FR3 task, which revealed that photostimulation of MnPOAdcyap1 neurons caused otherwise water-sated mice to vigorously and preferentially press the active lever to receive water (Figure 3H). This demonstrates that stimulation of MnPOAdcyap1 neurons drives instrumental responding for water and therefore that these cells promote drinking through a specific change in motivational state. To characterize the nature of this motivational signal, we measured the valence of MnPOAdcyap1 neuron activity using a real-time, place-preference test in which mice were selectively photostimulated when they occupied one chamber of a two-chamber testing apparatus (Figure 3I). At baseline, ChR2 mice showed no preference between the two chambers, but upon testing, they quickly developed a preference for the side without photostimulation (Figure 3I). In contrast, control mice developed no chamber preference despite repeated testing (Figure 3I). This indicates that activation of MnPOAdcyap1 neurons is aversive. To determine whether this aversive signal is sufficient to motivate instrumental responding, we tested whether mice would lever press to block photostimulation of MnPOAdcyap1 neurons (Figure 3J). We found that mice expressing ChR2 in MnPOAdcyap1 neurons exhibited dramatic lever pressing that was specifically directed toward the active lever (Figure 3J). We observed similar operant responding to shut off stimulation of MnPOVglut2 neurons (Figure S3J), whereas control mice showed little or no responding in any assay. Interestingly, mice engaged in significantly more vigorous and specific lever pressing to block stimulation of MnPOAdcyap1 neurons compared to otherwise identical experiments involving upstream OVLTAgtr1a and SFOGLUT neurons (850 ± 190 MnPOAdcyap1 versus 169 ± 51 SFOGLUT versus 134 ± 45 OVLTAgtr1a, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001). This suggests that these upstream signals may converge on the MnPO to generate an integrated motivational output. Little is known about how information about fluid balance exits the LT to engage downstream brain regions. SFOGLUT neurons promote thirst primarily through innervation of the other LT regions, the OVLT and MnPO, whereas they promote salt appetite through a projection to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) (Matsuda et al., 2017Matsuda T.

To investigate the downstream targets of thirst neurons in the MnPO, we performed anterograde tracing from MnPOAdcyap1 neurons using a Cre-dependent AAV expressing synaptophysin-GCaMP6s (Figure 4A). This revealed innervation of a distributed set of downstream structures, including reciprocal projections to the SFO and OVLT (Figure 4B; Figure S4A). Optogenetic stimulation of the retrograde MnPOAdcyap1→SFO pathway was sufficient to induce drinking and increase blood pressure (Figure S4), suggesting that these reciprocal connections may functionally synchronize LT activity. In addition to the SFO and OVLT, we found that MnPOAdcyap1 neurons project to a number of other structures, including the paraventricular hypothalamus (PVH), supraoptic nuclei (SON), lateral hypothalamus (LH), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), arcuate nucleus (ARC), and dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) (Figure 4C; Figure S4A). Anterograde tracing from MnPOVglut2 neurons revealed a similar set of projection targets (Figure S4B). As these structures have been linked to ingestive behavior, valence, and cardiovascular regulation, they represent candidates to mediate the behavioral and autonomic effects of LT stimulation. To probe the function of these pathways, we targeted ChR2 to MnPOAdcyap1 neurons and positioned an optical fiber above the PVH, LH, or PVT to enable photostimulation of MnPOAdcyap1 neuron terminals in these regions (Figures 4D, 4H, and 4L). Stimulation of all three sites induced voracious drinking that was time-locked to the onset of stimulation and absent from control mice (Figures 4E, 4I, and 4M). Photostimulation of terminals in the PVH and LH, but not the PVT, also induced a rapid increase in blood pressure (Figures 4F, 4J, and 4N; Figure S4D). This indicates that the effects of MnPOAdcyap1 neuron activation on drinking and blood pressure can be anatomically dissociated. We next investigated the motivational properties of these projections. Using a real-time, place-preference test, we found that photostimulation of terminals in the PVH and LH, but not the PVT, was aversive (Figures 4G, 4K, and 4O). Surprisingly, the aversive signal was not strong enough to motivate lever pressing to shut off photostimulation of any of these structures (Figure S4G). This may be, in part, because the valence of MnPOAdcyap1 neuron activity is diluted as it is partitioned across multiple anatomic pathways (Figure S4A). Taken together, these data reveal that the behavioral, motivational, and autonomic responses to fluid imbalance, which are unified within the LT, are differentially distributed as they exit the LT via projections of the MnPO. The nature of the motivational processes that drive eating and drinking has long been debated (Berridge, 2004Berridge K.C. Motivation concepts in behavioral neuroscience.Physiol. Behav. 2004; 81: 179-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar, Cabanac, 1971Cabanac M.

The drive-reduction hypothesis emphasized the fact that hunger and thirst are aversive states and therefore that animals may eat or drink to reduce this unpleasant sensation (Hull, 1943Hull C.L.

However, this idea was challenged by classic experiments showing that electrical stimulation of the LH, which promotes feeding, is rewarding rather than aversive (Berridge, 2004Berridge K.C.

However, it remains unclear if depressive symptoms throughout pregnancy are more harmful to the child than depressive symptoms only during certain times, and if maternal depressive symptoms after pregnancy add to or mediate any prenatal effects. 1,779 mother-child dyads participated in the Prediction and Prevention of Pre-eclampsia and Intrauterine Growth Restriction (PREDO) study. Mothers filled in the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale biweekly from 12+0–13+6 to 38+0–39+6 weeks+days of gestation or delivery, and the Beck Depression Inventory-II and the Conners’ Hyperactivity Index at the child’s age of 3 to 6 years (mean 3.8 years, standard deviation [SD] 0.5). Maternal depressive symptoms were highly stable throughout pregnancy, and children of mothers with consistently high depressive symptoms showed higher average levels (mean difference = 0.46 SD units, 95% Confidence Interval [CI] 0.36, 0.56, p < 0.001 compared to the low group), and proportion (32.1% vs. 14.7%) and odds (odds ratio = 2.80, 95% CI 2.20, 3.57, p < 0.001) of clinically significant ADHD symptoms. These associations were not explained by the effects of maternal depressive symptoms after pregnancy, which both added to and partially mediated the prenatal effects.

ST-induced TLR4 activation resulted in increased neuraminidase 3 (Neu3) production and activity in the duodenum. This led to intestinal alkaline phosphatase (IAP) desialylation and degradation. IAP deficiency caused a marked increase in commensal bacteria-generated lipopolysaccharide-phosphate in the colon, provoking inflammation.

Wnt/β-catenin signaling acts to regulate breast cancer; however, the molecular mechanisms determining its spatiotemporal regulation are largely unknown. In this study, we identified LGR4 as a master controller of Wnt/β-catenin signaling-mediated breast cancer tumorigenesis, metastasis, and cancer stem cell (CSC) maintenance. LGR4 expression in breast tumors correlated with poor prognosis. Either Lgr4 haploinsufficiency or mammary-specific deletion inhibited mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)- PyMT- and MMTV- Wnt1-driven mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis. Moreover, LGR4 down-regulation decreased in vitro migration and in vivo xenograft tumor growth and lung metastasis. Furthermore, Lgr4 deletion in MMTV- Wnt1 tumor cells or knockdown in human breast cancer cells decreased the number of functional CSCs by ∼90%. Canonical Wnt signaling was impaired in LGR4-deficient breast cancer cells, and LGR4 knockdown resulted in increased E-cadherin and decreased expression of N-cadherin and snail transcription factor -2 ( SNAI2) (also called SLUG), implicating LGR4 in regulation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

https://openalex.org/W3105443695,"Quantum effects, prevalent in the microscopic scale, generally elusive in macroscopic systems due to dissipation and decoherence. Quantum phenomena in large systems emerge only when particles are strongly correlated as in superconductors and superfluids. Cooperative interaction of correlated atoms with electromagnetic fields leads to superradiance, the enhanced quantum radiation phenomenon, exhibiting novel physics such as quantum Dicke phase and ultranarrow linewidth for optical clocks. Recent researches to imprint atomic correlation directly demonstrated controllable collective atom-field interactions. Here, we report cavity-mediated coherent single-atom superradiance. Single atoms with predefined correlation traverse a high-Q cavity one by one, emitting photons cooperatively with the atoms already gone through the cavity. Such collective behavior of time-separated atoms is mediated by the long-lived cavity field. As a result, a coherent field is generated in the steady state, whose intensity varies as the square of the number of traversing atoms during the cavity decay time, exhibiting more than ten-fold enhancement from noncollective cases. The correlation among single atoms is prepared with the aligned atomic phase achieved by nanometer-precision position control of atoms with a nanohole-array aperture. The present work deepens our understanding of the collective matter-light interaction and provides an advanced platform for phase-controlled atom-field interactions."

Here, we investigated the interactions between Leishmania donovani, the main etiological agent of visceral leishmaniasis, and the autophagic machinery of human macrophages. Our results revealed that during early infection—and via activation of the Akt pathway—Leishmania actively inhibits the induction of autophagy. However, by 24 h, Leishmania switched from being an inhibitor to an overall inducer of autophagy. These findings of a dynamic, biphasic response were based on the accumulation of lipidated light chain 3 (LC3), an autophagosome marker, by Western blotting and confocal fluorescence microscopy. We also present evidence that Leishmania induces delayed host cell autophagy via a mechanism independent of reduced activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR). Notably, Leishmania actively inhibited mTOR-regulated autophagy even at later stages of infection, whereas there was a clear induction of autophagy via some other mechanism. In this context, we examined host inositol monophosphatase (IMPase), reduced levels of which have been implicated in mTOR-independent autophagy, and we found that IMPase activity is significantly decreased in infected cells. These findings indicate that Leishmania uses an alternative pathway to mTOR to induce autophagy in host macrophages. Finally, RNAi-mediated down-regulation of host autophagy protein 5 (ATG5) or autophagy protein 9A (ATG9A) decreased parasite loads, demonstrating that autophagy is essential for Leishmania survival.

A better understanding of how the phenology responded to climatic determinants is important in order to better anticipate future climate-ecosystem interactions. We examined the changes of three phenological events for the Mongolian Plateau and their climatic determinants. To do so, we derived three phenological metrics from remotely sensed vegetation indices and associated these with climate data for the period of 1982 to 2011. The results suggested that the start of the growing season advanced by 0.10 days yr-1, the end was delayed by 0.11 days yr-1, and the length of the growing season expanded by 6.3 days during the period from 1982 to 2011. The delayed end and extended length of the growing season were observed consistently in grassland, forest, and shrubland, while the earlier start was only observed in grassland. Partial correlation analysis between the phenological events and the climate variables revealed that higher temperature was associated with an earlier start of the growing season, and both temperature and precipitation contributed to the later ending. Overall, our findings suggest that climate change will substantially alter the vegetation phenology in the grasslands of the Mongolian Plateau, and likely also in biomes with similar environmental conditions, such as other semi-arid steppe regions."

In β cells, elevated glucose concentrations lower AMPK activity, and the ablation of both catalytic subunits [β-cell-specific AMPK double-knockout (βAMPKdKO) mice] impairs insulin secretion in vivo and β-cell identity. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNAs that silence gene expression that are essential for pancreatic β-cell function and identity and altered in diabetes. Here, we have explored the miRNAs acting downstream of AMPK in mouse and human β cells. We identified 14 down-regulated and 9 up-regulated miRNAs in βAMPKdKO vs. control islets. Gene ontology analysis of targeted transcripts revealed enrichment in pathways important for β-cell function and identity. The most down-regulated miRNA was miR-184 (miR-184-3p), an important regulator of β-cell function and compensatory expansion that is controlled by glucose and reduced in diabetes. We demonstrate that AMPK is a potent regulator and an important mediator of the negative effects of glucose on miR-184 expression. Additionally, we reveal sexual dimorphism in miR-184 expression in mouse and human islets. Collectively, these data demonstrate that glucose-mediated changes in AMPK activity are central for the regulation of miR-184 and other miRNAs in islets and provide a link between energy status and gene expression in β cells.-Martinez-Sanchez, A., Nguyen-Tu, M.-S., Cebola, I., Yavari, A., Marchetti, P., Piemonti, L., de Koning, E., Shapiro, A.

https://openalex.org/W2775841389,"A fundamental role of the Hsp90 and Cdc37 chaperones in mediating conformational development and activation of diverse protein kinase clients is essential in signal transduction. There has been increasing evidence that the Hsp90-Cdc37 system executes its chaperoning duties by recognizing conformational instability of kinase clients and modulating their folding landscapes. The recent cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Hsp90-Cdc37-Cdk4 kinase complex has provided a framework for dissecting regulatory principles underlying differentiation and recruitment of protein kinase clients to the chaperone machinery. In this work, we have combined atomistic simulations with protein stability and network-based rigidity decomposition analyses to characterize dynamic factors underlying allosteric mechanism of the chaperone-kinase cycle and identify regulatory hotspots that control client recognition. Through comprehensive characterization of conformational dynamics and systematic identification of stabilization centers in the unbound and client- bound Hsp90 forms, we have simulated key stages of the allosteric mechanism, in which Hsp90 binding can induce instability and partial unfolding of Cdk4 client. Conformational landscapes of the Hsp90 and Cdk4 structures suggested that client binding can trigger coordinated dynamic changes and induce global rigidification of the Hsp90 inter-domain regions that is coupled with a concomitant increase in conformational flexibility of the kinase client. This process is allosteric in nature and can involve reciprocal dynamic exchanges that exert global effect on stability of the Hsp90 dimer, while promoting client instability. The network-based rigidity analysis and emulation of thermal unfolding of the Cdk4-cyclin D complex and Hsp90-Cdc37-Cdk4 complex revealed weak spots of kinase instability that are present in the native Cdk4 structure and are targeted by the chaperone during client recruitment. Our findings suggested that this mechanism may be exploited by the Hsp90-Cdc37 chaperone to recruit and protect intrinsically dynamic kinase clients from degradation. The results of this investigation are discussed and interpreted in the context of diverse experimental data, offering new insights into mechanisms of chaperone regulation and binding."

G4s play key roles as DNA regulatory sites and as kinetic traps that can inhibit biological processes, but how G4s are regulated in cells remains largely unknown. Here, we developed a kinetic framework for G4 disruption by DEAH-box helicase 36 (DHX36), the dominant G4 resolvase in human cells. Using tetramolecular DNA and RNA G4s with four to six G-quartets, we found that DHX36-mediated disruption is highly efficient, with rates that depend on G4 length under saturating conditions (kcat) but not under subsaturating conditions (kcat/Km). These results suggest that a step during G4 disruption limits the kcat value and that DHX36 binding limits kcat/Km. Similar results were obtained for unimolecular DNA G4s. DHX36 activity depended on a 3′ ssDNA extension and was blocked by a polyethylene glycol linker, indicating that DHX36 loads onto the extension and translocates 3′–5′ toward the G4. DHX36 unwound dsDNA poorly compared with G4s of comparable intrinsic lifetime. Interestingly, we observed that DHX36 has striking 3′-extension sequence preferences that differ for G4 disruption and dsDNA unwinding, most likely arising from differences in the rate-limiting step for the two activities. Our results indicate that DHX36 disrupts G4s with a conventional helicase mechanism that is tuned for great efficiency and specificity for G4s. The dependence of DHX36 on the 3′-extension sequence suggests that the extent of formation of genomic G4s may not track directly with G4 stability."

For this, we use spatially resolved radio-frequency spectroscopy to measure pairing energies spanning a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths. In the strongly interacting regime where the scattering length between fermions is on the same order as the inter-particle spacing, the pairing energy in the normal phase significantly exceeds the intrinsic two-body binding energy of the system and shows a clear dependence on local density. This implies that pairing in this regime is driven by many-body correlations, rather than two-body physics. We find this effect to persist at temperatures close to the Fermi temperature which demonstrates that pairing correlations in strongly interacting two-dimensional fermionic systems are remarkably robust against thermal fluctuations."

Thus, preventing PC loss is beneficial for attenuating vision impairment in patients with DR. Although many studies have revealed the mechanism of PC loss in retinas, little is known about the mechanisms that increase PC survival. We focused on the effect of β-adrenergic receptor agonists (β-agonists) on PC loss in diabetic retinas. In this study, β-agonists increased the cell viability of PCs by increasing PC survival and proliferation. Mechanistically, β-agonist-induced protein kinase B activation in PCs reduced PC apoptosis in response to various stimuli. β2-agonists more potently increased PC survival than β1-agonists. β2-Agonist reduced vascular leakage and PC loss in retinas of mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. In cocultures of PCs and ECs, β2-agonists restored the altered permeability and ZO-1 expression in ECs induced by PC loss.

Various methods are proposed to assess spinal flexibility, but which assessment method is more effective to predict the effect of orthotic treatment is unclear. Objective To investigate an effective assessment method of spinal flexibility to predict the initial in-orthosis correction, among the supine, prone, sitting with lateral bending and prone with lateral bending positions. Methods Thirty-five patients with AIS (mean Cobb angle: 28° ± 7°; mean age: 12 ± 2 years; Risser sign: 0–2) were recruited. Before orthosis fitting, spinal flexibility was assessed by an ultrasound system in 4 positions (apart from standing) including supine, prone, sitting with lateral bending and prone with lateral bending. After orthosis fitting, the initial in-orthosis correction was routinely assessed by whole spine standing radiograph. Comparisons and correlation analyses were performed between the spinal flexibility in the 4 positions and the initial in-orthosis correction. Results The mean in-orthosis correction was 41% while the mean curve correction (spinal flexibility) in the 4 studied positions were 40% (supine), 42% (prone), 127% (prone with lateral bending) and 143% (sitting with lateral bending). The correlation coefficients between initial in-orthosis correction and curve correction (spinal flexibility) in the 4 studied positions were r = 0.66 (supine), r = 0.75 (prone), r = 0.03 (prone with lateral bending) and r = 0.04 (sitting with lateral bending). Conclusions The spinal flexibility in the prone position is the closest to and most correlated with the initial in-orthosis correction among the 4 studied positions. Thus, the prone position could be an effective method to predict the initial effect of orthotic treatment on the patients with AIS."

In order to create interventions that are adapted to end-users, in-depth investigations about their opinions and preferences are required. As opinions and preferences may vary for different target groups, we explored these in two groups: the general population and a clinical sample. Methods Twenty adults from the general population (mean age = 42.65, 11 women) and twenty adults with type 2 diabetes (mean age = 64.30, 12 women) performed ‘MyPlan 1.0’, which is a self-regulation-based eHealth intervention designed to increase physical activity and the intake of fruit and vegetables in the general population. The opinions and preferences of end-users were explored using a think aloud procedure and a questionnaire. During a home visit, participants were invited to think aloud while performing ‘MyPlan 1.0’. The thoughts were transcribed verbatim and inductive thematic analysis was applied. Results Both groups had similar opinions regarding health behaviours and ‘MyPlan 1.0’. Participants generally liked the website, but often experienced it as time-consuming. Furthermore, they regularly mentioned that a mobile application would be useful to remind them about their goals on a daily basis. Finally, users’ ideas about how to pursue health behaviours often hindered them to correctly use the website. Conclusions Although originally created for the general population, ‘MyPlan 1.0’ can also be used in adults with type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, more adaptations are needed to make the eHealth intervention more convenient and less time-consuming. Furthermore, users’ ideas regarding a healthy lifestyle should be taken into account when designing online interventions."

Organic amendments improve soil quality by increasing the load of essential nutrients and enhancing the productivity. Additionally, fresh water used for irrigation can affect soil quality of agricultural soils, mainly due to the presence of microbial contaminants and pathogens. In this study, we investigated how microbial communities in irrigation water might contribute to the microbial diversity and function of soil. Whole-metagenomic sequencing approaches were used to investigate the taxonomic and the functional profiles of microbial communities present in fresh water used for irrigation, and in soil from a vegetable crop, which received fertilization with organic compost made from animal carcasses. The taxonomic analysis revealed that the most abundant genera were Polynucleobacter (~8% relative abundance) and Bacillus (~10%) in fresh water and soil from the vegetable crop, respectively. Low abundance (0.38%) of cyanobacterial groups were identified. Based on functional gene prediction, denitrification appears to be an important process in the soil community analysed here. Conversely, genes for nitrogen fixation were abundant in freshwater, indicating that the N-fixation plays a crucial role in this particular ecosystem. Moreover, pathogenicity islands, antibiotic resistance and potential virulence related genes were identified in both samples, but no toxigenic genes were detected. This study provides a better understanding of the community structure of an area under strong agricultural activity with regular irrigation and fertilization with an organic compost made from animal carcasses. Additionally, the use of a metagenomic approach to investigate fresh water quality proved to be a relevant method to evaluate its use in an agricultural ecosystem."

We designed multiple synthetic peptides mimicking the predicted cleavage sites of neurotoxin precursors. Using these peptides as substrates, we confirm the biochemical activity of the protease in propeptide removal from neurotoxin precursors by cleavage C-terminal of the PQM. Furthermore, the PQM protease also cleaves the iPQM relevant for heterodimerization of a subgroup of neurotoxins. An involvement in the maturing of cytolytic peptides is very likely, due to high similarity of present protease recognition motifs. Finally, bioinformatics analysis, identifying sequences of homolog proteins from 18 spiders of 9 families, demonstrate the wide distribution and importance of the isolated enzyme for spiders. In summary, we establish the first example of a PQM protease, essential for maturing of spider venom neurotoxins. In the future, the here described protease may be established as a powerful tool for production strategies of recombinant toxic peptides, adapted to the maturing of spider venom toxins."

Insulin-induced degradation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) represents a key negative feedback loop that restricts insulin signaling. Moreover, high concentrations of fatty acids (FAs) and glucose involved in the etiology of obesity-associated insulin resistance also contribute to the regulation of IRS1 degradation. The scavenger receptor CD36 binds many lipid ligands, and its contribution to insulin resistance has been extensively studied, but the exact regulation of insulin sensitivity by CD36 is highly controversial. Herein, we found that CD36 knockdown in C2C12 myotubes accelerated insulin-stimulated Akt activation, but the activated signaling was sustained for a much shorter period of time as compared with WT cells, leading to exacerbated insulin-induced insulin resistance. This was likely due to enhanced insulin-induced IRS1 degradation after CD36 knockdown. Overexpression of WT CD36, but not a ubiquitination-defective CD36 mutant, delayed IRS1 degradation. We also found that CD36 functioned through ubiquitination-dependent binding to IRS1 and inhibiting its interaction with cullin 7, a key component of the multisubunit cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Moreover, dissociation of the Src family kinase Fyn from CD36 by free FAs or Fyn knockdown/inhibition accelerated insulin-induced IRS1 degradation, likely due to disrupted IRS1 interaction with CD36 and thus enhanced binding to cullin 7. In summary, we identified a CD36-dependent FA-sensing pathway that plays an important role in negative feedback regulation of insulin activation and may open up strategies for preventing or managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Cell signaling is usually initiated by an activating ligand binding to a receptor on the plasma membrane that transmits the signal inside the cell. Distinct cellular responses and outcomes of a signaling pathway are achieved by precise regulation of its duration, magnitude, and subcellular compartmentalization, which is mediated by an integrated network with multiple positive and negative feedback and feedforward loops (1Lemmon M.A. Freed D.M.

Ubiquitination of IRS1 following phosphorylation on Ser-307 leads to its proteasome-dependent degradation, which, in conjunction with lysosomal degradation of IR, results in a decrease of insulin sensitivity after long-term stimulation by insulin (7Mayer C.M.

CD36 is highly expressed in myocytes, adipocytes, and hepatocytes where insulin signaling is a master metabolic regulator (14Hajri T. Abumrad N.A. Fatty acid transport across membranes: relevance to nutrition and metabolic pathology.Annu. Rev.

Accordingly, potential regulation of insulin signaling by CD36 has been extensively studied. Hepatic CD36 up-regulation is significantly associated with insulin resistance and increased steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (15Miquilena-Colina M.E. Lima-Cabello E.

Unadjusted CD36 mRNA and protein in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were higher among subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus versus control subjects (16Sun Y. Scavini M. Orlando R.A. Murata G.H.

However, some other studies suggested the opposite CD36 regulation of insulin sensitivity. CD36 deficiency in spontaneously hypertensive rats underlies insulin resistance and defective FA metabolism and hypertriglyceridemia (17Aitman T.J. Glazier A.M. Wallace C.A. Cooper L.D.

Similarly, muscle-specific overexpression of CD36 reverses insulin resistance in a mouse model caused by overexpressing a dominant-negative form of IGF-1 receptor specifically in muscle (MKR mice) (19Héron-Milhavet L.

Hepatic overexpression of CD36 improved glycogen homeostasis and attenuated high-fat diet–induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance (20Garbacz W.G. Lu P. Miller T.M. Poloyac S.M. Eyre N.S. Mayrhofer G. Xu M. Ren S. Xie W. Hepatic overexpression of CD36 improves glycogen homeostasis and attenuates high-fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2016; 36 (27528620): 2715-272710.1128/MCB.00138-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp study showed insulin resistance in people with genetic CD36 deficiency, which is common in Asian and African populations (21Miyaoka K. Kuwasako T. Hirano K. Nozaki S. Yamashita S. Matsuzawa Y. CD36 deficiency associated with insulin resistance.Lancet. 2001; 357 (11247555): 686-68710.1016/S0140-6736(00)04138-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), but a later study demonstrated that human CD36 deficiency is not necessarily responsible for insulin resistance (22Furuhashi M. Ura N. Nakata T. Shimamoto K. Insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism in human CD36 deficiency.Diabetes Care. 2003; 26 (12547883): 471-47410.2337/diacare.26.2.471Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Collectively, the exact regulation of insulin sensitivity by CD36 is highly controversial, and the underlying mechanisms are still unrevealed. CD36-null mice clear glucose faster than WT under chow diet. However, after switching to a diet high in fructose, CD36-null mice, but not WT mice, develop hyperinsulinemia, marked glucose intolerance, and decreased muscle glucose uptake (23Hajri T. Han X.X. Bonen A. Abumrad N.A. Defective fatty acid uptake modulates insulin responsiveness and metabolic responses to diet in CD36-null mice.J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109 (12021254): 1381-138910.1172/JCI0214596Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that insulin signaling is dynamically regulated by CD36, and this regulation may be highly dependent on different nutrient stress and hormone stimulation. Herein, we studied the magnitude and duration of insulin signaling as regulated by CD36 in C2C12 myotubes. Because IRS1 plays a critical role in the insulin signaling pathway and insulin-induced IRS1 degradation is a key negative feedback mechanism to maintain appropriate signal strength and duration, we further examined whether CD36 mediates dynamics of insulin signaling activation by regulating IRS1 stability. We demonstrated that CD36 interacts with IRS1 and reduces its interaction with CUL7, which prevents proteasomal degradation of IRS1 and leads to distinct regulation of insulin signaling before and after chronic insulin treatment. Previous studies suggested that CD36 regulation of insulin signaling may be highly dependent on nutrient and signaling states of the cells. We first investigated the role of CD36 in regulating the dynamic response of Akt activation to insulin stimulation. CD36 was efficiently knocked down in myotubes using an siRNA as we verified previously (24Zhou D. Samovski D. Okunade A.L. Stahl P.D. Abumrad N.A. Su X. CD36 level and trafficking are determinants of lipolysis in adipocytes.FASEB J. 2012; 26 (22815385): 4733-474210.1096/fj.12-206862Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Control or CD36 knockdown (KD) myotubes were treated with 10 nm insulin, and Akt phosphorylation was monitored for up to 240 min. Phosphorylation of Akt at Thr-308 and at Ser-473 were initially increased but then started to decline, partially due to negative feedback regulation to terminate signaling (Fig. 1, A, B, and C). As compared with control myotubes, insulin-stimulated p-Akt (Thr-308) and GSK3 phosphorylation were increased faster in CD36 KD myotubes but were maintained for a shorter period of time prior to deactivation (Fig. 1, A, B, and D). In contrast, activation and duration of Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 were similarly regulated by insulin in control and CD36 KD myotubes (Fig. 1, A and C), indicating specific accelerating activation of the p-Akt (Thr-308)/p-GSK3 pathway in response to loss of CD36 in myotubes. Insulin stimulated glycogen storage in both WT and CD36 KD myotubes. Similar to regulation of p-GSK3 by CD36, the increase of glycogen storage immediately after insulin stimulation was faster in CD36 KD myotubes, but this increase was sustained for a shorter period of time, and the glycogen accumulation reached a plateau after 4 h. In contrast, glycogen storage in WT myotubes kept increasing for a longer period of time (Fig. 1E). We then set out to compare differential regulation of insulin-induced Akt activation before and after insulin-induced insulin resistance. We examined acute Akt activation induced by insulin in control and CD36 KD myotubes following starvation. Insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK3 and Akt at Thr-308 was significantly higher in CD36 KD myotubes (Fig. 2A, B, and D). In contrast, phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 was not affected by CD36 knockdown (Fig. 2, A and C). We next examined whether CD36 is able to protect myotubes from insulin-induced insulin resistance. Myotubes were pretreated with 50 nm insulin for 4 h, washed, and then restimulated with different concentrations of insulin for 5 min (Fig. 2E). Phosphorylations of Akt at Ser-473 and Thr-308 and GSK3 were lower in CD36 KD myotubes than in control myotubes (Fig. 2, F–I), suggesting that CD36 protects myotubes from insulin-stimulated insulin resistance and that its regulation of insulin signaling is dependent on growth conditions. IRS1 not only plays an important role in relaying insulin stimulation to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway but also provides a site of negative feedback regulation to terminate signaling by undergoing insulin-stimulated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We examined whether IRS1 plays a role in the observed protective effect of CD36 on insulin-induced insulin resistance and found that the IRS1 level is higher in the presence of CD36 in myotubes following insulin treatment (Fig. 2, J and K), contributing to higher insulin sensitivity (Fig. 2F). Insulin-induced changes of IRS1 and IRS2 levels in control and CD36 KD myotubes were then followed. The level of IRS1 was gradually reduced after prolonged insulin incubation in control myotubes (Fig. 3A), and the rate of this degradation significantly accelerated after CD36 KD (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the IRS2 level was not decreased. We next examined rates of insulin-stimulated degradation of IRS1 and IRS2 in CHO cells overexpressing human insulin receptor (CHO/hIR) and stably expressing wildtype (CD36 WT) or the ubiquitination-deficient CD36 mutant where C-terminal lysines (Lys-469 and Lys-472) were substituted by alanine (CD36 K/A) as we established previously (25Smith J. Su X. El-Maghrabi R. Stahl P.D. Abumrad N.A. Opposite regulation of CD36 ubiquitination by fatty acids and insulin: effects on fatty acid uptake.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283 (18353783): 13578-1358510.1074/jbc.M800008200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We observed rapid degradation of IRS1 in CHO/hIR where CD36 is virtually absent. In contrast, the IRS2 level was not decreased by insulin treatment (Fig. 3B). Overexpression of CD36 WT significantly delayed insulin-stimulated IRS1 degradation, but this effect was not observed in cells overexpressing CD36 K/A (Fig. 3B). The expression levels of CD36 WT and CD36 K/A were similar, and the degradation of IR was not obvious (Fig. 3C). The insulin-stimulated degradation of IRS1 in CD36 KD myotubes as well as in CHO/hIR cells overexpressing CD36 was completely blocked by MG132 (Fig. S1), suggesting that CD36 regulates proteasomal degradation of IRS1. Phosphorylation at serine residues of IRS1 is a major regulator of insulin signaling. Phosphorylation at Ser-307 triggers IRS1 ubiquitination and degradation, whereas phosphorylation at Ser-612 blocks its interaction with PI3K (5Gual P. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Tanti J.F. Positive and negative regulation of insulin signaling through IRS-1 phosphorylation.Biochimie. 2005; 87 (15733744): 99-10910.1016/j.biochi.2004.10.019Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). S307A mutant IRS1 was more resistant to degradation following chronic exposure to insulin in rat hepatoma cells (26Greene M.W. Sakaue H. Wang L. Alessi D.R. Roth R.A.

CD36 interacts with Fyn tyrosine kinase, which binds IRS1 and forms a signaling complex (27Huang M.M. Bolen J.B. Barnwell J.W. Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S.

Control and CD36 KD myotubes were treated with insulin for 15 min, and serine phosphorylation of IRS1 was evaluated. The phosphorylation level of IRS1 at Ser-307 was increased in CD36 KD myotubes as compared with control myotubes (Fig. 4, C and D), which is consistent with the enhanced insulin-stimulated IRS1 degradation (Fig. 3). In contrast, the phosphorylation level of IRS1 at Ser-612 was reduced by CD36 knockdown (Fig. 4, C and E), which may contribute to the increased Akt activation following acute insulin stimulation (Fig. 2A). We used a GST pulldown approach to detect ubiquitinated IRS1 as described (30Lamb C.A. McCann R.K. Stöckli J. James D.E. Bryant N.J. Insulin-regulated trafficking of GLUT4 requires ubiquitination.Traffic. 2010; 11 (20854370): 1445-145410.1111/j.1600-0854.2010.01113.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Ubiquitinated IRS1 interacted with the GST-UBA fusion protein but not with a mutant version of the UBA domain predicted to abolish ubiquitin binding (GST-UBA mutant). In CD36 KD myotubes, the ubiquitinated IRS1 was higher than that in control myotubes (Fig. 4, F and G), which is presumably due to increased phosphorylation at Ser-307. We examined interaction of IRS1 with CD36 and how this interaction was affected by insulin in CHO/hIR cell lines. CD36 WT was coimmunoprecipitated with IRS1 using anti-IRS1 antibody (Fig. 5A). In contrast, the amount of ubiquitination-defective CD36 K/A mutant coimmunoprecipitated with IRS1 was much lower (Fig. 5A). CD36 WT was also able to pull down IRS1, but its K/A mutant was less effective (Fig. 5B). Our previous study showed that CD36 associates with the Src family kinase Fyn (31Samovski D. Sun J. Pietka T. Gross R.W. Eckel R.H. Su X. Stahl P.D. Abumrad N.A.

We examined the potential presence of IRS1-Fyn-CD36 complex and its regulation by CD36 ubiquitination and found that Fyn coimmunoprecipitated with IRS1 and CD36 (Fig. 5, A and B). Our results suggest that CD36 ubiquitination was important in its optimal interaction with IRS1 and in protecting IRS1 from insulin-stimulated degradation (Fig. 3B). The proteasomal degradation of IRS1 is regulated by CUL7 E3 ubiquitin ligase, and we next examined whether CD36 competes with CUL7 in interacting with IRS1. Overexpression of CD36 decreased coimmunoprecipitation of CUL7 by anti-IRS1 antibody (Fig. 5C). In contrast, the ubiquitination-defective CD36 K/A mutant with weaker interaction with IRS1 was less effective in blocking IRS1-CUL7 interaction (Fig. 5C). We then examined the presence of endogenous IRS1-Fyn-CD36 complex in myotubes. Both CD36 and Fyn coimmunoprecipitated with IRS1, and insulin treatment, which inhibits CD36 ubiquitination (25Smith J.

Because Fyn interacts with both IRS1 and CD36, we examined whether Fyn is required for CD36 interaction with IRS1. Fyn was coimmunoprecipitated with IRS1 in the absence of CD36. In contrast, Fyn KD significantly decreased CD36 coimmunoprecipitated with IRS1 (Fig. 5E). Disruption of endogenous CD36-IRS1 interaction either directly by CD36 KD or indirectly by Fyn KD enhanced the amounts of CUL7 coimmunoprecipitated with IRS1 (Fig. 5E). Inhibition of Fyn by Src inhibitor-1 (Src-1) decreased CD36 and increased CUL7 coimmunoprecipitated with IRS1 (Fig. 5F), suggesting a key role of Fyn and its kinase activity in CD36 regulation of IRS1 degradation. We set out to examine whether Fyn is involved in CD36 regulation of insulin-stimulated IRS1 degradation. Because the enhanced FFA interaction with CD36 promotes Fyn dissociation from the protein complex (31Samovski D. Sun J. Pietka T. Gross R.W. Eckel R.H. Su X. Stahl P.D. Abumrad N.A. Regulation of AMPK activation by CD36 links fatty acid uptake to β-oxidation.Diabetes. 2015; 64 (25157091): 353-35910.2337/db14-0582Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), we studied how FA may interfere with CD36 function in stabilizing IRS1. Myotubes were pretreated with BSA control, palmitic acid (PA), or oleic acid (OA) prior to stimulation with insulin, and the levels of IRS1 were determined. The degradation of IRS1 was significantly accelerated in PA- or OA-pretreated cells (Fig. 6A), and OA was more effective. In CD36 KD myotubes, the degradation of IRS1 could not be further accelerated by PA or OA pretreatment (Fig. 6A). Similarly, CD36 inhibition and Fyn dissociation by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate (SSO) pretreatment enhanced insulin-stimulated degradation of IRS1 (Fig. 6B). We next examined the effect of Fyn KD or pharmaceutical Src inhibition. The degradation of IRS1 in Fyn KD myotubes or myotubes pretreated with Src-1 was significantly accelerated. Fyn KD or Src-1 failed to further expedite the degradation of IRS1 in CD36 KD myotubes (Fig. 6, C and D). Similar regulation was observed in CHO/hIR cells overexpressing CD36 WT but not in control cells without CD36 or cells overexpressing CD36 K/A (Fig. S2). Therefore, association of Fyn with ubiquitinated CD36 and Fyn activity may be important in CD36 regulation of IRS1 degradation. The PI3K/Akt pathway conveys signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to regulate cell metabolism, proliferation, and survival. The spatial, temporal, or strength-controlling regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling determines its functional specificity. Sustained and periodic Akt signaling has an integral role in regulating T cell longevity, and antigen-activated CD4+ cells without Akt activity maintained over time are short-lived (32Song J. Salek-Ardakani S. Rogers P.R. Cheng M. Van Parijs L. Croft M. The costimulation-regulated duration of PKB activation controls T cell longevity.Nat.

Electroantennography (EAG) and a dynamic two-choice olfactometer were respectively used to measure the antennal and behavioral responses of both sexes to selected volatile compounds. Female and male D. helophoroides exhibited similar EAG and behavioral responses. Significant dose-dependent EAG responses in both sexes were elicited by nonanal, octanal, cis-3-hexenol, 3-carene, (R)-(+)-α-pinene, (S)-(-)-α-pinene, (R)-(+)-limonene and (S)-(-)-limonene. Female and male beetles were repelled at high concentration by cis-3-hexenol and (S)-(-)-limonene, respectively. Both sexes of D. helophoroides were significantly attracted to nonanal, cis-3-hexenol, 3-carene and (R)-(+)-limonene even at low concentrations. These compounds might be used either individually or in mixtures for developing biological control methods to attract this predatory beetle into forest stands threatened by cerambycid beetles."

We previously showed that AnxA5 can stabilize advanced atherosclerotic plaques by reducing macrophage infiltration. We now investigated the effects of AnxA5 administration on the onset of atherosclerosis development. Eight-week-old ApoE-/-mice were fed a western diet while being administered AnxA5 or control (M1234) for a total of 6 weeks. AnxA5 administration reduced plaque size in the aortic root as well as the aortic arch by 36% and 55% respectively. As determined by immunohistochemistry, administration of AnxA5 further stabilized plaque by reducing macrophage content and increasing smooth muscle cell content. Furthermore, the pre-treatment of HUVEC's with AnxA5 reduced monocyte adhesion under flow-conditions. Finally, AnxA5 administration results in a trend to reduced cell death more pronounced in the aortic arch than the aortic root. In conclusion, treatment with AnxA5 before the onset of atherosclerosis reduces plaque formation in a murine model of atherosclerosis in part by reducing apoptotic rates further to its beneficial effect on macrophage infiltration and activation."

Recent studies have reported that glioma stem-like cells transdifferentiate into endothelial cells, indicating a new mechanism for tumor angiogenesis and potentially providing new therapeutic options for glioblastoma treatment. Glioma malignancy is strongly associated with altered expression of N-linked oligosaccharide structures on the cell surface. We have previously reported that β1,4-galactosyltransferase V (β1,4GalTV), which galactosylates the GlcNAcβ1–6Man arm of the branched N-glycans, is highly expressed in glioma and promotes glioma cell growth in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism by which β1,4GalTV stimulates glioma growth is unknown. Here we demonstrate that short hairpin RNA–mediated β1,4GalTV knockdown inhibits the tumorigenesis of glioma stem-like cells and reduces their transdifferentiation into endothelial cells. We also found that β1,4GalTV overexpression increased glioma stem-like cell transdifferentiation into endothelial cells and that this effect required β1,4GalTV galactosylation activity. Moreover, β1,4GalTV promoted β1,4-galactosylation of Notch1 and increased Notch1 protein levels. Of note, ectopic expression of activated Notch1 rescued the inhibitory effect of β1,4GalTV depletion on glioma stem-like cell transdifferentiation. In summary, our findings indicate that β1,4GalTV stimulates transdifferentiation of glioma stem-like cells into endothelial cells by activating Notch1 signaling. These detailed insights shed important light on the mechanisms regulating glioma angiogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2778093784,"RNA interference (RNAi) based approaches can potentially be used to control insect pests. These approaches may depend on the usage of microRNA (miRNA) or double stranded RNA (dsRNA) mediated gene knockdown, which likely involves proteins that regulate these pathways, such as Argonaute 1 (Ago1), Argonaute 2 (Ago2), Dicer 1 (Dcr1), Dicer 2 (Dcr2), and Drosha in insects. We previously performed functional characterization of Ago2 and Dcr2 of western corn rootworm (WCR), Diabrotica virgifera virgifera (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) and observed that knockdown of Ago2 and Dcr2 ameliorated the lethal effect induced by the dsRNA-mediated knockdown of an essential gene in WCR, thereby confirming the involvement of Ago2 and Dcr2 in the dsRNA pathway. In the current study, we identified and characterized additional members of the Argonaute and Dicer gene families, namely Ago1, Ago3, Aubergine, and Dcr1, in a previously developed WCR transcriptome. We also identified a Drosha homolog in the same transcriptome. We evaluated the impacts on WCR adult fitness associated with the dsRNA-mediated knockdown of Ago1, Ago2, Dcr1, Dcr2, and Drosha genes. Among these putative RNAi pathway genes, only the knockdown of Ago1 incurred significant fitness costs such as reduced survival and oviposition rate, as well as decreased egg viability. The present study, to our knowledge, represents the first report showing that Ago1 is critical to the survival of insect adults. Our findings suggest that Ago1 plays an essential role in broader life stages of an insect than previously thought. Importantly, since fitness costs were not observed, downregulation or loss of function of RNAi pathway genes such as Ago2 or Dcr2 may confer resistance to pest control measures that rely on the normal functions of these genes. However, the precise roles of these genes under field conditions (i.e., in the presence of possible viral pathogens) requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2780384508,"The double-yolked (DY) egg is quite popular in some Asian countries because it is considered as a sign of good luck, however, the double yolk is one of the reasons why these eggs fail to hatch. The usage of automatic methods for identifying DY eggs can increase the efficiency in the poultry industry by decreasing egg loss during incubation or improving sale proceeds. In this study, two methods for DY duck egg identification were developed by using computer vision technology. Transmittance images of DY and single-yolked (SY) duck eggs were acquired by a CCD camera to identify them according to their shape features. The Fisher’s linear discriminant (FLD) model equipped with a set of normalized Fourier descriptors (NFDs) extracted from the acquired images and the convolutional neural network (CNN) model using primary preprocessed images were built to recognize duck egg yolk types. The classification accuracies of the FLD model for SY and DY eggs were 100% and 93.2% respectively, while the classification accuracies of the CNN model for SY and DY eggs were 98% and 98.8% respectively. The CNN-based algorithm took about 0.12 s to recognize one sample image, which was slightly faster than the FLD-based (about 0.20 s). Finally, this work compared two classification methods and provided the better method for DY egg identification."

Yet, the mechanisms that modulate Tomo-1 expression and its regulatory activity remain poorly defined. Here, we found that Tomo-1 expression levels influence postsynaptic spine density. Tomo-1 overexpression increased dendritic spine density, whereas Tomo-1 knockdown (KD) decreased spine density. These findings identified a novel action of Tomo-1 on dendritic spines, which is unique because it occurs independently of Tomo-1's C-terminal R-SNARE domain. We also demonstrated that the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is known to influence synaptic strength, dynamically regulates Tomo-1 protein levels. Immunoprecipitated and affinity-purified Tomo-1 from cultured rat hippocampal neurons was ubiquitinated, and the levels of ubiquitinated Tomo-1 dramatically increased upon pharmacological proteasome blockade. Moreover, Tomo-1 ubiquitination appeared to be mediated through an interaction with the E3 ubiquitin ligase HRD1, as immunoprecipitation of Tomo-1 from neurons co-precipitated HRD1, and this interaction increases upon proteasome inhibition. Further, in vitro reactions indicated direct, HRD1 concentration–dependent Tomo-1 ubiquitination. We also noted that the UPS regulates both Tomo-1 expression and functional output, as HRD1 KD in hippocampal neurons increased Tomo-1 protein level and dendritic spine density. Notably, the effect of HRD1 KD on spine density was mitigated by additional KD of Tomo-1, indicating a direct HRD1/Tomo-1 effector relationship.

Although PKA phosphorylation at serine-724 and SUMOylation at lysine-730 both reduce the inhibitory actions of Tomo-1, they do so by different means, as only PKA phosphorylation reduces Tomo-1 interaction with the R-SNARE syntaxin-1a. By comparison, CDK5 phosphorylation of Tomo-1 has been reported to increase its inhibitory properties on membrane trafficking (30Cazares V.A. Njus M.M. Manly A. Saldate J.J. Subramani A. Ben-Simon Y.

However, the role of the UPS in regulating Tomo-1 level within neurons remains unknown. Characterizing processes determining Tomo-1 protein level and functional state is important based on Tomo-1's key role in modulating vesicle release probability and trans-synaptic tuning in neurons. The purpose of the current study was to examine UPS-mediated regulation of Tomo-1 in hippocampal neurons and the impact of this regulation on synaptic structure.

Because Tomo-1 is reported to alter membrane trafficking and vesicle fusion, we initially examined whether Tomo-1 alters the density or morphology of dendritic spines in synaptically mature cultures of rat hippocampal neurons (17–24 days in vitro (DIV)). Neurons were transfected with a soluble mCherry fluorophore and co-transfected with one of the following expression constructs: 1) N-terminal–tagged eGFP m–Tomo-1 (Tomo-1), 2) eGFP m–Tomo-1 containing a C-terminal R-SNARE motif deletion (ΔCT), 3) cytosolic eGFP, as a control for the overexpression of vectors containing eGFP, 4) shRNA targeting m–Tomo-1 for knockdown (KD), and 5) the same shRNA vector with a scrambled nucleotide sequence replacing the Tomo-1 target sequence. In addition, we examined a condition in which shRNA KD of rat Tomo-1 was rescued with co-transfection of shRNA-resistant human N-terminal–tagged mCherry–Tomo-1. Effectiveness of the Tomo-1 KD and rescue was confirmed by both immunocytochemistry (ICC) (Fig. 1A, B and D) and Western blot analysis (Fig. 1, C and D). ICC was quantified in transfected, shRNA-expressing neurons, relative to neighboring nontransfected control neurons. High-resolution confocal imaging of neurons transfected with GFP Tomo-1 also demonstrated localization within the cytosol to dendrites and spines (Fig. 1E). For spine analysis co-expression of mCherry and either GFP Tomo-1 or shRNA constructs also encoding GFP was confirmed by imaging of both mCherry and GFP spectral lines. Western blotting of lysates from virally infected neuronal cultures demonstrated that our expression constructs successfully knock down, overexpress, and rescue Tomo-1 in neurons (Fig. 1, C and D). To restrict fluorescence analysis to processes arising from individual neurons, we transfected cultures under conditions generating low transfection efficiency (˜2–5 cells per coverslip). To assess alterations in dendritic spine density and morphology, transfected neurons were subjected to laser-scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) of mCherry fluorescence intensity over a series of Z-planes. Acquired Z-stacks were subsequently compiled to render 3D reconstructed dendrites from which spine density and morphology was quantified by following a single dendritic arbor projecting from each neuronal cell body. Representative images of dendrite segments for each condition tested are shown in Fig. 1F. Importantly, our results demonstrate that exogenous Tomo-1 expression specifically and significantly increased average spine density. In contrast, shRNA-mediated KD decreased dendritic spine density, an effect overcome by Tomo-1 rescue, relative to respective controls (Fig. 1G). This identifies a novel postsynaptic function for Tomo-1, as the sparse transfection makes an indirect presynaptic effect unlikely. Notably, this effect occurred independently of Tomo-1's C-terminal R-SNARE domain. That is, the effects on spine density of Tomo-1 lacking its R-SNARE domain (ΔCT) were not significantly different from those overexpressing wildtype Tomo-1. Expression of the scrambled shRNA control sequence (SCR) had no significant effect on spine density relative to GFP control. Although Tomo-1 overexpression and knockdown was found to affect spine density, no significant effects were found on total spine length (Fig. 1H), spine head maximum diameter (Fig. 1I), or spine head volume (Fig. 1J). However, the rescue of Tomo-1 expression did indicate increases in maximum spine head diameter and volume (Fig. 1, I and J, purple). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 1, K and L, cumulative frequency distributions of dendrite spine count versus distance from neuronal soma confirmed statistically significant differences between Tomo-1, ΔCT, and KD relative to respective controls. Notably, the cumulative distributions were generally linear for each condition, indicating a uniform distribution of spine number over the measured distance of the dendrite. These results are the first to indicate Tomo-1 protein has the capacity to regulate the genesis or stability of dendritic spines and, potentially, the integrative synaptic drive of hippocampal neurons in culture. Next we examined by ICC if endogenous Tomo-1 is co-localized with the postsynaptic density protein PSD95,"

In incomplete ossicular discontinuity (IOD), partial erosion of the ossicles occurs, but some sound transmission is noted throughout the ossicular chain. High-frequency conductive hearing loss (HfCHL) has been considered a hallmark of incomplete ossicular discontinuity. This study aims to evaluate the use of HfCHL as a preoperative predictor of IOD in patients with non-cholesteatomatous chronic suppurative otitis media. The HfCHL test was defined as the preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) at 4 kHz minus the average of the ABG at 0.25 and 0.5 kHz. The test was applied in 328 patients before surgery and compared to intraoperative findings as the gold standard. At surgery, 201 (61.3%) patients had an intact ossicular chain, 44 (13.4%) had a complete ossicular discontinuity, and 83 (25.3%) exhibited an IOD. The best cutoff level was calculated as 10 dB. The HfCHL test to diagnose IOD had a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 92% with a post-test probability of 78% and a likelihood ratio of 10.2. We concluded that the HfCHL test is highly effective in predicting IOD in patients with non-cholesteatomatous chronic suppurative otitis media and that it should be used routinely as a screening test prior to surgery."

Previous studies have indicated that stem-cell transplantation could be an effective treatment. However, little is known about the direct impact of transplanted cells on injured brain tissue. We wanted to help fill this knowledge gap and investigated effects of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) on the cerebral microcirculation after ischemia-reperfusion injury (I/RI). Treatment of HSPCs in I/RI for up to 2 wk after cerebral I/RI led to decreased mortality rate, decreased infarct volume, improved functional outcome, reduced microglial activation, and reduced cerebral leukocyte adhesion. Confocal microscopy and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analyses showed transplanted HSPCs emigrate preferentially into ischemic cortex brain parenchyma. We isolated migrated HSPCs from the brain; using RNA sequencing to investigate the transcriptome, we found metallothionein (MT, particularly MT-I) transcripts were dramatically up-regulated. Finally, to confirm the significance of MT, we exogenously administered MT-I after cerebral I/RI and found that it produced neuroprotection in a manner similar to HSPC treatment. These findings provide novel evidence that the mechanism through which HSPCs promote repair after stroke maybe via direct action of HSPC-derived MT-I and could therefore be exploited as a useful therapeutic strategy for stroke.—Smith, H.

Six clusters were differentiated by flow cytometry on the basis of their optical properties, two heterotrophic prokaryote (HP) subgroups labelled LNA and HNA (low and high nucleic acid content respectively), Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, autotrophic picoeukaryotes and nanoeukaryotes. HP represented an important component of the microbial assemblage over the survey with relatively small abundance variation through seasons. The carbon biomass ratio HP/ultraphytoplankton averaged 0.45, however this ratio exceeded 1 during spring. Ultraphytoplankton biomass made about 50% of the total autotrophic carbon estimates but this contribution increased up to 97% and 67% during the 2009 and 2010 spring periods respectively. Within ultraphytoplankton, nanoeukaryote represent the most important ultraphytoplankton group in terms of autotrophic carbon biomass (up to 70%). Picoeukaryote maximum abundance occurred in winter. Synechococcus was the most abundant population (maximum 1.2 x 10 5 cells cm-3) particularly in spring where it represented up to 54% of ultraphytoplankton carbon biomass. The warmer winter-spring temperatures and the lengthening of the stratification period created a favorable situation for the earlier appearance of Synechococcus and its persistence throughout summer, paralleling Prochlorococcus development. Prochlorococcus was dominant over summer and autumn with concentrations up to 1.0 × 10 5 cells cm-3. While the abundance of Synechococcus throughout survey was of the same order as that reported in western Mediterranean Sea, Prochlorococcus was more abundant and similar to the more typical oligotrophic and warm waters. The abundance variation of the ultraplankton components through the survey was relatable to variations in the hydrological and nutrient conditions."
