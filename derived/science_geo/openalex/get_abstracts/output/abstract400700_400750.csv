https://openalex.org/W2044293524,"Background Squamous cell lung carcinomas account for approximately 25% of new lung carcinoma cases and 40,000 deaths per year in the United States. Although there are multiple genomically targeted therapies for lung adenocarcinoma, none has yet been reported in squamous cell lung carcinoma. Methodology/Principal Findings Using SNP array analysis, we found that a region of chromosome segment 8p11-12 containing three genes–WHSC1L1, LETM2, and FGFR1–is amplified in 3% of lung adenocarcinomas and 21% of squamous cell lung carcinomas. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line harboring focal amplification of FGFR1 is dependent on FGFR1 activity for cell growth, as treatment of this cell line either with FGFR1-specific shRNAs or with FGFR small molecule enzymatic inhibitors leads to cell growth inhibition. Conclusions/Significance These studies show that FGFR1 amplification is common in squamous cell lung cancer, and that FGFR1 may represent a promising therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1999792045,"In the postnatal vasculature, fully differentiated and quiescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in a ""contractile"" phenotype are required for the normal regulation of vascular tone. The transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily of growth factors (TGF-βs and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs)) are potent inducers of contractile phenotype and mediate (i) induction of contractile genes, and (ii) inhibition of VSMC growth and migration. Transcription of contractile genes is positively regulated by a regulatory DNA element called a CArG box. The CArG box is activated by the binding of serum response factor and its coactivators, myocardin (Myocd) or Myocd-related transcription factors (MRTFs). Krüppel-like factor-4 (KLF4) is known to inhibit activation of the CArG box. However, the potential role of KLF4 in the contractile activities of TGF-β or BMP has not been explored. Here, we demonstrate that TGF-β and BMP4 rapidly down-regulate KLF4 through induction of microRNA-143 (miR-143) and miR-145, which leads to a reduction of KLF4 transcripts and decreased KLF4 protein expression. Inhibition of miR-145 prevents down-regulation of KLF4 and activation of contractile genes by TGF-β or BMP4, suggesting that modulation of KLF4 is a prerequisite for induction of contractile genes by TGF-β and BMP4. Interestingly, both TGF-β and BMP4 activate transcription of the miR-143/145 gene cluster through the CArG box, however, TGF-β mediates this effect through induction of Myocd expression, whereas BMP4 utilizes nuclear translocation of MRTF-A. Thus, this study sheds light on both the similarities and the differences of TGF-β and BMP4 signaling in the regulation of KLF4 and contractile genes."
https://openalex.org/W2093548226,"CRP (cAMP receptor protein), the global regulator of genes for carbon source utilization in the absence of glucose, is the best-studied prokaryotic transcription factor. A total of 195 target promoters on the Escherichia coli genome have been proposed to be under the control of cAMP-bound CRP. Using the newly developed Genomic SELEX screening system of transcription factor-binding sequences, however, we have identified a total of at least 254 CRP-binding sites. Based on their location on the E. coli genome, we predict a total of at least 183 novel regulation target operons, altogether with the 195 hitherto known targets, reaching to the minimum of 378 promoters as the regulation targets of cAMP-CRP. All the promoters selected from the newly identified targets and examined by using the lacZ reporter assay were found to be under the control of CRP, indicating that the Genomic SELEX screening allowed to identify the CRP targets with high accuracy. Based on the functions of novel target genes, we conclude that CRP plays a key regulatory role in the whole processes from the selective transport of carbon sources, the glycolysis-gluconeogenesis switching to the metabolisms downstream of glycolysis, including tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) pathway and aerobic respiration. One unique regulation mode is that a single and the same CRP molecule bound within intergenic regions often regulates both of divergently transcribed operons."
https://openalex.org/W2093737233,"Inflammatory processes play essential roles in the pathogenesis of tendinitis and tendinopathy. These events are accompanied by catabolic processes initiated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Pharmacological treatments for tendinitis are restricted to the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Recent studies in various cell models have demonstrated that curcumin targets the NF-κB signaling pathway. However, its potential for the treatment of tendinitis has not been explored. Herein, we used an in vitro model of human tenocytes to study the mechanism of curcumin action on IL-1β-mediated inflammatory signaling. Curcumin at concentrations of 5–20 μm inhibited IL-1β-induced inflammation and apoptosis in cultures of human tenocytes. The anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin included down-regulation of gene products that mediate matrix degradation (matrix metalloproteinase-1, -9, and -13), prostanoid production (cyclooxygenase-2), apoptosis (Bax and activated caspase-3), and stimulation of cell survival (Bcl-2), all known to be regulated by NF-κB. Furthermore, curcumin suppressed IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation via inhibition of phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitor of κBα, inhibition of inhibitor of κB-kinase activity, and inhibition of nuclear translocation of NF-κB. Furthermore, the effects of IL-1β were abrogated by wortmannin, suggesting a role for the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway in IL-1β signaling. Curcumin suppressed IL-1β-induced PI-3K p85/Akt activation and its association with IKK. These results demonstrate, for the first time, a potential role for curcumin in treating tendon inflammation through modulation of NF-κB signaling, which involves PI-3K/Akt and the tendon-specific transcription factor scleraxis in tenocytes.

The global incidence of tendon injuries has increased in conjunction with the rise in aging and inflammatory diseases (1Maffulli N. Wong J. Almekinders L.C. Clin. Sports Med. 2003; 22: 675-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The etiology of tendinopathy is considered to be multifactorial, but mechanical loading, overuse injury (or association with arthritis), adverse effects of quinolone antibiotics or other drugs, degeneration, and inflammation that cause tendon injuries and rupture are the major causative factors (2Almekinders L.C. J. Am. Acad. Orthop. Surg. 1998; 6: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 3Riley G. Rheumatology. 2004; 43: 131-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 4Sendzik J. Shakibaei M.

Toxicology. 2005; 212: 24-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Tenocytes are embedded in an extensive three-dimensional network of extracellular matrix components consisting predominantly of collagen type I fibrils (>95% of the total collagen in tendon), other types of collagen (type III and type V), proteoglycans, elastin, and fibronectin (6Bernard-Beaubois K. Hecquet C. Houcine O. Hayem G. Adolphe M. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1997; 13: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 7Kannus P. Scand. J. Med. Sci.

J. 2000; 350: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These specific matrix components give tendon its resilience and biomechanical stability. Tendon and ligament are dense fibrous connective tissues with a very limited intrinsic potential for regeneration (7Kannus P. Scand. J. Med. Sci. Sports. 2000; 10: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 9Butler D.L. Juncosa N. Dressler M.R. Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2004; 6: 303-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Therefore, their repair and regeneration poses a complex clinical challenge. It is important to understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in tendon degeneration during the early stages of disease pathogenesis to develop new and effective treatments for tendinopathy. Subtle changes such as the release of IL-1β or other inflammatory cytokines by infiltrating macrophages/monocytes may occur (10Tsuzaki M. Guyton G. Garrett W. Archambault J.M. Herzog W. Almekinders L. Bynum D. Yang X. Banes A.J. J. Orthop. Res. 2003; 21: 256-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Moreover, like in other connective tissue injuries, tendon inflammation is accompanied by the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β. In vitro studies have shown that IL-1β can induce inflammatory mediators such as COX-2, prostaglandin E2, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), 3The abbreviations used are: MMPmatrix metalloproteinaseIKKIκBα kinaseSCXAscleraxisTRAF1TNF receptor-associated factor 1. all known to be involved in tendon matrix degradation (11Archambault J.

IL-1β is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that has been reported to be present in significantly increased quantities in the synovium where it enhances inflammatory reactions in injured joints (13Gotoh M. Hamada K. Yamakawa H. Nakamura M. Yamazaki H. Ueyama Y. Tamaoki N. Inoue A. Fukuda H. J. Rheumatol. 2000; 27: 2886-2892PubMed Google Scholar, 14Gotoh M. Hamada K. Yamakawa H. Yanagisawa K. Nakamura M. Yamazaki H. Inoue A. Fukuda H. J. Orthop. Res. 2002; 20: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling pathways activated by IL-1β are responsible for stimulating MMP expression and COX-2 production. However, these pathways have not been explored in detail in tendon cells. Pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-1β) induce activation of a central transcription factor known as NF-κB, which is a key regulator of gene expression (15Barnes P.J. Karin M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1997; 336: 1066-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (4271) Google Scholar, 16Largo R. Alvarez-Soria M.A. Díez-Ortego I. Calvo E. Sánchez-Pernaute O. Egido J. Herrero-Beaumont G. Osteoarthritis Cartilage. 2003; 11: 290-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). NF-κB is present in the cytoplasm in its resting stage as a heterotrimer complex consisting of two subunits and an additional inhibitory subunit, IκBα (17Kumar A. Takada Y. Boriek A.M. Aggarwal B.B. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 434-448Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During the activation process, the inhibitory subunit IκBα is phosphorylated at Ser-32 and Ser-36 residues by IKK kinase (IκBα kinase) and is subsequently degraded. Once released, subunits of activated NF-κB translocate to the nucleus and mediate transcription of various inflammatory and catabolic gene products (16Largo R. Alvarez-Soria M.A. Díez-Ortego I.

NF-κB activation has been shown to regulate the expression of more than 500 different gene products linked with inflammation, tumor cell transformation, survival, proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis, and chemoresistance (19Sung B. Pandey M.K. Ahn K.S. Yi T. Chaturvedi M.M. Liu M. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2008; 111: 4880-4891Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibitors of NF-κB activation may have therapeutic potential and are actively being researched. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly prescribed for the treatment of tendinitis (20Wang J.H. Iosifidis M.I. Fu F.H. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 2006; 443: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs is associated with numerous side effects, which can be quite adverse. Therefore, the search is still on for safer and more selective pharmacotherapies for tendinopathy. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a naturally occurring polyphenol derived from the rhizome of Curcuma longa Linn, with the potential for treatment of various diseases acting via NF-κB inhibition (21Bharti A.C. Aggarwal B.B. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 22Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B.

Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7597-7609Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Commercially available preparations of curcumin contain three major components: curcumin (77%), demethoxycurcumin (17%), and bisdemethoxycurcumin (3%), altogether referred to as the “curcuminoids” (22Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar, 24Aggarwal B.B. Kumar A. Bharti A.C.

Recent studies have shown that curcumin mediates its effects by modulation of several important molecular targets, including transcription factors (e.g. NF-κB, AP-1, β-catenin, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ), enzymes (e.g. COX-2, 5-LOX, and iNOS), pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6), and cell surface adhesion molecules. Because of its ability to modulate the expression of these targets, the therapeutic potential of curcumin for treating cancer, arthritis, diabetes, Crohn disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoporosis, Alzheimer disease, psoriasis, and other pathologies is now under investigation (24Aggarwal B.B. Kumar A. Bharti A.C. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 363-398PubMed Google Scholar, 28Shakibaei M. John T. Schulze-Tanzil G. Lehmann I. Mobasheri A. Biochem.

Furthermore, curcumin has been studied in clinical trials for its anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic, and free radical scavenger properties (22Bharti A.C. Donato N. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. Blood. 2003; 101: 1053-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Phase I clinical trials have indicated that human subjects can tolerate curcumin doses as high as 8–12 g/day with no adverse side effects (30Cheng A.L. Hsu C.H. Lin J.K. Hsu M.M. Ho Y.F. Shen T.S. Ko J.Y. Lin J.T. Lin B.R. Ming-Shiang W. Yu H.S. Jee S.H. Chen G.S. Chen T.M. Chen C.A. Lai M.K. Pu Y.S. Pan M.H. Wang Y.J. Tsai C.C. Hsieh C.Y.

Cancer Res. 2001; 7: 1894-1900PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, several aspects of the pharmacological properties and the use of curcumin for cancer chemoprevention have been reviewed recently (32Shehzad A. Wahid F. Lee Y.S. Arch. Pharm. 2010; 343: 489-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Although curcumin is a potent inhibitor of NF-κB, its effects on human tenocytes have not been investigated at the cellular or molecular levels. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI-3Ks) are a highly conserved family of kinases that catalyze the 3-position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositides to generate phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (33Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). PI-3K is a heterodimeric lipid kinase consisting of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit that plays a pivotal role in cell movement, growth, vesicular trafficking, mitogenesis, and cell survival (34Coffer P.J. Geijsen N. M'rabet L. Schweizer R.C. Maikoe T. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 35Heldin C.H. Ostman A. Rönnstrand L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1378: F79-113PubMed Google Scholar). PI-3K is involved in the IL-1β signaling pathway and mediates activation and translocation of NF-κB through targeting IKK-α or phosphorylation of p65, a process that is inhibited by the PI-3K-specific inhibitor wortmannin (36Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 37Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Several reports suggest that PI-3K activates protein kinase B (Akt), one of the main downstream kinases in cells (33Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 38Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar). However, the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway has not yet been implicated in the activation of NF-κB in tenocytes. The aim of this study was to exploit an in vitro model of human tenocytes to study the mechanism of curcumin in IL-1β signaling and investigate whether curcumin might antagonize the catabolic effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines by suppressing NF-κB-activation and NF-κB-induced gene expression. We also explored the molecular mechanisms by which curcumin suppresses NF-κB activation in tenocytes, a process that was partly mediated by the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway. The following antibodies were purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA): polyclonal anti-collagen type I, polyclonal anti-collagen type III, polyclonal anti-decorin antibody, and alkaline phosphatase linked sheep anti-mouse and sheep anti-rabbit secondary antibodies for immunoblotting. Polyclonal anti-active caspase-3 was obtained from R&D Systems. Monoclonal antibody to β-actin, and protein A/G-Sepharose beads were from Sigma. Polyclonal anti-tenomodulin (sc-49325) and anti-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3K) p85 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal anti-scleraxis (SCXA) (ab58655) was obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Polyclonal anti-active caspase-3 (AF835) was purchased from R&D Systems. Antibodies against phospho-specific IκBα (Ser-32/36) and against anti-phospho-specific p65 (NF-κB)/(Ser-536) were obtained from Cell Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-IκB kinase (anti-IKK)-α and (anti-IKK)-β antibodies were obtained from Imgenex (Hamburg, Germany). All antibodies were used at concentrations and dilutions recommended by the manufacturer (dilutions ranged from 1:100 for immunomorphological experiments to 1:10,000 for Western blot analysis). Secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were purchased from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Growth medium (Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (50/50) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 25 μg/ml of ascorbic acid, 50 IU/ml of streptomycin, 50 IU/ml of penicillin, 2.5 μg/ml of amphotericin B, essential amino acids, and l-glutamine) was obtained from Seromed (Munich, Germany). Trypsin/EDTA (EC 3.4.21.4) and wortmannin were purchased from Sigma. Epon was obtained from Plano (Marburg, Germany). Curcumin with a purity of greater than 95% was purchased from Indsaff (Punjab, India). Curcumin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide as a stock concentration of 500 μm and stored at −80 °C. Serial dilutions were prepared in culture medium. Curcumin was diluted in dimethyl sulfoxide as a 5000 μm concentration and then further diluted in cell culture medium. IL-1β was obtained from Acris Antibodies GmbH (Herold, Germany). The peritendineum of human tendon explants (healthy finger tendon of one male middle-aged donor), obtained during tendon-rupture surgery, was carefully removed before culturing in growth medium (Ham's F-12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (50/50)) for several days (39Schulze-Tanzil G. Mobasheri A. Clegg P.D. Sendzik J. John T. Shakibaei M. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 122: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Tendon samples were derived from patients with full informed consent and local ethics committee approval. After 1–2 weeks, tenocytes continuously migrated from this explant and adhered to Petri dishes. Tendon cells were trypsinized and expanded in monolayers to gain a sufficient number of cells for the experiments described. Tenocyte monolayer cultures were washed three times with serum-starved medium and incubated for 1 h with serum-starved medium (3% FCS). Serum-starved human tenocytes were either left untreated or treated with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β alone for the indicated time periods or pre-treated with 5 μm curcumin or 5 μm curcumin for 4 h followed by co-treatment with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β and 5 μm curcumin for the indicated time periods. For investigation of NF-κB translocation and IκBα phosphorylation, primary tenocyte monolayer cultures were washed three times with serum-starved medium and incubated for 1 h with serum-starved medium (3% FCS). The cells were then either treated with 5 μm curcumin or 20 nm wortmannin or pre-treated with 5 μm curcumin or 20 nm wortmannin for 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 min, followed by stimulation with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β for 30 min. In separate experiments, tenocytes were preincubated with curcumin or wortmannin at the indicated concentrations for 4 h followed by co-treatment with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β and curcumin or wortmannin for 30 min. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were then prepared as described later. These experiments were performed in triplicate and the results are provided as mean values from three independent experiments. The effect of curcumin on the nuclear translocation of p65 was investigated by an immunocytochemical method as previously described in detail (28Shakibaei M. John T. Schulze-Tanzil G. Lehmann I. Mobasheri A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 1434-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Briefly, human tenocytes were cultured on glass coverslips and incubated for 24 h. Serum-starved human tenocytes were treated with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β or 5 μm curcumin, or were pre-treated with 5 μm curcumin for 4 h and then co-treated with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β and curcumin for 30 min in serum-starved medium. Glass coverslips with tenocyte monolayers were rinsed three times in Hanks' solution before methanol fixation for 10 min at ambient temperature, and rinsing with PBS. Cell and nuclear membranes of tenocytes were permeabilized by treatment with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 1 min on ice. Cells were overlaid with protease-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 10 min at ambient temperature, rinsed with PBS, and incubated with primary antibodies (phospho-p65) in a humid chamber overnight at 4 °C. They were gently washed several times with PBS before incubation with rhodamine red-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 h at ambient temperature and finally washed again three times with Aqua dest. Counterstaining was performed with DAPI to visualize the cell nuclei. Samples were evaluated by light microscopy (Leica, Germany) and photomicrographs were digitally captured and stored. For Western blot analysis proteins were extracted from the monolayer cultures with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 0.01% (v/v) aprotinin, 4 μg/ml of pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, PMSF) on ice for 30 min as previously described (40Shakibaei M.

Total protein concentration was measured with the bicinchonic acid assay system (Uptima, Monlucon, France) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Samples were further reduced with 2-mercaptoethanol and equal quantities of protein (500 ng/lane), separated under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE using 5, 7.5, 10, and 12% gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes using a transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). After preincubation in blocking buffer (5% skimmed milk powder in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20) for 1 h, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight, washed three times with blocking buffer, and then further incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at ambient temperature. After further washing in 0.1 m Tris, pH 9.5, containing 0.05 m MgCl2 and 0.1 m NaCl, specific antigen-antibody complexes were detected using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoylphosphate (p-toluidine salt; Pierce). Electron microscopy was performed as previously described (41Shakibaei M. De Souza P. Merker H.J. Cell Biol. Int. 1997; 21: 115-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayer cultures were fixed for 1 h in Karnovsky fixative followed by post-fixation in 1% OsO4 solution. After dehydration in an ascending alcohol series, pellets were embedded in Epon and cut ultrathin with a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E (Darmstadt, Germany). Sections were contrasted with a mixture of 2% uranyl acetate/lead citrate and examined with a transmission electron microscope (TEM 10, Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Isolation of tenocyte cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts was performed as previously described (29Csaki C. Mobasheri A. Shakibaei M. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2009; 11: R165Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Briefly, tenocytes were trypsinized and washed twice in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS. The supernatant was carefully removed. The cell pellet was resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors and was incubated on ice for 15 min. Then 12.5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40 was added and the cell suspension was vigorously mixed for 15 s. The extracts were centrifuged for 1.5 min. The supernatants (cytoplasmic extracts) were frozen at −70 °C. 25 μl of ice-cold nuclear extraction buffer were added to the pellets and incubated for 30 min with intermittent mixing. Extracts were centrifuged, and the supernatant (nuclear extracts) was transferred to pre-chilled tubes for storage at −70 °C. To test the effect of curcumin on IL-1β-induced IKK activation, immune complex kinase assays were performed as previously described (29Csaki C. Mobasheri A. Shakibaei M. Arthritis Res. Ther. 2009; 11: R165Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The IKK complex was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates with antibodies against IKK-α and IKK-β and subsequently incubated with protein A/G-agarose beads (Pierce). After 2 h of incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and resuspended in a kinase assay solution containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm unlabeled ATP, and 2 mg of substrate GST-IκBα (amino acids 1 to 54), and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. Phosphorylation of GST-IκBα was assessed using a specific antibody against phospho-specific IκBα (Ser-32/36). To demonstrate the total amounts of IKK-α and IKK-β in each sample, whole cell lysates were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane after SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions as described above. Detection of IKK-α and IKK-β was performed by immunoblotting with either anti-IKK-α or anti-IKK-β antibodies. To examine the effect of curcumin on IL-1β-induced acetylation of p65, tenocytes were pre-treated with 5 μm curcumin for 4 h and then exposed to 10 ng/ml of IL-1β for the indicated times. The cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 0.01% (v/v) aprotinin, 4 μg/ml of pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml of leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to prepare whole cell lysates. Whole cell extracts were pre-cleared by incubating with 25 μl of either normal rabbit IgG serum or normal mouse IgG serum and protein A/G-Sepharose beads, then with primary antibodies (anti-p65 antibody) appropriately diluted in wash buffer (0.1% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm PMSF) for 2 h at 4 °C. After 1 h of incubation, immunocomplexes were washed with lysis buffer, boiled with SDS sample buffer for 5 min, resolved on SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-acetyl-lysine antibody. Tenocytes were grown in growth medium for 24 h. PI-3K inhibition experiments were carried out in serum-starved medium. Tenocytes were pre-treated for 1 h with serum-starved medium containing wortmannin (1, 10, and 20 nm) for 1 h, treated with 5 μm curcumin for 4 h, and then exposed to 10 ng/ml of IL-1β for 1 h. After these treatments, nuclear extracts were prepared and examined for NF-κB as described above. The optical density (specific binding) of each protein band was measured and semiquantitatively analyzed using the Quantity One software package (Bio-Rad). The results are shown as the mean ± S.D. of a representative experiment performed in triplicate. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of curcumin on the PI-3K/Akt signaling pathway leading to activation of the transcription factor NF-κB signaling pathway and on NF-κB-regulated gene products in human tenocytes in an in vitro model of tendinopathy. Tenocytes treated with curcumin (5–20 μm) or wortmannin (1–40 nm) showed no signs of cytotoxic effects or any negative effects on cell viability (data not shown) at the light microscopic and ultrastructural levels. To examine the effect of curcumin on the NF-κB activation pathway, we used IL-1β because the pathway activated by this cytokine is relatively well understood. Untreated monolayer tenocytes exhibited typically flattened shapes with small cytoplasmic processes, large mostly euchromatic nuclei with nucleoli and a well structured cytoplasm (Fig. 1A, a). Treatment of tenocyte monolayer cultures with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β for 12, 24, and 48 h led to degenerative changes such as multiple vacuoles, swelling of rough endoplasmic reticulum, and clustering of swollen mitochondria, condensed heterochromatin in the cell nuclei, and multiple autophagic cytoplasmic vacuoles. The flattened monolayer tenocytes became more and more rounded, lost their microvilli-like processes, and became apoptotic (Fig. 1A, b–d). Tenocytes that were pretreated with curcumin (4 h) and then co-treated with IL-1β and 5 μm curcumin for 12, 24, and 48 h showed less severe cellular degeneration at the ultrastructural level as early as 12 h after co-treatment (Fig. 1A, e–g). The tenocytes regained a flattened shape and numerous microvilli-like cytoplasmic processes. Statistical evaluation of the data clearly highlighted changes in the number of cells with mitochondrial changes before and after IL-1β-treatment. Co-treatment with curcumin clearly decreased the number of cells with mitochondrial changes (Fig. 1B). Serum-starved human tenocytes were cultured for 24 h and then treated with 10 ng/ml of IL-1β or 5 μm curcumin or were pre"
https://openalex.org/W2066336750,"Lipid microdomains or caveolae, small invaginations of plasma membrane, have emerged as important elements for lipid uptake and glucose homeostasis. Sphingomyelin (SM) is one of the major phospholipids of the lipid microdomains. In this study, we investigated the physiological function of sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2) using SMS2 knock-out mice, and we found that SMS2 deficiency prevents high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Interestingly, in the liver of SMS2 knock-out mice, large and mature lipid droplets were scarcely observed. Treatment with siRNA for SMS2 also decreased the large lipid droplets in HepG2 cells. Additionally, the siRNA of SMS2 decreased the accumulation of triglyceride in liver of leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mice, strongly suggesting that SMS2 is involved in lipid droplet formation. Furthermore, we found that SMS2 exists in lipid microdomains and partially associates with the fatty acid transporter CD36/FAT and with caveolin 1, a scaffolding protein of caveolae. Because CD36/FAT and caveolin 1 exist in lipid microdomains and are coordinately involved in lipid droplet formation, SMS2 is implicated in the modulation of the SM in lipid microdomains, resulting in the regulation of CD36/FAT and caveolae. Here, we established new cell lines, in which we can completely distinguish SMS2 activity from SMS1 activity, and we demonstrated that SMS2 could convert ceramide produced in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane into SM. Our findings demonstrate the novel and dynamic regulation of lipid microdomains via conformational changes in lipids on the plasma membrane by SMS2, which is responsible for obesity and type 2 diabetes.

Our findings demonstrate the novel and dynamic regulation of lipid microdomains via conformational changes in lipids on the plasma membrane by SMS2, which is responsible for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Obesity and insulin resistance are commonly associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, leading to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Elucidation of the mechanisms underlying fat accumulation in liver is a very important matter. Studies have revealed that the biological membrane contains regions known as lipid microdomains that are enriched in sphingolipids, glycosphingolipid, or cholesterol. There are many types of microdomains, differing in lipid composition or detergent solubility, and each microdomain might have a distinct function, such as acting as a “raft” or “glycosynapse” (1Hakomori S.I. Glycoconj. J. 2000; 17: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 2Hakomori S.I. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 1901-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 3Simons K. Gerl M.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 688-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). Caveolae are small invaginations on the plasma membrane and are sites with many glycosphingolipid, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol-rich lipid microdomains. Mice deficient in caveolin 1, a scaffolding protein of caveolae, are lean and resistant to diet-induced obesity, suggesting that caveolae and lipid microdomains may be important for the uptake of triglycerides (TG) 2The abbreviations used are: TGtriglycerideSMsphingomyelinFAfatty acidDIOdiet-induced obesityHFDhigh fat dietNDnormal dietGTTglucose tolerance testWATwhite adipose tissueoxLDLoxidized LDLPPARperoxisome proliferator activated receptorDIMdetergent-insoluble membrane microdomainSNALPstable nucleic acid lipid particleFATfatty acid transporterSMasesphingomyelinaseMβCDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinMEFmouse embryonic fibroblastpAbpolyclonal antibodyPCphosphatidylcholineCerceramide. and fatty acids (4Razani B.

Along with cholesterol, sphingomyelin (SM) is a major component in lipid microdomains. Its synthetic enzyme is sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), for which the gene was identified in 2004 (6Yamaoka S.

Holthuis J.C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). This enzyme has three isoforms, SMS1, SMS2, and SMSr. SMS1 is responsible for the bulk of SM production in the Golgi apparatus, and SMSr controls ceramide homeostasis in the endoplasmic reticulum, regulating the synthesis of ceramide phosphoethanolamine (8Tafesse F.G.

In a recent report, SMS2 deficiency attenuated NFκB activation and decreased atherosclerosis (10Hailemariam T.K. Huan C. Liu J. Li Z. Roman C. Kalbfeisch M. Bui H.H. Peake D.A. Kuo M.S. Cao G.

However, the study did not fully address the mechanism of SMS2 involvement in atherosclerosis and NFκB activation or whether SMS2 has a function distinct from SMS1. The SMS2 deficiency might also affect the metabolism of ceramide, sphingosine, and sphingosine 1-phosphate. Because these bioactive lipids act in signal transduction (13Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2440) Google Scholar, 14Kim R.H. Takabe K. Milstien S. Spiegel S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1791: 692-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), their effects could be complex requiring additional studies to elucidate mechanisms. In this study, we reveal that SMS2 is responsible for diet-induced obesity and lipid droplet formations in liver. We further provide details implicating SMS2 as a novel regulator of lipid microdomain structure and function. A vector for targeting deletion of the SMS2-exon 2, containing a cassette encoding β-galactosidase and a neomycin-selectable marker (Nls-lacZ and PGK-neo), was electroporated into mouse D3 embryonic stem cells. Homologous recombinations were selected using G418 and Southern blotting. Recombinant cells were karyotyped to ensure that 2N chromosomes were present in most metaphase spreads. Chimeric mice derived from correctly targeted ES cells were mated with C57BL/6 mice to obtain F1 Sgms2+/− mice. The recombination event was also confirmed by LA-PCR using tail samples of the mice obtained from Sgms2+/− × Sgms2+/− mating (Fig. 1B). PCR primers used to the LA-PCR were as follows: a, 5′-CCAAGTGACCTTCAAGTTTTGCTGTCTC-3′; b, 5′-CCAAGTGACCTTCAAGTTTTGCTGTCTC-3′; c, 5′-CAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGACGTTG-3′; d, 5′-TACATGATGTGTGATGACTACATGCCAG-3′; e, 5′-TCGCCTTCTATCGCCTTCTTGAC-3′; and f, 5′-GCATGCGTTCAGCGCGTTTGTATCCAC-3′. The primer positions are illustrated in Fig. 1A. All experiments were performed using N8 generation, which was obtained by eight rounds of backcrossing to C57BL/6 (B6.129-sgms2tmlKenw). The generation of SMS1 knock-out mice has described previously (15Yano M. Watanabe K. Yamamoto T. Ikeda K. Senokuchi T. Lu M. Kadomatsu T. Tsukano H. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Yamaoka S. Okazaki T.

Leptin-deficient ob/ob mice were obtained from Japan SLC Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan). To establish diet-induced obesity, the mice were fed a high fat diet (60% kcal from fat; 58Y1, TestDiet, Richmond, IN) from weeks 4 to 15 of age. Control mice were fed a standard chow diet (AIN76A, TestDiet) during the same period. Body weight was measured once a week. The amount of food intake was monitored during weeks 7–9. The amounts of triglycerides, free fatty acids, and cholesterol in plasma and liver tissues were determined using a Triglyceride E-test Wako kit (Wako, Japan), a NEFA C-test Wako kit (Wako), and a Cholesterol E-test Wako kit (Wako), respectively. The isolated liver from each mouse was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and 8-μm-thick frozen sections were prepared as described previously (16Mitsutake S. Yokose U. Kato M. Matsuoka I. Yoo J.M. Kim T.J. Yoo H.S. Fujimoto K. Ando Y. Sugiura M. Kohama T. Igarashi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 363: 519-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The sections were stained with standard hematoxylin and eosin, and lipid droplets were stained with Oil-Red-O as described elsewhere (17Dentin R. Benhamed F. Hainault I. Fauveau V. Foufelle F. Dyck J.R. Girard J. Postic C. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 2159-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Following a 16-h fast, mice were injected intraperitoneally with a glucose solution (2 g/kg body weight). Glucose levels in blood collected from the tail vein before and after glucose injection (at 15, 30, 60, and 120 min) were measured using an ACCU-CHEK Aviva glucometer (Roche Applied Science). Plasma insulin levels in 8-week-old male mice were determined by a mouse insulin ELISA kit (Shibayagi, Gunma, Japan). Using a combination of TRIzol® and PureLinkTM RNA mini kits (Invitrogen), total RNA was extracted from the liver and adipose tissue of WT and SMS2 KO mice, according to kit instructions. First strand cDNA was synthesized using a PrimeScript RT master mix (TAKARA Bio, Otsu, Japan), and then real time PCR was performed using selected primers (supplemental Table 1) by SYBR Premix EX Taq (TAKARA Bio) and a Thermal Cycler Dice Real Time System (TAKARA Bio) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transcript levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in liver or adipose tissue, respectively. SM and Cer amounts in isolated tissue or cells were determined using electron ionization-LC/MS (LC, Agilent1100, Agilent Technologies; MS, LCQ fleet, ThermoFisher Scientific), as described previously (18Ohno Y. Suto S. Yamanaka M. Mizutani Y. Mitsutake S. Igarashi Y. Sassa T. Kihara A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 18439-18444Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 19Houjou T. Yamatani K.

The amount of PC was determined using a phosphatidylcholine assay kit (BioVision). We used Cer (C16:0, d18:1) and SM (C16:0, d18:1) as standards to quantify Cer and SM, respectively. Standards were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipid (Alabaster, AL). SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed according to the standard methods of Laemmli (21Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar) and Towbin et al. (22Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44893) Google Scholar), respectively. For protein detection on Western blot, we employed an anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (Sigma), anti-V5 polyclonal antibody (pAb) (Sigma), anti-FLAG mAb (Sigma), anti-FLAG pAb (Sigma), anti-calnexin pAb (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), anti-caveolin 1 mAb (BD Biosciences), or anti-CD36 mAb (eBioscience, San Diego) as a primary antibody, and an anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (GE Healthcare), anti-rabbit IgG-HRP antibody (GE Healthcare), or anti-rat IgG-HRP antibody (GE Healthcare) as a secondary antibody. Bands were detected using a combination of an ECL Plus kit (GE Healthcare) and luminescent image analysis by an LAS4000 (Fuji Film, Tokyo). For CD36 detection in liver tissue, de-N-glycosidase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) was added to samples prior to performing SDS-PAGE. COS7 cells were co-transfected with plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and then the cells were incubated overnight. To isolate detergent-insoluble lipid microdomains, the cells were lysed, homogenized, and subjected to a sucrose density gradient according to the method described previously (23Pohl J. Ring A. Korkmaz U. Ehehalt R. Stremmel W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 24-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In brief, the cells were incubated on ice with chilled lysis buffer containing 20 mm CHAPS (Sigma), CompleteTM protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), and PhoStopTM phosphatase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) in TNE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA). The resulting lysate was adjusted to 42% sucrose and overlaid with a discontinuous sucrose gradient (6 ml of 30% sucrose or 2 ml of 0% sucrose) in TNE buffer. The tube was centrifuged at 34,100 rpm for 18 h in an SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments), and the solution was fractionated from the top to the bottom. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 1% Brij 99 (Sigma) and CompleteTM and PhoStopTM inhibitor mixtures (Roche Applied Science) in TNE buffer, and then the lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads were then washed four times with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. HepG2 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transiently transfected with siRNA (h-siSMS2-1, 5′-GGGCAUUGCCUUCAUAUAU-3′; h-siSMS2-2, 5′-GCACACGAACACUACACUA-3′; control siRNA, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) using LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 2 days, the formation of lipid droplets was induced by adding oleic acid/BSA mixture; final oleic acid concentration was 400 μm in culture media. After a 1-day incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the lipid droplets were stained with Nile Red. The size and number of the lipid droplets were quantified using a fluorescent microscope (BZ-9000, Keyence, Osaka, Japan). In vivo siRNA experiments were performed as described previously using an siRNA delivery system of stable nucleic acid lipid particles (SNALP) (24Semple S.C. Akinc A. Chen J. Sandhu A.P. Mui B.L.

In brief, a SNALP/siRNA mixture containing SMS2 siRNA (m-siSMS2-1, 5′-GGCUCUUUCUGCGUUACAA-3′; m-siSMS2-2, 5′-GGAUGGUAUUGGUUGGGUU-3′; or control siRNA, 5′-UUCUCCGAACGUGUCACGU-3′) was administered intravenously into the tail vein of leptin-deficient ob/ob mice in a total volume of 10 ml/kg. After 10 days, the triglycerol amount in the liver of each mouse was determined. The generation and analysis of SMS1 knock-out mice have been described previously (15Yano M. Watanabe K. Yamamoto T. Ikeda K. Senokuchi T. Lu M. Kadomatsu T. Tsukano H. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Yamaoka S. Okazaki T. Umehara H. Gotoh T. Song W.J. Node K. Taguchi R. Yamagata K. Oike Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 3992-4002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). We generated double knock-out mice lacking both SMS1 and SMS2 and isolated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) from the mouse embryo. The MEF were immortalized by SV40 T antigen as described previously (25Mitsutake S. Suzuki C. Akiyama M. Tsuji K. Yanagi T. Shimizu H. Igarashi Y. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2010; 60: 128-129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). From the immortalized MEF, we cloned the cell line ZS2. V5-tagged SMS1 and SMS2 were stably expressed in ZS2 cells by retrovirus gene transfer systems (Clontech) using the pQCXIP-SMS1-V5 and pQCXIH-SMS2 vector, respectively, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The obtained cells, which stably expressed SMS1 or SMS2, were named ZS2/SMS1 and ZS2/SMS2, respectively. We also immortalized MEF from SMS2 knock-out mice (SMS2 KO-MEF) and control littermate WT mice (WT-MEF). Additionally, reconstituted cells (SMS2 KO/SMS2 MEF) were produced using a retrovirus gene transfer systems with the pQCXIH-SMS2 vector as above. Cells were maintained in a humidified chamber with a 5% CO2 atmosphere and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS. When we determined SM levels, the cells were cultured with the serum-free medium OptiPro SFM (Invitrogen) to block the SM supply from serum. The in vitro SM synthase activity of cells was determined by BODIPY-C5-Cer, as described previously (26Hanada K. Kumagai K. Yasuda S. Miura Y. Kawano M. Fukasawa M. Nishijima M. Nature. 2003; 426: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Experiments using the CERT inhibitor HPA-12 were performed as described by Yasuda et al. (27Yasuda S. Kitagawa H. Ueno M.

For the recovery experiment of SM, cells were labeled with [14C]choline for 5 h and preincubated for 30 min with 80 μm dynasore (a dynamin II inhibitor; Sigma) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. The medium was changed to DMEM containing 100 microunits/ ml bacterial SMase (Staphylococcus aureus, Sigma) and 80 μm dynasore, and the cells were incubated for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with DMEM, and incubated for 60 min in DMEM containing 80 μm dynasore. In each step, lipids were extracted and separated on a Silica Gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate (Merck) as described previously (6Yamaoka S. Miyaji M. Kitano T. Umehara H. Okazaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18688-18693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Bands corresponding to [14C]SM were quantified by imaging analyzer FLA7000 (Fuji film). Uptake assays utilizing [14C]oleic acid (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis) were performed as described previously (28Pohl J. Ring A. Ehehalt R. Schulze-Bergkamen H. Schad A. Verkade P. Stremmel W. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4179-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A pcDNA6.2-GFP-SMS2, pHcRed-CD36/FAT, or pHcRed-caveolin 1 plasmid was co-transfected to COS7 cells using LipofectamineTM2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After an overnight incubation at 37 °C, fluorescent images were directly obtained by a confocal laser scanning microscope, FluoView®FV10i (Olympus, Tokyo). For immunofluorescent microscopy, ZS2/SMS1 or ZS2/SMS2 cells were fixed and then permeabilized for 10 min in phosphate-buffered saline with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton X-100. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 4 h with both an anti-V5 mAb (Invitrogen) and an anti-GM130 pAb (BD Biosciences) and then for 2 h with Alexa 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) or Alexa 594-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen). Coverslips were mounted with Prolong Gold®antifade with DAPI (Invitrogen), and confocal images were obtained using the FluoView®FV10i microscope. All plasmids used in this study were made using the Gateway® recombination system (Invitrogen). The cDNA of SMS1, SMS2, CD36/FAT, or caveolin 1 was amplified from mouse liver cDNA (Clontech) by PCR with selected primers as follows: SMS1, 5′-CACCATGTTGTCTGCCAGGACCATG-3′ and 5′-TGTGTCGTTTACCAGCCGG-3′ (the stop codon was disrupted for C-terminal protein fusion); SMS2, 5′-CACCATGGATATCATAGAGACAGCAAAA-3′ and 5′-GGTAGACTTCTCATTATCCTCCC-3′ (the stop codon was disrupted for C-terminal protein fusion); CD36/FAT, 5′-CACCATGGGCTGTGATCGGAACTGTG-3′ and either 5′-TTATTTTCCATTCTTGGATTTGCAAGCAC-3′ or 5′-TTTTCCATTCTTGGATTTGCAAGCAC-3′ (the stop codon was disrupted for C-terminal protein fusion); and CAV1, 5′-CACCATGTCTGGGGGCAAATACGTAG-3′ and 5′-TCATATCTCTTTCTGCGTGCTGAT-3′. The cDNA was then cloned to a pENTRTMD-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). As a destination vector, we employed a pcDNA6.2/V5-DEST or pcDNA6.2/C-EmGFP-DEST vector (Invitrogen). The pQCXIP (Clontech), pQCXIH (Clontech), pHcRed (Clontech), and p3×FLAG-myc-CMV26 (Sigma) vectors were converted to destination vectors using the Gateway® vector conversion system (Invitrogen), producing pQCXIP-DEST, pQCXIH-DEST, pHcRed-DEST, and p3×FLAG-DEST, respectively. Gateway®LR reactions were performed as described in the Gateway® instruction manual (Invitrogen), to finally produce the pcDNA6.2-SMS1-V5, pcDNA6.2-SMS2-V5, pcDNA6.2-CAV1, pcDNA6.2-SMS2-EmGFP, pHcRed-CD36/FAT, pHcRed-caveolin 1, p3×FLAG-CD36/FAT, p3×FLAG-caveolin 1, pQCXIP-SMS1-V5, and pQCXIH-SMS2-V5 plasmids. All materials and reagents were of highest purity available. The mouse SMS2 gene (Sgms2) in ES cells was targeted by homologous recombination (Fig. 1A). The SMS2 gene was successfully disrupted (Fig. 1B), and this disruption was associated with a loss of SMS2 expression (Fig. 1C). The obtained SMS2 knock-out (SMS2 KO) mice were seemingly healthy and displayed almost no apparent abnormalities. Initially, we determined the amounts of SM, Cer, and PC in the livers of the SMS2 KO mice and control wild type (WT) mice (Fig. 1D). The SMS2 deficiency reduced SM levels by about 20%, with no apparent effect on Cer or PC levels. Our data indicate that most SM is synthesized by SMS1, and so the effect of SMS2 deficiency on SM levels is mild and restricted. This lack of effect on SM levels might account for the absence of abnormalities in SMS2 KO mice. These results prompted a question as to whether SMS2 might be simply redundant to SMS1. To identify a particular function of SMS2, we performed a diet-induced obesity (DIO) test. In the DIO test, mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD) or normal diet (ND) from 4 to 15 weeks of age. In the wild type (WT) mice, HFD potently increased the body weight (Fig. 2A). However, interestingly, there were no significant differences between the HFD-fed and ND-fed groups of SMS2 KO mice. The SMS2 deficiency completely prevented the HFD-induced increase in body weight. The average amounts of food intake during the DIO test were not significantly different between the SMS2 KO and WT mice (Fig. 2B). We also examined the effect of SMS2 deficiency on HFD-induced glucose intolerance or insulin resistance. As expected, the fasting blood glucose was higher in the HFD-fed group of WT mice (Fig. 2C), indicating impaired insulin sensitivity in the liver. However, the HFD-fed group of SMS2 KO mice did not show any increase in fasting blood glucose, compared with the ND-fed group. A GTT reflected impaired blood glucose clearance in the HFD-fed group of WT mice. In contrast, the HFD-fed group of SMS2 KO mice exhibited levels of glucose clearance comparable with those of the ND-fed group of WT and SMS2 KO mice (Fig. 2, D and E). SMS1 deficiency is known to severely impair islet and insulin secretion (15Yano M. Watanabe K. Yamamoto T. Ikeda K. Senokuchi T. Lu M. Kadomatsu T. Tsukano H. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Yamaoka S. Okazaki T. Umehara H. Gotoh T. Song W.J. Node K. Taguchi R. Yamagata K. Oike Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 3992-4002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), yet SMS2 KO mice were able to secrete insulin in response to feeding (Fig. 2F), indicating that SMS2 deficiency does not impair insulin secretion. These results show that SMS2 deficiency prevents HFD-induced insulin resistance, indicating that SMS2 is likely to be involved in the development of diabetes. Upon surgical examination of the HFD-fed mice during the DIO test period, an impressive difference was found in the livers of WT and SMS2 KO mice. As expected, the livers of the HFD-fed WT mice grossly appeared whitish-red, indicating a fatty liver (Fig. 3A). Oil-Red-O staining of liver sections clearly demonstrated that the liver of HFD-fed WT mice accumulated huge amounts of neutral lipids (red-stained spots) and large vacuous vesicles, which were the remains of large lipid droplets (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the livers of the HFD-fed SMS2 KO mice accumulated little or no Oil-Red-O-positive neutral lipids or large lipid droplets. The amounts of TG, a major Oil-Red-O-positive neutral lipid, were determined in these livers (Fig. 3C). TG levels in the HFD-fed WT mice were five times higher than those in the corresponding ND-fed group. Interestingly, no statistically significant difference was observed between the HFD-fed group and ND-fed group in SMS2 KO mice. These results clearly demonstrate that SMS2 deficiency prevents HFD-induced accumulation of TG in the liver and the resulting development of large lipid droplets and fatty liver. Additionally, the amounts of epididymal WAT were determined in each group of mice. The SMS2 deficiency clearly suppressed the growth of epididymal WAT, observed in HFD-fed WT mice (Fig. 3D). We also examined the levels of free fatty acid, TG, and cholesterol in plasma. There were no significant differences in plasma TG or cholesterol levels between WT and SMS2 KO mice in either the ND- or HFD-fed groups (Fig. 3, F and G). However, SMS2 KO mice exhibited higher levels of free fatty acid than WT mice did in both the HFD- and ND-fed groups (Fig. 3E). To gain insight into the mechanisms of how SMS2 deficiency prevents HFD-induced obesity and fatty liver, we examined the expression levels of genes implicated in obesity and fatty liver using real time quantitative PCR in liver and adipose tissue. Interestingly, although HFD induced the expression of the fatty acid transporter CD36/FAT ∼5 times in WT mice, SMS2 deficiency strongly suppressed this HFD-induced increase of CD36/FAT (Fig. 4A). Similar to the mRNA expression, HFD increased the protein of CD36/FAT in WT mice, yet there was almost no difference between HFD-fed and ND-fed SMS2 KO mice (Fig. 4, C and D). The nuclear receptor PPARγ, a regulator of gene expression of many lipid metabolic enzymes in response to lipid ligands such as fatty acid or its oxidized derivatives, was elevated in HFD-fed WT mice. Interestingly, the HFD-induced increase of PPARγ was also strongly suppressed in SMS2 KO mice (Fig. 4A). Because the expression level of CD36/FAT is elevated by PPARγ, and CD36/FAT facilitates cellular uptake of fatty acid (PPARγ ligand), their expressions are synergistically increased, leading to lipid droplet formation (29Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). In our WT mice, the synergistic elevations occurred in response to HFD. In contrast, the SMS2 deficiency suppressed the HFD-induced increase of CD36/FAT and PPARγ, suggesting that SMS2 could regulate CD36/FAT-mediated uptake of fatty acid. Indeed, the plasma of SMS2 KO mice possessed higher levels of free fatty acid than that of WT mice (Fig. 3E), also indicating impaired fatty acid uptake in SMS2 KO mice. Conversely, there were almost no differences between WT and SMS2 KO mice in either the H"
https://openalex.org/W2119264365,"Background Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) species group (alpha-9) of the Alphapapillomavirus genus contains HPV16, HPV31, HPV33, HPV35, HPV52, HPV58 and HPV67. These HPVs account for 75% of invasive cervical cancers worldwide. Viral variants of these HPVs differ in evolutionary history and pathogenicity. Moreover, a comprehensive nomenclature system for HPV variants is lacking, limiting comparisons between studies. Methods DNA from cervical samples previously characterized for HPV type were obtained from multiple geographic regions to screen for novel variants. The complete 8 kb genomes of 120 variants representing the major and minor lineages of the HPV16-related alpha-9 HPV types were sequenced to capture maximum viral heterogeneity. Viral evolution was characterized by constructing phylogenic trees based on complete genomes using multiple algorithms. Maximal and viral region specific divergence was calculated by global and pairwise alignments. Variant lineages were classified and named using an alphanumeric system; the prototype genome was assigned to the A lineage for all types. Results The range of genome-genome sequence heterogeneity varied from 0.6% for HPV35 to 2.2% for HPV52 and included 1.4% for HPV31, 1.1% for HPV33, 1.7% for HPV58 and 1.1% for HPV67. Nucleotide differences of approximately 1.0% - 10.0% and 0.5%–1.0% of the complete genomes were used to define variant lineages and sublineages, respectively. Each gene/region differs in sequence diversity, from most variable to least variable: noncoding region 1 (NCR1) /noncoding region 2 (NCR2) >upstream regulatory region (URR)> E6/E7 > E2/L2 > E1/L1. Conclusions These data define maximum viral genomic heterogeneity of HPV16-related alpha-9 HPV variants. The proposed nomenclature system facilitates the comparison of variants across epidemiological studies. Sequence diversity and phylogenies of this clinically important group of HPVs provides the basis for further studies of discrete viral evolution, epidemiology, pathogenesis and preventative/therapeutic interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2158903457,"Mass mortality events are increasing dramatically in all coastal marine environments. Determining the underlying causes of mass mortality events has proven difficult in the past because of the lack of prior quantitative data on populations and environmental variables. Four-year surveys of two shallow-water sponge species, Ircinia fasciculata and Sarcotragus spinosulum, were carried out in the western Mediterranean Sea. These surveys provided evidence of two severe sponge die-offs (total mortality ranging from 80 to 95% of specimens) occurring in the summers of 2008 and 2009. These events primarily affected I. fasciculata, which hosts both phototrophic and heterotrophic microsymbionts, while they did not affect S. spinosulum, which harbors only heterotrophic bacteria. We observed a significant positive correlation between the percentage of injured I. fasciculata specimens and exposure time to elevated temperature conditions in all populations, suggesting a key role of temperature in triggering mortality events. A comparative ultrastructural study of injured and healthy I. fasciculata specimens showed that cyanobacteria disappeared from injured specimens, which suggests that cyanobacterial decay could be involved in I. fasciculata mortality. A laboratory experiment confirmed that the cyanobacteria harbored by I. fasciculata displayed a significant reduction in photosynthetic efficiency in the highest temperature treatment. The sponge disease reported here led to a severe decrease in the abundance of the surveyed populations. It represents one of the most dramatic mass mortality events to date in the Mediterranean Sea."
https://openalex.org/W2166788616,"Transient environmental influences, such as perinatal nutritional stress, may induce deleterious metabolic symptoms that last for the entire life of individuals, implying that epigenetic modifications play an important role in this process. We have investigated, in mice, the consequences of maternal undernutrition during gestation and lactation on DNA methylation and expression of the leptin gene, which plays a major regulatory role in coordinating nutritional state with many aspects of mammalian biology. We show that animals born to mothers fed a low-protein-diet (F1-LPD group) have a lower body weight/adiposity and exhibit a higher food intake than animals born to mothers fed a control diet (F1-CD group). These modifications persisted throughout life and were associated with lower levels of leptin mRNA and protein in starved F1-LPD mice, emphasizing that maternal protein-undernutrition affects the balance between food intake and energy expenditure in adults. Moreover, this nutritional stress resulted in the removal of methyls at CpGs located in the promoter of leptin, causing a permanent specific modification in the dynamics of the expression of leptin, which exhibits a stronger induction in the F1-LPD than in F1-CD mice in response to a meal. This study is an example of a molecular rationale linking transient environmental influences to permanent phenotypic consequences.—Jousse, C., Parry, L., Lambert-Langlais, S., Maurin, A.

https://openalex.org/W2019787596,"Background Antidepressant drugs (ADs) have been shown to activate BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) receptor TrkB in the rodent brain but the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unclear. ADs act as monoamine reuptake inhibitors and after prolonged treatments regulate brain bdnf mRNA levels indicating that monoamine-BDNF signaling regulate AD-induced TrkB activation in vivo. However, recent findings demonstrate that Trk receptors can be transactivated independently of their neurotrophin ligands. Methodology In this study we examined the role of BDNF, TrkB kinase activity and monoamine reuptake in the AD-induced TrkB activation in vivo and in vitro by employing several transgenic mouse models, cultured neurons and TrkB-expressing cell lines. Principal Findings Using a chemical-genetic TrkBF616A mutant and TrkB overexpressing mice, we demonstrate that ADs specifically activate both the maturely and immaturely glycosylated forms of TrkB receptors in the brain in a TrkB kinase dependent manner. However, the tricyclic AD imipramine readily induced the phosphorylation of TrkB receptors in conditional bdnf−/− knock-out mice (132.4±8.5% of control; P = 0.01), indicating that BDNF is not required for the TrkB activation. Moreover, using serotonin transporter (SERT) deficient mice and chemical lesions of monoaminergic neurons we show that neither a functional SERT nor monoamines are required for the TrkB phosphorylation response induced by the serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine or citalopram, or norepinephrine selective reuptake inhibitor reboxetine. However, neither ADs nor monoamine transmitters activated TrkB in cultured neurons or cell lines expressing TrkB receptors, arguing that ADs do not directly bind to TrkB. Conclusions The present findings suggest that ADs transactivate brain TrkB receptors independently of BDNF and monoamine reuptake blockade and emphasize the need of an intact tissue context for the ability of ADs to induce TrkB activity in brain."
https://openalex.org/W2121670270,"Intraperitoneal transplantation of human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) cells has been shown to reduce sensorimotor deficits after hypoxic ischemic brain injury in neonatal rats. However, the neuronal correlate of the functional recovery and how such a treatment enforces plastic remodelling at the level of neural processing remains elusive. Here we show by in-vivo recordings that hUCB cells have the capability of ameliorating the injury-related impairment of neural processing in primary somatosensory cortex. Intact cortical processing depends on a delicate balance of inhibitory and excitatory transmission, which is disturbed after injury. We found that the dimensions of cortical maps and receptive fields, which are significantly altered after injury, were largely restored. Additionally, the lesion induced hyperexcitability was no longer observed in hUCB treated animals as indicated by a paired-pulse behaviour resembling that observed in control animals. The beneficial effects on cortical processing were reflected in an almost complete recovery of sensorimotor behaviour. Our results demonstrate that hUCB cells reinstall the way central neurons process information by normalizing inhibitory and excitatory processes. We propose that the intermediate level of cortical processing will become relevant as a new stage to investigate efficacy and mechanisms of cell therapy in the treatment of brain injury."

Along these lines, we have previously demonstrated that the micronutrient selenium increases macrophage production of arachidonic acid (AA)-derived anti-inflammatory 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) and decreases the proinflammatory PGE2. Here, we hypothesized that selenium modulated the metabolism of AA by a differential regulation of various prostaglandin (PG) synthases favoring the production of PGD2 metabolites, Δ12-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2. A dose-dependent increase in the expression of hematopoietic-PGD2 synthase (H-PGDS) by selenium and a corresponding increase in Δ12-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2 in RAW264.7 macrophages and primary bone marrow-derived macrophages was observed. Studies with organic non-bioavailable forms of selenium and the genetic manipulation of cellular selenium incorporation machinery indicated that selenoproteins were necessary for H-PGDS expression and 15d-PGJ2 production. Treatment of selenium-deficient macrophages with rosiglitazone, a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ ligand, up-regulated H-PGDS. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated the presence of an active peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-response element in murine Hpgds promoter suggesting a positive feedback mechanism of H-PGDS expression. Alternatively, the expression of nuclear factor-κB-dependent thromboxane synthase and microsomal PGE2 synthase was down-regulated by selenium. Using a Friend virus infection model of murine leukemia, the onset of leukemia was observed only in selenium-deficient and indomethacin-treated selenium-supplemented mice but not in the selenium-supplemented group or those treated with 15d-PGJ2.

Epidemiological studies suggest that inadequate selenium levels and associated reactive oxygen and nitrogen species production are linked to increased incidence of cardiovascular diseases, viral infections, including progression of HIV-AIDS and Alzheimer disease, infertility, and most notably cancer (2Rayman M.P.

Macrophages are cells of the immune system that are central to the progression of a physiological, protective inflammatory response into a pathological, tissue-destructive inflammatory state. An imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and the scavenging anti-oxidant mechanisms forms the basis for such progression (10Forman H.J. Torres M. Mol. Aspects Med. 2001; 22: 189-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). In addition to the oxidative (“respiratory”) burst reaction, classical macrophage activation is also characterized by the production of several mediators such as IL-1, IL-6, TNFα, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) (11Ma J.

PGE2, TXA2, PGD2, and PGD2 downstream products, Δ12-PGJ2 and 15d-PGJ2, are the major eicosanoids derived from the fatty acid arachidonic acid (AA) in macrophages (12Osterud B. Bjorklid E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1069-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), whereas PGI2 is predominantly produced by vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells that express high levels of PGI2 synthase (PGIS) (13Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Allen M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5922-5926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial step of prostaglandin (PG) synthesis involves formation of PGH2 from AA by the action of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2, which is subsequently acted upon by specific PG synthases, microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGES-1), thromboxane synthase (TXAS), and PGD synthase (PGDS), to form PGE2, TXA2, and PGD2, respectively (12Osterud B. Bjorklid E. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1069-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that during the resolution phase of inflammation, the AA metabolism shifts from the production of PGE2 toward that of PGD2 and its downstream double-dehydration product, 15d-PGJ2 (13Smith W.L.

This warrants further research into the regulation of the AA-COX pathway, which includes the various PG synthase enzymes. Oxidative stress in cells activates the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). NF-κB serves as a key transcription factor for mPGES-1 and TXAS, leading to the up-regulation of PGE2 and TXA2, respectively (14Stachowska E. Dolegowska B. Dziedziejko V. Rybicka M. Kaczmarczyk M.

While the former is expressed mainly in the CNS, the latter is found in immune cells like macrophages and mast cells, suggesting a role of H-PGDS in the regulation of inflammation (19Rajakariar R. Hilliard M. Lawrence T. Trivedi S. Colville-Nash P. Bellingan G. Fitzgerald D. Yaqoob M.M. Gilroy D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PGD2 and 15d-PGJ2 have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties, which are conferred via different mechanisms, including the activation of DP2 receptor, PPARγ activation, and covalent modification of cysteine thiols in target proteins such as IKKβ and p65 of the NF-κB signaling axis (20Herlong J.L. Scott T.R. Immunol. Lett. 2006; 102: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Kim E.H. Surh Y.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2006; 72: 1516-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, not much is known about the molecular regulation of the glutathione (GSH)-dependent sigma-class glutathione S-transferase, H-PGDS. Studies from multiple laboratories, ours included, suggest that AA pathway is redox-sensitive (17Zamamiri-Davis F. Lu Y. Thompson J.T. Prabhu K.S. Reddy P.V. Sordillo L.M. Reddy C.C. Free Radic.

Selenium has been shown to modulate the expression of TXAS and prostacyclin synthase (PGIS) in endothelial cells (24Cao Y.Z. Reddy C.C. Sordillo L.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, our laboratory has previously reported that selenium exerts its anti-inflammatory effects in activated macrophages via the enhanced production of 15d-PGJ2 in a COX-1-dependent manner (25Vunta H. Davis F. Palempalli U.D. Bhat D. Arner R.J. Thompson J.T. Peterson D.G. Reddy C.C. Prabhu K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 17964-17973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). This led us to the hypothesis that H-PGDS is regulated by the redox state of macrophages, which depends largely on their selenium status as well as the differential modulation of PPARγ and NF-κB. Here, we demonstrate that selenium supplementation of macrophages differentially regulates the expression of mPGES-1, TXAS, and H-PGDS to favor the shunting of AA through the H-PGDS pathway where selenoproteins are indispensable. Furthermore, we present data that validate the shunting of PG metabolism using a mouse model of leukemia upon infection by Friend virus (FV), a retrovirus that infects hematopoietic progenitors in the bone marrow and spleen to cause development of leukemia (26Lee C.R. Cervi D. Truong A.H. Li Y.J. Sarkar A. Ben-David Y. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 2159-2166PubMed Google Scholar). In this model, resistance of selenium-supplemented mice to FV infection was overcome with indomethacin treatment, although treatment with 15d-PGJ2, but not PGE2, completely rescued the selenium-supplemented mice despite inhibition of the AA pathway. Taken together, our data highlight the clinical significance of selenium-dependent shunting of AA toward PGD2 metabolites. Sodium selenite, methylseleninic acid (MSA), l-selenomethionine (Se-Met), bacterial lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli 0111:B4), ebselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzoselenazol-3-one), indomethacin, and DMSO were obtained from Sigma. 1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene) selenocyanate (p-XSC) was provided by Dr. S. Amin, Pennsylvania State University College of Medicine (Hershey, PA). CAY10526, HQL-79, 15d-PGJ2, 11-deoxy-16,16-dimethyl-PGE2, and rosiglitazone were purchased from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Recombinant l-methioninase (rMETase) and parthenolide (PTN) were from Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA) and Calbiochem, respectively. Murine macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 (ATCC, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (ATCC), 2 mm l-glutamine (Cellgro, Manassas, VA), penicillin-G (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen). For routine culture, the cells were passaged every 3 days at a ratio of 1:10 as per the recommendations by ATCC. For experiments, the cells were seeded at a density of ∼500,000/well of a 6-well plate and cultured for 2–4 days depending on the treatments. Selenite and Se-Met were dissolved in sterile water. p-XSC, ebselen, parthenolide, CAY10526, rosiglitazone, and 15d-PGJ2 were dissolved in DMSO. The final concentration of DMSO in the cell culture medium was 0.1% v/v. Human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells were used for extracting nuclear proteins for the EMSA. They were cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, and penicillin/streptomycin. Primary murine macrophages (BMDMs) were prepared by extracting femoral bone marrow plugs from ∼3-month-old C57BL/6 mice maintained on selenium-deficient (0.01 ppm selenite), selenium-adequate (0.1 ppm selenite), and selenium-supplemented (0.4 ppm selenite) diets for 12 weeks. These cells were then cultured in the same medium as described earlier with the addition of 20% L929 fibroblast-conditioned medium (as a source of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) for 1 week. Macrophages from selenium-deficient, selenium-adequate, and selenium-supplemented mice were cultured in defined media containing 7, 100, or 250 nm selenium (as selenite). For the FV-leukemia model, BALB/c mice (∼3 months old), maintained on selenium-deficient or selenium-supplemented diet (0.4 ppm selenite) for 12 weeks, were retro-orbitally injected with FV as described previously (27Subramanian A. Hegde S. Porayette P. Yon M. Hankey P. Paulson R.F. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 382-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These mice were dissected on day 15 post-infection, and signs of splenomegaly as well as WBC counts in the peripheral blood, characteristic of leukemia in this model (26Lee C.R. Cervi D. Truong A.H.

Genet. 1999; 23: 159-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), were examined. Hematological analysis was performed on an Advia 120 hematology autoanalyzer equipped with a veterinary software program. The COX inhibitor indomethacin was administered to the mice at a concentration of 0.00325% (w/v) in drinking water, as described previously (29Hashimoto K. Sheller J.R. Morrow J.D. Collins R.D. Goleniewska K. O'Neal J. Zhou W. Ji S. Mitchell D.B. Graham B.S. Peebles Jr., R.S. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), from 2 weeks prior to FV injection until 2 weeks post-infection, when the animals were euthanized. 15d-PGJ2 or 11-deoxy-16,16-dimethyl-PGE2 was exogenously administered at a concentration of 0.025 mg/kg/day (dissolved in PBS) intraperitoneally from day 7 to 14 post-infection to the respective groups. The special diets were formulated based on the recommended rodent diets from American Institute of Nutrition and purchased from Harlan-Teklad (Madison, WI). Cells cultured under different concentrations of sodium selenite (0–250 nm) were harvested and lysed with the mammalian protein extraction reagent (M-PER; Pierce) containing protease inhibitor mixture and 1 mm PMSF. Whole cell lysates were used for the GPX assay. The GPX activity was measured using H2O2 and NADPH, and the activity was expressed as nanomoles of NADPH oxidized per min per mg of protein in a spectrophotometric assay as described earlier (30Paglia D.E. Valentine W.N. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1967; 70: 158-169PubMed Google Scholar). Arginase activity, assessed by a colorimetric assay that detects urea production generated by arginase hydrolysis of l-Arg, has been described previously (31Corraliza I.M. Campo M.L. Soler G. Modolell M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). The selenium-deficient and selenium-adequate RAW264.7 macrophages assayed were cultured as described earlier. Absorbance at 560 nm was recorded on a Packard plate reader. A urea standard calibration curve (0–1 μmol; y = 9E-05x + 0.0007, R2 = 0.99) was used to calculate the arginase activity. Enzyme activity is expressed as micromoles of urea produced per mg of protein (31Corraliza I.M. Campo M.L. Soler G. Modolell M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates were prepared from RAW264.7 cells or BMDMs using M-PER containing protease inhibitors, and protein concentration was estimated by BCA reagent. An equal amount of protein (ranging from 5 to 25 μg) was electrophoresed on a 12.5% discontinuous SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The following primary antibodies were used to probe the membrane: anti-H-PGDS, anti-TXAS, anti-mPGES-1 (Cayman), anti-GPX1, anti-TR1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), and anti-GAPDH (Fitzgerald, Concord, MA). Appropriate secondary antibodies were used. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using the West Pico and/or West Femto chemiluminescence reagents obtained from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL). GAPDH was used as an internal control for normalization. Bands were evaluated by densitometry using the ImageJ software program (National Institutes of Health). RNA was isolated from RAW264.7 cells or BMDMs using the Isol-RNA lysis reagent (5 Prime, Gaithersburg, MD) as per its protocol. RNA purity and concentration were determined using UV spectroscopy. 2 μg of DNase (New England Biolabs)-treated RNA was used for reverse transcription reaction using High Capacity cDNA reverse transcriptase kit, per the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Prevalidated TaqMan probes for Hpgds, Mpges-1, Txas, and Pgis were purchased from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Gapdh probe was used as an internal control to normalize the data. Amplifications were performed using PerfeCTa quantitative PCR SuperMix master mix (Quanta Biosciences) in a 7300 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). ΔCt (CtGene − CtGapdh) was calculated for each sample and used for analysis of transcript abundance with respect to the untreated negative control as described previously (32Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127155) Google Scholar). For the semi-quantitative RT-PCR, the sequences of the primers were as follows: mouse Hpgds sense 5′-ATGCCTAACTACAAACTGCTT-3′ and antisense 5′-CTAGAGTTTTGTCTGTGGCCT-3′; mouse Gpx1 sense 5′-ACAGTCCACCGTGTATGCCTTC-3′ and antisense 5′-CTCTTCATTCTTGCCATTCTCCTG-3′; and mouse β-actin sense 5′-TGGAATCCTGTGGCATCCATGAAAC-3′ and antisense 5′-TAAAACGCAGCTCAGTAACAGTCCG-3′. PCR was carried out using 0.2 μm of primers, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate, 1.25 units of GoTaq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), and 2.5 ng of template cDNA. After initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min, PCR was continued with amplification cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 56 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C, followed by elongation for 5 min at 72 °C. The yield of PCR products was tested to be in the linear range, and optimal cycle number was chosen. The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel and visualized by UV transillumination. β-Actin was used as an internal control for normalization. Bands were evaluated by densitometry using the ImageJ program. siRNA for SectRNA synthetase was obtained as ON-TARGET plus SMART pool (Thermo Scientific Dharmacon). 2 μg of siRNA was transfected into 2 × 106 RAW264.7 cells using Nucleofector Solution V according to the manufacturer's specifications (Amaxa Biosystems). AllStars Negative Control siRNA (Qiagen) was used in equal amounts as a control. Selenite was added 12 h after transfection at a final concentration of 100 nm, and cells were harvested at 36 h after transfection for analysis by immunoblotting. The pU6-TetO4m4 vector containing shRNA target sequence, 5′-GACGTAGAGTTGGCATACC-3′ (nucleotides 694–712) for selenophosphate synthetase 2 (SPS2), was obtained from Dr. Dolph L. Hatfield, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda. The control vector was designated pU6Tet control, which consisted of the same construct minus the target sequence. For transfection, RAW264.7 macrophages were seeded into 6-well plates (1 × 106 cells/well) without antibiotics. After 24 h, cells were transfected with either shSPS2 or empty vector using TransIT®-LT1 (Mirus Bio) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The constructs were used at a final concentration of 2.5 μg/well. Forty eight hours after transfection, cells were left in the media with or without 250 nm selenite for 48 h followed by 12 h of 1 μg/ml LPS stimulation. Cells and media supernatants were collected for 15d-PGJ2 quantitation, and the corresponding cell lysates were used for Western immunoblotting analyses. SPS2 knockdown stable RAW264.7 cells were also prepared by transfecting the shSPS2 or the empty vector as described above. Resistant clones were selected in 100 μg/ml hygromycin and then expanded, followed by culturing them in a selenite-containing media to examine the knockdown of selenoproteins. Western blot analysis of SPS-2 confirmed ∼80% knockdown. Approximately 60% confluent HEK293T cells in a 60-mm culture dish were transfected with 6 μg of pCDNA3.1 containing human PPARγ full-length cDNA (provided by Dr. Jack Vanden Heuvel, Pennsylvania State University) using TransIT®-293 (Mirus Bio) transfection reagent. Rosiglitazone was added 24 h later to a final concentration of 2 μm for the expressed PPARγ to translocate into the nucleus. After 24 h, cells were harvested to prepare nuclear extracts. Cytoplasmic fraction was separated from the nuclei by lysing the HEK293T cells in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was then lysed with a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (see above). The lysates were sonicated (three pulses) at 60% power on ice and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Concentrations of proteins in this nuclear extract were determined using BCA reagent (Pierce). The DNA sequences for the sense strand of the oligonucleotides included the following: consensus PPRE (cPPRE) 5′-GGTGAGGAGGGGAAGGGTCAGTGTG-3′; PPRE1 5′-CTTATTAGGGTTAAAGGTCTAAA-3′; PPRE2 5′-TGAGGTGAGGTTAATGGACACAG-3′; PPRE3 5′-TGTAGAAGGGAGAAAGCTCAAAA-3′; and PPRE4 5′-ATGCACGAGTCCAAAGTTCAGCC-3′. Complementary strands were annealed, and 4 pmol/μl of the resultant double-stranded oligonucleotide was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mol at 10 mCi/ml) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). 32P-Labeled oligonucleotides were separated using gel filtration G-25 macro spin columns (The Nest Group Inc., Southborough, MA). For the binding reaction, 10 μg of nuclear extracts were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 5× gel-shift binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm DTT, 2.5 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 500 ng/ml BSA), 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC), and 32P-labeled PPRE oligonucleotides (20,000 cpm). In addition, a competitive binding assay between labeled PPRE1 and unlabeled consensus PPRE (at different ratios) was also performed. 2 μg of anti-PPARγ antibody (Cayman) was used for the supershift reaction. The samples were analyzed by PAGE (% T = 4) at 120 V for 45–50 min in TBE buffer. After drying, the gel was exposed to x-ray film overnight at −80 °C. The PPARγ bands were confirmed by competition using a >100-fold excess of corresponding unlabeled oligonucleotide. The concentrations of PGE2 and TXB2 in culture media supernatants of BMDMs and RAW264.7 cells treated with selenium as indicated and treated with 1 μg/ml LPS were determined by enzyme immunoassay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cayman) and normalized to total cellular protein. 15d-PGJ2 was quantitated from supernatants from RAW264.7 cells transiently transfected with shSPS2 by using enzyme immunoassay kit from Assay Designs (Ann Arbor, MI). In most cases, the values were normalized to total cell protein. The RAW264.7 or BMDM cell culture supernatants were acidified with HCl (1 n) to pH 3.0 and extracted with ethyl acetate. The compounds 15d-PGJ2 and Δ12-PGJ2 were analyzed using an LC-MS/MS system comprising of Shimadzu LC20AD UFLC pumps and API2000 triple quadruple mass spectrometer set to negative mode with a temperature of 200 °C for the confirmation of molecular ions. The solvent system used was methanol/H2O (70:30) with 0.1% acetic acid at a flow rate of 0.15 ml/min. The MS analysis was performed on API2000 set to scan mode (m/z 100–350) for authentic standards, and molecular ions m/z 315.6 (M − H+) for 15d-PGJ2 and 333.5 (M − H+) for Δ12-PGJ2, respectively, were used for quantitation. As an internal control to calculate extraction efficiency, 200 ng of deuterated 15d-PGJ2(d4) (Cayman Chemicals) was used, which showed a 70% extraction efficiency. Standard calibration curves for 15d-PGJ2 and Δ12-PGJ2 were set up for the quantitation, and calculations were performed based on the following equations: y = 76.831x − 608.42; r2 = 0.9927 (for 15d-PGJ2) and y = 7.2516x + 172.34; r2 = 0.9871 (for Δ12-PGJ2). As described earlier, the values were normalized to total cell protein. The results are expressed as means ± S.E. The differences between groups were analyzed by Student's t test using GraphPad Prism. The criterion for"
https://openalex.org/W2064494807,"Movement is the enemy of camouflage: most attempts at concealment are disrupted by motion of the target. Faced with this problem, navies in both World Wars in the twentieth century painted their warships with high contrast geometric patterns: so-called ""dazzle camouflage"". Rather than attempting to hide individual units, it was claimed that this patterning would disrupt the perception of their range, heading, size, shape and speed, and hence reduce losses from, in particular, torpedo attacks by submarines. Similar arguments had been advanced earlier for biological camouflage. Whilst there are good reasons to believe that most of these perceptual distortions may have occurred, there is no evidence for the last claim: changing perceived speed. Here we show that dazzle patterns can distort speed perception, and that this effect is greatest at high speeds. The effect should obtain in predators launching ballistic attacks against rapidly moving prey, or modern, low-tech battlefields where handheld weapons are fired from short ranges against moving vehicles. In the latter case, we demonstrate that in a typical situation involving an RPG7 attack on a Land Rover the reduction in perceived speed is sufficient to make the grenade miss where it was aimed by about a metre, which could be the difference between survival or not for the occupants of the vehicle."
https://openalex.org/W2060936398,"[FeFe] hydrogenases are promising catalysts for producing hydrogen as a sustainable fuel and chemical feedstock, and they also serve as paradigms for biomimetic hydrogen-evolving compounds. Hydrogen formation is catalyzed by the H-cluster, a unique iron-based cofactor requiring three carbon monoxide (CO) and two cyanide (CN−) ligands as well as a dithiolate bridge. Three accessory proteins (HydE, HydF, and HydG) are presumably responsible for assembling and installing the H-cluster, yet their precise roles and the biosynthetic pathway have yet to be fully defined. In this report, we describe effective cell-free methods for investigating H-cluster synthesis and [FeFe] hydrogenase activation. Combining isotopic labeling with FTIR spectroscopy, we conclusively show that each of the CO and CN− ligands derive respectively from the carboxylate and amino substituents of tyrosine. Such in vitro systems with reconstituted pathways comprise a versatile approach for studying biosynthetic mechanisms, and this work marks a significant step towards an understanding of both the protein-protein interactions and complex reactions required for H-cluster assembly and hydrogenase maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2076730460,"Background Mass strandings of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) remain peculiar and rather unexplained events, which rarely occur in the Mediterranean Sea. Solar cycles and related changes in the geomagnetic field, variations in water temperature and weather conditions, coast geographical features and human activities have been proposed as possible causes. In December 2009, a pod of seven male sperm whales stranded along the Adriatic coast of Southern Italy. This is the sixth instance from 1555 in this basin. Methodology/Principal Findings Complete necropsies were performed on three whales whose bodies were in good condition, carrying out on sampled tissues histopathology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, and screening of veins looking for gas emboli. Furthermore, samples for age determination, genetic studies, gastric content evaluation, stable isotopes and toxicology were taken from all the seven specimens. The animals were part of the same group and determined by genetic and photo-identification to be part of the Mediterranean population. Causes of death did not include biological agents, or the “gas and fat embolic syndrome”, associated with direct sonar exposure. Environmental pollutant tissue concentrations were relatively high, in particular organochlorinated xenobiotics. Gastric content and morphologic tissue examinations showed a prolonged starvation, which likely caused, at its turn, the mobilization of lipophilic contaminants from the adipose tissue. Chemical compounds subsequently entered the blood circulation and may have impaired immune and nervous functions. Conclusions/Significance A multi-factorial cause underlying this sperm whales' mass stranding is proposed herein based upon the results of postmortem investigations as well as of the detailed analyses of the geographical and historical background. The seven sperm whales took the same “wrong way” into the Adriatic Sea, a potentially dangerous trap for Mediterranean sperm whales. Seismic surveys should be also regarded as potential co-factors, even if no evidence of direct impact has been detected."
https://openalex.org/W2104196299,"C-reactive protein (CRP) has been implicated in the regulation of inflammation underlying coronary artery disease; however, little is known about the molecular mechanisms responsible for the expression of its pro- or anti-inflammatory activities. Here, we have identified the intrasubunit disulfide bond as a conserved switch that controls the structure and functions of CRP. Conformational rearrangement in human pentameric CRP to monomeric CRP (mCRP) is the prerequisite for this switch to be activated by reducing agents, including thioredoxin. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed 36-79% colocalization of thioredoxin and mCRP in human advanced coronary atherosclerotic lesions. Nonreduced mCRP was largely inert in activating human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAECs), whereas reduced or cysteine-mutated mCRP evoked marked release of IL-8 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 from HCAECs, with ~50% increase at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Reduced mCRP was ~4 to 40-fold more potent than mCRP in up-regulating adhesion molecule expression, promoting U937 monocyte adhesion to HCAECs, and inducing cytokine release from rabbit arteries ex vivo and in mice. These actions were primarily due to unlocking the lipid raft interaction motif. Therefore, expression of proinflammatory properties of CRP on endothelial cells requires sequential conformational changes, i.e., loss of pentameric symmetry followed by reduction of the intrasubunit disulfide bond."
https://openalex.org/W2155867164,"Malaria is a vector-borne infectious disease caused by unicellular, obligate intracellular parasites of the genus Plasmodium. During host switch the malaria parasite employs specialized latent stages that colonize the new host environment. Previous work has established that gametocytes, sexually differentiated stages that are taken up by the mosquito vector, control expression of genes required for mosquito colonization by translational repression. Sexual parasite development is controlled by a DEAD-box RNA helicase of the DDX6 family, termed DOZI. Latency of sporozoites, the transmission stage injected during an infectious blood meal, is controlled by the eIF2alpha kinase IK2, a general inhibitor of protein synthesis. Whether RNA-binding proteins participate in translational regulation in sporozoites remains to be studied. Here, we investigated the roles of two RNA-binding proteins of the Puf-family, Plasmodium Puf1 and Puf2, during sporozoite stage conversion. Our data reveal that, in the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei, Puf2 participates in the regulation of IK2 and inhibits premature sporozoite transformation. Inside mosquito salivary glands puf2⁻ sporozoites transform over time to round forms resembling early intra-hepatic stages. As a result, mutant parasites display strong defects in initiating a malaria infection. In contrast, Puf1 is dispensable in vivo throughout the entire Plasmodium life cycle. Our findings support the notion of a central role for Puf2 in parasite latency during switch between the insect and mammalian hosts."
https://openalex.org/W1985613448,"For prevention of HIV infection many currently licensed anti-HIV drugs and new ones in the pipeline show potential as topically applied microbicides. While macaque models have been the gold standard for in vivo microbicide testing, they are expensive and sufficient numbers are not available. Therefore, a small animal model that facilitates rapid evaluation of potential candidates for their preliminary efficacy is urgently needed in the microbicide field. We previously demonstrated that RAG-hu humanized mouse model permits HIV-1 mucosal transmission via both vaginal and rectal routes and that oral pre-exposure chemo-prophylactic strategies could be tested in this system. Here in these proof-of-concept studies, we extended this system for topical microbicide testing using HIV-1 as the challenge virus. Maraviroc, a clinically approved CCR5 inhibitor drug for HIV treatment, was formulated as a microbicide gel at 5 mM concentration in 2.2% hydroxyl ethyl cellulose. Female RAG-hu mice were challenged vaginally with HIV-1 an hour after intravaginal application of the maraviroc gel. Our results showed that maraviroc gel treated mice were fully protected against vaginal HIV-1 challenge in contrast to placebo gel treated mice which all became infected. These findings highlight the utility of the humanized mouse models for microbicide testing and, together with the recent data from macaque studies, suggest that maraviroc is a promising candidate for future microbicide clinical trials in the field."
https://openalex.org/W1984080658,"Background TDP-43 is an RNA- and DNA-binding protein well conserved in animals including the mammals, Drosophila, and C. elegans. In mammals, the multi-function TDP-43 encoded by the TARDBP gene is a signature protein of the ubiquitin-positive inclusions (UBIs) in the diseased neuronal/glial cells of a range of neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD-U). Methodology/Principal Findings We have studied the function and dysfunction of the Drosophila ortholog of the mammalian TARDBP gene, dTDP, by genetic, behavioral, molecular, and cytological analyses. It was found that depletion of dTDP expression caused locomotion defect accompanied with an increase of the number of boutons at the neuromuscular junctions (NMJ). These phenotypes could be rescued by overexpression of Drosophila dTDP in the motor neurons. In contrast, overexpression of dTDP in the motor neurons also resulted in reduced larval and adult locomotor activities, but this was accompanied by a decrease of the number of boutons and axon branches at NMJ. Significantly, constitutive overexpression of dTDP in the mushroom bodies caused smaller axonal lobes as well as severe learning deficiency. On the other hand, constitutive mushroom body-specific knockdown of dTDP expression did not affect the structure of the mushroom bodies, but it impaired the learning ability of the flies, albeit moderately. Overexpression of dTDP also led to the formation of cytosolic dTDP (+) aggregates. Conclusion/Significance These data together demonstrate the neuronal functions of dTDP, and by implication the mammalian TDP-43, in learning and locomotion. The effects of mis-expression of dTDP on Drosophila NMJ suggest that eukaryotic TDP-43 guards against over development of the synapses. The conservation of the regulatory pathways of functions and dysfunctions of Drosophila dTDP and mammalian TDP-43 also shows the feasibility of using the flies as a model system for studying the normal TDP-43 function and TDP-43 proteinopathies in the vertebrates including human."

Recent studies have highlighted thyroid hormone analogs and derivatives as potential agents able to counteract such pathologies. In this study, in rats receiving a high-fat diet (HFD), we analyzed the effects of a 4-wk daily administration of a naturally occurring iodothyronine, 3,5-diiodo-L-thyronine (T2), on the gastrocnemius muscle metabolic/structural phenotype and insulin signaling. The HFD-induced increases in muscle levels of fatty acid translocase (3-fold; P<0.05) and TGs (2-fold, P<0.05) were prevented by T2 (each; P<0.05 vs. HFD). T2 increased insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation levels (∼2.5-fold; P<0.05 vs. HFD). T2 induced these effects while sparing muscle mass and without cardiac hypertrophy. T2 increased the muscle contents of fast/glycolytic fibers (2-fold; P<0.05 vs. HFD) and sarcolemmal glucose transporter 4 (3-fold; P<0.05 vs. HFD). Adipocyte differentiation-related protein was predominantly present within the slow/oxidative fibers in HFD-T2. In T2-treated rats (vs. HFD), glycolytic enzymes and associated components were up-regulated (proteomic analysis, significance limit: 2-fold; P<0.05), as was phosphofructokinase activity (by 1.3-fold; P<0.05), supporting the metabolic shift toward a more glycolytic phenotype. These results highlight T2 as a potential therapeutic approach to the treatment of diet-induced metabolic dysfunctions."
https://openalex.org/W2124776391,"Calcium is an essential ion serving a multitude of physiological roles. Aside from its role as a second messenger, it is an essential component of the vertebrate bone matrix. Efficient uptake and storage of calcium are therefore indispensable for all vertebrates. Transient receptor potential family, vanilloid type (TRPV)5 and TRPV6 channels are known players in transcellular calcium uptake, but the exact contribution of this pathway is unclear. We used forward genetic screening in zebrafish (Danio rerio) to identify genes essential in bone formation and identified a lethal zebrafish mutant (matt-und-schlapp) with severe defects in bone formation, including lack of ossification of the vertebral column and craniofacial structures. Mutant embryos show a 68% reduction in calcium content, and systemic calcium homeostasis is disturbed when compared with siblings. The phenotype can be partially rescued by increasing ambient calcium levels to 25 mM. We identified the mutation as a loss-of-function mutation in the single orthologue of TRPV5 and 6, trpv5/6. Expression in HEK293 cells showed that Trpv5/6 is a calcium-selective channel capable of inward calcium transport at physiological concentrations whereas the mutant channel is not. Taken together, this study provides both genetic and functional evidence that transcellular epithelial calcium uptake is vital to sustain life and enable bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W1969440422,"Omega-3 (ω3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are major components of brain cells membranes. ω3 PUFA-deficient rodents exhibit severe cognitive impairments (learning, memory) that have been linked to alteration of brain glucose utilization or to changes in neurotransmission processes. ω3 PUFA supplementation has been shown to lower anxiety and to improve several cognitive parameters in rodents, while very few data are available in primates. In humans, little is known about the association between anxiety and ω3 fatty acids supplementation and data are divergent about their impact on cognitive functions. Therefore, the development of nutritional studies in non-human primates is needed to disclose whether a long-term supplementation with long-chain ω3 PUFA has an impact on behavioural and cognitive parameters, differently or not from rodents. We address the hypothesis that ω3 PUFA supplementation could lower anxiety and improve cognitive performances of the Grey Mouse Lemur (Microcebus murinus), a nocturnal Malagasy prosimian primate. Adult male mouse lemurs were fed for 5 months on a control diet or on a diet supplemented with long-chain ω3 PUFA (n = 6 per group). Behavioural, cognitive and motor performances were measured using an open field test to evaluate anxiety, a circular platform test to evaluate reference spatial memory, a spontaneous locomotor activity monitoring and a sensory-motor test. ω3-supplemented animals exhibited lower anxiety level compared to control animals, what was accompanied by better performances in a reference spatial memory task (80% of successful trials vs 35% in controls, p<0.05), while the spontaneous locomotor activity was reduced by 31% in ω3-supplemented animals (p<0.001), a parameter that can be linked with lowered anxiety. The long-term dietary ω3 PUFA supplementation positively impacts on anxiety and cognitive performances in the adult mouse lemur. The supplementation of human food with ω3 fatty acids may represent a valuable dietary strategy to improve behavioural and cognitive functions."
https://openalex.org/W2050605153,"The regulatory protein ToxT is an AraC family protein that is responsible for activating transcription of the genes encoding cholera toxin and toxin coregulated pilus, which are required for virulence by the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae. The N terminus of ToxT contains dimerization and regulatory elements, whereas the C terminus contains the DNA binding domain. Bile and long chain fatty acids negatively regulate ToxT activity. Utilizing a comprehensive alanine substitution mutant library of ToxT, 19 N-terminal residues were found to be critical for dimerization and transcriptional activation. One of these mutant proteins (F151A) was confirmed to be monomeric via centrifugation and exhibited a weakened ability to bind to the tcpA promoter in a gel mobility shift assay. Moreover, a V. cholerae toxTF151A mutant failed to colonize the infant mouse intestine, emphasizing the importance of ToxT N-terminal dimerization to cholera pathogenesis. Six N-terminal alanine substitutions allowed ToxT transcriptional activity in the presence of inhibitory concentrations of bile, palmitoleic acid, and the small molecule inhibitor virstatin. Two of these mutations (N106A and L114A) enhance N-terminal dimerization in a bacterial two-hybrid system reconstituted in V. cholerae, which is otherwise disrupted by bile, palmitoleic acid, and virstatin. We demonstrate that V. cholerae toxTN106A and toxTL114A strains colonize the infant mouse intestine at significantly higher levels than the wild type strain. Our results demonstrate that ToxT N-terminal dimerization is required for transcriptional activation and cholera pathogenesis and that fatty acids modulate ToxT activity via modulation of dimerization.

Vibrio cholerae causes the disease cholera, a life-threatening diarrheal illness that affects thousands of people annually (1Wkly Epidemiol. Rec. 2010; 85: 117-128PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterium is acquired through the consumption of contaminated food or water and colonizes the small intestine (2Holmgren J. Svennerholm A.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1977; 136: S105-S112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the intestinal environment, V. cholerae expresses two critical virulence factors that facilitate colonization and disease symptoms, cholera toxin (CT) 2The abbreviations used are: CTcholera toxinMBPmaltose-binding proteinTEVtobacco etch virusC.I.competitive indexPOApalmitoleic acidTCPtoxin-coregulated pilusIPTGisopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. and toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). CT is an ADP-ribosylating toxin that is translocated into host cells and modifies Gsα, causing an ion imbalance that leads to the profuse diarrhea associated with the disease (2Holmgren J. Svennerholm A.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1977; 136: S105-S112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TCP is a type IV bundle-forming pilus that is required for intestinal colonization (3Taylor R.K. Miller V.L.

Expression of CT and TCP is coordinately regulated by the transcriptional activator ToxT (4DiRita V.J. Parsot C. Jander G. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1991; 88: 5403-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). ToxT, an AraC/XylS family activator, directly binds to the promoters of the ctx and tcp genes (which encode CT and TCP) and activates their transcription (5Yu R.R. DiRita V.J. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 119-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). V. cholerae strains lacking ToxT express no CT or TCP and are unable to colonize the intestine and cause disease, emphasizing the central role this regulatory protein plays in cholera pathogenesis (6DiRita V.J. Neely M. Taylor R.K. Bruss P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 7991-7995Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Transcription of toxT is regulated by a virulence cascade commonly referred to as the ToxR regulon, which responds to various environmental stimuli to ensure that ToxT is only expressed within the intestine (7Childers B.M. Klose K.E. Future Microbiol. 2007; 2: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). ToxT is composed of two domains, an N-terminal domain (amino acids 1–164) that contains dimerization determinants and environmentally responsive elements and a C-terminal domain (amino acids 165–276) that contains the DNA-binding determinants (two HTH motifs) that share homology with other AraC family members (8Prouty M.G. Osorio C.R. Klose K.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Lowden M.J. Skorupski K. Pellegrini M. Chiorazzo M.G. Taylor R.K. Kull F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The N terminus has been demonstrated to dimerize by dominant inhibition, LexA fusion, and two-hybrid analyses (8Prouty M.G. Osorio C.R. Klose K.E. Mol.

The C terminus is able to bind to the tcp promoter region in a gel mobility shift assay but only when it is fused to a heterologous dimerization domain (8Prouty M.G. Osorio C.R. Klose K.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that ToxT must be dimerized to activate transcription. However, the isolated (monomeric) C terminus has been shown to bind to the mshA promoter region, which is repressed by ToxT, suggesting that monomeric ToxT, although not transcriptionally active, can still bind certain promoters and repress their expression (13Hsiao A. Xu X. Kan B. Kulkarni R.V. Zhu J. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Evidence has accumulated that ToxT transcriptional activity is modulated by environmental conditions found within the intestine. Initially, bile was shown to negatively modulate ToxT-dependent transcription activation (14Schuhmacher D.A. Klose K.E. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1508-1514Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, fractionation of bile components revealed that fatty acids present in bile, such as oleic acid, repressed ToxT-dependent ctx and tcp transcription (15Chatterjee A. Dutta P.K. Chowdhury R. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 1946-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Capsaicin, the vanilloid compound isolated from chili peppers, is also capable of repressing ToxT-dependent ctx and tcp transcription (16Chatterjee S. Asakura M. Chowdhury N. Neogi S.B. Sugimoto N. Haldar S. Awasthi S.P. Hinenoya A. Aoki S. Yamasaki S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2010; 306: 54-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), as is a synthetic small molecule inhibitor, virstatin (17Hung D.T. Shakhnovich E.A. Pierson E. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 2005; 310: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The recent resolution of the ToxT crystal structure revealed a monomer tightly bound to palmitoleic acid (POA) (9Lowden M.J. Skorupski K. Pellegrini M. Chiorazzo M.G. Taylor R.K. Kull F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2860-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), and this is presumed to be an inactive state, because POA disrupts ToxT DNA binding activity and transcription activation. POA is completely buried within the monomer, sandwiched between the N and C termini, leading to a model that predicts that certain fatty acids, such as POA, modulate ToxT dimerization, and hence activity, by binding ToxT and “locking” ToxT into a monomeric and inactive state (closed conformation) (9Lowden M.J. Skorupski K. Pellegrini M. Chiorazzo M.G. Taylor R.K. Kull F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 2860-2865Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 10Shakhnovich E.A. Hung D.T. Pierson E. Lee K. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We previously performed comprehensive scanning alanine mutagenesis on ToxT (11Childers B.M. Weber G.G. Prouty M.G. Castaneda M.M. Peng F. Klose K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1413-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and we have used this mutant library to identify residues important for dimerization and modulation by fatty acids. We demonstrate that bile, POA, virstatin, capsaicin, and other fatty acids inhibit ToxT activity by a common mechanism, namely inhibition of N-terminal dimerization. Our results confirm a tight correlation between ToxT dimerization and virulence. Escherichia coli strains DH5α and DH5αλpir were used for cloning (18Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8190) Google Scholar); strain WM3046 (gift of William Metcalf, University of Illinois) was used for conjugation; strain BL21(DE3)pLysS was used for overexpression of His-MBP-ToxT (19Miroux B. Walker J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 260: 289-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), and strain KDZif1Δz was used for the bacterial two-hybrid system (20Vallet-Gely I. Donovan K.E. Fang R. Joung J.K. Dove S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11082-11087Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All V. cholerae strains used are isogenic with the classical O1 strain O395. The V. cholerae two-hybrid reporter strain KKV2297 was created by first introducing the ΔtoxT::Cm and rpoZ mutations from strains SY1002 (21Yamamoto S. Izumiya H. Morita M. Arakawa E. Watanabe H. Gene. 2009; 438: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and EC14799 (22Cameron D.E. Urbach J.M. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 8736-8741Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) into O395 via CPT1ts transduction (23Hava D.L. Camilli A. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 46: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to create strain KKV2296, and then replacing the endogenous lacZ promoter in KKV2296 with the Zif-dependent promoter from KDZif1Δz via conjugation with plasmid pKEK1448, to create reporter strain KKV2297. The V. cholerae toxT mutant strains were created by first introducing the ΔtoxT::Cm mutation from strain SY1002 (21Yamamoto S. Izumiya H. Morita M. Arakawa E. Watanabe H. Gene. 2009; 438: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) into the ΔlacZ O395 strain KKV598 via CPT1ts transduction (23Hava D.L. Camilli A. J. Microbiol. Methods. 2001; 46: 217-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to create strain KKV2287, and then replacing the ΔtoxT::Cm with the various mutant forms of toxT via conjugation (24Skorupski K. Taylor R.K. Gene. 1996; 169: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) with plasmids pKEK1445, pKEK1496, pKEK1497, pKEK1498, and pKEK1499 to create strains KKV2289 (toxTwt), KKV2291 (toxTN106A), KKV2292 (toxTL114A), KKV2293 (toxTF151A), and KKV2294 (toxTS223K), respectively. Strains were grown overnight at 30 °C in LB to induce virulence factor expression. Plasmid pKEK160, which expresses MBP-ToxT from the pBAD promoter (25Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar), was used as template for site-directed mutagenesis with the primers listed in supplemental Table S1 to introduce the various ToxT mutations. The two-hybrid plasmids pKEK1443 and pKEK1444 were created by cloning the coding sequence for ToxT amino acids 1–167 into the NdeI and NotI sites of pACTR-AP-Zif and pBRGP-ω (20Vallet-Gely I. Donovan K.E. Fang R. Joung J.K. Dove S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11082-11087Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), using primers ToxTN Up KDZif and ToxTN Dn 167 (supplemental Table S1). These plasmids were subsequently modified by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange kit (Stratagene) with the primers listed in supplemental Table S1 to introduce the various ToxT mutations. The plasmid used to create the chromosomal toxT mutant V. cholerae strains was constructed by PCR amplification of toxT and 1-kb flanking region on each side using primers ToxT Flank Up NotI and ToxT Flank Dn NotI (supplemental Table S1) and then cloning the resulting fragment into the NotI site of pKAS46 (24Skorupski K. Taylor R.K. Gene. 1996; 169: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) to create pKEK1445. This plasmid was used in site-directed mutagenesis with the appropriate primers listed in supplemental Table S1 to introduce the F151A, N106A, L114A, and S223K mutations, which were subsequently introduced into the V. cholerae chromosome. The plasmid used to construct the V. cholerae two-hybrid reporter strain was created by first amplifying a splicing by overlap extension PCR product (26Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2641) Google Scholar) consisting of 1 kb of DNA upstream of the V. cholerae lacZ translation start site, the chloramphenicol resistance gene flanked by KasI and NdeI sites, and the DNA corresponding to 1 kb of the V. cholerae lacZ gene from the start codon. This product was created using the primers LacZ Up PstI, LacZ Dn PstI, Uni Up, Uni Dn, LacZp Uni Dn, and LacZp Uni Up (supplemental Table S1) (27Liu J. Zogaj X. Barker J.R. Klose K.E. BioTechniques. 2007; 43: 487-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and cloning into the plasmid pGEM-T to form pKEK1446. The Zif-dependent promoter region from KDZif1Δz was then PCR-amplified with primers KanZifrrnB Up and KanZifrrnB Dn, digested with KasI and NdeI, and ligated to pKEK1446 digested similarly, to create pKEK1447. The entire construct was then amplified using LacZp Up PstI Up and LacZp Dn PstI and cloned into pDS132 (28Philippe N. Alcaraz J.P. Coursange E. Geiselmann J. Schneider D. Plasmid. 2004; 51: 246-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) digested similarly to create pKEK1448. pKEK1455, carrying the full V. cholerae lacZ gene, and 1-kb flanking homology on each side, was created by PCR amplification of this region from the wild type chromosome using primers LacZ Replace Up BamHI and LacZ Replace SacI and then cloning the resultant fragment into the BamHI and SacI sites of pKAS46. The genes encoding the full-length wild type, N106A, and F151A ToxT proteins were cloned into a modified pMal-c2x plasmid (New England Biolabs) and expressed as fusions with maltose-binding protein (MBP). The N-terminal MBP and C-terminal ToxT components were separated by a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site and the MBP component also possessed a 6× histidine tag fused to its N terminus. The MBP-ToxT fusion proteins were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3)pLysS at 37 °C. Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.6 before induction using 1 mm IPTG. The cells were shaken overnight before being harvested by centrifugation. The pelleted cells were resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5 (column buffer), and lysed by sonication on ice. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation, and cleared lysate was loaded onto an amylose resin (New England Biolabs), washed with 5 volumes of column buffer, and eluted with column buffer made 10 mm in maltose. Fractions containing the MBP-ToxT fusion proteins were pooled, and His8-tagged TEV protease (purified in-house) was added such that the fusion protein:TEV protease ratio was 10:1 and allowed to incubate overnight. The resulting solutions were loaded onto a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (GE Healthcare) and the His6-MBP and His8-TEV protease components were retained, whereas the cleaved ToxT proteins were collected in the flow-through and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, pH 8.0. The free ToxT proteins were purified to homogeneity on a HiTrap Q anion exchange resin (GE Healthcare) for use in analytical ultracentrifugation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C using a Beckman Optima XL-I centrifuge. All samples were scanned in intensity mode at 280 nm. ToxT wild type was measured at 16.5 μm, corresponding to an absorbance of 0.79 A280, whereas ToxT mutant F151A was measured at a loading concentration both above and below that of the wild type, at 7.5 and 21.6 μm, corresponding to an absorbance of 0.36 and 1.03 A280. Measurements were performed at 50,000 rpm for the wild type, whereas ToxT F151A was measured at 40,000 rpm. Hydrodynamic parameters were corrected for buffer density, viscosity, and partial specific volume according to methods outlined by Laue et al. (29Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L.

Biophys. J. 2010; 39: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), followed by analysis with the enhanced van Holde-Weischet method (33Demeler B. van Holde K.E. Anal. Biochem. 2004; 335: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The two-dimensional spectrum analysis results were further refined by genetic algorithm (34Brookes E. Demeler B. Prog. Coll. Pol. Sci. S. 2006; 131: 33-40Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 35Brookes E.H. Demeler B. Gecco 2007: Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference. Vol. 2.

Analysis of sedimentation velocity data by the van Holde and Weischet method effectively removes the contribution of diffusion to boundary spreading to yield G(s), a model independent, integral distribution of s20,w of all species in the sample. Consequently, a G(s) plot of the boundary fraction versus s20,w is vertical when the sample is homogeneous and has a positive slope when the sample is heterogeneous (37Demeler B. Saber H. Hansen J.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 397-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The S value is directly proportional to molecular mass and inversely proportional to the frictional ratio (f/f0). The frictional ratio is 1 for a sphere and increases for elongated molecules (with values usually in the range of 1.25–2.5 (38Brookes E. Demeler B. Rosano C. Rocco M. Eur. Biophys. J. 2010; 39: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar)). The two-dimensional spectrum analysis and genetic algorithm methods further characterize each species in the distribution by partial concentration, frictional ratio, and molecular weight, and the Monte Carlo analysis provides statistical confidence limits for each parameter. For the bacterial two-hybrid assays, plasmids expressing ToxTN-Zif and ToxTN-ω were cotransformed into either KDZif1Δz or KKV2297. Overnight cultures of these strains were diluted 1:100 into LB containing 0.3 mm IPTG, with or without 0.4% bile, 0.1% POA, 0.01% virstatin, 0.05% 9-decenoic acid, 0.05% decanoic acid, 0.01% 7-octenoic acid, 0.05% myristoleic acid, 0.2% oleic acid, 1% elaidic acid, and 0.01% capsaicin, grown at 30 °C to A600 0.2–0.4, and assayed for β-galactosidase activity (39Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics: A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 71-74Google Scholar). To measure CT and TCP expression, overnight cultures of V. cholerae ΔtoxT strain VJ740 (40Champion G.A. Neely M.N. Brennan M.A. DiRita V.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) carrying plasmids expressing the various ToxT mutant proteins were diluted 1:100 in LB with 0.1% arabinose, with or without 0.4% bile, 0.1% POA, 0.01% virstatin, 0.05% 9-decenoic acid, 0.05% decanoic acid, 0.01% 7-octenoic acid, 0.05% myristoleic acid, 0.2% oleic acid, 1% elaidic acid, and 0.01% capsaicin, grown at 37 °C overnight, and then assayed for CT expression by GM1-ELISA (41Svennerholm A.M. Holmgren J. Curr. Microbiol. 1978; 1: 19-23Crossref Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and TCP expression by Western immunoblot with rabbit polyclonal antisera directed against TcpA, utilizing ECL detection reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Significance was calculated using Student's two-tailed t test. tcpAp probe was generated by first annealing complementary oligonucleotides based on the following sequence corresponding to tcpAp (only the 5′–3′ strand is shown): 5′-TCAACGTAAGTGTGTTATTAAAAAAATAAAAAAACACAGCAAAAAATGAGATCTGTC-3′. The double-stranded probe was labeled utilizing polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and then purified via a NucTrap column (Stratagene). Purified ToxT protein was mixed with labeled probe (20,000 cpm) and poly(dI-dC) (0.3 ng) in LSB (10 mm phosphate, 30 mm NaCl, 1 mm azide, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.0), incubated for 10 min at 37 °C, and loaded into a 6% (w/v) acrylamide 0.06% (w/v) bisacrylamide gel. Gels were electrophoresed in a Tris-glycine buffer (50 mm Tris base, 100 mm glycine, pH 8.5) and subsequently visualized by autoradiography. For specific competitor DNA, unlabeled annealed probe was used, whereas an unlabeled PCR product of the cat gene was used for nonspecific competitor DNA, as described previously (8Prouty M.G. Osorio C.R. Klose K.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). V. cholerae strains KKV2289 (O395 ΔlacZ), KKV2293 (toxTF151A ΔlacZ), KKV2291 (toxTN106A ΔlacZ), and KKV2292 (toxTL114A ΔlacZ) were each mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the wild type strain KKV2290 (O395 lacZ+) and then orally inoculated into 5-day-old CD-1 suckling mice (∼106 mutant/106 wild type). Bile was added to the relevant inocula at a final concentration of 0.04%. After 22 h of colonization, the small intestines were isolated and homogenized, and the mutant:wild type ratio was determined by plating dilutions on LB agar containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal). The competitive index was calculated as the ratio of mutant:wild type recovered from intestine divided by the ratio mutant:wild type inoculated into the animal. Significant differences in colonization were calculated using a nonparametric Mann-Whitney statistical test. We previously constructed a comprehensive scanning alanine mutant ToxT library, to identify residues critical for ToxT function (11Childers B.M. Weber G.G. Prouty M.G. Castaneda M.M. Peng F. Klose K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1413-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 20 Ala substitution mutations within the N terminus (amino acids 1–164) prevented transcriptional activity (<1% wild type activity) at two different ToxT-dependent promoters, indicating that these residues are essential for ToxT function. We and others have shown that the N terminus of ToxT dimerizes (8Prouty M.G. Osorio C.R. Klose K.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 1143-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 10Shakhnovich E.A.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), so we utilized a bacterial two-hybrid system to determine the effect these 20 Ala substitutions have upon N-terminal dimerization. This assay has been used previously to demonstrate ToxT N-terminal dimerization (10Shakhnovich E.A. Hung D.T. Pierson E. Lee K. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The ToxT N terminus was fused to both the ω subunit of E. coli RNA polymerase (ToxTN-ω) and a zinc finger DNA-binding protein (ToxTN-Zif), and interaction between the two fusion proteins was measured in an E. coli reporter strain with a Zif-dependent promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusion (20Vallet-Gely I. Donovan K.E. Fang R. Joung J.K. Dove S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 11082-11087Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously (10Shakhnovich E.A. Hung D.T. Pierson E. Lee K. Mekalanos J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the N termini of ToxT in these fusion proteins interact and induce lacZ transcription (Fig. 1). We then introduced each of the 20 N-terminal Ala substitutions that prevent ToxT activity (11Childers B.M. Weber G.G. Prouty M.G. Castaneda M.M. Peng F. Klose K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1413-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) into the ToxTN-Zif and ToxTN-ω fusion proteins, and we measured dimerization of each Ala substitution mutant paired with the cognate wild type ToxTN-fusion partner (Fig. 1). As a control, we also included the L114P mutation that was previously shown to disrupt ToxTN dimerization (17Hung D.T. Shakhnovich E.A. Pierson E. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 2005; 310: 670-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar) (this mutation was erroneously referred to as “L113P” in this study). These assays demonstrated that, like the L114P mutation, 19 of the 20 Ala substitutions within the N terminus disrupt dimerization and that these mutations are cis-acting, i.e. the Ala substitution only needs to be in one of the two interacting subunits to prevent dimerization. We also measured dimerization of ToxTN with a D141G mutation; this mutation was previously suggested to also disrupt dimerization (13Hsiao A. Xu X. Kan B. Kulkarni R.V. Zhu J. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 1383-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and our analysis confirmed that the D141G mutation disrupts ToxTN dimerization. These results identify 20 N-terminal residues (including Asp-141) that contribute to the dimerization and activity of ToxT. The E52A mutation was the only Ala substitution that disrupted ToxT activity but still allowed for high levels of dimerization in the bacterial two-hybrid assay. To determine whether this might be a trans-acting mutation (i.e. requires that the mutation be in both subunits to inhibit dimerization), we measured the ability of ToxTNE52A-Zif and ToxTNE52A-ω to interact in this assay (supplemental Fig. S1). The results demonstrate that even with the E52A mutation in both monomers, the N termini are still able to interact and stimulate ∼50% WT β-galactosidase activity, suggesting that the lack of transcriptional activity of the E52A mutant is not due to a major defect in dimerization. The F151A mutation was previously shown to inhibit ToxT dimerization in a LexA-based assay (11Childers B.M. Weber G.G. Prouty M.G. Castaneda M.M. Peng F. Klose K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 367: 1413-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and was confirmed to inhibit ToxT dimerization in the bacterial two-hybrid system above."

CaMKKβ activates Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IV, and the AMP-dependent protein kinase in a number of physiological pathways, including learning and memory formation, neuronal differentiation, and regulation of energy balance. Here, we report the novel regulation of CaMKKβ activity by multisite phosphorylation.

In addition to regulation of autonomous activity, we find that phosphorylation of CaMKKβ regulates its half-life. We find that cellular levels of CaMKKβ correlate with CDK5 activity and are regulated developmentally in neurons.

IntroductionThe Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases (CaMKKs) 2The abbreviations used are: CaMKKCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinaseAMPKAMP-dependent protein kinaseCaMcalmodulinCaMKCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseCGCcerebellar granule cellBDNFbrain-derived neurotrophic factorMEFmouse embryonic fibroblast. are serine/threonine-directed protein kinases that are activated following increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. There are two CaMKK isoforms, CaMKKα and CaMKKβ, that are encoded by two separate genes. The CaMKKs have similar domain structures consisting of N- and C-terminal domains of unknown function, a kinase domain, and an autoregulatory domain comprising overlapping autoinhibitory and calmodulin (CaM) binding regions (1Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+/CaM to the CaM binding domain releases autoinhibition allowing for maximal catalytic activity. Human CaMKKα and CaMKKβ share 65% protein sequence homology, with the highest degree of similarity in their kinase domains, and the biggest differences in the N- and C-terminal domains (2Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).The CaMKKs are well characterized activators of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases I (CaMKI) and IV (CaMKIV) (2Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this context, the CaMKKs are upstream activators of Ca2+/CaM-dependent signaling cascades. These cascades are activated following an elevation in intracellular Ca2+, which leads to Ca2+ binding to CaM. Upon Ca2+ binding, CaM assumes an active conformation that allows it to bind target proteins, including the CaMKKs and the CaMKs (5Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+/CaM to the CaMKs allows the activation loop of the kinase to assume a conformation in which it can then be phosphorylated by the CaMKKs (6Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, CaMKK/CaMK signaling cascades are regulated at multiple levels by Ca2+/CaM.CaMKKα and CaMKKβ are expressed most abundantly in the brain (2Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), where CaMKK/CaMK signaling cascades play important roles in a number of physiologically important neuronal processes, including learning and memory (8Mizuno K.

Davare M. Hoshi N. Nozaki N. Natsume T. Soderling T.R. Neuron. 2008; 57: 94-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, CaMKKβ, but not CaMKKα, is an upstream activator of the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) (15Hawley S.A. Pan D.A. Mustard K.J. Ross L. Bain J. Edelman A.M. Frenguelli B.G. Hardie D.G.

Chem. 2005; 280: 29060-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The regulation of AMPK by CaMKKβ is important for regulating energy balance in the hypothalamus (18Anderson K.A. Ribar T.J. Lin F. Noeldner P.K. Green M.F. Muehlbauer M.J. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Although both CaMKKs activate CaMKI and CaMKIV similarly, there are important differences in how the two are regulated. First, CaMKKα can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) leading to the recruitment of 14-3-3 and inactivation of the enzyme (19Davare M.A. Saneyoshi T. Guire E.S. Nygaard S.C. Soderling T.R. J.

FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although some PKA sites are conserved in both CaMKKs, the regulation of CaMKKβ by PKA has not been reported. In addition, although CaMKKα activity is almost exclusively dependent on Ca2+/CaM for activity, CaMKKβ has considerable autonomous activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM binding (2Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 21Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Despite high autonomous activity, CaMKKβ pathways involving substrates that are not themselves Ca2+/CaM-regulated, such as AMPK, still require a Ca2+/CaM signal for activation (17Hurley R.L. Anderson K.A. Franzone J.M. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29060-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In addition, CaMKKβ purified from bacterial and mammalian sources display varying amounts of autonomous activity (15Hawley S.A. Pan D.A. Mustard K.J. Ross L. Bain J. Edelman A.M. Frenguelli B.G. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 21Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These observations led us to believe that there are additional Ca2+/CaM-independent methods of CaMKKβ regulation.In this study, we describe the regulation of CaMKKβ by phosphorylation and identify cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as putative upstream kinases. Phosphorylation of CaMKKβ in vitro decreases the Ca2+/CaM-independent, autonomous activity of the enzyme. In addition, we find that CDK5/GSK3 phosphorylation regulates the turnover of CaMKKβ in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that appropriate phosphorylation of CaMKKβ is critical for its function in neurite development in primary neuronal cultures.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we report the novel regulation of CaMKKβ activity by multisite phosphorylation. We find that CaMKKβ autonomous activity is decreased following phosphorylation on three sites in the N terminus (Ser-129, Ser-133, and Ser-137), and we identify CDK5 and GSK3 as the kinases responsible for these phosphorylation events and show they act sequentially with CDK5 priming for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3. In addition, we find that CaMKKβ isolated from mammalian cells is constitutively phosphorylated, leading us to believe that this is a mechanism by which cells keep CaMKKβ autonomous activity low allowing for tight control of activity by Ca2+/CaM.In addition to regulation of autonomous activity, we find that phosphorylation of CaMKKβ by CDK5 and GSK3 regulates its half-life. From the results of pulse-chase experiments, we conclude that phosphorylation of Ser-129, Ser-133, and Ser-137 is critical for stability of newly synthesized protein. Because CaMKKβ needs to be phosphorylated by CDK5 before it can be phosphorylated by GSK3β, we predicted that regulation of CDK5 activity would correlate with CaMKKβ phosphorylation and stability. Our data from CDK5 conditional knock-out mice support this as the cortex and hippocampus from these animals have a significant decrease in CaMKKβ protein. In addition to CaMKKβ, the CDK5 substrate tyrosine hydroxylase is regulated in a similar fashion as phosphorylation also regulates its stability (39Moy L.Y. Tsai L.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54487-54493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, one important effect of CaMKKβ phosphorylation is to stabilize and thereby increase cellular levels of CaMKKβ.CDK5 activity is developmentally regulated and correlates with a switch from a proliferative state to a migratory state in neurons (36Tsai L.H. Takahashi T. Caviness Jr., V.S. Harlow E. Development. 1993; 119: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although CDK5 is ubiquitously expressed, its activity is regulated by co-expression of two small protein activators p35 and p39 (37Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 40Tang D. Yeung J. Lee K.Y. Matsushita M. Matsui H. Tomizawa K. Hatase O. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6758-6771Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in CDK5, p35, and p39 knock-out models demonstrate the importance of CDK5 activity in neuronal development, especially in the cortex (35Ohshima T. Ward J.M. Huh C.G. Longenecker G. Veeranna Pant H.C. Brady R.O. Martin L.J. Kulkarni A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 11173-11178Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar, 42Chae T. Kwon Y.T. Bronson R. Dikkes P. Li E. Tsai L.H. Neuron. 1997; 18: 29-42Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). In addition, CDK5 activity is important in the migration of granule cells in the developing cerebellum (43Ohshima T. Gilmore E.C. Longenecker G. Jacobowitz D.M. Brady R.O. Herrup K. Kulkarni A.B. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6017-6026Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous data from our laboratory demonstrated that the absence of CaMKKβ causes a defect in the developing cerebellum whereby granule cells fail to cease proliferation and migrate properly (10Kokubo M. Nishio M. Ribar T.J. Anderson K.A. West A.E. Means A.R. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 8901-8913Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). This led us to believe that induction of CDK5 activity during development would increase CaMKKβ levels allowing for its proper function in developing neurons. Our data from cultured CGCs support this theory. In CGCs, we reveal that CaMKKβ levels increase in concert with p35 levels as the cells differentiate in culture. Thus, CaMKKβ levels are regulated during development.We then questioned the role up-regulation of CaMKKβ may play during CGC development. When we examined CaMKKβ localization in CGC, we noticed it was enriched in growth cones. Enrichment of CDK5 and its activator p35 has also been reported in growth cones, and work in cultured cortical neurons demonstrated a requirement for CDK5 during neurite outgrowth (44Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T. Ramos Y.F. Tsai L.H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 816-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Previous work has demonstrated that a CaMKK/CaMKI pathway contributes to axon outgrowth through the regulation of growth cone motility (11Wayman G.A. Kaech S. Grant W.F. Davare M. Impey S. Tokumitsu H. Nozaki N. Banker G. Soderling T.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 3786-3794Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This led us to believe that phosporylation of CaMKKβ by CDK5 in the growth cone could be important in neurite outgrowth, so we examined neurite outgrowth in our CGC model. We found that CaMKKβ null CGCs grow shorter primary neurites than wild types, and we were able to rescue this defect with wild type CaMKKβ and CaMKKβ(S129A,S133A,S137A). This indicates that phosphorylation of CaMKKβ is not critical for its role in neurite extension. Surprisingly, CaMKKβ(S129D,S133D,S137D) was unable to recover the defect in primary neurite outgrowth and caused an additional defect in the establishment of appropriate neuronal polarity. This indicates CaMKKβ has an additional role in the early stages of neurite outgrowth during which appropriate axon-dendrite polarity is established from the polarized emergence of axons and dendrites (45Polleux F. Snider W. Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a001925Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This is consistent with previous work showing that constitutive activation of CaMKK/CaMKI pathways during the early stages of hippocampal neuron differentiation leads to the development of multiple axons (12Davare M.A. Fortin D.A. Saneyoshi T. Nygaard S. Kaech S. Banker G. Soderling T.R. Wayman G.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9794-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Thus, we conclude from our data that appropriate phosphorylation of CaMKKβ is most critical during the early stages of neurite outgrowth in which neuronal polarity is established.During the establishment of neuronal polarity, signaling molecules acquire a polarized distribution because of processes such as local protein translation and degradation in the emerging processes (45Polleux F. Snider W. Cold Spring Harbor Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a001925Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). One intriguing explanation for the phenotype generated by CaMKKβ(S129D,S133D,S137D) is that CaMKKβ is locally synthesized and phosphorylated in the neurite that will become the axon leading to its enhanced stability. Local synthesis of polarity proteins such as Par-3 is known to occur in axons and be essential for axon specification and growth (46Hengst U. Deglincerti A. Kim H.J. Jeon N.L. Jaffrey S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 1024-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition, the CaMKKβ downstream target cAMP-response element-binding protein is also known to be locally translated in axons where it is postulated to be more susceptible to modification before being transported to the nucleus where it influences transcription of target genes (47Cox L.J. Hengst U. Gurskaya N.G. Lukyanov K.A. Jaffrey S.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). If CaMKKβ was also locally modified by CDK5, in the case of CaMKKβ(S129D,S133D,S137D) this localized regulation would be lost and could lead to the inappropriate initiation and growth of the multiple nonpolarized neurites seen in our experiments. Additional work will be required to confirm this theory.There are several possible CaMKKβ downstream targets that could mediate its role in neurite outgrowth. In cortical neurons, CaMKK-CaMKIα and CaMKK-CaMKIγ pathways have been implicated in the growth of axons and dendrites, respectively (13Ageta-Ishihara N. Takemoto-Kimura S. Nonaka M. Adachi-Morishima A. Suzuki K. Kamijo S. Fujii H. Mano T. Blaeser F. Chatila T.A. Mizuno H. Hirano T. Tagawa Y. Okuno H. Bito H. J.

Suzuki S. Kojima M. Mishina M. Okuno H. Bito H. Neuron. 2007; 54: 755-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, regulation of CaMKIγ by CaMKK has also been implicated in the early stages of axon formation (12Davare M.A. Fortin D.A. Saneyoshi T. Nygaard S. Kaech S. Banker G. Soderling T.R. Wayman G.A. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 9794-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In cortical and hippocampal neurons, both CaMKKα and CaMKKβ are expressed, and it is not clear in these model systems which isoform is most important for CaMKI activation. Because CGCs express higher levels of CaMKKβ than CaMKKα (49Vinet J. Carra S. Blom J.M. Harvey M. Brunello N. Barden N. Tascedda F. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 111: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), it is reasonable to assume CaMKKβ may be the more important kinase isoform in this type of neuron.In addition to regulating CaMKI, CaMKKβ also regulates CaMKIV. Our previous work on the cerebellum of CaMKIV and CaMKKβ null animals implicates a CaMKKβ/CaMKIV/cAMP-response element-binding protein signaling pathway in the regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) transcription. BDNF is an important neurotrophin in CGC development influencing survival, migration, neurite outgrowth, and synapse development (50Jin X. Hu H. Mathers P.H. Agmon A. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5662-5673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Segal R.A. Pomeroy S.L. Stiles C.D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4970-4981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Hong E.J. McCord A.E. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 2008; 60: 610-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Recent work also demonstrates that the BDNF receptor TrkB adopts a polarized distribution in CGCs with the highest levels present in the leading process (53Zhou P. Porcionatto M. Pilapil M. Chen Y. Choi Y. Tolias K.F. Bikoff J.B. Hong E.J. Greenberg M.E. Segal R.A. Neuron. 2007; 55: 53-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This polarization is critical for migration of CGCs along BDNF gradients in the developing cerebellum. Because CaMKKβ regulates BDNF levels, disruption of this signaling pathway may adversely influence the establishment of BDNF gradients critical for appropriate CGC polarization and migration.Recent work has also implicated the CaMKKβ target AMPK in neuronal polarization and neurite growth (27Amato S. Liu X. Zheng B. Cantley L. Rakic P. Man H.Y. Science. 2011; 332: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In these studies, hippocampal neurons were treated with the AMPK agonists metformin or 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-riboside, and Amato et al. (27Amato S. Liu X. Zheng B. Cantley L. Rakic P. Man H.Y. Science. 2011; 332: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) noticed a failure to establish appropriate polarity as well as a decrease in total neurite length. This is similar to what we observe when we overexpress CaMKKβ(S129D,S133D,S137D). Further work is required to determine whether the phenotype we observe is due to increased activation of AMPK.Thus, we have described herein a novel CDK5/GSK3-dependent mechanism responsible for the regulation of CaMKKβ activity. In the future, it will be necessary to consider the phosphorylation status of CaMKKβ in addition to Ca2+/CaM binding to better understand regulation of CaMKKβ-dependent signaling pathways. IntroductionThe Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinases (CaMKKs) 2The abbreviations used are: CaMKKCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinaseAMPKAMP-dependent protein kinaseCaMcalmodulinCaMKCa2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinaseCGCcerebellar granule cellBDNFbrain-derived neurotrophic factorMEFmouse embryonic fibroblast. are serine/threonine-directed protein kinases that are activated following increases in intracellular Ca2+ concentration. There are two CaMKK isoforms, CaMKKα and CaMKKβ, that are encoded by two separate genes. The CaMKKs have similar domain structures consisting of N- and C-terminal domains of unknown function, a kinase domain, and an autoregulatory domain comprising overlapping autoinhibitory and calmodulin (CaM) binding regions (1Tokumitsu H. Wayman G.A. Muramatsu M. Soderling T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12823-12827Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+/CaM to the CaM binding domain releases autoinhibition allowing for maximal catalytic activity. Human CaMKKα and CaMKKβ share 65% protein sequence homology, with the highest degree of similarity in their kinase domains, and the biggest differences in the N- and C-terminal domains (2Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).The CaMKKs are well characterized activators of the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases I (CaMKI) and IV (CaMKIV) (2Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31880-31889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 3Lee J.C. Edelman A.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19320-19324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In this context, the CaMKKs are upstream activators of Ca2+/CaM-dependent signaling cascades. These cascades are activated following an elevation in intracellular Ca2+, which leads to Ca2+ binding to CaM. Upon Ca2+ binding, CaM assumes an active conformation that allows it to bind target proteins, including the CaMKKs and the CaMKs (5Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 4-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Binding of Ca2+/CaM to the CaMKs allows the activation loop of the kinase to assume a conformation in which it can then be phosphorylated by the CaMKKs (6Chatila T. Anderson K.A. Ho N. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21542-21548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 7Tokumitsu H. Soderling T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5617-5622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Thus, CaMKK/CaMK signaling cascades are regulated at multiple levels by Ca2+/CaM.CaMKKα and CaMKKβ are expressed most abundantly in the brain (2Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E.

Davare M. Hoshi N. Nozaki N. Natsume T. Soderling T.R. Neuron. 2008; 57: 94-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In addition, CaMKKβ, but not CaMKKα, is an upstream activator of the AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK) (15Hawley S.A. Pan D.A. Mustard K.J. Ross L. Bain J. Edelman A.M. Frenguelli B.G. Hardie D.G.

Chem. 2005; 280: 29060-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). The regulation of AMPK by CaMKKβ is important for regulating energy balance in the hypothalamus (18Anderson K.A. Ribar T.J. Lin F. Noeldner P.K. Green M.F. Muehlbauer M.J. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Cell Metab. 2008; 7: 377-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).Although both CaMKKs activate CaMKI and CaMKIV similarly, there are important differences in how the two are regulated. First, CaMKKα can be phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) leading to the recruitment of 14-3-3 and inactivation of the enzyme (19Davare M.A. Saneyoshi T. Guire E.S. Nygaard S.C. Soderling T.R. J.

FEBS Lett. 2008; 582: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although some PKA sites are conserved in both CaMKKs, the regulation of CaMKKβ by PKA has not been reported. In addition, although CaMKKα activity is almost exclusively dependent on Ca2+/CaM for activity, CaMKKβ has considerable autonomous activity in the absence of Ca2+/CaM binding (2Anderson K.A. Means R.L. Huang Q.H. Kemp B.E. Goldstein E.G. Selbert M.A. Edelman A.M. Fremeau R.T. Means A.R. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Despite high autonomous activity, CaMKKβ pathways involving substrates that are not themselves Ca2+/CaM-regulated, such as AMPK, still require a Ca2+/CaM signal for activation (17Hurley R.L. Anderson K.A. Franzone J.M. Kemp B.E. Means A.R. Witters L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 29060-29066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). In addition, CaMKKβ purified from bacterial and mammalian sources display varying amounts of autonomous activity (15Hawley S.A. Pan D.A. Mustard K.J. Ross L. Bain J. Edelman A.M. Frenguelli B.G. Hardie D.G. Cell Metab. 2005; 2: 9-19Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 21Tokumitsu H. Iwabu M. Ishikawa Y. Kobayashi R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13925-13932Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These observations led us to believe that there are additional Ca2+/CaM-independent methods of CaMKKβ regulation.In this study, we describe the regulation of CaMKKβ by phosphorylation and identify cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) as putative upstream kinases. Phosphorylation of CaMKKβ in vitro decreases the Ca2+/CaM-independent, autonomous activity of the enzyme. In addition, we find that CDK5/GSK3 phosphorylation regulates the turnover of CaMKKβ in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that appropriate phosphorylation of CaMKKβ is critical for its function in neurite development in primary neuronal cultures."

V-ATPases containing Vph1 and Stv1 localize predominantly to the vacuole and the Golgi apparatus/endosomes, respectively. Ratiometric measurements of vacuolar pH confirm that loss of STV1 has little effect on vacuolar pH. Loss of VPH1 results in vacuolar alkalinization that is even more rapid and pronounced than in vma mutants, which lack all V-ATPase activity. Cytosolic pH responses to glucose addition in the vph1Δ mutant are similar to those in vma mutants. The extended cytosolic acidification in these mutants arises from reduced activity of the plasma membrane proton pump, Pma1p. Pma1p is mislocalized in vma mutants but remains at the plasma membrane in both vph1Δ and stv1Δ mutants, suggesting multiple mechanisms for limiting Pma1 activity when organelle acidification is compromised. pH measurements in early prevacuolar compartments via a pHluorin fusion to the Golgi protein Gef1 demonstrate that pH responses of these compartments parallel cytosolic pH changes. Surprisingly, these compartments remain acidic even in the absence of V-ATPase function, possibly as a result of cytosolic acidification.

However, Smad2/3 direct target genes during those critical developmental stages have not been systematically identified. Here, through ChIP-chip assay, we show that the promoter/enhancer regions of 679 genes are bound by Smad2 in the zebrafish early gastrulas. Expression analyses confirm that a significant proportion of Smad2 targets are indeed subjected to Nodal/Smad2 regulation at the onset of gastrulation. The co-existence of DNA-binding sites of other transcription factors in the Smad2-bound regions allows the identification of well known Smad2-binding partners, such as FoxH1 and Lef1/β-catenin, as well as many previously unknown Smad2 partners, including Oct1 and Gata6, during embryogenesis. We demonstrate that Oct1 physically associates with and enhances the transcription and mesendodermal induction activity of Smad2, whereas Gata6 exerts an inhibitory role in Smad2 signaling and mesendodermal induction. Thus, our study systemically uncovers a large number of Smad2 targets in early gastrulas and suggests cooperative roles of Smad2 and other transcription factors in controlling target gene transcription, which will be valuable for studying regulatory cascades during germ layer formation and patterning of vertebrate embryos."

Chromatin plays a pivotal role in regulating gene expression by establishing heritable cell states. Unlike transcription factors that bind specific DNA sequences, many chromatin-associated transcription regulators bind to the histone proteins that package DNA into nucleosomes. Post-translational modification of the residues along the unfolded N-terminal histone tails is a dynamic mechanism that allows a single genetic locus to assume different transcriptional states. Enzymes catalyze the covalent attachment and removal of methyl, acetyl, and other molecular groups. Effector proteins specifically recognize these marks and establish gene silencing or activation by altering the accessibility of the locus to RNA polymerase and other transcription factors (1Kouzarides T.

Pc-TFs and deletion variants were cloned into pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) or ligated downstream of a CMV-TetO2 fragment (from pcDNA5/FRT/TO, Invitrogen) and cloned as EcoRI/PstI fragments into a pcDNA3.1(+)-based vector in which neomycin was replaced with puromycin resistance and the constitutive CMV promoter was deleted via SpeI digestion. HEK293 23;4;9 cells (16Hansen K.H. Bracken A.P. Pasini D. Dietrich N. Gehani S.S. Monrad A. Rappsilber J. Lerdrup M. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) were treated with 1 μg/ml dox expression for 2, 4, 6, or 8 days to induce Gal4-EED expression. 4-day dox-treated or untreated cells were plated at ∼1 × 105 cells/well in 24-well culture dishes, transfected with 200 ng of plasmid DNA, grown without dox for 48 h, and harvested for luciferase assays (Bright-Glo kit, Promega). A Scepter digital counter (Millipore) was used for cell counting. Transiently transfected HEK293 cells were imaged in 24-well plates at 200× using a Nikon fluorescence microscope (Model TE2000-E). U2OS cell lines were seeded at ∼5 × 104 cells/well on glass coverslips in 24-well culture dishes, treated with 1 μg/ml dox overnight, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde/1× PBS for 10 min, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100/1× PBS for 10 min. Slips were inverted into vinol mounting medium (P8136 polyvinyl alcohol, Sigma; 33% glycerol; 0.1% sodium azide in 1× PBS) on glass slides and imaged at 600×. Microscopy of live colonies was carried out on cells plated at low density (∼600 cells/cm2) in 6-well plates and grown in the presence or absence of 1 μg/ml dox for 5 days. Primary staining with rabbit anti-DsRed 632946 (Clontech) was followed by secondary staining with donkey anti-rabbit-HRP (Promega) and mouse anti-GAPDH-HRP conjugate G9295 (Sigma-Aldrich). SuperScript III (Invitrogen) was used to generate cDNA from 2 μg of total RNA isolated with either TRIzol (Invitrogen) or the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). See supplemental Table S1 for primers. Real-time quantitative PCR reactions (15 μl each) contained SYBR Green master mix (Applied Biosystems), 2.25 pmol of primers, and 2 μl of a 1:10 cDNA dilution (1:1000 dilution for GAPDH and mCh). “Relative mRNA level” was calculated as 2[Ct GAPDH − Ct experimental gene]. ∼1 × 108 cells were treated with 1 μg/ml dox for 5 days, collected by scraping, and incubated with 25 ml of 1% formaldehyde/1× Dulbecco's PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was quenched with 25 mm glycine for 5 min. Cross-linked cells were washed once with 1× PBS and twice in 175 μg/ml PMSF/1× PBS. Cell lysis and chromatin preps were carried out in buffers supplemented with 175 μg/ml PMSF and 12.5 mg/ml PLAAC protease inhibitor mixture. Cells were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in 10 ml of lysis buffer (62.5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6; 146 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 10.4% glycerol; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 0.26% Triton X-100), washed once in 8 ml of wash buffer (200 mm NaCl; 1 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm EGTA; 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0), and disrupted in 6 ml of sonication buffer (10 mm EDTA; 5 mm EGTA; 204 mm Tris, pH 8.0) using a Fisher Scientific Model 550 Sonic Dismembrator. Soluble chromatin was incubated with 5 mg/ml N-laurylsarcosine for 10 min and spun at ∼10,000 × g to remove impurities. DNA was purified from a chromatin sample by phenol/chloroform extraction and resolved via electrophoresis to confirm ∼500-bp fragments. For immunoprecipitations, each 6-ml sample was supplemented with 1.2% Triton X-100, 0.12% sodium deoxycholate, 0.8× TE, pH 7.5, PLAAC, and PMSF. U2OS Flp-in T-REx chromatin was incubated with rabbit anti-H3K27me3 07-449 (Millipore) or rabbit IgG (sc-2027, Santa Cruz Biotechnology.) overnight and protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h at 4 °C. Chromatin from Pc-TF- or TF-expressing cells was precipitated with mouse anti-Myc 3400 or mouse IgG 3420 bead conjugates (Cell Signaling Technology). Chromatin-antibody-bead complexes were washed essentially as described by Millipore (ChIP assay MCPROTO407). DNA-protein complexes were eluted in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS/TE. 100 μl of chromatin (input) was brought up to 500 μl with 1% SDS/TE. Samples were treated with Pronase for 1 h at 42 °C and then incubated at 65 °C for 48 h to reverse cross-linking. DNA was extracted twice with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), once with chloroform, supplemented with 15 μg of GlycoBlue (Ambion) and 200 mm NaCl, and EtOH-precipitated. DNA was resuspended in 0.5 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Real-time quantitative PCR reactions (15 μl each) contained SYBR Green master mix, 2 μl of immunoprecipitated (IP), mock-IP, or input template DNA, and 2.25 pmol of primers. % IP DNA bound was calculated as 100 × 2[Ct input − Ct IP]. % mock-IP bound (100 × 2[Ct input − Ct mock-IP] was subtracted from % IP DNA bound to calculate “% IP DNA enrichment relative to mock-IP.” Optimization of the senescence associated β-galactosidase (β-gal) detection assay for U2OS cells was carried out as follows. Cells were plated in 6-well dishes (∼5 × 105 cells/well), stressed with 0.1–0.4 μg/ml rotenone or DMSO for 96 h, stained with 0.015–15 μg/ml C12FDG at 37 °C for 1 h, and then harvested and resuspended in 0.5 ml of 1× Dulbecco's PBS for flow cytometry. Pc-TF cells were induced with 1 μg/ml dox for 96 h, and U2OS Flp-in T-REx cells were treated with 0.2 μg/ml rotenone, DMSO, or dox for 96 h, stained with 1.5 μg/ml C12FDG, and collected for flow cytometry. To determine whether Pc-TF recognizes methylated histones and reactivates a silenced locus, we used an inducible Polycomb silencing reporter system in HEK293 cells (16Hansen K.H. Bracken A.P. Pasini D. Dietrich N. Gehani S.S. Monrad A. Rappsilber J. Lerdrup M. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Polycomb chromatin formation at the GAL4TK-Luc transgene (luc) in HEK293 cells is mediated by Gal4-EED (silencer). dox treatment activates expression of the silencer, leading to luc repression and accumulation of H3K27me3 and Polycomb proteins at the promoter (16Hansen K.H. Bracken A.P. Pasini D. Dietrich N. Gehani S.S. Monrad A. Rappsilber J. Lerdrup M. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). Expression of a synthetic activator that consists of a Gal4 DNA-binding domain (Gal4DB), red fluorescent mCherry tag, VP64, and an SV40 nuclear localization signal leads to an ∼10-fold increase in luc expression over basal expression levels (supplemental Fig. S1A). Conversely, 4–8 days of dox-induced silencer expression lead to an ∼7-fold decrease of luc activity (supplemental Fig. S1B). Following luc silencing for 4 days, recruitment of VP64 directly upstream of the promoter leads to luc reactivation at levels ∼10-fold greater than initial basal expression levels (supplemental Fig. S1C). Deletion of the Gal4DB or the VP64 domain abolished luc reactivation, indicating that VP64 stimulates transcription when it is recruited near the promoter and that the Gal4DB alone is not sufficient to reactivate luc. The synthetic transcription activator was reengineered to recognize H3K27me3 by replacing the Gal4DB with a Polycomb chromodomain (PCD). hPCD-TF includes amino acids 1–62 from human CBX8, a peptide that preferentially binds H3K27me3 in vitro (17Bernstein E. Duncan E.M. Masui O. Gil J. Heard E. Allis C.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 2560-2569Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). We also built Pc-TFs using the chromodomains from a distant vertebrate (zebrafish) and flies (Drosophila) to investigate whether variations in amino acids around the conserved hydrophobic residues (Fig. 2A) might alter Pc-TF activity. fshPCD-TF includes amino acids 2–63 of zebrafish Pc1, a CBX homologue that acts during embryonic development (18Kawamura A. Yokota S. Yamada K. Inoue H. Inohaya K. Yamazaki K. Yasumasu I. Higashinakagawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). flyPCD-TF includes amino acids 16–77 of Drosophila Polycomb (Pc), a peptide that shows preferential H3K27me3 binding (19Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 20Min J. Zhang Y. Xu R.M. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1823-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) and confers Polycomb-like genomic localization when the peptide is tethered to a heterologous protein (19Fischle W. Wang Y. Jacobs S.A. Kim Y. Allis C.D. Khorasanizadeh S. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1870-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 21Platero J.S. Hartnett T. Eissenberg J.C. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3977-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Human Pc-TF-mediated reactivation of the Polycomb-silenced luc reporter relies upon a previously established silenced state. Mitotically stable luc silencing (16Hansen K.H. Bracken A.P. Pasini D. Dietrich N. Gehani S.S. Monrad A. Rappsilber J. Lerdrup M. Helin K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 1291-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar) was generated by transient expression of the repressor (4 days of dox treatment), followed by dox wash-out and growth in dox-free medium for 10 days. Cells expressing the human Pc-TF show a modest significant increase in luc expression as compared with the unsilenced reporter (Fig. 2C). Reactivation by human Pc-TF requires previous Gal4-EED expression and the PCD module, suggesting that Pc-TF is recruited to the reporter gene through a PCD-H3K27me3 interaction. We identified Pc-TF targets by looking for genes that were up-regulated upon Pc-TF expression. Transgene constructs were placed under the control of a dox-inducible CMV promoter (supplemental Fig. S2A) and integrated into a U2OS cell line that expresses a tetracycline repressor (Flp-in T-REx, referred to herein as the “parent line”). Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) (supplemental Fig. S2B) and Western blots (supplemental Fig. S2C) confirmed dox-inducible expression. The mCh tag showed clear nuclear localization in all cell lines (Fig. 3A). To identify Pc-TF target genes, total RNA from cells grown with or without dox for 96 h was used for NanoString quantitative RNA analysis of 500 development- and differentiation-associated genes (22Geiss G.K. Bumgarner R.E. Birditt B. Dahl T. Dowidar N. Dunaway D.L. Fell H.P. Ferree S. George R.D. Grogan T. James J.J. Maysuria M. Mitton J.D. Oliveri P. Osborn J.L. Peng T. Ratcliffe A.L. Webster P.J. Davidson E.H. Hood L. Dimitrov K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). We tested 14 positive hits by qRT-PCR of duplicate RNA samples (supplemental Fig. S3). CDKN2A (p16) senescence-associated gene, matrix metallopeptidase 12 (MMP12), natriuretic peptide (NPPA), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) were up-regulated by one or more of the Pc-TF cell lines in a VP64- and PCD-dependent manner. Cross-linked chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays showed enrichment of histone methylation near the promoters of CDKN2A, MMP12, and NPPA (Fig. 3C, supplemental Fig. S4), but not at TNF (data not shown), suggesting that the first three genes are direct targets of Pc-TF. hPCD-TF was significantly enriched (p < 0.01) near the p16 promoter (probe 3) as compared with a non-targeted protein in which the PCD was deleted. All three Pc-TF homologues showed significant enrichment near the MMP12 promoter (probe 6). Thus, the ChIP data are consistent with the qRT-PCR data for p16 and MMP12, indicating that these genes are direct targets of the Pc-TFs. We did not detect enrichment of Pc-TFs at promoters lacking H3K27me3 (TNF, ATOH1, ACTC1, and CASP10, data not shown), indicating that H3K27me3 is required for Pc-TF binding at endogenous loci. Interestingly, the H3K27me3-enriched promoters of NPPA and eomesodermin (EOMES), an additional gene included in our analysis (Fig. 3C, supplemental Fig. S4), show no Pc-TF enrichment, demonstrating that Pc-TF may preferentially bind a subset of H3K27me3 sites. Consistent with p16 activation, hPCD-TF-expressing cells showed senescence-associated phenotypes. Hallmarks of senescence include increased levels of β-gal activity and decreased cell proliferation (23Kuilman T. Michaloglou C. Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2463-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). Treatment with C12FDG followed by flow cytometry has been used to measure senescence-associated β-gal (SA-β-gal) in rotenone-stressed or aged senescent human fibroblasts (24Noppe G. Dekker P. de Koning-Treurniet C. Blom J. van Heemst D. Dirks R.W. Tanke H.J. Westendorp R.G. Maier A.B. Cytometry A. 2009; 75: 910-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). We optimized the assay for U2OS cells and found that 94 h of exposure to 0.2 μg/ml rotenone followed by staining with 1.5 μg/ml C12FDG was sufficient to detect an increase in SA-β-gal activity over background levels. We observed senescence-associated SA-β-gal activity in Pc-TF-expressing cells at levels comparable with cells stressed with rotenone. We repeated these results in two independent hPCD-TF-expressing cell lines and not in cells expressing VP64 or PCD deletion proteins or in parental cells (Fig. 4, A and B). To measure changes in cell proliferation, we plated cells at low density and observed growth of isolated colonies after 5 days of dox treatment. Colony size is diminished in hPCD-TF-expressing cells as compared with cells that do not express hPCD-TF (Fig. 4C). Our results demonstrate that the chromatin-targeted synthetic transcription activator induces a switch in cell state, from rapid proliferation to senescence, in the U2OS cancer cell line. Synthetic biology presents opportunities to deepen our understanding of molecular biology while creating useful new tools (25Haynes K.A. Silver P.A. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 187: 589-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Using the PCD to target a transcription activator to methylated histones has revealed some complexities underlying chromatin interaction. The H3K27me3-associated luc reporter (Fig. 2C) and CDKN2A are targeted by the human Pc-TF but not by the zebrafish or fly homologues. Perhaps the human PCD participates in human protein-specific interactions with other chromatin-associated proteins in addition to H3K27me3. Interestingly, MMP12 is targeted by all three Pc-TFs in a PCD-dependent manner. Thus, at least one locus has a chromatin structure that permits general PCD binding. Finally, our data indicate that not all H3K27me3-associated regions are bound by Pc-TF. hPCD-TF is enriched at the region immediately upstream of the CDKN2A promoter, but not at the other H3K27me3-enriched regions. Two H3K27me3-associated promoters (NPPA and EOMES) showed no Pc-TF enrichment, indicating that certain regions may be more accessible to Pc-TF binding than others. So far, we have confirmed p16 as a target of Pc-TF, which has implications for cancer therapy. Polycomb-mediated suppression of the senescence-associated p16 gene may augment cancer proliferation (23Kuilman T. Michaloglou C. Mooi W.J. Peeper D.S. Genes Dev. 2010; 24: 2463-2479Crossref PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar, 26Sparmann A. van Lohuizen M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 846-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Recently, drugs that broadly disrupt chromatin-mediated gene silencing in cancer cells have entered clinical trials (13Gravina G.L. Festuccia C. Marampon F. Popov V.M. Pestell R.G. Zani B.M. Tombolini V. Mol. Cancer. 2010; 9: 305Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) but lack specificity at the target gene level and may cause off-target effects. Pc-TFs integrate the information from epigenetic modifications with transcriptional regulation, providing a way to target therapeutic genes in a disease state-specific manner. Manipulating Polycomb-mediated gene regulation is also relevant for regenerative medicine. Human stem cells can be differentiated in vitro by depleting Polycomb factor levels and activating repressed genes (27Bracken A.P. Dietrich N. Pasini D. Hansen K.H. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1123-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Using Pc-TFs to reverse epigenetic silencing at these loci has the possible advantage of enabling reconfiguration of the modular domains to adjust the range of activated target genes. Thus far, we have shown that changing the PCD module influences target gene specificity in the case of p16 and MMP12 (Fig. 3, B and C). Changing the TATA motif-dependent VP64 module (14Beerli R.R. Segal D.J. Dreier B. Barbas 3rd, C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 14628-14633Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar) to a different activator, such as SP1 or p65 (28Emami K.H.

https://openalex.org/W2059976588,"The immunoglobulin (Ig) constant CH2 domain is critical for antibody effector functions. Isolated CH2 domains are promising scaffolds for construction of libraries containing diverse binders that could also confer some effector functions. We have shown previously that an isolated human CH2 domain is relatively unstable to thermally induced unfolding, but its stability can be improved by engineering an additional disulfide bond (Gong, R., Vu, B. K., Feng, Y., Prieto, D. A., Dyba, M. A., Walsh, J. D., Prabakaran, P., Veenstra, T. D., Tarasov, S. G., Ishima, R., and Dimitrov, D. S. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 14203-14210). We have hypothesized that the stability of this engineered antibody domain could be further increased by removing unstructured residues. To test our hypothesis, we removed the seven N-terminal residues that are in a random coil as suggested by our analysis of the isolated CH2 crystal structure and NMR data. The resulting shortened engineered CH2 (m01s) was highly soluble, monomeric, and remarkably stable, with a melting temperature (T(m)) of 82.6 °C, which is about 10 and 30 °C higher than those of the original stabilized CH2 (m01) and CH2, respectively. m01s and m01 were more resistant to protease digestion than CH2. A newly identified anti-CH2 antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope bound to m01s significantly better (>10-fold higher affinity) than to CH2 and slightly better than to m01. m01s bound to a recombinant soluble human neonatal Fc receptor at pH 6.0 more strongly than CH2. These data suggest that shortening the m01 N terminus significantly increases stability without disrupting its conformation and that our approach for increasing stability and decreasing size by removing unstructured regions may also apply to other proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2091778695,"We previously reported that partial disruption of the Ankrd26 gene in mice leads to hyperphagia and leptin-resistant obesity. To determine whether the Ankrd26 mutation can affect the development of adipocytes, we studied mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) from the mutant mice. We found that Ankrd26(-/-) MEFs have a higher rate of spontaneous adipogenesis than normal MEFs and that adipocyte formation is greatly increased when the cells are induced with troglitazone alone or with a mixture of troglitazone, insulin, dexamethasone, and methylisobutylxanthine. Increased adipogenesis was detected as an increase in lipid droplet formation and in the expression of several markers of adipogenesis. There was an increase in expression of early stage adipogenesis genes such as Krox20, KLF5, C/EBPβ, C/EBPδ, and late stage adipogenesis regulators KLF15, C/EBPα, PPARγ, and aP2. There was also an increase in adipocyte stem cell markers CD34 and Sca-1 and preadipocyte markers Gata2 and Pref-1, indicating an increase in both stem cells and progenitor cells in the mutant MEFs. Furthermore, ERK was found constitutively activated in Anrd26(-/-) MEFs, and the addition of MEK inhibitors to mutant cells blocked ERK activation, decreased adipogenesis induction, and significantly reduced expression of C/EBPδ, KLF15, PPARγ2, CD34, and Pref-1 genes. We conclude that Ankrd26 gene disruption promotes adipocyte differentiation at both the progenitor commitment and differentiation steps and that ERK activation plays a role in this process."
https://openalex.org/W2059257007,"The molecular mechanism of factor Xa (FXa) inhibition by Alboserpin, the major salivary gland anticoagulant from the mosquito and yellow fever vector Aedes albopictus, has been characterized. cDNA of Alboserpin predicts a 45-kDa protein that belongs to the serpin family of protease inhibitors. Recombinant Alboserpin displays stoichiometric, competitive, reversible and tight binding to FXa (picomolar range). Binding is highly specific and is not detectable for FX, catalytic site-blocked FXa, thrombin, and 12 other enzymes. Alboserpin displays high affinity binding to heparin (KD ∼ 20 nm), but no change in FXa inhibition was observed in the presence of the cofactor, implying that bridging mechanisms did not take place. Notably, Alboserpin was also found to interact with phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine but not with phosphatidylserine. Further, annexin V (in the absence of Ca2+) or heparin outcompetes Alboserpin for binding to phospholipid vesicles, suggesting a common binding site. Consistent with its activity, Alboserpin blocks prothrombinase activity and increases both prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time in vitro or ex vivo. Furthermore, Alboserpin prevents thrombus formation provoked by ferric chloride injury of the carotid artery and increases bleeding in a dose-dependent manner. Alboserpin emerges as an atypical serpin that targets FXa and displays unique phospholipid specificity.

Among anticoagulants, inhibitors targeting FVIIa/tissue factor, thrombin, FXa, FIXa, FXIIa, and high molecular weight kininogen have been reported (17Koh C.Y. Kini R.M. Thromb.

Blood. 2002; 99: 3602-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Of note, members of different protein families, including Kunitz-, ascaris-, and antistasin-like, and SALP have been identified as FXa inhibitors (17Koh C.Y. Kini R.M. Thromb. Haemost. 2009; 102: 437-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 21Francischetti I.M. Sa-Nunes A. Mans B.J. Santos I.M. Ribeiro J.M. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 2051-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Notably, the only serine protease inhibitor (serpin) described so far and found to target FXa was identified in the SG of the mosquito Aedes aegypti (22Stark K.R. James A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20802-20809Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar).

Serpins are a large and growing superfamily of structurally homologous yet functionally diverse proteins. Serpins have been identified in species of all kingdoms. These protease inhibitors act to control proteolytic activity in a myriad of contexts, including coagulation, fibrinolysis, and complement activation. They can also be found in the intracellular compartment and perform biologic functions that do not necessarily require their protease-inhibitory function. Approximately 500 serpins are currently known, consisting of between 350 and 400 amino acids with molecular weight ranging from 40 to 55 kDa (23Gettins P.G. Chem. Rev. 2002; 102: 4751-4804Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar, 24Rubin H. Nat. Med. 1996; 2: 632-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Medcalf R.L. FEBS J. 2005; 272: 4841Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe the main anticoagulant from Aedes albopictus SGs. We provide experimental evidence indicating that the molecule responsible for this salivary activity belongs to the serpin superfamily (hereafter named Alboserpin). We show that recombinant Alboserpin is a highly specific, tight inhibitor of FXa. Both recombinant Alboserpin and A. albopictus saliva do not bind to FX or DEGR-FXa (active site-blocked factor Xa containing the fluorescent inhibitor dansyl-Gly-Gly-Arg chloromethyl ketone dihydrochloride). Moreover, Alboserpin binds heparin; notably, it also interacts with phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) but not with phosphatidylserine (PS). In addition, it displays potent antithrombotic properties in vivo. Unless otherwise indicated, the protocols followed standard procedures (26Sambrook J. Fritish E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and all experiments were performed at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C). All water used was of 18 megaohm quality, produced by a MilliQ apparatus (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Heparin (4–6 kDa average) from porcine intestinal mucosa was purchased from Sigma. Egg l-α-PC and brain l-α-PS were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL). PE from bovine brain was purchased from Sigma. BLASTP analysis was performed with Alboserpin (gi:56417456) against the nonredundant data base, and all blood-feeding insect sequences were retrieved. Sequences were cleaned up to obtain a nonredundant set (proteins with >95% identity in the core domain were treated as identical) and aligned with ClustalX (27Jeanmougin F. Thompson J.D. Gouy M. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 403-405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar, 28Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Francischetti I.M. Valenzuela J.G. Schwan T.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Hammer C.H. Ribeiro J.M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2008; 38: 42-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Alignments were manually checked, adjusted, and trimmed to include the conserved serpin core. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using neighbor-joining analysis (29Kumar S. Tamura K. Nei M. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 189-191PubMed Google Scholar). Gapped positions were treated by pairwise deletion. Poisson correction was used as a substitution model to determine pairwise distances. Confidence was determined using bootstrap analysis (10,000 replicates) with 346 informative sites. The structure of Alboserpin was modeled using the automatic modeling mode in SWISS-MODEL (30Arnold K. Bordoli L. Kopp J. Schwede T. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (6071) Google Scholar). Alboserpin coordinates were loaded on PyMOL, and the electrostatic surface was calculated using the Adaptive Poisson Bolzmann Solver (APBS) tools. The template structure was the antithrombin-S195A factor Xa-pentasaccharide complex (Protein Data Bank code 2GD4). Secondary structure was obtained based on the Alboserpin model. Samples of saliva from female A. albopictus mosquitoes were collected by oil-induced salivation. After saliva collection, the sample was spun down at 14,000 × g in a bench top centrifuge, and the lower phase, containing the saliva, was transferred to a clean Eppendorf tube. SGs were dissected as indicated (31Francischetti I.M. Valenzuela J.G. Pham V.M. Garfield M.K. Ribeiro J.M. J. Exp. Biol. 2002; 205: 2429-2451Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration from the collected saliva and SG extracts was estimated spectrophotometrically in an ND1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE). For bacterial expression of recombinant Alboserpin, a synthetic gene was designed coding for the mature protein, which also contains NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. The synthetic Alboserpin gene was subcloned into pET-17b (Biobasic Inc., Markham, Canada) for expression in E. coli (BL21pLYS) cells. Recombinant protein production and inclusion body preparation were carried out as indicated (9Calvo E. Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The inclusion bodies were solubilized in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride, 15 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. The solubilized material was diluted in 4 liters of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm GSSG, 1 mm GSH, and 200 mm arginine monohydrochloride and incubated overnight. Refolded Alboserpin was concentrated and purified as indicated (9Calvo E. Mans B.J. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1935-1942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The purified recombinant protein was submitted to automated Edman degradation for N-terminal sequencing. Concentration of purified Alboserpin (corrected for ϵ280 nm = 44,410) (calculated using software from DNAStar Inc., Madison, WI) was estimated by its absorbance at 280 nm using a NanoDrop ND1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). Anticlotting measurements were performed either by measuring the recalcification time as described before (32Ribeiro J.M. Schneider M. Guimarães J.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 243-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) or by prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT). aPTT was carried out as supplied by the aPTT reagent kit (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, TX). Briefly, 30 μl of recombinant Alboserpin or SG extracts at different concentrations and 30 μl of normal reference plasma (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature before adding 30 μl of ALEXIN LS (diluted 1:3 in 20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4). After 5 min, clotting was induced with 30 μl of 20 mm CaCl2, 20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and measured at 650 nm every 11 s for 30 min. PT was measured under the same conditions described above, replacing ALEXIN reagent with Thromboplastin reagent (Helena Laboratories) diluted 1:2 in 20 mm HEPES, 120 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. All readings were performed in a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). All reactions were carried out at 37 °C. Five SG pairs from adult female mosquitoes (2–4 days old, non-blood-fed) were dissected under a stereoscopic microscope in 20 μl of PBS (0.02 m sodium phosphate, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) and kept at −80 °C until use. Factors X and Xa were obtained from Hematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction, VT), and chromogenic substrate N-benzoyl-l-isoleucyl-l-glutamyl-glycyl-l-arginine-p-nitroaniline hydrochloride (S2222) was purchased from DiaPharma Group Inc. (Westchester, OH). Recombinant Alboserpin at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 14.5 nm or SG extract (0.0023–0.3 μg/μl) was incubated with either 1, 3, or 6 nm FXa in 50 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.4, for 20 min at room temperature in a final volume of 100 μl. The reaction was initiated by adding 375 μm of S2222, and the FXa activity was measured spectrophotometrically at 405 nm for 1 h in a plate reader (Thermomax microplate reader, Molecular Devices). For the inhibition constant determination of Alboserpin for FXa, the SpectroFluor FXa fluorogenic substrate (American Diagnostica) was used. Briefly, 25 pm factor Xa was allowed to interact with increasing inhibitor concentrations (0–525 pm) in the presence of varying concentrations of substrate (100–500 μm), in 50 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4. Assays were performed in the 96-well plate format and were initiated by the addition of the enzyme to a mixture containing substrate and Alboserpin; reactions were followed for 30 min. Enzymatic activity was measured from the increase in absorbance of the free chromophore generated by substrate hydrolysis (λex = 360 nm, λem = 440 nm) using a SpectraMax Gemini XPS plate reader linked to SOFTmax Pro 3.0 software (Molecular Devices). For kinetics, the percentage inhibition of the reaction at different substrate concentrations was calculated from a control reaction containing only vehicle, and data were fitted using the Morrison equation (Equation 1) as reported (19Francischetti I.M. Valenzuela J.G. Ribeiro J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16678-16685Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), Vs/Vo={([Et]-[It]Ki*)+([It]+Ki*-[Et])2+4Ki*[Et]1/2}2[Et](Eq. 1) where Ki* is the apparent dissociation constant for the enzyme-inhibitor complex, Vs is the inhibited steady-state velocity, Vo is the control (uninhibited) velocity, [It] is the total inhibitor concentration, and [Et] is the total FXa concentration. Two μm FXa was incubated for 2 min in the absence or presence of Alboserpin (5 μm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2. The sample (0.5 ml) was applied at 0.5 ml/min on a 1-ml HiTrap heparin-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) column pre-equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with 8 ml followed by elution with a 30-ml gradient of 0–1.0 m NaCl prepared in the same buffer. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and their activity toward S2222 was determined as described above. Activation of prothrombin by human FXa was performed in TBS-Ca2+ (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.3% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.5), using a discontinuous assay. FXa (10 pm; final concentrations are given) was incubated with Alboserpin (0–500 pm) for 20 min at room temperature. Human FVa (1 nm) and PC/PS (10 μm) were added and incubated for 5 min. Reactions were initiated by the addition of human prothrombin (1.4 μm). Aliquots of 25 μl were removed every 1 min into microplate wells containing 50 μl of TBS-EDTA (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.5) to stop reactions. After the addition of 25 μl of S2238 (312.5 μm), absorbance at 405 nm was recorded at 37 °C for 15 min at 11-s intervals using a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices). Initial velocities (millioptical densities/min) obtained were used to calculate the amount of thrombin formed, using a standard curve (33Monteiro R.Q. Rezaie A.R. Ribeiro J.M. Francischetti I.M. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The absence of one of the components in the prothrombinase showed no thrombin formation. Binding of recombinant Alboserpin to FXa, FX, and DEGR-FXa was analyzed at 25 °C by SPR spectrometry using a BIAcore T100 instrument (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden) as described (34Calvo E. Tokumasu F. Mizurini D.M. McPhie P. Narum D.L. Ribeiro J.M. Monteiro R.Q. Francischetti I.M. FEBS J. 2010; 277: 413-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Factors X, Xa, and DEGR-Xa (30 μg/ml) were covalently immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip using the amine coupling kit supplied by BIAcore at a flow rate of 10 μl/min (aiming to reach 1500 resonance units (RU) in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.8), resulting in a final immobilization of 1470.8 RU for FXa, 1764.4 RU for FX, and 1807 RU for DEGR-FXa. Blank flow cells were used to subtract the buffer effect on the sensograms. For kinetic experiments, recombinant Alboserpin in concentrations ranging from 0.04 to 25 nm was run for 120 s at 30 μl/min in HBS-P buffer (10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% surfactant P20, pH 7.4). The Alboserpin-coagulation factor complex dissociation was monitored for 1800 s, and the active cell was regenerated with a 3-s pulse (50 μl/min) of 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 1.5. Kinetic experiments were performed in triplicate on different days. The same experimental design was utilized for kinetic analysis of bacterially expressed Alboserpin. BIAcore T100 evaluation software was used for kinetic evaluation, and sensograms were fitted using the 1:1 binding model (Langmuir binding model). Alternatively, an experiment was designed to test the presence of salivary Alboserpin in the mosquito's saliva. A new sensor chip was used so as to have the FX, Xa, and DEGR-FXa on the same sensor chip. The flow cell 1 was used as a blank to subtract the buffer effect on the sensograms. The immobilization procedure was the same as described above. Four different concentrations of A. albopictus saliva (15, 25, 50, and 90 μg/ml in HBS-P) were manually injected over the four flow cells in the sensor chip for 90 s at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. The complex dissociation was monitored for 500 s, and the sensor surface was regenerated by a pulse of 5 s of 10 mm glycine-HCl, pH 1.5, at 40 μl/min. These experiments were carried out in duplicate. Binding of recombinant Alboserpin to heparin was carried out by SPR using a BIAcore 3000 instrument. Heparin (4–6 kDa average molecular mass) was biotinylated at the reducing end and injected over an SA-sensor chip (GE Healthcare) in HBS-P (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% P20 surfactant) at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for 2 min. The resulting immobilization level obtained was 230.6 RU. The kinetics assay was performed at 25 °C in HBS-P. Alboserpin concentrations ranging from 3.9 to 62.25 nm were allowed to interact with immobilized heparin for 180 s at 30 μl/min. Alboserpin-heparin complex dissociations were monitored for 600 s, and the sensor was regenerated with a 1-min injection of 2.5 m NaCl at 30 μl/min. Kinetic parameters (kon, koff, and KD) were determined by global fitting of the sensograms using the 1:1 Langmuir binding model in the BIAcore Evaluation 3.1 software. Calorimetric assays for measuring FXa binding to Alboserpin were performed using a VPITC microcalorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA) at 30 °C. Titration experiments were performed by successive injections of 10 μl each of 17 μm FXa into the sample cell containing 2 μm Alboserpin. Prior to the run, the proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm CaCl2 for binding experiments. All solutions were degassed under vacuum for 5 min before use. The calorimetric enthalpy (ΔHcal) for each injection was calculated, and binding isotherms were fitted according to a model for a single binding site by nonlinear squares analysis using Microcal Origin software. The enthalpy change (ΔH), and stoichiometry (n) were determined according to Equation 2, Q=nθMt∆HVo(Eq. 2) where Q is the total heat content of the solution contained in the cell volume (Vo) at fractional saturation θ, ΔH is the molar heat of ligand binding, n is the number of sites, and Mt is the bulk concentration of macromolecule in Vo. The binding constant, Ka, is described as follows, Ka=θ/(1-θ)[X](Eq. 3) where [X] is the free concentration of ligand. Analysis of Alboserpin-FXa complex formation was carried out using a Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 column (3.2 × 300 mm; GE Healthcare), 2.4-ml bed volume, assembled in Akta Purifier equipment (Amersham Biosciences). The column optimal separation range is 300–70,000 Da, with an exclusion limit of 100,000 Da. The column was equilibrated in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at 40 μl/min. For the experiment runs, recombinant Alboserpin and FXa were loaded independently on the column. For the Alboserpin-FXa complex, equimolar concentrations of both proteins were incubated in HEPES-buffered saline, pH 7.4, at room temperature. After 30 min of incubation, the mixture was loaded on the column, and the protein-protein complex was monitored at 280 nm. Large unilamellar vesicles were formed by drying the lipids in a chloroform solution under a stream of nitrogen in a glass vial and then resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, vortexed, and extruded using a LiposoFast (Avestin Inc., Ottawa, Canada) extrusion device. Extrusion was performed through two (stacked) polycarbonated filters (19-mm diameter) of 0.1-μm pore size (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). The final concentration of the vesicle suspensions was 1 mg/ml, and nitrogen was bubbled through the mixture during preparation. Binding was measured at various salt concentrations by diluting the vesicle suspension in TBS containing the appropriate concentration of NaCl and 3 μm Alboserpin in a final volume of 50 μl. A second set of competition experiments was carried out where Alboserpin and phospholipids were incubated in the presence of 30 μg/ml heparin or 10 μm annexin V. The mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of 1× LDS loading buffer supplemented with 1× NuPAGE reducing agent. Both the pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the fraction of bound protein was determined by densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained gels using ImageJ software (public domain, open source; National Institutes of Health). Female C57BL/6 mice (6–10 weeks old) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). Mice were maintained at an American Association of Laboratory Animal Care-accredited facility at NIAID, National Institutes of Health. All experiments with mice were evaluated and approved by the NIAID Animal Care and Use Committee of the National Institutes of Health (Rockville, MD). For the tail vein bleeding assay, mice were injected intravenously with PBS or two doses of Alboserpin (10 and 100 μg/kg) in a 100-μl volume. After 30 min, mice were anesthetized and placed on a warming pad. A transverse incision was performed using a scalpel over a lateral vein at a position where the diameter of the tail is 2.5 mm. The tails were left hanging over the edge of the bench and immersed in a 12 × 75-mm tube containing 4 ml of saline buffer for 30 min. The tubes were gently rotated from time to time to prevent the shed blood from obscuring the incision. Although only mild bleeding was expected to occur in the assay, mice were observed for the next 6 h for signs of delayed bleeding. The samples were properly diluted, and the absorbance was determined at 540 nm to estimate hemoglobin content. Results represent the mean ± S.E. of three animals per group, and the assay was repeated twice. A second group of mice identically treated with Alboserpin or PBS was used for ex vivo aPTT and PT assays. Briefly, 1 h after Alboserpin or PBS administration, blood was collected by cardiac puncture in 3.8% trisodium citrate (9:1, v/v). Platelet-poor plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 15 min. aPTT and PT assays were carried out as described above. Mice were anesthetized with intramuscular xylazine (16 mg/kg) followed by ketamine (100 mg/kg). The right common carotid artery was isolated through a midline cervical incision, and the blood flow was continuously monitored using a 0.5VB Doppler flow probe coupled to a TS420 flow meter (Transonic Systems, Ithaca, NY) as described previously (35Wang X. Xu L. Thromb. Res. 2005; 115: 95-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Alboserpin (at 50, 100, or 200 μg/kg) or vehicle was infused into the tail vein 15 min before injury. Thrombus formation was induced by applying a piece of filter paper (1 × 2 mm) saturated with 7.5% FeCl3 solution to the adventitial surface of the artery for 3 min. After exposure, the filter paper was removed, and the vessel was washed with sterile normal saline. Carotid blood flow was continuously monitored for 60 min or until complete occlusion (0 flow for at least 10 s) occurred. All assays were performed at 30 °C in triplicate. Protein (300 nm) was preincubated, with each enzyme tested for 10 min before the addition of the corresponding substrate as described (36Kotsyfakis M. Karim S. Andersen J.F. Mather T.N. Ribeiro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 29256-29263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Statistical differences among the groups were analyzed by analysis of variance using Tukey as a multiple comparison post-test. A p value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant. The sialotranscriptome of female A. albopictus SG (37Arcà B. Lombardo F. Francischetti I.M. Pham V.M. Mestres-Simon M. Andersen J.F. Ribeiro J.M. Insect Biochem. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2000977010,"The altered sensory experience of profound early onset deafness provokes sometimes large scale neural reorganisations. In particular, auditory-visual cross-modal plasticity occurs, wherein redundant auditory cortex becomes recruited to vision. However, the effect of human deafness on neural structures involved in visual processing prior to the visual cortex has never been investigated, either in humans or animals. We investigated neural changes at the retina and optic nerve head in profoundly deaf (N = 14) and hearing (N = 15) adults using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), an in-vivo light interference method of quantifying retinal micro-structure. We compared retinal changes with behavioural results from the same deaf and hearing adults, measuring sensitivity in the peripheral visual field using Goldmann perimetry. Deaf adults had significantly larger neural rim areas, within the optic nerve head in comparison to hearing controls suggesting greater retinal ganglion cell number. Deaf adults also demonstrated significantly larger visual field areas (indicating greater peripheral sensitivity) than controls. Furthermore, neural rim area was significantly correlated with visual field area in both deaf and hearing adults. Deaf adults also showed a significantly different pattern of retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) distribution compared to controls. Significant correlations between the depth of the RNFL at the inferior-nasal peripapillary retina and the corresponding far temporal and superior temporal visual field areas (sensitivity) were found. Our results show that cross-modal plasticity after early onset deafness may not be limited to the sensory cortices, noting specific retinal adaptations in early onset deaf adults which are significantly correlated with peripheral vision sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2018967828,"BCL-2 modifying factor (BMF) is a sentinel considered to register damage at the cytoskeleton and to convey a death signal to B-cell lymphoma 2. B-cell lymphoma 2 is neutralized by BMF and thereby facilitates cytochrome C release from mitochondria. We investigated the role of BMF for intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) homeostasis. Acute colitis was induced in Bmf-deficient mice (Bmf(-/-)) with dextran sulfate sodium. Colonic crypt length in Bmf(-/-) mice was significantly increased as compared with WT mice. Dextran sulfate sodium induced less signs of colitis in Bmf(-/-) mice, as weight loss was reduced compared with the WT. Primary human IEC exhibited increased BMF in the extrusion zone. Quantitative PCR showed a significant up-regulation of BMF expression after initiation of anoikis in primary human IEC. BMF was found on mitochondria during anoikis, as demonstrated by Western blot analysis. RNAi mediated knockdown of BMF reduced the number of apoptotic cells and led to reduced caspase 3 activity. A significant increase in phospho-AKT was determined after RNAi treatment. BMF knockdown supports survival of IEC.

To date, no ligands, endogenously or synthetic, have been identified that modulate EBI2 activity. Here we describe an inverse agonist, GSK682753A, which selectively inhibited the constitutive activity of EBI2 with high potency and efficacy. In cAMP-response element-binding protein-based reporter and guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) binding assays, the potency of this compound was 2.6–53.6 nm, and its inhibitory efficacy was 75%. In addition, we show that EBI2 constitutively activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) in a pertussis toxin-insensitive manner. Intriguingly, GSK682753A inhibited ERK phosphorylation, GTPγS binding, and cAMP-response element-binding protein activation with similar potency. Overexpression of EBI2 profoundly potentiated antibody-stimulated ex vivo proliferation of murine B cells compared with WT cells, whereas this was equivalently reduced for EBI2-deficient B cells. Inhibition of EBI2 constitutive activity suppressed the proliferation in all cases. Importantly, the suppression was of much higher potency (32-fold) in WT or EBI2-overexpressing B cells compared with EBI2-deficient counterparts. Finally, we screened GSK682753A against an EBI2 mutant library to determine putative molecular binding determinants in EBI2. We identified Phe111 at position III:08/3.32 as being crucial for GSK682753A inverse agonism because Ala substitution resulted in a >500-fold decrease in IC50. In conclusion, we present the first ligand targeting EBI2. In turn, this molecule provides a useful tool for further characterization of EBI2 as well as serving as a potent lead compound.

https://openalex.org/W2089160846,"Development and homeostasis require stringent spatiotemporal control of gene expression patterns that are established, to a large extent, by combinatorial action of transcription regulatory proteins. The bZIP transcription factor NRL (neural retina leucine zipper) is critical for rod versus cone photoreceptor cell fate choice during retinal development and acts as a molecular switch to produce rods from postmitotic precursors. Loss of Nrl in mouse leads to a cone-only retina, whereas ectopic expression of Nrl in photoreceptor precursors generates rods. To decipher the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms upstream of Nrl, we identified putative cis-control elements in the Nrl promoter/enhancer region by examining cross-species sequence conservation. Using in vivo transfection of promoter-reporter constructs into the mouse retina, we show that a 0.9-kb sequence upstream of the Nrl transcription initiation site is sufficient to drive reporter gene expression in photoreceptors. We further define a 0.3-kb sequence including a proximal promoter (cluster A1) and an enhancer (cluster B) that can direct rod-specific expression in vivo. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using mouse retinal nuclear extracts, in combination with specific antibodies, demonstrate the binding of retinoid-related orphan nuclear receptor β (RORβ), cone rod homeobox, orthodenticle homolog 2, and cyclic AMP response element-binding protein to predicted consensus elements within clusters A and B. Our studies demonstrate Nrl as a direct transcriptional target of RORβ and suggest that combinatorial action of multiple regulatory factors modulates the expression of Nrl in developing and mature retina."
https://openalex.org/W2135114922,"Excessive production or accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides in human brains leads to increased amyloid deposition and cognitive dysfunction, which are invariable pathological features in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many cellular factors can regulate the production of Aβ. In this study, we show that a family of proteins named Nogo receptor proteins (NgR1 to NgR3) regulates Aβ production via interaction with amyloid precursor protein (APP). Further mapping of the interacting domain indicates that a small region adjacent to the BACE1 cleavage site of APP mediates interaction of APP with Nogo receptor proteins. Our results also indicate that increased interaction between Nogo receptor and APP reduces surface expression of APP and favors processing of APP by BACE1. When NgR2 was ablated in AD transgenic mice expressing Swedish APP and PS1ΔE9, amyloid deposition was clearly reduced (0.66% of total measured area in APP(swe)/PS1ΔE9/NgR2(-/-) mice vs. 0.76% of total measured area in APP(swe)/PS1ΔE9 mice). Our results demonstrate that down-regulation of NgR expression is a potential approach for inhibiting amyloid deposition in AD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2022751822,"Leucine zippers are oligomerization domains used in a wide range of proteins. Their structure is based on a highly conserved heptad repeat sequence in which two key positions are occupied by leucines. The leucine zipper of the cell cycle-regulated Nek2 kinase is important for its dimerization and activation. However, the sequence of this leucine zipper is most unusual in that leucines occupy only one of the two hydrophobic positions. The other position, depending on the register of the heptad repeat, is occupied by either acidic or basic residues. Using NMR spectroscopy, we show that this leucine zipper exists in two conformations of almost equal population that exchange with a rate of 17 s−1. We propose that the two conformations correspond to the two possible registers of the heptad repeat. This hypothesis is supported by a cysteine mutant that locks the protein in one of the two conformations. NMR spectra of this mutant showed the predicted 2-fold reduction of peaks in the 15N HSQC spectrum and the complete removal of cross peaks in exchange spectra. It is possible that interconversion of these two conformations may be triggered by external signals in a manner similar to that proposed recently for the microtubule binding domain of dynein and the HAMP domain.

As a result, the leucine zipper of Nek2 kinase is the first example where the frameshift of coiled-coil heptad repeats has been directly observed experimentally. Intracellular signaling pathways that regulate processes such as cell cycle control rely on formation of specific protein complexes at the right time and place. As a result, a wide range of conserved interaction motifs have evolved among which the leucine zipper is one of the most common and versatile. Leucine zippers were first identified as dimerization domains in bZIP transcription factors with a sequence motif consisting of leucines repeated every 7 amino acids (1Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2513) Google Scholar). The relevance of the repeating heptad sequence was clarified when it was shown that leucine zippers assume a coiled-coil fold (2Oas T.G. McIntosh L.P. O'Shea E.K. Dahlquist F.W. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2891-2894Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 3Saudek V. Pastore A. Castiglione M.A. Frank R. Gausepohl H. Gibson T. Weih F. Roesch P.

In this structure, the first and fourth residues (i.e. positions A and D in the heptad sequence, ABCDEFG) of each helix point toward each other and thus form a hydrophobic core. Residues in positions E and G flank the hydrophobic core residues and are often occupied by charged residues that can form salt bridges. The latter are of particular significance in heterodimeric leucine zippers as they help to determine specificity. Residues in positions B, C, and F are usually not of importance as their side-chains point away from the coiled-coil interface. Leucine zippers show great versatility as they can exist as dimers, trimers, or tetramers, can be homo- or hetero-oligomers and can form parallel or anti-parallel complexes (5Alber T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 6Adamson J.G. Zhou N.E. Hodges R.S. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1993; 4: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Mason J.M. Arndt K.M. ChemBioChem. 2005; 5: 170-176Crossref Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Although leucine zippers have been best characterized in transcription factors, they also exist in many other signaling proteins including protein kinases (8Mukai H. Ono Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 897-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Protein kinase activation often involves a trans-autophosphorylation step that is facilitated by the physical proximity of two kinase molecules. In the case of receptor tyrosine kinases, this may be brought about by crosslinking of two receptors as a result of extracellular ligand binding. Some cytoplasmic kinases on the other hand contain their own oligomerization domain. One example is the cell cycle-regulated kinase, Nek2, which consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain and a C-terminal region that contains multiple regulatory motifs, including a leucine zipper (9Fry A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6184-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). For this kinase, oligomerization via the leucine zipper is essential for full activation both in vitro and in vivo, most likely as a result of it promoting trans-autophosphorylation (10Fry A.M. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16304-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11Rellos P. Ivins F.J. Baxter J.E. Pike A. Nott T.J. Parkinson D.M. Das S.

In a previous study on the role of the Nek2 leucine zipper, we noted that the sequence, in terms of the distribution of hydrophobic and charged residues, is somewhat unusual (10Fry A.M. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16304-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). However, no structural studies were undertaken at the time. Here, we now show that the Nek2 leucine zipper does indeed display highly atypical biophysical properties with NMR spectroscopy clearly showing that the leucine zipper exists in two conformations, which exchange on a relatively slow timescale. This raises the intriguing possibility that the dimerization and, as a result, activation of the Nek2 kinase may be subject to specific regulation. It is also the first time that the exchange of a coiled-coil domain, indirectly inferred for several completely unrelated proteins, has been directly observed experimentally. Domain definitions for Nek2 kinase were taken from annotations of entry P51955 from the Uniprot database with small modifications for Fig. 1A. Leucine zipper prediction was performed with the 2ZIP server (12Bornberg-Bauer E. Rivals E. Vingron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2740-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The coiled-coil prediction was performed with the COILS server (13Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar).

SDS-PAGE analysis was performed following a 1:500 trypsin:target (w/w) incubation at 25 °C. Aliquots were withdrawn at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 60 min. The reaction for each time point was immediately halted by the addition of Pefabloc SC (2 mm final) and PSC protector solution (5% v/v final) from Roche. Sequencing grade modified trypsin was obtained from Promega. To identify the protected fragments, a 60-min limited digest was performed, as above, and the products separated by reverse-phase chromatography using a JASCO HPLC and a 4.5 ml Zorbex stable bond 300 C3 column at 1 ml/min heated to 55 °C. The column was developed with 5–50% acetonitrile, 0.05% TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) pH 1.8 at 1% acetonitrile/min. Peaks were collected in 0.5-ml fractions and monitored at 280, 220, and 210 nm wavelengths. The fractions were analyzed by standard electrospray MS procedures. Protein molecular weight was determined using a stand-alone syringe pump (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA) coupled to a Platform electrospray mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Samples were desalted on-line using a 2 × 10 mm guard column (Upchurch Scientific, Oak Harbor, WA) packed with 50 micron Poros RII resin (Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham) inserted in place of the sample loop on a rheodyne 7125 valve. Proteins were injected onto the column in 10% acetonitrile, 0.10% formic acid, washed with the same solvent and then step-eluted into the mass spectrometer in 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid at a flow rate of 10 μl/min. The mass spectrometer was calibrated using myoglobin. Standard samples comprised of 100 pmol of protein at a minimum concentration of 1 μm. All protein expression constructs were cloned into pETM-11 vectors obtained from the Protein Expression Laboratory at EMBL Heidelberg. Inserts were generated by polymerase chain reaction using 2.5 units of Platinum® Pfx DNA Polymerase (Roche) with 200 ng of template, 500 nm of each primer, 1.2 mm dNTP mix, and 1 mm MgSO4 on a Techne TC-312 thermocycler. Amplification was done by initial denaturation for 2′ at 94 °C followed by 30 cycles of 15″ melting at 94 °C, 60″ at 60 °C and 30″ extension at 68 °C. Primers for constructs LZ0 and LZ5 were LZ05′: GGAGCGCCCATGGCGCGACAATTAGGAGAG; LZ03′: GGATCCTTATAGCAAGCTGTAGTTCTTCACAGATTTTCTGC; LZ55′: GCGCCCATGGCGGTATTGAGTGAGCTGAAACTG; LZ53′: GGATCCTTAGTCCTCTGCTAGTCTCTCACG, respectively. PCR products were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit according to the manufacturer's protocol. Purified PCR products and pETM-11 target vector DNA were double digested with NcoI and BamHI. The product of the vector digestion was purified by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel (analytical quality, Melford Labs). DNA was extracted from excised bands using the QIAquick gel extraction kit. 50 ng of gel purified digestion product from the vector and 150 ng of digested PCR product were mixed and ligated using the rapid DNA ligation kit (Roche). 1/10 of the ligation reaction was transformed into 100 μl DH5a-T1R chemical competent cells (Invitrogen). Transformed cells were checked for inserts by colony PCR. Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) using the manufacturer's protocol. Mutagenesis primers were C335A: CAGAAAGAACAGGAGCTTGCAGTTCGTGAGAGACTAG and GTCTCTCACGAACTGCAAGCTCCTGTTCTTTCTG; K309C: CTGTATTGAGTGAGCTGAAACTGTGTGAAATTCAGTTACAGGAGCGAGA and TCTCGCTCCTGTAACTGAATTTCACACAGTTTCAGCTCACTCAATACAG; E310C: ATTGAGTGAGCTGAAACTGAAGTGTATTCAGTTACAGGAGCGAGAGC and GCTCTCGCTCCTGTAACTGAATACACTTCAGTTTCAGCTCACTCAAT (mutated codon indicated in bold). For all constructs and mutants, small scale cultures were grown for several positive clones, and DNA was prepared with the Qiagen miniprep kit. Accuracy of vector and insert was checked by DNA sequencing. For protein expression, miniprep DNA was transformed into BL21* cells (Invitrogen). Transformed cells were grown up in LB medium to OD ∼0.8 when they were induced with 0.75 mm IPTG for 4 h. For 15N isotope labeling the protocol was modified as suggested (18Marley J. Lu M. Bracken C. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 71-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Cells were opened using a French Press cell at 1000 psi. The proteins were purified on fast flow 6 (GE Healthcare) columns of 2 ml resin, equilibrated as per the manufacturer's instructions. After loading the samples, the columns were washed with 30 ml of wash buffer (20 mm phosphate pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm β-ME, 0.02% NaN3) before elution with 10 ml of elution buffer (as wash buffer, but with 500 mm imidazole). The eluted protein was incubated with AcTEV protease (Invitrogen) for 2 h at room temperature followed by dialysis 3× against 1 liter of fast flow 6 wash buffer. The protein solution was applied a second time to the affinity column to remove nonspecific binding proteins. Where required, a final polishing step using a Sephadex 16/70 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare) was performed using an AKTA purification system. Fractions containing the pure protein were pooled and concentrated in Vivaspin concentrators (Sartorius) with 3 kDa molecular mass cut-off. Protein concentrations were determined using the Qbit fluorescence assay (Invitrogen). Protein samples were exchanged into NMR buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0, 2 mm DTT, 0.02% NaN3) using PD10 or Nap5 columns (GE Healthcare), which were also used for all other experiments. The only exceptions were samples of disulfide locked LZ5 K309C/C335A, LZ5 E310C/C335A, and LZ0 K309C/C335A for which DTT was omitted from the buffer. CD spectroscopy. All CD experiments were recorded on a JASCO700 instrument fitted with a Peltier temperature control system. Square cuvettes with 0.1 or 1 mm path length were used with protein concentrations ranging from 20–200 μm. Spectra were calibrated using software provided by the manufacturer. Secondary structure content was estimated using home written Mathematica (Wolfram Research) macros by comparison to standard curves for α-helix, β-sheet, and random coil. To measure thermal unfolding curves, samples were heated at 1 °C/min while the CD signal at a constant wavelength of 222 nm was measured. Unfolding curves were fitted to the equation for a two-state unfolding reaction using a home written Mathematica macro to extract the melting temperature.

The HSQC spectrum was used as provided by the manufacturer with small modifications to increase safety of the probe. Exchange experiments were as previously described (22Farrow N.A. Zhang O.

For qualitative analysis exchange experiments with a mixing time of 64 ms were used, for the quantitative analysis of the exchange rate the following mixing times were used: 8, 16, 24, 32, 64, 96, and 160 ms. Diagonal and cross peak intensities for sufficiently well resolved systems of exchanging amide resonances were extracted using CCPN analysis (23Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A.

Sequence-specific assignment of mutant LZ5 K309C/C335A in non-reducing NMR buffer was based on standard triple resonance three-dimensional experiments (HNCACB, HN(CO)CACB, HBHA(CBCACO)NH) recorded on a 0.6 mm 15N/13C labeled sample on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe combined with a 3D 15N resolved NOESY spectrum recorded on a 0.8 mm 15N labeled sample on a 700 MHz Bruker Avance spectrometer equipped with a cryoprobe. The assignment was performed with CCPN analysis (23Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D.

RDCs were measured in the presence of 10 mg/ml of pf1 phage (Hyglos GmbH, Germany) in NMR buffer using a standard IPAP 1H-15N correlation experiment (24Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn.

A coiled-coil model was generated for the Nek2 leucine zipper residues 299–341 using a program provided by G. Offer (25Offer G. Sessions R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 967-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This program generates standard coiled-coils based on the definition of the geometry provided as input. No further energy minimization was performed. Parameters used were pitch = 144 Å, helix radius = 4.7 Å, relative rotation of strands = 210°, residue translation for one residue in the helix = 1.495 Å. The same sequence was used as input for models for both heptad repeats. The only difference was the definition of the first A- residue: Leu-306 in HepI and Leu-303 in HepII. RDCs were calculated for the models using PALES (26Zweckstetter M. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 679-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) selecting pf1 phage as alignment medium at a concentration of 10 mg/ml, electrostatic mode, a sodium chloride concentration of 50 mm and default settings for all other parameters. The Nek2A kinase consists of an N-terminal catalytic domain (residues 8–271) followed by a C-terminal regulatory region (residues 272–445) that encompasses a leucine zipper (residues 305–335) followed immediately by an additional short coiled-coil (residues 340–355) (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the C-terminal region is subdivided into a particular domain organization, limited proteolysis experiments were performed on full-length protein (Fig. 1B) and the complete C-terminal regulatory region (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. S1) to identify stable fragments. A ∼8 kDa fragment appeared consistently in both experiments. It was shown by mass spectrometry to cover not only the leucine zipper but all of the following coiled-coil and a short section of the linker connecting it at the N-terminal end to the catalytic domain (residues 290–360). This 8 kDa fragment was subcloned into the pETM-11 expression vector and termed LZ0. For comparison, a series of constructs was generated covering only the predicted core leucine zipper. The best behaved of these, based on a number of criteria including expression yield in bacteria, solubility and stability, was termed LZ5 (residues 299–343). For all biophysical experiments, LZ0 and LZ5 proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified using nickel affinity chromatography followed by removal of the His tag and polished via gel filtration (data not shown). Meaningful leucine zipper scores provided by the program 2zip (12Bornberg-Bauer E. Rivals E. Vingron M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2740-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) start around residue 305 and continue to approximately residue 335 (Fig. 2A). Coiled-coil scores provided by the COILS software (13Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3441) Google Scholar) cover the leucine zipper, drop to insignificant levels around residue 335, and then return to a significant level from residue 340–355. The leucine zipper is defined by the presence of leucine residues every 7 amino acids. However, in the conventional heptad repeat of a leucine zipper, a second position is also occupied by another leucine or equally compatible hydrophobic residue such that, in the repeating heptad ABCDEFG, positions A and D would normally both be occupied by hydrophobic residues. In Nek2, though, one of these hydrophobic positions is missing, such that the heptad pattern can be positioned in two ways: the leucines can be in the A-position (heptad I) or in the d-position (heptad II). It is traditionally thought that leucine prefers the d-position, but the energetic contribution to coiled-coil stability and the frequency by which leucine is found in either position in leucine zipper sequences are very similar (27Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Regardless of the positions of the heptad repeats in Nek2, charged residues would occupy the second conserved position. In heptad I, it would be lysine or arginine in the D position, while in heptad II, it would be glutamate in the A position. Curiously, lysine and arginine in general prefer the A position while glutamate prefers the D position (27Tripet B. Wagschal K. Lavigne P. Mant C.T. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 377-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 28Straussman R. Ben-Ya'acov A. Woolfson D.N. Ravid S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1232-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Even though charged residues have been found in the hydrophobic core of other coiled-coils, e.g. myosin, they compromise the stability and make the Nek2 leucine zipper a non-ideal coiled-coil. It is interesting to note the consistent occupation of the normally hydrophobic A and D positions by charged residues in the leucine zipper of Nek2. Of the 6 A positions in heptad II, 5 are occupied by glutamate (the first is occupied by a leucine), while in the case of heptad I, lysine and arginine each take 3 of the 6 D positions (Fig. 2). The high degree of conservation of these destabilizing residues suggests an important function. To determine whether other proteins contain related leucine zippers which might allow hetero-oligomerization, similarity searches were performed with a pattern search program (15Bucher P. Karplus K. Moeri N. Hofmann K. Comput. Chem. 1996; 20: 3-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) using the pattern LXXR/KEXX repeated five times. No coiled-coil sequences other than that of Nek2 were found in this search, even allowing for up to two mismatches. Hence, the primary function of this motif in Nek2 would appear to be to promote homodimerization rather than heterodimerization with a different partner molecule. As a first biophysical approach to understand their conformation, CD spectroscopy was performed on the LZ0 and LZ5 polypeptides. The spectra were virtually identical and typical of coiled-coils with minima at 208 and 222 nm and the intensity of the 208 nm peak slightly stronger than the 222 nm peak (Fig. 3A). The molar ellipticities at 222 nm of approximately −22,000 deg mol−1 cm−2 suggested the presence of ∼70% α-helix, in good agreement with expectation. Melting curves showed reasonably cooperative thermal unfolding with relatively high melting temperatures of 57 °C for LZ5 and a slightly higher value of 66 °C for LZ0 (Fig. 3B). These data show that the core leucine zipper sequence alone is sufficient to assume a proper fold and that the additional coiled-coil only adds extra stability. To determine whether the bacterially expressed LZ0 and LZ5 proteins were dimeric as opposed to higher order oligomers, they were subjected to sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Results strongly supported the conclusion that LZ0 and the LZ5 proteins predominantly formed dimeric molecules that were stable over the relevant concentration range (tested over 10–250 μm). As an example, the sedimentation velocity analysis is shown for LZ0 (Fig. 4A) with the main peak indicating a molecular weight within 500 Da of the calculated molecular mass of the dimer at 17,468 Da. All parameters are listed in Table 1. Although the peaks are not perfectly symmetrical, it can be concluded that the leucine zipper of the Nek2 kinase, with or without the extra coiled-coil portion, forms a dimer as the predominant species. Under the conditions of these experiments there was no sign of higher order oligomers.TABLE 1Sedimentation velocity results for the leucine zipper constructs employed in this studyConstructSappS20,wF/F0Monomer MWApparent MWSSkDakDaLZ0, 228 μm0.861.401.78.717.0LZ0, 29 μm0.891.401.78.717.7LZ51.101.111.55.410.7LZ5 C335A/K309C reduced1.071.081.55.410.0LZ5 C335A/K309C oxidized1.051.061.65.410.1 Open table in a new tab Early NMR studies of constructs of the Nek2 leucine zipper showed unusual “twins” of resonances in homonuclear NOESY and TOCSY spectra suggesting the presence of multiple forms of the protein (data not shown). A more detailed analysis of potential isoforms was therefore performed using a 15N-labeled sample of LZ5. In an HSQC experiment, automatic peak picking with CCPN analysis (23Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2215) Google Scholar) gave >75 peaks, significantly more than the expected ∼40 peaks, confirming the presence of at least two forms of the protein (Fig. 5A). Very similar spectra were obtained for LZ0, although as the quality of the spectra was much inferior (Fig. 3) all subsequent NMR work was done on LZ5. To establish if the isoforms were in dynamic equilibrium, two NMR exchange experiments were recorded (22Farrow N.A. Zhang O. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 727-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) via transfer to 15N. The resulting two-dimensional spectrum can then take the shape of an HSQC experiment by frequency labeling the nitrogen in t1 (Fig. 5B), or the appearance of a NOESY experiment with frequency labeling of the amide proton in t1 (Fig. 5C). Both experiments clearly demonstrated that a substantial number of resonances in the Nek2 leucine zipper undergo slow exchange on the chemical shift time scale (Fig. 5, B and C). To further improve the identification of exchange cross peaks, both versions of the exchange experiment were combined into a three-dimensional version that"

In B cells, this differential response is associated with similar levels of IL-27 receptor chains, IL-27Rα and gp130, in both subsets and stronger STAT1 and STAT3 activation by IL-27 in naive B cells. Here, we show that the stronger proliferative response of CD3-stimulated naive CD4(+) T cells to IL-27 is associated with lower levels of IL-27Rα but higher levels of gp130 compared with memory CD4(+) T cells. IL-27 signaling differs between naive and memory CD4(+) T cells, as shown by more sustained STAT1, -3, and -5 activation and weaker activation of SHP-2 in naive CD4(+) T cells. In the latter, IL-27 increases G0/G1 to S phase transition, cell division and, in some cases, cell survival. IL-27 proliferative effect on naive CD4(+) T cells is independent of MAPK, but is dependent on c-Myc and Pim-1 induction by IL-27 and is associated with induction of cyclin D2, cyclin D3, and CDK4 by IL-27 in a c-Myc and Pim-1-dependent manner. In BCR-stimulated naive B cells, IL-27 only increases entry in the S phase and induces the expression of Pim-1 and of cyclins A, D2, and D3. In these cells, inhibition of Pim-1 inhibits IL-27 effect on proliferation and cyclin induction. Altogether, these data indicate that IL-27 mediates proliferation of naive CD4(+) T cells and B cells through induction of both common and distinct sets of cell cycle regulators."

Control of viral replication is essential to reduce the size of latent reservoirs, mainly during primary infection when HIV-1 infects CD4+ T cells massively. The addition of immunosuppressive agents to highly active antiretroviral therapy during primary infection would suppress HIV-1 replication by limiting T cell activation, but these agents show potential risk for causing lymphoproliferative disorders. Selective inhibition of PKCθ, crucial for T cell function, would limit T cell activation and HIV-1 replication without causing general immunosuppression due to PKCθ being mostly expressed in T cells. Accordingly, the effect of rottlerin, a dose-dependent PKCθ inhibitor, on HIV-1 replication was analyzed in T cells. Rottlerin was able to reduce HIV-1 replication more than 20-fold in MT-2 (IC50 = 5.2 μm) and Jurkat (IC50 = 2.2 μm) cells and more than 4-fold in peripheral blood lymphocytes (IC50 = 4.4 μm). Selective inhibition of PKCθ, but not PKCδ or -ζ, was observed at <6.0 μm, decreasing the phosphorylation at residue Thr538 on the kinase catalytic domain activation loop and avoiding PKCθ translocation to the lipid rafts. Consequently, the main effector at the end of PKCθ pathway, NF-κB, was repressed. Rottlerin also caused a significant inhibition of HIV-1 integration. Recently, several specific PKCθ inhibitors have been designed for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Using these inhibitors in combination with highly active antiretroviral therapy during primary infection could be helpful to avoid massive viral infection and replication from infected CD4+ T cells, reducing the reservoir size at early stages of the infection.

The novel protein serine/threonine kinase C θ (PKCθ) isoform is selectively expressed in T lymphocytes but not B lymphocytes, erythrocytes, polymorphonuclear neutrophils, monocytes, or macrophages (1Meller N. Altman A. Isakov N. Stem Cells. 1998; 16: 178-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Other PKC isotypes (α, β, δ, ∈, ζ, and η) are also expressed in T cells, but PKCθ is essential for T cell receptor/CD3-mediated activation events (2Baier G. Telford D. Giampa L. Coggeshall K.M.

Immunol. 2002; 20: 761-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Among novel PKCs, PKCθ displays the highest amino acid similarity with PKCδ, not only in the catalytic or kinase core and the diacylglycerol binding regulatory domain C1 but mainly in the NH2-terminal V1 domain (2Baier G. Telford D. Giampa L. Coggeshall K.M. Baier-Bitterlich G. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4997-5004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, V3 domain of PKCθ is unique and does not show significant similarity with any other PKC isoforms, including PKCδ. As a result, PKCθ provides a molecular basis for isotype selectivity and the non-redundant activity of distinct PKC isoenzymes in T cells (4Altman A. Isakov N. Baier G. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 567-573Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). PKCθ kinase activity is regulated by phosphorylation of the activation-loop residue Thr538 on the catalytic domain during T cell activation (5Baier G. Immunol. Rev. 2003; 192: 64-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Residue Thr538 has been described as critical for PKCθ catalytic activity for regulating phosphorylation of the hydrophobic motif and for enabling CD3-mediated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation (6Liu Y. Graham C. Li A. Fisher R.J. Shaw S. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). PKCθ also shows the unique property of being translocated to the plasma membrane lipid rafts during the immunological synapse between T cells and antigen-presenting cells (7Newton A.C. J.

Recruitment of PKCθ to the immunological synapse induces the activation of intracellular signaling pathways as the mitogen-activated protein kinase and the NF-κB pathway (10Coudronniere N. Villalba M. Englund N. Altman A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 3394-3399PubMed Google Scholar), essential for the regulation of T cell growth-promoting genes as IL-2 (interleukin-2) (3Isakov N. Altman A. Annu. Rev.

NF-κB is also critical for the replication of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) in human blood CD4+ T cells (12Alcamí J. Laín de Lera T. Folgueira L. Pedraza M.A. Jacqué J.M.

The main NF-κB inhibitor, IκBα, binds to the NF-κB nuclear localization signal to keep it inactive in the cytoplasm in the absence of activation. Upon T cell activation, IκBα is phosphorylated by the IκB kinase complex and degraded in the proteasome (13Chen Z. Hagler J. Palombella V.J. Melandri F. Scherer D. Ballard D. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1586-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar), releasing the nuclear localization signal and allowing NF-κB translocation to the nucleus, where binds to cognate sequences in inducible gene promoters (14May M.J.

The main target for HIV-1 infection is the CD4+ T cell population, in particular memory CD4+ T cells that are generated by antigen recognition (15Chomont N. El-Far M. Ancuta P. Trautmann L.

On the other hand, the opposite strategy may also be considered to reduce the size of latent reservoirs from the beginning of the infection.

Sequences used to generate pGeneClip-iPKCθ-1 vector were iPKCt1-s (5′-TCTCGATTGGCTTGTCCAACTTTAAGTTCTCTAAAGTTGGACAAGCCAATCCT-3′) and iPKCt1-as (5′-CTGCAGGATTGGCTTGTCCAACTTTAGAGAACTTAAAGTTGGACAAGCCAATC-3′).Sequences used to generate pGeneClip-iPKCθ-3 vector were iPKCt3-s (5′-TCTCGTAGAGAAGAGAGTTCTTTAAGTTCTCTAAAGAACTCTCTTCTCTACCT-3′) and iPKCt3-as (5′-CTGCAGGTAGAGAAGAGAGTTCTTTAGAGAACTTAAAGAACTCTCTTCTCTAC-3′). Scrambled sequences used to generate pGeneClip-iPKCθ-C1 vector were iPKCtC1-s (3′-TCTCGGTTGCTTCCTGTATTAACAAGTTCTCTGTTAATACAGGAAGCAACCCT-5′) and iPKCtC1-as (3′-CTGCAGGGTTGCTTCCTGTATTAACAGAGAACTTGTTAATACAGGAAGCAACC-5′). Each pair of primers was annealed and cloned in linearized pGeneClip vector according to the manufacturers' instructions. pRL-TK Renilla or pSV-β-galactosidase vector, used as controls of transfection efficiency, were purchased from Promega. Plasmids were purified using Qiagen Plasmid Maxi kit (Qiagen Iberia, Madrid, Spain) following the manufacturer's instructions. Rottlerin or mallotoxin is a cell-permeable inhibitor of PKCθ (IC50 ≥ 1.25 μm) (33Springael C. Thomas S. Rahmouni S. Vandamme A. Goldman M. Willems F. Vosters O. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2007; 73: 515-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and PKCδ (IC5 0 ≥ 6.0 μm) that was purchased from Calbiochem. Rottlerin also inhibits PKCα, -β, -γ, -∈, -η, and -ξ isoenzymes at high concentration (>30 μm). Bisindolylmaleimide I (Gö6850) is a highly selective cell-permeable inhibitor of PKCα, -βI, -βII, -γ, -δ, and -∈ isoenzymes (Ki = 10 nm), structurally similar to staurosporine, supplied by Merck Chemicals (34Gekeler V.

Bisindolylmaleimide was used at 1.0 μm to ensure efficient inhibition of PKCδ without inhibition of protein kinase A (Ki = 2.0 μm) (35Villalba M. Neuroreport. 1998; 9: 1713-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). PHA was used at 5 μg/ml, and 5-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) was used at 25 ng/ml. Purified anti-human CD3 (clone OKT3) and CD28 (clone CD28.2) were used for T cell activation (eBiosciences, San Diego, CA). Polyclonal antibody against human PKCθ (clone C-18) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Polyclonal antibodies against phospho-PKCθ (Thr538), phospho-PKCδ (Thr505), and phospho-PKCζ/λ (Thr410/403) were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Antibodies against p65/RelA (clone C-20), IκBα (clone C-21), phospho-IκBα (Ser32) (clone 14D4), and full-length native HIV-1 p24 antigen (clone 491) were supplied by Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Specific antibody against the β-isoform of actin was obtained from Sigma. Secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase were purchased from GE Healthcare. Antibodies against CD4 and the chemokine (CXC motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4) conjugated with phycoerythrin were purchased from BD Biosciences. PKCθ and PKCδ enzymatic activity was assayed using an immunoprecipitation kinase assay described previously (36Zhang D. Anantharam V. Kanthasamy A. Kanthasamy A.G. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2007; 322: 913-922Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, Jurkat cells were incubated with rottlerin or bisindolylmaleimide for 18 h and then collected and washed once with 1× PBS. The pellet was resuspended in PKC lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm NaF, and 4 μg/ml each of aprotonin and leupeptin). The lysates were incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were collected as cytosolic fractions, and protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Cytosolic extracts (250–500 μg) were immunoprecipitated for 18 h at 4 °C using 2 μg of anti-PKCθ or anti-PKCδ antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were then incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG (whole molecule) antibody conjugated with agarose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C while gently rotating. The agarose-bound antigen-antibody complexes were washed three times with 2× kinase buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 μm ATP, and 2.5 mm CaCl2) and resuspended in 20 μl of 2× kinase buffer. The enzymatic reaction was started by adding 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 3 μg of PKC∈ peptide substrate ERMRPRKRQGSVRRRV, 50 μg/ml phosphatidylserine, 4.1 μm diacylglycerol, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 3000 Ci/mm to the immunoprecipitated samples, which were subsequently incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The enzymatic reaction was stopped by spotting 20 μl of the reaction mixture onto an individually precut strip of phosphocellulose P81 paper (Millipore Iberica, Madrid, Spain). After air drying, the P81 strips were sequentially washed 3 times for 10 min each in 1% phosphoric acid solution (Sigma) with constant gentle stirring. A radioactive control was set up to measure the total [γ-32P]ATP counts introduced into the reaction by spotting 5 μl of the [γ-32P]ATP reaction buffer on a P81 strip. The control was dried for 2 min, and counts were read without previous washing. As a negative control, one reaction with the goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated with agarose (Sigma) was performed without adding the primary antibody to the cytosolic extracts. A complete reaction mixture lacking of PKC∈ peptide substrate was used as the blank solution. Radioactivity on each air-dried P81 paper was counted in a Beckman LS 6000L scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). The corrected cpm was determined by subtracting the blank control value. Stable transfection of Jurkat and MT2 cells with pGeneClip-iPKCθ-C1 or with pGeneClip-iPKCθ-1 and pGeneClip-iPKCθ-3 vectors was performed by electroporation with an Easyjet Plus Electroporator (Equibio, Middlesex, UK). In brief, 5 × 106 cells were collected in 250 μl of RPMI without supplement and mixed with 5 μg of plasmid DNA in an electroporation cuvette with a 2-mm electrode gap (Equibio). Cells were transfected by two pulses at 280 V, 150 microfarads, and 330 ohms. After transfection, cells were incubated in supplemental RPMI at 37 °C for 18 h, and then puromycin was added to the culture medium at 0.5 μg/ml/day until selection. For transient transfections, 5–10 × 106 cells were resuspended in 350 μl of RPMI without supplements and mixed with 5–10 μg of plasmid DNA in an electroporation cuvette with a 4-mm electrode gap (Equibio). Jurkat cells were transfected by one pulse at 280 V and 1500 microfarads, and resting PBLs were transfected by 1 pulse at 320 V and 1500 microfarads. After transfection, cells were incubated in supplemental RPMI for 18 h at 37 °C. Luciferase and Renilla activities were assayed with the Luciferase Assay System (Promega), and β-galactosidase activity was measured with the β-Galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. Relative luciferase and Renilla units (RLUs) were measured in supernatants with a Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Oak Ridge, TN) after the addition of the appropriate substrate; β-galactosidase activity was measured at 420 nm in a microplate reader Sunrise (Tecan Group Ltd., Männedorf, Switzerland). RLUs were normalized by measuring both β-galactosidase activity and total protein concentration by the method of Bradford (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar) using a bovine serum albumin standard curve. Infectious supernatants were obtained from calcium phosphate transfection of 293T cells with plasmids pNL4.3-wt or pNL4.3-Renilla. VSV-pseudotyped ΔEnv-NL4.3-Luc virus was obtained by co-transfection of full-length HIV-1 DNA not expressing the HIV envelope (pNL4.3-Luc-R_E_) (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent program, NIAID, National Institutes of Health) and pcDNA-VSV, which expresses G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus (38He J.

Classic antiviral assays were performed by pretreating PBLs activated with anti-CD3/CD28 or PHA/IL-2 for 3 days or MT-2 cells with different concentrations of rottlerin for 30 min and infecting for 2 additional hours with HIV-1 NL4.3-wt strain or recombinant HIV-1 NL4.3-Renilla with gentle rotation at room temperature. Cells were then centrifuged at 600 × g for 30 min at 25 °C. After extensive washing with 1× PBS, rottlerin was added again and left in culture for 2–7 days. Supernatants were collected, and HIV-1 p24 antigen was measured by immunoblotting or using an enzyme-like immunoassay (InnotestTM HIV Ag mAb; Innogenetics, Barcelona, Spain). Cells were lysed for quantifying Renilla or luciferase activity as described above. Inhibitory concentrations 50 (IC50) were determined by incubating PBLs activated with anti-CD3/CD28 or PHA/IL-2 for 3 days or MT-2 cells in a 96-well microtiter plate in the presence of 0.5 ng of p24/well of recombinant HIV-1 NL4.3-Renilla as well as increasing concentrations of rottlerin. Production of Renilla (RLUs), corresponding to HIV-1 replication, was measured 48 h post-infection. IC50 was calculated using GraphPad Prism Software (sigmoidal dose-response formula). Cell viability was evaluated in cells treated in parallel as described below. Half-maximal cytotoxic concentrations 50 (CC50) were calculated using GraphPad Prism Software (sigmoidal dose-response formula). Cell viability was determined with the CellTiter-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability assay (Promega) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 1× PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer. After incubation for 10 min at room temperature to stabilize luminescent signal, cell lysates were deposited in an opaque-walled multiwell plate and analyzed in an Orion Microplate Luminometer with Simplicity software (Berthold Detection Systems, Oak Ridge, TN). Cell viability was also determined by observing the cells in bright-field with Leica DMI 4000B Inverted Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Barcelona, Spain) or by staining with propidium iodide and analysis in a FACScalibur Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences) using CellQuest software. Cell proliferation was measured with the CellTiter-96 Aqueous Non-radioactive Cell Proliferation assay (Promega) according to the manufacture's instructions. Briefly, 2 × 104 cells per well were cultured in a 96-well microtiter plate in the absence of any stimulus or with 5 μg/ml PHA for 72 h. Compound 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium was mixed with phenazine methosulfate solution and then added to the culture medium. Absorbance was measured at 490 nm after incubation for 3 h. The proliferation rate for each cell type in response to PHA was compared with their proliferation rate in the absence of stimulus. Cytosolic, nuclear, and membrane protein fractions were obtained as described previously (40Laín de Lera T. Folgueira L. Martín A.G. Dargemont C. Pedraza M.A. Bermejo M. Bonay P. Fresno M. Alcami J.

Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (37Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214455) Google Scholar). Eighty micrograms of protein extracts from each fraction were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose paper (GE Healthcare). After blocking and incubation with primary and secondary antibodies, proteins were detected with SuperSignal West Pico/Femto Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce). Images were acquired in a Bio-Rad Geldoc 2000. The DNA affinity immunoblotting assay was performed as described previously (6Liu Y. Graham C. Li A. Fisher R.J. Shaw S. Biochem.

Briefly, 100 μg of nuclear protein extracts from Jurkat cells were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 25 nm concentrations of a 5′-labeled biotin probe that contains the double κB consensus motif located in the HIV-1 LTR promoter (5′-AGCTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGA-3′) or with a probe that contains the estrogen receptor DNA element, a non-related NF-κB gene (43Klein-Hitpass L.

Situs inversus totalis, in which there is complete right to left reversal of the thoracic and abdominal organs, occurs once in about 8,000 persons. Although situs inversus is usually of no medical consequence, heterotaxia, incomplete reversal of organs, occurs with higher frequency and causes significant medical problems. These problems are observed not only in humans but also in nearly all vertebrates in whom LR asymmetry needs to be established during development. In zebrafish, LR asymmetric signals are first established around KV, a ciliated organ that generates directional fluid flow (1Essner J.J. Vogan K.J. Wagner M.K. Tabin C.J. Yost H.J. Brueckner M.

Ciliogenesis, key to the initiation of LR asymmetry, is dependent on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (4Neugebauer J.M. Amack J.D. Peterson A.G. Bisgrove B.W. Yost H.J. Nature. 2009; 458: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Hong S.K. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Then, LR asymmetry is conveyed and stabilized in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), patterning left and right sides of the embryo (6Raya A. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A critical event of LR patterning at this stage is the left-sided expression of nodal/southpaw (spaw) in the LPM (7Levin M. Johnson R.L. Stern C.D. Kuehn M. Tabin C. Cell. 1995; 82: 803-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 8Collignon J. Varlet I. Robertson E.J.

The left-sided Nodal/Spaw then activates lefty1 in the ventral neural tube, lefty2 and pitx2 in the LPM, all exclusively on the left side (12Meno C. Ito Y. Saijoh Y. Matsuda Y. Tashiro K. Kuhara S.

Lefty1 and Lefty2 antagonize Nodal activity, thus generating a negative feedback loop to restrict the extent and duration of Nodal signaling. The left-sided expression of nodal/spaw, lefty2, and pitx2 are highly conserved in vertebrates to ensure proper LR patterning (6Raya A. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).Retinoic acid (RA) and bone morphogenetic protein signals have been reported to regulate several aspects of LR asymmetry. Treatment of RA antagonist leads to randomization of heart looping and perturbed sideness of nodal in mouse (16Chazaud C. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 1999; 126: 2589-2596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but roles of RA signaling in the determination of heart and visceral laterality in zebrafish remain unknown. In Xenopus, chick, and mouse, bone morphogenetic protein signaling is required to repress Nodal activity in the right LPM, thus ensuring right-sided laterality (17Ramsdell A.F. Yost H.J.

Biol. 2000; 219: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, bone morphogenetic protein signaling regulates LR asymmetry at two distinct developmental time points. Shortly after KV has been formed during early segmentation, bone morphogenetic protein signaling is necessary to repress spaw in the right LPM, similar to other vertebrates (21Chocron S. Verhoeven M.C. Rentzsch F. Hammerschmidt M. Bakkers J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In later segmentation at around the 22-somite (22So) stage prior to the initiation of cardiac jogging, bmp4 is asymmetrically distributed in the cardiac field with stronger expression on the left side (22Chen J.N. van Eeden F.J. Warren K.S. Chin A. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Haffter P. Fishman M.C. Development. 1997; 124: 4373-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This asymmetric bmp4 is required for the determination of heart laterality (21Chocron S. Verhoeven M.C. Rentzsch F. Hammerschmidt M. Bakkers J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Chen J.N. van Eeden F.J. Warren K.S. Chin A. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Haffter P. Fishman M.C.

Cell. 2008; 14: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Ectopic expression of bmp4 on the right side results in reversal of heart laterality, but visceral organs are unaffected (24Schilling T.F. Concordet J.P. Ingham P.W. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Induction of exogenous noggin3 at the 16-somite stage causes perturbation of heart laterality, but visceral laterality remains normal (21Chocron S. Verhoeven M.C. Rentzsch F. Hammerschmidt M. Bakkers J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). High occurrence of heterotaxia in nature proposes that asymmetries of heart and visceral organs may involve different regulatory mechanisms and need to be coordinated. However, key mechanistic differences and concordance between visceral and heart laterality during LR patterning remain to be elucidated.Here we demonstrate that inhibition of RA signaling before 2So leads to randomized laterality of visceral organs through bilateral expression of spaw, which resulted from increases in cilia length and defective directional fluid flow in KV. Fgf8 is required to mediate the control of cilia length by RA signaling. Inhibition of RA signaling before 2So also results in mild defects of heart laterality, which become much more severe through disturbance of cardiac bmp4 asymmetry when RA signaling is blocked after 2So. However, visceral laterality and left-sided spaw and lefty2 remain unaffected at this stage. Our study first identifies RA signaling as the key signaling pathway that sequentially controls visceral and heart laterality, so that RA signaling achieves their concordance during LR patterning.DISCUSSIONIn summary, our results suggest that RA signaling regulates LR patterning of organs at two stages in zebrafish. Before 2So, RA signaling is critical for setting up the left-sided Nodal signal through regulation of cilia length and KV fluid flow. fgf8 is required to mediate this regulation. The left-sided Nodal signal is the key dictator of visceral laterality so that RA signaling controls visceral laterality before 2So. Roles of RA signaling in the determination of heart laterality are mild before 2So, and become much more significant after 2So through regulation of cardiac bmp4 asymmetry. Although previous studies have reported that visceral and heart laterality is sometimes uncoordinated so that their asymmetries may need concordance (21Chocron S. Verhoeven M.C. Rentzsch F. Hammerschmidt M. Bakkers J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 24Schilling T.F. Concordet J.P. Ingham P.W. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), our study first identifies RA signaling as the key signaling pathway that sequentially controls and coordinates visceral and heart laterality.Titrations for the cut-off time at the shield, 80%E, bud, 2So, and 4So have identified the significance of 2So (data not shown). Theoretically, on one hand, formation of KV and cilia are initially observed at 3–4So (2Essner J.J. Amack J.D. Nyholm M.K. Harris E.B. Yost H.J. Development. 2005; 132: 1247-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Thus, RA signaling should be functional to regulate ciliogenesis before that. This point was proven by the unaffected sideness of spaw and lefty2 after RA treatment at 4So (Fig. 3, E and K). On the other hand, asymmetric expression of raldh2 in the anterior LPM initiates at 1–2So (Fig. 7H). Therefore, control of cardiac bmp4 asymmetry by RA signaling is enabled only after that. These two aspects fit our titration results and supply possible explanations why 2So becomes a critical cut-off time.Discrepancy between treatments of RA antagonist and raldh2 mutation have been previously reported in mice and discussed in two papers published by the same laboratory (16Chazaud C. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 1999; 126: 2589-2596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Niederreither K. Vermot J. Messaddeq N. Schuhbaur B. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 2001; 128: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the papers showed disturbed sideness of nodal and lefty in mouse embryos treated with RA antagonist (16Chazaud C. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 1999; 126: 2589-2596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the second exhibited unaffected sideness of nodal and pitx2 in raldh2−/− mouse mutant (44Niederreither K. Vermot J. Messaddeq N. Schuhbaur B. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 2001; 128: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This discrepancy could also exist in zebrafish (45Kawakami Y. Raya A. Raya R.M. Rodríguez-Esteban C. Belmonte J.C. Nature. 2005; 435: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), and be explained by the following four possible reasons. First, other RA synthesis enzymes like Raldh1, Raldh3, and Raldh4 play redundant roles in the raldh2 mutant or morphant. But BMS453, a pan-retinoic acid receptor antagonist, was able to achieve a more complete inhibition of RA signaling. Second, maternal Raldh2 protein or mRNA plays an important role in setting up the left-sided Nodal signal. Actually, maternal transcripts of raldh2, raldh3, and raldh4 have all been reported in zebrafish (46Alexa K. Choe S.K. Hirsch N. Etheridge L. Laver E. Sagerström C.G. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 47Liang D. Zhang M. Bao J. Zhang L. Xu X. Gao X. Zhao Q. Gene Expr. Patterns. 2008; 8: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). From this aspect, BMS453 or DEAB could also achieve a more complete inhibition of RA signaling. Third, RA antagonists result in stronger phenotypes than raldh2 mutation, which has been reported in two raldh2 mutant alleles in zebrafish (46Alexa K. Choe S.K. Hirsch N. Etheridge L. Laver E. Sagerström C.G. PLoS One. 2009; 4: e8261Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Fourth, raldh2 morpholino only represents a knockdown of Raldh2. A certain percentage of Raldh2 activity may still exist. Therefore, differences between chemical inhibitors and genetic inactivation have been sufficiently interpreted.Although RA signaling is required in more than one aspect of visceral organ development, such as pancreas differentiation and visceral laterality (29Jiang Z. Song J. Qi F. Xiao A. An X. Liu N.A. Zhu Z. Zhang B. Lin S. PLoS Biol. 2008; 6: e293Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1), our results demonstrate that LR effects of BMS453 treatment on heart and visceral organs are specific other than indirect. First, both predominantly right-sided distribution of spawMO and unilaterally left-sided distribution of exogenous spaw mRNA specifically rescued randomization of visceral laterality but not defective pancreas differentiation caused by BMS453 (Figs. 1, F and G, and 4, G, H, M, and N). Second, both BMS453 treatments before and after 2So caused no obvious early phenotype up to 25 hpf when laterality decisions have already been made (supplemental Fig. S6), ruling out the possibility that the LR phenotypes are indirect effects of earlier phenotypes. Third, defective laterality of heart and visceral organs caused by DEAB could be efficiently rescued by exogenous RA (Figs. 1K and 2O). Fourth, BMS453 or DEAB treatments led to differentiation phenotypes of cardiac progenitors before 2So (Fig. 2, C–E and I–K) and defective heart laterality mainly after 2So (Fig. 2, F–H and L–N). They are temporally separated.BMS453 and DEAB lead to similar laterality phenotypes at the same stage, which confirms that the phenotypes are due to blockage of RA signaling. However, BMS453 appears to be a stronger RA antagonist than DEAB. First, BMS453 treatment from 32-cell to 2So leads to a complete absence of exocrine pancreas as well as dramatic reduction of β-cells (Figs. 1, F and G, and 4, D–H, M, and N). In contrast, a residual of exocrine pancreas and mild reduction of β-cells were observed in the majority of embryos treated with DEAB (Fig. 1, I and J). Second, ratios of defective heart laterality were a little higher in embryos treated with BMS453 than DEAB (Fig. 2, C–O). These differences between BMS453 and DEAB can be explained by different mechanisms of how these chemicals work. BMS453, whose inhibitory effects cannot be rescued by exogenous RA, is a pan-retinoic acid receptor antagonist. DEAB is an inhibitor of RA synthase, and its effects can be efficiently rescued by exogenous RA.Both fgf8 knockdown and overexpression resulted in decreases in charon transcription around KV (5Hong S.K. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S4, A–C), indicating that a certain Fgf8 concentration is necessary for charon activation. This also explains why decreases in charon transcription after BMS453 treatment were exacerbated by a high concentration of fgf8MO, but partially rescued by a low concentration of fgf8MO (supplemental Fig. S4, D–F).Increases in heart size and expansion of cardiac bmp4 expression caused by BMS453 or DEAB treatment from 32-cell to 2So (Figs. 2, C–E and I–K, and 6B) should result from increases in cell number of cardiac progenitors (48Keegan B.R. Feldman J.L. Begemann G. Ingham P.W. Yelon D. Science. 2005; 307: 247-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 49Waxman J.S. Keegan B.R. Roberts R.W. Poss K.D. Yelon D. Dev. Cell. 2008; 15: 923-934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Because cardiac looping is not only controlled by the laterality decisions but also affected by the differentiation of cardiomyocyte, the mild role of RA signaling before 2So in regulating heart laterality could be a result of increases in cardiac progenitors. It is also possible that RA signaling before 2So mildly regulates heart laterality through the left-sided Nodal signal or other unknown mechanisms. At 22So, the asymmetric, bilateral cardiac primordia have fused in zebrafish. In embryos treated with BMS453, although there is no delay in embryonic development (supplemental Fig. S5), the bilateral cardiac primoridia have not yet fused (Fig. 6, B–E). This delay in fusion of cardiac primordia could be a result of perturbed heart laterality, or a result of increases in cardiac progenitors, or an independent effect.Knockdown of Bmp4 in the dorsal forerunner cells or ectopic expression of noggin3 lead to bilateral expression of spaw (21Chocron S. Verhoeven M.C. Rentzsch F. Hammerschmidt M. Bakkers J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). However, except for unaffected formation of KV in bmp4 morphant, mechanisms underlying regulation of the left-sided Nodal signal by bmp4 remain unknown. Expression patterns during gastrulation (only in the ventral region and prechordal plate) precludes Bmp4 as an upstream factor of RA and FGF signaling in regulating ciliogenesis. Expression of bmp4 around KV at 10So remained unaffected in embryos treated with BMS453 from 32-cell to 2So (supplemental Fig. S7), excluding bmp4 as a downstream factor of RA signaling. Therefore, unlike RA and FGF signaling that regulate cilia length, bmp4 most probably plays parts in other aspects of ciliogenesis or even independent of ciliogenesis.Both blockage of RA signaling and exogenous RA represent disturbance of LR asymmetry under the control of RA signaling, which could explain why both BMS453 and RA treatments do lead to similar effects on the left-sided Nodal signal (34Tsukui T. Capdevila J. Tamura K. Ruiz-Lozano P. Rodriguez-Esteban C. Yonei-Tamura S. Magallón J. Chandraratna R.A. Chien K. Blumberg B. Evans R.M. Belmonte J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 11376-11381Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). It has been reported that spaw morphant displays disturbed cardiac bmp4 asymmetry as well as defective heart laterality (11Long S. Ahmad N. Rebagliati M. Development. 2003; 130: 2303-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 21Chocron S. Verhoeven M.C. Rentzsch F. Hammerschmidt M. Bakkers J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and reversed asymmetry of lefty2 is accompanied by reversed heart laterality (50Baker K. Holtzman N.G. Burdine R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 13924-13929Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, it is likely that if the left-sided Nodal is present, repression of the Nodal signal in the right LPM is less significant for cardiac bmp4 asymmetry and heart laterality (Figs. 2C, 3, B and H, and 6B). In other words, the Nodal asymmetry could be inconsistent with cardiac bmp4 asymmetry and heart laterality. This inconsistency has been previously reported both in mice and zebrafish (44Niederreither K. Vermot J. Messaddeq N. Schuhbaur B. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 2001; 128: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Lopes S.S. Lourenço R. Pacheco L. Moreno N. Kreiling J. Saúde L. Development. 2010; 137: 3625-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One reference showed normal sideness of Nodal signal in the LPM of raldh2−/− mouse, but its heart laterality was defective (44Niederreither K. Vermot J. Messaddeq N. Schuhbaur B. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 2001; 128: 1019-1031Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The other showed bilateral expression of spaw in aei−/− zebrafish mutant, but its heart laterality remains unaffected (51Lopes S.S. Lourenço R. Pacheco L. Moreno N. Kreiling J. Saúde L. Development. 2010; 137: 3625-3632Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The concomitance of asymmetrically normal spaw and lefty2, correct visceral laterality, disturbed cardiac bmp4, and aberrant heart laterality (Figs. 1H, 2, F–H, 3, C and I, and 6E) indicates that cardiac bmp4 asymmetry and heart laterality are not under the direct control of the left-sided Nodal signal, and cardiac bmp4 is insignificant to the determination of visceral laterality. Furthermore, from our results, although LR asymmetry is phenotypically evident first in the heart, its laterality determination even takes place later than that of visceral organs.Taken together, our data suggest that RA signaling regulates LR patterning of organs at two stages, shedding new light on how concordance of visceral and heart laterality is achieved. Before 2So, RA signaling regulates cilia length and directional fluid flow in KV by the mediation of fgf8. This is critical for setting up the left-sided Nodal signal that dictates visceral laterality. From 2So on, because a possible new RA resource appears in the anterior LPM, the mild regulatory role of RA signaling before 2So in controlling heart laterality becomes much more significant after 2So through asymmetric cardiac bmp4. IntroductionDuring vertebrate development, left-right (LR) 2The abbreviations used are: LRleft-rightLPMlateral plate mesodermDEAB4-diethylaminobenzaldehydeMOmorpholino oligoRAretinoic acidSosomite stageDMSOdimethyl sulfoxidehpfhours post-fertilizationEepiboly stage. asymmetry is evident both in heart and visceral organs such as liver, pancreas, and gut. Situs inversus totalis, in which there is complete right to left reversal of the thoracic and abdominal organs, occurs once in about 8,000 persons. Although situs inversus is usually of no medical consequence, heterotaxia, incomplete reversal of organs, occurs with higher frequency and causes significant medical problems. These problems are observed not only in humans but also in nearly all vertebrates in whom LR asymmetry needs to be established during development. In zebrafish, LR asymmetric signals are first established around KV, a ciliated organ that generates directional fluid flow (1Essner J.J. Vogan K.J. Wagner M.K. Tabin C.J. Yost H.J. Brueckner M. Nature. 2002; 418: 37-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 2Essner J.J. Amack J.D. Nyholm M.K. Harris E.B. Yost H.J.

Ciliogenesis, key to the initiation of LR asymmetry, is dependent on fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling (4Neugebauer J.M. Amack J.D. Peterson A.G. Bisgrove B.W. Yost H.J. Nature. 2009; 458: 651-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 5Hong S.K. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 2230-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Then, LR asymmetry is conveyed and stabilized in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM), patterning left and right sides of the embryo (6Raya A. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A critical event of LR patterning at this stage is the left-sided expression of nodal/southpaw (spaw) in the LPM (7Levin M. Johnson R.L. Stern C.D. Kuehn M. Tabin C. Cell. 1995; 82: 803-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 8Collignon J. Varlet I. Robertson E.J.

The left-sided Nodal/Spaw then activates lefty1 in the ventral neural tube, lefty2 and pitx2 in the LPM, all exclusively on the left side (12Meno C. Ito Y. Saijoh Y. Matsuda Y. Tashiro K. Kuhara S. Hamada H. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 513-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 13Meno C. Saijoh Y. Fujii H. Ikeda M. Yokoyama T. Yokoyama M. Toyoda Y. Hamada H.

Lefty1 and Lefty2 antagonize Nodal activity, thus generating a negative feedback loop to restrict the extent and duration of Nodal signaling. The left-sided expression of nodal/spaw, lefty2, and pitx2 are highly conserved in vertebrates to ensure proper LR patterning (6Raya A. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 283-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).Retinoic acid (RA) and bone morphogenetic protein signals have been reported to regulate several aspects of LR asymmetry. Treatment of RA antagonist leads to randomization of heart looping and perturbed sideness of nodal in mouse (16Chazaud C. Chambon P. Dollé P. Development. 1999; 126: 2589-2596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but roles of RA signaling in the determination of heart and visceral laterality in zebrafish remain unknown. In Xenopus, chick, and mouse, bone morphogenetic protein signaling is required to repress Nodal activity in the right LPM, thus ensuring right-sided laterality (17Ramsdell A.F. Yost H.J. Development. 1999; 126: 5195-5205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Rodríguez Esteban C. Capdevila J. Economides A.N. Pascual J. Ortiz A. Izpisúa Belmonte J.C.

Biol. 2000; 219: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In zebrafish, bone morphogenetic protein signaling regulates LR asymmetry at two distinct developmental time points. Shortly after KV has been formed during early segmentation, bone morphogenetic protein signaling is necessary to repress spaw in the right LPM, similar to other vertebrates (21Chocron S. Verhoeven M.C. Rentzsch F. Hammerschmidt M. Bakkers J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In later segmentation at around the 22-somite (22So) stage prior to the initiation of cardiac jogging, bmp4 is asymmetrically distributed in the cardiac field with stronger expression on the left side (22Chen J.N. van Eeden F.J. Warren K.S. Chin A. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Haffter P. Fishman M.C. Development. 1997; 124: 4373-4382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This asymmetric bmp4 is required for the determination of heart laterality (21Chocron S. Verhoeven M.C. Rentzsch F. Hammerschmidt M. Bakkers J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 22Chen J.N. van Eeden F.J. Warren K.S. Chin A. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Haffter P. Fishman M.C.

Cell. 2008; 14: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).Ectopic expression of bmp4 on the right side results in reversal of heart laterality, but visceral organs are unaffected (24Schilling T.F. Concordet J.P. Ingham P.W. Dev. Biol. 1999; 210: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Induction of exogenous noggin3 at the 16-somite stage causes perturbation of heart laterality, but visceral laterality remains normal (21Chocron S. Verhoeven M.C. Rentzsch F. Hammerschmidt M. Bakkers J. Dev. Biol. 2007; 305: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). High occurrence of heterotaxia in nature proposes that asymmetries of heart and visceral organs may involve different regulatory mechanisms and need to be coordinated. However, key mechanistic differences and concordance between visceral and heart laterality during LR patterning remain to be elucidated.Here we demonstrate that inhibition of RA signaling before 2So leads to randomized laterality of visceral organs through bilateral expression of spaw, which resulted from increases in cilia length and defective directional fluid flow in KV. Fgf8 is required to mediate the control of cilia length by RA signaling. Inhibition of RA signaling before 2So also results in mild defects of heart laterality, which become much more severe through disturbance of cardiac bmp4 asymmetry when RA signaling is blocked after 2So. However, visceral laterality and left-sided spaw and lefty2 remain unaffected at this stage. Our study first identifies RA signaling as the key signaling pathway that sequentially controls visceral and heart laterality, so that RA signaling achieves their concordance during LR patterning."
https://openalex.org/W1980948385,"Background Overcoming spaceflight-induced (patho)physiologic adaptations is a major challenge preventing long-term deep space exploration. RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as a promising therapeutic for combating diseases on Earth; however the efficacy of RNAi in space is currently unknown. Methods Caenorhabditis elegans were prepared in liquid media on Earth using standard techniques and treated acutely with RNAi or a vector control upon arrival in Low Earth Orbit. After culturing during 4 and 8 d spaceflight, experiments were stopped by freezing at −80°C until analysis by mRNA and microRNA array chips, microscopy and Western blot on return to Earth. Ground controls (GC) on Earth were simultaneously grown under identical conditions. Results After 8 d spaceflight, mRNA expression levels of components of the RNAi machinery were not different from that in GC (e.g., Dicer, Argonaute, Piwi; P>0.05). The expression of 228 microRNAs, of the 232 analysed, were also unaffected during 4 and 8 d spaceflight (P>0.05). In spaceflight, RNAi against green fluorescent protein (gfp) reduced chromosomal gfp expression in gonad tissue, which was not different from GC. RNAi against rbx-1 also induced abnormal chromosome segregation in the gonad during spaceflight as on Earth. Finally, culture in RNAi against lysosomal cathepsins prevented degradation of the muscle-specific α-actin protein in both spaceflight and GC conditions. Conclusions Treatment with RNAi works as effectively in the space environment as on Earth within multiple tissues, suggesting RNAi may provide an effective tool for combating spaceflight-induced pathologies aboard future long-duration space missions. Furthermore, this is the first demonstration that RNAi can be utilised to block muscle protein degradation, both on Earth and in space."
https://openalex.org/W2166977752,"Cyclic AMP-responsive element binding protein 1 (CREB1) plays multiple functions as a transcription factor in gene regulation. CREB1 proteins are also known to be expressed in several spliced isoforms that act as transcriptional activators or repressors. The activator isoforms, possessing the functional domains for kinase induction and for interaction with other transcriptional regulators, act as transcriptional activators. On the other hand, some isoforms, lacking those functional domains, are reported to be repressors that make heterodimers with activator isoforms. The complex and ingenious function for CREB1 arises in part from the variation in their spliced isoforms, which allows them to interact with each other. To date, however, the dimerization between the activator and repressor isoforms has not yet been proved directly in living cells. In this study, we applied fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) to demonstrate direct observation of dimerization between CREB1 activator and repressor. The FCCS is a well established spectroscopic method to determine the interaction between the different fluorescent molecules in the aqueous condition. Using differently labeled CREB1 isoforms, we successfully observed the interaction of CREB1 activator and repressor via dimerization in the nuclei of cultured cells. As a result, we confirmed the formation of heterodimer between CREB1 activator and repressor isoforms in living cells."

RNAPI synthesizes the large rRNA precursor. Transcription at ribosomal RNA core promoters is initiated by the TATA binding protein (TBP) and TBP-associated factors (TAF1s) forming a preinitiation complex (PIC). In human cells, this complex is called SL1 and contains TBP and the TAF1s TAF1110, TAF163, TAFI48, and TAFI41. The TAF1 equivalents in fission and budding yeast are called Rrn6, Rrn7, and Rrn11, respectively, and are found with TBP in a complex called core factor (1Laferté A. Favry E. Sentenac A. Riva M.

TBP binds to the TATA box complexed with TFIID (TAF11s) followed by the other GTFs TFIIB, TFIIF, TFIIE, and TFIIH, respectively, to complete PIC formation for the recruitment of pol II (4Orphanides G.

It was shown to mediate transcription initiation in vivo, but even more interesting, it also determines the transcriptional start sites, thus functioning as a TATA analog in a core promoter (9Witt I. Straub N. Käufer N.F. Gross T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Witt I. Kwart M. Gross T. Käufer N.F.

Käufer N.F. Egel R. The Molecular Biology of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Springer, Berlin2004: 343-351Google Scholar). On the basis of these experimental findings and followed by computational analyses, it was suggested that Schizosaccharomyces pombe genes involved in ribosome synthesis contain a core promoter in which the HomolD box is the CPE, which in some of these promoters is joined immediately upstream by a highly conserved sequence called the HomolE box (9Witt I. Straub N. Käufer N.F. Gross T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Witt I. Kwart M. Gross T. Käufer N.F.

Käufer N.F. Egel R. The Molecular Biology of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Springer, Berlin2004: 343-351Google Scholar). Indeed, a computational analysis comparing the regulatory modules in ribosomal protein (RP) gene promoters of many yeast species confirms these observations and presents the HomolD and HomolE elements found in S. pombe promoters as a remarkable example of regulatory divergence from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where the RAP1- and the IFHL sites represent the regulatory modules in RP gene promoters (13Tanay A. Regev A. Shamir R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7203-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the last few years of intensive computational analysis of genomic sequences from different organisms, it turned out that the percentage of classical TATA box-containing core promoters of protein-encoding genes identified in genomes is low. In fact, it has been described that in human and mice promoters, the prevalence of TATA-less promoters is 90% (14Carninci P. Sandelin A. Lenhard B. Katayama S. Shimokawa K. Ponjavic J. Semple C.A.

Genome Res. 2006; 16: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) Therefore, we searched the Eukaryotic Promoter Database for HomolD box sequences in regions that are defined as core promoters. There are several core promoter regions that contain a HomolD box, including human core promoters, found upstream of several protein-encoding genes such as ATPase and G-protein subunits (unpublished data 4J. Contreras-Levicoy, S. Moreira-Ramos, D. A. Rojas, F. Urbina, and E. Maldonado, unpublished data. ). Although the total number of HomolD box-containing core promoters in genomic sequences is small, it appears that promoters with a HomolD box are found throughout the genomes of eukaryotic organisms. In this report we demonstrate for the first time that HomolD-directed transcription is RNAPII-dependent and requires GTFs from the RNAPII machinery. We identify a protein fraction with binding activity to a HomolD box affinity column. This protein fraction contained Rrn7, which is a transcription initiation factor of the RNAPI machinery operating at core rDNA promoters. We demonstrate that Rrn7 has HomolD box-specific binding activity in vitro and in vivo. These results clearly make Rrn7 an excellent candidate to be the mediator of the cross-talk between rDNA and ribosomal protein gene transcription during ribosome biogenesis. The rpK5 promoter was cloned by PCR using specific primers (forward, 5′-TGCAAAAGAAGTGTCTGCGTTAAAGCATCA-3′; and reverse 5′-GGGGTTGTTGG AGAATACGGTATTGAGGTTGCA-3′) that contain BamHI and SmaI recognition sites, respectively. Genomic DNA purified from strain 972 h−s of fission yeast S. pombe was used as template. The PCR products generated were digested and ligated in the BamHI/SmaI sites of pUC19. The G-minus cassette was amplified by PCR from a vector called pG5, as described previously (17Tamayo E. Bernal G. Teno U. Maldonado E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2561-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Sawadogo M. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1985; 82: 4394-4398Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Specific primers (forward, 5′-CATACCCTTCCTCCATCTATACC-3′; and reverse, 5′-TGGAATGAGAAATGAGTGTGA-3′) were used and combined with the rpK5 promoter fragment from above. The vector containing the rpK5 promoter G-minus cassette was linearized with EcoRI and used as template for PCR amplification using specific primers. Three promoter constructs were made using primers with the HomolD box wild-type sequence (5′-TTTGGATAGGCGAAAACAGTCACAT TTTACAACAACAATTCAC-3′), with two point mutations in the Homol D box (5′-TTTGGATAGGCGAAAACTGTGACATTTTACAACAACAATTCAC-3′), and with a HomolD box inverted (5′-TTTGGATAGGCGAAAAGTCAGTGTTTTTACAACAACAATTCAC-3). The reverse primer was the same for all three constructs (5′-TAGATTTGGGAAATATAGA AGAAG-3′). For primer extension assays, 3 μg of each construct were mixed with 12 μl of p10X buffer (500 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 900 mm l-glutamic acid potassium salt, 150 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mm EGTA, 25 mm DTT, 10% glycerol), 7 μl of PEG 20K, 4 μl of S. pombe whole cell extract (WCE). The reaction mix was incubated for 10 min at room temperature, and then 12 μl of E10X mixture (4 mm rATP, 4 mm rCTP, 4 mm rGTP, 4 mm rUTP, 80 mm phosphoenole pyruvic acid), 0.8 μl of RNasin (Promega Corp.), and H-O buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol) were added to a final volume of 120 ml. The reaction mix was incubated for 45 min at 30 °C, and then stop solution (10 mm EDTA, 200 mm sodium acetate, 0.2% SDS, 1 mg/ml DNA salmon sperm) was added, followed by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The RNA pellet was resuspended in 14 μl of water and annealed with the 32P-labeled oligonucleotide 5′-TAGATTTGGGAAATATAGAAGAAG-3′. 100 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega Corp.) and dNTPs (0.5 mm of each) were added and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. cDNA products were ethanol-precipitated, resuspended in 95% formamide, denatured, and separated on an 6% polyacrylamide (40:1 ratio) denaturing gel. Gels were dried and exposed to film. In vitro transcription was performed as described previously using 0.5 μg of DNA in the assay (17Tamayo E. Bernal G. Teno U. Maldonado E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2561-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). For immunodepletion, WCE was incubated at room temperature for 30 min with 1 μg of the appropriate antibody. Then 0 or 100 ng of the specific general transcription factor was added to the assay. Each binding mix contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 2% PEG 20K, 2 mm DTT, 0.1 mm PMSF, 50 μg BSA, and 500 ng of poly(dI.dC) for semipurified extracts or 25 ng for affinity fractions or recombinant protein. The proteins were incubated with the binding mix for 5 min at room temperature, and then 20–40 ng end-labeled HomolD box probe from the rpK5 gene or HomolD* probe from the rDNA promoter (approximately 20,000 cpm) was added and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. In competitive binding assays, a 10-, 100-, and 200-fold excess of unlabeled probe was added. The DNA-protein complexes were analyzed at 4 °C in an 8% acrylamide, 0.2% bisacrylamide (39:1 ratio), 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3) gel. The gel was prerun at 4 °C for 1 h at 100 V. The gel was dried and exposed to film for 3 days. For Kd determination, three independent assays were performed with a constant amount of recombinant protein and increasing concentrations of labeled probe containing HomolD or HomolD* from 5 to 2000 nm. PhosphorImager was used for quantification, and the amount of protein-bound and protein-free labeled DNA probe in each assay was determined. Data were fitted, and saturation and Scatchard plots were generated using GraphPad Prism version 4.00 software for Mac OSX (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Bacterial BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET15b containing the ORF of Rrn7 and plated on Luria-Bertoni-agar containing ampicillin. A single colony was inoculated in 500 ml of Terrific Broth medium supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/ml) and grown at 37 °C to an A600 nm of 0.8. The production of recombinant proteins was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and the culture was grown at 37 °C for an additional period of 4 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 ml of STE buffer (100 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-Hcl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA) with lysozyme (0.35 mg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Then, the cells were sonicated, and the recombinant protein was purified as described previously (17Tamayo E. Bernal G. Teno U. Maldonado E. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 2561-2572Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). ChIP was performed with slight modifications, as described by Jbel et al. (19Jbel M. Mercier A. Pelletier B. Beaudoin J. Labbé S. Eukaryot. Cell. 2009; 8: 649-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Chromatin was isolated from a wild-type strain (972 h−s), a strain expressing TAP-Rrn7, and a strain expressing both TAP-Rrn7 and HA-Rrn11. Immunoprecipitations were performed using 2 μg of anti-TAP tag (A00683, GenScript) or anti-HA tag (ab9110, Abcam, Inc.). Primer sequences were designed for the rpK5 gene core promoter, including the HomolD box, TSSs, and the first 11 amino acid residues of the protein. Forward, 5′ GGATGACCGAAAACAGTCAC 3′; and reverse, 5′ CCTCCACTCTTTCTTTGTGC 3′). Primer pairs for amplification of the nmt1 gene core promoter: forward, 5′ GGAATCCGATTGTCATTCGG 3′; and reverse, 5′ GGAAAGTGATCTTGTTAGTAG 3′. Primers pairs for amplification of the rDNA core promoter (HomolD*): forward, 5′ GGAGGGATATGGAAGAAAGG 3′; and reverse, 5′ CTCCTTTCAACCACCACTCC 3′. As an internal control, primers were designed for the amplification of parts of the open reading frame of the act1 gene (20Du L.L. Nakamura T.M. Russell P. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1583-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown to an A600 nm of 0.5 in 25 ml of YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% D-glucose). Cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold IP buffer (50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl) supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 0.1 mm PMSF (wash buffer). Cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of wash buffer supplemented with 0.1 mm DTT. Glass beads (G8772, Sigma) were added to the cells, and then the mix was placed on vortex for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysates were transferred to a new tube. Glass beads were washed with 0.5 ml of wash buffer, and supernatant was added to the other 0.5 ml of lysate. 1-ml aliquots were centrifuged at top speed at 4 °C, and supernatants were placed in a new tube. 30 μl of protein A-agarose beads were preincubated with 2 μg of anti-TAP tag (A00683, GenScript) or anti-HA tag (ab9110, Abcam) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed three times with IP buffer plus 0.1% Nonidet P-40. These beads were added to the lysates. After 1 h of incubation, beads were spun down and washed three times with ice-cold wash buffer and twice with only IP buffer. Finally, the beads were resuspended with 50 μl of 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the supernatants were analyzed by Western blot analysis. The DNA affinity column was constructed with CNBr-activated-Sepharose as described by Kadonaga and Tjian (21Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1986; 83: 5889-5893Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Fission yeast strains expressing TAP-Rrn7 and HA-Rrn11 were constructed as described in Newo et al. (22Newo A.N. Lützelberger M. Bottner C.A. Wehland J. Wissing J. Jänsch L. Käufer N.F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 1391-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We and others have developed a highly purified in vitro transcription system for S. pombe RNAPII transcription. Using typical TATA box containing promoters fused to a G-minus cassette, it was shown that the GTFs TFIID (Tbp1 + TAFs), TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH are necessary and sufficient for proper initiation and basal transcription from these TATA box promoter templates (23Flores O. Maldonado E. Reinberg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8913-8921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Maldonado E. Ha I. Cortes P. Weis L. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6335-6347Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 25Contreras-Levicoy J. Urbina F. Maldonado E. FEBS J. 2008; 275: 2873-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, to investigate whether HomolD box containing promoters are transcribed in vitro by the RNAPII system, we fused the HomolD box-containing promoter of the ribosomal protein gene rpK5 (GeneDB, SPAC1F7.13c) to a G-minus cassette. Three templates were constructed as shown in Fig. 1A. The HomolD box (CAGTCACA, WT) in this promoter has been shown to initiate basal transcription of the lacZ gene as a reporter in vivo and determines two TSSs 49 and 51 nt downstream of the HomolD box, whereas mutations in the HomolD box to CTGTGACA (mut) abolished expression of the reporter gene in vivo (9Witt I. Straub N. Käufer N.F. Gross T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The third template contains the sequence TGTGACTG (inv), which is the inverted form of the HomolD box (WT) found in many genes containing this core promoter (12Witt I. Käufer N.F. Egel R. The Molecular Biology of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Springer, Berlin2004: 343-351Google Scholar and introduction). To study whether basal transcription can be initiated from these templates, we used S. pombe WCE as an in vitro system. As shown in Fig. 1B, the WCE is able to support basal transcription from the template containing the HomolD box WT and inv, respectively, whereas the template containing the mutated HomolD box (mut) does not show an in vitro transcript. Addition of α-amanitine, a strong inhibitor of RNAPII, to the reaction abolished transcription from both HomolD box core promoters (WT, inv) indicating that RNAPII is the enzyme that initiates transcription from these promoters (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, primer extension analysis after the reaction shows that basal transcription in vitro is initiated at two TSSs downstream of the HomolD box (WT and inv) comparable with the situation found in vivo (Fig. 1C, 9Witt I. Straub N. Käufer N.F. Gross T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To determine whether the GTFs of the RNAPII system are involved in the initiation of transcription from the HomolD box template (WT), WCEs were depleted of the GTFs TBP (Tbp1), TAF1, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIH, and TFIIF using antibodies against each GTF. Antibodies were made against whole proteins (Tbp1, TAF1, and TFIIB) or specific subunits (TFIIEβ, Tfb1, and TFIIFβ) (supplemental Fig. S2). In the depleted extracts, basal transcription was initiated from the HomolD box template only when the appropriate purified GTF was added (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that HomolD box core promoters in S. pombe are transcribed in vitro by the RNAPII system. Our earlier attempts to characterize HomolD core promoters led us to suggest that the HomolD box is most likely the target of a protein with different biochemical features than the TBP in fission yeast called Tbp1 (9Witt I. Straub N. Käufer N.F. Gross T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 12Witt I. Käufer N.F. Egel R. The Molecular Biology of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Springer, Berlin2004: 343-351Google Scholar). Therefore, we set out to isolate binding activity to HomolD boxes by fractionating WCE as indicated in Fig. 2A. As probes in EMSAs to measure binding activity, we used oligonucleotides containing the HomolD box WT and mut, respectively, of the rpK5 promoter shown in Fig. 1A. Both WCE and the heparin fraction showed specific binding activity. Increasing amounts of unlabeled probe (WT) competed out the shifted complex(es), whereas the unlabeled probe mut does not act as a strong competitor (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, we examined whether TBP (Tbp1) binds to HomolD box-containing DNA. Because several TAFs of the TFIID complex as well as TFIIB have been shown to bind to DNA and have been described to participate in PIC establishment in TATA-less promoters (26Verrijzer C.P. Chen J.L. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 27Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 28Lee D.H. Gershenzon N. Gupta M. Ioshikhes I.P. Reinberg D. Lewis B.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9674-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), we also checked TFIID and TFIIB for binding activity. As can be seen in Fig. 2C, the HomolD-containing rpK5 promoter does not bind the GTFs TFIIB, TFIID, or TBP alone. Neither of the indicated purified protein fractions led to a shift of the labeled HomolD probe in EMSAs. These results confirm the previous in vivo studies and demonstrate that the HomolD box is not targeted by Tbp1 (9Witt I. Straub N. Käufer N.F. Gross T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To identify the HomolD box binding protein(s), we chose to isolate the protein(s) of the heparin fraction by using an affinity purification step. For this purpose, the HomolD box was coupled to CNBr-activated-Sepharose, and the heparin protein fraction was bound to the HomolD matrix under low-salt conditions (50 mm KCl). Subsequently, the bound material was washed with 0.1 m KCl and then eluted using a buffer with a high salt concentration (0.5 m KCl). All fractions were evaluated for binding activity with EMSA using the WT HomolD box-containing promoter as a probe. The eluate still shows binding activity, as indicated by the shift of the HomolD probe migrating to positions identical with the heparin fraction (I) that was applied to the column (Fig. 2D). The fractions eluted at 0.1 and 0.5 m KCl, respectively, were separated on SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie blue. Three major bands can be visualized in the fractions eluted from the column with 0.5 m KCl (Fig. 2E). The proteins eluted from the HomolD box affinity column were determined by mass spectrometry. After SDS-PAGE, the three stained bands (Fig. 2E, K1, K2, K3) were individually subjected to in-gel digestion, and the eluted peptides were sequenced and identified by liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). With this approach, we detected in band K1 with the highest peptide coverage a protein called Sec8 (UniProtKB O74562, located in secretory vessels and involved in cell elongation and septum formation). Band K2 revealed a mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase (UniProtKB O74484, Mpg1, involved in cell wall integrity and septum formation). Finally, band K3 contained peptides of a protein called Rrn7 (UniProtKB Q9UST5, RNA polymerase I-specific transcription initiation factor). To the best of our knowledge, there is no report or any other indication that Sec8 or Mpg1 might be DNA binding proteins or involved in transcription. However, Rrn7 has been characterized in S. pombe and has been shown to be the orthologue of human TAF163, which binds in a complex (selectivity factor 1 (SL1) in human and core factor in yeast) with TBP to the rDNA core promoters to mediate transcription initiation by RNAPI. In addition, the core rDNA promoters of S. pombe contain a TATA box element around position −35 upstream of the TSS which, when mutated, impairs but does not prevent transcription initiation of the core rDNA promoter (29Boukhgalter B. Liu M. Guo A. Tripp M. Tran K. Huynh C. Pape L. Gene. 2002; 291: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 30Russell J. Zomerdijk J.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2005; 30: 87-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). On the basis of these considerations, we decided to evaluate the heparin fraction for binding affinity to the rDNA core promoter using a 20-bp probe from −46 to −65 nt upstream of the TSS that lacks the TATA element (29Boukhgalter B. Liu M. Guo A. Tripp M. Tran K. Huynh C. Pape L. Gene. 2002; 291: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Noteworthy here is that this sequence of 20 bp shows a region of the rDNA core promoter that is broadly similar to the 40-bp HomolD box probe used here, including the HomolD sequence. We call this sequence in the rDNA core promoter HomolD* (Fig. 3A). As can be seen in Fig. 3B, the heparin fraction shows specific binding activity when WT rDNA (HomolD*) is used as a probe. Even at low concentrations, the unlabeled WT rDNA outcompetes the shifted complex easily, whereas the unlabeled probe mut rDNA hardly acts as a competitor. There is no indication that the heparin fraction contains, besides Rrn7, other polymerase I transcription factors. Therefore, we used recombinant Rrn7 and determined the binding affinity of the recombinant protein to the HomolD box probe as well as to the rDNA (HomolD*) probe. For this purpose, we performed EMSAs and competition assays. Recombinant Rrn7 binds to the rDNA (HomolD*) probe, causing a mobility shift of the WT rDNA, which cannot be competed with by unlabeled mut rDNA (Fig. 3C). Recombinant Rrn7 also binds to the HomolD box probe, which easily can be competed with by the unlabeled wt HomolD probe. The unlabeled scrambled HomolD probe, in which the nucleotides of the HomolD box have been randomized, does not compete at all for binding. In addition, the unlabeled mut HomolD probe displaying the two point mutations, which abolish in vitro transcription, also does not compete effectively for binding (Fig. 3D). To determine the dissociation constant of recombinant Rrn7, we performed an EMSA with a constant amount of protein while increasing the concentration of the probe. The Kd determined for HomolD was 248.7 ± 35.7 nm and 198.9 ± 44.7 nm for HomolD* (supplemental Fig. S3). These results show that the affinity for both sequences is low but suggest that binding of Rrn7 to the HomolD box as well as to the rDNA (HomolD*) sequence is possible without additional binding partners. We also investigated whether recombinant Rrn7 can direct in vitro transcription from the HomolD box promoter. After depletion of endogenous Rrn7 and adding recombinant Rrn7 to WCE, we recovered in an in vitro transcription assay significant transcription activity (supplemental Fig. S3). This suggests that Rrn7 is acting at HomolD box promoters independently of the other core factor complex members. In a first attempt to determine whether Rrn7 associates with HomolD box core promoters in vivo, we used the chromatin IP method, in which proteins are cross-linked in vivo to DNA. The presence of individual proteins near specific DNA sequences is monitored by IP of the protein followed by PCR analysis of the coprecipitated DNA region. For this purpose, we fused epitope tags to Rrn7 and replaced the wild-type rrn7+ gene with its TAP-tagged version, now expressing TAP-Rrn7 proteins. We also fused an HA epitope tag to Rrn11 and replaced the wild-type rrn11+gene with the HA-tagged version. Finally, we constructed a strain that coexpresses TAP-Rrn7 and HA-Rrn11. First, we tested whether the fusion protein TAP-Rrn7 still has DNA binding activity. Second, we tested whether TAP-Rrn7 coprecipitates HA-Rrn11. TAP-Rrn7 still binds in vitro to the rDNA core promoter region, and TAP-Rrn7 coprecipitates with HA-Rrn11 and vice versa (supplemental Fig. S4). Next, we immunoprecipitated chromatin (ChIP) from cells expressing Rrn7 and Rrn11 (WT) and from cells expressing TAP-Rrn7 and HA-Rrn11 using IgG and anti-HA antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were tested for the presence of the core HomolD box promoter of the rpK5 gene by PCR using the primer pair as indicated in Fig. 4C. The rpK5 gene is one of three genes encoding ribosomal protein Rpl8, which was used to characterize HomolD promoters in vivo (9Witt I. Straub N. Käufer N.F. Gross T. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The promoter of the rpK5 gene displays a classical HomolD box promoter. As can be seen in Fig. 4, A and B, IP of TAP-Rrn7 followed by PCR reveals the presence of the rpK5 HomolD promoter, indicating that TAP-Rrn7 is associated with this promoter region. In contrast, IP of HA-Rrn11 followed by PCR clearly shows that Rrn11 is not associated with the rpK5 HomolD promoter region (Fig. 4, A and B). However, when the IPs are followed by PCR using specific primers for the putative HomolD core promoter of an rDNA transcription unit (HomolD* in Fig. 4C), TAP-Rrn7 as well as HA-Rrn11 coprecipitate the core promoter region of the rDNA unit, thus indicating that Rrn7 and Rrn11 bind to the rDNA core promoter. The results presented here clearly demonstrate that TAP-Rrn7, but not HA-Rrn11, associates specifically with the HomolD box promoter of the ribosomal protein gene, whereas no association of Rrn7 can be detected with the classical TATA box core promoter of the nmt1 gene (Fig. 4, A and B). The data we presented in this report are significant in several respects. First, HomolD boxes found in promoters of the ribosomal protein genes in fission yeast as well as in about 60 other housekeeping gene promoters represent TATA-less promoters. In these promoters, the HomolD box serves to initiate RNAPII-dependent transcription and determines the TSSs. The GTFs of the pol II system, including TBP, are recruited, but neither TFIID nor TBP alone binds directly to the HomolD box promoter sequence (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2). Thus, we provide evidence that the HomolD box is a genuine new CPE. In fact, HomolD box promoter elements are found in the genomes of other eukaryotic organisms. Second, we identified Rrn7 with a HomolD DNA affinity purification procedure, and we demonstrated that Rrn7 is the protein that directly binds to the HomolD box promoter in vitro (Fig. 3). Surprisingly, Rrn7 is a protein that has been shown to be involved in transcription initiation of rDNA promoters in fission yeast as well as in other eukaryotes. The orthologues of Rrn7 and Rrn11, human TAF163 and TAF148, respectively, are found complexed in SL1 containing TBP and the TAF1s TAF1110, TAF1 63, TAF148, and TAF141 (2Siddiqi I. Keener J. Vu L.

Third, we show that Rrn7 binds directly to rDNA core promoter sequences that show a similarity to HomolD boxes and their sequence context but are not identical with it. We call this region in the rDNA core promoter HomolD*. Noteworthy here is that we show for the first time sequence signatures to which the complex binds and demonstrate by ChIP analysis that, indeed, Rrn7 and Rrn11 are associated in vivo with the core promoter of the rDNA gene, including HomolD* (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 4). Fourth, in an attempt to demonstrate the involvement of Rrn7 in the transcription of ribosomal protein genes in vivo, we show by ChIP analysis that Rrn7 is associated with the HomolD box core promoter of the ribosomal protein gene rpK5 but is not associated with the TATA box-containing promoter of the nmt1 gene. In addition, Rrn11 is not associated with the HomolD core promoter of the rpK5 gene (Fig. 4). Taken together, our results presented here and previously support the notion that in fission yeast the regulatory network of ribosome biogenesis is based on promoter modules that clearly differ from those established in S. cerevisiae (13Tanay A. Regev A. Shamir R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 7203-7208Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that the transcriptional system involved in coordinating ribosome synthesis in fission yeast may represent an ancient eukaryotic transcription system (12Witt I. Käufer N.F. Egel R. The Molecular Biology of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Springer, Berlin2004: 343-351Google Scholar, 33Hamada M. Huang Y. Lowe T.M. Maraia R.J. Mol. Cell.

Here we provide evidence that in this system the transcription initiation factor Rrn7 is the link between pol I transcription of the rDNA genes and pol II transcription of the ribosomal protein genes. The finding of few but significant numbers of housekeeping genes containing a HomolD box in mammalian genes confirms the notion of the ancient transcription system. Therefore, it will be interesting and worthwhile, besides the further elucidation of the fission yeast system, to investigate the mechanism of transcription of HomolD box promoters in mammalian cells.

https://openalex.org/W2100593044,"The physiological and pathological functions of proteinase 3 (PR3) are not well understood due to its close similarity to human neutrophil elastase (HNE) and the lack of a specific inhibitor. Based on structural analysis of the active sites of PR3 and HNE, we generated mutants derived from the polyvalent inhibitor SerpinB1 (monocyte/neutrophil elastase inhibitor) that specifically inhibit PR3 and that differ from wt-SerpinB1 by only 3 or 4 residues in the reactive center loop. The rate constant of association between the best SerpinB1 mutant and PR3 is 1.4 × 107 M–1·s–1, which is ~100-fold higher than that observed with wt-SerpinB1 and compares with that of α1-protease inhibitor (α1-PI) toward HNE. SerpinB1(S/DAR) is cleaved by HNE, but due to differences in rate, inhibition of PR3 by SerpinB1(S/DAR) is only minimally affected by the presence of HNE even when the latter is in excess. SerpinB1(S/DAR) inhibits soluble PR3 and also membrane-bound PR3 at the surface of activated neutrophils. Moreover, SerpinB1(S/DAR) clears induced PR3 from the surface of activated neutrophils. Overall, these specific inhibitors of PR3 will be valuable for defining biological functions of the protease and may prove useful as therapeutics for PR3-related inflammatory diseases, such as Wegener's granulomatosis.—Jégot, G., Derache, C., Castella, S., Lahouassa, H., Pitois, E., Jourdan, M.

https://openalex.org/W2039607878,"Animal and human adult studies reveal a contribution of serotonin to behavior regulation. Whether these findings apply to children is unclear. The present study investigated serotonergic functioning in boys with a history of behavior regulation difficulties through a double-blind, acute tryptophan supplementation procedure.Participants were 23 boys (age 10 years) with a history of elevated physical aggression, recruited from a community sample. Eleven were given a chocolate milkshake supplemented with 500 mg tryptophan, and 12 received a chocolate milkshake without tryptophan. Boys engaged in a competitive reaction time game against a fictitious opponent, which assessed response to provocation, impulsivity, perspective taking, and sharing. Impulsivity was further assessed through a Go/No-Go paradigm. A computerized emotion recognition task and a staged instrumental help incident were also administered.Boys, regardless of group, responded similarly to high provocation by the fictitious opponent. However, boys in the tryptophan group adjusted their level of responding optimally as a function of the level of provocation, whereas boys in the control group significantly decreased their level of responding towards the end of the competition. Boys in the tryptophan group tended to show greater perspective taking, tended to better distinguish facial expressions of fear and happiness, and tended to provide greater instrumental help to the experimenter.The present study provides initial evidence for the feasibility of acute tryptophan supplementation in children and some effect of tryptophan supplementation on children's behaviors. Further studies are warranted to explore the potential impact of increased serotonergic functioning on boys' dominant and affiliative behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W2091469533,"The promise of modern personalized medicine is to use molecular and clinical information to better diagnose, manage, and treat disease, on an individual patient basis. These functions are predominantly enabled by molecular signatures, which are computational models for predicting phenotypes and other responses of interest from high-throughput assay data. Data-analytics is a central component of molecular signature development and can jeopardize the entire process if conducted incorrectly. While exploratory data analysis may tolerate suboptimal protocols, clinical-grade molecular signatures are subject to vastly stricter requirements. Closing the gap between standards for exploratory versus clinically successful molecular signatures entails a thorough understanding of possible biases in the data analysis phase and developing strategies to avoid them.Using a recently introduced data-analytic protocol as a case study, we provide an in-depth examination of the poorly studied biases of the data-analytic protocols related to signature multiplicity, biomarker redundancy, data preprocessing, and validation of signature reproducibility. The methodology and results presented in this work are aimed at expanding the understanding of these data-analytic biases that affect development of clinically robust molecular signatures.Several recommendations follow from the current study. First, all molecular signatures of a phenotype should be extracted to the extent possible, in order to provide comprehensive and accurate grounds for understanding disease pathogenesis. Second, redundant genes should generally be removed from final signatures to facilitate reproducibility and decrease manufacturing costs. Third, data preprocessing procedures should be designed so as not to bias biomarker selection. Finally, molecular signatures developed and applied on different phenotypes and populations of patients should be treated with great caution."
https://openalex.org/W1977591091,"Nanoindentation techniques recently developed to measure the mechanical response of crystals under external loading conditions reveal new phenomena upon decreasing sample size below the microscale. At small length scales, material resistance to irreversible deformation depends on sample morphology. Here we study the mechanisms of yield and plastic flow in inherently small crystals under uniaxial compression. Discrete structural rearrangements emerge as a series of abrupt discontinuities in stress-strain curves. We obtain the theoretical dependence of the yield stress on system size and geometry and elucidate the statistical properties of plastic deformation at such scales. Our results show that the absence of dislocation storage leads to crucial effects on the statistics of plastic events, ultimately affecting the universal scaling behavior observed at larger scales."
https://openalex.org/W1995291122,"Immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) genes are formed, tested, and modified to yield diverse, specific, and high affinity antibody responses to antigen. The processes involved must be regulated, however, to avoid unintended damage to chromosomes. The 3' regulatory region of the Igh locus plays a major role in regulating class-switch recombination (CSR), the process by which antibody effector functions are modified during an immune response. Loss of all known enhancer-like elements in this region dramatically impairs CSR, but individual element deletions have no effect on this process. In the present study, we explored the hypothesis that an underlying functional redundancy in the homologous elements hs3a and hs3b was masking the importance of either element to CSR. Several transgenic mouse lines were generated, each carrying a bacterial artificial chromosome transgene that mimicked Igh locus structure but in which hs3a was missing and hs3b was flanked by loxP sites. Matings to Cyclization Recombination Enzyme-expressing mice established ""pairs"" of lines that differed only in the presence or absence of hs3b. Remarkably, CSR remained robust in the absence of both hs3a and hs3b, suggesting that the remaining two elements of the 3' regulatory region, hs1.2 and hs4, although individually dispensable for CSR, are, together, sufficient to support CSR."
https://openalex.org/W2088530321,"The regulation of binding of G-actin to cytoplasmic domains of cell surface receptors is a common mechanism to control diverse biological processes. To model the regulation of G-actin binding to a cell surface receptor we used the cell-cell adhesion molecule carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1-S) in which G-actin binds to its short cytoplasmic domain (12 amino acids; Chen, C. J., Kirshner, J., Sherman, M. A., Hu, W., Nguyen, T., and Shively, J. E. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 5749–5760). A liposome model system demonstrates that G-actin binds to the cytosolic domain peptide of CEACAM1-S in the presence of negatively charged palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylserine (POPS) liposomes and Ca2+. In contrast, no binding of G-actin was observed in palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) liposomes or when a key residue in the peptide, Phe-454, is replaced with Ala. Molecular Dynamics simulations on CEACAM1-S in an asymmetric phospholipid bilayer show migration of Ca2+ ions to the lipid leaflet containing POPS and reveal two conformations for Phe-454 explaining the reversible availability of this residue for G-actin binding. NMR transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopic analysis of 13C-labeled Phe-454 CEACAM1-S peptide in liposomes plus actin further confirmed the existence of two peptide conformers and the Ca2+ dependence of actin binding. These findings explain how a receptor with a short cytoplasmic domain can recruit a cytosolic protein in a phospholipid and Ca2+-specific manner. In addition, this model system provides a powerful approach that can be applied to study other membrane protein interactions with their cytosolic targets.

In addition, this model system provides a powerful approach that can be applied to study other membrane protein interactions with their cytosolic targets. Monomeric G-actin is recruited to the plasma membrane in response to a variety of cell receptor activation signals (1Brozinick Jr., J.T. Berkemeier B.A. Elmendorf J.S. Curr. Diabetes Rev. 2007; 3: 111-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 2Scita G. Confalonieri S. Lappalainen P. Suetsugu S.

Although much is known about subsequent steps, including actin polymerization, branching, and participation in functions such as cell motility, less is known about the regulation of the initial G-actin recruitment event. Among the many cell surface receptors that bind G-actin when activated, the so-called “short form” of CEACAM1 3The abbreviations used are: CEACAM1carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule1CEACAM1-Sshort isoform of CEACAM1MDmolecular dynamicsMUAmercaptoundecanoic acidPOPCpalmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholinePOPSpalmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylserineTROSYtransverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy. stands out as a rather simple example in that it is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic domain of only 12 amino acids. When a single amino acid phenylalanine 454 in the cytoplasmic domain is mutated to alanine (F454A), it no longer binds G-actin in in vitro assays, and when transfected into MCF7 cells that form a lumen with wild-type CEACAM1-S, it no longer forms a lumen in three-dimensional culture (5Chen C.J. Kirshner J. Sherman M.A. Hu W. Nguyen T. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5749-5760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Intrigued by the ability of such a short stretch of amino acids to convey G-actin binding in response to the homotypic cell-cell interaction function of CEACAM1, we speculated that the adjacent membrane environment and Ca2+ signaling may play a role in regulating the binding, otherwise binding would be constitutive and irreversible. Given the close proximity of the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 to the lipid bilayer and the inherent asymmetry of the lipid bilayer with respect to charge, we propose that negatively charged phospholipids would attract Ca2+ in response to cell-cell interactions because Ca2+ signaling almost always accompanies cell-cell interactions (6Ko K.S. Arora P.D. Bhide V. Chen A. McCulloch C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1155-1167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Clapham D.E.

Furthermore, Ca2+ recruited to the negatively charged inner leaflet of the plasma membrane would effectively promote the interaction of the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1 with G-actin. To test this hypothesis, we generated an in vitro model of the peptide-actin interaction in the context of negatively charged liposomes in the presence or absence of Ca2+ and analyzed their interactions by a combination of fluorescent bead analysis, NMR TROSY experiment, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and surface plasmon resonance analysis. carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule1 short isoform of CEACAM1 molecular dynamics mercaptoundecanoic acid palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine palmitoyl-oleoyl-phosphatidylserine transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy. Palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylserine (POPS) and palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC) powders (Avanti Polar Lipids) were stored in chloroform at 25 mg/ml. Five μl of stock phospholipid solution in a glass tube was vaporized under argon gas to from a thin and even membrane on the glass tube. Phospholipid was dissolved in 100 μl of PBS, vortexed, and subjected to extrusion through a 200-nm membrane 11–13 times (Avanti Polar Lipids). Glass microspheres (4.5 μm; Bangs Laboratories, Inc.) were cleaned in “piranha solution” (30% H2O2 and concentrated H2SO4 1/4 (v/v) for 3 min at 80 °C, use extreme caution!) followed by extensive washing with water on a clean sintered glass funnel. Clean glass beads were diluted in water (108 beads/μl) and stored at 4 °C. One to 2 μl of suspended glass beads were incubated with 100 μl of liposome at 37 °C for 2 h. Liposome-coated glass beads were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 1 min and washed three times with PBS to remove unbound phospholipid. Glass bead-supported phospholipid membranes were incubated with MUA (mercaptoundecanoic acid)-CEACAM1-S peptide (0.2 mg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C and collected by centrifugation. Peptide-liposome-coated glass beads further incubated with 1% BSA in PBS for 1 h and washed three times using 1% BSA/PBS. G-actin (100 μg/ml) or rhodamine-actin (100 μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 1 mm CaCl2 was incubated with glass beads for 1 h. In the last step, FITC-conjugated anti-actin antibody was incubated with glass beads. Flow cytometry was used to detect the florescence of rhodamine-actin or FITC-conjugated anti-actin antibody on a BD FACS caliber. Single beads were selected for analysis based on forward and side scatter analysis (>80%). Surface plasmon resonance assays were performed on a Biacore T100 (BIAcoreAB) instrument. Liposome or liposome-containing CEACAM1-S MUA-peptide was prepared using the same method as above. The HPA sensor chip (GE Healthcare) was washed with 40 mm β-octylglucoside at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 5 min. Liposomes composed of POPS (2 mg/ml) containing CEACAM1-S MUA-peptide (0.2 mg/ml) in PBS were injected at flow rate of 1 μl/min. Unbound lipid was washed by increasing the flow rate. One percent BSA in PBS was injected to block the sensor chip surface. Actin (0.2 mg/ml) was injected plus or minus 1 mm CaCl2 at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. 0.5 m EDTA (10 μl) was used to regenerate the HPA sensor chip surface. Liposomes without CEACAM1-S MUA-peptide were immobilized to HPA sensor chip and used as a blank. A molecular model of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-S derived previously using homology modeling methods was used in this study (5Chen C.J. Kirshner J. Sherman M.A. Hu W. Nguyen T. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5749-5760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The F454A mutant peptide was generated by using the side chain coordinates of the Cβ of Ala-454 in place of Phe-454. The CEACAM1-S peptide was placed in a simulation box with preequilibrated POPS lipids (courtesy of Peter Tieleman). The center of the peptide and the lipid bilayer were aligned, and the peptide was oriented with its first principal axis perpendicular to the lipid bilayer. To create five different starting conformations the peptide was rotated around its first principal axis by 0, 45, 90, 180, and 270°, respectively. To pack the lipid around the peptide we used the inflategro package in GROMACS (8Kandt C. Ash W.L. Tieleman D.P. Methods. 2007; 41: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). First, the lipid bilayer was expanded by a factor of 4, and lipid molecules within 14 Å of the peptide were removed to avoid clashes between lipid and peptide atoms. To generate an asymmetric lipid bilayer, the POPS lipids of the outer leaflet and 50% of the POPS in the inner leaflet were converted into POPC. Lipids were iteratively packed around the CEACAM1-S peptide by shrinking the bilayer area by 5% using the inflategro package in GROMACS, with steepest descent energy minimization, using position restraints to prevent the peptide from moving, performed after every iteration. This procedure was repeated until an area per lipid close to the experimental value of 65.8 A2 (9Tieleman D.P. Forrest L.R. Sansom M.S. Berendsen H.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17554-17561Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) was reached. Single-point charge water molecules (10Berendsen H.J. Postma J.P. van Gunsteren W.F. Hermans J. Pullman B. Intermolecular Forces. Reidel, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1981: 331-342Google Scholar) were added on both sides of the lipid bilayer, and an appropriate number of sodium ions were added in the water to neutralize the system. For each of the five conformations we also generated a system with 2 additional Ca2+ ions that were neutralized by 4 Cl− ions. All ions were added by displacing random water molecules using the genion command in GROMACS. The final systems were minimized by steepest descent energy minimization with a maximum force of 1000 kJ/mol per nm as convergence criterion. MD simulations on CEACAM1-S in a lipid bilayer consisting of POPS and POPC were performed using GROMACS 4.0.5 (11Van Der Spoel D. Lindahl E. Hess B. Groenhof G. Mark A.E. Berendsen H.J. J. Comput. Chem. 2005; 26: 1701-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (11220) Google Scholar) and the GROMOS96 53a6 forcefield (12Oostenbrink C. Villa A. Mark A.E. van Gunsteren W.F. J. Comput.

J. 1997; 72: 2002-2013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar). Short range nonbonded interactions were truncated at 1.2 nm, with the neighbor list updated every 10 fs. To account for the cutoff in the van der Waals interactions, long range dispersion correction was applied to energy and pressure terms. Long range electrostatics were calculated using the smooth particle mesh Ewald method (14Essmann U. Perera L. Berkowitz M.L. Darden T. Lee H. Pedersen L.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1995; 103: 8577-8593Crossref Scopus (15597) Google Scholar). Bonds were constrained using the LINCS algorithm (15Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J. Fraaije J.G. J. Comput. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11559) Google Scholar) to allow for a time step of 2 fs. For continuity, periodic boundary conditions were applied in every dimension. MD simulations were performed on five starting conformations of CEACAM1-S in lipid without Ca2+ ions and five conformations of CEACAM1-S in lipid with Ca2+ ions. Each system was equilibrated by performing 100 ps of MD at 310 K using a NVT ensemble followed by 5 ns of MD under NPT conditions with a pressure of 1 bar. The velocity-rescaling thermostat (16Bussi G. Donadio D. Parrinello M. J. Chem. Phys. 2007; 126 (014101)Crossref PubMed Scopus (9103) Google Scholar) was used for temperature coupling during the equilibration and a Parrinello-Rahman barostat (17Parrinello M. Rahman A. J. Appl. Phys. 1981; 52: 7182-7190Crossref Scopus (11540) Google Scholar, 18Nosé S. Klein M.L. Mol. Phys. 1983; 50: 1055-1076Crossref Scopus (2213) Google Scholar) for pressure coupling. The CEACAM1 peptide was kept in place during these equilibration steps using position restraints of 1000 kJ/mol per nm2. After the systems were equilibrated at the correct temperature and pressure, MD simulations of 100 ns were performed for each of the 10 conformations, using a NVT ensemble with a Nosé-Hoover thermostat (19Nose S. J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 511-519Crossref Scopus (12533) Google Scholar). Simulations on the F454A mutant were performed over 40–100 ns for a total of ∼600 ns. Data were not collected for the first 5 ns of each simulation. The interatomic distances between the Cα, Cβ, and Cγ atoms of the CEACAM1-S peptide were extracted every 10 ps from the MD trajectories. The first 5 ns of each trajectory was left out to avoid not well equilibrated conformations. The distances of all simulations were combined into one distance matrix for clustering analysis, leading to a total of 9510 sampled conformations with each conformation expressed as 4950 interatomic distances. The distance matrix was grouped into two clusters using a K-Means clustering algorithm. The process was repeated 10 times to verify that the clusters were reproducible; grouping into three clusters was attempted but was not reproducible. Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)-Phe-OH-13C9, 15N 98 atom % 13C, 98 atom % 15N was purchased from ISOTEC. C18 Sep-Pak cartridges were purchased from Waters (Ireland). POPS (porcine brain) and POPC (chicken egg) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Nonmuscle actin (99% pure) was purchased from Cytoskeleton. To remove the residual TFA from the synthesized peptide, a C18 cartridge was conditioned using 70% acetonitrile solution followed by 1% acetic acid wash. After the peptide solution was loaded onto the cartridge, the column was washed using 1% acetic acid, then eluted with 70% acetonitrile-water. Samples were lyophilized and stored at −80 °C. The peptide concentration was determined using an NMR method (20Wider G. Dreier L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 2571-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Bulk solutions of POPS and POPC were prepared by dissolving 100 mg of each lipid in 4 ml of chloroform, flushed with argon, and stored at −20 °C. For POPS or POPC liposomes, 288 or 268 μl of bulk solution was transferred to a 1.5-ml polypropylene tube, and the solvent was evaporated under argon and further dried overnight under vacuum. To the dry lipid film, 400 μl of 50 mm phosphate buffer (90% D2O, pH 7.0) and 1.5 μl of 166 mm EDTA solution were added, vortexed, and sonicated for 30 min or until the lipid solution became transparent. The 400-μl liposome solution was then mixed with 100 μl of 0.5 mm MUA-13C, 15N-Phe-CEACAM1-S peptide in 50 mm phosphate buffer (90% D2O, pH 7.0), and 1 mm tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine. The sample was then transferred to the NMR tube and flushed with argon gas. For the study of the complex with actin, 460 μl of the MUA-CEACAM1-S peptide-liposome solution was added to 2 mg of actin powder. After vigorous vortexing, the solution was transferred to an argon-flushed Shigemi NMR tube. For the sample in the presence of Ca2+, the Ca2+ was added after the addition of actin at a final Ca2+ concentration of 5 mm. For the mixed POPS/POPC liposome system, 144 μl of POPS and 134 μl of POPC were taken from the bulk POPS and POPC solution, respectively, and the two lipids were mixed well before evaporating the solvent. We used 13C-labeled Phe in the CEACAM1-S peptide as a probe because the chemical shifts of the aromatic ring are well separated from signals of the lipid. Because the CEACAM1-S peptide is inserted into the liposome through the MUA-aliphatic group, there is significant line broadening of the NMR signal from 13C-labeled Phe aromatic ring. For 0.1 mm concentration of peptide, the peptide signal is very weak from constant-time 13C-1H heteronuclear single-quantum coherence experiment (21Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Magn.

J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6394-6400Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The experiments were carried out at 35 °C on a 600-MHz Bruker instrument equipped with a cryoprobe. The constant time duration, spectrum width, and total number of free induction decays for the 13C dimension are 17.6 ms, 4 ppm, and 20, respectively. For the 1H dimension, the total number of points and spectrum width are 2048 and 14 ppm, respectively. The recycle delay is 1.2 s. The experimental time is about 18 h with the number of scans ranging from 2200 to 2560. The TROSY data were processed using the NMRPipe software (23Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G.

CEACAM1 has two cytoplasmic domain isoforms, of which the short isoform (CEACAM1-S) is sufficient to induce lumen formation when expressed in the breast cancer cell line MCF7 and grown in three-dimensional culture (Fig. 1A). When CEACAM1-S is expressed in cells that undergo cell-cell contact, CEACAM1-S migrates to the cell-cell contact region along with F-actin (Fig. 1B). Although we have shown that the initial interaction of the short cytoplasmic domain is with G-actin (5Chen C.J. Kirshner J. Sherman M.A. Hu W. Nguyen T. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5749-5760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), the small size of this domain and its close proximity to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane prompted us to investigate the role of the microenvironment in its interaction with G-actin in a model system. The model comprises a phospholipid bilayer coated onto 4.5-μm glass beads into which is inserted an MUA version of the 12-amino cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-S (Fig. 2, A and B). The MUA-peptide spontaneously inserts into the lipid bilayer in a saturable manner that can be quantitated by fluorescently tagged anti-peptide antibodies using flow cytomtery (Fig. 2C). The liposome-glass bead displayed peptide is then incubated with either G-actin (detected by anti-actin antibody plus fluorescent-tagged secondary antibody) or rhodamine-actin in the presence or absence of Ca2+. Two phospholipid environments were analyzed: POPS, an abundant negatively charged phospholipid on the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, and POPC, the most abundant neutral phospholipid on the outer leaflet. As shown on Fig. 3A, G-actin binds to the peptide only in POPS with Ca2+, but not in POPC with or without Ca2+ (Fig. 3B). To test the validity of this model system further, we repeated the experiment with two mutated versions of the peptide, the F454A mutation, which abrogates in vitro binding to G-actin and in vivo lumen formation, and the K456A mutation, which enhances G-actin binding (5Chen C.J. Kirshner J. Sherman M.A. Hu W. Nguyen T. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 5749-5760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous studies, the F454A mutation abrogated actin binding (Fig. 4A), and the K456A mutation enhanced actin binding (Fig. 4B). These results not only confirm our previous findings but also suggest that both the lipid and Ca2+ environment enable the interaction, thus providing a context for the regulation of the interaction. They also show that these liposomes can be used to query the interaction of a transmembrane protein interacting with intracellular proteins.FIGURE 2Generation of lipid-embedded cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-S. The cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1-S has 12 amino acids that when synthesized with an N-acyl-MUA (A) spontaneously inserts into 4.5-μm glass beads coated with POPS or POPC liposomes used in actin binding experiments (B) and can be quantitated with fluorescent-tagged anti-peptide antibodies (mean fluorescence intensity versus concentration of peptide, C).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3G-actin binds to CEACAM1-S peptide in POPS liposome coated glass beads in a Ca2+-specific manner.

To reduce bias caused by the choice of an initial conformation we have initiated simulations from five unique starting conformations. Each initial conformation was simulated for 100 ns with and without the addition of 2 Ca2+ ions (simulation box size, 7 × 7 × 10 nm). During all five of the MD simulations with Ca2+ we observed a migration of Ca2+ ions to the POPS lipid head groups, where they may mediate the interaction between CEACAM1-S and actin. K-Means clustering of the CEACAM1-S conformation over all MD trajectories revealed two distinct conformational clusters (supplemental Fig. S1). The conformations in the distinct clusters differ in the orientation of the cytoplasmic domain from Phe-454 onward with respect to the transmembrane domain (supplemental Fig. S1). The structure of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains by themselves is invariant between the clusters, thus suggesting that Phe-454 and its surrounding residues may serve as a hinge around which a conformational change occurs. The two different clusters exhibit differences in the orientation of Phe-454 (Fig. 5, A–C). In one conformation Phe-454 is pointing outward into the solvent, whereas in the other conformation Phe-454 is parallel to the lipid bilayer and buried by the surrounding lipid molecules. In the conformations where Phe-454 is buried by the surrounding lipids we observed a cation-π interaction (25Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (2351) Google Scholar) between Phe-454 and Lys-456 (Fig. 6). This interaction is especially favored when Phe-454 is buried in the lipid bilayer. In the solvent-exposed conformations the dehydration of the amine ion of Lys-456 causes the cation-π interaction to be unfavorable and hence broken (26Kumpf R.A. Dougherty D.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1708-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The observed cation-π interaction between Phe-454 and Lys-456 may be one of the mechanisms by which Lys-456 inhibits actin binding. As expected, the mutation K456A relieves this inhibition (Fig. 4B). Simulations were also performed for the F454A mutant embedded in the lipid bilayer. The peptide conformations from these simulations clustered into a single conformation resembling the conformation of Phe-454 that points into solvent (supplemental Fig. S2). This shows that Phe-454 is required for CEACAM1-S to exist in two different conformations.FIGURE 6Cation-π interaction observed between Phe-454 and Lys-456 only when Phe-454 is in the lipid head groups. The distributions of Cγ–Cγ distances between Phe-454 and Lys-456 sampled during MD are shown. A, when Phe-454 is solvent-exposed (blue conformation) there is only one peak in the distribution observed at ∼9.5 Å, indicating that there is no interaction between Phe-454 and Lys-456. B, when Phe-454 is in the lipid head groups (red conformation) an additional peak in the distribution is observed at ∼5.2 Å, indicating an interaction between Phe-454 and Lys-456.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Individual simulations show no transitions from one conformational cluster to the other cluster (supplemental Fig. S1), and therefore it is speculative to discern whether addition of Ca2+ causes one cluster to be favored over the other. NMR TROSY experiments were conducted to assess which of the two conformations is favored for actin binding and whether Ca2+ ions have an effect on the balance between the two conformations. The conformation of Phe-454 in a POPS liposome environment was assessed directly by synthesis of the N-acyl-MUA peptide with 13C-labeled Phe and analysis by NMR TROSY. This approach allowed a clean separation of the aromatic signals of Phe-454 from the abundant phospholipid signals and had sufficient sensitivity to allow quantitation of peak volumes despite the peak broadening due to insertion of the peptide in liposomes. Two different environments (further supported in supplemental Fig. S3) were observed for Phe-454. Each environment has a distinct set of two cross-peaks (Fig. 5, D–F). Although three expected peaks were observed from free peptide in the absence of liposome (data not shown), it is clear that the lipid environment perturbs the pattern of cross-peaks, increasing the signal line width significantly, reducing the number of cross-peaks from three to two (for possible explanations, see supplemental NMR Discussion). The addition of actin caused a decrease in the overall intensity of the peaks as well as a change in the ratio between the peaks (Fig. 5E and Table 1). The decrease in peak intensity can be interpreted as binding of actin to one of the conformers which, due to an increase in molecular size, causes increased line broadening so that the signal becomes NMR invisible, the so-called “dark” state (27Fawzi N.L. Ying J. Torchia D.A. Clore G.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 9948-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The shift in ratio between the two conformations could indicate that one conformation is preferred by actin. When Ca2+ is added, the total peak intensities are further decreased by 44% (Fig. 5F and Table 1), and the shift in ratios is increased, emphasizing a role for Ca2+ in enhancing the binding of CEACAM1-S to actin.TABLE 1NMR peak volumes of 13C-Phe-CEACAM1-S peptide in POPS liposomePeakaPeak symbols (C1-a/b and C2-a/b) are shown in Fig. 5.VpepbVpep is the peak volume measured from the free CEACAM1-S peptide in the liposome.Vpep_actcVpep_act is the peak volume measured from the complex of CEACAM1-S and actin.(Vpep_act − Vpep)/VpepVpep_act_Ca2+dVpep_act_Ca2+ is the peak volume measured from the complex of CEACAM1-S and actin in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+.(Vpep_act_Ca2+ − Vpep)/VpepC1-a1,006684−32%396−61%C1-b2,4081,732−28%857−64%C2-a147301105%23661%C2-b153326113%22346%Total3,7143"
https://openalex.org/W2035083524,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase (APR) catalyzes the first committed step in sulfate reduction for the biosynthesis of cysteine and is essential for survival in the latent phase of tuberculosis infection. The reaction catalyzed by APR involves the nucleophilic attack by conserved Cys-249 on adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate, resulting in a covalent S-sulfocysteine intermediate that is reduced in subsequent steps by thioredoxin to yield the sulfite product. Cys-249 resides on a mobile active site lid at the C terminus, within a K(R/T)ECG(L/I)H motif. Owing to its strict conservation among sulfonucleotide reductases and its proximity to the active site cysteine, it has been suggested that His-252 plays a key role in APR catalysis, specifically as a general base to deprotonate Cys-249. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we have changed His-252 to an alanine residue and analyzed the effect of this mutation on the kinetic parameters, pH rate profile, and ionization of Cys-249 of APR. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that His-252 does not perturb the pK(a) of Cys-249 or play a direct role in rate-limiting chemical steps of the reaction. Rather, we show that His-252 enhances substrate affinity via interaction with the α-phosphate and the endocyclic ribose oxygen. These findings were further supported by isothermal titration calorimetry to provide a thermodynamic profile of ligand-protein interactions. From an applied standpoint, our study suggests that small-molecules targeting residues in the dynamic C-terminal segment, particularly His-252, may lead to inhibitors with improved binding affinity."
https://openalex.org/W2068805767,"Networks are widely used in biology to represent the relationships between genes and gene functions. In Boolean biological models, it is mainly assumed that there are two states to represent a gene: on-state and off-state. It is typically assumed that the relationship between two genes can be characterized by two kinds of pairwise relationships: similarity and prerequisite. Many approaches have been proposed in the literature to reconstruct biological relationships. In this article, we propose a two-step method to reconstruct the biological pathway when the binary array data have measurement error. For a pair of genes in a sample, the first step of this approach is to assign counting numbers for every relationship and select the relationship with counting number greater than a threshold. The second step is to calculate the asymptotic p-values for hypotheses of possible relationships and select relationships with a large p-value. This new method has the advantages of easy calculation for the counting numbers and simple closed forms for the p-value. The simulation study and real data example show that the two-step counting method can accurately reconstruct the biological pathway and outperform the existing methods. Compared with the other existing methods, this two-step method can provide a more accurate and efficient alternative approach for reconstructing the biological network."
