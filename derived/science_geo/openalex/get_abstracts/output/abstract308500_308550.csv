https://openalex.org/W1989480622,"A strong interaction between the solar wind and comet Giacobini-Zinner was observed oh 11 September 1985 with the Los Alamos plasma electron experiment on the International Cometary Explorer (ICE) spacecraft. As ICE approached an intercept point 7800 kilometers behind the nucleus from the south and receded to the north, upstream phenomena due to the comet were observed. Periods of enhanced electron heat flux from the comet as well as almost continuous electron density fluctuations were measured. These effects are related to the strong electron heating observed in the cometary interaction region and to cometary ion pickup by the solar wind, respectively. No evidence for a conventional bow shock was found as ICE entered and exited the regions of strongest interaction of the solar wind with the cometary environment. The outer extent of this strong interaction zone was a transition region in which the solar wind plasma was heated, compressed, and slowed. Inside the inner boundary of the transition region was a sheath that enclosed a cold intermediate coma. In the transition region and sheath, small-scale enhancements in density were observed. These density spikes may be due to an instability associated with cometary ion pickup or to the passage of ICE through cometary ray structures. In the center of the cold intermediate coma a narrow, high-density core of plasma, presumably the developing plasma tail was found. In some ways this tail can be compared to the plasma sheet in Earth's magnetotail and to the current sheet in the tail at Venus. This type of configuration is expected in the double-lobe magnetic topology detected at the comet, possibly caused by the theoretically expected draping of the interplanetary magnetic field around its ionosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2082918303,"The vector helium magnetometer on the International Cometary Explorer observed the magnetic fields induced by the interaction of comet Giacobini-Zinner with the solar wind. A magnetic tail was penetrated approximately 7800 kilometers downstream from the comet and was found to be 10(4) kilometers wide. It consisted of two lobes, containing oppositely directed fields with strengths up to 60 nanoteslas, separated by a plasma sheet approximately 10(3)kilometers thick containing a thin current sheet. The magnetotail was enclosed in an extended ionosheath characterized by intense hydromagnetic turbulene and interplanetary fields draped around the comet. A distant bow wave, which may or may not have been a bow shock, was observed at both edges of the ionosheath. Weak turbulence was observed well upstream of the bow wave."
https://openalex.org/W2087444779,"The plasma wave instrument on the International Cometary Explorer (ICE) detected bursts of strong ion acoustic waves almost continuously when the spacecraft was within 2 million kilometers of the nucleus of comet Giacobini-Zinner. Electromagnetic whistlers and low-level electron plasma oscillations were also observed in this vast region that appears to be associated with heavy ion pickup. As ICE came closer to the anticipated location of the bow shock, the electromagnetic and electrostatic wave levels increased significantly, but even in the midst of this turbulence the wave instrument detected structures with familiar bow shock characteristics that were well correlated with observations of localized electron heating phenomena. Just beyond the visible coma, broadband waves with amplitudes as high as any ever detected by the ICE plasma wave instrument were recorded. These waves may account for the significant electron heating observed in this region by the ICE plasma probe, and these observations of strong wave-particle interactions may provide answers to longstanding questions concerning ionization processes in the vicinity of the coma. Near closest approach, the plasma wave instrument detected broadband electrostatic noise and a changing pattern of weak electron plasma oscillations that yielded a density profile for the outer layers of the cold plasma tail. Near the tail axis the plasma wave instrument also detected a nonuniform flux of dust impacts, and a preliminary profile of the Giacobini-Zinner dust distribution for micrometer-sized particles is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1986900180,"During the encounter with comet Giacobini-Zinner, the energetic particle anisotropy spectrometer on the International Cometary Explorer spacecraft observed large fluxes of energetic ions, believed to result principally from ionization of the cometary atmosphere followed by pickup and acceleration by the ambient flow of the solar wind. These heavy cometary ions were observed from approximately 1 day before closest approach to about 2(1/2) days afterward. Three regimes of differing ion characteristics have been identified. An outer region with a scale of approximately 10(6) kilometers contains variable fluxes of antisolar-streaming pick-up ions in the undisturbed solar wind. In the middle region, of approximately 10(5) kilometers, fluxes have less large-scale variability and broader angular and energy distributions. This region is separated from the outer zone by a sharp transition. The inner region has a scale of approximately 10(4) kilometers and is characterized by reduced fluxes and complex angular distributions."
https://openalex.org/W2054487647,"Conclusive evidence is presented for the existence of energetic ( approximately 535,0000 to 150,000 electron volts), heavy (>-12 atomic mass units), singly charged cometary ions within approximately 1.5 x 10(6) kilometers of comet Giacobini-Zinner. The observations were made with the University of Maryland/Max-Planck-Institut ultralow-energy charge analyzer on, the International Cometary Explorer spacecraft. The most direct evidence for establishing the mass of these ions was obtained from an analysis of the energy signals in one of the solid-state detectors; it is significant at the three-sigma level. Maximum fluxes were recorded approximately 1 hour before and approximately 1 hour after closest approach to the cometary nucleus. Transformation of the particle angular distributions observed at approximately 50,000 kilometers radial distance from the comet during the inbound pass into a rest frame in which the distributions are nearly isotropic requires a transformation velocity that is consistent with the local solar wind velocity if one assumes that these particles are primarily singly ionized with a mass of 18 +/- 6 atomic mass units. The existence of a frame of reference in which these water-group ions were isotropic implies that they underwent strong pitch angle scattering after their ionization. Particle energies in the rest frame extend to substantially higher values than would be expected if these ions were locally ionized and then picked up by the solar wind, implying that the ions were accelerated or heated. The derived ion density, approximately 0.1 per cubic centimeter, is consistent with a crude model for the production and transport of pickup ions."
https://openalex.org/W1971522316,"Monolayers of rare gas atoms adsorbed onto the basal planes of graphite play the same prototype role in two dimensions that rare gas liquids and solids do in three dimensions. In recent experiments such novel phenomena as continuous melting, the lack of true crystallinity in two dimensions, orientationally ordered fluid phases, and melting from a solid to a reentrant fluid with decreasing temperature have been observed. Because the forces in these rare gas monolayers are simple and well understood, by studying them the investigator can examine a direct interface between experiment and first principles. In order to understand the phases and phase transitions that occur in such materials, it is necessary to consider the geometrical matching of the rare gas overlayer to the graphite substrate. It turns out that in two dimensions both the local and the long-distance behavior are important. These two-dimensional rare gas solids may be effectively probed with synchrotron x-ray techniques, and the results of a series of synchrotron x-ray scattering studies of these solids are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2004610166,"Thermal noise spectroscopy was used to measure the density and temperature of the main (cold) electron plasma population during 2 hours (1.5 × 105 kilometers perpendicular to the tail axis) around the point of closest approach of the International Cometary Explorer (ICE) to comet Giacobini-Zinner. The time resolution was 18 seconds (370 kilometers) in the plasma tail and 54 seconds (1100 kilometers) elsewhere. Near the tail axis, the maximum plasma density was 670 per cubic centimeter and the temperature slightly above 1 electron volt. Away from the axis, the plasma density dropped to 100 per cubic centimeter (temperature, 2 × 104 K) over 2000 kilometers, then decreased to 10 (1.5 × 105 K) over 15,000 kilometers; outside that region (plasma tail), the density fluctuated between 10 and 30 per cubic centimeter and the temperature between 1 × 105 and 4 × 105 K. The relative density of the hot population rarely exceeded a few percent. The tail was highly asymmetrical and showed much structure. On the other antenna, shot noise was recorded from the plasma particle impacts on the spacecraft body. No evidence was found of grain impacts on the antennas or spacecraft in the plasma tail. This yields an upper limit for the dust flux or particle mass, indicating either fluxes or masses in the tail smaller than implied by the models or an anomalous grain structure. This seems to support earlier suggestions that these grains are featherlike. Outside the tail, and particularly near 105 kilometers from its axis, impulsive noises indicating plasma turbulence were observed."
https://openalex.org/W2041600486,"The International Cometary Explorer (ICE) became the first spacecraft ever to encounter a comet when it passed through the tail of comet Giacobini-Zinner. An overview of this encounter is presented, including highlights of the results."
https://openalex.org/W1964459853,"The International Cometary Explorer spacecraft passed through the coma of comet Giacobini-Zinner about 7800 kilometers antisunward of the nucleus on 11 September 1985. The ion composition instrument was sensitive to ambient ions with mass-to-charge ratios in the ranges 1.4 to 3 atomic mass units per electron charge (amu e-1) and 14 to 33 amu e-1. Initial interpretation of the measurements indicates the presence of H2O+, H3O+, probably CO+ and HCO+, and ions in the mass range 23 to 24; possible candidates are Na+ and Mg+. In addition to these heavy ions, measured over the velocity range 80 to 223 kilometers per second, the instrument measured He2+ of solar wind origin over the range 237 to 463 kilometers per second. The heavy ions have a velocity distribution which indicates that they have been picked up by the motional electric field, whereas the light ions are steadily decelerated as the comet tail axis is approached. These results are in agreement with the picture of a comet primarily consisting of water ice, together with other material, that sublimes, streams away from the nucleus, becomes ionized, and interacts with the solar wind."
https://openalex.org/W1646075322,"A national park is as integral to its regional environment as it is to the nation. Whether one wants to manage it that way or not, a park is dependent on the resources-human and physiobiological-of the environs, just as the environs are modified by the park's existence. This view may not jibe with the spirit of those who strive to protect a patch of old-time Africa as a refuge of serenity and stability in a world of tumult and change. But the park has its own ecology, just as does any creature within it, although the park's, being more abstract, is more difficult to discern. Planned or not, a park's future is even more enmeshed with the region's future than with the nation's. The ramifications of this relationship, especially the socioeconomic ones, are not always recognized, with the result that the enmeshing process sometimes sounds like a crunching of the gears. The worlds on both sides of the park boundary would get along better if there were a clear indication of what each can do for the other. By contrast, if they spend their energy resisting one another, there is little doubt as to which must be the ultimate ""winner."""

Organisms that encrust the reef cavities are preferentially preserved as the framework is bored. Burial by loose sediment stops framework growth, encrustation, and boring. Finally, cementation completes fossilization."

https://openalex.org/W2117706023,"Baldwin (1) has summarized some of the evidence for the early and present internal thermal states of the moon. He argued that the interior of the moon, below about 200 to 300 kilometers, is presently hot, that is, has interior temperatures close to or exceeding the lunar solidus curve. The evidence for a rapid differentiation of the moon about 4.6 X 10^9 on years ago, the extensive igneous episode resulting in mare formation 3.7 X 10^9 to 2.8 X 10^9 years ago, the depletion of the moon in volatiles and its enrichment in calcium, aluminum, and the trace refractory elements all argue for a hot origin and high initial temperatures. A straightforward consequence of the lunar thermal inertia is that if the interior of the moon were ever hot it would remain hot to the present. The high surface concentrations of uranium, thorium, and potassium, and the Apollo 15 heat flow value of 33 ergs per square centimeter per second (2), indicate high present-day temperatures in the lunar interior (3)."

As a consequence, the neutron diffraction technique must be reevaluated as a possible primary tool for crystal structure determination."
https://openalex.org/W2004238598,"The vulnerability military space systems depends on their orbits, functions, and other characteristics. The high-altitude satellites needed for warning and communications in particular could be vulnerable to prompt destruction by certain space-based systems and, in the future, possibly by ground-based high power lasers. A combination of passive countermeasures and arms control agreements could give these satellites some protection against such attack. Deployment of strategic defensive systems with the capability to reach far into space would invalidate this approach."
