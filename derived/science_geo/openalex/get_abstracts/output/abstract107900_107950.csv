https://openalex.org/W1607041879,"The binding of purified fibrinogen receptor alpha IIb beta 3, vitronectin receptor alpha V beta 3, and fibronectin receptor alpha 5 beta 1 to their corresponding ligands in solid-phase binding assays was used to examine the inhibitory activity of various linear and cyclic penta- and hexapeptides of different conformation containing RGD or RAD sequences. Cyclic peptides with different defined backbone conformations were designed by introducing a single D-amino acid or a proline at different positions in the ring. The data were calibrated for alpha IIb beta 3 integrin incorporated into a planar lipid bilayer by a physical method (total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy) which yielded KD = 1.7 microM for a linear RGD peptide and KD = 0.03 microM for fibrinogen. With this integrin, three cyclic hexapeptides ([GRGDFL], [ARGDFV], [GRGDFV]) were 2-4-fold more inhibitory than the linear GRGDS peptide in solid-phase assays and showed similar inhibition as the fibrinogen ligand. Six peptides had the same or a 2-fold lower activity as the linear reference peptide, and three peptides were up to 7-fold less active. Replacement of Arg or Asp by their stereoisomers or Gly by Ala resulted in a 100-1000-fold reduction in activity. With the two other integrins, a single cyclic pentapeptide [RGDFV] was 10-fold more active (alpha V beta 3) or equal in activity (alpha 5 beta 1) to linear GRGDS, while all of the other cyclic peptides were moderately or distinctly less active. Changes in the RGD sequence caused a less dramatic reduction in binding strength for alpha V beta 3 and alpha 5 beta 1 than for alpha II beta 3. Inhibitory activity was compared with the distance between the C beta atoms of Arg and Asp residues as determined by NMR and indicated that the optimum distance is in the range of 0.75-0.85 nm for alpha IIb beta 3 and at or below 0.67 nm for alpha V beta 3 and alpha 5 beta 1. This indicates that alpha IIb beta 3 less sensitive to variations in the RGD backbone structure and can accommodate a larger distance than the integrins alpha V beta 3 and alpha 5 beta 1."
https://openalex.org/W1644991946,"Myeloperoxidase, a heme protein secreted by activated phagocytes, is expressed in human atherosclerotic lesions. The enzyme uses H2O2 generated by the cells to oxidize L-tyrosine to tyrosyl radical, a catalyst for protein dityrosine synthesis. We have explored the possibility that tyrosyl radical initiates lipid peroxidation, which may be of pivotal importance in transforming low density lipoprotein (LDL) into atherogenic particles. Exposure of LDL to L-tyrosine and activated human neutrophils caused peroxidation of LDL lipids. LDL oxidation required L-tyrosine but was independent of free metal ions; catalase and heme poisons were inhibitory. Incubation of LDL with L-tyrosine, myeloperoxidase, and H2O2 likewise caused lipid peroxidation, and this reaction was inhibited by heme poisons and catalase. Replacement of L-tyrosine with O-methyltyrosine, which cannot form tyrosyl radical, inhibited LDL oxidation by both activated neutrophils and myeloperoxidase. The antioxidants ascorbate and probucol, but not vitamin E, inhibited LDL oxidation by myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and L-tyrosine. Ascorbate blocked dityrosine synthesis, while probucol scavenged chain-propagating peroxyl radicals in the lipid phase of LDL. These results indicate that tyrosyl radical stimulates LDL lipid peroxidation. In striking contrast to other cell-mediated mechanisms for LDL oxidation, the myeloperoxidase-catalyzed reaction is independent of free metal ions. This raises the possibility that tyrosyl radical generated by myeloperoxidase is of physiological importance in making LDL atherogenic."
https://openalex.org/W1501535278,"NF-Y is a highly conserved heteromeric CCAAT-binding transcription factor involved in the function of several promoters. The NF-YA subunit contains a domain of high homology to yeast HAP2, which we show to be necessary and sufficient to mediate interactions with the NF-YB subunit and with DNA. Using protein affinity columns derivatized with amino acid substitution mutants, we further dissect this region into two functionally separable subdomains. The subunit association function resides in a 21-amino acid stretch, which is almost perfectly conserved among different species, while interaction with DNA resides in another short segment. We also show that DNA-binding mutants act as dominant repressors of NF-Y-DNA complex formation and of NF-Y-dependent transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1585778217,"The mu opiate receptor is a principal brain site for activities of morphine, other opiate drugs, and opioid peptides in modulating pain and altering mood. Recent cloning of cDNAs encoding rat and human mu receptors reveals charged amino acid residues within putative transmembrane domains (TMs) II, III, and VI, a substantial N-terminal extracellular domain, and a C-terminal intracellular domain. Deletion of 64 N-terminal amino acids produced little effect on receptor function (Wang, J.B., Imai, Y., Eppler, C.M., Gregor, P., Spivak, C.E., and Uhl, G.R. (1993) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 90, 10230-10234). Further deletion of 33 C-terminal amino acids yielded a receptor at which morphine, but not the substituted enkephalin DAMGO ([D-Ala2,MePhe4,Glyol5]enkephalin), inhibited adenylate cyclase. Alanine substitution for each charged TM residue in the N-terminally deleted receptor reduced affinities for morphine, DAMGO, and the opiate antagonist naloxone. Replacement of TM II Asp114 with asparagine or glutamic acid increased mu receptor affinity for naloxone. TM II and TM III glutamic acid substitutions for Asp114 and Asp147 reduced agonist binding affinities but allowed full inhibition of adenylate cyclase at high agonist concentrations. TM VI histidine substitution with alanine yielded a receptor that produced almost twice the cyclase inhibition displayed by the wild type receptor in parallel transient expression assays. These findings underscore the importance of charged residues in TM II, III, and VI for different receptor functions and the modest involvement of extensive portions of N- and C-terminal receptor domains in these processes."
https://openalex.org/W1594921148,"Conversion of active GTP-bound Ras to its inactive GDP-bound form is catalyzed by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Two mammalian Ras-specific GAPs, p120GAP and neurofibromin, the product of the NF1 tumor suppressor gene, have been previously described. We report here the identification of a new human cDNA clone, IQGAP1, which predicts a 1657-amino acid protein that displays extensive sequence similarity to the catalytic domain of all previously reported RasGAPs. IQGAP1 is most closely related to the Schizosaccharomyces pombe RasGAP-like protein, Sar1. Sequence similarity to IQGAP1 is seen throughout the entire Sar1 protein. The N-terminal half of IQGAP1, which does not overlap with Sar1, contains six copies of a unique amino acid motif, as well as four so-called IQ motifs. The latter motifs are found in several proteins, including conventional and unconventional myosins, and mediate the interaction with calmodulin and calmodulin-related proteins. Thus, IQGAP1 appears to represent a novel RasGAP-like protein that may link Ras signaling to some calmodulin-mediated process."
https://openalex.org/W1544756101,"Similarly to other serotypes, botulinum neurotoxin serotype G (BoNT/G) contains the zinc binding motif of zinc endopeptidases. Highly purified preparations of BoNT/G show a zinc-dependent protease activity specific for VAMP/synaptobrevin, a membrane protein of synaptic vesicles. The two neuronal VAMP isoforms are cleaved with similar rates at one Ala-Ala peptide bond present in the same region, out of the several such peptide bonds present in their sequences. This site of cleavage is unique among the eight clostridial neurotoxins. VAMP proteolysis is displayed only after reduction of the single interchain disulfide bond present in the toxin, and it is inhibited by EDTA, o-phenanthroline and captopril."
https://openalex.org/W1646327013,"Type VII collagen is the major, if not the exclusive, component of the anchoring fibrils, attachment structures at the dermal-epidermal basement membrane zone. In this study, we have isolated overlapping cDNA clones which correspond to full-length human type VII collagen mRNA of approximately 9.2 kilobases. The full-length cDNA sequence contains an 8,833 nucleotide open reading frame encoding 2,944 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence revealed the presence of a central collagenous domain flanked by a large NH2-terminal non-collagenous (NC-1) domain which consists of submodules with homology to known adhesive proteins, including nine fibronectin type III-like segments (FNIII), and a smaller COOH-terminal non-collagenous (NC-2) domain. In addition, we report six intragenic polymorphisms in the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1) which can be detected by restriction enzyme digestion of polymerase chain reaction-amplified segments. The complete cDNA sequence and polymorphisms in COL7A1 will facilitate mutational analysis and prenatal diagnosis for patients with the dystrophic forms of epidermolysis bullosa, in which mutations in COL7A1 have been demonstrated."
https://openalex.org/W1487243261,"Phosphatidylcholine-hydrolyzing phospholipase D (PLD; EC 3.1.4.4) has been proposed to play an important role in the signal transduction pathways in animals and in various cellular processes in plants. To unravel the structure of PLD and further the investigation of its modes of regulation and cellular function, we have isolated a PLD cDNA from castor bean (Ricinus communis L. var. Hale) by using oligonucleotide probes based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified PLD protein. The nucleotide sequence of the castor bean PLD cDNA clone contains an open reading frame of 2424 bases encoding an 808-amino acid protein of 92,400 daltons. Expression of this PLD cDNA clone in Escherichia coli resulted in the accumulation of a functional PLD able to catalyze hydrolysis and transphosphatidylation reactions, demonstrating that the introduction of this single gene product was sufficient to confer PLD activity and that both the hydrolysis and transphosphatidylation reactions are catalyzed the single PLD protein. Comparison of the deduced protein sequence of the clone to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified PLD revealed that the mature PLD protein is preceded by a 30-amino acid leader peptide. Removal of this leader peptide resulted in accumulation of non-functional PLD and also increased PLD degradation in E. coli, suggesting that this leader peptide may be involved in proper folding of PLD. The primary structure of the castor bean PLD exhibits no significant similarities with sequences of other cloned lipolytic enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1530607424,"The Slowpoke locus of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a family of alternatively spliced mRNAs which encode large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels. Variability residues in blocks of amino acids designated boxes A, C, E, G, and I. Oocytes were injected with cRNAs that had been chosen for direct functional comparison of single box differences. Single channel records from inside-out patches of oocyte membranes expressing A1 or A3 forms, E1 or E2 forms, and G2-G5 forms were analyzed and compared. The main functional difference between A1 and A3 was in unitary conductance, whereas the main difference in properties between E1 and E2 was in calcium sensitivity. Activation kinetics were different between G3 and G5, but not consistently in different A and E box backgrounds. The results indicate that alternative splicing of a common RNA precursor contributes to the functional diversity of the expressed channel. Our findings suggest that the variable region of the Slowpoke channel subunit comprises modular, yet interactive functional domains which influence the essential features of unit conductance, calcium sensitivity, and gating."
https://openalex.org/W1587275242,"Abstract An amino acid which appears to be involved in an agonist binding site of the gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor protein has been identified by photoaffinity labeling of affinity purified bovine receptor with [3H]muscimol and microsequencing of a chymotryptic fragment. Sequencing of a major purified labeled peptide gave the sequence Thr-Ile-Asp-Val-Phe with release of 3H label in the fifth cycle, corresponding to Phe. These 5 residues match the published sequence for the bovine alpha 1 subunit beginning at Thr61, following the chymotryptic substrate Tyr60. This sequence is found in the alpha 1-3 subunits of rat and cow and alpha 5 of rat, but not in any beta. Although previous evidence tentatively suggested that the beta subunit was the major [3H]muscimol-labeled subunit, homomeric expression studies have shown the potential for a functional gamma-aminobutyric acid binding site on all classes of subunits. The residue carrying the label, Phe65 on alpha 1, is conserved among all GABAA receptor alpha subunits, gamma 2, and delta. In addition, recent data indicated that a point mutation of Phe64-->Leu in rat alpha 1 subunit strongly decreased agonist and antagonist affinity when coexpressed with beta 2 and gamma 2 subunits in Xenopus oocytes (Sigel, E., Baur, R., Kellenberger; S., and Malherbe, P. (1992) EMBO J. 11, 2017-2023). The photolabeled Phe residue identified in this report is the bovine homolog to the Phe64 identified by the mutation studies of Sigel et al., to affect function in the rat GABAA receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1499861468,"Factor VIIIa is a non-covalent heterotrimer of A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 subunits. Previously, we speculated that the central portion of the A2 subunit, in and around the activated protein C-sensitive bond at Arg562-Gly (Fay, P. J., Smudzin, T.M., and Walker, F.J. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 20139-20145), is important for macromolecular interactions within the factor Xase enzyme complex. A peptide corresponding to factor VIII residues 558-565, SVDQRGNQ and designated FVIII558-565, was chemically synthesized and inhibited factor Xa generation in a purified system with an apparent KI of 105 microM. Tryptic cleavage of FVIII558-565 eliminated its inhibitory activity, whereas a scrambled sequence version of the peptide possessed < 30% the inhibitory activity of the native version. Overlapping peptides FVIII556-564 and FVIII561-569 were also inhibitory and confirmed the importance of residues in and around the scissile bond for functional factor Xase. Kinetic analysis revealed that peptide-mediated inhibition was non-competitive with respect to factor X. However, increasing factor IXa concentration overcame the observed inhibition. Furthermore, the peptide inhibited the factor IXa-dependent enhancement of factor VIIIa reconstituted from isolated A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer plus A2 subunit. Isolated factor VIII heavy chain (contiguous A1-A2 domains) was cleaved at Arg336 by an equimolar concentration of factor IXa in a reaction that was phospholipid-independent. No proteolysis of the isolated A1 subunit was observed in a similar reaction. These results indicate that the A2 subunit sequence delineated by residues 558-565 contributes to the interaction of cofactor with protease and that this interaction is essential for intrinsic factor Xase activity. Furthermore, that this peptide blocks both factor Xase activity and the capacity of factor IXa to stabilize the labile factor VIIIa heterotrimer suggest that this latter property is of physiologic significance."
https://openalex.org/W1523092355,"It was previously found that the 85-kDa protein purified from rat brain using an inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3)-immobilized matrix was the delta 1 isoform of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PLC). We expressed rat PLC-delta 1 in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase, and found that the bacterial lysate shows a significant amount of Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding. The lysate was applied to Ins(1,4,5)P3-immobilized column chromatography and the eluate with 2 M NaCl solution containing only a 100-kDa protein showed high Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding. The lysate was also purified to near homogeneity using a glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity system. Bacterially-expressed enzyme thus purified showed essentially the same inositol phosphate binding characteristics as the brain-derived enzyme. PLC-delta 1 consists of the amino-terminal nonconserved region and two well-conserved regions among isozymes, designated as X and Y, which are thought to constitute a catalytic core of the enzyme. Using a combination of deletion mutants and proteolytic products of the enzyme, we were able to locate an Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding domain in the molecule. Deletion of 223 residues from the amino terminus completely abolished the binding activity, while deletion of X region only partially inhibited the binding and deletion of Y region did not affect the binding. A 76-kDa proteolytic product of the expressed PLC-delta 1 which lacked 60 amino acids at the amino terminus showed a minimal Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding activity. A peptide consists of 14 amino acids corresponding to residues 30-43 of PLC-delta 1, which contains 6 basic amino acids, binds to an Ins(1,4,5)P3-immobilized matrix. Moreover, Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding was blocked by phospholipid vesicles containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. These results, taken together, indicate that the amino-terminal domain of PLC-delta 1 is important for the binding of both Ins(1,4,5)P3 and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1537087455,"The erythrocyte glucose transporter (Glut 1) is predicted to contain 12 membrane-spanning domains based on the hydropathy plot of its deduced amino acid sequence. The membrane topology of Glut 1 was analyzed by a scanning mutagenesis procedure in which the glycosylated exofacial domain of Glut 4 was inserted independently into each of the putative hydrophilic soluble domains of an aglyco-Glut 1 construct. The transporter mutants were expressed both in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation system and in vivo in Xenopus oocytes. The cytoplasmic or exofacial orientation of each soluble domain was inferred from the glycosylation state of the corresponding insertion mutant. The results from the cell-free system were aberrant in that two topological orientations were observed when the epitope was inserted into any of the short cytoplasmic loops or the NH2 terminus. The in vivo data, however, were in complete agreement with the proposed 12-helix model. Therefore, the multiple topologies observed in vitro probably resulted from the inability of the cell-free system to facilitate the proper folding of the insertion mutants into the membrane. 2-Deoxyglucose uptake data on the glycosylation mutants indicated that epitope insertion into the NH2 terminus, the large central loop, or the second, third, or fifth exofacial loop had no dramatic effect on the activity of the transporter. However, insertion into the other soluble domains either completely abolished or significantly reduced transport activity."
https://openalex.org/W1544733266,"A complementary DNA encoding an inward rectifier K+ channel (HRK1) was isolated from human hippocampus using a 392-base pair cDNA (HHCMD37) as a probe. HRK1 shows sequence similarity to three recently cloned inwardly rectifying potassium channels (IRK1, GIRK1, and ROMK1, 60, 42, and 37%, respectively) and has a similar proposed topology of two membrane spanning domains that correspond to the inner core structure of voltage gated K+ channels. When HRK1 was expressed in Xenopus oocytes, large inward K+ currents were observed below the K+ reversal potential but very little outward K+ current was observed. In on-cell membrane patches, single channel conductance (g) was estimated to be 10 picosiemens by both direct measurement and noise analysis, in 102 mM external [K+]. HRK1 currents were blocked by external Ba2+ and Cs+ (K(0) = 183 microM, and K(-130) = 30 microM, respectively), and internal tetraethylammonium ion (K(0) = 62 microM), but were insensitive to external tetraethylammonium ion. The functional properties of HRK1 are very similar to those of glial cell inward rectifier K+ channels and HRK1 may represent a glial cell inward rectifier."
https://openalex.org/W1500539090,"The role of the proximal histidine ligand in peroxidase function was studied by replacing the His side chain in cytochrome c peroxidase with Gln, Glu, or Cys. In addition, a double mutant was prepared where His-175 is converted to Gln and the site of free radical formation in Compound I, Trp-191 (Sivaraja, M., Goodin, D.B., Smith, M., and Hoffman, B. M. (1989) Science 245, 738-740), is converted to Phe. With the exception of the His-175–>Cys mutant, the proximal ligand mutants retain high levels of enzyme activity. Stopped flow studies show that replacing the His ligand with Gln has only a modest effect on the rate of Compound I formation demonstrating that the precise nature of the proximal ligand is not important in achieving a high rate of peroxide O-O bond cleavage. The double mutant, His-175–>Gln/Trp-191–>Phe, also forms Compound I rapidly but the initial product formed is very likely a long-lived porphyrin pi cation radical that slowly converts to a species more closely resembling the heme oxyferryl center of wild type Compound I. The relevance of these studies to the cytochrome c peroxidase-cytochrome c electron transfer system are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1592463599,"A new family of closely related glycoproteins, collectively called amastins, has been found on the surface of the amastigote form of Trypanosoma cruzi. The gene family encoding these amastigote-specific proteins was identified by differentially screening an amastigote cDNA library with reverse transcribed poly(A)+ RNA from amastigote and epimastigote stages of the parasite. Amastins are encoded by eight or more tandem genes, at least five of which are distinguished by nucleotide point changes. The 1.4-kilobase amastin mRNAs are 50 times more abundant in amastigotes than in epimastigotes or trypomastigotes. The amastin genes are transcribed to an equal extent in both amastigotes and epimastigotes, indicating that the stage-specific amastin mRNA levels are determined by a post-transcriptional mechanism. Sequence determination of full-length cDNAs reveals an open reading frame encoding 174 amino acids and a 700-base pair 3'-untranslated region. Nascent amastins contain four distinct hydrophobic regions of 20-30 amino acids each, 2 at internal locations and 1 each at the N and C termini."
https://openalex.org/W1553026206,"The role of the protooncogene product p95vav in signal transduction was investigated by characterizing its interactions with proteins that may represent components of a novel signaling pathway. We demonstrate here stable association of p95vav with the heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP-K), a protein that not only was found to be part of hnRNP particles but has also been implicated in transcriptional regulation of the c-myc gene. Through the PLPPPPPPRG sequence, hnRNP-K specifically interacts with the SH3 domain of p95vav and thus represents a novel SH3 binding protein that may be capable of translating cell surface receptor signals through p95vav activation into regulatory events on the level of gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1542598870,"A specific assay of 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG) was developed in our laboratory to help elucidate the relationship between advanced Maillard reaction and diabetic complications. 3-DG is known as a highly reactive intermediate of the reaction in vitro and a precursor of advanced glycosylation end products such as pyrraline and pentosidine, which have been previously detected in vivo. 3-DG was converted to a stable compound, 2-(2,3,4-trihydroxybutyl)-benzo[g]quinoxaline, by reacting with 2,3-diaminonaphthalene. Since the derivative had a characteristic UV spectrum, it was determined at 268 nm by high performance liquid chromatography. This method was sensitive enough to detect 10 ng/ml (61.7 nM) of 3-DG in vitro. A slight modification to this method allowed in vivo detection of small amounts of 3-DG. Plasma free 3-DG levels were significantly higher in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats compared with controls (918 +/- 134 nM versus 379 +/- 69 nM, p < 0.001) and were suppressed with the administration of aminoguanidine, an inhibitor of Maillard reaction. Plasma pyrraline levels in diabetic rats also increased in parallel with elevated 3-DG levels but were only marginally suppressed by administration of aminoguanidine. Our results indicate that 3-DG is present in vivo under normal conditions and that its level increases in diabetic subjects. Determination of 3-DG represents a good tool to predict development and progression of diabetic complications and to assess the efficiency of inhibitors to Maillard reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1495464089,"We have investigated the steady-state and presteady-state kinetics of the cloned H+/hexose cotransporter from Arabidopsis thaliana (STP1) expressed in Xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage-clamp method. Steady-state sugar-dependent currents were measured between -150 and +50 mV as a function of external [3-O-methyl-D-glucose] (3OMG) and [H+]. At pH 6.5 (316 nM H+) the maximal current for sugar, i3OMGmax, was voltage-dependent, increasing from 40 nA at -30 mV to 95 nA at -150 mV. The apparent affinity of sugar, K3OMG0.5, at pH 6.5 decreased from 30 microM at -30 mV to 11 microM at -70 mV and was then voltage-independent between -70 and -150 mV. Increasing the extracellular [H+] to 3160 nM (pH 5.5) increased i3OMGmax to 65 nA at -30 mV and 212 nA at -150 mV. K3OMG0.5 at pH 5.5 also increased and was voltage-dependent: 15 microM at -50 mV rising to 25 microM at -150 mV. At pH 6.5 and 5.5, the Hill coefficient n for 3OMG was voltage-independent and averaged 1.2 and 1.4, respectively. At saturating [3OMG] iHmax was voltage-dependent and KH0.5 was voltage-independent, averaging 370 nM (pH 6.4). The Hill coefficient n for H+ was voltage-independent and averaged 1. The sugar specificity of STP1 was D-mannose > or = 2-deoxyglucose > D-galactose > or = 3OMG > D-xylose > D-glucose > D-fucose > D-fructose > L-glucose > L-arabinose > D-arabinose, demonstrating that STP1 has a low substrate specificity. Transient currents recorded after rapid steps in membrane potential relaxed with time constants tau, between 3 and 14 ms. The charge movement Q (the integral of the current transients) fitted to a Boltzmann relation with maximal charge Qmax of 3.4 nanocoulombs and an apparent valence z approximately 1 corresponding to a transporter density of 2 x 10(10)/oocyte. Potential for 50% Qmax (V0.5) was -28 mV. At saturating 3OMG and at low external [H+] (pH 7.5), the transient STP1 currents were eliminated. The presteady-state data indicate that STP1 can bind H+ in the absence of sugar, and the steady-state data suggest that H+/hexose cotransport occurs via a sequential mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1504468085,"Activation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the epidermal growth factor and insulin receptors, induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc proteins and their association with the SH2 domain-containing adaptor protein Grb2. The Shc-Grb2 complex has been implicated in coupling these receptors to p21ras. The B cell antigen receptor plays a key role in directing B cell proliferation and differentiation. Although the B cell receptor lacks intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, its mode of action parallels that of receptor tyrosine kinases in many aspects. B cell receptor stimulation activates src-related tyrosine kinases and the tyrosine kinase syk, which leads to phosphorylation of various cytoplasmic proteins and initiates multiple signaling events, including p21ras activation. Therefore, we have investigated whether Shc proteins are targets for the activated B cell receptor. It was found that the 52- and 46-kDa forms of Shc are expressed in mature human B cells and become rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine upon B cell receptor stimulation. Also, Shc is induced to associate with the Grb2 molecule and an undefined 130-kDa protein. In a specific response to B cell activation, the Shc-Grb2 complex associates with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, including two prominent phosphoproteins with molecular masses of 130 and 110 kDa. These observations strongly suggest that the Shc and Grb2 adaptor proteins are involved in coupling the B cell antigen receptor to one or multiple signal transduction pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1501783721,"The possible role of 5 transmembrane amino acid residues in the function of the Glut1 glucose transporter was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis. The residues were chosen based on their containing hydroxyl or amide side chains capable of hydrogen bonding to glucose and their complete conservation in Glut1 through Glut5. Asn100, Gln161, Gln200, Tyr292, and Tyr293 were individually replaced by hydrophobic and/or polar residues, and the mutants were analyzed by expression in Xenopus oocytes. Substitution of leucine or asparagine for Gln161 reduced the relative transport activity of Glut1 by 50- and 10-fold, respectively, as measured by uptake of 2-deoxyglucose normalized to the plasma membrane content of the mutant transporters. Substitutions at the other residues had either a modest (approximately 2-fold) effect or no effect on the relative transport activity. The Ki for binding of the exofacial ligand 4,6-O-ethylidene-alpha-D-glucose to Glut1 was increased by 18-fold upon substitution of asparagine for Gln161. The Km for zero-trans influx of 2-deoxyglucose was not affected by the substitution of asparagine for Gln161, but the catalytic turnover was decreased by 7.5-fold. These data, combined with the high degree of conservation of Gln161 among the specific members of the 12-helix membrane transporter superfamily that transport hexoses, support the contention that Gln161 forms part of the exofacial substrate-binding site of these molecules. However, the decreased transport activity resulting from mutations at Gln161 is likely due to an additional effect on the rate of a conformational change involved in net substrate uptake. This constitutes the first evidence that a residue within the NH2 terminal half of Glut1 is critical for transport function."
https://openalex.org/W1639346960,"The fluorescence of residue Trp beta 331 in beta Y331W mutant Escherichia coli F1-ATPase was used as reporter probe to investigate the effects of magnesium ions, inhibitors, and mutation on substrate (ATP) binding stoichiometry and cooperativity. It was found that Mg2+ is required for catalytic site binding cooperativity. In the absence of magnesium, ATP bound to three independent catalytic sites, each with Kd = 76 microM. In contrast, MgATP bound to three catalytic sites with Kd1 < 50 nM, Kd2 = 0.5 microM, and Kd3 = 25 microM. There was no significant ATPase activity in the absence of Mg2+. Catalysis is therefore correlated with substrate binding cooperativity and the formation of the high-affinity catalytic site 1. Catalytic site 3 had properties similar to those of the isolated beta-subunit nucleotide-binding site. The inhibitors dicyclohexylcarbodiimide and N-ethylmaleimide (in alpha S373C/beta Y331W mutant F1) gave potent inhibition of multisite ATPase activity without significantly affecting MgATP binding stoichiometry or cooperativity. Therefore each seems to selectively attenuate positive catalytic cooperativity. The same conclusions held for the alpha S373F mutation (in alpha S373F/beta Y331W mutant F1). 7-Chloro-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole, however, reduced the catalytic site MgATP binding stoichiometry from three to two, and appears to inhibit catalysis by sterically blocking catalytic site 3."
https://openalex.org/W1575449807,"The dctD gene product (DCTD) activates transcription from dctA by the sigma 54-holoenzyme form of RNA polymerase in Rhizobium meliloti. We have purified a constitutively active form of R. meliloti DCTD that lacks 142 amino acid residues from the N terminus (designated DCTDL143). Purified DCTDL143 recognized the DCTD-binding sites at the dctA promoter region and catalyzed the isomerization of closed complexes between sigma 54-holoenzyme and the dctA promoter to open complexes. Like the related sigma 54-dependent activators NTRC and NIFA, a purine nucleoside triphosphate with a hydrolyzable beta-gamma bond was required prior to transcription initiation for this isomerization. DCTDL143 hydrolyzed purine nucleoside triphosphates but not pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphates. As observed with NTRC-phosphate, the specific activity for the ATPase of DCTDL143 was strongly dependent on the enzyme concentration and was stimulated by DNA fragments bearing the binding sites for the protein. These DNA fragments increased the Vmax for MgATP hydrolysis but did not significantly lower the apparent Km for MgATP. These data are consistent with the idea proposed for related activators that DCTDL143 must assemble into an active, oligomeric form before it can hydrolyze MgATP and presumably activate transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1553197770,"Peroxisomes from different eukaryotic organisms house a multifunctional protein acting in fatty acid beta-oxidation. In plant glyoxysomes, one of the isoforms of this protein contains the activities of L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydrolyase (EC 4.2.1.17), L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.211), D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase, and delta 3,delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase (EC 5.3.3.8). This was demonstrated after molecular cloning of a cDNA coding for a protein of 79047 Da and its bacterial expression. Chromatographic purification yielded a monomeric protein exhibiting all four activities. In addition, mutant forms were prepared, and peptides representing single domains were purified. Peptides containing the N-terminal region showed D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase and delta 3,delta 2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activities but lacked 2-trans-enoyl-CoA hydratase and L-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activities. Using the N-terminal fragment, we demonstrated that the D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA converting activity is actually an epimerase rather than part of a combined water eliminating and water attaching system. The C-terminal half of the multifunctional protein represents the dehydrogenase domain."
https://openalex.org/W1512995354,"Abstract Influenza hemagglutinin (HA, strain A/PR/8/34) was purified and reconstituted into supported planar membranes in a two-step process: 1) HA was purified by C12E8 detergent solubilization followed by detergent removal with Biobeads; (2) the purified HA was then incorporated into viroplanes, i.e. supported planar membranes which contained the viral membrane proteins. This step was accomplished by a spontaneous reaction of the HA-proteoliposomes with a phospholipid monolayer that was supported on a quartz microscope slide. The reconstitution of the HA into the planar membranes was followed by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) using fluorescein-labeled HA. By changing the solution concentration of HA, surface concentrations between 2.4 x 10(4) and 4.3 x 10(4) HA monomers/micron 2 were reached. Greater than 90% of all HA molecules were oriented with their ectodomain facing away from the substrate toward the large aqueous compartment of the measuring cell. Binding experiments with conformation-sensitive monoclonal antibodies against HA established that the reconstituted HA could undergo the low pH-induced conformational change in the supported bilayer. Binding of vesicles containing the fluorescent lipid analog N-(7-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)egg phosphatidylethanolamine was also measured by TIRFM. Vesicle binding was promoted when sialic acid-containing gangliosides or negatively charged lipids were included in these target membranes. Membrane fusion of the HA bound vesicles was monitored by measuring long range (over several micrometers) lateral diffusion coefficients of the lipids in the bound layer by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. The vesicles did not fuse at pH 7.4, but efficient vesicle fusion occurred on the viroplanes after acidification of the environment with pH 5 buffer. This fusion reaction was only observed when the bound vesicles exceeded a critical threshold surface concentration. The successful reconstitution of membrane fusion sites in a planar supported membrane system opens new possibilities for studying fusion intermediates by localized spectroscopy and microscopy."
https://openalex.org/W1486289829,"Apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange mediates virtually all of transepithelial HCO3- absorption in the rat medullary thick ascending limb (MTAL). Regulation of the apical exchanger by intracellular pH (pHi) and hyperosmolality was studied in the isolated, perfused MTAL by measurement of pHi using the fluorescent probe 2',7'-bis-(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein. Under isosmotic conditions (290 mosmol/kg H2O), the Na+/H+ exchange rate increased sigmoidally over the pHi range 7.8 to 6.5 (Hill coefficient = 2.1), consistent with cooperative activation of the exchanger by internal H+. The exchanger had a high apparent affinity for intracellular H+ (apparent pK = 7.36), which resulted in the exchanger being maximally active at resting pHi and insensitive to changes in pHi over the physiologic pHi range (6.5-7.2). Hyperosmolality (590 mosmol/kg H2O) inhibited Na+/H+ exchange by at least 35% at all pHi values studied and induced pHi dependence of the exchanger between 6.5 and 7.2. The inhibition by hyperosmolality appeared to be the result of an acid shift of the pHi dependence curve of the exchanger. These functional properties of apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange can account for our previous observations that hyperosmolality inhibited net HCO3- absorption and that the rate of HCO3- absorption did not correlate with pHi. Apical membrane Na+/H+ exchange in the MTAL differs functionally from Na+/H+ exchange in other cell types in which exchanger activity is stimulated rather than inhibited by hyperosmolality."
https://openalex.org/W1562950149,"The genes encoding both components, MutE and MutS, of adenosylcobalamin-dependent glutamate mutase from Clostridium tetanomorphum have been over-expressed in Escherichia coli. This has allowed MutE to be obtained in homogeneous form, free of inhibiting cobamides and traces of MutS. MutE binds MutS cooperatively, with a Hill coefficient of 1.3. The recombinant enzyme has an unchanged Km for L-glutamate, but a much higher specific activity than those previously reported for preparations from clostridia. The apparent Km for adenosylcobalamin was dependent upon the concentration of MutS and varied between 18 microM with equimolar concentrations of MutS and MutE and 5.8 microM with a 5-fold molar excess of MutS over MutE present in the assay. The dissociation constant for adenosylcobalamin was measured directly using equilibrium gel filtration. In the presence of equimolar amounts of MutE and MutS, the apparent Kd was 5.4 microM, but this decreased to 1.8 microM when MutS was present at a 5-fold molar excess. No binding of adenosylcobalamin to MutE was observed in the absence of MutS. This suggests that the (minimal) function for MutS, whose role in the reaction has been unclear until now, is to form part of the adenosylcobalamin-binding site. It seems likely that MutS is representative of a cobalamin-binding domain conserved across several cobalamin-dependent enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1510205875,"Nucleotide-induced structural rearrangements of MalK, the ATP-hydrolyzing component of the ATP binding cassette transporter for maltose from Salmonella typhimurium were investigated by means of analysis of intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and limited proteolysis. ATP was found to decrease the tryptophan fluorescence of purified MalK by 37 +/- 1%. ADP or adenosine 5‘-O-(3-(thio)triphosphate) (ATP gamma S) caused similar quenching while AMP was rather ineffective. Mg2+ ions were not required. Exposure of MalK to increasing concentrations of trypsin and subsequent analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting revealed the formation of three major transiently stable peptide fragments of 24 (T2), 23 (T3), and 20 kDa (T4), respectively. In addition, a minor rapidly degraded fragment of 33 kDa (T1) was observed. However, in the presence of MgATP, fragment T1 as well as a substantial fraction of native MalK were strongly protected against proteolytic attack. Similar protection against the protease was observed in the presence of MgGTP or, to a lesser extent, MgCTP. In contrast, MgADP, ATP in the presence of EDTA, CaATP or nonhydrolyzable nucleotides such as MgATP gamma S or MgAMP-PNP (beta, gamma-imidoadenosine-5‘-triphosphate) failed to significantly affect the susceptibility of MalK to the protease. MgATP similarly affected the tryptic digestion pattern of a mutant protein (MalKK42R) that exhibits only a much reduced ATPase activity but has retained the capability to bind nucleotides. N-terminal protein sequence analysis of the peptides revealed cleavage by trypsin at Arg66 (T1), Arg146 (T2), Arg153 (T3), and Arg185 (T4), respectively. These results indicate that (i) nucleotide binding to MalK is accompanied by a global conformational change of the protein; (ii) a very specific interaction occurs with substrates of the MalK-ATPase, resulting in structural changes that involve the helical domain from Arg66 to Arg146; and (iii) the C-terminal half of MalK is rather resistant to proteolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1637272774,"The 70-kDa protein that is present on the surface of lymphocytes and macrophages and that binds peptidoglycan, lipopolysaccharide, lipoteichoic acid, heparin, and sulfated heparinoids was identified as cell-bound albumin. It originated from the tissue culture medium or from the serum in vivo and was not produced by the cells. The following results supported this conclusion: (a) mouse and human cell lines grown in serum-free and albumin-free medium did not have this 70-kDa protein and did not bind peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide in photoaffinity cross-linking assay; (b) the appearance of the 70-kDa protein in these cells and the ligand binding were restored by 30-min incubation with serum or purified albumin; (c) soluble albumin bound peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide, and this binding was inhibited by the same competitive inhibitors that inhibited the binding to the 70-kDa cellular protein; (d) albumin co-migrated with the 70-kDa cellular protein in two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; (e) peptide maps of albumin and the 70-kDa cellular protein digested with four proteases were identical; (f) the only protein recognized by anti-albumin monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies on Western immunoblots was the 70-kDa protein that exactly matched with the cellular peptidoglycan/lipopolysaccharide-binding protein; (g) anti-albumin monoclonal antibodies immunoprecipitated the 70-kDa cellular protein; and (h) species-specific anti-bovine, anti-human, and anti-mouse albumin antibodies recognized the 70-kDa protein on mouse and human cells according to the species of albumin that was present in the culture medium or in the serum in vivo, but not according to the species of the cells. The cell-bound albumin was not required for cell activation, because macrophage cell lines that were grown in albumin-free medium and did not have the cell-bound albumin (the 70-kDa protein) fully responded to the stimulation by peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharide with production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1498067249,"Geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase was purified to homogeneity from bovine brain in a one-step procedure employing an affinity column. For the construction of the affinity column, a farnesyl diphosphate analog, O-(6-amino-1-hexyl)-P-farnesylmethyl phosphonophosphate, was synthesized and linked to the spacer of the matrix of Affi-Gel 10 via the amino group. The native enzyme appeared to be a homooligomer (150-195 kDa) with a molecular mass of the monomer of 37.5 kDa. The pI for the enzyme was 6.2. The Km values for dimethylallyl diphosphate, geranyl diphosphate, and farnesyl diphosphate were estimated to be 33, 0.80, and 0.74 microM, respectively. The Km value for isopentenyl diphosphate in the reaction with isopentenyl diphosphate and farnesyl diphosphate was 2 microM. The reaction velocities for the formation of geranylgeranyl diphosphate from dimethylallyl diphosphate, geranyl diphosphate, and farnesyl diphosphate were in the ratio of 0.004:0.145:1. The intermediate farnesyl diphosphate was formed in the reaction with geranyl diphosphate as an allylic primer. Geranylgeranyl diphosphate acted as a competitive inhibitor against farnesyl diphosphate with an approximate Ki value of 1.2 microM in the condensation reaction of farnesyl diphosphate with isopentenyl diphosphate. Farnesyl-diphosphate synthase catalyzing the formation of farnesyl diphosphate from dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate was also purified to homogeneity from the same organ by similar affinity chromatography using a geranyl diphosphate analog, O-(6-amino-1-hexyl)-P-geranylmethyl phosphonophosphate, as a ligand. This enzyme was a homodimer with a monomeric molecular mass of 40.0 kDa. These results indicate that geranylgeranyl diphosphate, a lipid precursor for the biosynthesis of a majority of prenylated proteins, is synthesized from dimethylallyl diphosphate and isopentenyl diphosphate by the action of farnesyl-diphosphate synthase catalyzing the reaction of C5-->C15, followed by the action of geranylgeranyl-diphosphate synthase catalyzing a single reaction of C15-->C20, and that geranylgeranyl diphosphate can down-regulate its own synthesis through the inhibition of the geranylgeranyldiphosphate synthase action."
https://openalex.org/W1483108553,"By using polyclonal antiserum, which recognizes multiple proteoglycan core proteins, we isolated a cDNA species for an unknown chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in bovine brain. Unexpectedly, DNA sequencing revealed that the cDNA encodes an open reading frame highly homologous to the human receptor-type protein-tyrosine phosphatase, RPTP beta. To prove that RPTP beta is a proteoglycan, we raised three polyclonal antibodies against extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of human RPTP beta. These antibodies have been shown to react with a smear band ranging from 350 to 500 kDa in human brain extracts. Digestion with chondroitinase ABC eliminated this smear and gave rise to a 310/300-kDa doublet band that was not detected without digestion, indicating that almost all of the RPTP beta molecules in the brain contain chondroitin sulfate chains. In the cerebellum, immunofluorescence staining of chondroitinase-treated sections revealed pericellular localization of RPTP beta in the external and internal granular layers. These data establish that RPTP beta is expressed constitutively as a chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan in the brain, and suggest that chondroitin sulfates may be an essential component for the physiological function of RPTP beta in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1524938028,"Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has been shown to bind two distinct receptors, designated p60 and p80, with high affinity, resulting, within minutes, in phosphorylation of several proteins. The receptors themselves do not exhibit protein kinase activity nor have any associated proteins been identified. We employed the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) fusion protein system consisting of the cytoplasmic domain of p60 (GST-p60CD delta 1) as a probe to help us identify receptor-associated proteins from human histiocytic lymphoma U-937 cells. We found that a protein of approximately 52 kDa (pp52) bound to GST-p60CD delta 1 from [35S]methionine- and 32P-labeled cells. The associated protein was phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues. Furthermore, we identified serine/threonine kinase activity associated with p60CD delta 1 that required either Mn2+ or Mg2+ for optimal activity. The preferred substrates for this kinase, in addition to p60CD delta 1, included casein and histone H1, but not histone H2B, myelin basic protein, enolase, or the cytoplasmic domain of p80. As was the case in U-937 cells, p60CD delta 1-associated kinase activity was also identified in human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells and human foreskin fibroblasts. TNF stimulation of MCF-7 and foreskin fibroblasts for 5-15 min induced approximately 50 and 240% increases in phosphorylation of p60CD delta 1, respectively. Thus, our results provide the first evidence for protein kinase activity that is specifically associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the p60 form of the TNF receptor and causes its phosphorylation. This p60 TNF receptor-associated protein and the associated kinase described here are referred to as p60-TRAP and p60-TRAK, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1552962149,"Abstract A new physiological target for Cdc2 protein kinase has been identified. It corresponds to a protein EF-1 delta, a constituent of the nucleotide exchange factor EF-1 beta gamma delta, involved in the elongation step of protein synthesis. EF-1 delta is phosphorylated by Cdc2 kinase on threonine and serine residues. Threonine has been identified as Thr122 in the sequence VQVTPAAK. During oocyte maturation, Thr122 is phosphorylated at metaphase, when p34cdc2 is active. Phosphorylation studies revealed the presence of two post-translational regulated forms of EF-1 delta protein. Identification of two isoforms of the delta protein, together with the presence of two guanine-nucleotide exchange proteins (beta and delta) and physiologically regulated phosphorylation sites by Cdc2 kinase on gamma and delta proteins, implicate that EF-1 beta gamma delta exists in the cell under a multitude of macromolecular forms which suggests that EF-1 beta gamma delta is a sophisticated regulatory factor rather than a housekeeping element of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1502732154,"Our objective was to identify the major compositional factor(s) of very low density lipoprotein which determines its properties as a substrate for lipoprotein lipase. Human very low density lipoprotein was fractionated by preparative electrophoresis. The apparent Km was significantly lower for pre-beta very low density lipoprotein compared with beta very low density lipoprotein when calculated on the basis of triglyceride concentration. When the triglyceride concentration was adjusted for the triglyceride/apolipoprotein B ratio, the apparent Km was not different among very low density lipoprotein fractions. This implied that very low density lipoprotein particle number was of primary importance. To test this hypothesis further, rabbit cholesterol-rich very low density lipoprotein and human intermediate density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein, from a patient with hepatic lipase deficiency, were added to the incubations. Each of these fractions functioned as noncompetitive inhibitors of lipolysis. We speculate that the saturation of lipoprotein lipase by an excess number of particles is a characteristic of human hyperlipoproteinemias that predispose to coronary heart disease and that are commonly classified as familial combined hyperlipoproteinemia or hyperapobetalipoproteinemia."
https://openalex.org/W1594338269,"The function of the SunY protein, encoded by an intron-containing gene of bacteriophage T4, has remained hitherto unknown in contrast to the extensively studied self-splicing reaction of the SunY intron. Here we show that anaerobic T4 infections of Escherichia coli induce a ribonucleoside triphosphate reductase activity that is 10-30-fold higher than the bacterial host level of the corresponding enzyme. Inactivation of the T4 sunY gene (in this communication renamed nrdD) significantly decreased both the induced activity and the anaerobic production of phage, confirming the role of the T4 NrdD (SunY) protein as a phage-specific anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase. With the identification of the T4 nrdD (sunY) gene product as an anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase, all known bacteriophage introns are found to share the common and as yet unexplained property of residing within genes of DNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1540176830,"Human thymidylate synthase (TS) protein specifically binds to its own TS mRNA and functions as a translational repressor. In the presence of reducing agents, the RNA binding activity of TS protein is significantly enhanced. In contrast, treatment of TS protein with the oxidizing agent diamide inhibits RNA binding. Scatchard analysis reveals that in the presence of the reducing agent 2-mercaptoethanol, the TS protein/TS mRNA interaction changes from low (Kd = 66 nM) to high (Kd = 2.6 nM) apparent affinity. The catalytic activity of TS is increased by up to 6.5-fold in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. These studies demonstrate that the interaction between TS protein and its target TS mRNA is sensitive to the presence of reducing reagents and is dependent upon a reversible sulfhydryl switch mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1503059876,"Ferritin synthesis is regulated at the translational level by iron, but it is likely that transcriptional regulation of H and L genes is responsible for tissue-specific distribution of H and L mRNAs. In order to define the regions important for transcriptional regulation of the mouse ferritin H gene, we have linked the promoter, including the transcription start site, and 5 kilobases of upstream sequence to a reporter gene (human growth hormone). This construct and a series of 5' deletion mutants have been used to transfect erythroid (K562, mouse erythroleukemia (MEL)) and hepatoma (HepG2) cell lines. Measurement of growth hormone in the culture medium and analysis of ferritin-growth hormone transcripts by a ribonuclease protection assay revealed that a 140-base pair minimal promoter is sufficient to confer a high level of expression to the reporter gene in both cell types. In addition, a 180-base pair fragment, lying 4.5 kilobases upstream of the ferritin transcription start site, functions like an inducible enhancer during N,N'-hexamethylene-bis-acetamide-induced differentiation of MEL cells. A perfect match to a consensus binding motif to the erythroid transcription factor NF-E2 is present in this regulatory element, but the mutant NF-E2 enhancer retains the inducible activity in stably transfected MEL cells, and the results from gel retardation assays suggest that protein-DNA complexes that form in vitro between the ferritin enhancer and MEL nuclear extracts do not contain NF-E2. Thus, nuclear factors that mediate inducibility of the ferritin enhancer remain to be identified."
https://openalex.org/W1533108592,"The elongation factor 1 alpha from the archaebacterium Sulfolobus solfataricus (aEF-1 alpha) possesses an intrinsic GTPase activity that is triggered by NaCl up to 5.2 M and requires the presence of at least 1 mM MgCl2 or MnCl2. Chloride salts of other monovalent cations are inefficient, whereas other sodium salts are much less efficient or not efficient at all as compared with NaCl. This aEF-1 alpha GTPase (GTPaseNa) reaches a maximum in a broad pH range and is not affected by other nucleoside triphosphates but is competitively inhibited by GDP. The turnover of GTPaseNa is rate limited by the breakdown of GTP. The Km for GTP is in the range of 2.2-9.3 microM, depending on the NaCl concentration and temperature. The highest catalytic efficiency is reached at 87 degrees C, which is the optimum temperature for growth of S. solfataricus. The energetic parameters of GTPaseNa are similar to those reported in the literature for the GTPase of Escherichia coli elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) triggered by 2 M KCl, thus suggesting that the GTPase activity supported by either EF-Tu or aEF-1 alpha undergoes a similar mechanism of activation by salt at high concentration. A molecular mechanism for this activation is proposed."
https://openalex.org/W1647410008,"Enzyme I (EI), the first protein of the bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS), exists in a monomer/dimer (M/D) equilibrium. We have proposed that the two species are functionally different and that their interconversion may regulate sugar transport via the PTS. The C-terminal Cys of Escherichia coli EI was reacted with pyrene maleimide (Han, M. K., Roseman, S., and Brand, L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1985-1995), and the pyrene conjugate used to characterize the M/D equilibrium by fluorescence anisotropy. The properties of unlabeled and pyrene-labeled EI are indistinguishable. Values for the apparent association constant, K'eq, and the steady-state anisotropy of the monomer and the dimer were obtained under a variety of conditions. K'eq increases 23-fold, from 0.45 x 10(5) to 10.7 x 10(5) M-1, as the temperature increases from 6 to 30 degrees C; the association appears to be entropically driven. Under all conditions tested, the K'eq for phospho-EI is 6-12-fold less than for dephospho-EI. For phospho-EI, PEP and Mg2+ induce a 240-fold increase of K'eq when both ligands are present. Based on these data, EI was preincubated under conditions that change K'eq, and the initial activities of the different species were determined at 37 degrees C in a PTS sugar phosphorylation assay with PEP as the phosphoryl donor. The initial rate depends on the M/D ratio; it is maximal when EI is 100% dimer, and zero when EI is 100% monomer. In the latter case, the rate gradually increases in the assay mixture. The results have important implications for how the PTS regulates sugar transport and other physiological phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1565681144,"ApoE is a 34-kDa apoprotein that mediates lipoprotein binding to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and to the LDL receptor-related protein. Receptor binding is mediated by a highly basic, alpha-helical sequence of approximately 15 amino acids that interacts with cysteine-rich repeat regions of the receptor. To determine the relationship between the receptor binding and lipid associating properties of apoE, we have synthesized a series of apoE peptides containing all (residues 129-169) or part (residues 139-169, 144-169, and 148-169) of the receptor-binding domain. The lipophilicity of these peptides was increased by modification of their N termini by acylation with either palmitic acid (C16-apoE peptide) or the N,N-distearyl derivative of glycine (diC18-Gly-apoE peptide). The unmodified peptides demonstrated low affinity for lipid surfaces (Kd > 10(-5) M) and moderate alpha-helicity in the presence of lipid (40%) and had no effect on LDL uptake by fibroblasts. N-Palmitoyl peptides had increased affinity for lipid (Kd approximately 10(-6) M) and increased alpha-helicity (55%) in the presence of lipid. The addition of the C16-apoE-(129-169)-peptide to 125I-LDL enhanced its uptake and degradation by fibroblasts 8-10-fold; however, Gln) was much less effective than the wild-type peptide in potentiating binding, uptake, and degradation of 125I-LDL. Complexes of diC18-Gly-apoE-(129-169), apoA-I, and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine containing four to six copies of the peptide/particle displayed an affinity for the LDL receptor similar to that of apoE-L-alpha-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine discs containing four copies of apoE.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1573597423,"Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha) is synthesized and transported to the cell surface as a membrane-anchored precursor (proTGF-alpha) that is converted to the soluble form by proteolytic cleavage. ProTGF-alpha cleavage is activated in response to tumor-promoting phorbol ester or to calcium ionophore. Mechanism(s) controlling conversion of the membrane-anchored precursor to the soluble TGF-alpha are unknown, and the responsible protease has not been identified. Using the fluorogenic substrate succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide (Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-MCA), containing the sequence similar to the cleavage sites for proTGF-alpha processing, we identified a putative candidate proTGF-alpha-converting enzyme in the membrane fractions of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The enzyme activity was about 5-6-fold increased by exposure of the cells with phorbol ester or with calcium ionophore. The enzyme activity was released from the cells by trypsin added exogenously; hence, the activity probably locates on the outer surface of the cell membrane. The enzyme was partially purified from membranes of phorbol ester-treated CHO cells. The molecular mass of the enzyme was estimated to be about 84 kDa by gel filtration analysis. Inhibitor profile of the enzyme, including inhibition by serine protease inhibitors and no inhibition by elastatinal, coincides with that previously reported for proTGF-alpha cleavage activity on CHO cells. These findings suggest that the enzyme is a processing protease involved in the cleavage of proTGF-alpha and that induction of proTGF-alpha conversion by phorbol ester or by calcium ionophore can be attributed to activation of the processing protease. In the cell-free reconstitution system, the membrane-bound Suc-Ala-Ala-Ala-MCA-hydrolyzing enzyme from CHO cells was also activated by phorbol ester in the presence of the soluble fraction, ATP, and vanadate. Requirement of vanadate, an inhibitor for protein phosphatases, for activation of the enzyme in this system suggests that phosphorylation-dephosphorylation probably plays a key role in the regulated cleavage of proTGF-alpha."
https://openalex.org/W1639524097,"We have cloned and characterized the organization of the rat thyroid hormone receptor alpha (THR) gene. Multiple transcription start sites were mapped by RNA primer extension analyses. The promoter of the rat THR alpha gene does not contain a TATA or CAAT box. Deletion analyses of the 5' region of THR alpha gene and transfection assays, using NIH3T3 and NG108-15 cells, revealed that the sequences from -137 to +205 (+205 resides in the first intron) are necessary for efficient expression of this gene. This region contains two positively acting elements, the sequence -137 to -60 upstream from the major start of transcription and three copies of an AGG sequence located in the first intron. In contrast, two octamer-binding motifs in the first intron function as the negative regulatory elements. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the purine-rich sequence and the octamer-binding motifs bind to a protein(s) present in NIH3T3 and NG108-15 cells, the recipients in transient transfection assays. Genomic sequence comparison of THR alpha and beta revealed the presence of the purine-rich track in both genes, while the octamer-binding motifs were found only in the alpha gene. These results might explain the differential regulation of THR alpha and beta gene expression previously noted."

The alternative splicing of the prosaposin gene results in the inclusion or exclusion of exon 8 into transcribed prosaposin mRNA through the use of alternative acceptor sites. The relative abundance of each alternatively spliced mRNA was determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in various human tissues and cell lines. Exon 8 codes for only three amino acid residues, Gln-Asp-Gln, in the saposin B domain of prosaposin. The prosaposin mRNA containing exon 8 is the major species in cultured skin fibroblasts, brain, and pituitary glands together with a smaller amount of mRNA devoid of exon 8, whereas the prosaposin mRNA detected in liver and lymphoblasts was devoid of exon 8 insertion. Previous structural modeling studies on saposin B have suggested that the Gln-Asp-Gln insertion occurs in an amphipathic alpha-helix region of the protein which is implicated in the binding of GM1-ganglioside. We report that synthetic peptides containing the alpha-helix, with and without the Gln-Asp-Gln insertion, have different binding affinities for GM1-ganglioside, sulfatide, and sphingomyelin. The insertion of the Gln-Asp-Gln sequence completely abolishes the capacity of the peptide to bind GM1-ganglioside, whereas its affinity for sulfatide and sphingomyelin is increased about 4-fold and almost 2-fold, respectively. No significant binding of glucosylceramide was observed with both peptides. These results suggest that alternative splicing of prosaposin mRNA may change binding specificity of saposin B presumably to adapt to the variable sphingolipid composition of tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1569790945,"Resonance Raman spectra of the ferric homodimeric hemoglobin from Scapharca inaequivalvis have been measured over the pH range 5.8-8.3 in buffers of ionic strengths 0.01 and 0.1 M to determine the spin and coordination state of the iron atom. Three species contribute to the spectra: a low spin hexacoordinate, a high spin pentacoordinate, and a high spin hexacoordinate component. Optical absorption and EPR spectra measured under the same conditions allowed the identification of the ligands in the sixth coordination position, namely the distal histidine in the low spin derivative and a water molecule in the high spin one. The relative concentrations of these three species depend on pH in an unusual way. Thus, the aquomet derivative is present over the whole pH range, albeit in small amounts as most of the hemoglobin converts to the low spin hemichrome at acid pH values and to the pentacoordinate derivative at neutral and slightly alkaline ones. The formation of a pentacoordinate heme as the pH is increased has not been reported previously for other myoglobins and hemoglobins. Low ionic strength and high protein concentration favor the formation of the high spin pentacoordinate species, while at high ionic strength and low protein concentration the low spin hexacoordinate species prevails. Ionization of the iron-bound water molecule occurs at pH > or = 9.3; accordingly, signals from the hydroxyl derivative were not observed in the Raman spectra over the pH range studied."
https://openalex.org/W1585187138,"Mutations in the tus gene of Escherichia coli, which encodes the replication arrest protein Tus, were isolated using a selection scheme based on the plasmid pHV750T2+, which transforms tus mutants at a much higher frequency than wild type strains. Seven mutants containing single nucleotide substitutions were isolated, and all of these mutants showed reduced or complete loss of DNA binding and replication arrest activity. Two of the mutant proteins, containing a valine (A173V) or threonine (A173T) in place of the alanine normally found at amino acid 173, were purified and characterized further. A173T had a 4100-fold lower affinity for Ter sites than wild type Tus and was unable to halt DNA replication in vivo or inhibit DnaB-catalyzed strand displacement in an in vitro helicase assay. A173V showed a 130-fold lower affinity for Ter sites than wild type Tus but was still able to arrest DNA replication in vivo, suggesting that protein-protein interactions were responsible for Tus-mediated arrest of DNA replication. In addition, we found that A173V was a weak inhibitor of DnaB-catalyzed strand displacement in vitro, yet halted DNA replication in vivo at 75% of the efficiency of wild type Tus. We concluded from these observations that the standard in vitro helicase assay was inadequate for measuring Tus activity."
https://openalex.org/W1519946814,"We present evidence that zinc bound near the C terminus of a long tRNA synthetase polypeptide, and at a location far in the sequence from the catalytic domain, is needed to sustain cell growth and is, therefore, essential for enzyme function. Several class I and class II tRNA synthetases contain bound zinc, including the 939-amino acid class I Escherichia coli isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase, which has two zinc atoms coordinated to cysteine sulfhydryls. The functional significance of these bound zinc atoms has been unclear. Like other class I tRNA synthetases, the isoleucine enzyme has a class-defining conserved N-terminal domain that contains the catalytic site. The C-terminal domain is variable in sequence and structure and not conserved among all of the class I enzymes. Using split proteins, we localized a zinc binding site to the C-terminal end of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase. Serine substitutions of single cysteines at a thiol-containing putative zinc binding site that is less than 40 amino acids from the C terminus confer a zinc-dependent growth phenotype on cells harboring the mutant enzymes. We propose that zinc bound near the C terminus is part of a structure that interacts directly or indirectly with the active site. A structure at the C terminus that provides a functional link between the conserved N-terminal catalytic and non-conserved C-terminal domain may be common to several class I enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1665715392,"The oxidized homodimeric Scapharca inaequivalvis hemoglobin undergoes changes in coordination and spin state as a function of pH, ionic strength, and protein concentration which have been monitored by optical absorption spectroscopy. Three species contribute to the spectra between pH 5.8 and 8.7: (i) a hexacoordinate high spin aquomet derivative, whose concentration is essentially constant over the whole pH range analyzed; (ii) a pentacoordinate high spin component which prevails at alkaline pH values, and (iii) a hexacoordinate low spin hemichrome, which is formed at acid pH. The contribution of each of the components to the observed spectra was calculated with the singular value decomposition procedure and has been described quantitatively in terms of a linkage scheme which accounts for the change in heme coordination and for the observation that the high spin to low spin transition entails dissociation into monomers. An important feature of the linkage scheme is the cooperative binding of protons to aquomet dimers. Stopped flow experiments to study the kinetics indicate that dissociation into monomers is the rate-limiting process. The unusually strong tendency of oxidized HbI to loose the heme-bound water molecule is discussed in terms of strain in the iron-proximal histidine bond."
https://openalex.org/W1529732098,"Blastocrithidia culicis is a trypanosomatid protozoon that transfers Man6GlcNAc2 in protein N-glycosylation. Compounds containing mannosyl, xylosyl, and rhamnosyl residues were found among the endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H-sensitive oligosaccharides of whole cell glycoproteins of this parasite. The compositions of some of them were as follows: Man5GlcNAc2, Man6GlcNAc2, Rha1Man5GlcNAc2, Rha2Man6GlcNAc2, Xyl1Rha2Man6-GlcNAc2, Xyl1Rha3Man6GlcNAc2, and Xyl2Rha3Man6-GlcNAc2. On the other hand, oligosaccharides containing mannosyl, xylosyl, rhamnosyl, and ribosyl units were liberated from endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase-resistant glycopeptides upon treatment with N-glycanase. This is the first report on the presence of ribosyl units in eukaryote glycoconjugates, of rhamnosyl residues in asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, and of xylosyl units in high mannose-type compounds."
https://openalex.org/W1599880162,"Abstract Interactions of dithiols with p-aminophenyldichloroarsine (APA) and with Torpedo nicotinic receptors were studied using two approaches. First, the stability of dithiol-APA complexes in solution was studied based on quenching thiol reactions with dithiobis-(nitrobenzoic acid). A peptide corresponding to a portion of the Torpedo alpha-subunit and various 1,2-dithiols such as 2,3-dimercaptopropanesulfonic acid (DMPS), 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid formed stable complexes with APA, while 1,4-dithiols, such as dithiothreitol (DTT) and 2,5 dimercapto-N,N,N'N'-tetradipamide (DTA) did not. The Kd of APA association with DTT in Tris buffer is 2 microM. These data suggest that APA has greater affinity for reduced nicotinic receptors than for either DTT or DTA, a prediction that was experimentally confirmed, since these reagents do not reverse the effects of APA on nicotinic receptors. Second, application of DMPS and BAL, but not 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid, to DTT-treated receptors both reversed the effects of APA-receptor complexes and prevented alkylation by bromoacetylcholine, suggesting that DMPS and BAL reduced nicotinic receptors. The presence of air is required for this oxidizing effect, but no clear mechanism was discovered, since prevention of formation of the reactive oxygen species superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, or hydroxyl radicals failed to block oxidation. These data suggest that oxygen reacts with dithiols to produce unknown reactive species that directly oxidize reduced nicotinic receptors, although other interpretations are still possible."
