https://openalex.org/W4283385909,"The environmental issue has become a global problem that needs to be examined frequently, motivating researchers to investigate it. Thus, the present study has investigated the asymmetric impact of natural resources, technological innovation, and globalization on the ecological footprint in the presence of environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) economies. This research divided the BRI economies into high income, middle-income, and low-income levels to capture income differences. The study has used annual time series data from 1990 to 2018. The study applied a novel Augmented Mean Group estimators method to calculate the robust and reliable outcomes. The findings show that natural resources drastically damage the environment quality, whereas technological innovations are helpful in reducing environmental degradation. Moreover, the result of the interaction term (natural resources and technological innovations) negatively impacts the ecological footprint. Interestingly, these findings are similar in the three income groups. In addition, globalization improves environmental quality in the middle-income BRI economies but reduces in high-income, low-income, and full sample countries. Furthermore, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) concept has been validated across all BRI economies. In line with these findings, several relevant policies are recommended for a sustainable environment in the BRI economies."
https://openalex.org/W4283391528,"The rapid emergence and spread of numerous severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants across the globe underscores the crucial need for continuous SARS-CoV-2 surveillance to ensure that potentially more pathogenic variants are detected early and contained. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is currently the gold standard for COVID-19 surveillance; however, it remains cost-prohibitive and requires specialized technical skills. To increase surveillance capacity, especially in resource-scarce settings, supplementary methods that are cost- and time-effective are needed. Real-time multiplex PCR genotyping assays offer an economical and fast solution for screening circulating and emerging variants while simultaneously complementing existing WGS approaches. In this study we evaluated the AllplexTM SARS-CoV-2 Variants II multiplex real-time PCR genotyping assay, Seegene (South Korea), and implemented it in retrospectively characterizing circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants in a rural South African setting between April and October 2021, prior to the emergence of the Omicron variant in South Africa. The AllplexTM SARS-CoV-2 Variants II real-time PCR assay demonstrated perfect concordance with whole-genome sequencing in detecting Beta and Delta variants and exhibited high specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility. Implementation of the assay in characterization of SARS-CoV-2 variants between April and October 2021 in a rural South African setting revealed a rapid shift from the Beta to the Delta variant between April and June. All specimens successfully genotyped in April were Beta variants and the Delta variant was not detected until May. By June, 78% of samples genotyped were Delta variants and in July >95% of all genotyped samples were Delta variants. The Delta variant continued to predominate through to the end of our analysis in October 2021. Taken together, a commercial SARS-CoV-2 variant genotyping assay detected the rapid rate at which the Delta variant displaced the Beta variant in Limpopo, an under-monitored province in South Africa. Such assays provide a quick and cost-effective method of monitoring circulating variants and should be used to complement genomic sequencing for COVID-19 surveillance especially in resource-scarce settings."
https://openalex.org/W4283454215,"Several Public Health Services and general practitioners in the Netherlands observed an increase in scabies in the Netherlands. Since individual cases of scabies are not notifiable in the Netherlands, the epidemiological situation is mostly unknown. To investigate the scabies incidence in the Netherlands, we described the epidemiology of scabies between 2011 and 2021.Two national data sources were analysed descriptively. One data source obtained incidence data of scabies (per 1,000 persons) of persons consulting in primary care from 2011-2020. The other data source captured the number of prescribed scabicides in the Netherlands from 2011-2021. To describe the correlation between the incidence of diagnoses and the number of dispensations between 2011 and 2020, we calculated a correlation coefficient.The incidence of reported scabies has increased by more than threefold the last decade (2011-2020), mainly affecting adolescents and (young) adults. This was also clearly reflected in the fivefold increase in dispensations of scabicide medication during 2011-2021. The incidence and dispensations were at an all-time high in 2021. We found a strong correlation between the reported incidence and the number of dispensations between 2011 and 2020.More awareness on early diagnosis, proper treatment and treatment of close contacts is needed."
https://openalex.org/W4283466161,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative joint disease and is characterized by breakdown of joint cartilage. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) exerts diverse biological effects on bone and cartilage; observational studies have suggested that CoQ10 may slow OA progression and inflammation. However, any effect of CoQ10 on OA remains unclear. Here, we investigated the therapeutic utility of CoQ10-micelles.Seven-week-old male Wistar rats were injected with monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) to induce OA. CoQ10-micelles were administered orally to MIA-induced OA rats; celecoxib served as the positive control. Pain, tissue destruction, and inflammation were measured. The expression levels of catabolic and inflammatory cell death markers were assayed in CoQ10-micelle-treated chondrocytes.Oral supplementation with CoQ10-micelles attenuated OA symptoms remarkably, including pain, tissue destruction, and inflammation. The expression levels of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and MMP-13, and of the inflammatory cell death markers RIP1, RIP3, and pMLKL in synovial tissues were significantly reduced by CoQ10-micelle supplementation, suggesting that CoQ10-micelles might attenuate the synovitis of OA. CoQ10-micelle addition to cultured OA chondrocytes reduced the expression levels of catabolic and inflammatory cell death markers.CoQ10-micelles might usefully treat OA."
https://openalex.org/W4283374992,"Objective To understand healthcare worker and patient experience with peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) insertion in patients with difficult intravenous access (DIVA) including the use of ultrasound (US). Methods Descriptive study using 1-on-1 semi-structured interviews conducted between August 2020 and January 2021. Purposeful sampling was used to recruit healthcare practitioners (HCPs) and patients with DIVA who had PIVC experience. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Interview data were than mapped to the implementation theory Behaviour Change Wheel to inform implementation strategies. Results In total 78 interviews (13 patients; 65 HCPs) were completed with respondents from metropolitan (60%), regional (25%) and rural/remote (15%) settings across Australia. Thematic analysis revealed 4 major themes: i) Harmful patient experiences persist, with patient insights not leveraged to effect change; ii) ‘Escalation’ is just a word on the front lines; iii) Heightened risk of insertion failure without resources and training; and iv) Paving the way forward–‘measures need to be in place to prevent failed insertion attempts. Themes were mapped to the behaviour change wheel and implementation strategies developed, these included: staff education, e-health record for DIVA identification, DIVA standard of care and DIVA guidelines to support escalation and ultrasound use. Conclusion(s) DIVA patients continue to have poor healthcare experiences with PIVC insertion. There is poor standardisation of DIVA assessment, escalation, US use and clinician education across hospitals. Quality, safety, and education improvement opportunities exist to improve the patient with DIVA experience and prevent traumatic insertions. We identified a number of implementation strategies to support future ultrasound and DIVA pathway implementation."
https://openalex.org/W4283382063,"Maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase (MELK) regulates cell cycle progression and is highly expressed in many cancers. The molecular mechanism of MELK dysregulation has not been determined in aggressive forms of breast cancer, such as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To evaluate molecular markers of MELK aberrations in aggressive breast cancer, we assessed MELK gene amplification and expression in breast tumors. MELK mRNA expression is highly up-regulated in basal-like breast cancer (BLBC), the major molecular subtype of TNBC, compared to luminal or other subtypes of breast tumors. MELK copy number (CN) gains are significantly associated with BLBC, whereas no significant association of CpG site methylation or histone modifications with breast cancer subtypes was observed. Accordingly, the CN gains appear to contribute to an increase in MELK expression, with a significant correlation between mRNA expression and CN in breast tumors and cell lines. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays revealed that both nuclear and cytoplasmic staining scores of MELK were significantly higher in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tumors compared to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and normal breast tissues. Our data showed that upregulation of MELK in BLBC may be in part driven by CN gains, rather than epigenetic modifications, indicating a potential for overexpression and CN gains of MELK to be developed as a diagnostic and prognostic marker to identify patients who have more aggressive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4283387865,"Healthcare workers (HCWs), especially frontline workers against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), are considered to be risky because of occupational exposure to infected patients. This study evaluated the correlation between seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies among HCWs and the implementation of personal protective equipment (PPE) &amp; infection prevention and control (IPC). We recruited 1237 HCWs from nine public COVID-19-designated hospitals in Shiga Prefecture, central Japan, between 15–26 February 2021. All participants answered a self-administered questionnaire and provided blood samples to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. A total of 22 cases (1·78%) were seropositive among the 1237 study participants. An unavoidable outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 had occurred at the terminal care unit of one hospital, before identifying and securely isolating this cluster of cases. Excluding with this cluster, 0·68% of HCWs were suspected to have had previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. Binomial logistic regression from individual questionnaires and seropositivity predicted a significant correlation with N95 mask implementation under aerosol conditions (p = 8.63e -06 , aOR = 2.47) and work duration in a red zone (p = 2.61e -04 , aOR = 1.99). The institutional questionnaire suggested that IPC education was correlated with reduced seropositivity at hospitals. Seroprevalence and questionnaire analyses among HCWs indicated that secure implementation of PPE and re-education of IPC are essential to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection within healthcare facilities. Occupational infections from SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings could be prevented by adhering to adequate measures and appropriate use of PPE. With these measures securely implemented, HCWs should not be considered against as significantly risky or dirty by local communities."
https://openalex.org/W4283364522,"Jordan was the first Arab country to enact clinical research regulations. The country has a well-flourished pharmaceutical industry that leans heavily on clinical research (CR) for drug development and post-marketing surveillance. In this cross-sectional study, we sought to assess the public's awareness and attitude towards CR as well as their perceived motivators and barriers to CR participation. A population-based, self-administered questionnaire was distributed to the general public in Jordan. Among the 1061 participants in this survey, 74% reported being aware of CR. The majority (70%) agreed to the role of CR in health promotion. Online information and healthcare staff were the two main sources of CR information for the participants. About 25% of the participants received prior invitations to participate in CR with 21% agreeing to participate. However, most participants of the current study (63%) were willing to participate in future CR. Contributing to science, benefiting others, and promoting one's own health were the top motivating factors for participating in CR; while time constraints, fear of research procedure, and lack of interest were the most cited reasons for rejecting participation. Filling out questionnaire surveys, donating blood samples, and participating in physical examinations were the main CR contributions of the participants. Nearly 31% of the participants believed that CR is conducted in a responsible and ethical manner, while 57% did not have an opinion regarding the same matter. In addition, 49% and 44% were neutral with regards to the degree of harm and confidentiality posed by CR. While only 27% disagreed that CR exposes participants to some form of harm, 48% either strongly agreed (15%) or agreed (33%) that it maintains high level of confidentiality for participants. The current study provides insight into the public's perception of CR in Jordan as well as its motivating factors and perceived barriers towards participating in CR. We envisage to utilize this insight as an aid in the design of vigilant future awareness campaigns and recruitment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W4283367187,"Studies have outlined the negative consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic to psychological health. However, the potential within-individual diversity of experiences during COVID-19, and how such experiences relate to indices of psychological distress and COVID-19-specific stressors, remains to be explored. A large online sample of American MTurk Workers (N = 3,731; Mage = 39.54 years, SD = 13.12; 51.70% female) completed short assessments of psychological distress, COVID-19-specific stressors (e.g., wage loss, death), and seven items assessing negative and positive COVID-19 experiences. Latent profile analyses were used to identify underlying profiles of COVID-19 experiences. A four-profile solution was retained representing profiles that were: (1) predominantly positive (n = 839; 22.49%), (2) predominantly negative (n = 849; 22.76%), (3) moderately mixed (n = 1,748; 46.85%), and (4) high mixed (n = 295; 7.91%). The predominantly positive profile was associated with lower psychological distress, whereas both the predominantly negative and high mixed profiles were associated with higher psychological distress. Interestingly, specific COVID-19 stressful events were associated with the high mixed profile. The present study challenges the narrative that the impacts of COVID-19 have been unilaterally negative. Future directions for research are proposed."
https://openalex.org/W4283369094,"Slipped Capital Femoral Epiphysis (SCFE) is a skeletal pathology affecting adolescents which requires timely surgery to prevent progression. Delays in diagnosis and treatment of SCFE can negatively affect patient prognosis, and few studies have examined how health disparities and barriers to care may influence these delays. In particular, only a handful of studies have included a Hispanic patient sample, despite this ethnic group’s increased risk for the disease and unique barriers to care. A retrospective chart review was conducted for 124 patients surgically treated for idiopathic SCFE from January 2010 to September 2017. Patient data included age, facility and date of diagnosis, sex, BMI, race and ethnicity, Southwick slip angle, and insurance type. Results indicated that patients with private insurance were more likely to present with a mild slip than patients who were insured by Medicaid or uninsured, while patients without insurance were more likely to have severe slips. Patients without insurance also had a significantly higher mean slip than patients with insurance. The relationship between insurance status and slip angle degree was significant independent of race, even though Hispanic individuals were significantly more likely to have Medicaid or be uninsured. All patients without insurance, and a majority of those with Medicaid, were diagnosed in the emergency department. Time to diagnosis and slip angle were positively correlated, which suggests that longer delays led to increase of the slip angle, consistent with previous findings. Time to diagnosis and BMI were also correlated, which may be tied to socioeconomic factors, but the possibility of weight bias should not be dismissed. These results suggest that socioeconomic status and other factors may have contributed to barriers to care which led to delays in diagnosis and thus more severe slips. Future SCFE research should include health disparities variables to better inform treatment and prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W4283383843,"Concerns about research waste have fueled debate about incentivizing individual researchers and research institutions to conduct responsible research. We showed stakeholders a proof-of-principle dashboard with quantitative metrics of responsible research practices at University Medical Centers (UMCs). Our research question was: What are stakeholders' views on a dashboard that displays the adoption of responsible research practices on a UMC-level? We recruited stakeholders (UMC leadership, support staff, funders, and experts in responsible research) to participate in online interviews. We applied content analysis to understand what stakeholders considered the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the dashboard and its metrics. Twenty-eight international stakeholders participated in online interviews. Stakeholders considered the dashboard helpful in providing a baseline before designing interventions and appreciated the focus on concrete behaviors. Main weaknesses concerned the lack of an overall narrative justifying the choice of metrics. Stakeholders hoped the dashboard would be supplemented with other metrics in the future but feared that making the dashboard public might put UMCs in a bad light. Our findings furthermore suggest a need for discussion with stakeholders to develop an overarching framework for responsible research evaluation and to get research institutions on board."
https://openalex.org/W4283386425,"A number of pharmaceuticals have been identified as potential adjuvants to speech language therapy following stroke, but it is also important to consider which pharmaceuticals may result in a less robust recovery. Here we examine whether post-stroke language recovery was meaningfully impeded by cholinergic, GABAergic, or dopaminergic medications patients received. Eighty participants with left hemisphere stroke were examined retrospectively to see whether the use of one of these three classes of medication prior to admission for acute stroke, during their inpatient stay, or at discharge was associated with differences in recovery on three common measures of language. While prescription of any of the candidate drugs was relatively uncommon, groups were very well matched for many common factors that impact performance. When age, education, and acute lesion volume were controlled, there were no significant differences in performance among those taking cholinergic, GABAergic, or dopaminergic medications and those who were not. Those who experienced a ""good recovery"" of language (≥10% improvement on any one language measure over time) had similar exposure to these drugs to those with a poor recovery. This work represents a first look at these drug classes with regard to their effects on the recovery of language after stroke and should not be interpreted as resolving all potential for concern, but these results do offer modest reassurance that these common classes of pharmacotherapy, when given for short periods in this population, do not appear to have marked deleterious effects on post-stroke recovery of language."
https://openalex.org/W4283390253,"The presence of inter-limb asymmetries can influence strength performance and represent an injury risk factor for team sport athletes. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of changes in resistance loads using different assessment modalities on the magnitude and the direction of inter-limb asymmetry within the same leg. Fifteen young elite soccer players from the same professional academy performed rear-foot-elevated-split-squat-test at different loading conditions (body mass with no overload, 25% of body mass, 50% of body mass 50%), isokinetic knee flexor (concentric 30°·s -1 , concentric 60°·s -1 , eccentric 90°·s -1 ) and extensor (concentric 60°·s -1 , eccentric 60°·s -1 ). The outcomes from the agreement analyses suggested moderate level agreement between body mass vs body mass 25% (Kappa = 0.46), with no agreement or fair agreement for the other between-assessment comparison. Our results demonstrated that the magnitude and direction of within-limb strength imbalances were inconsistent when compared within the same assessment under different resistance load conditions."
https://openalex.org/W4283394461,"Objective The purposes of this study were to (1) detect the intra- and inter-reliabilities of the lumbar erector spinae stiffness by MyotonPRO among participants with chronic lower back pain (CLBP); (2) compare the muscle stiffness between pain and non-pain sides during different positions; (3) explore the correlation between intensity of pain and muscle stiffness. Design Twenty participants with CLBP were recruited and the stiffness measurements were carried out by two experienced physiotherapists (operators Ⅰ and Ⅱ). Each participant was evaluated by the operatorⅠ in different postures (static prone and sitting). After a 5-day interval, the same participant was reassessed by the operatorⅠ in the static prone posture. For the inter-rater reliability test, each participant was quantified by both operators once, with 30 minutes between the measurements on the same day. The intensity of pain was evaluated using a 0–10 visual analog scale (VAS). Results The intra- and inter-rater reliabilities were excellent (ICC = 0.88–0.99). The MDC values ranged from 25.03 to 86.26 N/m. Examples of Bland-Altman plots showed good agreement. The erector spinae stiffness on the painful sides was higher with a marked increase in the sitting position (P &lt; .05) when compared with the non-painful side. However, there was no significant difference in the prone position (P &gt; .05). The intensity of pain among adults with CLBP was not associated with muscle stiffness of the lumbar erector spinae muscle. Conclusions Our findings indicated that the MyotonPRO is a feasible device in quantifying the stiffness of the lumbar erector spinae muscle in patients with CLBP. Meanwhile, the erector spinae stiffness on the painful sides was higher in the sitting when compared with the non-painful side."
https://openalex.org/W4283397743,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a common disease with high morbidity and mortality, which can cause pathological, physiological, and biological reactions. SAH causes a series of responses such as neuronal and cerebral cortex damage, which in turn leads to inflammation and apoptosis. Traditional Chinese medicine has a strong anti-inflammatory effect, such as Alantolactone (ATL). However, studies on ATL therapy for SAH have not been reported. We observed the neurological scores, brain water content, Evans blue (EB) extravasation, neuroinflammation, and apoptosis via performing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and other methods after SAH. In this study, we found that ATL treatment attenuated the neurologic deficits, inhibited neuronal apoptosis and inflammatory reaction, promoted polarization of microglia toward the M2 phenotype, and activated the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. ATL can reduce the neurons and cerebral cortex damage of SAH rats through activating PI3K/Akt signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W4283446789,"Promoting healthy lifestyles is important to protect against obesity and non-communicable diseases. However, there is a lack of understanding of the enablers and barriers to healthy lifestyles (dietary and physical activity) among pre-service nursing trainees in Ghana. This study therefore aims to examine the perceived practice, enablers and barriers in adopting healthy dietary and physical activity behaviours.Cross-sectional qualitative, one-on-one in-depth interviews with a semi-structured guide were conducted with 16 nursing trainees (public health nursing) (aged: 18-25 years) in the School of Nursing and Midwifery, University of Health and Allied Sciences. Participants were selected based on body mass index (underweight, normal, over-weight, and obesity) classification of the world health organization. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Data analysis was manually carried out.Enablers and barriers were grouped into levels of individual (intrapersonal), social environment, physical environment, and university factors based on ecological model initially formulated by Bronfenbrenner's. Enablers to healthy dietary behaviour were self-discipline, dietary knowledge, social support, and access/availability. Enablers related to physical activity mentioned were body image, social support, and the existence of student societies. Barriers to healthy dietary behaviour included upbringing, preference, accessibility, safety/appearance, and studies/lectures. Barriers mentioned in relation to physical activity include a busy lifestyle, inadequate feeding, studies/academic activity, student societies, upbringing, and social support.A program to support healthy lifestyles for nursing trainees is needed. Specifically, in terms of developing and implementing interventions to overcome barriers and promote facilitators to adopt healthy dietary and physical activity behaviours whilst in training."
https://openalex.org/W4283361103,"Platelets enhance coagulation by exposing phosphatidylserine (PS) on their cell surface in response to strong agonist activation. Transient receptor potential channels, including TRPC6, have been implicated in the calcium influx central to this process. Here, we characterize the effect of a Trpc6 gain-of-function (GOF) disease-associated, and a dominant negative (DN), mutation on murine platelet activation. Platelets from mice harboring Trpc6 E896K/E896K (GOF) and Trpc6 DN/DN mutations were subject to in vitro analysis. Trpc6 E896K/E896K and Trpc6 DN/DN mutant platelets show enhanced and absent calcium influx, respectively, upon addition of the TRPC3/6 agonist GSK1702934A (GSK). GSK was sufficient to induce integrin αIIbβ3 activation, P-selection and PS exposure, talin cleavage, and MLC2 phosphorylation in Trpc6 E896K/E896K , but not in wild-type, platelets. Thrombin-induced calcium influx and PS exposure were enhanced, and clot retraction delayed, by GOF TRPC6, while no differences were noted between wild-type and Trpc6 DN/DN platelets. In contrast, Erk activation upon GSK treatment was absent in Trpc6 DN/DN , and enhanced in Trpc6 E896K/E896K , platelets, compared to wild-type. The positive allosteric modulator, TRPC6-PAM-C20, and fluoxetine maintained their ability to enhance and inhibit, respectively, GSK-mediated calcium influx in Trpc6 E896K/E896K platelets. The data demonstrate that gain-of-function mutant TRPC6 channel can enhance platelet activation, including PS exposure, while confirming that TRPC6 is not necessary for this process. Furthermore, the results suggest that Trpc6 GOF disease mutants do not simply increase wild-type TRPC6 responses, but can affect pathways not usually modulated by TRPC6 channel activity, displaying a true gain-of-function phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W4283362023,"A higher body mass index (BMI) has been associated with better survival among chronic kidney disease patients in some reports. However, more research is required to determine the associations between BMI and mortality in incident hemodialysis patients. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the association between mortality and BMI measured at the first hemodialysis session and 2 weeks after hemodialysis initiation in Japanese patients with incident hemodialysis.We retrospectively enrolled 266 adult patients with incident hemodialysis who were treated at our hospital between May 2013 and June 2019. The data on BMI was obtained at the first hemodialysis session and 2 weeks after hemodialysis initiation. Patients were divided into tertiles based on BMI [<18.5 (low), 18.5-23.9 (normal), and ≥24 (high) kg/m2]. The normal group was used as the reference group. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality.The mean age of patient was 68.9 ± 12.0 years, and the BMI was 23.3 ± 4.24 kg/m2 at the first hemodialysis session. The body mass index was 22.0 ± 3.80 kg/m2 at 2 weeks after hemodialysis initiation. During a mean follow-up of 3.89 ± 2.12 years, 80 (30.1%) deaths occurred. In multivariate analyses, low BMI at the first hemodialysis session was significantly associated with worse all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-5.03). At 2 weeks after hemodialysis initiation, high BMI was significantly associated with better all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 0.38; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.81).At 2 weeks after HD initiation, high BMI was associated with lower mortality in Japanese patients with incident hemodialysis."
https://openalex.org/W4283364418,"Reactive nitrogen species (RNS) play an important role in plant immunity as signaling factors. We previously developed a plasma technology to partially convert air molecules into dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5), an RNS whose physiological action is poorly understood. To reveal the function of N2O5 gas in plant immunity, Arabidopsis thaliana was exposed to plasma-generated N2O5 gas once (20 s) per day for 3 days, and inoculated with Botrytis cinerea, Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pst), or cucumber mosaic virus strain yellow (CMV(Y)) at 24 h after the final N2O5 gas exposure. Lesion size with B. cinerea infection was significantly (P < 0.05) reduced by exposure to N2O5 gas. Propagation of CMV(Y) was suppressed in plants exposed to N2O5 gas compared with plants exposed to the air control. However, proliferation of Pst in the N2O5-gas-exposed plants was almost the same as in the air control plants. These results suggested that N2O5 gas exposure could control plant disease depending on the type of pathogen. Furthermore, changes in gene expression at 24 h after the final N2O5 gas exposure were analyzed by RNA-Seq. Based on the gene ontology analysis, jasmonic acid and ethylene signaling pathways were activated by exposure of Arabidopsis plants to N2O5 gas. A time course experiment with qRT-PCR revealed that the mRNA expression of the transcription factor genes, WRKY25, WRKY26, WRKY33, and genes for tryptophan metabolic enzymes, CYP71A12, CYP71A13, PEN2, and PAD3, was transiently induced by exposure to N2O5 gas once for 20 s peaking at 1-3 h post-exposure. However, the expression of PDF1.2 was enhanced beginning from 6 h after exposure and its high expression was maintained until 24-48 h later. Thus, enhanced tryptophan metabolism leading to the synthesis of antimicrobial substances such as camalexin and antimicrobial peptides might have contributed to the N2O5-gas-induced disease resistance."
https://openalex.org/W4283365740,"Smart card data are widely used in generating the origin and destination (O–D) matrix for public transit, which contains important information for transportation planning and operation. However, the generation of the O–D matrix is limited by the smart card data information that includes the boarding (origin) information without the alighting (destination) information. To solve this problem, trip chain methods have been proposed, thereby greatly contributing in estimating the destination using the smart card data. Nevertheless, unlinked trips, that is, trips with unknown destinations, are a persisting issue. The purpose of this study is to develop a method for estimating the destination of unlinked trips, in which trip chain methods cannot be applied, using temporal travel patterns and historical boarding records of the passengers based on long-term smart card data. The passengers were clustered by k-means clustering, and the time-of-day travel patterns were estimated for each cluster using a Gaussian mixture model. The travel patterns were formulated to estimate the destination of the passengers from the smart card data. The proposed method was verified using the 2018 smart card data collected in Sejong City, South Korea. The existing trip chain method matched the destinations of 60.0% of the total trips, whereas the proposed method improved the matching to 74.9% by additionally matching the destinations of 37.2% of the unlinked trips."
https://openalex.org/W4283382371,"Meibography is becoming an integral part of dry eye diagnosis. Being objective and repeatable this imaging technique is used to guide treatment decisions and determine the disease status. Especially desirable is the possibility of automatic (or semi-automatic) analysis of a meibomian image for quantification of a particular gland's feature. Recent reports suggest that in addition to the measure of gland atrophy (quantified by the well-established ""drop-out area"" parameter), the gland's morphological changes may carry equally clinically useful information. Here we demonstrate the novel image analysis method providing detailed information on local deformation of meibomian gland pattern. The developed approach extracts from every Meibomian image a set of six morphometric color-coded maps, each visualizing spatial behavior of different morphometric parameter. A more detailed analysis of those maps was used to perform automatic classification of Meibomian glands images. The method for isolating individual morphometric components from the original meibomian image can be helpful in the diagnostic process. It may help clinicians to see in which part of the eyelid the disturbance is taking place and also to quantify it with a numerical value providing essential insight into Meibomian gland dysfunction pathophysiology."

We examined the critical trajectory of financial risk protection against out-of-pocket (OOP) health expenditure in Bangladesh.Using Bangladesh Household Income and Expenditure Survey data from 2005, 2010, and 2016, we examined the levels and distributions of catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and impoverishment incidences. We used the normative food, housing, and utilities method, refining it by categorizing households with zero OOP expenses by reasons.OOP expenditure doubled between 2005 and 2016 (USD 115.6 in 2005, USD 162.1 in 2010, USD 242.9 in 2016), accompanied by rising CHE (11.5% in 2005, 11.9% in 2010, 16.6% in 2016) and impoverishment incidence (1.5% in 2005, 1.6% in 2010, 2.3% in 2016). While further impoverishment of the poor households due to OOP expenditure (3.6% in 2005, 4.1% in 2010, 3.9% in 2016) was a more severe problem than impoverishment of the non-poor, around 5.5% of non-poor households were always at risk of impoverishment. The poorest households were the least financially protected throughout the study period (lowest vs. highest quintile CHE: 29.5% vs. 7.6%, 33.2% vs. 7.2%, and 37.6% vs. 13.0% in 2005, 2010, and 2016, respectively). The disparity in CHE among households with and without chronic illness was also remarkable in 2016 (25.0% vs. 9.1%).Financial risk protection in Bangladesh exhibits a deteriorated trajectory from 2005 to 2016, posing a significant challenge to achieving UHC and, thus, the SDGs by 2030. The poorest and chronically ill households disproportionately lacked financial protection. Reversing the worsening trends of CHE and impoverishment and addressing the inequities in their distributions calls for implementing UHC and thus providing financial protection against illness."
https://openalex.org/W4283361245,"Research on health and healthcare for asylum seekers and refugees (ASR) has focused strongly on accessibility and legal entitlements, with quality of care receiving little attention. This study aimed to assess responsiveness, as non-medical quality of care, in the narratives of ASR patients recently arrived in Germany.31 ASR with existing medical conditions were recruited in six refugee reception centres and three psychosocial centres. Semi-structured, qualitative interviews were conducted which reconstructed their patient journey after arrival in Germany. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and evaluated using thematic analysis.The experiences of participants throughout the patient journey provided a rich and varied description of the responsiveness of health services. Some dimensions of responsiveness, including respectful treatment, clear communication and trust, resurfaced throughout the narratives. These factors were prominent reasons for positive evaluations of the health system, and negative experiences were reported in their absence. Other dimensions, including cleanliness of facilities, autonomy of decision-making and choice of provider were raised seldomly. Positive experiences in Germany were often set in contrast to negative experiences in the participants' countries of origin or during transit. Furthermore, many participants evaluated their experience with healthcare services in terms of the perceived technical quality of medical care rather than with reference to responsiveness.This qualitative study among ASR analysed patient experiences to better understand responsiveness of care for this population. While our results show high overall satisfaction with health services in Germany, using the lens of responsiveness allowed us to identify particular policy areas where care can be strengthened further. These include in particular the expansion of high-quality interpreting services, provision of professional training to increase the competency of healthcare staff in caring for a diverse patient population, as well as an alignment between healthcare and asylum processes to promote continuity of care."
https://openalex.org/W4283377305,"Walkability is a term that describes various aspects of the built and social environment and has been associated with physical activity and public health. Walkability is subjective and although multiple definitions of walkability exist, there is no single agreed upon definition. Road networks are integral parts of mobility and should be an important part of walkability. However, using the road structure as nodes is not widely discussed in existing methods. Most walkability measures only provide area–based scores with low spatial resolution, have a one–size–fits–all approach, and do not consider individuals opinion. Active Living Feature Score (ALF–Score) is a network–based walkability measure that incorporates road network structures as a core component. It also utilizes user opinion to build a high–confidence ground–truth that is used in our machine learning pipeline to generate models capable of estimating walkability. We found combination of network features with road embedding and points of interest features creates a complimentary feature set enabling us to train our models with an accuracy of over 87% while maintaining a conversion consistency of over 98%. Our proposed approach outperforms existing measures by introducing a novel method to estimate walkability scores that are representative of users opinion with a high spatial resolution, for any point on the road."
https://openalex.org/W4283377526,"Diagnosing cardiac pauses that could produce syncopal episodes is important to guide appropriate therapy. However, the infrequent nature of these episodes can make detection challenging with conventional monitoring (CM) strategies with short-term ECG monitors. Insertable cardiac monitors (ICMs) continuously monitor for arrhythmias but present a higher up-front cost. It is not well understood whether these higher costs are offset by the costs of repeat evaluation in CM strategies. We simulated the likelihood of diagnostic success and cost-per-diagnosis of pause arrhythmias with CM strategies compared to ICM monitoring. ICM device data from syncope patients diagnosed with pause arrhythmias was utilized to simulate patient pathways and diagnostic success with CM. We assumed that detected true pause episodes (≥5 seconds) were symptomatic and prompted a hospital encounter and further evaluation with CM. Subsequent true pause episodes in yet-undiagnosed patients triggered additional rounds of CM. Costs of monitoring were accrued at each encounter and represent the U.S. payer perspective. Cost per diagnosed patient was calculated as the total costs accrued for all patients divided by the number of patients diagnosed, across 1,000 simulations. During a mean 505±333 days of monitoring ICM detected 2.4±2.7 pause events per patient, with an average of 109±94 days until the first event. CM was projected to diagnose between 13.8% (24-hour Holter) and 30.2% (two 30-day monitors) of the ICM-diagnosed patients. Total diagnostic costs per ICM-diagnosed patient averaged $7,847, whereas in the CM strategies average cost-per-diagnosis ranged from $12,950±2,589 with 24-hour Holter to $32,977±14,749 for two 30-day monitors. Relative to patients diagnosed with pause arrhythmias via ICM, CM strategies diagnose fewer patients and incur higher costs per diagnosed patient."
https://openalex.org/W4283378849,"Objective This case study examined implementation of the National Health Services Standards (NHSSs) as a continuous quality improvement (CQI) process at three church-based health facilities in Papua New Guinea. This process was designed to improve quality of care and accredit the level three health centers to level four as district hospitals to provide a higher level of care. The aims of the paper are to critically examine driving and restraining forces in CQI implementation and analyses how power influences agenda setting for change. Methods Semi-structured interviews were conducted with nine managers and eight health workers as well as three focus group discussions with health workers from three rural church-based health facilities in Morobe and Madang provinces. They included senior, mid-level and frontline managers and medical doctors, health extension officers, nursing officers and community health workers. Thematic analysis was used as an inductive and deductive process in which applied force field analysis, leadership-member exchange (LMX) theory and agenda setting was applied. Results Qualitative analysis showed how internal and external factors created urgency for change. The CQI process was designed as a collective process. Power relations operated at and between various levels: the facilities, which supported or undermined the change process; between management whereby the national management supported the quality improvement agenda, but the regional management exercised positional power in form of inaction. Theoretical analysis identified the ‘missing bit in the middle’ shaped by policy actors who exercise power over policy formulation and constrained financial and technical resources. Analysis revealed how to reduce restraining forces and build on driving forces to establish a new equilibrium. Conclusion Multiple theories contributed to the analysis showing how to resolve problematic power relations by building high-quality, effective communication of senior leadership with mid-level management and reactivated broad collaborative processes at the health facilities. Addressing the ‘missing bit in the middle’ by agenda setting can improve implementation of the NHSSs as a quality improvement process. The paper concludes with learning for policy makers, managers and health workers by highlighting to pay close attention to institutional power dynamics and practices."
https://openalex.org/W4283386262,"The FDA’s Accelerated Approval program (AA) is a regulatory program to expedite availability of products to treat serious or life-threatening illnesses that lack effective treatment alternatives. Ideally, all of the many stakeholders such as patients, physicians, regulators, and health technology assessment [HTA] agencies that are affected by AA should benefit from it. In practice, however, there is intense debate over whether evidence supporting AA is sufficient to meet the needs of the stakeholders who collectively bring an approved product into routine clinical care. As AAs have become more common, it becomes essential to be able to determine their impact objectively and reproducibly in a way that provides for consistent evaluation of therapeutic decision alternatives. We describe the basic features of an approach for evaluating AA impact that accommodates stakeholder-specific views about potential benefits, risks, and costs. The approach is based on a formal decision-analytic framework combining predictive distributions for therapeutic outcomes (efficacy and safety) based on statistical models that incorporate findings from AA trials with stakeholder assessments of various actions that might be taken. The framework described here provides a starting point for communicating the value of a treatment granted AA in the context of what is important to various stakeholders."

https://openalex.org/W4283397579,"The avian leukosis virus (ALV) is a serious threat to sustainable and economically viable commercial poultry management world-wide. Active infections can result in more than 20% flock loss, resulting in significant economic damage. ALV detection and elimination from flocks and breeding programs is complicated by high sequence variability and the presence of endogenous virus copies which show up as false positives in assays. Previously-developed approaches to virus detection are either too labor-intensive to implement on an industrial scale or suffer from high false negative or positive rates. We developed a novel multi-locus multiplex quantitative real-time PCR system to detect viruses belonging to the J and K genetic subgroups that are particularly prevalent in our region. We used this system to eradicate ALV from our broiler breeding program comprising thousands of individuals. Our approach can be generalized to other ALV subgroups and other highly genetically diverse pathogens."

A key element is the implementation of the adaptive shutter operation and of smart algorithms for real-time therapy monitoring. In the proof of concept study, these algorithms monitored the state of wearing position, the wearer's activity and the configured occlusion pattern. The average agreement of the detected states of wearing position was 72.6%. The average activity recognition match was 77.3%. The removal of the glasses was 100% correctly detected and the occlusion was 100% halted when active motion was recognized.The assembled smart shutter glasses for children are suitable for demonstrating the feasibility of continuous therapy monitoring by calculating wearing and occlusion times due to smart algorithms for wearing position detection, activity recognition, and occlusion monitoring.

This issue is relevant to the interpretation of tuberculosis (TB) vaccine trials based on prevention of infection.T-SPOT.TB assays were performed manually on healthy adolescents during a tuberculosis vaccine trial in Tanzania at 5 intervals over 3 years. Assay results were defined as negative, positive, borderline or invalid. Subsequently, microtiter plates were analyzed by an automated reader to obtain quantitative counts of spot forming cells (SFCs) for the present analysis.3387 T-SPOT.TB samples were analyzed from 928 adolescents; manual and automated assay results were 97% concordant. Based on the quantitative results 143 (15%) participants were prevalent IGRA-positives at baseline, were ineligible for further study. Among the remaining IGRA-negative participants, the annual rate of IGRA conversion was 2·9%. Among 43 IGRA converters with repeat assays 12 (28%) were persistent converters, 16 (37%) were transient converters, and 15 (35%) comprised a new category defined as irregular converters (≥2 different subsequent results). ESAT-6 and CFP-10 responses were higher in prevalent than incident positives: 53 vs 36 for CFP-10 (p < 0·007); 44 vs 34 for ESAT-6 (p = 0·12).Definitions of IGRA conversion, reversion, and persistence depend critically on the frequency of testing. Multiple shifts in categories among adolescents in a TB-endemic country may represent multiple infections, variable host responses in subclinical infection, or assay variation. These findings should to be considered in the design and interpretation of TB vaccine trials based on prevention of infection. Household contact studies could determine whether even transient IGRA conversion might represent exposure to an active case of M. tuberculosis disease."

Hydroxyurea oral liquids (100 mg/mL) were prepared using three different mixing methods (mortar, mixer or QuartetRx) from either bulk powder, capsule content, or whole capsules. Two brands of capsules were tested in this study. All formulations were stored at room temperature (25°C / 60% RH) in amber plastic bottles for 90 days and amber plastic syringes for 14 days. Physical stability was assessed visually, while chemical stability was evaluated using a stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatography method. Chemical derivatization with xanthydrol allowed the retention of hydroxyurea on a reverse-phase column. At least 93.9% and 97.0% of the initial concentration of hydroxyurea remained after 90 days in bottles and 14 days in syringes, respectively. There were no visual changes in formulations over the study period. Changes in pH up to 1.6 units were observed after 90 days of storage and were explained most likely by an ammonium generating degradation pathway. Ammonium was quantified and remained within safe levels in each HU 100 mg/mL oral preparations.

https://openalex.org/W4283448724,"Introduction Health professionals are on the front lines against the Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and are at high risk for acquiring the infection. Failures in precautionary measures, inadequacy/scarcity of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), and lack of social and family distancing may be associated with increased exposure and contamination by the new coronavirus. This study investigated the prevalence of COVID-19 among Brazilian health professionals and associated factors according to demographic and occupational characteristics. Methods A cross-sectional, analytical study was conducted using an online survey with 12,086 health professionals from all regions of Brazil. Data were collected using an adaptation of the respondent-driven sampling method for the virtual environment. The outcome variable was the diagnosis of COVID-19. Bivariate and multiple logistic regression analyzes were used to identify an association between the diagnosis of COVID-19 and demographic and occupational variables. Variables were considered statistically significant based on p&lt;0.05. Results Most participants were female, from the northeast region, and nursing professionals. A prevalence of 31.95% (95%CI: 31.0%, 32.9%) of COVID-19 was estimated. Following multiple regression analysis, the variables associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 among health professionals were: male gender, married individuals, professionals who provide care to patients with COVID-19, who work in a field hospital, and those who work in institutions that did not offer enough quality PPE. Conclusions The study found a high prevalence of COVID-19 infection, with male professionals being those with greater chances. Inadequate supply or poor quality of PPE offered by health institutions compromises the health of professionals with an increase in positive diagnosis for COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4283450838,"Deep learning techniques have recently been applied to analyze associations between gene expression data and disease phenotypes. However, there are concerns regarding the black box problem: it is difficult to interpret why the prediction results are obtained using deep learning models from model parameters. New methods have been proposed for interpreting deep learning model predictions but have not been applied to genetics. In this study, we demonstrated that applying SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to a deep learning model using graph convolutions of genetic pathways can provide pathway-level feature importance for classification prediction of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) gene expression subtypes. Using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, a graph convolutional network (GCN) model was implemented to construct graphs with nodes and edges. DLBCL datasets, including microarray gene expression data and clinical information on subtypes (germinal center B-cell-like type and activated B-cell-like type), were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus to evaluate the model. The GCN model showed an accuracy of 0.914, precision of 0.948, recall of 0.868, and F1 score of 0.906 in analysis of the classification performance for the test datasets. The pathways with high feature importance by SHAP included highly enriched pathways in the gene set enrichment analysis. Moreover, a logistic regression model with explanatory variables of genes in pathways with high feature importance showed good performance in predicting DLBCL subtypes. In conclusion, our GCN model for classifying DLBCL subtypes is useful for interpreting important regulatory pathways that contribute to the prediction."
https://openalex.org/W4283360976,"Background The present study aimed at validating the Malay-language version of the Behavioural Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire (BREQ-3M) using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Methods Data were collected from undergraduate students in the Health Campus, Universiti Sains Malaysia. A total of 674 students completed the BREQ-3M (male: 19.4%, female: 80.6%), with a mean age of 20.27 years (SD = 1.35). Behavioural regulation was assessed with the 24-item BREQ-3M. Standard forward-backward translation was performed to translate the English version of BREQ-3 into the Malay version. Results The initial measurement models tested did not result in a good fit for the data. Subsequent examination of the CFA results suggested some modifications, including adding correlations between the item residuals within the same subscale and deletion of identified regulation. These modifications resulted in good fit indices (Root Mean Square Error of Approximation, RMSEA = 0.049; Comparative Fit Index, CFI = 0.949; Tucker-Lewis Index, TLI = 0.938; Standardised Root Mean Square Residual, SRMR = 0.049). The final measurement model comprised 20 items and had significant factor loadings of more than 0.50, ranging from 0.580 to 0.868. The composite reliability ranged between 0.746–0.841 for the five-factor model. Conclusions The 20-item translated version of BREQ-3M is valid and reliable for assessing the behavioural regulation for exercise among university students in Malaysia. Perspective This study examined the psychometric properties of the Malay-language BREQ-3. It was the first to assess the measurement model in Malaysia using CFA."

The baseline predementia cohort registered from September 2015 to August 2017, with longitudinal follow-up in the History-based Artificial Intelligent Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System database, was retrospectively analyzed. The rates of conversion among the different EDVs were compared. Multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analyses were applied to study the influence of EDVs on progression. Age, education, sex, neuropsychological tests, activities of daily living, neuropsychiatric symptoms, parkinsonism, and multiple vascular risk factors were adjusted for. A total of 512 participants were analyzed, including 339 (66.2%) non-converters and 173 (33.8%) converters with a mean follow-up of 3.3 (range 0.4-6.1) and 2.8 (range 0.5-5.9) years, respectively. Compared to people without EDV (EDV 0), the hazard ratios for conversion to dementia were 3.6, 5.9, and 6.9 in those with EDV once (EDV 1), twice (EDV 2), and more than twice (EDV >2), respectively. In addition, older age, lower education, poorer cognition, poorer ADL performance, and longer follow-up periods also increased the conversion rates. EDVs in the predementia stages highly predict progression to dementia. Therefore, a sound public health as well as primary healthcare system that provide strategies for better management of mental and physical condition might help prevention of EDVs among older people in the predementia stages."
https://openalex.org/W4283368217,"With the development of economic globalization, the problem of unequal distribution of globalization dividends among and within countries has become increasingly serious, and reverse globalization has a great impact on the national economy and export trade. This paper uses the KOF Globalization Index and the world input-output tables in World Input-Output Database (WIOD), and empirically studies the transformation of a country’s export trade and export structure in the context of reverse globalization from the perspectives of world, country, industry, subdivided manufacturing and service industry. The results show that reverse globalization has a significant non-linear negative effect on economic development and export trade. Compared with developed and European Union (EU) countries, the exports of developing and non-EU countries are more affected by reverse globalization shocks. Reverse globalization has the greatest inhibition on the secondary industry exports, followed by the tertiary industry. The suppressive effects on the exports of 12 subdivided manufacturing and 14 subdivided service in China are significantly greater than that of the United States, but most of sub-industry exports in the United States are more sensitive. Besides, China’s exports of high-product-complexity industry such as metal products, medicinal chemicals, electrical and optical products and mechanical equipments are greatly affected by reverse globalization, while the exports of water transportation, construction, land transportation are relatively less restrained."
https://openalex.org/W4283380057,"Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited disorder of cholesterol metabolism. Current criteria for FH diagnosis, like Simon Broome (SB) criteria, lead to high false positive rates. The aim of this work was to explore alternative classification procedures for FH diagnosis, based on different biological and biochemical indicators. For this purpose, logistic regression (LR), naive Bayes classifier (NB), random forest (RF) and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) algorithms were combined with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), or threshold adjustment by maximizing Youden index (YI), and compared. Data was tested through a 10 × 10 repeated k-fold cross validation design. The LR model presented an overall better performance, as assessed by the areas under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) and precision-recall (AUPRC) curves, and several operating characteristics (OC), regardless of the strategy to cope with class imbalance. When adopting either data processing technique, significantly higher accuracy (Acc), G-mean and F1 score values were found for all classification algorithms, compared to SB criteria (p < 0.01), revealing a more balanced predictive ability for both classes, and higher effectiveness in classifying FH patients. Adjustment of the cut-off values through pre or post-processing methods revealed a considerable gain in sensitivity (Sens) values (p < 0.01). Although the performance of pre and post-processing strategies was similar, SMOTE does not cause model's parameters to loose interpretability. These results suggest a LR model combined with SMOTE can be an optimal approach to be used as a widespread screening tool."

The control group will receive general health recommendations and advice to perform unsupervised walking training. The primary outcome will be feasibility and acceptability outcomes. The secondary outcomes will be objective and subjective function capacity, quality of life, dietary quality, physical activity levels, sleep pattern, alcohol and tobacco use, mental wellbeing, and patients' activation. This pilot study will provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of home-based telehealth exercise and behavioural intervention delivered in socioeconomically deprived patients with PAD. In addition, the variance of the key health outcomes of this pilot study will be used to inform the sample size calculation for a future fully powered, multicentre randomized clinical trial."
https://openalex.org/W4283385356,"Item co-occurrence is an important pattern in recommendation. Due to the difference in correlation, the matching degrees between the target and historical items vary. The higher the matching degree, the greater probability they co-occur. Recently, the recommendation performance has been greatly improved by leveraging item relations. As an important bond imposed by relations, these connected items should have a strong correlation in the calculation of certain measures. This kind of correlation can be the biased knowledge that benefits parameter training. Specifically, we focus on tuples containing the target item and latest relational items that have relations such as complement or substitute with the target item in user's behavior sequence. Such close relations mean the matching degrees between relational items and historical items should be highly affected by that of the target item and historical items. For example, given a relational item having relation complement with the target item, if the target item has high matching degrees with some items in user's behavior sequence, this complementary item should behave similarly for the co-occurrence of complementary items. Under guidance of the above thought, in this work, we propose a target-relation regulated mechanism which converts the biased knowledge of high correlation of matching degrees into a regulation. It integrates the target item and relational items in history as a whole to characterize the matching score between the target item and historical items. Experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate that our model can significantly outperform a set of state-of-the-art models."
https://openalex.org/W4283396200,"Safranine O is widely used in the bioenergetics community as an indicator dye to determine membrane potentials and as an electron transfer mediator in potentiometric titrations. Here we show that two different commercial preparations of Safranine O contain less than sixty percent by weight of the title compound, with the rest primarily consisting of two closely related safranine isomers. All three major isomer components were isolated using reverse phase HPLC and their structures determined using mass spectrometry and two-dimensional NMR. These Safranines have two-electron midpoint potentials ranging from -272 to -315 mV vs. SHE. We have also investigated the absorption and fluorescence spectra of the compounds and found that they display distinct spectral and photophysical properties. While this mixture may aid in Safranine O's utility as a mediator compound, membrane potential measurements must take this range of dye potentials into account."
https://openalex.org/W4283399153,"This methodological survey aimed to verify whether there is concordance among several Cariogram different risk models at different thresholds, comparing both children and adult populations and how each risk/protective factor weight on the overall caries risk profile. Three groups’ data (two in children and one in adults) were obtained from previous studies, while a fourth, in young adults, was ad hoc enrolled. Different caries risk levels were assessed: a) three risk categories with two different thresholds as: “low risk” = 61–100% or 81–100% chance to avoid caries, “moderate risk” = 41–60% or 21–80% and “high risk” = 0–40% or 0–20%, named model 1 and 2; b) four risk categories with two different thresholds as: “low risk” = 61–100% or 76–100%, “moderate/low risk” = 41–60% or 51–75%; “moderate/high risk” = 21–40% or 26–50% and “high risk” = 0–20% or 0–25%, model 3 and 4; c) five risk categories as: “very low risk” = 81–100%; “low risk” = 61–80% “moderate risk” = 41–60%; “high risk” = 21–40% and “very high risk” = 0–20%, model 5. Concordance of the different Cariogram risk categories among the four groups was calculated using Cohen’s kappa. The weight of the association between all Cariogram models toward the Cariogram risk variables was evaluated by ordinal logistic regression models. Considering Cariogram model 1 and 2, Cohen’s Kappa values ranged from 0.40 (SE = 0.07) for the young adult group to 0.71 (SE = 0.05) for the adult one. Cohen’s Kappa values ranged from 0.14 (SE = 0.03 p&lt;0.01) for the adult group to 0.62 (SE = 0.02) for the two groups of children in models 3 and 4. Statistically significant associations were found for all Cariogram risk variables excepting Fluoride program in models 4 and 5 and the overall risk on children’s samples. Caries experience showed a quite variable weight in the different models in both adult groups. In the regression analyses, adult groups’ convergence was not always achievable since variations in associations between caries risk and different risk variables were narrower compared to other samples. Significant differences in caries risk stratification using different thresholds stands out from data analysis; consequently, risk assessments need to be carefully considered due to the risk of misleadingly choosing preventive and research actions."
https://openalex.org/W4283445888,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced colorectal cancer (CRC) screening programs to downscale their colonoscopy capacity. In this study, we assessed strategies to deal with temporary restricted colonoscopy capacity in a FIT-based CRC screening program while aiming to retain the maximum possible preventive effect of the screening program.We simulated the Dutch national CRC screening program inviting individuals between ages 55 and 75 for biennial FIT using the MISCAN-Colon model including the 3-month disruption in the first half of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the second half of 2020 and 2021, we simulated three different strategies for the total target population: 1) increasing the FIT cut-off, 2) skipping one screening for specific screening ages, and 3) extending the screening interval. We estimated the impact on required colonoscopy capacity in 2020-2021 and life years (LYs) lost in the long-term.Increasing the FIT cut-off, skipping screening ages and extending the screening interval resulted in a maximum reduction of 25,100 (-17.0%), 16,100(-10.9%) and 19,000 (-12.9%) colonoscopies, respectively. Modelling an increased FIT cut-off, the number of LYs lost ranged between 1,400 and 4,400. Skipping just a single screening age resulted in approximately 2,700 LYs lost and this was doubled in case of skipping two screening ages. Extending the screening interval up to 34 months had the smallest impact on LYs lost (up to 1,100 LYs lost).This modelling study shows that to anticipate on restricted colonoscopy capacity, temporarily extending the screening interval retains the maximum possible preventive effect of the CRC screening program."
https://openalex.org/W4283455916,"To evaluate the effect of blood donation before pregnancy on neonatal birth weight.A total of 14996 women with singleton pregnancies at full-term in Ningbo Medical Center Lihuili Hospital and Ningbo Women's and Children's Hospital from November 2019 to November 2020 were enrolled in this study. Detailed records of whole blood donation before pregnancy were obtained through Alipay software. The records were classified into three groups: nondonors, low-frequency donors and high-frequency donors according to the total numbers of blood donations in the 3-year period before pregnancy. The demographics and clinical information of the enrolled participants and their fetuses were collected from electronic medical records (EMRs). The effect of blood donations in the 3-year period before pregnancy on neonatal birth weight was analyzed.There was no significant difference in neonatal birth weight among the three groups (P = 0.373). In line with this, there was no association between the number of blood donations in the 3-year period before pregnancy and neonatal birth weight (β = 14.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.9, 31.4; P = 0.094) in the bootstrapped multivariate linear regression analysis models, adjusted for maternal age, number of pregnancies, number of deliveries, gestational age, mode of delivery, years of education and blood type in pregnant women. Compared to the nondonors, the risk of fetal macrosomia was higher in both low-frequency donors and all donors (OR: 1.539, 95% CI: 1.058, 2.134, P = 0.016; OR: 1.454, 95% CI: 1.033, 1.952, P = 0.021, respectively), in the bootstrapped binary logistic regression analysis models after adjusting for the variables mentioned above.Our study showed that maternal blood donation in the 3-year period before pregnancy may not lead to a reduction in neonatal birth weight, but may be associated with the incidence of fetal macrosomia."
https://openalex.org/W4283460465,"Analyzing the primary factors of potential evapotranspiration (PET) dynamic is fundamental to accurately estimating crop yield, evaluating environmental impacts, and understanding water and carbon cycles. Previous studies have focused on regionally average regional PET and its dominant factors. Spatial distributions of PET trends and their main causes have not been fully investigated. The Mann-Kendall test was used to determine the significance of long-term trends in PET and five meteorological factors (net radiation, wind speed, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, relative humidity) at 56 meteorological stations in the Sichuan-Chongqing region from 1970 to 2020. Furthermore, this present study combining and quantitatively illustrated sensitivities and contributions of the meteorological factors to change in annual and seasonal PET. There was a positive trend in PET for approximately 58%, 68%, 38%, 73% and 73% of all surveyed stations at annual, spring, summer, autumn and winter, respectively. Contribution analysis exhibited that the driving factors for the PET variation varied spatially and seasonally. For stations with an upward PET trend, vapor pressure deficit was a dominant factor at all time scales. For stations with a downward PET trend, annual changes in PET mainly resulted from decreased wind speed, as did changes in spring, autumn and winter; decreasing net radiation was the dominant factor in summer. The positive effect of the vapor pressure deficit offset the negative effects of wind speed and net radiation, leading to the increasing PET in this area as a whole. Sensitivity analysis showed that net radiation and relative humidity were the two most sensitive variables for PET, followed by vapor pressure deficit in this study area. Results from the two mathematical approaches were not perfect match, because the change magnitude of the meteorological factors is also responsible for the effects of meteorological factors on PET variation to some extent. However, conducting sensitivity and contribution analysis in this study can avoid the uncertainties from using a single method and provides detailed and well-understood information for interpreting the influence of global climate change on the water cycle and improving local water management."
https://openalex.org/W4283466651,"The plant genus Oenothera has played an important role in the study of plant evolution of genomes and plant defense and reproduction. Here, we build on the 1kp transcriptomic dataset by creating 44 new transcriptomes and analyzing a total of 63 transcriptomes to present a large-scale comparative study across 29 Oenothera species. Our dataset included 30.4 million reads per individual and 2.3 million transcripts on average. We used this transcriptome resource to examine genome-wide evolutionary patterns and functional diversification by searching for orthologous genes and performed gene family evolution analysis. We found wide heterogeneity in gene family evolution across the genus, with section Oenothera exhibiting the most pronounced evolutionary changes. Overall, more significant gene family expansions occurred than contractions. We also analyzed the molecular evolution of phenolic metabolism by retrieving proteins annotated for phenolic enzymatic complexes. We identified 1,568 phenolic genes arranged into 83 multigene families that varied widely across the genus. All taxa experienced rapid phenolic evolution (fast rate of genomic turnover) involving 33 gene families, which exhibited large expansions, gaining about 2-fold more genes than they lost. Upstream enzymes phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and 4-coumaroyl: CoA ligase (4CL) accounted for most of the significant expansions and contractions. Our results suggest that adaptive and neutral evolutionary processes have contributed to Oenothera diversification and rapid gene family evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4283466747,"The preventive effects of regular exercise on obesity-related health problems are carried over to the non-exercise detraining period, even when physical activity decreases with aging. However, it remains unknown whether regular childhood exercises can be carried over to adulthood. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effects of long-term childhood exercise and detraining on lipid accumulation in organs to prevent obesity in adulthood. Four-week-old male Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats were used as obese animals. OLETF rats were allocated into sedentary and exercise groups: exercise from 4- to 12-week-old and detraining from 12- to 20-week-old. At 12-week-old immediately after the exercise period, regular exercise completely inhibited hyperphagia, obesity, enlarged pancreatic islets, lipid accumulation and lobular inflammation in the liver, hypertrophied adipocytes in the white adipose tissue (WAT), and brown adipose tissue (BAT) whitening in OLETF rats. Additionally, exercise attenuated the decrease in the ratio of muscle wet weight to body weight associated with obesity. Decreased food consumption was maintained during the detraining period, which inhibited obesity and diabetes at 20-week-old after the detraining period. Histologically, childhood exercise inhibited the enlargement of pancreatic islets after the detraining period. In addition, inhibition of lipid accumulation was completely maintained in the WAT and BAT after the detraining period. However, the effectiveness was only partially successful in lipid accumulation and inflammation in the liver. The ratio of muscle wet weight to body weight was maintained after detraining. In conclusion, early long-term regular exercise effectively prevents obesity and diabetes in childhood, and its effectiveness can be tracked later in life. The present study suggests the importance of exercise during childhood and adolescence to inhibit hyperphagia-induced lipid accumulation in metabolic-related organs in adulthood despite exercise cessation."
