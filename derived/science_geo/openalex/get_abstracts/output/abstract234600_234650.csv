Three years of laboratory culture of Ancylus fluviati, lis Muller have shown that this species has a higher percentage of abnormalities (20%) in the than any other species examined. The frequency of the different kinds of abnormal and egg cells is shown in Table 1. Most common in all three years are dwarf eggs, smaller than ordinary size (1.42x1.20 mm). Dwarf may be a phenomenon definitely connected with the starting or stopping of oviposition. In both series of eggs, those throughout the egg-laying period and those in a single capsule, dwarf are found mainly at the end of each series, but partly at the beginning. The percentages in which they occur in different positions within the capsules are given in Table 2. The considerable number of dwarf and other irregularities given in Table 1 also make Ancylus fluviatilis Muller an interesting subject for studies of the earliest phases of embryonic development. Even when still in ovo the embryos may meet with various influences that interfere with their normal development-e.g., variations in the quantity of albumen, crowding because of abnormal development of a neighboring embryo or accidental formation of nurse eggs (competition), or abnormal development of the egg cell itself, determined by intrinsic factors (e.g., lack of fertilization) or extrinsic factors (e.g., crushing of the egg cell during the formation of the capsule). The advantages of the egg capsules of Ancylus fluviatilis Muller as experimental material can be summarized as follows. The limpet is a suitable animal for studying oviposition and embryogenesis under laboratory conditions. The apparatus described makes it possible to obtain living eggs, laid in transparent capsules, for microscopic investigation of living preparations. The capsule is easily turned, and the can be studied in series exactly in the order in which they were laid. The frequency of abnormalities of several sorts in the make the capsules particularly well suited for studies of cell physiology and other aspects of experimental biology."

From such a fistula, these workers were able to recover as much as 60 per cent of the fat of an ingested meal. Such a high recovery was not observed by later investigators in animal experiments. Eckstein, working with dogs fed emulsified olive oil, reported recoveries in thoracic duct lymph as high as 21 per cent in 12 hours, and 17 per cent in 6 hours (2). When he fed the dogs oleic and pahnitic acids, the recoveries were much lower. Since the dogs were anesthetized throughout the entire period of lymph collection, Eckstein was careful to point out that he did not expect fat absorption to be as good as it would have been under more normal conditions. Such low recoveries of absorbed fat in thoracic duct lymph of the dog were also observed by Little and Robinson (3). The availability of C14-labeled fatty acids, together with the development by Bolhnan et al. (4) of a method for collecting lymph from the ununesthetized rat, made possible a reinvestigation of this problem."
