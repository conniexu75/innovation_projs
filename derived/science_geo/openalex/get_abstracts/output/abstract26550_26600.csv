https://openalex.org/W2013136213,"Activating mutations of p53 promote tumor progression. The mutant protein adopts a characteristic conformation, which lacks the growth suppressor function of wild-type p53. We show that mutant p53 can drive cotranslated wild-type p53 into the mutant conformation: a similar effect in vivo would block wild-type suppressor function with dominant negative effect. The cotranslational effect of mutant p53 on wild-type conformation depends upon interaction between nascent polypeptides and oligomerization of the full-length proteins. We also show that oligomers of p53 proteins can be induced to change conformation in a cooperative manner. Cell growth stimulation induces a similar conformational change in p53, and our present results indicate that this may involve allosteric regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2017920584,"When quiescent cells are stimulated with growth factors, phorbol esters, okadaic acid, or protein synthesis inhibitors, the early-response genes, which include c-fos and c-jun, are rapidly induced. The earliest growth factor- and phorbol ester-stimulated nuclear signaling events concomitant with proto-oncogene induction are the rapid phosphorylation of two chromatin-associated proteins, pp33 and pp15. We show here that the tumor promoter okadaic acid, which inhibits protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, and the protein synthesis inhibitors anisomycin and cycloheximide also stimulate pp33 and pp15 phosphorylation. Using transcriptional inhibitors, we show that this response is not a consequence of early gene induction. By peptide mapping and microsequencing, chromatin-associated pp15 is identified as histone H3. Upon stimulation, histone H3 is rapidly phosphorylated on serine residues within its highly charged, basic N-terminal domain. Thus, these diverse agents elicit a common early nuclear signal modulating nucleosomal structure or function, potentially contributing to conformational regulation of proto-oncogene induction."
https://openalex.org/W2068681052,"The CLN1, CLN2, and CLN3 genes of S. cerevisiae form a redundant family essential for the G1-to-S phase transition. CLN1 and CLN2 mRNAs were previously shown to be negatively regulated by mating pheromone and by cell cycle progression out of G1, whereas CLN3 mRNA is not. The CLN3-2 (DAF1-1) allele prevents both cell cycle arrest and the turnoff of CLN1 and CLN2 mRNAs in response to mating pheromone, but only in the presence of an active CDC28 gene. An internally deleted nonfunctional cln2 gene was used as a reporter gene to demonstrate that in the absence of mating pheromone, efficient expression of cln2 mRNA requires both an active CDC28 gene and at least one functional CLN gene. mRNA from a nonfunctional cln1 gene was regulated similarly. Thus, CLN function and CDC28 activity jointly stimulate CLN1 and CLN2 mRNA levels, potentially forming a positive feedback loop for CLN1 and CLN2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W1626021976,"The human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) facilitates the exchange of neutral lipids among lipoproteins. In order to evaluate the effects of increased plasma CETP on lipoprotein levels, a human CETP minigene was placed under the control of the mouse metallothionein-I promoter and used to develop transgenic mice. Integration of the human CETP transgene into the mouse genome resulted in the production of active plasma CETP. Zinc induction of CETP transgene expression caused depression of serum cholesterol due to a significant reduction of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. There was no change in total cholesterol content in very low and low density lipoproteins. However, there was a decrease in the free cholesterol/cholesteryl ester ratio in plasma and in all lipoprotein fractions of transgenic mouse plasma, suggesting stimulation of plasma cholesterol esterification. The results suggest that high levels of plasma CETP activity may be a cause of reduced high density lipoproteins in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1601454315,"Proteoglycans (PGs) comprise a group of extracellular matrix macromolecules which play an important role in matrix biology. In this study, normal human skin and gingival fibroblast cultures were incubated with transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1), and the expression of three PGs, viz. biglycan (PGI), decorin (PGII), and versican (a large fibroblast proteoglycan) was examined. The results indicate that TGF-beta 1 (5 ng/ml) markedly increased the expression of biglycan (up to 24-fold) and versican (up to 6-fold) mRNAs and the enhancement of biglycan expression was coordinate with elevated type I procollagen gene expression in the same cultures. In contrast, the expression of decorin mRNA was markedly (up to approximately 70%) inhibited by TGF-beta 1. The response to TGF-beta 1 was similar in both skin and gingival fibroblasts, although the gingival cells were clearly more responsive to stimulation by TGF-beta 1 with respect to biglycan gene expression. Analysis of 35S-labeled proteoglycans in the culture media of skin and gingival fibroblasts also revealed stimulation of biglycan and versican production, and reduction in decorin production. Quantitation of both [35S]sulfate and [3H]leucine-labeled decorin in cell culture media by immunoprecipitation revealed a 50% reduction in decorin production in cell cultures treated with TGF-beta 1. This TGF-beta 1-elicited reduction was accompanied by an apparent increase in the size of the decorin molecules, although the size of the core protein was not altered, as judged by Western immunoblotting following chondroitinase ABC digestion. Analysis of the proteoglycans in the matrix and membrane fractions also revealed increased amounts of versican in cultures treated with TGF-beta 1. These results indicate differential regulation of PG gene expression in fibroblasts by TGF-beta 1, and these observations emphasize the role of PGs in the extracellular matrix biology and pathology."
https://openalex.org/W1486569222,"Neutrophil-activating peptide 1/interleukin 8 (NAP-1/IL-8), neutrophil-activating peptide 2 (NAP-2), and gro/melanoma growth-stimulatory activity (gro/MGSA) are potent inflammatory cytokines with homologous structure and similar neutrophil-activating properties. Receptors on human neutrophils that interact with these peptides were studied. Analysis of 125I-NAP-1/IL-8 binding at 0-4 degrees C revealed 64,500 +/- 14,000 receptors/cell with an apparent Kd of 0.18 +/- 0.07 nM (mean +/- S.D. of six independent experiments). Unlabeled NAP-1/IL-8, NAP-2, and gro/MGSA competed with 125I-NAP-1/IL-8 for binding to human neutrophils. Competition with increasing concentrations of unlabeled NAP-2 and gro/MGSA resolved two classes of NAP-1/IL-8 binding sites: about 70% of them bound NAP-2 and gro/MGSA with high affinity (Kd: 0.34 +/- 0.2 and 0.14 +/- 0.02), while 30% were of low affinity (Kd: 100 +/- 20 and 130 +/- 10 nM). Different binding sites, however, were not apparent upon competition with unlabeled NAP-1/IL-8, suggesting that both classes of receptors have similar affinities for NAP-1/IL-8. The existence of two receptors was also suggested by ligand cross-linking and cross-desensitization experiments. Two neutrophil membrane proteins with apparent Mr of 66,000-74,000 and 42,000-46,000 became cross-linked to 125I-NAP-1/IL-8, and the labeling was decreased when excess NAP-1/IL-8, NAP-2, or gro/MGSA was present. Stimulation of neutrophils with NAP-1/IL-8 resulted in desensitization toward a subsequent challenge with NAP-2 or gro/MGSA as shown by the rise in cytosolic free calcium. By contrast, following primary stimulation with NAP-2 or gro/MGSA, responses to NAP-1/IL-8 were only moderately attenuated, supporting the existence of NAP-1/IL-8 receptors which bind NAP-2 or gro/MGSA with low affinity. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that NAP-2 and gro/MGSA act upon human neutrophils by directly interacting with two classes of receptors for NAP-1/IL-8."
https://openalex.org/W1607745865,"The protein farnesyltransferase purified from rat brain contains two nonidentical subunits, alpha and beta. The holoenzyme forms a stable complex with [3H]farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) that can be isolated by gel filtration. The [3H]FPP is not covalently bound to the enzyme; it is released unaltered when the enzyme is denatured. When incubated with an acceptor such as p21H-ras, the complex transfers [3H]farnesyl from the bound [3H]FPP to the ras protein. This transfer is not sensitive to dilution by unbound FPP, suggesting that the [3H]FPP is bound at a site that leads to direct transfer to the p21H-ras acceptor. Cross-linking studies show that the p21H-ras binds to the lower molecular weight subunit (beta-subunit), raising the possibility that the [3H]FPP binds to the alpha-subunit. If this suggestion can be confirmed, it would invoke a reaction mechanism in which the alpha-subunit acts as a prenyl pyrophosphate carrier that delivers FPP to p21H-ras which is bound to the beta-subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1974263371,"In S. cerevisiae, ribosomal protein L32 regulates the splicing of the transcript of its own gene, RPL32. We have identified an RNA structure within the transcript that is responsible for this regulation. Initial deletions limited essential sequences to the 5' exon and the first few nucleotides of the intron. To take advantage of phylogenetic comparison of RNA structures, RPL32 was cloned from the closely related species, Kluyveromyces lactis. The splicing of its transcript is similarly regulated. Sequences conserved between the S. cerevisiae and K. lactis transcripts suggested a structure involving base pairing of a region encompassing the 5' splice site with another near the 5' end of the transcript. Analysis of numerous site-directed mutations supports this structure. We infer that stabilization of this structure by L32 inhibits splicing by precluding the interaction of U1 RNA with the 5' splice site."
https://openalex.org/W1539202010,"Extracellular signals produced by Rhizobium meliloti are able to induce root hair deformations and nodule organogenesis on alfalfa. The production of these signals is controlled by bacterial nod genes. To enable their isolation in significant amounts, an overproducting strain was constructed. These Nod factors were first extracted by butanol from the culture medium and further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, ion-exchange, and Sephadex LH-20 chromatographies. The structure of the major signal, called NodRm-1, was determined by mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, 35S labeling, chemical analysis, and enzymatic degradation, and was shown to be a sulfated and acylated tetramer of glucosamine namely, beta-D-GlcpN(2,9-hexadecadie-noyl) - (1—-4) - beta - D - Glc p Nac - (1—-4) - beta - D - Glc p NAc - (1—-4) - D - GlcpNAc-6-SO3H. Another Nod factor (called Ac-NodRm-1) was co-purified and identified as NodRm-1 acetylated on the C-6 of the nonreducing end sugar. NodRm-1 elicits root hair deformation specifically on alfalfa at a concentration less than 10(-10) M but has no effect on vetch (a heterologous host plant)."
https://openalex.org/W1605230574,"A human cytochrome P-450 with aldosterone synthase activity was purified from the mitochondria of an aldosterone-producing adenoma. It was recognized by an anti-bovine cytochrome P-450(11 beta) IgG and by a specific antibody raised against a portion of the CYP11B2 gene product, one of the two putative proteins encoded by human cytochrome P-450(11 beta)-related genes (Mornet, E., Dupont, J., Vitek, A., and White, P. C. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 20961-20967). A similar and probably the same aldosterone synthase cytochrome P-450 was detected in the adrenal of a patient with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism. These aldosterone synthases were distinguishable from cytochrome P-450(11 beta), the product of another cytochrome P-450(11 beta)-related gene, i.e. CYP11B1, by their catalytic, molecular, and immunological properties and also by their localization. The latter enzyme was unable to produce aldosterone and did not react with the specific antibody against the CYP11B2 gene product. It was present both in tumor and non-tumor portions of the adrenals carrying the adenoma and in normal adrenal cortex. On the other hand, aldosterone synthase cytochrome P-450 localized in the tumor portions of the adrenals or in the adrenal of a patient with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism. Thus aldosterone synthase cytochrome P-450, a distinct species from cytochrome P-450(11 beta), is responsible for the biosynthesis of aldosterone in the human, at least in patients suffering from primary aldosteronism."
https://openalex.org/W1481722459,"We have cloned the human genes coding for desmosomal glycoproteins DGII and DGIII, found in desmosomal cell junctions, and sequencing shows that they are related to the cadherin family of cell adhesion molecules. Thus a new super family of cadherin-like molecules exists which also includes the other major desmosomal glycoprotein, DGI (Wheeler, G. N., Parker, A. E., Thomas, C. L., Ataliotis, P., Poynter, D., Arnemann, J., Rutman, A. J., Pidsley, S. C., Watt, F. M., Rees, D. A., Buxton, R. S., and Magee, A. I. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., in press). DGIII differs from DGII by the addition of a 46-base pair exon containing an in-frame stop codon resulting in mature protein molecular weights of 84,633 for DGII and 78,447 for DGIII. The unique carboxyl-terminal region of DGII contains a potential serine phosphorylation site explaining why only DGII is phosphorylated on serine. The cadherin cell adhesion recognition sequence (His-Ala-Val) is replaced by Phe-Ala-Thr, suggesting that DGII/III may be adhesive molecules using a different mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2145107559,"By screening approximately 10(6) plaques in a wheat DNA library with a full-length germin cDNA probe, two genomic clones were detected. When digested with EcoRI, one clone yielded a 2.8-kilobase pair fragment (gf-2.8) and the other yielded a 3.8-kilobase pair fragment (gf-3.8). By nucleotide sequencing, each of gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 was found to encode a complete sequence for germin and germin mRNA, and to contain appreciable amounts of 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences. The cap site in gf-2.8 was determined by primer extension and the corresponding site in gf-3.8 was deduced by analogy. The mRNA coding sequences in gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 are intronless and 87% homologous with one another. The 5'-flanking regions in gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 contain recognizable sites of what are probably cis-acting elements but there is otherwise little if any significant similarity between them. In addition to putative TATA and CAAT boxes in the 5'-flanking regions of gf-2.8 and gf-3.8, there are AT-rich inverted-repeats, GC boxes, long purine-rich sequences, two 19-base pair direct-repeat sequences in gf-2.8, and a remarkably long (200-base pair) inverted-repeat sequence (approximately 90% homology) in gf-3.8. An 8% difference between the mature-protein coding regions in gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 is reflected by a corresponding 7% difference between the corresponding 201-residue proteins. Most significantly, the same 8% difference between the mature-protein coding regions in gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 is allied with no change whatever in a central part (61-151) of the encoded polypeptide sequences. It seems likely that this central, strongly conserved core in the germins is of first importance in the biochemical involvements of the proteins. When an equivalence is assumed between like amino acids, the gf-2.8 and gf-3.8 germins show significant (approximately 44%) similarity to spherulins 1a and 1b of Physarum polycephalum, a similarity that increases to approximately 50% in the conserved core of germin. Near the middle (87-96) of the conserved core in the germins is a rare PH(I/T)HPRATEI decapeptide sequence which is shared by spherulins (1a and 1b) and germins (gf-2.8 and gf-3.8). These similarities are discussed in the context of evidence which can be interpreted to suggest that the biochemistry of germins and spherulins is involved with cellular, perhaps cell-wall responses to desiccation, hydration, and osmotic stress.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W2152116912,"A cDNA clone for the nitrate/nitrite-inducible cytochrome P-450 (P-450) of the fungus Fusarium oxysporum (tentatively termed P-450dNIR) was isolated by an immunoscreening method. Sequence determination revealed a polypeptide of 403 amimo acid residues (Mr = 44,371), which was shown to contain the full-length sequence of the fungal P-450. The amino terminus region of the predicted sequence contained neither the signal-like, hydrophobic domain that is commonly observed in microsomal P-450s nor the tagging prosequence that is essential for localization of mitochondrial P-450s. Further, the sequence exhibited higher homologies against those of soluble bacterial P-450s, in particular P-450s of Streptomyces, rather than those of eukaryotic P-450s including yeast and fungal P-450s. These results are highly indicative that P-450dNIR is the first soluble P-450 derived from eukaryotic organisms. The unique features might be related to the novel function of P-450dNIR, which is involved in a dissimilatory reduction of nitrite by the fungus. P-450dNIR was classified into a new family, P-450LV, and the corresponding gene of the fungus was named CYP55."
https://openalex.org/W1516538526,"We have carried out experiments to determine the role of the cysteines in the hormone-binding domain (HBD) of the human estrogen receptor (ER) in receptor function. In each mutant receptor, 1 of the 4 cysteines in the HBD (cysteines 381, 417, 447, and 530) was changed by in vitro mutagenesis of the ER cDNA (containing Gly400) from cysteine to alanine; Cys530 was also mutated to a serine. The mutant and wild-type receptor cDNAs were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells using an expression vector containing the Rous sarcoma virus promoter. The mutant and wild-type receptors were assayed for hormone binding and for their ability to activate estrogen-responsive reporter plasmids. All ER mutants bound estradiol (E2) with affinity similar to wild-type ER, displaying a Kd between 0.3 and 0.8 nM (wild-type ER Kd = 0.45 +/- 0.10 nM). All were capable of covalent labeling by the affinity ligands ketononestrol aziridine, an estrogen agonist, and tamoxifen aziridine, an antagonist. Since in previous work we identified Cys530 as the site of covalent attachment of these ligands (Harlow, K.W., Smith, D.N., Katzenellenbogen, J.A., Greene, G.L., and Katzenellenbogen, B.S. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 17476-17485) it appears that an alternate residue(s) can be labeled in the absence of a cysteine at position 530; studies with methyl methanethiosulfonate, a cysteine-specific reagent, suggest that this residue is probably another cysteine in the HBD. The C381A, C417A, C530A and C530S ERs showed E2-stimulated transcriptional activation profiles similar to wild-type ER whereas the dose response for E2 for the C447A mutant was shifted to the right, requiring 50 x higher E2 concentrations to achieve half-maximal response. Tamoxifen aziridine inhibited E2-stimulated transcription, and ketononestrol aziridine stimulated transcription by wild-type, C530A, and C530S ER, but the effectiveness of these covalently attaching ligands was altered in the C530A and C530S mutants. Thus, these two mutant receptors are altered in their transactivation response to agonist and antagonist affinity labeling ligands but are unaltered in their response to reversibly binding estrogens and antiestrogens. In addition, we show that a mutant ER (C447A) can have an affinity for E2 similar to that of wild-type ER but differs in its ability to activate transcription in response to E2, indicating a decoupling of the hormone binding and transcriptional activation functions in this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1533980379,"Bradykinin (BK) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) both stimulate the hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in human fibroblasts, resulting in the formation of phosphatidic acid (PA) and diacylglycerol (DG) (Van Blitterswijk, W.J., Hilkmann, H., de Widt, J., and Van der Bend, R.L. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 10337-10343). Stimulation with BK resulted in the rapid and synchronous formation of [3H]choline and [3H]myristoyl-PA from the correspondingly prelabeled PC, indicative of phospholipase D (PLD) activity. In the presence of ethanol or n-butanol, transphosphatidylation by PLD resulted in the formation of [3H]phosphatidylethanol or - butanol, respectively, at the cost of PA and DG formation. This suggests that PC-derived DG is generated via a PLD/PA phosphohydrolase pathway. A more pronounced but delayed formation of these products was observed by PMA stimulation. The Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin also activated PLD and accelerated (synergized) the response to PMA. Both [3H] choline and [3H]phosphocholine were released into the extracellular medium in a time- and stimulus-dependent fashion, without apparent changes in the high intracellular levels of [3H]phosphocholine. The protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors staurosporin and 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methylglycerol inhibited BK- and PMA-induced activation of PLD. Down-regulation of PKC by long-term pretreatment of cells with phorbol ester caused a dramatic drop in background [3H]choline levels, while subsequent stimulation with BK, ionomycin, or PMA failed to increase these levels and failed to induce transphosphatidylation. From these results we conclude that PLD activation is entirely mediated by (downstream of) PKC. Unexpectedly, however, BK stimulation of these PKC-depleted cells caused a marked generation of DG from PC within 15 s, which was not seen in BK-stimulated control cells, suggesting PC breakdown by a phospholipase C (PLCc). We conclude that cells stimulated with BK generate DG via both the PLCc and the PLD/PA hydrolase pathway, whereas PMA stimulates mainly the latter pathway. BK stimulation of normal cells leads to activation of PKC and, by consequence, to attenuation of the level of PLCc-generated DG and to stimulation of the PLD pathway, whereas the reverse occurs in PKC-down-regulated cells."
https://openalex.org/W1581324493,"Activating the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of v-Src in murine fibroblasts leads to increased expression of Egr-1, a mitogen-responsive transcription factor. v-Src-induced expression of Egr-1 is independent of protein synthesis and is controlled at the level of transcription. Target sequences responsive to v-Src-induced signals were investigated using deletion mutant and analysis of the Egr-1 promoter. Upstream Egr-1 promoter sequences linked to a reporter gene were cotransfected with a v-Src expression vector into NIH 3T3 cells. v-Src-enhanced gene expression from the Egr-1 promoter was dependent upon the presence of CC(A/T)6GG elements. The CC(A/T)6GG motif forms the core element of serum response elements (SREs) and is the binding site for serum response factor. The Egr-1 promoter sequences responsive to v-Src contained four SREs. Sequential deletion of these SREs reduced v-Src responsiveness to basal transcription levels. A single SRE from this region was able to confer v-Src responsiveness to a heterologous promoter, and a mutation to the CC(A/T)6GG box of this SRE abolished v-Src-enhanced gene expression. Thus, an early response of v-Src-induced intracellular signaling is the transcriptional activation of a growth factor-responsive transcription factor via an SRE."
https://openalex.org/W1516696899,"Abstract To evaluate the hypothesis that phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) might modulate the expression of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene in epithelial cells, we examined the effect of PMA on mRNA levels and regulation of Cl- secretion. Strikingly, PMA down-regulated mRNA transcript numbers in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Importantly, in parallel with the reduction of mRNA levels, PMA-treated cells were unable to up-regulate Cl- secretion in a normal fashion in response to forskolin, an effect which was also dose- and time-dependent. Thus, PMA is capable of modulating expression of the gene and induces T84 cells to adopt the CF phenotype in regard to regulation of Cl- ion transport."
https://openalex.org/W1582598840,"Human relaxin, a two-chain protein hormone, was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis in combination with a novel thiol-protecting group strategy whereby the three disulfide bonds could be synthesized sequentially and without error. The final product was shown to be homogeneous by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography and electrophoresis and had the correct amino acid composition and sequence. Tryptic digestion and peptide mapping of the synthetic relaxin by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography resulted in a pattern identical with that produced by standard tryptic relaxin fragments synthetized by different methods. Three human relaxin derivatives containing oxidized methionine, formyltryptophan, and bis[B13,B17-citrulline]-relaxin, were produced and their biological activity and structural similarity to human relaxin was assessed. All derivatives, except those containing modified tryptophan residues, showed indistinguishable circular dichroic spectra, indicating that the modifications did not cause significant structural changes. However, only human relaxin and the tryptophan- and methionine-protected relaxin derivatives showed bioactivity. The derivative in which the two arginines in positions B13 and B17 had been replaced by the uncharged isosteric amino acid citrulline were biologically inactive. This observation confirms preliminary studies (Bullesbach, E. E. and Schwabe, C. (1988) Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 32, 361-367) that suggested that these two conserved arginines located in the midregion of the relaxin B chain are essential for the function of the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1524548385,"The structural basis of function of tissue factor (TF), the cell surface receptor and cofactor for the serine protease factor VIIa, cannot be inferred from the primary sequence. The functional significance of the two disulfide bonded loops in the surface domain of TF has been analyzed using site-directed mutagenesis to selectively preclude covalent stabilization of these loops by pairwise substitution of serine residues for cysteines. Mutant TF lacking either the amino (TFS49S57) or carboxyl (TFS186S209) disulfide bond were expressed on the surface of cells consistent with proper processing. Each reacted with a panel of monoclonal antibodies further suggesting proper global folding of the mutant proteins. TFS186S209 exhibited a selective decrease in reactivity with an antibody directed against one epitope locus in the carboxyl aspect of the surface domain of TF. Whereas TFS49S57 was functionally comparable to the wild type protein, TFS186S209 was functionally 30-40-fold less effective, and the affinity of factor VIIa binding to this mutant was indirectly estimated to be diminished 20-fold. These data suggest that the Cys186-Cys209 disulfide bond is required to maintain conformation and implicate the disulfide loop or adjacent structures in the carboxyl half of the surface domain of TF in receptor function."
https://openalex.org/W2103126456,"Cyclophilin is an abundant and ubiquitous cytosolic protein that is conserved throughout evolution from man to bacteria. It is the target of the immunosuppressive drug cyclosporin A. Cyclophilin has peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans-isomerase activity, and it accelerates protein folding in vitro, suggesting that it might be involved in the folding of cytosolic proteins. We describe a novel cyclophilin-like protein, S-cyclophilin, in the chick. Analysis of S-cyclophilin cDNA revealed the presence of a signal sequence followed by an open reading frame coding for a protein very similar to cytosolic cyclophilin, except for the presence of unique additional short amino acid segments at the N and C termini of the protein. S-Cyclophilin mRNA was abundant and present in all embryonic chick tissues tested. Cyclophilin and S-cyclophilin are coded by separate genes in the chick genome. Recombinant S-cyclophilin was expressed in insect cells by means of the baculovirus system. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that a significant fraction of newly synthesized recombinant S-cyclophilin was rapidly secreted into the culture medium. Our findings indicate that cyclophilins are associated with most if not all intra- and extracellular compartments and suggest that enzyme-assisted conformational conversions in proteins might also take place in post-endoplasmic reticulum compartments, possibly including the extracellular space."
https://openalex.org/W1532372627,"This study was designed to clone, sequence, and express the full-length cDNA for the human platelet p24/CD9 antigen. A 1.3-kilobase cDNA clone was identified that has an open reading frame encoding a mature protein of 228 amino acids (approximately 25,400 Da) containing 10 cysteine residues and four putative transmembrane domains. The identity of the clone was confirmed by: (i) its predicted size, (ii) identity to four peptide sequences from the isolated protein including the NH2 terminus, and (iii) expression of the isolated clone in Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells. p24/CD9 has sequence identity (24-34%) to four other cell-surface proteins: ME491, a melanoma antigen; CO-029, a carcinoma antigen; CD37, a leukocyte antigen; and SM23, an antigen of the parasitic helminth Schistosoma mansoni. The five proteins have a similar number of amino acids and are characterized by the presence of four putative transmembrane domains. These data indicate the presence of a new family of surface antigens that may function in cellular activation and differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1527037471,"Stimulation of human fibroblasts with bradykinin (BK) results in the generation of diacylglycerol (DG) and phosphatidic acid (PA). Prelabeling of the cells with [3H]arachidonic acid and [14C]palmitic acid allowed us to quantitate these lipid second messengers and to determine their origin, i.e. DGi and PAi from 3H-enriched inositol phospholipids, and DGc and PAc from 14C-enriched phosphatidylcholine, respectively. BK elicited a biphasic DG response: a first peak at 10-15 s, containing DGi, followed by a second peak at 10-30 min, which is mainly DGc. The latter did not result from de novo lipid biosynthesis. BK also generated free [3H]arachidonate and, to a lesser extent, mono[3H]arachidonoylglycerol. BK stimulation rapidly increased PAi, much more so than PAc, suggesting that DGi, rather than DGc, is the preferred substrate for the enzyme DG kinase. Short pretreatment of the cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) abolished the BK-induced breakdown of phosphoinositides, but did not affect the second-phase DGc level. PMA alone also elicited DGc formation, but more slowly, suggesting a different mechanism. Down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) by long term treatment with phorbol ester, prior to BK stimulation, resulted in (i) enhanced DGi and decreased PAi formation, suggesting that DG kinase activity is positively controlled by PKC; (ii) the unexpected manifestation of rapidly formed DGc; (iii) no change in the DGc levels obtained after 30-min BK stimulation, but complete suppression of PMA-induced DGc formation. In contrast, two inhibitors of PKC, staurosporin and 1-O-hexadecyl-2-O-methylglycerol, inhibited both BK- and PMA-induced DGc formation at 30 min, leaving the rapid response towards BK unaffected. The results suggest that the BK-induced rapid and later-phase DG formation and the PMA-induced DG formation are differentially controlled by PKC via mechanisms that differ in the susceptibility to down-regulation or inhibition of PKC."
https://openalex.org/W1501290049,"The amiloride-sensitive, growth factor-activatable Na/H exchanger (NHE-1) is a ubiquitous mammalian protein that is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH and cell volume. We have determined the intron/exon boundaries and the transcription initiation sites and have characterized a portion of the 5'-flanking regulatory region of the human NHE-1 gene. The Na/H exchanger gene spans approximately 70 kilobases. The coding region is divided into 12 exons and 11 introns, one of which is 41.5 kilobases in length. The first exon contains the entire 5'-noncoding region, which is 786 bases long, and 352 bases of the coding sequence. Primer extension identified two discrete start sites for RNA polymerase. 1377 bases of the 5'-regulatory region were sequenced. The promoter/enhancer region is characterized by a TATA box, four GC boxes, two CAAT boxes, five CACCC boxes, three Ap-1 sites, a cyclic AMP response element, and four partial glucocorticoid response elements. Promoter activities of a 313- and a 1441-base pair fragment containing the TATA box were demonstrated by their ability to direct chloramphenicol acetyltransferase expression when transiently expressed in fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1483888206,"The nahR gene from the NAH7 naphthalene degradation plasmid encodes a LysR-type transcriptional activator of the nah and sal promoters (Pnah and Psal, respectively) that responds to the inducer salicylate. In vivo methylation protection experiments with dimethyl sulfate showed that in the absence of inducer, NahR interacts in a similar manner with its target sites at Psal and Pnah. Both target sites also have very similar sequences comprised of a 4-base pair interrupted dyad containing two symmetrical guanines (-73 and -64 of Pnah; -71 and -62 of Psal), each located in adjacent major grooves on the same helical face, and both strongly protected by NahR. When inducer was present, several additional guanines of Pnah (-35, -45, and -58) and Psal (-42 and -40) became protected from methylation, while a guanine at -52 of Pnah became markedly enhanced for methylation, indicating that inducer and NahR-dependent interactions with these downstream sites of each promoter are quite different. Deletion of Psal sequences downstream of -30 did not affect its methylation patterns suggesting that NahR alone is responsible for the altered reactivities of these nucleotides. Similar in vivo methylation analyses with inducer-insensitive or inducer-independent NahR mutants also suggested that all alterations in methylation sensitivity are directly caused by NahR. It is more probable that the salicylate-induced reactivity changes result from direct NahR-guanine contacts which are required for, but not sufficient for transcription activation; however, they could also result from NahR-induced DNA contortions caused by upstream protein-DNA contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1554234248,"Although insulin is known to activate several protein serine/threonine protein kinases, its ability to activate protein kinase C remains controversial. We reinvestigated this question, taking advantage of several technical advances such as the development of fibroblast cell lines that overexpress normal human insulin receptors, and the development of antibodies to and expression vectors for the myristoylated, alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein, a major cellular substrate for protein kinase C. In HIR 3.5 cells, a mouse 3T3 cell derivative that expresses about 6 x 10(6) human insulin receptors/cell, insulin (70 nM for 10 min) stimulated phosphorylation of the MARCKS protein by approximately 2-fold (p less than 0.005). This phosphorylation was not further increased by different times of insulin exposure, different insulin concentrations, or longer periods of serum deprivation. The insulin stimulation represented about 14% of the response to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and about 17% of the response to 10% fetal calf serum. No significant stimulation of MARCKS protein phosphorylation was seen in four other insulin-sensitive cell lines, in which insulin is known to activate other protein serine/threonine kinases: HIRC-B, BC3H-1, 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and H35 rat hepatoma cells made to stably express the MARCKS protein. In these four cell lines, serum and/or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate exerted a large stimulatory effect on MARCKS protein phosphorylation. We conclude that insulin may activate protein kinase C to a minor extent in certain cell types that vastly overexpress insulin receptors; however, we believe that this effect of insulin is unlikely to be of physiological importance."
https://openalex.org/W1565322718,"Cofilin is an F-actin side-binding and -depolymerizing protein with an apparent molecular mass of 21 kDa. By means of the end label fingerprinting method, the amino acid residue on cofilin sequence cross-linked to actin by zero length cross-linker, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino propyl)carbodiimide, was identified as Lys112 and/or Lys114. A synthetic dodecapeptide patterned on the sequence around the actin-cross-linking site of cofilin (Trp104-Met115) inhibited the binding of cofilin to actin. Moreover, the dodecapeptide was found to be a potent inhibitor of actin polymerization. Thus, we conclude that the dodecapeptide sequence constitutes the region essential for the actin-binding and -depolymerizing activity of cofilin. A sequence similar to the dodecapeptide is found in other actin-depolymerizing proteins, destrin, actin-depolymerizing factor, and depactin. Therefore, the dodecapeptide sequence may be a consensus sequence essential for actin-binding and -depolymerizing activity in actin-depolymerizing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1593816301,"A previous study identified a Chinese hamster ovary cell mutant, pgsE-606, which is defective in the N-sulfotransferase that catalyzes one of the initial polymer-modification reactions in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (Bame, K. J., and Esko, J. D. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8059-8065). The structure of heparan sulfate generated by these cells reflects a 3-5-fold reduction in enzyme activity. The mutant produces heparan sulfate with half the content of N-sulfated glucosamine residues of that produced by wild-type cells and a more sparse distribution of N-sulfated residues. The present study demonstrates corresponding reductions in the proportion of 6-O-sulfated glucosamine residues (41% reduction) and the content of L-iduronic acid (51% reduction). The amount of 2-O-sulfated L-iduronic acid declines more dramatically (from 25% of total L-iduronic acid in the wild type to 8.4% in the mutant). Enzymatic assay of mixed O-sulfotransferases showed that the mutant has more activity than the wild type. Previous studies on the biosynthesis of heparin/heparan sulfate in cell-free systems point to a pivotal role of N-sulfation in determining the extent of the subsequent polymer-modification reactions. The present study shows that this concept also applies to heparan sulfate biosynthesis in the intact cell."

Bacterially expressed PKI has an inhibitory activity identical to that of the protein isolated from rabbit skeletal muscle and, by gel filtration and gel electrophoresis, has the same physicochemical characteristics as the native physiological form of PKI. Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy and CD establish that PKI has unusually large amounts of random coil and turn structures, with significantly smaller amounts of alpha-helix and beta structures."
https://openalex.org/W1557078740,"The transcriptional factors, OmpR and EnvZ, are crucially involved in the osmotic regulation of ompF and ompC expression in Escherichia coli. The DNA binding ability of the positive regulator, OmpR, is modulated through its phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mediated by EnvZ in response to the medium osmolarity. In this study, two examples of a novel type of mutant ompR allele, ompR96A and ompR115S, whose phenotype is OmpF- OmpC- irrespective of the medium osmolarity, were characterized. These mutations result in amino acid conversions, Glu96 to Ala and Arg115 to Ser, respectively, within the phosphorylation domain of OmpR. Nevertheless, these mutant proteins were capable of undergoing phosphorylation and dephosphorylation normally, just like wild-type OmpR. However, the phosphorylation-dependent enhancement of their in vitro DNA binding ability was found to be severely affected. It was thus revealed that these mutant OmpR represent a novel type in terms of the mechanism of phosphorylation-dependent activation of the function of OmpR, i.e. those are normally phosphorylated but not activated to bind to the cognate promoter DNAs. In this respect, it was further suggested that OmpR oligomerization may be involved in the mechanism underlying the phosphorylation-dependent enhancement of the DNA binding ability of OmpR. The mutant proteins characterized in this study seem to be defective in this particular oligomerization process observed in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1518225701,"Calcifiable proteolipids present in mineralizing tissues have been postulated to enhance apatite deposition by structuring membrane phosphatidylserine molecules into a conformation conducive to mineral formation. To examine whether proteolipid-like molecules are present in mineralizable matrix vesicles (MV), the vesicles were first extracted with chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v), and then with chloroform/methanol/HCl (200:100:1, v/v) and the organic-soluble proteins subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. Protein fractions were analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining and by immunoblot analysis of electrophoretically transferred MV protein with antisera to the 33- and 36-kDa annexins. We found that several MV proteins selectively partitioned into the lipophilic milieu under acidic conditions; however, very little protein did so at neutral pH. The principal organic-soluble MV proteins had molecular masses of 14, 33, and 36 kDa, with lesser bands at 28, 30, and 68 kDa. Immunological analyses revealed that the 33- and 36-kDa proteins were the MV annexins; the 14-kDa protein appeared to be hemoglobin, based on NH2-terminal sequencing. Our findings indicate that under acidic conditions the 33- and 36-kDa MV annexins undergo a conformational change which imparts a marked increase in the hydrophobicity of the proteins. While these observations reveal that the annexins possess proteolipid-like properties, radiolabeling and immunoprecipitation studies using [3H]myristic acid in chondrocyte cultures indicate that the MV annexins are not myristylated. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the peptides generated by site-specific cleavage of the 33- and the 36-kDa MV annexins at tryptophan residues indicate that the 33 kDa is highly homologous to anchorin CII, a protein known to bind type II collagen, while the 36-kDa protein shares close homology with endonexin II, a tyrosine kinase substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1945671652,"Abstract Diethylpyrocarbonate modification of endoglucanase D from Clostridium thermocellum, cloned in Escherichia coli, resulted in a rapid but partial (maximally 70-80%) loss of activity. The second-order rate constant of inactivation proved to be exceptionally high (3210 M-1.min-1). A 3-fold reduction of the kcat and a 2-fold increase of the Km for 2'-chloro-4'-nitrophenyl beta-cellobioside were observed. Spectrophotometric analysis indicate the presence of one rapidly (k = 0.45 min-1) and two slower (k = 0.23 min-1) reacting histidyl residues. In the presence of 50 mM methyl beta-cellotrioside, the rate of inactivation was reduced 16-fold, and the kinetics of modification were compatible with the protection of 1 histidyl residue. Since peptide analysis was inconclusive, identification of the critical residue was attempted by site-directed mutagenesis. Each of the 12 histidyl residues present in the endoglucanase D sequence was mutated into either Ala or Ser. Seven of the mutant enzymes had specific activities lower than 50% of the wild-type. Only in the case of the Ser-516 mutant, however, was the residual activity not affected by diethyl pyrocarbonate. These findings suggest an important functional or structural role for His-516 in the wild-type enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1506479591,"We have examined three strains of Azotobacter vinelandii, which contain defined deletions within the nifH, nifB, or nifE genes. All three strains accumulate inactive FeMo cofactor-deficient forms of the MoFe protein of nitrogenase. These forms can be activated in vitro by addition of isolated FeMo cofactor in N-methylformamide. Although the phenotypes of these strains are superficially the same, our characterizations demonstrate that the FeMo cofactor-deficient MoFe protein synthesized by the delta nifH strain is quite different from that synthesized by either the delta nifB or delta nifE strains. These differences include the following: 1) the activation of the delta nifH protein requires MgATP, whereas the activation of the delta nifB and delta nifE proteins does not; 2) the delta nifH extracts can be activated with FeMo cofactor to wild-type levels of activity, whereas delta nifB and delta nifE extracts cannot; 3) the delta nifH protein is markedly less heat stable than the delta nifB and delta nifE proteins; and 4) the migration of the delta nifH protein on native gels is very different when compared with delta nifB and delta nifE, which look like each other. These data can be explained if the nifB and nifE gene products are only involved in FeMo cofactor biosynthesis, whereas the nifH gene product is involved in both the initial synthesis of FeMo cofactor and in the insertion of preformed FeMo cofactor into the MoFe protein. A model is presented that suggests that the FeMo cofactor-deficient MoFe protein synthesized by the delta nifH strain is the one that normally participates in MoFe protein assembly in wild-type cells."

The cap structure facilitates the melting of mRNA 5' secondary structure through the action of initiation factor-4F (eIF-4F) in conjunction with eIF-4B. eIF-4F consists of three subunits of which one, eIF-4E (eIF-4E has recently been designated eIF-4 alpha according to the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (NC-IUB) (Safer, B.

Consequently, changes in cellular eIF-4E levels could control growth and differentiation. To investigate the possibility that eIF-4E expression is regulated, we studied the pattern of eIF-4E expression in several cell lines. Here, we show the existence of multiple mRNAs for eIF-4E that are generated by differential polyadenylation. In addition, we show tissue-specific differences in eIF-4E mRNA expression and utilization of polyadenylation sites."
https://openalex.org/W1494169404,"The ileS gene encoding the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase of the thermophilic archaebacterium Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum Marburg was isolated and sequenced. ileS was closely flanked by an unknown open reading frame and by purL and thus is arranged differently from the organizations observed in several eubacteria or in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The deduced amino acid sequence of isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase was compared with primary sequences of isoleucyl-, valyl-, leucyl-, and methionyl-tRNA synthetases from eubacteria and yeast. The archaebacterial enzyme fitted well into this group of enzymes. It contained the two short consensus sequences observed in class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as well as regions of homology with enzymes of the isoleucine family. Comparison between the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetases of M. thermoautotrophicum yielded 36% amino acid identity with the yeast enzyme and 32% identity with the corresponding enzyme from Escherichia coli. The ileS gene of the pseudomonic acid-resistant M. thermoautotrophicum mutant MBT10 was also sequenced. The mutant enzyme had undergone a glycine to aspartic acid transition at position 590, in a conserved region comprising the KMSKS consensus sequence. The inhibition constants of pseudomonic acid, KiIle and KiATP, for the mutant enzyme were 10-fold higher than those determined for the wild-type enzyme. Both the mutant and the wild-type ileS gene were expressed in E. coli, and their products displayed the expected difference in sensitivity toward pseudomonic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1527241933,"The Mr = 38,300 polypeptide of the purified recombinant rat DNA polymerase beta served as an excellent substrate for protein kinase C (PKC) in vitro but not for the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase. The phosphorylation by PKC resulted in inactivation of DNA polymerase beta activity, and recovery was achieved by dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase. Since the phosphorylated DNA polymerase beta was retained with use of a single-stranded DNA-cellulose column, inactivation might occur at a site different from that for the DNA binding. Amino acid sequence analysis of the phosphopeptides revealed that the phosphorylated sites were 2 serine residues at positions 44 and 55 from the NH2 terminus, either or both of which might be involved in the catalytic activity of DNA polymerase beta. Thus, the inactivation of the DNA repair enzyme, DNA polymerase beta, by PKC may be an important process in the modification of DNA metabolism in the nucleus through signal transduction processes."
https://openalex.org/W1493792408,"Hirudin is a 65-amino acid polypeptide with three disulfide linkages. It is stable under extreme pH (1.47-12.9), high temperature (95 degrees C), and in the presence of denaturants (6 M guanidinium chloride or 8 M urea). The thrombin inhibitory activity of hirudin remains unaffected even after cleavage of an internal peptide bond (Lys36-Asn37). One condition which effectively and irreversibly inactivates hirudin is the combination of elevated temperature and alkaline pH. Structural analysis reveals that inactivation is a consequence of base-catalyzed beta-elimination of the disulfide bonds. The reaction leads to the conversion of hirudin to a mixture of highly heterogeneous polymers (from monomer to heptamer) which are intra- and intermolecularly cross-linked by cystine (20%), lanthionine (50%), and lysinoalanine (30%)."
https://openalex.org/W1533931894,"Ceramide glycanase (CGase) isolated from the leech Macrobdella decora was found to transfer the oligosaccharide en bloc from various glycosphingolipids to suitable acceptors. For example, CGase transferred the intact II3NeuAcGgOse4 from GM1 to 4-phenyl-1-butanol, 1,8-octanediol and various 1-alkanols having a chain length of six or more carbons. Among various 1-alkanols, 1-octanol was found to be the best acceptor. In an incubation mixture of 50 microliters containing 30 nmol of GM1, 50 micrograms of sodium cholate, 20 microliters of 1-octanol, and 0.1 unit of CGase, the ratio between hydrolysis and transglycosylation was approximately 3:1. Negative fast atom bombardment-mass spectral analysis of the enzymatically synthesized octyl-II3NeuAcGgOse4 showed a mass ion at m/z 1109.7 for the parent ion, consistent with its expected mass. NMR analysis of the enzymatically synthesized octyl-II3NeuAcGgOse4 showed that the Glc residue is linked to the octanol through a beta-linkage. Vicinal coupling constants of the ring protons of the sugar residues indicate that their pyranose ring geometries are not affected by the transferase activity. CGase also transferred the oligosaccharide from GM1 to CF3CO-NH(CH2)5CH2OH, (CH3)3CO-CO-NH(CH2)5CH2OH, (HOCH2)3C-NHCO-(CH2)4-COOMe, CH2 = CH-(CH2)7CH2OH and 1,2:3,4-di-O-isopropylidene-D-galactopyranose. The oligosaccharide transferring reaction carried out by CGase should become useful for the synthesis of neoglycoconjugates to study the biological functions expressed by glycan chains in glycosphingolipids."
https://openalex.org/W1521082687,"Reversible binding of a ligand to an enzyme active site can elicit a variety of changes in the protein, such as conformational changes (close to the site of binding or communicated over long distances), changes in the ionization state of surrounding amino acid side chains, changes in the interaction of the target protein with other subunits (or other proteins), or even changes in the thermodynamic stability of the protein. Relatively little attention has been given to studying these effects in proteins to which the ligand has been irreversibly bound, yet this can be a convenient way of studying the effects of ligand binding in the absence of association/dissociation equilibria. We report the dramatic changes which occur to the shikimate pathway enzyme dehydroquinase when ligand is attached to its active site after borohydride reduction of the mechanistically important Schiff's base intermediates. The effects of this modification have been characterized by limited proteolysis, circular dichroism, guanidine hydrochloride denaturation, and differential scanning calorimetry. The conclusions from these studies are that although anchoring the ligand at the active site does not cause a gross change in conformation, it does increase markedly the conformational stability of the protein. This is conclusively established by three separate experiments: 1) the modified protein is completely resistant to proteases, whereas the unmodified protein is very susceptible to proteolysis; 2) the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride required to unfold the ligand-linked dehydroquinase is 3-4-fold greater than that of the unmodified protein; 3) the melting temperature (Tm) of the modified protein is 40 degrees C higher than that of the unmodified protein. These results are a very clear example of the thermodynamic link between ligand binding, conformational stability, and proteolytic susceptibility in vitro and will be a useful system for dissecting the contributions of individual protein-ligand interactions to these parameters."
https://openalex.org/W58875170,"Porphobilinogen deaminase, the third enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway, is encoded by a gene having two different promoters. Differential splicing of transcripts from the promoters yields two distinct mRNA species that are translated to give two isoforms of the protein. One isoform is ubiquitous, whereas the other is erythroid-specific. In this study, we have analyzed the gene regulatory elements that contribute to the tissue-specific promoter utilization of the mouse porphobilinogen deaminase gene. Six nuclear DNase I-hypersensitive sites were mapped in erythroid and nonerythroid cells, and four of these regions were further analyzed for in vitro nuclear protein-binding sites. The erythroid-specific promoter contains three erythroid nuclear factor GF-1-binding sites. The proximal GF-1-binding site, together with an adjacent duplicated CACCC motif, was sufficient to confer erythroid-specific expression in functional studies. Furthermore, as upstream gene sequences were shown to greatly increase promoter activity in erythroid cells, it suggests an upstream erythroid-specific enhancer may also be required for the up-regulation of the erythroid-specific promoter during erythropoiesis."

The primary function of the 42 S particle is the long-term storage of 5 S RNA and aminoacyl-tRNA. Thesaurin a is homologous to eukaryotic elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) and to prokaryotic elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu). Sequence comparison with EF-1 alpha and EF-Tu of different species indicates that thesaurin a is rather distantly related to all eukaryotic elongation factors. In spite of this, the secondary structure of thesaurin a, deduced from hydrophobic cluster analysis, is remarkably similar to that of EF-1 alpha and EF-Tu. The binding and catalytic properties of thesaurin a are also similar but not identical to those of EF-1 alpha. Like EF-1 alpha, purified thesaurin a binds tRNA, GDP, and GTP. Unlike EF-1 alpha, thesaurin a binds discharged tRNA more tightly than charged tRNA, and GTP more tightly than GDP. Thesaurin a also hydrolyzes GTP and catalyzes the mRNA-dependent binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to 80 S ribosomes. The functional properties of the 42 S particle are in general agreement with those of purified thesaurin a. In particular, the 42 S particle contains GTP and efficiently transfers aminoacyl-tRNA to 80 S ribosomes without addition of exogenous elongation factor."
https://openalex.org/W1578564782,"First incubating dispersed acini from rat pancreas with monensin, a cation ionophore that can inhibit recycling of receptors, inhibited binding of 125I-cholecystokinin 8 (125I-CCK-8) measured during a second incubation by as much as 50%. A maximal effect of monensin required 90 min of first incubation. Detectable inhibition of binding of 125I-CCK-8 occurred with 300 nM monensin, and inhibition increased progressively with concentrations of monensin up to 25 microM. Pancreatic acini possess two classes of receptors that bind 125I-CCK-8. One class has a high affinity (Kd = 461 pM) and a low capacity for CCK (512 fmol/mg DNA); the other class has a low affinity (Kd = 47 nM) and a high capacity for CCK (18 pmol/mg DNA). First incubating acini with monensin caused an 84% decrease in the number of high affinity CCK receptors with no change in the number of low affinity CCK receptors or the values of Kd for either class of receptors indicating that there is recycling of high affinity CCK receptors but not low affinity CCK receptors. First incubating acini with monensin did not alter CCK-stimulated amylase secretion indicating that in contrast to previous conclusions, occupation of low affinity CCK receptors mediates CCK-stimulated enzyme secretion. Moreover, the biphasic dose-response curve for CCK-stimulated enzyme secretion from monensin-treated acini suggests that pancreatic acini also possess a third, previously unrecognized class of very low affinity CCK receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1505851435,"The LpS1 genes of the sea urchin Lytechinus pictus are activated early in development in aboral ectoderm cells. They therefore have ontogenic properties similar to their counterparts in Stronglyocentrotus purpuratus, the Spec genes. Both gene families encode proteins belonging to the calmodulin superfamily as evidenced by the presence of distinct EF-hand (helix-loop-helix) domains. The presence of eight EF-hand domains in LpS1 proteins suggests that the LpS1 genes arose from a duplication of an ancestral Spec-like gene. The LpS1 genes were further analyzed to increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying their evolution and activation in aboral ectoderm cells. Genomic DNA blot analysis showed two LpS1 genes, LpS1 alpha and LpS1 beta, which did not appear to be closely linked. LpS1 genomic clones were isolated by screening an L. pictus genomic library with an LpS1 cDNA clone, and partial gene structures for both LpS1 alpha and LpS1 beta were constructed. These revealed internal duplication of the LpS1 genes that accounted for the eight EF-hand domains in the LpS1 proteins. Duplication of exon 1 in both genes suggested four different LpS1 proteins could be derived from the LpS1 genes. Primer extension to map the transcriptional initiation sites of the LpS1 genes and sequencing analysis showed there was little in common among the 5'-flanking regions of the LpS1 and Spec genes except for the presence of a binding site for the transcription factor USF. A sea urchin gene-transfer expression system showed that 762 base pairs (bp) of 5'-flanking DNA and 17 bp of 5'-untranslated leader sequence of the LpS1 beta gene were sufficient for correct temporal and spatial expression of reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and lacZ genes in sea urchin embryos. Deletions at the 5' end to either 511 or 368 bp resulted in a 3-4 fold decrease in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity and disrupted the exclusive activation of the lacZ gene in aboral ectodermal cells. Based on a lineage analysis among the LpS1 and Spec gene families and other related genes, we propose a model in which LpS1 genes evolved from a series of duplications of an ancestral Spec-like gene."
https://openalex.org/W1565022755,"T4 endonuclease V is a pyrimidine dimer-specific DNA repair enzyme which has been previously shown not to require metal ions for either of its two catalytic activities or its DNA binding function by virtue of its ability to function in the presence of metal-chelating agents. However, we have investigated whether the single cysteine within the enzyme was able to bind metal salts and influence the various activities of this repair enzyme. A series of metals (Hg2+, Ag+, Cu+) were shown to inactivate both endonuclease Vs pyrimidine dimer-specific DNA glycosylase activity and the subsequent apurinic nicking activity. The binding of metal to endonuclease V did not interfere with nontarget DNA scanning or pyrimidine dimer-specific binding. The Cys-78 codon within the endonuclease V gene was changed by oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis to Thr-78 and Ser-78 in order to determine whether the native cysteine was directly involved in the enzyme's DNA catalytic activities and whether the cysteine was primarily responsible for the metal binding. The mutant enzymes were able to confer enhanced ultraviolet light (UV) resistance to DNA repair-deficient Escherichia coli at levels equal to that conferred by the wild type enzyme. The C78T mutant enzyme was purified to homogeneity and shown to be catalytically active on pyrimidine dimer-containing DNA. The catalytic activities of the C78T mutant enzyme were demonstrated to be unaffected by the addition of Hg2+ or Ag+ at concentrations 1000-fold greater than that required to inhibit the wild type enzyme. These data suggest that the cysteine is not required for enzyme activity but that the binding of certain metals to that amino acid block DNA incision by either preventing a conformational change in the enzyme after it has bound to a pyrimidine dimer or sterically interfering with the active site residue's accessibility to the pyrimidine dimer."
https://openalex.org/W1497376115,"Recombinant human interleukin-3 (rhuIL-3) variants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and expression in Escherichia coli. Amino acid deletions and substitutions were made in the previously identified epitopes of two huIL-3-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). The rhuIL-3 variants were analyzed for their ability to bind to the IL-3 receptor and to induce the proliferation of the human IL-3-dependent cell line M-O7. Several deletion mutants spanning the epitopes of these neutralizing mAbs indicated the importance of residues Pro33 and Leu34 for biological activity. Further, substitution of Pro33 with Asn (Asn33) showed an enhanced proliferative activity (4-fold) and a moderate increase in receptor binding (2-fold) compared to wild-type (wt) rhuIL-3. The most remarkable change, however, was seen with variant Gly33, which showed a 14-fold increase in promoting the growth of M-O7 cells without a significant modification in its receptor binding capacity. In contrast, substitution of Leu34 with Gly (Gly34) yielded an IL-3 variant that had a 25-fold decreased receptor binding capacity and proliferative activity, while Glu34 had properties similar to wild-type rhuIL-3. Analysis of the binding of these variants to different rhuIL-3-specific monoclonal antibodies suggested that no major modification had occurred in their conformations. These results indicate that both residues, Pro33 and Leu34, play a critical role in modulating the activity of rhuIL-3."

In three different insulin-sensitive cell types, insulin activated Raf-1 kinase kinase activity in crude cytosolic cellular fractions. The insulin stimulation of this activity was evident as early as 2 min after exposure to insulin, maximal at 5-8 min, and inapparent at 15 min. Phosphoamino acid analysis of phosphorylated Raf-1 revealed that serine was the primary phosphate acceptor for the insulin-activated kinase or kinases; small amounts of phosphothreonine were also detected. The insulin effect occurred in cells depleted of protein kinase C, and in extracts depleted of endogenous Raf-1 kinase by immunodepletion; these data argue against protein kinase C or Raf-1 kinase itself being the insulin-stimulated activity. The insulin-activated kinase or kinases phosphorylated the Raf-1 protein on multiple sites in vitro, as evidenced by tryptic mapping; at least some of these appeared to overlap with sites phosphorylated in response to serum in intact cells. Several other mitogens and growth factors stimulated Raf-1 kinase kinase activity, including epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, serum, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This insulin- and mitogen-stimulated Raf-1 kinase kinase activity may play a role in mediating the phosphorylation and possibly the activation of the Raf-1 kinase by insulin and other growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W1561282829,"Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells accumulate glycinebetaine via Na(+)-dependent transport in response to hypertonic stress. When extracellular tonicity is increased by the addition of NaCl, Vmax for glycinebetaine transport increases without an associated change in Km, consistent with an increase in the number of functioning transporters. To test whether increased transport activity results from increased gene expression, we injected poly(A)+ RNA (mRNA) from MDCK cells into Xenopus oocytes and assayed for glycinebetaine uptake in ovo. RNA-induced Na(+)-dependent uptake is observed in oocytes injected with mRNA from cells exposed to high extracellular NaCl, but not in oocytes injected with either water or mRNA from cells maintained in isotonic medium. Unfractionated mRNA induces glycinebetaine uptake in ovo at a rate which is approximately 3-fold higher than in water-injected controls. Size-fractionated mRNA (median size 2.8 kilobases) induces uptake at a rate which is approximately 7-fold higher than controls. Such RNA-induced transport activity in ovo is consistent with heterologous expression of Na(+)/glucinebetaine cotransporters encoded by renal mRNA. Increased transporter mRNA in cells exposed to hypertonicity probably underlies the pattern of expression observed in ovo. This can account for the observed rise in MDCK cell glycinebetaine transport during hypertonic stress."

The extra sequence, highly homologous in size variants, is situated between residues 133 and 157 in AKe. Removal of 25 codons in the corresponding adk gene resulted in expression of a modified form of adenylate kinase (delta 133-157 AKe) which still conserved 7% of the maximal activity of the wild-type protein. The apparent Km for nucleotide substrates was increased by a factor of 4.6 (ADP), 23 (ATP) or 43 (AMP) in delta 133-157 AKe when compared with the wild-type enzyme. The secondary structure of delta 133-157 AKe, as well as its thermal stability were very similar to the parent protein. However, the deleted protein was much more sensitive than the wild-type enzyme to inactivation by trypsin. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of trypsin digested delta 133-157 AKe revealed accumulation of several well defined fragments which were not observed in the case of wild-type enzyme. We conclude that the additional sequence, although necessary for expression of full activity in AKe, is not critical for catalysis. It is perhaps responsible for interaction of enzyme with other cellular components although a different mechanism of water shielding for large and small size variants of AK can be also envisaged."
https://openalex.org/W1540989282,"The chicken ovalbumin gene is regulated at the level of transcription by four classes of steroid hormones. A steroid-dependent regulatory element (SDRE) found from -900 to -732 is required for this steroid-mediated induction. To define more precisely sequences of the SDRE required for steroidal induction, a series of exonuclease III deletions were made in the 3‘ end of the SDRE. Fusion genes containing the mutant ovalbumin 5‘-flanking sequences linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase structural gene (CAT) were transfected into steroid-responsive primary oviduct cells. These functional studies defined a region of the SDRE from -793 to -759 that is essential for induction by steroids. Analysis of protein interactions in this 34-base pair region by copper-phenanthroline footprinting and methylation interference assays defined nucleotides required for protein binding. Footprinting showed protection of residues extending from -784 to -765, an area that included nucleotides that, when methylated, interfered with protein binding. In addition, this footprinted region contained 10 nucleotides that were identical to sequences contained in the beta-interferon gene regulatory element. An oligomer synthesized to this region of homology produced two DNA-protein complexes with oviduct nuclear proteins. Although this region of the interferon gene regulatory element binds the transcription factor NF-kappa B, an oligomer from the immunoglobulin kappa light chain gene known to bind NF-kappa B did not compete with the SDRE oligomer for binding to oviduct nuclear proteins. Surprisingly, this same NF-kappa B oligomer was able to restore steroid responsiveness to an SDRE mutant, while an oligomer from the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene inserted in the same position did not affect induction by steroids. These data suggest that a protein binding to sequences in the SDRE that are similar to an NF-kappa B-binding site participates in the steroid-mediated increase in transcription of the chicken ovalbumin gene."
https://openalex.org/W1557355508,"We have used variations in the trypsin sensitivity of eukaryotic protein synthesis elongation factor 2 (eEF-2) to probe for structural alterations induced by phosphorylation, ribosomal binding, or guanosine nucleotides. We could not detect any nucleotide-related effect on the tryptic cleavage rate of Arg66. However, eEF-2 was protected from trypsin after ribosomal binding. Also, phosphorylation of eEF-2 led to a protection of Arg66. This indicates that phosphorylation leads to a structural rearrangement that could explain the reduced affinity of the phosphorylated factor for ribosomes (Carlberg, U., Nilsson, A., and Nygard, O. (1990) Eur. J. Biochem. 191, 639-645). Cleavage of Arg66 led to a complete loss of the ability of the factor to be phosphorylated. Furthermore, ribosome-bound eEF-2 was found to be inaccessible for phosphorylation. Based on these findings and previously published data, we suggest that the region around the sites of phosphorylation and trypsin cleavage is vitally important for the factor function and ribosomal binding."
