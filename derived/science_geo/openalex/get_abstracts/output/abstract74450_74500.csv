https://openalex.org/W2011309288,"THE rat posterior pituitary in vitro secretes vasopressin in response to a rise in extracellular potassium concentration. This effect of excess potassium is inhibited by magnesium and sodium ions and is strongly dependent on calcium. Secretion is abolished by omitting calcium from the incubation medium; it increases with increasing calcium concentration over a wide range, and is accompanied by uptake of calcium-45. From such evidence it has been concluded that calcium entry into the neurosecretory terminals on their depolarization by action potentials is the normal physiological event initiating secretion1–3. This concept is supported by the demonstration of vasopressin release from rat3,4 and guinea-pig5 neurohypophyses in vitro in response to electrical stimuli and of action potentials recorded from the supra-opticohypophyseal tract6. It would clearly strengthen the hypothesis if it were shown that the effects of calcium and other ions on vasopressin release, elicited by electrical stimulation, were similar to their effects on secretion elicited by excess potassium. This communication presents evidence that this is so."

https://openalex.org/W2078483995,"PRESENT-DAY histochemical methods for demonstrating cholinesterases require the use of inhibitors in order to distinguish between acetyl- (that is, true, or specific) cholinesterase (AChE) and butyryl- (non-specific) cholinesterase (ChE). The histochemical technique determines AChE and ChE together, so that if either enzyme is inhibited without the other being affected, only the latter can be determined; thus an inhibitor of ChE makes it possible to determine AChE and vice versa."

https://openalex.org/W1987298333,"A NEW test of immediate memory was recently suggested by Buschke1. N — I items drawn from an ensemble of N are presented, and the task is to name the missing item. An experiment is described in which this technique, the ‘missing scan method’, was used to evaluate the effects of sub-anaesthetic doses of nitrous oxide on immediate memory. The results seem to cast light on underlying processes. It is suggested that two forms of storage may be distinguished—that used depending on the presentation-rate of items—and that one form is especially susceptible to drug effects."

https://openalex.org/W1964285248,"THE major pathway of androgen biosynthesis in the human adult adrenal gland is well established: pregnenolone→17α-hydroxypregnenolone→dehydroepiandrosterone→androstenedione1. Previous results indicate that the adult adrenal gland converts a higher percentage of 17α-hydroxypregnenolone than of progesterone to the product, androstenedione1. The data suggest that a pathway is possible which by-passes progesterone to form androgens: pregnenolone→17α-hydroxypregnenolone → 17 α-hydroxyprogesterone→androstenedione. This report describes the results of an incubation to determine the significance of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in the biosynthesis of androstenedione. Cortisol synthesis was determined also, for comparison. An adenoma removed at operation from a 35-year-old female with Cushing's syndrome was used for these studies."

https://openalex.org/W2008364832,"TRANSPLANTS from inbred strains to F1 hybrids derived from one isologous and one foreign parent are generally regarded as compatible. Skin grafts are accepted under these conditions, and most tumours give 100 per cent takes when transplanted by fragments or by inoculation of a heavy suspension. However, Snell1 reported decreased incidence of takes in F1 hybrids when small inocula were used, and recently Hellström2 has described similar findings using induced fibrosarcomas and a spontaneous mammary carcinoma. These reports raise the question whether all tumours exhibit this effect when transplanted in low dosage from their strain of origin to F1 hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2010335305,"IT is well recognized that the thyroid gland contains the L-amino acids, triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), monoiodotyrosine (MIT), diiodotyrosine (DIT) and iodinated thyronines which are free (unconjugated) but are bound to thyroglobulin. The release of these iodinated amino-acids occurs after digestion by protein-hydrolysing enzymes or chemicals, but the possibility of observing any T3 and/or T4 sulphate conjugates per se in thyroid tissues seems unlikely since hydrolytic procedures would have precluded their isolation."

https://openalex.org/W2084649852,"WE have recently shown1 that patients with folic acid and/or vitamin B12 (FA–B12) deficiency have an increased excretion of 4-aminoimidazole-5-carboxamide (AIC) compared with anaemic patients who are not so deficient, or with non-anaemic hospital patients. A FIGLU test, using an oral load of 15 g L-histidine hydrochloride, was performed on many of these patients as a diagnostic procedure; since a haematological response has been observed in such patients following histidine dosage2,3, which would imply a partial correction at least of the disordered nucleoprotein metabolism present in these deficiencies, we have taken the opportunity to investigate its effect on the urinary excretion of AIC, itself an intermediary in purine synthesis. For this purpose urine passed between 4 and 8 h after histidine dosage was examined (Period 3); urines collected during one hour in the morning immediately before the test (Period 2) and in some cases for a similar 5-h period the previous afternoon (Period 1) served as controls. For comparison, similar collections were made from 8 normal adult volunteers and 3 patients who had anaemia not associated with FA–B12 deficiency. No dietary restrictions were imposed during the test. Urines were preserved with 1 ml. 6 N HCl per h of the save and stored at 4° C. AIC was determined by an ion-exchange chromatographic technique4. In order to minimize any errors in the timing of the urine collections all results were expressed as AIC µg/mg creatinine."

Since we are interested in sperm nuclear areas in connexion with estimates of DNA in individual sperm nuclei, it was of interest to measure the projected areas of the chromosome images. The comments that follow all derive from the planimetric measurements (three times as complete sets by one observer, without reference to previously recorded measurements) from one karyogram."

https://openalex.org/W2031387416,"IN a recent paper Cleaver3 has investigated the uptake of nucleosides by tissue culture cells in physiological saline. From the results he states: “This suggests that the metabolism of these cells is markedly disturbed by brief exposures to a physiological saline and in particular the biosynthesis of the acid-insoluble fractions (for example, DNA and RNA) comes to a standstill. It has been assumed that under these conditions tritiated thymidine is incorporated into DNA and tritiated cytidine is incorporated into both DNA and RNA1,2”."
