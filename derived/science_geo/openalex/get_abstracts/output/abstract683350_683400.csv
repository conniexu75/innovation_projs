https://openalex.org/W3210921815,"With the global expansion of the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2) variant, we conducted a matched test-negative case-control study to assess the real-world effectiveness of COVID-19 messenger RNA vaccines against infection with Delta in Qatar's population. BNT162b2 effectiveness against any, symptomatic or asymptomatic, Delta infection was 45.3% (95% CI, 22.0-61.6%) ≥14 d after the first vaccine dose, but only 51.9% (95% CI, 47.0-56.4%) ≥14 d after the second dose, with 50% of fully vaccinated individuals receiving their second dose before 11 May 2021. Corresponding mRNA-1273 effectiveness ≥14 d after the first or second dose was 73.7% (95% CI, 58.1-83.5%) and 73.1% (95% CI, 67.5-77.8%), respectively. Notably, effectiveness against Delta-induced severe, critical or fatal disease was 93.4% (95% CI, 85.4-97.0%) for BNT162b2 and 96.1% (95% CI, 71.6-99.5%) for mRNA-1273 ≥ 14 d after the second dose. Our findings show robust effectiveness for both BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 in preventing Delta hospitalization and death in Qatar's population, despite lower effectiveness in preventing infection, particularly for the BNT162b2 vaccine."
https://openalex.org/W3209028723,"The effectiveness of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) BNT162b2 vaccine in preventing disease and reducing viral loads of breakthrough infections (BTIs) has been decreasing, concomitantly with the rise of the Delta variant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, it is unclear whether the observed decreased effectiveness of the vaccine in reducing viral loads is inherent to the Delta variant or is dependent on time from immunization. By analyzing viral loads of over 16,000 infections during the current, Delta-variant-dominated pandemic wave in Israel, we found that BTIs in recently fully vaccinated individuals have lower viral loads than infections in unvaccinated individuals. However, this effect starts to decline 2 months after vaccination and ultimately vanishes 6 months or longer after vaccination. Notably, we found that the effect of BNT162b2 on reducing BTI viral loads is restored after a booster dose. These results suggest that BNT162b2 might decrease the infectiousness of BTIs even with the Delta variant, and that, although this protective effect declines with time, it can be restored, at least temporarily, with a third, booster, vaccine dose."
https://openalex.org/W3208801862,"The high turnover and regenerative capacity of the adult intestine relies on resident stem cells located at the bottom of the crypt. The enteric nervous system consists of an abundant network of enteric glial cells (EGCs) and neurons. Despite the close proximity of EGCs to stem cells, their in vivo role as a stem cell niche is still unclear. By analyzing the mouse and human intestinal mucosa transcriptomes at the single-cell level, we defined the regulation of EGC heterogeneity in homeostasis and chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Ablation of EGC subpopulations revealed that the repair potential of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) is regulated by a specific subset of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ EGCs. Mechanistically, injury induces expansion of GFAP+ EGCs, which express several WNT ligands to promote LGR5+ ISC self-renewal. Our work reveals the dynamically regulated heterogeneity of EGCs as a key part of the intestinal stem cell niche in regeneration and disease."
https://openalex.org/W3209230329,"p53 is a well-established critical cell cycle regulator. By inducing transcription of the gene encoding p21, p53 inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)-mediated phosphorylation of cell cycle inhibitor retinoblastoma (RB) proteins. Phosphorylation of RB releases E2F transcription factor proteins that transactivate cell cycle-promoting genes. Here, we sought to uncover the contribution of p53, p21, CDK, RB, and E2F to the regulation of ferroptosis, an oxidative form of cell death. Our studies have uncovered unexpected complexity in this regulation. First, we showed that elevated levels of p53 enhance ferroptosis in multiple inducible and isogenic systems. On the other hand, we found that p21 suppresses ferroptosis. Elevation of CDK activity also suppressed ferroptosis under conditions where p21 suppressed ferroptosis, suggesting that the impact of p21 must extend beyond CDK inhibition. Furthermore, we showed that overexpression of E2F suppresses ferroptosis in part via a p21-dependent mechanism, consistent with reports that this transcription factor can induce transcription of p21. Finally, deletion of RB genes enhanced ferroptosis. Taken together, these results show that signals affecting ferroptotic sensitivity emanate from multiple points within the p53 tumor suppressor pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3208002485,"Proper assembly and function of the nervous system requires the generation of a uniquely diverse population of neurons expressing a cell-type-specific combination of effector genes that collectively define neuronal morphology, connectivity, and function. How countless partially overlapping but cell-type-specific patterns of gene expression are controlled at the genomic level remains poorly understood. Here we show that neuronal genes are associated with highly complex gene regulatory systems composed of independent cell-type- and cell-stage-specific regulatory elements that reside in expanded non-coding genomic domains. Mapping enhancer-promoter interactions revealed that motor neuron enhancers are broadly distributed across the large chromatin domains. This distributed regulatory architecture is not a unique property of motor neurons but is employed throughout the nervous system. The number of regulatory elements increased dramatically during the transition from invertebrates to vertebrates, suggesting that acquisition of new enhancers might be a fundamental process underlying the evolutionary increase in cellular complexity."
https://openalex.org/W3208807833,"Previous research has shown that the COVID-19 outbreak, social distancing, and lockdown can affect people's psychological well-being. The aims of this study were (1) to estimate the extent to which perceptions and expectations regarding the social, economic, and domestic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak are associated with psychological distress and (2) to identify some demographic, psychosocial, and economic factors associated with increased vulnerability to psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Chile. 1078 people participated in a telephone survey between May 30 and June 10, 2020. The sample is representative of the Chilean adult population. Psychological distress was assessed through a questionnaire of anxious and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4). We analyzed the data set using ordinary least-squares regression models, first estimating models for the entire sample, and then stratifying the sample into different groups to explore differences by gender and age. 19.2% of participants displayed significant psychological distress (PHQ-4 ≥ 6), with moderate to severe anxiety-depression symptoms being more prevalent in women than in men (23.9% vs 14.1%, χ2 16.78, p<0.001). The results of this study suggest that being a woman, feeling lonely and isolated, living in the areas hit hardest by the pandemic and lockdown, expecting a lack of income due to having to stop working as a consequence of the pandemic, and having a history of diagnosed mental disorders are significantly associated with psychological distress (p<0.05). The results of this study highlight the need to implement psychosocial programs to guard people's psychological well-being and social policies to address economic uncertainty during the current COVID-19 outbreak in Chile."
https://openalex.org/W3210592062,"Dysregulated metabolism is a hallmark of cancer that manifests through alterations in bioenergetic and biosynthetic pathways to enable tumor cell proliferation and survival. Tumor cells exhibit high rates of glycolysis, a phenomenon known as the Warburg effect, and an increase in glutamine consumption to support the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) tumors express high levels of glutaminase (GLS), the enzyme required for the first step in metabolic conversion of glutamine to glutamate and the entry of glutamine into the TCA cycle. We found that RCC cells are highly dependent on glutamine for proliferation, and this dependence strongly correlated with sensitivity to telaglenstat (CB-839), an investigational, first-in-class, selective, orally bioavailable GLS inhibitor. Metabolic profiling of RCC cell lines treated with telaglenastat revealed a decrease in glutamine consumption, which was concomitant with a decrease in the production of glutamate and other glutamine-derived metabolites, consistent with GLS inhibition. Treatment of RCC cells with signal transduction inhibitors everolimus (mTOR inhibitor) or cabozantinib (VEGFR/MET/AXL inhibitor) in combination with telaglenastat resulted in decreased consumption of both glucose and glutamine and synergistic anti-proliferative effects. Treatment of mice bearing Caki-1 RCC xenograft tumors with cabozantinib plus telaglenastat resulted in reduced tumor growth compared to either agent alone. Enhanced anti-tumor activity was also observed with the combination of everolimus plus telaglenastat. Collectively, our results demonstrate potent, synergistic, anti-tumor activity of telaglenastat plus signal transduction inhibitors cabozantinib or everolimus via a mechanism involving dual inhibition of glucose and glutamine consumption."
https://openalex.org/W3208462822,"Over the past four decades, China have experienced rapid economic growth but also a widening urban-rural income gap and deteriorating air quality. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2017, this paper investigates the effect of narrowing the urban-rural income gap on carbon emission reduction and pollution control by using OLS method. The empirical results indicate that: the narrowing of the urban-rural income gap has a positive impact on pollution control, while there are regional differences in the impact on carbon emission reduction. In the perspective of the whole country and central and western regions, the narrowing of the urban-rural income gap is conducive to carbon emission reduction. However, the narrowing of the urban-rural income gap increases carbon emissions in the eastern regions where economic development is at high level. This paper provides a theoretical basis and policy reference for promoting urban-rural integration and construction of ecological civilization."
https://openalex.org/W3211243880,"Although many long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) exhibit lineage-specific expression, the vast majority remain functionally uncharacterized in the context of development. Here, we report the first described human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines to repress (CRISPRi) or activate (CRISPRa) transcription during differentiation into all three germ layers, facilitating the modulation of lncRNA expression during early development. We performed an unbiased, genome-wide CRISPRi screen targeting thousands of lncRNA loci expressed during endoderm differentiation. While dozens of lncRNA loci were required for proper differentiation, most differentially expressed lncRNAs were not, supporting the necessity for functional screening instead of relying solely on gene expression analyses. In parallel, we developed a clustering approach to infer mechanisms of action of lncRNA hits based on a variety of genomic features. We subsequently identified and validated FOXD3-AS1 as a functional lncRNA essential for pluripotency and differentiation. Taken together, the cell lines and methodology described herein can be adapted to discover and characterize novel regulators of differentiation into any lineage."
https://openalex.org/W3209444948,"We investigated changes in the quantity and quality of time spent on various activities in response to the COVID-19-induced national lockdowns in the UK. We examined effects both in the first national lockdown (May 2020) and the third national lockdown (March 2021). Using retrospective longitudinal time-use diary data collected from a demographically diverse sample of over 760 UK adults in both lockdowns, we found significant changes in both the quantity and quality of time spent on broad activity categories (employment, housework, leisure). Individuals spent less time on employment-related activities (in addition to a reduction in time spent commuting) and more time on housework. These effects were concentrated on individuals with young children. Individuals also spent more time doing leisure activities (e.g. hobbies) alone and conducting employment-related activities outside normal working hours, changes that were significantly correlated with decreases in overall enjoyment. Changes in quality exacerbated existing inequalities in quantity of time use, with parents of young children being disproportionately affected. These findings indicate that quality of time use is another important consideration for policy design and evaluation."
https://openalex.org/W3209997871,"MicroRNA-3662 (miR-3662) is minimally expressed in normal human tissues but is highly expressed in all types of cancers, including breast cancer. As determined with The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset, miR-3662 expression is higher in triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) and African American breast cancers than in other breast cancer types. However, the functional role of miR-3662 remains a topic of debate. Here, we found that inhibition or knockout of endogenous, mature miR-3662 in TNBC cells suppresses proliferation and migration in vitro and tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Functional analysis revealed that, for TNBC cells, knockout of miR-3662 reduces the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Furthermore, using CRISPR-mediated miR-3662 activation and repression, dual-luciferase assays, and miRNA/mRNA immunoprecipitation assays, we established that HMG-box transcription factor 1 (HBP-1), a Wnt/β-catenin signaling inhibitor, is a target of miR-3662 and is most likely responsible for miR-3662-mediated TNBC cell proliferation. Our results suggest that miR-3662 has an oncogenic function in tumor progression and metastasis via an miR-3662-HBP1 axis, regulating the Wnt /β-catenin signaling pathway in TNBC cells. Since miR-3662 expression occurs a tumor-specific manner, it is a promising biomarker and therapeutic target for patients who have TNBCs with dysregulation of miR-3662, especially African Americans."
https://openalex.org/W3210972562,"Objective Determine the impact of long-term non-surgical weight loss maintenance on clinical relevance for osteoarthritis, cancer, opioid use, and depression/anxiety and healthcare resource utilization. Methods A cohort of adults receiving primary care within Geisinger Health System between 2001–2017 was retrospectively studied. Patients with ≥3 weight measurements in the two-year index period and obesity at baseline (BMI ≥30 kg/m 2 ) were categorized: Obesity Maintainers (reference group) maintained weight within +/-3%; Weight Loss Rebounders lost ≥5% body weight in year one, regaining ≥20% of weight loss in year two; Weight Loss Maintainers lost ≥5% body weight in year one, maintaining ≥80% of weight loss. Association with development of osteoarthritis, cancer, opioid use, and depression/anxiety, was assessed; healthcare resource utilization was quantified. Magnitude of weight loss among maintainers was evaluated for impact on health outcomes. Results In total, 63,567 patients were analyzed including 67% Obesity Maintainers, 19% Weight Loss Rebounders, and 14% Weight Loss Maintainers; median follow-up was 9.7 years. Time until osteoarthritis onset was delayed for Weight Loss Maintainers compared to Obesity Maintainers (Logrank test p &lt;0.0001). Female Weight Loss Maintainers had a 19% and 24% lower risk of developing any cancer (p = 0.0022) or obesity-related cancer (p = 0.0021), respectively. No significant trends were observed for opioid use. Weight loss Rebounders and Maintainers had increased risk (14% and 25%) of future treatment for anxiety/depression (both &lt;0.0001). Weight loss maintenance of &gt;15% weight loss was associated with the greatest decrease in incident osteoarthritis. Healthcare resource utilization was significantly higher for Weight Loss Rebounders and Maintainers compared to Obesity Maintainers. Increased weight loss among Weight Loss Maintainers trended with lower overall healthcare resource utilization, except for hospitalizations. Conclusions In people with obesity, sustained weight loss was associated with greater clinical benefits than regained short-term weight loss and obesity maintenance. Higher weight loss magnitudes were associated with delayed onset of osteoarthritis and led to decreased healthcare utilization."
https://openalex.org/W3209385093,"Addressing the problem of suicidal thoughts and behavior (STB) in adolescents requires understanding the associated risk factors. While previous research has identified individual risk and protective factors associated with many adolescent social morbidities, modern machine learning approaches can help identify risk and protective factors that interact (group) to provide predictive power for STB. This study aims to develop a prediction algorithm for STB among adolescents using the risk and protective factor framework and social determinants of health.The sample population consisted of more than 179,000 high school students living in Utah and participating in the Communities That Care (CTC) Youth Survey from 2011-2017. The dataset includes responses to 300+ questions from the CTC and 8000+ demographic factors from the American Census Survey for a total of 1.2 billion values. Machine learning techniques were employed to extract the survey questions that were best able to predict answers indicative of STB, using recent work in interpretable machine learning.Analysis showed strong predictive power, with the ability to predict individuals with STB with 91% accuracy. After extracting the top ten questions that most affected model predictions, questions fell into four main categories: familial life, drug consumption, demographics, and peer acceptance at school.Modern machine learning approaches provide new methods for understanding the interaction between root causes and outcomes, such as STB. The model developed in this study showed significant improvement in predictive accuracy compared to previous research. Results indicate that certain risk and protective factors, such as adolescents being threatened or harassed through digital media or bullied at school, and exposure or involvement in serious arguments and yelling at home are the leading predictors of STB and can help narrow and reaffirm priority prevention programming and areas of focused policymaking."
https://openalex.org/W3210998517,"Biosorption has been considered a promising technology for the treatment of industrial effluents containing heavy metals. However, the development of a cost-effective technique for biomass immobilization is essential for successful application of biosorption in industrial processes. In this study, a new method of reversible encapsulation of the highly pigmented biomass from Aspergillus nidulans mutant using semipermeable cellulose membrane was developed and the efficiency of the encapsulated biosorbent in the removal and recovery of copper ions was evaluated. Data analysis showed that the pseudo-second-order model better described copper adsorption by encapsulated biosorbent and a good correlation (r2 > 0.96) to the Langmuir isotherm was obtained. The maximum biosorption capacities for the encapsulated biosorbents were higher (333.5 and 116.1 mg g-1 for EB10 and EB30, respectively) than that for free biomass (92.0 mg g-1). SEM-EDXS and FT-IR analysis revealed that several functional groups on fungal biomass were involved in copper adsorption through ion-exchange mechanism. Sorption/desorption experiments showed that the metal recovery efficiency by encapsulated biosorbent remained constant at approximately 70% during five biosorption/desorption cycles. Therefore, this study demonstrated that the new encapsulation method of the fungal biomass using a semipermeable cellulose membrane is efficient for heavy metal ion removal and recovery from aqueous solutions in multiple adsorption-desorption cycles. In addition, this reversible encapsulation method has great potential for application in the treatment of heavy metal contaminated industrial effluents due to its low cost, the possibility of recovering adsorbed ions and the reuse of biosorbent in consecutive biosorption/desorption cycles with high efficiency of metal removal and recovery."
https://openalex.org/W3209019835,"The organic wine market is rapidly growing worldwide, both in terms of production and consumption. However, the scientific literature is not conclusive regarding differences in the elemental composition of wines according to their production method, including both major and trace elements. Minerals can be present in wine as a result of both anthropogenic and environmental factors. To date, this has not been evaluated in volcanic contexts, neither has the emergent issue of rare earths and other minority elements as potential sources of food contamination. This study using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses organic and conventional wines produced in the Canary Islands (Spain), an archipelago of volcanic origin, to compare their content of 49 elements, including rare earths and minority elements. Our results showed that organic wines presented lower potential toxic element content on average than their conventional counterparts, but differences were not significant. Geographical origin of the wine samples (island) was the only significant variable differentiating wine samples by their composition profiles. By comparing our data with the literature, no agreement was found in terms of differences between organic and conventionally-produced wines. This confirms that other factors prevail over elemental composition when considering differences between wine production methods. Regarding the toxicological profile of the wines, five samples (three organic and two conventional) exceeded the maximum limits established by international legislation. This highlights the need for stricter analytical monitoring in the Canary Islands, with a particular focus on Cu and Ni concentration, and potentially in other volcanic areas."
https://openalex.org/W3210851569,"Enhanced immune functioning in response to biodiversity may explain potential health benefits from exposure to green space. Using unique data on urban forest biodiversity at the zip code level for California measured from 2014 to 2019 we test whether greater diversity of street trees is associated with reduced death from cardiovascular disease. We find that urban forests with greater biodiversity measured via the Shannon Index at the genus level are associated with a lower mortality rate for heart disease and stroke. Our estimates imply that increasing the Shannon Index by one standard deviation (0.64) is associated with a decrease in the mortality rate of 21.4 per 100,000 individuals for heart disease or 13% and 7.7 per 100,000 individuals for stroke or 16%. Our estimates remain robust across several sensitivity checks. A policy simulation for tree planting in Los Angeles based on our estimates suggests that if these relationships were causal, investment in planting for a more biodiverse set of street trees would be a cost-effective way to reduce mortality related to cardiovascular disease in urban areas."
https://openalex.org/W3210983710,"There remains a large gender imbalance in the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce deriving from a leaky pipeline where women start losing interest and confidence in science and engineering as early as primary school. To address this disparity, the Science Research & Engineering Program (SREP) at Hathaway Brown School was established in 1998 to engage and expose their all-female high school students to STEM fields through an internship-like multi-year research experience at partnering institutions. We compare data from existing Hathaway Brown School SREP alumnae records from 1998-2018 (n = 495) to Non-SREP students and national datasets (National Center for Educational Statistics, National Science Foundation, and US Census data) to assess how SREP participation may influence persistence in the STEM pipeline and whether SREP alumnae attribute differences in these outcomes to the confidence and skill sets they learned from the SREP experience. The results reveal that women who participate in the SREP are more likely to pursue a major in a STEM field and continue on to a STEM occupation compared to non-SREP students, national female averages, and national subsets. Participants attribute their outcomes to an increase in confidence, establishment of technical and professional skills, and other traits strengthened through the SREP experience. These data suggest that implementing similar experiential programs for women in science and engineering at the high school stage could be a promising way to combat the remaining gender gap in STEM fields."
https://openalex.org/W3208736312,"Loss-of-function alterations of Neurofibromin 1 (NF1) activate RAS, a driver of colorectal cancer. However, the clinical implications of NF1 alterations are largely unknown. We performed a comprehensive molecular profiling of NF1-mutant colorectal cancer using data from 8150 patients included in a dataset of commercial CLIA-certified laboratory (Caris Life Sciences). In addition, NF1 expression levels were tested for associations with clinical outcomes using data from 431 patients in the CALGB/SWOG 80405 trial. In the Caris dataset, 2.2% of patients had pathogenic or presumed pathogenic NF1 mutations. NF1-mutant tumors more frequently harbored PIK3CA (25.0% vs. 16.7%) and PTEN mutations (24.0% vs. 4.2%) than wild type tumors. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that MAPK and PI3K pathway signatures were enriched in NF1-mutant tumors. In the CALGB/SWOG 80405 cohort, low NF1 expression was associated with poor prognosis, and high NF1 expression was associated with better efficacy of cetuximab than bevacizumab. Together, we revealed concurrent genetic alterations in the PI3K pathways in NF1-mutant tumors, suggesting the need to simultaneously block MAPK and PI3K pathways in treatment. The potential of NF1 alteration as a novel biomarker for targeted therapy was highlighted, warranting further investigations in clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W3208824176,"The infant mortality rate (IMR) is a critical indicator of population health, but its measurement is subject to response bias in countries without complete vital registration systems who rely instead on birth histories collected via sample surveys. One of the most salient bias is the fact that child deaths in these birth histories tend to be reported with a large amount of heaping at age 12 months. Because of this issue, analysts and international agencies do not directly use IMR estimates based on surveys such as Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS); they rely instead on mortality models such as model life tables. The use of model life tables in this context, however, is arbitrary, and the extent to which this approach appropriately addresses bias in DHS-based IMR estimates remains unclear. This hinders our ability to monitor IMR levels and trends in low-and middle-income countries. The objective of this study is to evaluate age heaping bias in DHS-based IMR estimates and propose an improved method for adjusting this bias.Our method relies on a recently-developed log-quadratic model that can predict age-specific mortality by detailed age between 0 and 5. The model's coefficients were derived from a newly constituted database, the Under-5 Mortality Database (U5MD), that represents the mortality experience of countries with high-quality vital registration data. We applied this model to 204 DHS surveys, and compared unadjusted IMR values to IMR values adjusted with the log-quadratic model as well as with the classic model life table approach. Results show that contrary to existing knowledge, age heaping at age 12 months rarely generates a large amount of bias in IMR estimates. In most cases, the unadjusted IMR values were not deviating by more than +/- 5% from the adjusted values. The model life table approach, by contrast, introduced an unwarranted, downward bias in adjusted IMR values. We also found that two regions, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, present age patterns of under-5 mortality that strongly depart from the experience represented in the U5MD. For these countries, neither the existing model life tables nor the log-quadratic model can produce empirically-supported IMR adjustments.Age heaping at age 12 months produces a smaller amount of bias in DHS-based IMR estimates than previously thought. If a large amount of age heaping is present in a survey, the log-quadratic model allows users to evaluate, and whenever necessary, adjust IMR estimates in a way that is more informed by the local mortality pattern than existing approaches. Future research should be devoted to understanding why Sub-Saharan African and South Asian countries have such distinct age patterns of under-five mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3209318346,"Miocene deposits of South America have yielded several species-rich assemblages of caviomorph rodents. They are mostly situated at high and mid- latitudes of the continent, except for the exceptional Honda Group of La Venta, Colombia, the faunal composition of which allowed to describe the late middle Miocene Laventan South American Land Mammal Age (SALMA). In this paper, we describe a new caviomorph assemblage from TAR-31 locality, recently discovered near Tarapoto in Peruvian Amazonia (San Martín Department). Based on mammalian biostratigraphy, this single-phased locality is unambiguously considered to fall within the Laventan SALMA. TAR-31 yielded rodent species found in La Venta, such as the octodontoid Ricardomys longidens Walton, 1990 (nom. nud.), the chinchilloids Microscleromys paradoxalis Walton, 1990 (nom. nud.) and M. cribriphilus Walton, 1990 (nom. nud.), or closely-related taxa. Given these strong taxonomic affinities, we further seize the opportunity to review the rodent dental material from La Venta described in the Ph.D. volume of Walton in 1990 but referred to as nomina nuda. Here we validate the recognition of these former taxa and provide their formal description. TAR-31 documents nine distinct rodent species documenting the four extant superfamilies of Caviomorpha, including a new erethizontoid: Nuyuyomys chinqaska gen. et sp. nov. These fossils document the most diverse caviomorph fauna for the middle Miocene interval of Peruvian Amazonia to date. This rodent discovery from Peru extends the geographical ranges of Ricardomys longidens, Microscleromys paradoxalis, and M. cribriphilus, 1,100 km to the south. Only one postcranial element of rodent was unearthed in TAR-31 (astragalus). This tiny tarsal bone most likely documents one of the two species of Microscleromys and its morphology indicates terrestrial generalist adaptations for this minute chinchilloid."
https://openalex.org/W3209638839,"Endometrial carcinoma (EC) is the most common gynecological cancer. However, there is currently no routinely used biomarker for differential diagnosis of malignant and premalignant endometrial lesions. Ten-eleven translocation (TET) proteins, especially TET1, were found to play a significant role in DNA demethylation, via conversion of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC). TET1, 5-mC, and 5-hmC expression profiles in endometrial carcinogenesis are currently unclear. We conducted a hospital-based retrospective review of the immunohistochemical expression of TET1, 5-mC, and 5-hmC in 181 endometrial samples. A ""high"" TET1 and 5-hmC expression score was observed in all cases of normal endometrium (100.0% and 100.0%, respectively) and in most samples of endometrial hyperplasia without atypia (90.9% and 78.8%, respectively) and atypical hyperplasia (90.6% and 93.8%, respectively), but a ""high"" score was found in only less than half of the EC samples (48.8% and 46.5%, respectively). The TET1 and 5-hmC expression scores were significantly higher in normal endometrium and premalignant endometrial lesions than in ECs (p < 0.001). A ""high"" 5-mC expression score was observed more frequently for ECs (81.4%) than for normal endometrium (40.0%), endometrial hyperplasia without atypia (51.5%), and atypical hyperplasia (53.1%) (p < 0.001). We also found that TET1 mRNA expression was lower in ECs compared to normal tissues (p = 0.0037). TET1 immunohistochemistry (IHC) scores were highly proportional to the TET1 mRNA levels and we summarize that the TET1 IHC scoring can be used for biomarker determinations. Most importantly, a higher TET1 score in EC cases was associated with a good overall survival (OS) rate, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.31 for death (95% confidence interval: 0.11-0.84). Our findings suggest that TET1, 5-mC, and 5-hmC expression is a potential histopathology biomarker for the differential diagnosis of malignant and premalignant endometrial lesions. TET1 is also a potential prognostic marker for EC."
https://openalex.org/W3210738505,"Objectives To determine whether a new triage system safely diverts a proportion of emergency department (ED) patients to a general practitioner cooperative (GPC). Methods Unblinded randomised controlled trial with weekends serving as clusters (three intervention clusters for each control). The intervention was triage by a nurse using a new extension to the Manchester Triage System assigning low-risk patients to the GPC. During intervention weekends, patients were encouraged to follow this assignment; it was not communicated during control weekends (all patients remained at the ED). The primary outcome was the proportion of patients assigned to and handled by the GPC during intervention weekends. The trial was randomised for the secondary outcome: the proportion of patients assigned to the GPC. Additional outcomes were association of these outcomes with possible confounders (study tool parameters, nurse, and patient characteristics), proportion of patients referred back to the ED by the GPC, hospitalisations, and performance of the study tool to detect primary care patients (the opinion of the treating physician was the gold standard). Results In the intervention group, 838/6294 patients (13.3%, 95% CI 12.5 to 14.2) were assigned to the GPC, in the control group this was 431/1744 (24.7%, 95% CI 22.7 to 26.8). In total, 599/6294 patients (9.5%, 95% CI 8.8 to 10.3) experienced the primary outcome which was influenced by the reason for encounter, age, and the nurse. 24/599 patients (4.0%, 95% CI 2.7 to 5.9) were referred back to the ED, three were hospitalised. Positive and negative predictive values of the studied tool during intervention weekends were 0.96 (95%CI 0.94 to 0.97) and 0.60 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.62).

https://openalex.org/W3210823799,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common brain malignancy in children, and is still responsible for significant mortality and morbidity. The aim of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of Disulfiram (DSF), an FDA-approved inhibitor of Aldehyde-Dehydrogenase (ALDH), and Copper (Cu++) in human SSH-driven and Group 3 MB. The molecular mechanisms, effect on cancer-stem-cells (CSC) and DNA damage were investigated in xenograft models.The cytotoxic and anti-CSC effects of DSF/Cu++ were evaluated with clonogenic assays, flow-cytometry, immunofluorescence, western-blotting. ONS76, UW228 (SHH-driven with Tp53m), D425med, D283 and D341 (Group 3) cell-lines were used. In vivo survival and nuclear protein localization protein-4 (NPL4), Ki67, Cleaved-Caspase-3, GFAP and NeuN expression were assessed in two Group 3 MB xenografts with immunohistochemistry and western-blotting.Significant in vitro cytotoxicity was demonstrated at nanomolar concentrations. DSF/Cu++ induced cell-death through NPL4 accumulation in cell-nucleus and buildup of poly-ubiquitylated proteins. Flow-cytometry demonstrated a significant decrease in ALDH+, Nestin+ and CD133+ following treatment, anti-CSC effect was confirmed in vitro and in vivo. DSF/Cu++ prolonged survival, and increased nuclear NPL4 expression in vivo.Our data suggest that this combination may serve as a novel treatment, as monotherapy or in combination with existing therapies, for aggressive subtypes of pediatric MB."
https://openalex.org/W3208140399,"The present work aims to strengthen the core competitiveness of industrial enterprises in the supply chain environment, and enhance the efficiency of inventory management and the utilization rate of inventory resources. First, an analysis is performed on the supply and demand relationship between suppliers and manufacturers in the supply chain environment and the production mode of intelligent plant based on cloud manufacturing. It is found that the efficient management of spare parts inventory can effectively reduce costs and improve service levels. On this basis, different prediction methods are proposed for different data types of spare parts demand, which are all verified. Finally, the inventory management system based on cloud-edge collaborative computing is constructed, and the genetic algorithm is selected as a comparison to validate the performance of the system reported here. The experimental results indicate that prediction method based on weighted summation of eigenvalues and fitting proposed here has the smallest error and the best fitting effect in the demand prediction of machine spare parts, and the minimum error after fitting is only 2.2%. Besides, the spare parts demand prediction method can well complete the prediction in the face of three different types of time series of spare parts demand data, and the relative error of prediction is maintained at about 10%. This prediction system can meet the basic requirements of spare parts demand prediction and achieve higher prediction accuracy than the periodic prediction method. Moreover, the inventory management system based on cloud-edge collaborative computing has shorter processing time, higher efficiency, better stability, and better overall performance than genetic algorithm. The research results provide reference and ideas for the application of edge computing in inventory management, which have certain reference significance and application value."
https://openalex.org/W3208824652,"Despite the interdependence of general and periodontal health, there is paucity of national representative data on the prevalence of periodontal diseases and their associated risk factors in Egyptian population. This cross-sectional study, thus, aimed to assess the prevalence of periodontitis and tooth loss among Egyptian adults and investigate the association between potential risk factors and periodontal diseases.A total of 5,954 adults aged ≥ 20 years were included in this study as a subsample from Egypt's national oral health survey. Periodontitis was diagnosed with Community Periodontal Index 'CPI' scores ≥3 and tooth loss not due to caries was included in the analysis. Socio-demographic data and information on behavioral factors and history of diabetes were gathered in a face-to-face interview. Logistic regression was done to interpret the impact of potential predictors on the incidence of the two selected outcome variables.The overall prevalence of periodontitis was 26% and regression analysis revealed that higher odds of periodontitis existed among illiterate participants (OR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.40-2.17), smokers (OR = 1.93; 95% CI: 1.69-2.20) and rural residents (OR = 1.16; 95% CI: 1.03-1.30). On the other hand, old age, frequency of dental attendance and history of diabetes were the main predictive factors for tooth loss.Among Egyptian adults, periodontal diseases were strongly associated with a multitude of modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors and inequalities in distribution of periodontal treatment needs were determined mainly by age, gender, level of education and residency location."
https://openalex.org/W3209048746,"To evaluate and compare the risk of emerging vector-borne diseases (VBDs), a Model for INTegrated RISK assessment, MINTRISK, was developed to assess the introduction risk of VBDs for new regions in an objective, transparent and repeatable manner. MINTRISK is a web-based calculation tool, that provides semi-quantitative risk scores that can be used for prioritization purposes. Input into MINTRISK is entered by answering questions regarding entry, transmission, establishment, spread, persistence and impact of a selected VBD. Answers can be chosen from qualitative answer categories with accompanying quantitative explanation to ensure consistent answering. The quantitative information is subsequently used as input for the model calculations to estimate the risk for each individual step in the model and for the summarizing output values (rate of introduction; epidemic size; overall risk). The risk assessor can indicate his uncertainty on each answer, and this is accounted for by Monte Carlo simulation. MINTRISK was used to assess the risk of four VBDs (African horse sickness, epizootic haemorrhagic disease, Rift Valley fever, and West Nile fever) for the Netherlands with the aim to prioritise these diseases for preparedness. Results indicated that the overall risk estimate was very high for all evaluated diseases but epizootic haemorrhagic disease. Uncertainty intervals were, however, wide limiting the options for ranking of the diseases. Risk profiles of the VBDs differed. Whereas all diseases were estimated to have a very high economic impact once introduced, the estimated introduction rates differed from low for Rift Valley fever and epizootic haemorrhagic disease to moderate for African horse sickness and very high for West Nile fever. Entry of infected mosquitoes on board of aircraft was deemed the most likely route of introduction for West Nile fever into the Netherlands, followed by entry of infected migratory birds."
https://openalex.org/W3209164016,"Locally advanced colon cancer (LACC) is associated with surgical challenges during R0 resection, increased postoperative complications, and unfavorable treatment outcomes. Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgical resection is an effective treatment strategy that can increase the complete surgical resection rate and improve the patient survival rate. This study investigated the efficacy and toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with LACC as well as the prognosis and long-term clinical outcomes of these patients.From January 2012 to July 2020, we retrospectively reviewed the real-world data of 75 patients with LACC who received neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen consisted of folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). The following data were obtained from medical records: patients' characteristics, pathologic results, toxicity, and long-term oncologic outcome.Of the 75 patients, 13 (17.3%) had pathologic complete responses. Hematologic adverse effects were the most common (grade 1 anemia: 80.0% and leukopenia: 82.7%). Conversely, grade 2 or 3 adverse effects were relatively uncommon (<10%). Pathologic N downstaging, ypT0, and pathologic complete responses were significant prognostic factors for patient survival. Multivariate analysis revealed that pathologic N downstaging was an independent predictor of patients' overall survival (P = 0.019). The estimated 5-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 68.6% and 50.6%, and the medians of overall and disease-free survival periods were 72.3 and 58.7 months, respectively. Moreover, patients with pathologic complete responses had improved overall survival (P = 0.039) and an improved local recurrence control rate (P = 0.042) but an unfavorable distant metastasis control rate (P = 0.666) in the long-term follow-up.The long-term oncologic outcome of patients with LACC following concurrent chemoradiotherapy is acceptable, and the adverse effects seem to be tolerable. Pathologic N downstaging was an independent prognostic factor for patients' overall survival. However, a large prospective, randomized control study is required to confirm the current results."
https://openalex.org/W3210089854,"Preterm neonatal mortality contributes substantially to the high neonatal mortality globally. In Uganda, preterm neonatal mortality accounts for 31% of all neonatal deaths. Previous studies have shown variability in mortality rates by healthcare setting. Also, different predictors influence the risk of neonatal mortality in different populations. Understanding the predictors of preterm neonatal mortality in the low-resource setting where we conducted our study could guide the development of interventions to improve outcomes for preterm neonates. We thus aimed to determine the incidence and predictors of mortality among preterm neonates born at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH) in South Western Uganda.We prospectively enrolled 538 live preterm neonates born at MRRH from October 2019 to September 2020. The neonates were followed up until death or 28 days, whichever occurred first. We used Kaplan Meier survival analysis to describe preterm neonatal mortality and Cox proportional hazards regression to assess predictors of preterm neonatal mortality over a maximum of 28 days of follow up.The cumulative incidence of preterm neonatal mortality was 19.8% (95% C.I: 16.7-23.5) at 28 days from birth. Birth asphyxia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 14.80; 95% CI: 5.21 to 42.02), not receiving kangaroo mother care (aHR, 9.50; 95% CI: 5.37 to 16.78), delayed initiation of breastfeeding (aHR, 9.49; 95% CI: 2.84 to 31.68), late antenatal care (ANC) booking (aHR, 1.81 to 2.52; 95% CI: 1.11 to 7.11) and no ANC attendance (aHR, 3.56; 95% CI: 1.51 to 8.43), vaginal breech delivery (aHR, 3.04; 95% CI: 1.37 to 5.18), very preterm births (aHR, 3.17; 95% CI: 1.24 to 8.13), respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (aHR, 2.50; 95% CI: 1.11 to 5.64) and hypothermia at the time of admission to the neonatal unit (aHR, 1.98; 95% CI: 1.18 to 3.33) increased the risk of preterm neonatal mortality. Attending more than 4 ANC visits (aHR, 0.35; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.96) reduced the risk of preterm neonatal mortality.We observed a high cumulative incidence of mortality among preterm neonates born at a low-resource regional referral hospital in Uganda. The predictors of mortality among preterm neonates were largely modifiable factors occurring in the prenatal, natal and postnatal period (lack of ANC attendance, late ANC booking, vaginal breech delivery, birth asphyxia, respiratory distress syndrome, and hypothermia at the time of admission to the neonatal unit, not receiving kangaroo mother care and delayed initiation of breastfeeding). These findings suggest that investment in and enhancement of ANC attendance, intrapartum care, and the feasible essential newborn care interventions by providing the warm chain through kangaroo mother care, encouraging early initiation of breastfeeding, timely resuscitation for neonates when indicated and therapies reducing the incidence and severity of RDS could improve outcomes among preterm neonates in this setting."

All previously reported bacterial GH65 enzymes are GPs, whereas all eukaryotic GH65 enzymes known are GHs. In addition, to date, no crystal structure of a GH65 GH has yet been reported. In this study, we use biochemical experiments and X-ray crystallography to examine the function and structure of a GH65 enzyme from Flavobacterium johnsoniae (FjGH65A) that shows low amino acid sequence homology to reported GH65 enzymes. We found that FjGH65A does not exhibit phosphorolytic activity, but it does hydrolyze kojibiose (α-1,2-glucobiose) and oligosaccharides containing a kojibiosyl moiety without requiring inorganic phosphate. In addition, stereochemical analysis demonstrated that FjGH65A catalyzes this hydrolytic reaction via an anomer-inverting mechanism. The three-dimensional structures of FjGH65A in native form and in complex with glucose were determined at resolutions of 1.54 and 1.40 Å resolutions, respectively. The overall structure of FjGH65A resembled those of other GH65 GPs, and the general acid catalyst Glu472 was conserved. However, the amino acid sequence forming the phosphate-binding site typical of GH65 GPs was not conserved in FjGH65A.

All GH65 GPs have been found in bacteria and catalyze phosphorolysis. The reaction mechanism of the GH65 GPs has been proposed to be similar to the inverting hydrolytic mechanism that uses a general acid and a general base as catalytic residues, that is, the single-displacement mechanism (Fig. 1A). In GH65 GPs, a phosphate nucleophile attack on the glycosidic bond of the substrate is assisted by proton donation from a general acid catalyst to the glycosidic oxygen (Fig. 1B). The inverting GPs also catalyze reverse phosphorolysis to form glycosidic bonds (14Nakai H. Kitaoka M. Svensson B. Ohtsubo K.

Flavobacterium johnsoniae is a Gram-negative soil bacterium whose genome has been sequenced, an analysis of which has revealed that it possesses several putative GHs to degrade polysaccharides (33McBride M.J.

In this study, we report a GH65 enzyme found in this bacterium that has a low amino acid sequence identity with other reported GH65 enzymes. This enzyme is not a GP but showed α-1,2-glucosidase activity, and its crystal structure, reported here, is the first structure from the GH65 GHs. This report therefore provides structural insight into substrate specificity and the catalytic mechanism of the GH65 GHs. F. johnsoniae possesses three genes for GH65 proteins, namely, Fjoh_1401, Fjoh_2641, and Fjoh_4428. A phylogenetic tree shows that Fjoh_2641 and Fjoh_4428 are included in a different clade from the bacterial GPs and eukaryotic GHs, whereas Fjoh_1401 belongs to the maltose phosphorylase clade (Fig. 2). Fjoh_4428 has lower than 33% sequence identity to known GH65 enzymes, including the GPs and GHs, and Fjoh_2641 lacks 288 amino acid residues at the N-terminal compared with Fjoh_4428. In this study, we therefore decided to characterize the function and structure of Fjoh_4428 (hereafter FjGH65A). FjGH65A without the N-terminal signal peptide was produced as a His6-tag-fused protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), and approximately 10 mg of purified FjGH65A was obtained from a cell lysate from a 500 ml culture. The theoretical molecular weight of FjGH65A was 76.4 kDa, which is consistent with the size of a single band for FjGH65A on an SDS-PAGE (Fig. S1A). Gel filtration chromatography showed that the molecular weight of FjGH65A was 433 ± 0.92 kDa, suggesting that this protein was a hexamer in solution (Fig. S1B). To determine the substrates of FjGH65A, we first examined its activity toward α-glucobiose because other known GH65 enzymes are active on α-glucosides. FjGH65A displayed activity against kojibiose and produced only glucose in the presence or absence of inorganic phosphate, but hydrolytic activity toward other α-glucobioses was not detected by TLC (Fig. 3). This result indicates that FjGH65A is not a GP but a GH specific for α-1,2-glucosidic linkage. Using the glucose oxidase–peroxidase method, we detected fainter hydrolytic activity for nigerose (0.063 ± 0.006 unit mg−1) than kojibiose (33.9 ± 1.2 unit mg−1); no activity was detected for the other disaccharides. We also found that FjGH65A hydrolyzed longer kojioligosaccharides, from kojitriose to kojipentaose, but a kinetic analysis showed that kcat/Km values for longer kojioligosaccharides were lower than for kojibiose (Table 1). In addition, FjGH65A showed no activity toward p-nitrophenyl α-glucopyranoside, which is a general substrate of exo-acting α-glucoside hydrolases. The optimum pH and temperature of FjGH65A were 5.5 and 40 °C, respectively (Fig. S2, A and B). The enzyme was stable (>80% residual activity) up to 50 °C after 30 min incubation and in a pH range of 4.5 to 9.0 (Fig. S2, C and D).Table 1Kinetic parameters of FjGH65AEnzymeSubstrateKm (mM)kcat (s−1)kcat/Km (s−1 mM−1)Relative activity (%)akcat/Km value for kojibiose is taken as 100%.FjGH65AKojibiose0.28 ± 0.01108 ± 0.1399100Kojitriose0.13 ± 0.0146.5 ± 0.127368Kojitetraose0.82 ± 0.0367.5 ± 1.294.623Kojipentaose0.96 ± 0.1044.5 ± 1.646.311G2G6G0.44 ± 0.0272.8 ± 1.421253G2G2G6G0.83 ± 0.0959.3 ± 2.271.518α-GlcF3.1 ± 0.256.1 ± 1.818.14.5YcjTbEscherichia coli K-12 kojibiose phosphorylase (51).Kojibiose1.051.11.1TbKPcThermoanaerobium brockii ATCC 35047 kojibiose phosphorylase (17).Kojibiose0.77170220a kcat/Km value for kojibiose is taken as 100%.b Escherichia coli K-12 kojibiose phosphorylase (51Mukherjee K.

Open table in a new tab Dextran is a polymer of α-D-glucose coupled primarily with α-1,6 linkages produced by several bacteria, including Leuconostoc and Streptococcus species, with varying amounts of side branches bound by α-1,2, α-1,3, or α-1,4 depending on the bacterial species and strain (34Khalikova E.

FjGH65A showed weak but obvious activity (1.38 ± 0.04 unit mg−1) against Leuconostoc citreum NRRL B-1299 α-glucan, which contains many α-1,2-linked branches in the α-1,6-linked main chain (35Bourne E.J.

By contrast, FjGH65A did not hydrolyze commercial dextran (which is rarely branched), L. citreum NRRL B-1355 α-glucan, composed of alternating α-1,3 and α-1,6 linkages (36Misaki A. Torii M. Sawai T.

Next, we hypothesized that FjGH65A could hydrolyze shorter oligosaccharides produced by the degradation of dextran-containing α-1,2 branches; therefore, 6-O-α-kojibiosylglucose (G2G6G) and 6-O-α-kojitriosylglucose (G2G2G6G) were enzymatically synthesized and used for analysis (see Supporting information). FjGH65A hydrolyzed G2G6G and G2G2G6G with kcat/Km values that were comparable but slightly lower than those for kojitriose and kojitetraose, respectively (Table 1). However, the types of linkages of the reducing ends were different from kojioligosaccharides. These results suggest that FjGH65A specifically recognizes the Glcα-1,2-Glc moiety in oligosaccharides and has relatively relaxed recognition for the reducing end of the oligosaccharides. To explore the catalytic mechanism of FjGH65A, the initial products of FjGH65A hydrolysis against kojibiose and α-D-glucopyranosyl fluoride (α-GlcF) were analyzed via normal-phase HPLC. This system can separate α-glucose and β-glucose (see Experimental procedures); the retention times of α-glucose and β-glucose were 10.0 and 10.5 min, respectively (Fig. S3). When unhydrolyzed kojibiose (0 min) was applied to the HPLC, two peaks were detected at retention times of 22 and 23 min with an area ratio of 49% and 51%, respectively (Fig. 4A). Considering the ratio of α-kojibiose and β-kojibiose in aqueous solution (38Roslund M.U. Tähtinen P. Niemitz M. Sjöholm R. Complete assignments of the 1H and 13C chemical shifts and JH,H coupling constants in NMR spectra of D-glucopyranose and all D-glucopyranosyl-D-glucopyranosides.Carbohydr. Res. 2008; 343: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), the 22 min peak and the 23 min peak likely corresponded to α-kojibiose and β-kojibiose, respectively. In comparison with the chromatograms of the 0 and 0.5 min reactions, a small peak at a retention time of 10.0 min and a large peak at a retention time of 10.5 min appeared, whereas the peaks at retention times of 22 and 23 min decreased. The amounts of glucose and kojibiose were determined from the peak areas in the chromatograms (Fig. 4B). From the slopes of these plots, FjGH65A digested α-kojibiose and β-kojibiose at a ratio of 1:0.8 and produces α-glucose and β-glucose at a ratio of 1:2.2. This result suggests that FjGH65A hydrolyzes kojibiose via an anomer-inverting mechanism (Fig. 4C). However, because these products were derived from both the nonreducing end α-glucose and the reducing-end α/β-glucose of α/β-kojibiose, it was difficult to clearly distinguish between them. To further elucidate the reaction mechanism, α-GlcF (kcat = 56.1 ± 1.8 s−1, Km = 3.1 ± 0.2 mM) was used as a substrate. Similarly, β-glucose initially accumulated in the 10 min reaction, whereas α-glucose was produced with a delay as the hydrolysis reaction progressed (Fig. 4D). This result strongly supported the hypothesis that FjGH65A is an α-glucoside hydrolase with an inverting mechanism (Fig. 4E). The crystal structure of FjGH65A was solved using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion method using a KAuCl4-soaked crystal because the molecular replacement method using the reported structures of GH65 GPs failed. We determined the structure of the enzyme in unliganded form and in complex with glucose at 1.54 and 1.40 Å resolutions, respectively (Table 2). Of all 681 amino acid residues, we were able to successfully model residues 23 to 681. The FjGH65A crystals belong to the space group C2 and contain three monomers (named MolA, MolB, and MolC) in the asymmetric unit. PISA (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/pisa/) analysis showed that FjGH65A forms a “dimer of trimers” hexamer related by the crystallographic two-fold rotational axis (Fig. 5A). This result is consistent with the gel-filtration chromatography result described above. The total surface area of the hexamer is 123,460 Å2, whereas the buried interface area is 31,510 Å2. All GH65 enzymes of known structure were dimers, and the amino acid residues responsible for hexamer formation in FjGH65A were not conserved in any reported GH65 enzymes (27Egloff M.P. Uppenberg J.

The monomer of FjGH65A comprises four regions as follows: an N-terminal β-sandwich domain (N-domain, residues 23–258), a helical linker region (residues 259–294), an (α/α)6-barrel catalytic domain (residues 301–641), and a C-terminal β-sheet domain (C-domain, residues 295–300 and 642–681) (Fig. 5B). A structural similarity search was then performed using the Dali server (39Holm L. DALI and the persistence of protein shape.Protein Sci. 2020; 29: 128-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). GH65 enzymes such as kojibiose phosphorylase from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus [CsKP, Protein Data Bank (PDB) 3WIR, Z-score = 38.8], 2-O-α-glucosylglycerol phosphorylase from Bacillus selenitireducens (BsGGP, PDB 4KTP, Z-score = 37.1), and maltose phosphorylase from Levilactobacillus brevis (LbMP, PDB 1H54, Z-score = 35.6) showed a high degree of structural similarity with FjGH65A although their amino acid sequence identities were only 28%, 23%, and 19%, respectively. GH15 enzymes such as glucodextranase from Arthrobacter globiformis (PDB 1ULV, Z-score = 22.0) and glucoamylase from Thermoanaerobacterium themosaccharolyticum (TtGA, PDB 1LF6, Z-score = 21.7) also showed significant structural similarity despite low amino acid sequence identities (17% and 20%, respectively). Although the structure of the FjGH65A N-domain is similar to those of the reported GH65 GPs, a loop (residues 71–78) in the N-domain is shorter than the corresponding region (residues 62–79) in LbMP (27Egloff M.P.

The loop is located in the interface of the “dimer of trimers” and is suggested to be involved in the hexamer formation of the FjGH65A. The FjGH65A C-domain consists of five β-strands, which are fewer than those of the other GH65 GPs.Table 2Data collection and refinement statisticsDataKAuCl4 derivativeNativeGlucose complexData collection BeamlinePF-AR NW12APF-AR NW12APF-AR NW12A Wavelength (Å)1.04021.00000.9795 Space groupC2C2C2 Unit cella (Å)121.3122.8123.5b (Å)194.8194.0194.2c (Å)110.4111.7112.0β (º)113.5116.6116.6 Resolution range (Å)50–2.0 (2.11–2.00)50–1.54 (1.62–1.54)50–1.40 (1.48–1.40) Total reflections1,016,7442,319,5813,073,386 Unique reflections154,913342,453451,842 Completeness (%)98.2 (96.2)99.7 (99.4)98.0 (96.6) Rmerge0.087 (0.744)0.050 (0.916)0.060 (0.755) Rmeas0.095 (0.852)0.54 (0.992)0.065 (0.820) Rpim0.038 (0.347)0.021 (0.379)0.025 (0.318) CC1/20.999 (0.982)0.999 (0.846)0.999 (0.810) I/σ11.6 (1.9)19.9 (2.3)15.6 (2.4) Redundancy6.6 (6.4)6.8 (6.7)6.8 (6.5)Refinement statistics Resolution (Å)1.541.40 Rwork0.1700.156 Rfree0.1920.170 Number of atomsProtein (MolA, B, C)5330, 5305, 53235300, 5280, 5282Ligand (MolA, B, C)40, 24, 4048, 48, 48Water14521668 Mean B factor (Å2)Protein (MolA, B, C)28.4, 35.4, 28.225.1, 27.4, 26.9Ligand (MolA, B, C)32.1, 35.5, 32.721.7, 24.7, 26.3Water35.432.5 RMSDBond lengths (Å)0.0090.009Bond angles (º)1.5011.526Ramachandran plotFavored (%)96.797.2Outliers (%)00 Clashscore1.981.7 MolProbity score1.161.06 Open table in a new tab During the refinement, the Fo − Fc electron density for β-glucose molecules was found in the glucose-complex structure of FjGH65A.

The most frequently reported clinical manifestation of Lyme carditis is cardiac conduction system disease. The goal of this study was to identify the incidence and predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation in patients hospitalized with Lyme disease.A retrospective cohort analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient sample was performed to identify patients hospitalized with Lyme disease in the US between 2003 and 2014. Patients with Lyme carditis were defined as those hospitalized with Lyme disease who also had cardiac conduction disease, acute myocarditis, or acute pericarditis. Patients who already had pacemaker implants at the time of hospitalization (N = 310) were excluded from the Lyme carditis subgroup. The primary study outcome was permanent pacemaker implantation. Secondary outcomes included temporary cardiac pacing, permanent pacemaker implant, and in-hospital mortality.Of the 96,140 patients hospitalized with Lyme disease during the study period, 10,465 (11%) presented with Lyme carditis. Cardiac conduction system disease was present in 9,729 (93%) of patients with Lyme carditis. Permanent pacemaker implantation was performed in 1,033 patients (1% of all Lyme hospitalizations and 11% of patients with Lyme carditis-associated conduction system disease). Predictors of permanent pacemaker implantation included older age (OR: 1.06 per 1 year; 95% CI:1.05-1.07; P<0.001), complete heart block (OR: 21.5; 95% CI: 12.9-35.7; P<0.001), and sinoatrial node dysfunction (OR: 16.8; 95% CI: 8.7-32.6; P<0.001). In-hospital mortality rate was higher in patients with Lyme carditis (1.5%) than in patients without Lyme carditis (0.5%).Approximately 11% of patients hospitalized with Lyme disease present with carditis, primarily in the form of cardiac conduction system disease. In this 12-year study, 1% of all hospitalized patients and 11% of those with Lyme-associated cardiac conduction system disease underwent permanent pacemaker implantation."
https://openalex.org/W3208211169,"In the face of recent wildfires across the Western United States, it is essential that we understand both the dynamics that drive the spatial distribution of wildfire, and the major obstacles to modeling the probability of wildfire over space and time. However, it is well documented that the precise relationships of local vegetation, climate, and ignitions, and how they influence fire dynamics, may vary over space and among local climate, vegetation, and land use regimes. This raises questions not only as to the nature of the potentially nonlinear relationships between local conditions and the fire, but also the possibility that the scale at which such models are developed may be critical to their predictive power and to the apparent relationship of local conditions to wildfire. In this study we demonstrate that both local climate–through limitations posed by fuel dryness (CWD) and availability (AET)–and human activity–through housing density, roads, electrical infrastructure, and agriculture, play important roles in determining the annual probabilities of fire throughout California. We also document the importance of previous burn events as potential barriers to fire in some environments, until enough time has passed for vegetation to regenerate sufficiently to sustain subsequent wildfires. We also demonstrate that long-term and short-term climate variations exhibit different effects on annual fire probability, with short-term climate variations primarily impacting fire probability during periods of extreme climate anomaly. Further, we show that, when using nonlinear modeling techniques, broad-scale fire probability models can outperform localized models at predicting annual fire probability. Finally, this study represents a powerful tool for mapping local fire probability across the state of California under a variety of historical climate regimes, which is essential to avoided emissions modeling, carbon accounting, and hazard severity mapping for the application of fire-resistant building codes across the state of California."

Paradoxically, most counties do not exhibit this same multiwave pattern. We aim to answer three research questions: (1) How many distinct clusters of counties exhibit similar COVID-19 patterns in the time-series of daily confirmed cases? (2) What is the geographic distribution of the counties within each cluster? and (3) Are county-level demographic, socioeconomic and political variables associated with the COVID-19 case patterns?We analyzed data from counties in the U.S. from March 1, 2020 to January 2, 2021. Time series clustering identified clusters in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. An explanatory model was used to identify demographic, socioeconomic and political variables associated with the outbreak patterns.Three patterns were identified from the cluster solution including counties in which cases are still increasing, those that peaked in the late fall, and those with low case counts to date. Several county-level demographic, socioeconomic, and political variables showed significant associations with the identified clusters.The pattern of the outbreak is related both to the geographic location within the U.S. and several variables including population density and government response.The reported pattern of cases in the U.S. is observed through aggregation of the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, suggesting that local trends may be more informative. The pattern of the outbreak varies by county, and is associated with important demographic, socioeconomic, political and geographic factors."

This study compares effects across different rheological approaches on hemodynamics, combined with a shear stress exposure history model of platelets within a stenosed porcine bifurcation. Simulations used both single/multiphase blood models to determine which approach best predicts phenomena associated with atherosclerosis and atherothrombosis. A novel Lagrangian platelet tracking model was used to evaluate residence time and shear history of platelets indicating likely regions of thrombus formation. Results show a decrease in area of regions with pathologically low time-averaged WSS with the use of multiphase models, particularly in a stenotic bifurcation. Significant non-Newtonian effects were observed due to low-shear and varying hematocrit levels found on the outer walls of the bifurcation and distal to the stenosis. Platelet residence time increased 11% in the stenosed artery, with exposure times to low-shear sufficient for red blood cell aggregation (>1.5 s). increasing the risk of thrombosis. This shows stenotic artery hemodynamics are inherently non-Newtonian and multiphase, with variations in hematocrit (0.163-0.617) and elevated vorticity distal to stenosis (+15%) impairing the function of the endothelium via reduced time-averaged WSS regions, rheological properties and platelet activation/adhesion."

The clinical indication for histological diagnosis was suspected metastasis in 46 patients. Technically, the radiological distance between the periphery of the lesion and the visceral pleura had to exceed the maximum diameter of the lesion for the patient to be included. A spiral wire was placed using intraoperative CT-based laser navigation to guide the thoracoscopic resection.The mean diameter of the lesions was 8.4 mm (SD 4.27 mm). 29.4 minutes (SD 28.5) were required on average for the wire placement and 42.3 minutes (SD 20.1) for the resection of the lesion. Histopathology confirmed the expected diagnosis in 30 of 52 lesions. In the remaining 22 lesions, 9 cases of primary lung cancer were detected while 12 patients showed a benign disease.Computer tomography assisted thoracoscopic surgery (CATS) enabled successful resection in all cases with minimal morbidity. The histological diagnosis led to a treatment change in 42% of the patients. The hybrid-CATS technique provides good access to deeply located small pulmonary nodules and could be particularly valuable in the emerging setting of lung cancer screening."

A model of Rv2421c in complex with nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide and magnesium ion was constructed and subject tovirtual ligand screening against the Prestwick Chemical Library and the ZINC database, which yielded 155 potential hit molecules. Of the 155 compounds identified five were pursued further using an IC50 based 3D-QSAR study. The 3D-QSAR model validated the inhibition properties of the five compounds based on R2 value of 0.895 and Q2 value of 0.944 compared to known inhibitors of Rv2421c. Higher binding affinities was observed for the novel ZINC13544129 and two FDA approved compounds (Novobiocin sodium salt, Sulfasalazine). Similarly, the total interaction energy was found to be the highest for Cromolyn disodium system (-418.88 kJ/mol) followed by Novobiocin (-379.19 kJ/mol) and Sulfasalazine with (-330.13 kJ/mol) compared to substrate DND having (-185.52 kJ/mol). Subsequent in vitro testing of the five compounds identified Novobiocin sodium salt with activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis at 50 μM, 25μM and weakly at 10μM concentrations. Novobiocin salt interacts with a MG ion and active site residues His20, Thr86, Gly107 and Leu164 similar to substrate DND of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Rv2421c.

UBL-UBA shuttle proteins (DDI1, RAD23, and DSK2) are important components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. By degrading ubiquitinated proteins, UBL-UBA shuttle proteins regulate many cellular processes. However, the specific processes regulated by UBL-UBA shuttle proteins remain elusive. Here, we revealed that the deletion of shuttle proteins results in a selective accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the nucleus and aberrant DNA replication. ROP18 was mistargeted and accumulated in the shuttle protein mutant strain, resulting in the recruitment of immunity-related GTPases to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM). Furthermore, the mistargeting of ROP18 and the recruitment of Irgb6 to the PVM were also observed in the DDI1 mutant strain. DDI1 is a nonclassical UBL-UBA shuttle protein homologous to the HIV-1 protease. Molecular docking showed that DDI1 was a potential target of HIV-1 protease inhibitors. However, these inhibitors blocked the growth of T gondii in vitro but not in vivo. In conclusion, the Toxoplasma UBL-UBA shuttle protein regulates several important cellular processes and the mistargeting of ROP18 may be a representative of the abnormal homeostasis caused by shuttle protein mutation."

However, objective data on this phenomenon are lacking. We aimed to examine the risk of in-hospital death caused by a reason other than the original reason for hospitalization and its association with underlying kidney disease in a nationwide inpatient database. Methods In this retrospective cohort study, we studied 639,556 Japanese adults who died in the hospital from 2012 to 2015, using data from Japan’s Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. We analyzed the discrepancy rate between reasons for hospital admission and death and associated factors using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) diagnostic codes and seven related categories. Results Among non-chronic kidney disease (CKD) (590,551), CKD (24,708), and end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (24,297) patients, the median age was 77 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 67–84 years), 83 years (IQR: 75–88), and 75 years (IQR: 67–81), and 25.7%, 30.3%, and 41.6% died from a reason other than the original reason for hospitalization, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses determined CKD/ESKD as the predominant risk factor for this discrepancy, rather than older age, male sex, obesity, and other comorbidities. Sankey diagrams that presented diagnostic changes from hospital admission to death revealed multiple wider segments connecting to different disease classifications, particularly to congestive and septic death in CKD and ESKD patients, respectively. Death owing to another disease classification led to an increase in the median length of hospital stay by 5–7 days and to a 1.3-–1.4-fold increase in medical costs across the populations. Conclusions A substantial proportion of patients with CKD and ESKD died during hospitalization for a reason other than their original reason for admission, leading to increased length of hospital stay and cost."

Prevalence of astrovirus (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 10.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.34-80.06) and norovirus GII (aOR 3.10; CI 1.62-5.92) was significantly higher in cases versus controls. Rotavirus was encountered only in cases. We did not find torovirus and there was no statistically significant relationship with cases for salivirus (aOR 1,67; (CI) 0.43-6.54)), adenovirus non-group F (aOR 1.20; CI 0.75-1.91), bocavirus (aOR 0.85; CI 0.05-13.64), enterovirus (aOR 0.83; CI 0.50-1.37), human parechovirus (aOR 1.61; CI 0.54-4.77) and sapovirus (aOR 1.15; CI 0.67-1.98). Though adenovirus group F (aOR 6.37; CI 0.80-50.92) and norovirus GI (aOR 2.22, CI: 0.79-6.23) are known enteropathogenic viruses and were more prevalent in cases than in controls, this did not reach significance in this study. The Ct value did not discriminate between carriage and disease in PCR-positive subjects.In our population, diagnostic gastroenteritis tests should screen for adenovirus group F, astrovirus, noroviruses GI and GII, and rotavirus. Case-control studies as ours are lacking and should also be carried out in populations from other epidemiological backgrounds."
https://openalex.org/W3208438182,"A synthetic microbial consortium called Effective Microorganisms (EM) consists mainly of photosynthetic bacteria, lactic acid bacteria and yeast. Various effects of EM∙XGOLD, a health drink produced by EM, on life cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum were described previously. Here, we report our attempt to identify the active principle, termed EMF, that brought about the observed effects. Throughout the purification processes, the presence of the active principle was monitored by promoted fruiting body formation. By liquid-liquid separation the activity was recovered in aqueous phase, which, after concentration, was further subjected to reverse-phase column chromatography. No activity was detected in any eluant, while almost all the activity was recovered in residual insoluble material. The application of conventional organic chemistry procedures to the residual fraction did not lead to any informative results. Acid treatment of the insoluble material produced air bubbles, suggesting it to be composed of some inorganic carbonate. Viewed under scanning electronmicroscope, the residue revealed spherical particles of μm size range. Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) Spectroscopy pointed to the existence, on the surface of the particles, of magnesium and, to a certain extent, of potassium. In separate experiments, acid treatment and alkali neutralization of EM∙XGOLD completely wiped out the stimulatory activity of fruiting body formation. These lines of evidence indicate these Mg, K-containing microparticles to be an active principle of EM culture extract. How these particles exert their effect is currently under intensive investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3208454366,"Infestation by a moth woodborer species is causing mortality of Sonneratia alba Sm. mangrove by tunneling through the inner bark, cambium and conductive tissue. Infestation leads to death of some infested branches, whereas in other cases infested branches have been observed to recover from infestation. We have used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to investigate the differences in macromolecule (polysaccharide and lignin) content present in branches that died (D) of the infestation, those that recovered (R) from the infestation and control branches (C) that were not subject to any infestation. Wood samples were taken from four sampling plots (A, B, C and D) in Gazi Bay (Kenya). From each of the four plots, 15 S. alba branches were taken from five trees, from which 1 cm thick discs were cut from each of these branches to be used as samples. To identify the most characteristic FTIR bands for the three groups of samples, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied on the transposed data matrix. Furthermore, canonical discriminant analysis was applied on the data considering the main FTIR band that would be identified through the PCA factors. Finally, One-way ANOVA and post hoc test were used to verify the significance of the observed trends. Branches that recovered from infestation had higher relative abundance of lignified cells. We conclude that insect-infested S. alba undergo changes related to the lignocellulosic contents. The infestation induces a decrease of the proportion of the polysaccharide content and an increase of the proportion of the lignin contents."
https://openalex.org/W3209613311,"In order to investigate the feasibility of using rice critical nitrogen concentration as a nitrogen nutrition diagnosis index, a two-year positioning field gradient experiment using four rice varieties and four nitrogen levels (0, 75, 150, 225 kg·ha-1 for early rice; 0, 90, 180, 270 kg·ha-1 for late rice) was conducted for early and late rice. The critical dilution curves (Nc%) of the double-cropped rice based on leaf dry matter (LDM) were constructed and verified using the field data. Two critical nitrogen dilution curves and nitrogen nutrition indexes (NNI) of rice LDM were constructed for early rice [Nc% = 2.66LDM-0.79, R2 = 0.88, NNI ranged between 0.29-1.74, and the average normalized root mean square error (n-RMSE = 19.35%)] and late rice [Nc% = 7.46LDM-1.42, R2 = 0.91, NNI was between 0.55-1.53, and the average (n-RMSE = 15.14%)]. The relationship between NNI and relative yield was a quadratic polynomial equation and suggested that the optimum nitrogen application rate for early rice was sightly smaller than 150 kg·ha-1, and that for late rice was about 180 kg·ha-1. The developed critical nitrogen concentration dilution curves, based on leaf dry matter, were able to diagnose nitrogen nutrition in the double-cropped rice region."
https://openalex.org/W3209825963,"Childhood epilepsy is a major public health problem worldwide. Even though anti-seizure medications (ASM) have been demonstrated to control seizures, children with epilepsy continue to have frequent seizures. There is a scarcity of data on seizure control status among pediatric epileptic patients in Ethiopia. The aim of this study was to assess seizure control status and associated factors among pediatric epileptic patients.A hospital based cross-sectional study was done on 261 pediatric epileptic patients being followed up at the University of Gondar Comprehensive and Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, from May 11 to August 11, 2019. The data were collected through caregiver interviews and patients' medical records. All independent variables with p value of ≤ 0.2 in univariate analysis were taken to multivariable analysis. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval was computed to see the predictors of seizure control status. Level of statistical significance was declared if p-value < 0.05.From a total of 261 patients, 159 (60.9%) were males and had a mean age was 10.16 ± 4.62 years. More than half (57.1%) of participants were urban dwellers. Almost all (98.5%) were diagnosed with generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Majority (75.1%) of the patients were on mono-therapy. Forty-six (17.6%) of the patients reported adverse effects related to ASMs. Two hundred-three (77.8%) of the patients were adherent to their medications. Nearly half (49.0%) of the patients had controlled seizures. Urban residency (AOR: 2.12; 95% CI: 1.15-3.89; P = 0.016), adherence to medication (AOR: 3.92; 95% CI: 1.84-8.36; P < 0.001), use of combined ASM(AOR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.14-0.59; P = 0. 001), durations of ASM use [2-5 years (AOR: 5.81; 95% CI: 2.89-11.70; P <0.001) and >5years (AOR: 4.80; 95% CI: 1.91-12.09; P = 0.001)]were significantly associated with seizure control status.Inadequate numbers of pediatric epileptic patients' at the Ethiopian neurologic clinic achieved seizure control. Coming from a rural area, non-adherence to ASMs, use of multiple ASMs, and the use of ASMs for <2years were found to have a significant association with poorer seizure control, needing special attention to get control of seizure. Caregivers should closely monitor and address any barriers that contribute to ASM non-adherence and adverse drug events."
https://openalex.org/W3210048284,"Young children have difficulty predicting a future physiological state that conflicts with their current state. This finding is explained by the fact that children are biased by their current state (e.g., thirsty and desiring water) and thus have difficulty imagining themselves in a different state (e.g., not thirsty and desiring pretzels) ""tomorrow,"" for example. Another potential explanation that we explore here is that young children have difficulty understanding how physiological states, like thirst, fluctuate over time. We asked 3-, 4- and 5-year-olds (Experiment 1) and adults (Experiment 2) to predict what a thirsty Experimenter-who preferred crisps to water-would want (""water"" or ""crisps"") ""right now"" and ""tomorrow."" Only adults correctly predicted someone else's future desires when this person's future and current desires conflicted. In contrast, both adults and children in the control groups (in which the Experimenter was not thirsty) had no difficulty predicting that the Experimenter would want crisps ""right now"" and ""tomorrow."" Our findings suggest that children's difficulty predicting future desires cannot solely be attributed to their being biased by their current state since the children in our study were, themselves, not thirsty. We discuss our results in the context of children's difficulty understanding fluctuations in physiological states."
https://openalex.org/W3210863386,"Infectious diseases and widespread outbreaks influence different sectors of the economy, including the stock market. In this article, we investigate the effect of EBOV and COVID-19 outbreaks on stock market indices. We employ time-varying and constant bivariate copula methods to measure the dependence structure between the infectious disease equity market volatility index (IEMV) and the stock market indices of several sectors. The results show that the financial and communication services sectors have the highest and the lowest negative dependency on IEMV during the Ebola virus (EBOV) pandemic, respectively. However, the health care and energy sectors have the highest and lowest negative dependency on IEMV during the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. Therefore, the results confirm the heterogeneous time-varying dependency between infectious diseases and the stock market indices. The finding of our study contributes to the ongoing literature on the impact of disease outbreaks, especially the novel coronavirus outbreak on global large-cap companies in the stock market."
https://openalex.org/W3211092257,"Various proteins form nanostructures exhibiting unique functions, making them attractive as next-generation materials. Ferritin is a hollow spherical protein that incorporates iron ions. Here, we found that hydrogels are simply formed from concentrated apoferritin solutions by acid denaturation and subsequent neutralization. The water content of the hydrogel was approximately 80%. The apoferritin hydrogel did not decompose in the presence of 1 M HCl, 2-mercaptoethanol, or methanol but was dissolved in the presence of 1 M NaOH, by heating at 80°C, or by treatment with trypsin or 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The Young's modulus of the hydrogel was 20.4 ± 12.1 kPa according to local indentation experimentes using atomic force microscopy, indicating that the hydrogel was relatively stiff. Transition electron microscopy measurements revealed that a fibrous network was constructed in the hydrogel. The color of the hydrogel became yellow-brown upon incubation in the presence of Fe3+ ions, indicating that the hydrogel adsorbed the Fe3+ ions. The yellow-brown color of the Fe3+-adsorbed hydrogel did not change upon incubation in pure water, whereas it became pale by incubating it in the presence of 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The apoferritin hydrogel also adsorbed Co2+ and Cu2+ ions and released them in the presence of EDTA, while it adsorbed less Ni2+ ions; more Fe3+ ions adsorbed to the apoferritin hydrogel than other metal ions, indicating that the hydrogel keeps the iron storage characteristic of ferritin. These results demonstrate a new property of ferritin: the ability to form a hydrogel that can adsorb/desorb metal ions, which may be useful in designing future biomaterials."
https://openalex.org/W3208083718,"Among the challenges of sustainable management of meat production, the key issue is to improve the energy efficiency of production processes, which will consequently affect the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Such effects are achieved by combining various chilling systems with electrical stimulation that determines the quality of meat at the slaughter stage. The novelties of the research undertaken included determining the impact of various variants of meat production (chilling method: slow, fast, accelerated + HVES/NES) on changes in the basic (industrial) quality indicators (pH and temperature) of beef produced from Polish Holstein-Friesian breed cattle, and then indicating the optimal variant for energy-efficient (sustainable) beef production. The HVES and the fast chilling method yielded positive economic (meat weight loss), technological (high quality, hot-boning), energetic (lower electricity consumption), and organizational effects (reduced chilling and storage surfaces and expenditures for staff wages) compared to the slow and accelerated methods. Reaching the desired final temperature with an increased amount of chilled meat enables obtaining a few-fold decrease in the specific energy consumption and a higher energy efficiency of the process. This allows recommending the above actions to be undertaken by entrepreneurs in the pursuit of sustainable meat production."
https://openalex.org/W3208160990,"An experiment was conducted to evaluate the feed intake, nutrient digestibility and selected rumen parameters in feedlot bulls fed diets containing different feed additives. Six rumen-cannulated Nellore bulls (age = 8 ± 1.0 months; initial BW = 225 ± 13.2 kg) were distributed in a 6 × 6 Latin square design. Six experimental diets based on 30% corn silage and 70% concentrate on a dry matter (DM) basis were evaluated. Diets differed in feed additive on a DM basis, as follows: 1.4% bicarbonate and magnesium oxide in 3:1 ratio (BOX); 36 ppm lasalocid sodium (LAS); 30 ppm monensin sodium (MON); 25 ppm virginiamycin (VIR); 30 ppm monensin sodium plus 25 ppm virginiamycin (MV); and 3.15% commercial mineral supplement containing D-limonene and exogenous α-amylase (EOA). The experiment lasted 144 d, with six periods of 24 d. Each period consisted of 14 d for dietary adaptation, 3 d for feces and urine collection, and 7 d for omasal and ruminal digesta collection. Bulls fed the BOX diet showed greater ( P &lt; 0.05) intake of DM, organic matter (OM), neutral detergent fiber (apNDF), crude protein (CP), and starch compared to the other diets. Diets with LAS, MON, VIR, MV, or EOA did not influence ( P &gt; 0.05) the DM, OM, apNDF, CP, or starch intake of feedlot bulls. Bulls fed the EOA diet showed greater (trend; P = 0.09) ruminal digestibility of starch compared to the other diets. The feed additives did not affect ( P &gt; 0.05) the intestinal or total tract digestibility of starch, rumen pH, microbial efficiency, total rumen fluid, dilution rate, rate of intake, rate of degradation, or passage rate of the DM, OM, apNDF, and starch. In conclusion, LAS, MON, VIR, MV, and EOA diets reduced nutrient intake compared to BOX. Although all feed additives presented similar effects on rumen pH, temperature, and kinetics the presence of exogenous α-amylase in the EOA diet may increase ruminal starch digestibility and apparent total tract digestibility of DM and OM."
https://openalex.org/W3208675003,"In this paper, the stability of the queueing system with the dropping function is studied. In such system, every incoming job may be dropped randomly, with the probability being a function of the queue length. The main objective of the work is to find an easy to use condition, sufficient for the instability of the system, under assumption of Poisson arrivals and general service time distribution. Such condition is found and proven using a boundary for the dropping function and analysis of the embedded Markov chain. Applicability of the proven condition is demonstrated on several examples of dropping functions. Additionally, its correctness is confirmed using a discrete-event simulator."
https://openalex.org/W3210440444,"Objectives This study documents trends in risk-adjusted quality and cost for a variety of inpatient surgical procedures among Medicare beneficiaries from 2002 through 2015, which can provide valuable insight on future strategies to improve public health and health care. Methods We focused on 11 classes of inpatient surgery, defined by the Agency for Health Research and Quality’s (AHRQ’s) Clinical Classification System. The surgical classes studied included a wide range of surgeries, including tracheostomy, heart valve procedures, colorectal resection, and wound debridement, among others. For each surgical class, we assessed trends in treatment costs and quality outcomes, as defined by 30-day survival without unplanned readmissions, among Medicare beneficiaries receiving these procedures during hospital stays. Quality and costs were adjusted for patient severity based on demographics, comorbidities, and community context. We also explored surgical innovations of these 11 classes of inpatient surgery from 2002–2015. Results We found significant improvements in quality for 7 surgical classes, ranging from 0.08% (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) to 0.74% (heart valve procedures) per year. Changes in cost varied by surgery, the significant decrease in cost ranged from -2.59% (tracheostomy) to -0.34% (colorectal resection) per year. Treatment innovation occurred with respect to surgical procedures utilized for heart valve procedures and colorectal resection, which may be associated with the decrease in surgical cost. Conclusions Our results suggest that there was significant quality improvement for 7 surgery categories over the 14-year study period. Costs decreased significantly for 6 surgery categories, and increased significantly for 3 other categories."
