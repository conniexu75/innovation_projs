https://openalex.org/W2058651702,"In Arabidopsis thaliana, the rhythm of sugar production by photosynthesis sets the timing of the circadian clock, by regulating the expression of circadian clock genes. In plants, the production of sugar by photosynthesis is a key metabolic output of the circadian clock. This study demonstrates that the rhythmic endogenous sugar signals can set the timing of the circadian clock in Arabidopsis by regulating the expression of circadian clock genes. The authors propose the concept of a 'metabolic dawn' that describes the resetting of the circadian clock in response to a peak in endogenous sugars produced by photosynthesis. Circadian clocks provide a competitive advantage in an environment that is heavily influenced by the rotation of the Earth1,2, by driving daily rhythms in behaviour, physiology and metabolism in bacteria, fungi, plants and animals3,4. Circadian clocks comprise transcription–translation feedback loops, which are entrained by environmental signals such as light and temperature to adjust the phase of rhythms to match the local environment3. The production of sugars by photosynthesis is a key metabolic output of the circadian clock in plants2,5. Here we show that these rhythmic, endogenous sugar signals can entrain circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis thaliana by regulating the gene expression of circadian clock components early in the photoperiod, thus defining a ‘metabolic dawn’. By inhibiting photosynthesis, we demonstrate that endogenous oscillations in sugar levels provide metabolic feedback to the circadian oscillator through the morning-expressed gene PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7), and we identify that prr7 mutants are insensitive to the effects of sucrose on the circadian period. Thus, photosynthesis has a marked effect on the entrainment and maintenance of robust circadian rhythms in A. thaliana, demonstrating that metabolism has a crucial role in regulation of the circadian clock."
https://openalex.org/W2074261331,"Mutations in SHANK3 and large duplications of the region spanning SHANK3 both cause a spectrum of neuropsychiatric disorders, indicating that proper SHANK3 dosage is critical for normal brain function. However, SHANK3 overexpression per se has not been established as a cause of human disorders because 22q13 duplications involve several genes. Here we report that Shank3 transgenic mice modelling a human SHANK3 duplication exhibit manic-like behaviour and seizures consistent with synaptic excitatory/inhibitory imbalance. We also identified two patients with hyperkinetic disorders carrying the smallest SHANK3-spanning duplications reported so far. These findings indicate that SHANK3 overexpression causes a hyperkinetic neuropsychiatric disorder. To probe the mechanism underlying the phenotype, we generated a Shank3 in vivo interactome and found that Shank3 directly interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to increase F-actin levels in Shank3 transgenic mice. The mood-stabilizing drug valproate, but not lithium, rescues the manic-like behaviour of Shank3 transgenic mice raising the possibility that this hyperkinetic disorder has a unique pharmacogenetic profile."
https://openalex.org/W2170602140,"Minimal-excitation fermionic quasiparticles are created by applying a potential with Lorentzian time dependence to the contact of a narrow constriction in a two-dimensional electron gas. The on-demand generation of pure quantum excitations, important for the operation of quantum systems, is particularly difficult for fermions. This is because perturbations tend to result in a complex superposition of particle and hole excitations. However, it was predicted by Leonid Levitov nearly twenty years ago that it should be possible to generate a minimal excitation, a quasiparticle with only one particle and no hole. The authors report the on-demand generation of such quasiparticles, which they term 'levitons', in an electronic system. They envisage that levitons will find application in quantum information and fundamental studies. The on-demand generation of pure quantum excitations is important for the operation of quantum systems, but it is particularly difficult for a system of fermions. This is because any perturbation affects all states below the Fermi energy, resulting in a complex superposition of particle and hole excitations. However, it was predicted nearly 20 years ago1,2,3 that a Lorentzian time-dependent potential with quantized flux generates a minimal excitation with only one particle and no hole. Here we report that such quasiparticles (hereafter termed levitons) can be generated on demand in a conductor by applying voltage pulses to a contact. Partitioning the excitations with an electronic beam splitter generates a current noise that we use to measure their number. Minimal-excitation states are observed for Lorentzian pulses, whereas for other pulse shapes there are significant contributions from holes. Further identification of levitons is provided in the energy domain with shot-noise spectroscopy, and in the time domain with electronic Hong–Ou–Mandel noise correlations4,5,6,7,8. The latter, obtained by colliding synchronized levitons on a beam splitter, exemplifies the potential use of levitons for quantum information: using linear electron quantum optics9 in ballistic conductors, it is possible to imagine flying-qubit10,11 operation in which the Fermi statistics are exploited12,13,14 to entangle synchronized electrons emitted by distinct sources15,16,17,18. Compared with electron sources based on quantum dots19,20,21, the generation of levitons does not require delicate nanolithography, considerably simplifying the circuitry for scalability. Levitons are not limited to carrying a single charge, and so in a broader context n-particle levitons could find application in the study of full electron counting statistics22,23,24,25. But they can also carry a fraction of charge if they are implemented in Luttinger liquids3 or in fractional quantum Hall edge channels26; this allows the study of Abelian and non-Abelian quasiparticles in the time domain. Finally, the generation technique could be applied to cold atomic gases27,28, leading to the possibility of atomic levitons."

https://openalex.org/W2094871238,"Out of several dozen z > 7 candidate galaxies observed spectroscopically, only five have been confirmed via Lyman-alpha emission, at z=7.008, 7.045, 7.109, 7.213 and 7.215. The small fraction of confirmed galaxies may indicate that the neutral fraction in the intergalactic medium (IGM) rises quickly at z > 6.5, as Lyman-alpha is resonantly scattered by neutral gas. However, the small samples and limited depth of previous observations makes these conclusions tentative. Here we report the results of a deep near-infrared spectroscopic survey of 43 z > 6.5 galaxies. We detect only a single galaxy, confirming that some process is making Lyman-alpha difficult to detect. The detected emission line at 1.0343 um is likely to be Lyman-alpha emission, placing this galaxy at a redshift z = 7.51, an epoch 700 million years after the Big Bang. This galaxy's colors are consistent with significant metal content, implying that galaxies become enriched rapidly. We measure a surprisingly high star formation rate of 330 Msol/yr, more than a factor of 100 greater than seen in the Milky Way. Such a galaxy is unexpected in a survey of our size, suggesting that the early universe may harbor more intense sites of star-formation than expected."
https://openalex.org/W1989029018,"Macrophage activation is a central event in immune responses. Macrophages undergoing classical activation (M1 macrophages) are proinflammatory, whereas alternatively activated macrophages (M2 macrophages) are generally anti-inflammatory. miRNAs play important regulatory roles in inflammatory response. However, the manner in which miRNAs regulate macrophage activation in response to different environmental cues has not been well defined. In this study, we found that M-BMM macrophages (M2) express greater levels of miR-125a-5p than do GM-BMM macrophages (M1). Stimulation of macrophages through TLR2 and TLR4 but not through TLR3 enhanced miR-125a-5p expression. Up-regulation of miR-125a-5p after TLR2/4 activation requires the adaptor MYD88 but not TRIF. Overexpression of miR-125a-5p diminished M1 phenotype expression induced by LPS but promoted M2 marker expression induced by IL-4. In contrast, knockdown of miR-125a-5p promoted M1 polarization and diminished IL-4-induced M2 marker expression. We found that miR-125a-5p targets KLF13, a transcriptional factor that has an important role in T lymphocyte activation and inflammation. KLF13 knockdown had similar effects on M1 activation as did miR-125a-5p overexpression. In addition, miR-125a-5p regulates phagocytic and bactericidal activities of macrophages. Our data suggest that miR-125a-5p has an important role in suppressing classical activation of macrophages while promoting alternative activation."
https://openalex.org/W2079077279,"Kramers developed the theory on how chemical reaction rates are influenced by the viscosity of the medium. At the viscosity of water, the kinetics of unimolecular reactions are described by diffusion of a Brownian particle over a free-energy barrier separating reactants and products. For reactions in solution this famous theory extended Eyring's transition state theory, and is widely applied in physics, chemistry and biology, including to reactions as complex as protein folding. Because the diffusion coefficient of Kramers' theory is determined by the dynamics in the sparsely populated region of the barrier top, its properties have not been directly measured for any molecular system. Here we show that the Kramers diffusion coefficient and free-energy barrier can be characterized by measuring the temperature- and viscosity-dependence of the transition path time for protein folding. The transition path is the small fraction of an equilibrium trajectory for a single molecule when the free-energy barrier separating two states is actually crossed. Its duration, the transition path time, can now be determined from photon trajectories for single protein molecules undergoing folding/unfolding transitions. Our finding of a long transition path time with an unusually small solvent viscosity dependence suggests that internal friction as well as solvent friction determine the Kramers diffusion coefficient for α-helical proteins, as opposed to a breakdown of his theory, which occurs for many small-molecule reactions. It is noteworthy that the new and fundamental information concerning Kramers' theory and the dynamics of barrier crossings obtained here come from experiments on a protein rather than a much simpler chemical or physical system."
https://openalex.org/W2090797443,"Transcription of ribosomal RNA by RNA polymerase (Pol) I initiates ribosome biogenesis and regulates eukaryotic cell growth. The crystal structure of Pol I from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae at 2.8 Å resolution reveals all 14 subunits of the 590-kilodalton enzyme, and shows differences to Pol II. An ‘expander’ element occupies the DNA template site and stabilizes an expanded active centre cleft with an unwound bridge helix. A ‘connector’ element invades the cleft of an adjacent polymerase and stabilizes an inactive polymerase dimer. The connector and expander must detach during Pol I activation to enable transcription initiation and cleft contraction by convergent movement of the polymerase ‘core’ and ‘shelf’ modules. Conversion between an inactive expanded and an active contracted polymerase state may generally underlie transcription. Regulatory factors can modulate the core–shelf interface that includes a ‘composite’ active site for RNA chain initiation, elongation, proofreading and termination. The crystal structure of the complete 14-subunit RNA polymerase (Pol) I from yeast is determined, providing insights into its unique architecture and the possible functional roles of its components. RNA polymerase I (Pol I) transcribes ribosomal RNA which is critically required for ribosome assembly, and the enzyme is therefore a major determinant of protein biosynthesis and cell growth. Mis-regulation of Pol I has been associated with several types of cancer, and Pol I is an emerging target for anticancer drugs. In this issue of Nature, two groups, working independently, present the X-ray crystal structure of the complete 14-subunit Pol I from yeast, determined at 3.0 Å and 2.8 Å resolution. The basic architecture of Pol I resembles those of Pol II and Pol III, but its DNA-binding cleft adopts a wider conformation than seen in the other RNA polymerases, and other unique features also provide insights into the functional roles of its components."
https://openalex.org/W2043425632,"Food intake increases the activity of hepatic de novo lipogenesis, which mediates the conversion of glucose to fats for storage or use. In mice, this program follows a circadian rhythm that peaks with nocturnal feeding and is repressed by Rev-erbα/β and an HDAC3-containing complex during the day. The transcriptional activators controlling rhythmic lipid synthesis in the dark cycle remain poorly defined. Disturbances in hepatic lipogenesis are also associated with systemic metabolic phenotypes, suggesting that lipogenesis in the liver communicates with peripheral tissues to control energy substrate homeostasis. Here we identify a PPARδ-dependent de novo lipogenic pathway in the liver that modulates fat use by muscle via a circulating lipid. The nuclear receptor PPARδ controls diurnal expression of lipogenic genes in the dark/feeding cycle. Liver-specific PPARδ activation increases, whereas hepatocyte-Ppard deletion reduces, muscle fatty acid uptake. Unbiased metabolite profiling identifies phosphatidylcholine 18:0/18:1 (PC(18:0/18:1) as a serum lipid regulated by diurnal hepatic PPARδ activity. PC(18:0/18:1) reduces postprandial lipid levels and increases fatty acid use through muscle PPARα. High-fat feeding diminishes rhythmic production of PC(18:0/18:1), whereas PC(18:0/18:1) administration in db/db mice (also known as Lepr(-/-)) improves metabolic homeostasis. These findings reveal an integrated regulatory circuit coupling lipid synthesis in the liver to energy use in muscle by coordinating the activity of two closely related nuclear receptors. These data implicate alterations in diurnal hepatic PPARδ-PC(18:0/18:1) signalling in metabolic disorders, including obesity."

https://openalex.org/W1968354447,"β-Thalassemia (β-Thal) is a group of life-threatening blood disorders caused by either point mutations or deletions of nucleotides in β-globin gene (HBB). It is estimated that 4.5% of the population in the world carry β-Thal mutants (1), posing a persistent threat to public health. The generation of patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and subsequent correction of the disease-causing mutations offer an ideal therapeutic solution to this problem. However, homologous recombination-based gene correction in human iPSCs remains largely inefficient. Here, we describe a robust process combining efficient generation of integration-free β-Thal iPSCs from the cells of patients and transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN)-based universal correction of HBB mutations in situ. We generated integration-free and gene-corrected iPSC lines from two patients carrying different types of homozygous mutations and showed that these iPSCs are pluripotent and have normal karyotype. We showed that the correction process did not generate TALEN-induced off targeting mutations by sequencing. More importantly, the gene-corrected β-Thal iPS cell lines from each patient can be induced to differentiate into hematopoietic progenitor cells and then further to erythroblasts expressing normal β-globin. Our studies provide an efficient and universal strategy to correct different types of β-globin mutations in β-Thal iPSCs for disease modeling and applications."
https://openalex.org/W2171679939,"Many secretory proteins are targeted by signal sequences to a protein-conducting channel, formed by prokaryotic SecY or eukaryotic Sec61 complexes, and are translocated across the membrane during their synthesis. Crystal structures of the inactive channel show that the SecY subunit of the heterotrimeric complex consists of two halves that form an hourglass-shaped pore with a constriction in the middle of the membrane and a lateral gate that faces the lipid phase. The closed channel has an empty cytoplasmic funnel and an extracellular funnel that is filled with a small helical domain, called the plug. During initiation of translocation, a ribosome-nascent chain complex binds to the SecY (or Sec61) complex, resulting in insertion of the nascent chain. However, the mechanism of channel opening during translocation is unclear. Here we have addressed this question by determining structures of inactive and active ribosome-channel complexes with cryo-electron microscopy. Non-translating ribosome-SecY channel complexes derived from Methanocaldococcus jannaschii or Escherichia coli show the channel in its closed state, and indicate that ribosome binding per se causes only minor changes. The structure of an active E. coli ribosome-channel complex demonstrates that the nascent chain opens the channel, causing mostly rigid body movements of the amino- and carboxy-terminal halves of SecY. In this early translocation intermediate, the polypeptide inserts as a loop into the SecY channel with the hydrophobic signal sequence intercalated into the open lateral gate. The nascent chain also forms a loop on the cytoplasmic surface of SecY rather than entering the channel directly."
https://openalex.org/W2005401186,"Antimicrobial action of nanomaterials is typically assigned to the nanomaterial composition, size and/or shape, whereas influence of complex corona stabilizing the nanoparticle surface is often neglected. We demonstrate sequential surface functionalization of tyrosine-reduced gold nanoparticles (AuNPsTyr) with polyoxometalates (POMs) and lysine to explore controlled chemical functionality-driven antimicrobial activity. Our investigations reveal that highly biocompatible gold nanoparticles can be tuned to be a strong antibacterial agent by fine-tuning their surface properties in a controllable manner. The observation from the antimicrobial studies on a gram negative bacterium Escherichia coli were further validated by investigating the anticancer properties of these step-wise surface-controlled materials against A549 human lung carcinoma cells, which showed a similar toxicity pattern. These studies highlight that the nanomaterial toxicity and biological applicability are strongly governed by their surface corona."
https://openalex.org/W1981078074,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is one of the most deadly types of cancer. To date, the best clinical approach for treatment is based on administration of temozolomide (TMZ) in combination with radiotherapy. Much evidence suggests that the intracellular level of the alkylating enzyme O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) impacts response to TMZ in GBM patients. MGMT expression is regulated by the methylation of its promoter. However, evidence indicates that this is not the only regulatory mechanism present. Here, we describe a hitherto unknown microRNA-mediated mechanism of MGMT expression regulation. We show that miR-221 and miR-222 are upregulated in GMB patients and that these paralogues target MGMT mRNA, inducing greater TMZ-mediated cell death. However, miR-221/miR-222 also increase DNA damage and, thus, chromosomal rearrangements. Indeed, miR-221 overexpression in glioma cells led to an increase in markers of DNA damage, an effect rescued by re-expression of MGMT. Thus, chronic miR-221/222-mediated MGMT downregulation may render cells unable to repair genetic damage. This, associated also to miR-221/222 oncogenic potential, may poor GBM prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W1979433605,"Polynucleotides containing consecutive tracts of guanines can adopt an intramolecular G-quadruplex structure where multiple planar tetrads of hydrogen-bound guanines stack on top of each other. Remodeling of G-quadruplexes impacts numerous aspects of nucleotide biology including transcriptional and translational control. RNA helicase associated with AU-rich element (RHAU), a member of the ATP-dependent DEX(H/D) family of RNA helicases, has been established as a major cellular quadruplex resolvase. RHAU contains a core helicase domain responsible for ATP binding/hydrolysis/helicase activity and is flanked on either side by N- and C-terminal extensions. The N-terminal extension is required for quadruplex recognition, and we have previously demonstrated complex formation between this domain and a quadruplex from human telomerase RNA. Here we used an integrated approach that includes small angle x-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, circular dichroism, and dynamic light scattering methods to demonstrate the recognition of G-quadruplexes by the N-terminal domain of RHAU. Based on our results, we conclude that (i) quadruplex from the human telomerase RNA and its DNA analog both adopt a disc shape in solution, (ii) RHAU53-105 adopts a defined and extended conformation in solution, and (iii) the N-terminal domain mediates an interaction with a guanine tetrad face of quadruplexes. Together, these data form the foundation for understanding the recognition of quadruplexes by the N-terminal domain of RHAU."
https://openalex.org/W2053550225,"Background In the United States, Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV. Latino MSM are a diverse group who differ culturally based on their countries or regions of birth and their time in the United States. We assessed differences in HIV prevalence and testing among Latino MSM by location of birth, time since arrival, and other social determinants of health. Methods For the 2008 National HIV Behavioral Surveillance System, a cross-sectional survey conducted in large US cities, MSM were interviewed and tested for HIV infection. We used generalized estimating equations to test associations between various factors and 1) prevalent HIV infection and 2) being tested for HIV infection in the past 12 months. Results Among 1734 Latino MSM, HIV prevalence was 19%. In multivariable analysis, increasing age, low income, and gay identity were associated with HIV infection. Moreover, men who were U.S.-born or who arrived ≥5 years ago had significantly higher HIV prevalence than recent immigrants. Among men not reporting a previous positive HIV test, 63% had been tested for HIV infection in the past 12 months; recent testing was most strongly associated with having seen a health care provider and disclosing male-male attraction/sexual behavior to a health care provider. Conclusions We identified several social determinants of health associated with HIV infection and testing among Latino MSM. Lower HIV prevalence among recent immigrants contrasts with higher prevalence among established immigrants and suggests a critical window of opportunity for HIV prevention, which should prioritize those with low income, who are at particular risk for HIV infection. Expanding health care utilization and encouraging communication with health care providers about sexual orientation may increase testing."

Aberrant activation of PKC signaling contributes to diabetic cardiomyopathy by mechanisms that are poorly understood. Previous reports indicate that PKC is implicated in alternative splicing regulation. Therefore, we wanted to test whether PKC activation in diabetic hearts induces alternative splicing abnormalities. Here, using RNA sequencing we identified a set of 22 alternative splicing events that undergo a developmental switch in splicing, and we confirmed that splicing reverts to an embryonic pattern in adult diabetic hearts. This network of genes has important functions in RNA metabolism and in developmental processes such as differentiation. Importantly, PKC isozymes α/β control alternative splicing of these genes via phosphorylation and up-regulation of the RNA-binding proteins CELF1 and Rbfox2. Using a mutant of CELF1, we show that phosphorylation of CELF1 by PKC is necessary for regulation of splicing events altered in diabetes. In summary, our studies indicate that activation of PKCα/β in diabetic hearts contributes to the genome-wide splicing changes through phosphorylation and up-regulation of CELF1/Rbfox2 proteins.

It is currently unknown whether these splicing regulators have roles in diabetes pathogenesis. Because PKC is implicated in AS regulation and diabetic cardiomyopathy pathogenesis, we wanted to determine whether PKC signaling contributes to abnormal gene expression in diabetes via alternative splicing. In this study, transcriptome analysis revealed that conserved AS events revert back to an embryonic pattern in adult diabetic hearts. We demonstrate that PKCα/β signaling regulates embryonic to adult splicing transitions of these genes. PKCα/β induces fetal splicing via phosphorylation of the RNA-binding proteins CELF1 and Rbfox2. Notably, a CELF1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by PKC is unable to regulate the splicing event altered in diabetic hearts. Overall, our data indicate that one of the mechanisms for abnormal gene expression in diabetes is due to a shift from an adult to a fetal splicing pattern mediated by PKCα/β. H9c2-2 cells (ATCC CRL-1446) originally isolated from E13 (corresponds to ∼E11 in mouse) BDX1 rat heart ventricles were adapted to cell culture via selective serial passaging (25Kimes B.W. Brandt B.L. Properties of a clonal muscle cell line from rat heart.Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 367-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (ATCC 30-2002), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, ATCC 30-2020), 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen 15140) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Media were changed every 2–3 days, and cells were subcultured at 70–75% confluency. The passage number of the cells used in all experiments was 4–6. Differentiation of H9c2 cells into cardiomyocyte-like cells was induced by adding 1 μm all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) daily to the reduced serum media (1% FBS) for 7 days. H9c2 cells (1 × 106) were plated in a 150-mm dish 1 day before differentiation. Cells were harvested daily or at the end of differentiation for RNA and/or protein extraction. Undifferentiated control cells were mock (DMSO)-treated and harvested after 24 h for RNA and/or protein extraction. In the PKC inhibitor experiments, both undifferentiated and differentiated cells were mock-treated or treated with the 1.0 μm PKC inhibitor BisIX (EMD557529) daily for 7 days. The inhibitor concentration was increased by 0.1 μm each day. Cells were monitored daily by light microscopy to observe morphological changes. Primary rat cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat heart ventricles (Cell Application Inc., R357-25). Cells were maintained in rat cardiomyocyte growth media (Cell Application Inc., R313-500) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator and monitored daily by light microscopy. Media were renewed every 2 days. Cells were trypsinized gently (0.05% trypsin/EDTA, Invitrogen 25300-054) prior to plating. For experiments, 2 × 105 cells were plated on gelatin (Sigma G1890)-coated T25 flasks (Nunc 12-565-351). Seven to 10 days after plating, beating cardiomyocytes were either mock-treated or treated with 2.0 μm of the PKC inhibitor BisIX (EMD557529) for 12 h. The nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionation protocol was modified from Kuyumcu-Martinez et al. (11Kuyumcu-Martinez N.M. Wang G.S. Cooper T.A.

Cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm NaCl, 0.4% Triton X-100) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors and then passed through a 26-gauge needle. Nuclei were separated by centrifugation at 600 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was kept as the cytoplasmic fraction, and nuclei were washed with the hypotonic buffer to remove the cytoplasmic contaminants, followed by centrifugation at 600 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in hypotonic buffer containing 1% SDS, followed by sonication. The protein concentrations of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were determined using BCA protein assay (Sigma B9643). Half of a mouse heart was cut into small pieces followed by homogenization using a glass douncer in 500 μl of cytosolic buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm PMSF, 1 mm DTT, and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Applied Science). The minced heart tissue was dounced six times prior to centrifugation at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction, and the nuclear pellet was washed twice with 1.0 ml of cytosolic buffer and centrifuged at 3000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove cytoplasmic contaminants. Nuclear pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of urea buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 4% CHAPS, 7 m urea, and 2 m thiourea) followed by incubation at 90 °C for 5 min (repeated once more). For two-dimensional gel analysis, the nuclear pellet was sonicated gently on ice instead and loaded on two-dimensional gels as described previously (11Kuyumcu-Martinez N.M. Wang G.S. Cooper T.A.

Cell. 2007; 28: 68-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were estimated using the Bradford protein assay. 30–50 μg of protein/sample was separated on 10% SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore IPVH00010). Membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma P7170) to assess the quality of the transfer and the loading of the proteins. Membranes were blocked with 5% dry fat-free milk solution in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) followed by overnight incubation with the indicated primary antibodies (Abs) at 4 °C. Membranes were washed three times with PBST 15 min each and incubated with HRP-labeled relevant secondary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. HRP activity was determined using Immobilon Western chemiluminescent (Millipore P90720) or SuperSignal West Femto Chemiluminescent (Pierce PI34095) HRP substrate followed by exposure to x-ray film (GeneMate F9024) or Kodak Gel Logic 2200. Percent increase or decrease in protein levels was quantified using the Kodak Gel Logic software after normalizing the protein levels to the appropriate loading controls. Whole rat (Sprague-Dawley) embryo paraffin sections at E13 and E18 stages and sagittal heart sections of newborn and adult rats (Sprague-Dawley) were purchased from Zyagen. Paraffin sections were incubated at 56 °C for 12–14 h, followed by deparaffinization and dehydration in xylene for 20 min. Slides were washed in decreasing concentrations (100 to 50%) of ethanol for 5 min at each concentration. Antigens were exposed by incubating the sections with sodium citrate buffer (10 mm, pH 6.0) for 20 min in a steam chamber. Blocking was performed in 3% BSA in PBST (0.2% Triton X-100) at RT for 1 h. Sections were then incubated with the appropriate primary Abs as follows: anti-PKCα, anti-CELF1, anti-cTNI, or anti-Nkx2.5 for 14–16 h at RT in a humidifying chamber. Slides were washed with PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and then incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary Abs as follows: anti-mouse Alexa Fluor-488 or anti-rabbit Texas Red for 2 h at 37 °C. Slides were washed four times with PBS + 0.1% Triton X-100, followed by 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) stain for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Excess stain was washed away with PBS before mounting the coverslips using Mowiol mounting media; the slides were then sealed using nail polish. Fluorescence images were obtained with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM 510META, Carl Zeiss) at the University of Texas Medical Branch imaging core facility. To quantify the number of cardiomyocytes that display nuclear CELF1 or PKCα staining, IHC images obtained from multiple sections for each developmental stage were used to count DAPI-stained nuclei that display both red (cardiomyocytes markers) and green (CELF1 or PKCα) fluorescence using ImageJ software (nuclei>150) (26Schneider C.A.

Nonobese diabetic (NOD) female mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (NOD/ShiLtJ). For STZ-induced T1D mice, C57BL/6J male mice (8 weeks old) were either injected with citrate buffer as a control or with 60 mg/kg STZ daily for 5 days (27Wu K.K. Huan Y. Streptozotocin-induced diabetic models in mice and rats.Curr. Protoc. Pharmacol. 2008; (Chapter 5, Unit 5.47)Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Blood glucose levels of control, NOD, and STZ mice were determined once a week using blood from the tail vein by a one-touch glucometer. Mice with fasting glucose levels >300 mg/dl for 3, 6, and 9 weeks were used as diabetics, and fasting glucose levels <200 were used as controls. Mice were sacrificed, and their hearts were isolated for protein and RNA extraction. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Texas Medical Branch. RNA was extracted from cells and human and mouse heart tissues using TRIzol (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentrations were measured using EPOCH Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek). Human heart tissues were obtained from the National Disease Research Interchange. Two control human heart tissues were gifts from Dr. Nisha Garg, University of Texas Medical Branch. All human heart tissues used in this study were pre-existing and are exempt from Institute Review Board. Sprague-Dawley rat heart RNA at different developmental stages (E13, E18, E20, newborn, and adult) was purchased from Zyagen. At least four pooled hearts were used for RNA extraction at early developmental stages. PKC phosphorylation sites were identified using LC-MS/MS on human CELF1 protein expressed in 293T cells. The predicted sites of Ser (28, 52, 178, 179, 241, 300, 302) were mutated to Ala and Thr-173 to Val using site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene 200516) to generate the CELF1M8 construct in p3×FLAG vector. The qRT-PCR protocol was adapted from Kalsotra et al. (18Kalsotra A. Xiao X. Ward A.J. Castle J.C. Johnson J.M. Burge C.B. Cooper T.A.

Primer sequences were designed to detect the alternative exons of the following: myotubularin-related protein 3 (Mtmr3); ATPase Ca2+-transporting plasma membrane (Atp2b1); Fragile X mental retardation gene 1 (Fxr1); muscleblind-like 2 (Mbnl2), and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1 (hnRNPH1) (Table 4). PCR was performed using 5 μl of cDNA and 100 ng of each primer pair with Biolase Taq polymerase (Bioline BIO-21042). PCR amplification of all genes was carried out at the following 95 °C, 45 s; 59 °C, 45 s; 72 °C, 1 min for 25 cycles. PCR products were resolved on 5–8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels and stained with ethidium bromide. Bands were quantified for percentage exon inclusion using Kodak Gel Logic 2200 and molecular imaging software as percentage inclusion = ((exon inclusion band)/(exon inclusion band + exon exclusion band)·100) as described previously (18Kalsotra A.

Before library construction, the quality of the RNA was determined using the bioanalyzer. ∼200 m reads per sample were generated. Alternative cassette exon inclusions were determined using the MISO algorithm (29Katz Y. Wang E.T. Airoldi E.M. Burge C.B. Analysis and design of RNA sequencing experiments for identifying isoform regulation.Nat. Methods. 2010; 7: 1009-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Splicing event annotations were downloaded from the MISO webserver that was based on the ENSEMBL gene annotation. H9c2 cells (1.25 × 106) were transfected with different plasmids as follows: 1 μg each, encoding an shRNA against PKCα (OriGene TG704205) or encoding a scrambled shRNA (OriGene TR30015) using the Neon Nucleofection System (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected in DMEM with 10% FBS containing 1.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma P9620) 1 day before differentiation. Cells were maintained in puromycin selection media during 7 days of differentiation. COS M6 cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. 1 μg of FLAG-tagged wild type human CELF1 (CELF1WT) or mutant CELF1 (CELF1M8) plasmid was transfected. Cells were harvested using urea buffer for protein extraction or TRIzol for RNA extraction 48 h post-transfection. To determine whether AS is altered in adult diabetic hearts that could contribute to abnormal gene expression, we performed a genome-wide transcriptome analysis to compare alternative splicing profiles between diabetic and control mice. For this analysis, we used a well established type 1 diabetes mouse model that develops diabetes and eventually diabetic cardiomyopathy after injection of STZ that kills pancreatic beta islet cells (5Boudina S.

https://openalex.org/W2042758501,"Over 85% of all chemical industry products are made using catalysts, with the overwhelming majority of these employing heterogeneous catalysts functioning at the gas-solid interface. Consequently, optimizing catalytic reactor design attracts much effort. Such optimization relies on heat transfer and fluid dynamics modeling coupled to surface reaction kinetics. The complexity of these systems demands many approximations, which can only be tested with experimental observations of quantities such as temperature, pressure, concentrations, flow rates, etc. One essential measurement is a map of the spatial variation in temperature throughout the catalyst bed. We present here the first non-invasive maps of gas temperatures in catalyst-filled reactors, including high spatial resolution maps in microreactors enabled by parahydrogen. The thermal maps reveal energy flux patterns whose length scale correlates with the catalyst packing. By exploiting the motional averaging under a weak applied magnetic-field gradient, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) linewidths are inversely proportional to temperature. Measurements during the hydrogenation of propylene in reactors packed with metal nanoparticles and metal-organic framework catalysts yield temperature coefficients of ~0.1 Hz/K, and temperature error <4%. Temperature sensitivity increases with gradient strength, enabling tuning of precision."

We have shown recently that direct interaction between BUBR1 and MAD2 is critical for assembly and function of the human mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), the SAC effector. Here we report that inhibition of MPS1 kinase activity by reversine disrupts BUBR1-MAD2 as well as CDC20-MAD2 interactions, causing premature activation of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome. The effect of MPS1 inhibition is likely due to reduction of closed MAD2 (C-MAD2), as expressing a MAD2 mutant (MAD2L13A) that is locked in the C conformation rescued the checkpoint defects. In the presence of reversine, exogenous C-MAD2 does not localize to unattached kinetochores but is still incorporated into the MCC. Contrary to a previous report, we found that sustained MPS1 activity is required for maintaining both the MAD1·C-MAD2 complex and open MAD2 (O-MAD2) at unattached kinetochores to facilitate C-MAD2 production. Additionally, mitotic phosphorylation of BUBR1 is also affected by MPS1 inhibition but seems dispensable for MCC assembly.

In studying how the BUBR1-MAD2 interaction is regulated, we found that the interaction is impaired when MPS1 kinase activity is inhibited. Importantly, the impairment can be rescued by expressing a C-MAD2 mutant in mitotic cells, supporting that MPS1 contributes to SAC signal transduction mainly through regulating C-MAD2 production. HeLaM, a subline of HeLa, was maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2 (9Tipton A.R. Tipton M. Yen T. Liu S.T. Closed MAD2 (C-MAD2) is selectively incorporated into the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC).Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 3740-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). To block cells in prometaphase, HeLaM cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h and then directly released into medium containing 0.2 μm nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) or 10 μm taxol (Biomol International) for 12 h. Alternatively, to treat cells with reversine prior to mitotic entry, cells arrested in G1/S by double thymidine block were released into drug-free medium for 5 h and then treated with nocodazole or taxol in combination with reversine or DMSO for 3 h followed by MG132 addition for another 1.5 h. Some variations of cell synchronization protocols are described in more detail in the figure legends. Reversine (Calbiochem) was used at 500 nm (29Santaguida S. Tighe A. D'Alise A.M. Taylor S.S.

The BUBR1 mutants were subcloned into a mammalian GST fusion vector. GST-BUBR15A was used as a template to create a BUBR111A (adding T54A, S435A, S676A, T792A, T1008A, and T1042A on the basis of known in vivo phosphorylation sites in PubMed Central). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange multisite kit from Stratagene. All mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Other DNA constructs have been described previously (15Tipton A.R. Wang K. Link L. Bellizzi J.J. Huang H. Yen T. Liu S.T.

DNA transfection was carried out using TransIT-LT1 reagent (Mirus) following the instructions of the manufacturer. The extracts were prepared and assayed as described previously (15Tipton A.R.

In vitro ubiquitylation assays were performed essentially as described previously (9Tipton A.R. Tipton M. Yen T. Liu S.T.

Usually, 4 μl of bead slurry was used in a ubiquitylation reaction. For imaging at a lower magnification (Fig. 3), HeLaM cells grown in 24-well plates were synchronized by double thymidine block and transfected with GFP- or mCherry-tagged MAD2WT, MAD2L13A, or MAD2ΔC10 at the beginning of the second thymidine block. Cells were released 16 h later directly into nocodazole-containing phenol red-free DMEM and allowed to grow for an additional 12 h. HEPES-KOH (pH7.6) and OxyFluor (Oxyrase) were added to 25 mm and 0.3 units/ml, respectively. Then, cells were covered with mineral oil. DMSO or reversine were added to the medium immediately before imaging. Phase-contrast and GFP or mCherry images (using Alexa Fluor 488 or 555 channels) were collected on an automated Olympus IX-81 microscope using a 20 ×, NA 0.50 UPlanFLN objective while cells were maintained at 37 °C in a heated chamber. Single-plane images were acquired for 14 h at 6-min intervals at multiple positions using a CoolSNAP HQ2 camera with 2 × 2 binning. For imaging at a higher magnification (Fig. 4), HeLaM cells stably expressing mRFP-H2A were grown on No. 1.5 coverslip-bottomed, 35-mm dishes (MatTek); transiently transfected with GFP-MAD2L13A, MAD2ΔC10, or other GFP fusion constructs; and imaged on a Leica TCS SP8 confocal microscope using a 63 ×, NA1.40 objective, usually 24 h after transfection. Z-stacks of 1 μm were collected at each time point with 3-min intervals. When needed, drugs were dissolved in ∼1/5 volume of the medium and added underneath the mineral oil. We have demonstrated previously that BUBR1-MAD2 interaction is crucial for MCC assembly and MCC inhibition toward the APC/C (9Tipton A.R. Tipton M. Yen T. Liu S.T. Closed MAD2 (C-MAD2) is selectively incorporated into the mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC).Cell Cycle. 2011; 10: 3740-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 15Tipton A.R. Wang K. Link L.

Chem. 2011; 286: 21173-21179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To investigate the potential roles of MPS1 in regulating the BUBR1-MAD2 interaction and MCC assembly, mitotic cells arrested with nocodazole or taxol were treated with the MPS1 inhibitors reversine or AZ3146 (22Hewitt L. Tighe A. Santaguida S. White A.M. Jones C.D. Musacchio A. Green S. Taylor S.S. Sustained Mps1 activity is required in mitosis to recruit O-Mad2 to the Mad1-C-Mad2 core complex.J.

Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1). Inhibition of MPS1 by reversine treatment dramatically reduced MAD2 levels associated with BUBR1 in both nocodazole- and taxol-arrested cells (Fig. 1A, see supplemental Fig. S1, B–D for taxol results). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation using two distinct anti-MAD2 antibodies not only confirmed the inability of MAD2 to associate with BUBR1 but also revealed disruption of the MAD2-CDC20 interaction in reversine-treated cells (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1, the reproducibly less clear BUB3 signals may be related to MAD2 antibodies). In contrast, the BUBR1-CDC20 interaction showed no apparent changes after reversine treatment (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1C). Similar results were obtained by treating cells with AZ3146 (supplemental Fig. S1E) or by adding reversine prior to mitotic entry (supplemental Fig. S2). In addition, the level of MAD2 coimmunoprecipitated with BUBR1 was also reduced when MPS1 was silenced by either shRNA or siRNA (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1F). Furthermore, rescue experiments indicated that wild-type but not kinase-dead MPS1 could restore the level of MAD2 in BUBR1 IP to be comparable with that in control mitotic cells (Fig. 1B). The combined results demonstrate that MPS1 kinase activity is essential for incorporating MAD2 into the MCC. To correlate defective MCC assembly with SAC override and mitotic exit caused by reversine treatment (29Santaguida S. Tighe A. D'Alise A.M. Taylor S.S. Musacchio A. Dissecting the role of MPS1 in chromosome biorientation and the spindle checkpoint through the small molecule inhibitor reversine.J. Cell Biol. 2010; 190: 73-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), we examined both APC/C activity and APC/C-MCC association in nocodazole and MG132 arrested mitotic cells (Fig. 2). APC/C activity, measured by percentage of ubiquitylated myc-cyclin B(1–102) after incubation, was higher when the APC/C was isolated from reversine-treated mitotic cells than from DMSO-treated (control) cells (Fig. 2A). Consistently, reduced levels of BUBR1, BUB3, and MAD2 were found to coimmunoprecipitate with APC4 (an APC/C core subunit) following reversine treatment, suggesting loss of MCC association with the APC/C (Fig. 2B). Association of the activator protein CDC20 with APC4 was not altered (Fig. 2B). The results provide molecular evidence to link reversine-mediated mitotic exit with premature APC/C activation. We then performed inhibitor washout experiments to confirm that MPS1 kinase regulates MCC assembly (Fig. 2, C and D). Incorporation of MAD2 into the MCC, as evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation of MAD2 with BUBR1, was rapidly restored following reversine washout (within 15 min) (Fig. 2C, BUBR1 IP, 15–45 min lanes). No distinctive changes in BUBR1-CDC20 interaction was observed throughout the course of the experiment. Coinciding with MAD2 loss from the MCC, only APC/C isolated from the 0 min time point displayed ubiquitylation activity (Fig. 2D, lane 2). As MAD2 reassociated with BUBR1, APC/C isolated 15–45 min after reversine washout exhibited no ubiquitylation activity (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 3–5 to lane 2). The above results could also be recapitulated when cells were arrested in taxol (supplemental Fig. S3). The results underscore the importance of MAD2 incorporation into the MCC for efficient APC/C inhibition. As MPS1 inhibition causes dissociation of MAD2 from both BUBR1 and CDC20, and BUBR1 and CDC20 bind only to C-MAD2 (15Tipton A.R. Wang K. Link L. Bellizzi J.J. Huang H. Yen T. Liu S.T.

The Mad2 spindle checkpoint protein undergoes similar major conformational changes upon binding to either Mad1 or Cdc20.Mol.

This idea is consistent with the roles of MPS1 in recruiting MAD1·C-MAD2 to kinetochores and O-MAD2 to the MAD1·C-MAD2 complex (19Martin-Lluesma S. Stucke V.M. Nigg E.A.

To test the idea in a more direct manner, time-lapse live cell imaging was employed to examine whether reversine-compromised SAC could be rescued by expression of a C conformation-locked MAD2 mutant, MAD2L13A (35Yang M.

We aimed at estimating the prevalence of prescription of relevant potentially interacting drugs and at evaluating possible predictors of potentially interacting drug exposure. We retrospectively analyzed data on prescriptions dispensed from January 2004 to August 2005 to individuals of two Italian regions with a population of almost 2.1 million individuals. We identified 27 pairs of potentially interacting drugs by examining clinical relevance, documentation, and volume of use in Italy. Subjects who received at least one prescription of both drugs were selected. Co-prescribing denotes ""two prescriptions in the same day"", and concomitant medication ""the prescription of two drugs with overlapping coverage"". A logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the predictors of potential Drug-Drug Interaction (pDDIs). 957,553 subjects (45.3% of study population) were exposed to at least one of the drugs/classes of the 27 pairs. Overall, pDDIs occurred 2,465,819 times. The highest rates of concomitant prescription and of co-prescription were for ACE inhibitors+NSAIDs (6,253 and 4,621/100,000 plan participants). Considering concomitance, the male/female ratio was <1 in 17/27 pairs (from 0.31 for NSAIDs-ASA+SSRI to 0.74 for omeprazole+clopidogrel). The mean age was lowest for methotrexate pairs (+omeprazole, 59.9 years; +NSAIDs-ASA, 59.1 years) and highest for digoxin+verapamil (75.4 years). In 13/27 pairs, the mean ages were ≥70 years. On average, subjects involved in pDDIs received ≥10 drugs. The odds of exposure were more frequently higher for age ≥65 years, males, and those taking a large number of drugs. A substantial number of clinically important pDDIs were observed, particularly among warfarin users. Awareness of the most prevalent pDDIs could help practitioners in preventing concomitant use, resulting in a better quality of drug prescription and potentially avoiding unwanted side effects."
https://openalex.org/W1982999071,"Ezrin, a member of the ezrin-radixin-moesin family (ERM), is an essential regulator of the structure of microvilli on the apical aspect of epithelial cells. Ezrin provides a linkage between membrane-associated proteins and F-actin, oscillating between active/open and inactive/closed states, and is regulated in part by phosphorylation of a C-terminal threonine. In the open state, ezrin can bind a number of ligands, but in the closed state the ligand-binding sites are inaccessible. In vitro analysis has proposed that there may be a third hyperactivated form of ezrin. To gain a better understanding of ezrin, we conducted an unbiased proteomic analysis of ezrin-binding proteins in an epithelial cell line, Jeg-3. We refined our list of interactors by comparing the interactomes using quantitative mass spectrometry between wild-type ezrin, closed ezrin, open ezrin, and hyperactivated ezrin. The analysis reveals several novel interactors confirmed by their localization to microvilli, as well as a significant class of proteins that bind closed ezrin. Taken together, the data indicate that ezrin can exist in three different conformational states, and different ligands ""perceive"" ezrin conformational states differently."
https://openalex.org/W2021153403,"Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) independently increases the risk of death and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the general population. However, the relationship between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and CVD/death risk in a general population at low risk of CVD has not been explored so far. Design Baseline and longitudinal data of 1465 men and 1459 women aged 35-74 years participating to the MATISS study, an Italian general population cohort, were used to evaluate the role of eGFR in the prediction of all-cause mortality and incident CVD. Methods Bio-bank stored sera were used to evaluate eGFR at baseline. Serum creatinine was measured on thawed samples by means of an IDMS-calibrated enzymatic method. eGFR was calculated by the CKD-EPI formula. Results At baseline, less than 2% of enrolled persons had eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2 and more than 70% had a 10-year cardiovascular risk score < 10%. In people 60 or more years old, the first and the last eGFR quintiles (<90 and ≥109 mL/min/1.73m2, respectively) were associated to an increased risk for both all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.6, 95% confidence interval 1.2-2.1 and 4.3, 1.6-11.7, respectively) and incident CVD (1.6, 1.0-2.4 and 7.0, 2.2-22.9, respectively), even if adjusted for classical risk factors. Conclusions These findings strongly suggest that in an elderly, general population at low risk of CVD and low prevalence of reduced renal filtration, even a modest eGFR reduction is related to all-cause mortality and CVD incidence, underlying the potential benefit to this population of considering eGFR for their risk prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2062031166,"Satellite cell self-renewal is an essential process to maintaining the robustness of skeletal muscle regenerative capacity. However, extrinsic factors that regulate self-renewal of satellite cells are not well understood. Here, we demonstrate that TWEAK cytokine reduces the proportion of Pax7(+)/MyoD(-) cells (an index of self-renewal) on myofiber explants and represses multiple components of Notch signaling in satellite cell cultures. The number of Pax7(+) cells is significantly increased in skeletal muscle of TWEAK knock-out (KO) mice compared with wild-type in response to injury. Furthermore, Notch signaling is significantly elevated in cultured satellite cells and in regenerating myofibers of TWEAK-KO mice. Forced activation of Notch signaling through overexpression of the Notch1 intracellular domain (N1ICD) rescued the TWEAK-mediated inhibition of satellite cell self-renewal. TWEAK also activates the NF-κB transcription factor in satellite cells and inhibition of NF-κB significantly improved the number of Pax7(+) cells in TWEAK-treated cultures. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that a reciprocal interaction between NF-κB and Notch signaling governs the inhibitory effect of TWEAK on satellite cell self-renewal. Collectively, our study demonstrates that TWEAK suppresses satellite cell self-renewal through activating NF-κB and repressing Notch signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2056553135,"The vestibular system detects motion of the head in space and in turn generates reflexes that are vital for our daily activities. The eye movements produced by the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) play an essential role in stabilizing the visual axis (gaze), while vestibulo-spinal reflexes ensure the maintenance of head and body posture. The neuronal pathways from the vestibular periphery to the cervical spinal cord potentially serve a dual role, since they function to stabilize the head relative to inertial space and could thus contribute to gaze (eye-in-head + head-in-space) and posture stabilization. To date, however, the functional significance of vestibular-neck pathways in alert primates remains a matter of debate. Here we used a vestibular prosthesis to 1) quantify vestibularly-driven head movements in primates, and 2) assess whether these evoked head movements make a significant contribution to gaze as well as postural stabilization. We stimulated electrodes implanted in the horizontal semicircular canal of alert rhesus monkeys, and measured the head and eye movements evoked during a 100ms time period for which the contribution of longer latency voluntary inputs to the neck would be minimal. Our results show that prosthetic stimulation evoked significant head movements with latencies consistent with known vestibulo-spinal pathways. Furthermore, while the evoked head movements were substantially smaller than the coincidently evoked eye movements, they made a significant contribution to gaze stabilization, complementing the VOR to ensure that the appropriate gaze response is achieved. We speculate that analogous compensatory head movements will be evoked when implanted prosthetic devices are transitioned to human patients."
https://openalex.org/W1999761856,"Sleep apnea has been recognized as a factor predisposing to atrial fibrillation recurrence and progression. The effect of other sleep-disturbing conditions on atrial fibrillation progression is not known. We sought to determine whether frequent periodic leg movement during sleep is a risk factor for progression of atrial fibrillation. In this retrospective study, patients with atrial fibrillation and a clinical suspicion of restless legs syndrome who were referred for polysomnography were divided into two groups based on severity of periodic leg movement during sleep: frequent (periodic movement index >35/h) and infrequent (≤35/h). Progression of atrial fibrillation to persistent or permanent forms between the two groups was compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test, chi-square tests and logistic regression analysis. Of 373 patients with atrial fibrillation (77% paroxysmal, 23% persistent), 108 (29%) progressed to persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation during follow-up (median, 33 months; interquartile range, 16-50). Compared to patients with infrequent periodic leg movement during sleep (n=168), patients with frequent periodic leg movement during sleep (n=205) had a higher rate of atrial fibrillation progression (23% vs. 34%; p=0.01). Patients with frequent periodic leg movement during sleep were older and predominantly male; however, there were no significant differences at baseline in clinical factors that promote atrial fibrillation progression between both groups. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of atrial fibrillation progression were persistent atrial fibrillation at baseline, female gender, hypertension and frequent periodic leg movement during sleep. In patients with frequent periodic leg movement during sleep, dopaminergic therapy for control of leg movements in patients with restless legs syndrome reduced risk of atrial fibrillation progression. Frequent leg movement during sleep in patients with restless legs syndrome is associated with progression of atrial fibrillation to persistent and permanent forms."

In prokaryotic cells, SRP consists of a SRP54 protein (Ffh in bacteria) and a 4.5S SRP RNA (Fig. 1A, SRP). Ffh contains a methionine-rich M domain, which binds the SRP RNA and the signal sequence on the translating ribosome. In addition, an NG domain in Ffh, comprising a GTPase G domain and a four-helix bundle N domain, forms a tight complex with a highly homologous NG domain in the SRP receptor (called FtsY in bacteria) in the presence of GTP (9Egea P.F.

In addition to the SRP and SRP receptor GTPases, the SRP RNA is the only other universally conserved and essential component of the cytosolic SRP system (Fig. 1B). Extensive previous work showed that the SRP RNA provides an active scaffold that regulates protein-protein interactions and protein conformational rearrangements during the targeting reaction. The bacterial 4.5S SRP RNA adopts a hairpin structure containing five internal loops, capped by a highly conserved GGAA tetraloop (Fig. 1B). Two internal loops, A and B, mediate binding of the SRP RNA to the Ffh M domain with picomolar affinity (22Batey R.T. Rambo R.P. Lucast L. Rha B. Doudna J.A.

Synergistic actions between the SRP RNA and translating ribosome allow efficient delivery of the correct cargos during cotranslational protein targeting.RNA. 2011; 17: 892-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently, crystallographic and single molecule analyses showed that GTPase activation requires the Ffh-FtsY GTPase complex to interact with a distal docking site at the 5′,3′-distal end of the SRP RNA (Fig. 1B) (27Ataide S.F. Schmitz N. Shen K. Ke A. Shan S.O. Doudna J.A. Ban N. The crystal structure of the signal recognition particle in complex with its receptor.Science. 2011; 331: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Shen K. Arslan S. Akopian D. Ha T. Shan S.O. Activated GTPase movement on an RNA scaffold drives co-translational protein targeting.Nature. 2012; 492: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Together with biochemical studies, these data demonstrate a global relocalization of the Ffh-FtsY GTPase complex, from the tetraloop end of the SRP RNA during initial complex assembly to the distal end where the GTPase complex hydrolyzes GTP (Fig. 1A, step 3). The global rearrangement along the SRP RNA is important for multiple reasons. First, it provides temporal regulation of GTP hydrolysis. On the one hand, rapid GTP hydrolysis is desired at the end of the SRP cycle to regenerate free SRP. On the other hand, GTP hydrolysis should be delayed to minimize premature complex disassembly before the RNC is productively delivered to the SecYEG translocation machinery. The spatial separation of the sites on the SRP RNA that mediate GTPase assembly and activation resolves this dilemma: the Ffh-FtsY GTPase complex only migrates to the distal end of the RNA and hydrolyzes GTP at the end of the SRP cycle, after encounter with the SecYEG machinery (17Akopian D.

Activated GTPase movement on an RNA scaffold drives co-translational protein targeting.Nature. 2012; 492: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Second, the global rearrangement of SRP enables coordinated handover of RNC from targeting to the translocation machinery. In the RNC-SRP complex, Ffh binds the L23 protein on the large ribosomal subunit (5Halic M. Blau M. Becker T. Mielke T. Pool M.R. Wild K. Sinning I. Beckmann R.

Structure of the E. coli signal recognition particle bound to a translating ribosome.Nature. 2006; 444: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Strikingly, the same site is used by SecYEG to interact with the ribosome (Fig. 1A) (29Becker T. Bhushan S. Jarasch A. Armache J.P. Funes S. Jossinet F. Gumbart J. Mielke T. Berninghausen O.

Structure of the E. coli protein-conducting channel bound to a translating ribosome.Nature. 2005; 438: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Relocalizing the GTPase complex to the distal end of the SRP RNA ensures the productive exchange of the targeting and translocation machineries at the L23 binding site and thus efficient co-translational protein targeting. Despite the biological importance of the GTPase relocalization on the SRP RNA, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. First, how the Ffh-FtsY GTPase complex interacts specifically with the distal docking site remains obscure, especially given the low degree of sequence conservation at the distal docking site and the predominantly electrostatic nature of the GTPase interactions with this site observed in the crystal structure (27Ataide S.F. Schmitz N. Shen K. Ke A. Shan S.O. Doudna J.A. Ban N. The crystal structure of the signal recognition particle in complex with its receptor.Science. 2011; 331: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Indeed, nonspecific docking of the Ffh-FtsY GTPase complex on the SRP RNA has been observed in single molecule experiments that represent “trial-and-error” searches of the complex for the correct docking site (28Shen K. Arslan S. Akopian D. Ha T. Shan S.O. Activated GTPase movement on an RNA scaffold drives co-translational protein targeting.Nature. 2012; 492: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the information that specifies the correct distal docking site. Second, different crystal structures suggest two different bases, G83 and C86, as potential catalytic moieties that could insert into the GTPase active site (27Ataide S.F. Schmitz N. Shen K. Ke A. Shan S.O. Doudna J.A. Ban N. The crystal structure of the signal recognition particle in complex with its receptor.Science. 2011; 331: 881-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 48Voigts-Hoffmann F. Schmitz N. Shen K.

Cell. 2013; 10.1016/j.molcel.2013.10.005Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Third, it is unclear whether activation of GTP hydrolysis is coupled to, or independent of, the GTPase relocalization on the SRP RNA. In this work, we utilized biochemical, single molecule, and NMR tools to investigate the molecular mechanism of GTPase docking and activation at the SRP RNA distal end. We show that two docking sites mediate the interaction of the Ffh-FtsY GTPase complex with the RNA distal end. A highly conserved internal loop controls the correct orientation and positioning of these two sites and plays crucial roles in generating a preformed surface for stable docking of the GTPase complex. This docking event can be uncoupled from subsequent GTPase activation, which is mediated by conserved bases in the next internal loop. These results, combined with recent structural work, elucidate how the SRP RNA induces GTPase relocalization and activation at the end of the protein targeting reaction. Plasmids for in vivo expression of Ffh, full-length FtsY, and SRP RNA have been described in previous studies (15Peluso P. Shan S.O. Nock S. Herschlag D. Walter P. Role of SRP RNA in the GTPase cycles of Ffh and FtsY.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15224-15233Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Plasmids for SRP RNA mutants were constructed using the QuikChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's instructions. The plasmid for in vitro transcription of Hammerhead-SRP RNA-HDV was a gift from Adrian Ferre-D'Amare. The hammerhead ribozyme was cleaved from the 5′-end of the RNA sequence during in vitro transcription, and the SRP RNA was extended with an overhang sequence to fuse with the DNA splint handle for single molecule experiments (28Shen K. Arslan S. Akopian D. Ha T. Shan S.O. Activated GTPase movement on an RNA scaffold drives co-translational protein targeting.Nature. 2012; 492: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ffh, FtsY, and SRP RNA were expressed in vivo as described in previous studies. SRP RNAs for smFRET experiments (smRNA) were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase based on the Megascript protocol (Ambion) (28Shen K. Arslan S. Akopian D. Ha T. Shan S.O. Activated GTPase movement on an RNA scaffold drives co-translational protein targeting.Nature. 2012; 492: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Single cysteine mutants of Ffh-C153 were labeled with Cy3-maleimide (GE Healthcare) using a protocol similar to that of previous studies (28Shen K. Arslan S. Akopian D. Ha T. Shan S.O. Activated GTPase movement on an RNA scaffold drives co-translational protein targeting.Nature. 2012; 492: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The labeling reaction was carried out with a 1:5 protein:dye molar ratio at room temperature for 2 h. Unconjugated dyes were removed by gel filtration chromatography using Sephadex G-25 resin (Sigma). A home-built objective-type total internal reflection fluorescence microscope was used to carry out all the single molecule experiment. Green (532-nm) and red (635-nm) lasers were introduced in a 100× oil immersed objective and focused on the coverslip where SRP was immobilized. Scattering light was removed by a 560-nm and a 660-nm long pass filter (Chroma) for the green and red lasers, respectively. Cy3 and Quasar670 signals were split by a DV2 Dualview (Photometrics) and focused onto the Ixon 897 camera (Andor). Data were recorded at 30-ms time resolution. All protein samples were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 rpm (Optima TLX; Beckman Coulter) for 1 h immediately before use to remove aggregates during freeze-thaw cycle. PEGylated slides and coverslips were assembled to a flowing chamber (31Joo C. Balci H. Ishitsuka Y. Buranachai C. Ha T. Advances in single-molecule fluorescence methods for molecular biology.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 51-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Neutravidin was applied to the chamber and incubated for 10 min before flowing in fluorescent molecules of interest. SRP complexes were assembled in SRP buffer (50 mm K-HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm KOAc, 2 mm Mg(OAc)2, 2 mm DTT) supplemented with 0.01% Nikkol. The samples were diluted to a final concentration of 50 pm in imaging buffer (SRP buffer supplemented with 0.4% glucose and 1% Gloxy in Trolox), flowed into the sample chamber, and incubated for 5 min before imaging. Movies were recorded at 30-ms intervals until most fluorescent molecules were photobleached. Data were analyzed by home-written scripts in IDL and Matlab. Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM) of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) trajectory and binning of FRET efficiencies were described previously (32McKinney S.A. Joo C. Ha T.

GTPase rate constants were determined as described previously (15Peluso P. Shan S.O. Nock S. Herschlag D. Walter P. Role of SRP RNA in the GTPase cycles of Ffh and FtsY.Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15224-15233Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In general, reactions contained 100 nm Ffh and 200 nm SRP RNA (wild type or mutants), and varying concentrations of FtsY were incubated with 100 μm GTP (doped with [γ-32P]GTP). Reactions were quenched by 0.75 m KH2PO4, pH 3.3, at different time points, separated by thin layer chromatography (TLC), and quantified by autoradiography. Unlabeled, uniformly 13C,15N-labeled WT, E−1, and E+1 samples, and base-specifically G/C-13C,15N-labeled WTx, E−1x, and E+1x samples were prepared by in vitro transcription using T7 polymerase (P266L mutant) (33Guillerez J. Lopez P.J. Proux F. Launay H. Dreyfus M. A mutation in T7 RNA polymerase that facilitates promoter clearance.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Assignment methodology for larger RNA oligonucleotides: application to an ATP-binding RNA aptamer.J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). After in vitro transcription, the RNA samples were ethanol-precipitated, purified using 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, electroeluted with Elutrap system (Whatman), and purified by anion exchange with a 5-ml Hi-Trap Q column (GE Healthcare). All RNA samples were then desalted and exchanged into water using an Amicon filtration system with 3000 molecular weight cut-off membranes (Millipore). The RNA samples were diluted with water to concentrations of ∼10 μm, heated at 95 °C for 3 min, and snap-cooled on ice for 30 min. All of the WT, E−1, E+1, WTx, E−1x, and E+1x samples were then exchanged into 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.3, 50 mm KCl, and 50 μm EDTA and concentrated to ∼1 mm using an Amicon filtration system. For H2O samples, 10% D2O was added. For D2O samples, the RNA solutions were repeatedly lyophilized and redissolved in the same volume of 99.996% D2O (Sigma). All NMR experiments were carried out on Bruker Avance 800 MHz spectrometers equipped with 5-mm triple resonance cryogenic probes. Exchangeable proton NOESY spectra were recorded using H2O samples at 283K with a 200-ms mixing time, and nonexchangeable proton NOESY spectra were recorded on D2O samples at 298K with a 200-ms mixing time. NMR spectra were processed and analyzed with XWINNMR 3.5 (Bruker), NMRPipe (35Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A.

NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11549) Google Scholar), and Sparky 3.110 (University of California, San Francisco, CA). The assignments were obtained using two-dimensional NOESY, two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy, 1H-15N HSQC, 1H-13C HSQC experiments on the unlabeled and uniformly 13C,15N-labeled RNA samples (WT, E+1, and E−1) (34Dieckmann T.

The secondary structure was determined by analyzing the two-dimensional H2O NOESY, two-dimensional D2O NOESY, and 1H-15N HSQC. Imino proton resonances were assigned from sequential connectivities in H2O NOESY spectra. For analysis of nucleotide dynamics on the pico- to nanosecond time scale, the resonance intensities in 1H-13C HSQC spectra of each type of C-H spin (C1′H1′, C5H5, C6H6, and C8H8) were normalized against the lowest intensity from the helix to the reference value of 0.1 (see Fig. 14). To obtain information on interhelical orientation and relative motion between the distal docking and ED stems, C-H (C1′H1′, C5H5, C6H6, and C8H8) and N-H (imino) residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were measured on base-specifically GC-13C,15N-labeled WTx, E−1x, and E+1x samples in the presence and absence of ∼6 mg/ml Pf1 phage (ASLA Biotech, Ltd.) at 298K on a 800-MHz spectrometer (supplemental Table S1). One-bond C-H RDCs were measured from the splittings of 1H-13C doublets along the 1H dimension using the transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy (TROSY)-based two-dimensional 1H-13C S3CT-HSQC (37Meissner A. Sørensen O.W. The role of coherence transfer efficiency in design of TROSY-type multidimensional NMR experiments.J. Magn. Reson. 1999; 139: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), and one-bond H-N RDCs were determined by using standard 1H-15N HSQC experiments without decoupling in the indirect or direct dimension (38Zhang Q.

https://openalex.org/W1990217267,"Ixodes scapularis is the specific arthropod vector for a number of globally prevalent infections, including Lyme disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. A feeding-induced and acellular epithelial barrier, known as the peritrophic membrane (PM) is detectable in I. scapularis. However, whether or how the PM influences the persistence of major tick-borne pathogens, such as B. burgdorferi, remains largely unknown. Mass spectrometry-based proteome analyses of isolated PM from fed ticks revealed that the membrane contains a few detectable proteins, including a predominant and immunogenic 60 kDa protein with homology to arthropod chitin deacetylase (CDA), herein termed I. scapularis CDA-like protein or IsCDA. Although IsCDA is primarily expressed in the gut and induced early during tick feeding, its silencing via RNA interference failed to influence either the occurrence of the PM or spirochete persistence, suggesting a redundant role of IsCDA in tick biology and host-pathogen interaction. However, treatment of ticks with antibodies against IsCDA, one of the most predominant protein components of PM, affected B. burgdorferi survival, significantly augmenting pathogen levels within ticks but without influencing the levels of total gut bacteria. These studies suggested a preferential role of tick PM in limiting persistence of B. burgdorferi within the vector. Further understanding of the mechanisms by which vector components contribute to pathogen survival may help the development of new strategies to interfere with the infection."

However, the location and identity of Aldh1-expressing cells in zebrafish pancreas remain unknown. In this study we demonstrate that Aldh1-expressing cells are located immediately adjacent to 2F11-positive pancreatic ductal epithelial cells, and that their abundance dramatically increases during zebrafish secondary islet formation. These cells also express neurod, a marker of endocrine progenitor cells, but do not express markers of more mature endocrine cells such as pax6b or insulin. Using formal cre/lox-based lineage tracing, we further show that Aldh1-expressing pancreatic epithelial cells are the direct progeny of pancreatic notch-responsive progenitor cells, identifying them as a critical intermediate between multi-lineage progenitors and mature endocrine cells. Pharmacologic manipulation of Aldh1 enzymatic activity accelerates cell entry into the Aldh1-expressing endocrine progenitor pool, and also leads to the premature maturation of these cells, as evidenced by accelerated pax6b expression. Together, these findings suggest that Aldh1-expressing cells act as both participants and regulators of endocrine differentiation during zebrafish secondary islet formation."
https://openalex.org/W2033280195,"Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of producing fatty-acid-derived hydrocarbons in Escherichia coli. However, product titers and yields remain low. In this work, we demonstrate new methods for improving fatty acid production by modifying central carbon metabolism and storing fatty acids in triacylglycerol. Based on suggestions from a computational model, we deleted seven genes involved in aerobic respiration, mixed-acid fermentation, and glyoxylate bypass (in the order of cyoA, nuoA, ndh, adhE, dld, pta, and iclR) to modify the central carbon metabolic/regulatory networks. These gene deletions led to increased total fatty acids, which were the highest in the mutants containing five or six gene knockouts. Additionally, when two key enzymes in the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway were over-expressed, we observed further increase in strain △cyoA△adhE△nuoA△ndh△pta△dld, leading to 202 mg/g dry cell weight of total fatty acids, ~250% of that in the wild-type strain. Meanwhile, we successfully introduced a triacylglycerol biosynthesis pathway into E. coli through heterologous expression of wax ester synthase/acyl-coenzyme:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (WS/DGAT) enzymes. The added pathway improved both the amount and fuel quality of the fatty acids. These new metabolic engineering strategies are providing promising directions for future investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2016500876,"Background The secondary attack rate of hepatitis A virus (HAV) among contacts of cases is up to 50%. Historically, contacts were offered immunoglobulin (IG, a human derived blood product) as post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). Amid safety concerns about IG, HAV vaccine is increasingly recommended instead. Public health authorities’ recommendations differ, particularly for healthy contacts ≥40 years old, where vaccine efficacy data is limited. We evaluated routine use of HAV vaccine as an alternative to immunoglobulin in PEP, in those considered at low risk of severe infection in the Netherlands. Methods Household contacts of acute HAV cases notified in Amsterdam (2004-2012) were invited ≤14 days post-exposure, for baseline anti-HAV testing and PEP according to national guidelines: immunoglobulin if at risk of severe infection, or hepatitis A vaccine if healthy and at low risk (aged <30, or, 30-50 years and vaccinated <8 days post-exposure). Incidence of laboratory confirmed secondary infection in susceptible contacts was assessed 4-8 weeks post-exposure. In a vaccinated subgroup, relative risk (RR) of secondary infection with estimated using Poisson regression. Results Of 547 contacts identified, 191 were susceptible to HAV. Per-protocol, 167 (87%) were vaccinated (mean:6.7 days post-exposure, standard deviation(sd)=3.3) and 24 (13%) were given immunoglobulin (mean:9.7 days post-exposure, sd=2.8). At follow-up testing, 8/112 (7%) had a laboratory confirmed infection of whom 7 were symptomatic. All secondary infections occurred in vaccinated contacts, and half were >40 years of age. In healthy contacts vaccinated per-protocol ≤8 days post-exposure, RRref. ≤15 years of secondary infection in those >40 years was 12.0 (95%CI:1.3-106.7). Conclusions Timely administration of HAV vaccine in PEP was feasible and the secondary attack rate was low in those <40 years. Internationally, upper age-limits for post-exposure vaccination vary. Pending larger studies, immunoglobulin should be considered PEP of choice in people >40 years of age and those vulnerable to severe disease."
https://openalex.org/W2070701242,"The effect of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) Val158Met polymorphism on brain structure and function has been previously investigated separately and regionally; this prevents us from obtaining a full picture of the effect of this gene variant. Additionally, gender difference must not be overlooked because estrogen exerts an interfering effect on COMT activity. We examined 323 young healthy Chinese Han subjects and analyzed the gray matter volume (GMV) differences between Val/Val individuals and Met carriers in a voxel-wise manner throughout the whole brain. We were interested in genotype effects and genotype × gender interactions. We then extracted these brain regions with GMV differences as seeds to compute resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) with the rest of the brain; we also tested the genotypic differences and gender interactions in the rsFCs. Val/Val individuals showed decreased GMV in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) compared with Met carriers; decreased GMV in the medial superior frontal gyrus (mSFG) was found only in male Val/Val subjects. The rsFC analysis revealed that both the PCC and mSFG were functionally correlated with brain regions of the default mode network (DMN). Both of these regions showed decreased rsFCs with different parts of the frontopolar cortex of the DMN in Val/Val individuals than Met carriers. Our findings suggest that the COMT Val158Met polymorphism modulates both the structure and functional connectivity within the DMN and that gender interactions should be considered in studies of the effect of this genetic variant, especially those involving prefrontal morphology."

Molecular analysis was performed to evaluate whether Gas7b associates with actin filaments and microtubules, and the data revealed two novel roles of Gas7b in neurite outgrowth: we showed that Gas7b enhances bundling of several microtubule filaments and connects microtubules with actin filaments. These results suggest that Gas7b governs neural cell morphogenesis by enhancing the coordination between actin filaments and microtubules. We conclude that lower neuronal Gas7b levels may impact Alzheimer disease progression."

https://openalex.org/W2141810976,"The proliferation of oil palm plantations has led to dramatic changes in tropical landscapes across the globe. However, relatively little is known about the effects of oil palm expansion on biodiversity, especially in key ecosystem-service providing organisms like pollinators. Rapid land use change is exacerbated by limited knowledge of the mechanisms causing biodiversity decline in the tropics, particularly those involving landscape features. We examined these mechanisms by undertaking a survey of orchid bees, a well-known group of Neotropical pollinators, across forest and oil palm plantations in Costa Rica. We used chemical baits to survey the community in four regions: continuous forest sites, oil palm sites immediately adjacent to forest, oil palm sites 2 km from forest, and oil palm sites greater than 5 km from forest. We found that although orchid bees are present in all environments, orchid bee communities diverged across the gradient, and community richness, abundance, and similarity to forest declined as distance from forest increased. In addition, mean phylogenetic distance of the orchid bee community declined and was more clustered in oil palm. Community traits also differed with individuals in oil palm having shorter average tongue length and larger average geographic range size than those in the forest. Our results indicate two key features about Neotropical landscapes that contain oil palm: 1) oil palm is selectively permeable to orchid bees and 2) orchid bee communities in oil palm have distinct phylogenetic and trait structure compared to communities in forest. These results suggest that conservation and management efforts in oil palm-cultivating regions should focus on landscape features."
https://openalex.org/W2030610692,"ATP-dependent proteases are responsible for most energy-dependent protein degradation across all species. Proteases initially bind an unstructured region on a substrate and then translocate along the polypeptide chain, unfolding and degrading protein domains as they are encountered. Although this process is normally processive, resulting in the complete degradation of substrate proteins to small peptides, some substrates are released prematurely. Regions of low sequence complexity within the substrate such as the glycine-rich region (GRR) from p105 or glycine-alanine repeats (GAr) from the EBNA1 (Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen-1) protein, can trigger partial degradation and fragment release. Loss of processivity could be due to inability to hold on to the substrate (faster release) or inability to unfold and degrade a substrate domain (slower unfolding). I previously showed that the GRR slows domain unfolding by the proteasome (Kraut, D. A., Israeli, E., Schrader, E. K., Patil, A., Nakai, K., Nanavati, D., Inobe, T., and Matouschek, A.

Here, I show that these apparently contradictory results can be reconciled through a reanalysis of the ClpXP GAr data. This reanalysis shows that, as with the proteasome, low complexity sequences in substrates slow their unfolding and degradation by ClpXP, with little effect on release rates. Thus, despite their evolutionary distance and limited sequence identity, both ClpXP and the proteasome share a common mechanism by which substrate sequences regulate the processivity of degradation.

https://openalex.org/W2324178304,Humans and animals readily generalize previously learned knowledge to new situations. Determining similarity is critical for assigning category membership to a novel stimulus. We tested the hypothesis that category membership is initially encoded by the similarity of the activity pattern evoked by a novel stimulus to the patterns from known categories. We provide behavioral and neurophysiological evidence that activity patterns in primary auditory cortex contain sufficient information to explain behavioral categorization of novel speech sounds by rats. Our results suggest that category membership might be encoded by the similarity of the activity pattern evoked by a novel speech sound to the patterns evoked by known sounds. Categorization based on featureless pattern matching may represent a general neural mechanism for ensuring accurate generalization across sensory and cognitive systems.

https://openalex.org/W1979707851,"During cycles of fasting and feeding, liver function is regulated by both transcriptional and post-translational events. Regulated protein degradation has recently emerged as a key mechanism to control abundance of specific hepatic proteins under different nutritional conditions. As glucagon signaling through cAMP and PKA is central to glucose output during fasting, we hypothesized that this signaling pathway may also regulate ubiquitin ligases in the fasted state. Here we show that fasting stimuli promote expression of the short isoform of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4l in primary mouse hepatocytes. Nedd4l-short mRNA and NEDD4L (short isoform) protein accumulate in glucagon-treated primary mouse hepatocytes and in liver tissues during fasting. We identified a functional cAMP response element in the alternate Nedd4l-short promoter; mutation of this element blunts cAMP-induced expression of a Nedd4l reporter construct. CREB occupies the endogenous Nedd4l locus near this element. CREB and its co-activator CRTC2, both activated by fasting stimuli, contribute to glucagon-stimulated Nedd4l-short expression in primary hepatocytes. siRNA-mediated Nedd4l depletion in primary hepatocytes did not affect gluconeogenic gene expression, glucose output or glycogen synthesis. Our findings reveal a new mechanism of Nedd4l transcriptional regulation in liver cells."

Changes in their expression are associated with many pathological conditions; thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms regulating expression of mylk1 gene transcripts. Previously, we reported a highly conserved CArG box, which binds serum response factor, in intron 15 of mylk1. Because this CArG element is near the promoter that drives transcription of the 130-kDa smMLCK, we examined its role in regulating expression of this transcript. Results show that deletion of the intronic CArG region from a β-galactosidase reporter gene abolished transgene expression in mice in vivo. Deletion of the CArG region from the endogenous mylk1 gene, specifically in smooth muscle cells, decreased expression of the 130-kDa smMLCK by 40% without affecting expression of the 220-kDa MLCK or telokin.

It is characterized by cartilage destruction and bone remodeling, mediated in part by synovial fibroblasts (SFs). Given the functional significance of cadherins in these cells, we aimed at determining the role of genetic variants of N-cadherin (CDH2) in OA of the knee and hip. Six single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the genomic region of the CDH2 gene were genotyped in 312 patients with OA and 259 healthy control subjects. Gene expression of CDH2 was analyzed by qRT-PCR. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify a transcription factor isolated by DNA pulldown. Its potential for binding to gene variants was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Genetic analysis identified a polymorphism located in the CDH2 promoter region to be associated with risk of OA. The minor allele of rs11564299 had a protective effect against OA. Compared to carriers of the major allele, carriers of the minor allele of rs11564299 displayed increased N-cadherin levels in SFs. Based on in silico analysis, the minor allele was predicted to generate a novel transcription factor binding site, Direct-binding assays and mass spectrometric analysis identified hnRNP K as binding selectively to the minor allele. In summary, a CDH2 promoter polymorphism influences the risk of OA, and hnRNP K was found to be involved in the regulation of elevated N-cadherin expression in patients with OA carrying the minor allele of rs11564299."

PIPKIγi2 directly interacted with the C-terminal tail of Src and regulated its subcellular localization in concert with talin, a cytoskeletal protein targeted to focal adhesions. Co-expression of PIPKIγi2 and Src synergistically induced the anchorage-independent growth of nonmalignant cells. This study uncovers a novel mechanism where a phosphoinositide-synthesizing enzyme, PIPKIγi2, functions with the proto-oncogene Src, to regulate oncogenic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2053522883,"Background Current estimates of diabetes prevalence in the Republic of Ireland (RoI) are based on UK epidemiological studies. This study uses Irish data to describe the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed diabetes amongst all adults aged 18+ years and undiagnosed diabetes amongst those aged 45+ years. Methods The survey of lifestyle attitudes and nutrition (SLAN) 2007 is based on a nationally representative sample of Irish adults aged 18+ years (n = 10,364). Self-reported doctor-diagnosed diabetes was recorded for respondents in the full sample. Diabetes medication use, measured height and weight, and non-fasting blood samples were variously recorded in sub-samples of younger (n = 967) and older (n = 1,207) respondents. Results The prevalence of doctor-diagnosed diabetes amongst adults aged 18+ years was 3.5% (95% CI 3.1% - 3.9%). After adjustment for other explanatory variables; the risk of self-reported doctor-diagnosed diabetes was significantly related to age (p < 0.0001), employment status (p = 0.0003) and obesity (p = 0.0003). Amongst adults aged 45+ years, the prevalence of doctor-diagnosed diabetes was 8.9% (95% CI 7.3% -10.5%) and undiagnosed diabetes was 2.8% (95% CI 1.4% - 4.1%). This represented 31.2% of diabetes cases in this age group. Conclusion Notwithstanding methodological differences, these prevalence estimates are consistent with those in the UK and France. However, the percentage of undiagnosed cases amongst adults aged 45+ years appears to be higher in the RoI. Increased efforts to improve early detection and population level interventions to address adverse diet and lifestyle factors are urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W2083972362,"Repetitive or prolonged muscle contractions induce muscular fatigue, defined as the inability of the muscle to maintain the initial tension or power output. In the present experiments, made on intact fiber bundles from FDB mouse, fatigue and recovery from fatigue were investigated at 24°C and 35°C. Force and stiffness were measured during tetani elicited every 90 s during the pre-fatigue control phase and recovery and every 1.5 s during the fatiguing phase made of 105 consecutive tetani. The results showed that force decline could be split in an initial phase followed by a later one. Loss of force during the first phase was smaller and slower at 35°C than at 24°C, whereas force decline during the later phase was greater at 35°C so that total force depression at the end of fatigue was the same at both temperatures. The initial force decline occurred without great reduction of fiber stiffness and was attributed to a decrease of the average force per attached crossbridge. Force decline during the later phase was accompanied by a proportional stiffness decrease and was attributed to a decrease of the number of attached crossbridge. Similarly to fatigue, at both 24 and 35°C, force recovery occurred in two phases: the first associated with the recovery of the average force per attached crossbridge and the second due to the recovery of the pre-fatigue attached crossbridge number. These changes, symmetrical to those occurring during fatigue, are consistent with the idea that, i) initial phase is due to the direct fast inhibitory effect of [Pi]i increase during fatigue on crossbridge force; ii) the second phase is due to the delayed reduction of Ca2+ release and /or reduction of the Ca2+ sensitivity of the myofibrils due to high [Pi]i."
https://openalex.org/W2016500191,"A retrospective analysis of the Taiwanese National Birth Defect Registration and Notification System was conducted in order to determine the live birth- and stillbirth rates in infants with Down syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 13 and Turner syndrome between 2001 and 2010. The objective was to investigate the impact of Down syndrome screening on the Taiwanese Down syndrome live birth rate. In addition, the results of first-trimester Down syndrome screening between 2006 and 2011, and of second-trimester quadruple testing between 2008 and 2011, were obtained from the National Taiwan University Hospital. All Taiwanese infants born between 2001 and 2010 were included in the first part of the analysis, and women receiving first-trimester Down syndrome screening or second-trimester quadruple testing from the National Taiwan University Hospital were included in the second part. The live birth rate of infants with Down syndrome, per 100 000 live births, decreased from 22.28 in 2001 to 7.79 in 2010. The ratio of liveborn DS to total DS was 48.74% in 2001, and then decreased to 25.88% in 2006, when first-trimester screening was widely introduced in Taiwan. This ratio dropped to 20.64% in 2008, when the second-trimester quadruple test was implemented. The overall positive rate in first-trimester screening in the National Taiwan University Hospital was 3.1%, with a Down syndrome detection rate of 100%; the quadruple test had values of 9.0% and 75%, respectively. The use of first-trimester screening and the second-trimester quadruple test may be responsible for the marked decrease in the Taiwanese Down syndrome live birth rate observed between 2001 and 2010."
https://openalex.org/W2033331400,"Objectives So many clinical trials of positive inotropes have failed, that it is now axiomatic that agents that increase cAMP are deleterious to the failing heart. An alternative strategy is to alter myocardial Ca2+ handling or myofilament response to Ca2+ using agents that do not affect cAMP. Although left ventricular (LV) function is tightly linked to adenylyl cyclase (AC) activity, the beneficial effects of AC may be independent of cAMP and instead stem from effects on Ca2+ handling. Here we ask whether an AC mutant molecule that reduces LV cAMP production would have favorable effects on LV function through its effects on Ca2+ handling alone. Methods and Results We generated transgenic mice with cardiac-directed expression of an AC6 mutant (AC6mut). Cardiac myocytes showed impaired cAMP production in response to isoproterenol (74% reduction; p<0.001), but LV size and function were normal. Isolated hearts showed preserved LV function in response to isoproterenol stimulation. AC6mut expression was associated with increased sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake and the EC50 for SERCA2a activation was reduced. Cardiac myocytes isolated from AC6mut mice showed increased amplitude of Ca2+ transients in response to isoproterenol (p = 0.0001). AC6mut expression also was associated with increased expression of LV S100A1 (p = 0.03) and reduced expression of phospholamban protein (p = 0.01). Conclusion LV AC mutant expression is associated with normal cardiac function despite impaired cAMP generation. The mechanism appears to be through effects on Ca2+ handling — effects that occur despite diminished cAMP."

Here, we examined the influence of deactivating each complementarity-determining region (CDR) within a multifunctional anti-nucleic acid antibody (Ab) that possesses these activities, the catalytic 3D8 single chain variable fragment (scFv). CDR-deactivated 3D8 scFv variants were generated by replacing all of the amino acids within each CDR with Gly/Ser residues. The structure of 3D8 scFv accommodated single complete CDR deactivations. Different functional activities of 3D8 scFv were affected differently depending on which CDR was deactivated. The only exception was CDR1, located within the light chain (LCDR1); deactivation of LCDR1 abolished all of the functional activities of 3D8 scFv. A hybrid Ab, HW6/3D8L1, in which the LCDR1 from an unrelated Ab (HW6) was replaced with the LCDR1 from 3D8, acquired all activities associated with the 3D8 scFv. These results suggest that the activity of a multifunctional 3D8 scFv Ab can be modulated by single complete CDR deactivation and that the LCDR1 plays a crucial role in maintaining Ab properties.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of each CDR in the activities of 3D8 scFv by analyzing the effect of single complete CDR deactivations. To do this we generated six CDR-deactivated 3D8 scFv variants, each of which contained one CDR in which all the amino acid residues were replaced with a non-charged flexible sequence of repeated Gly/Ser residues, and examined both their secondary structures and their DNA binding, DNA-hydrolysis, and cell-penetration activities. Moreover, to clarify the role of LCDR1 in 3D8 activities, we performed biochemical examination of the peptides corresponding to the 3D8 CDRs as well as a hybrid Ab, HW6/3D8L1, in which the LCDR1 of human HW6 (an anti-death receptor 5 (DR5) Ab) was replaced with the LCDR1 from 3D8. CDR-replaced VH (variable domain of heavy chain) and VL (variable domain of light chain) genes were synthesized by GenScript Inc. The genes were subcloned into the pIg20 vector, which contains a Protein A tag (7 kDa), using XmaI and NcoI restriction sites. This resulted in the pIg20-scFv expression vector in which VH and VL are connected by a (Gly-4/Ser-1)3 linker. ScFv proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified from bacterial culture supernatants in a soluble form by IgG-Sepharose chromatography (15Kim Y.R. Kim J.S. Lee S.H. Lee W.R. Sohn J.N. Chung Y.C.

The concentrations of scFv proteins (mg ml−1 cm−1) were determined using extinction coefficients at 280 nm, which were calculated from the respective amino acid sequences. Peptides N-terminally labeled with either FITC or biotin were synthesized by Peptron Inc. (Korea). The far-UV CD spectra of scFv proteins were recorded on a J-20 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Japan) at a concentration of 0.5–1.0 mg/ml in Tris buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at 25 °C using a thermostated cuvette with a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell. Spectra were scanned from 260 to 190 nm at a scan speed of 5 nm/min. Kinetic measurement of the interaction between scFvs and single-stranded ssDNA was performed using a Biacore 2000 instrument (GE Healthcare ) at 25 °C. scFvs were diluted in HBS-EP (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA) containing 0.005% surfactant P-20. The same buffer was used as the running buffer. The substrate, ss-(dN)40 DNA labeled with biotin at the 5′-end (bio-ss-(dN)40, 5′-CCATGAGTGATAACACTGCGGCCAACTTACTTCTGACAAC-3′), was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. Briefly, ss-(dN)40 DNA (1 μm) was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated sensor chip SA (Amersham Biosciences) at a level of 200–800 response units. 3D8-Hi proteins (serially diluted from 25 to 0.8 nm) and 3D8-Li proteins (serially diluted from 200 to 0.4 nm) were injected into the flow cell for 3 min at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. All kinetic parameters were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis according to a 1:1 binding model using BIA evaluation software (Version 3.2). The dissociation constant, KD,was calculated using the formula KD = koff/kon, where koff and kon are the dissociation and association rate constants, respectively. To detect internalized scFvs, HeLa cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well and incubated with 5 μm scFvs in serum-free medium for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, cell membranes were permeabilized with “P” buffer (1% BSA, 0.1% saponin, and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS) and incubated with rabbit IgG (2 μg/ml) followed by FITC-anti-rabbit IgG. Each incubation step was performed for 1 h at 4 °C followed by washing with ice-cold PBS. Finally, the cells were suspended in 4% paraformaldehyde-PBS and analyzed using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). In some cases the permeabilization step was omitted. To detect internalized peptides, HeLa cells were incubated with 10 μm FITC-labeled peptides in serum-free TOMTM medium for 2 h at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed and analyzed by flow cytometry. To detect scFvs, HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips in 24-well plates at a density of 4 × 104 cells/well and incubated with 5 μm scFvs in serum-free medium for 6 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed, fixed, and permeabilized as described for flow cytometry experiments. To detect peptides, HeLa cells were incubated with 10 μm FITC-labeled peptides in serum-free medium for 2 h at 37 °C and then fixed. The cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min at room temperature. Images were obtained using a laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (model LSM710, Carl Zeiss). To assay the heparin binding activity of scFvs, various concentrations (1.3–10 μg/ml) of scFvs were incubated in 96-well polystyrene plates coated with heparin (10 μg/ml; Sigma). To assay DNA binding activity, scFvs were incubated in wells coated with bio-ss-(dN)40 DNA (1 μm). Bound proteins were detected using rabbit IgG (Sigma) followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce) as described previously (15Kim Y.R. Kim J.S. Lee S.H. Lee W.R. Sohn J.N.

Chem. 2006; 281: 15287-15295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To assay the binding of peptides to heparin or DNA, biotin-labeled peptides were incubated in wells coated with pUC57 plasmid DNA (2 μg/ml) or heparin (10 μg/ml). Bound peptides were detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate (Sigma). To assay the human DR5 binding activity of scFvs, wells were coated with DR5 protein (2 μg/ml) obtained from PeproTech. A DNA substrate composed of 21 nucleotides labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) at the 5′ terminus and a black hole quencher (BHQ) at the 3′ terminus (5′ FAM-CGATGAGTGCCATGGATATAC-BHQ 3′) was generated by M-Biotech. scFvs (1 μm), peptide (1 μm), or DNase I (1 unit) was either preincubated or not with heparin (a competitor molecule; 10 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature before being loaded into the wells of a 96-black-well plate containing DNA substrate (250 nm). Immediately after addition to the DNA substrate, the fluorescence intensity was read in real time over a period of 6 h at 37 °C in a fluorescence detector (Molecular Devices). Each reaction was brought to a final volume of 100 μl with TBSM buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2). ScFv proteins were purified to homogeneity as soluble proteins with molecular masses of ∼34 kDa (Fig. 1). Approximately 1–5 mg of each scFv protein was obtained from 1 liter of the supernatant of cultured Escherichia coli. For CDR substitution, we chose a sequence of repetitive non-charged small (Gly/Ser) residues that are commonly used for the inactivation of specific domains (21Jakobi A.J. Mashaghi A. Tans S.J. Huizinga E.G. Calcium modulates force sensing by the von Willebrand factor A2 domain.Nat. Commun. 2011; 2: 385Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Each scFv was named according to the position of the CDR replaced with Gly/Ser residues. For example, 3D8-H1i denotes an scFv in which HCDR1 of 3D8 was replaced, and 3D8-L3i denotes an scFv in which LCDR3 was replaced. Because the deactivation of any CDR may cause improper folding of scFv, the secondary structures of the six purified scFv variants were monitored by far-UV CD spectroscopy. The far-UV CD spectra of the three 3D8-Hi (Fig. 2A) and three 3D8-Li variants (Fig. 2B) showed that their secondary structures were predominantly β-sheets, as expected for typical members of the functional immunoglobulin family, including scFvs (22Greenfield N.J.

These data indicate that all scFv variants folded properly and that single CDR deactivations in 3D8 scFv did not cause significant structural distortions. We first measured the affinity of the CDR-deactivated scFvs for a synthetic ss-(dN)40 DNA using SPR (Table 1). Wild-type 3D8 scFv bound to ss-(dN)40 in a concentration-dependent manner, with an affinity similar to that reported previously (15Kim Y.R. Kim J.S. Lee S.H. Lee W.R. Sohn J.N. Chung Y.C. Shim H.K.

From the kinetic binding parameters, kon and koff, we calculated the KD of wild-type 3D8 scFv to be ∼41 nm. The binding affinities of the 3D8-Hi variants were either slightly higher (2-fold higher for 3D8-H2i) or lower (2–5-fold lower for 3D8-H1i and 3D8-H3i). With respect to the 3D8-Li variants, the affinities of 3D8-L2i and 3D8-L3i were either slightly higher (4-fold) or lower (3-fold) than that of the wild-type scFv. However, 3D8-L1i did not bind to ss-(dN)40. BSA (100 μm; negative control) did not bind to the surface of the ss-(dN)40-immobilized chip (data not shown). Taken together, these data indicate that the DNA binding activity of 3D8 is not completely abolished by the deactivation of a single CDR, except in the case of the LCDR1. This suggests that LCDR1 may be crucial for the DNA binding activity and/or structural stability of scFv.TABLE 1SPR-derived kinetic binding parameters of the interaction between 3D8 variants and single-stranded DNA substratesProteinKonKoffKDm−1 s−1s−1m3D8(5.77 ± 0.17) × 104(2.37 ± 0.05) × 10−3(4.11 ± 0.20) × 10−83D8-H1i(1.79 ± 0.00) × 103(3.49 ± 0.13) × 10−4(1.95 ± 0.07) × 10−73D8-H2i(2.83 ± 0.07) × 105(4.75 ± 0.23) × 10−3(1.68 ± 0.12) × 10−83D8-H3i(4.50 ± 0.11) × 104(4.64 ± 0.06) × 10−3(1.03 ± 0.04) × 10−73D8-L1i(1.09 ± 0.02) × 102(1.14 ± 0.02) × 10−2(1.05 ± 0.03) × 10−43D8-L2i(1.82 ± 0.09) × 104(2.43 ± 0.09) × 10−3(1.34 ± 0.13) × 10−73D8-L3i(6.44 ± 0.20) × 105(7.23 ± 0.30) × 10−3(1.13 ± 0.17) × 10−8 Open table in a new tab We next analyzed uptake of the different scFvs in permeabilized HeLa cells and the amount of scFv bound to the surface of non-permeabilized cells by flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with the scFvs for 6 h at 37 °C. The cell membranes were then fixed and either permeabilized or not to distinguish cell surface-bound (Fig. 3, A and B, left panels) from endocytosed scFv (Fig. 3, A and B, right panels). Compared with wild-type 3d8 scFv, the three 3D8-Hi variants were internalized much less efficiently, and large amounts of 3D8-H2i and 3D8-H3i proteins remained bound to cell surface after washing (Fig. 3A). For the 3D8-Li variants, 3D8-L3i was endocytosed to the same extent as the wild-type 3D8 scFv, whereas 3D8-L1i and 3D8-L2i neither bound to nor entered the cells (Fig. 3B). The negative control, HW6 scFv, did not generate a signal. The flow cytometry data with permeabilized cells were supported by confocal microscopy (Fig. 3C). Thus, the cell-penetrating activity of 3D8 scFv was relatively resistant to the deactivation of LCDR3 compared with deactivation of the other CDRs. Previous studies suggest that heparan sulfate proteoglycans function as cell surface receptors that recognize anti-DNA Abs, and that anti-DNA Abs cross-react with negatively charged heparan sulfate epitopes (7Song Y.C.

Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 1824-1830Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next examined the heparin binding activity of the 3D8 variants. We found that 3D8-H2i, 3D8-H3i, and 3D8-L3i bound strongly to heparin, a soluble heparan sulfate analog, in a manner comparable with that of the wild-type scFv, whereas the negative controls (HW6 scFv and DNase I) did not bind to heparin (Fig. 4A). 3D8-H2i, 3D8-H3i, and 3D8-L3i were also shown to be DNA binders (Table 1). Moreover, DNA binding of the strong heparin binders (3D8-H2i, 3D8-H3i, 3D8-L3i, and wild-type 3D8 scFv) was inhibited by heparin in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4B), indicating that heparan sulfate competes for the DNA-binding site of these scFvs. Taken together, the heparin binding activity of the scFvs correlated to either their cell surface binding (for 3D8-H2i and 3D8-H3i) or cell-penetrating (for 3D8-L3i and wild-type 3D8 scFv) activities, although cell surface binding was not necessarily correlated with cellular internalization. The DNA-hydrolyzing activity of the different scFv constructs was analyzed using a FRET-based DNA cleavage assay in which the hydrolysis of a DNA substrate double-labeled with a fluorophore at the 5′ terminus and its quencher at the 3′ terminus was measured according to the increase in fluorescence intensity. The assay was performed in the presence or absence of heparin, which competes with the 3D8 scFvs for DNA-binding sites (Fig. 4B). We hypothesized that if the DNA-hydrolyzing activity of the 3D8 scFvs was inhibited by heparin, then this would rule out any false positives caused by contamination. The DNA-hydrolyzing activity of wild-type 3D8 scFv was completely blocked by heparin; however, the DNA-hydrolyzing activity of DNase I, which does not bind to heparin, was not affected by heparin as expected (Fig. 5). At least three scFv variants, 3D8-H3i (Fig. 5A), 3D8-L2i, and 3D8-L3i (Fig. 5B), retained DNA-hydrolyzing activity in the absence of heparin, although the activity of 3D8-H3i was reduced by 45% and that of 3D8-L2i and 3D8-L3i was reduced by 75%. None of the 3D8 variants showed DNA-hydrolyzing activity in the presence of heparin, confirming that the DNA-hydrolyzing activity of scFv is due to the 3D8 proteins rather than to any contaminating proteins. We analyzed the DNA binding/hydrolyzing, heparin binding, and cell-penetrating activities of CDR-derived peptides that were N-terminally labeled with either biotin or FITC. The amino acid sequence, length, and pI value of the six peptides corresponding to the CDRs of 3D8 scFv are shown in Table 2. Also shown are two control peptides: a positive control pep-Tat, which has a high cell penetration efficiency (28Gump J.M. Dowdy S.F. TAT transduction: the molecular mechanism and therapeutic prospects.Trends Mol. Med. 2007; 13: 443-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and a negative control pep-VHFR3 derived from a part of the FR (framework region) in the 3D8 heavy chain.TABLE 2The 3D8 CDR peptides and control peptides used in this studyPeptideAmino acid sequenceLengthpIpep-H1SYVMH56.5pep-H2YINPYNDGTK105.8pep-H3GAYKRGYAMDY118.4pep-L1KSSQSLFNSRTRKNYLA1711.1pep-L2WASTRES76.0pep-L3KQSYYHMYT98.4pep-VHFR3KSSSTAYMEL106.0pep-TatGRKKRRQRRRPPQ1312.7 Open table in a new tab ELISA results showed that the pI value of the peptide was directly proportional to its DNA binding (Fig. 6A) and heparin binding (Fig. 6B) activity. The degree of binding activity was pep-Tat (pI 12.7) > LCDR1 peptide (pep-L1; pI 11.1). Thus, electrostatic interactions between the basic residues within the proteins and the negatively charged DNA and heparin molecules may be the primary factor that determines the strength of binding. None of the CDR-derived peptides showed DNA-hydrolyzing activity (Fig. 6C). Only the pep-H1 and pep-H2 peptides showed cell-penetration activity, but the level of entry was <10% that observed for the Tat control peptide (Fig. 6D). A representative confocal microscopic image of the internalized pep-H1 is shown in Fig. 6E. These data indicate that the amino acid sequence of a CDR-derived peptide, rather than its pI, determines whether it is internalized by a cell. We expected pep-L1 to penetrate the cells because LCDR1-deactivated scFv failed to show either DNA binding or cell penetration activity; however"
https://openalex.org/W2089951936,"Objective: Ischemic pre-conditioning and post-conditioning are useful manipulations to reduce the undesirable effects of ischemia-reperfusion skin flap each. But the impact of post-conditioning on the pre-conditioning skin flap is not manifested. Here we investigated the influence of ischemic post-conditioning in a preconditioned axial pattern skin flap model. Method: We used the skin flap in 40 rabbits and divided them into 5 groups randomly. At first we induced the ischemic pre-conditioning of the flap which was applied by 2 periods of 15 minutes of ischemia/15 minutes of reperfusion cycle. Next post-conditioning was performed by 6 cycles of 10 seconds of repeated ischemia/reperfusion periods at different times of just after the reperfusion,5 minutes after the reperfusion,10 minutes after the reperfusion. The animals were allocated into 5 groups: group 1 (Ischemia Group); group 2: (Pre-conditioning Group); group 3: (Pre-conditioning+ Post-conditioning Group); group 4 (Pre-conditioning+ Post-conditioning 5 minutes later Group); group5 (Pre-conditioning+ Post-conditioning 10 minutes later). The neutrophil count was assessed with histologic analysis before the dissection of the skin flap. Flap viability was assessed 1 week after the operation, and surviving flap area was recorded as a percentage of the whole flap area. LSD test was used for statistical analysis among different groups to evaluate the effects of ischemic pre-conditioning against ischemia. Result: Among the varying groups, the neutrophil count varied: Group 1 was50.12±5.91; Group 2, 30.00±2.00, and Group 3, 18.87±3; Group 4, 22.50±1.92; Group 5, 30.12±1.88.The mean± SD surviving areas of the flaps for groups 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were 31.76±4.59, 51.26±3.24,82.18±5.28,66.85±3.87 and 51.13±2.90 respectively. Spearman correlation analysis shows an increase relation between neutrophil count and flap survival rate in the different groups (P <0.05). Conclusion: Ischemic post-conditioning has protective effect on ischemic preconditioned skin flaps, but the post-conditioning should be performed within 5 minutes after the end of ischemia."
