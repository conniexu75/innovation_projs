https://openalex.org/W1984979116,Impaired axonal transport in motor neurons has been proposed as a mechanism for neuronal degeneration in motor neuron disease. Here we show linkage of a lower motor neuron disease to a region of 4 Mb at chromosome 2p13. Mutation analysis of a gene in this interval that encodes the largest subunit of the axonal transport protein dynactin showed a single base-pair change resulting in an amino-acid substitution that is predicted to distort the folding of dynactin's microtubule-binding domain. Binding assays show decreased binding of the mutant protein to microtubules. Our results show that dysfunction of dynactin-mediated transport can lead to human motor neuron disease.

We establish here that loss-of-function mutations in FGFR1 underlie KAL2 whereas a gain-of-function mutation in FGFR1 has been shown to cause a form of craniosynostosis. Moreover, we suggest that the KAL1 gene product, the extracellular matrix protein anosmin-1, is involved in FGF signaling and propose that the gender difference in anosmin-1 dosage (because KAL1 partially escapes X inactivation) explains the higher prevalence of the disease in males."
https://openalex.org/W1543151032,"The precursor function of the ubiquitous glial cell type in the developing central nervous system (CNS), the radial glia, is largely unknown. Using Cre/loxP in vivo fate mapping studies, we found that radial glia generate virtually all cortical projection neurons but not the interneurons originating in the ventral telencephalon. In contrast to the cerebral cortex, few neurons in the basal ganglia originate from radial glia, and in vitro lineage analysis revealed intrinsic differences in the potential of radial glia from the dorsal and ventral telencephalon. This shows that the progeny of radial glia not only differs profoundly between brain regions but also includes the majority of neurons in some parts of the CNS."

https://openalex.org/W2115542528,"We investigate how the molecular and cellular maps of the Drosophila olfactory system are integrated. A correspondence is established between individual odor receptors, neurons, and odors. We describe the expression of the Or22a and Or22b receptor genes, show localization to dendritic membranes, and find sexual dimorphism. Or22a maps to the ab3A neuron, which responds to ethyl butyrate. Analysis of a deletion mutant lacking Or22a, along with transgenic rescue experiments, confirms the mapping and demonstrates that an Or gene is required for olfactory function in vivo. Ectopic expression of Or47a in a mutant cell identifies the neuron from which it derives and its odor ligands. Ectopic expression in a wild-type cell shows that two receptors can function in a single cell. The ab3A neuron does not depend on normal odor receptor gene expression to navigate to its target in the CNS."

https://openalex.org/W2047211900,"Mutations in parkin, which encodes a RING domain protein associated with ubiquitin ligase activity, lead to autosomal recessive Parkinson's disease characterized by midbrain dopamine neuron loss. Here we show that parkin functions in a multiprotein ubiquitin ligase complex that includes the F-box/WD repeat protein hSel-10 and Cullin-1. HSel-10 serves to target the parkin ubiquitin ligase activity to cyclin E, an hSel-10-interacting protein previously implicated in the regulation of neuronal apoptosis. Consistent with the notion that cyclin E is a substrate of the parkin ubiquitin ligase complex, parkin deficiency potentiates the accumulation of cyclin E in cultured postmitotic neurons exposed to the glutamatergic excitotoxin kainate and promotes their apoptosis. Furthermore, parkin overexpression attenuates the accumulation of cyclin E in toxin-treated primary neurons, including midbrain dopamine neurons, and protects them from apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W2153591653,"We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure activity in human early visual cortex (areas V1, V2 and V3) during a challenging contrast-detection task. Subjects attempted to detect the presence of slight contrast increments added to two kinds of background patterns. Behavioral responses were recorded so that the corresponding cortical activity could be grouped into the usual signal detection categories: hits, false alarms, misses and correct rejects. For both kinds of background patterns, the measured cortical activity was retinotopically specific. Hits and false alarms were associated with significantly more cortical activity than were correct rejects and misses. That false alarms evoked more activity than misses indicates that activity in early visual cortex corresponded to the subjects' percepts, rather than to the physically presented stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2146631034,"Current consensus holds that a single medullary network generates respiratory rhythm in mammals. Pre-Bötzinger Complex inspiratory (I) neurons, isolated in transverse slices, and preinspiratory (pre-I) neurons, found only in more intact en bloc preparations and in vivo, are each proposed as necessary for rhythm generation. Opioids slow I, but not pre-I, neuronal burst periods. In slices, opioids gradually lengthened respiratory periods, whereas in more intact preparations, periods jumped nondeterministically to integer multiples of the control period (quantal slowing). These findings suggest that opioid-induced quantal slowing results from transmission failure of rhythmic drive from pre-I neurons to preBötC I networks, depressed below threshold for spontaneous rhythmic activity. Thus, both I (in the slice), and pre-I neurons are sufficient for respiratory rhythmogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2153053799,"Poly(ADP-ribosylation), primarily via poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), is a pluripotent cellular process important for maintenance of genomic integrity and RNA transcription in cells. However, during conditions of oxidative stress and energy depletion, poly(ADP-ribosylation) paradoxically contributes to mitochondrial failure and cell death. Although it has been presumed that poly(ADP-ribosylation) within the nucleus mediates this pathologic process, PARP-1 and other poly(ADP-ribosyltransferases) are also localized within mitochondria. To this end, the presence of PARP-1 and poly(ADP-ribosylation) were verified within mitochondrial fractions from primary cortical neurons and fibroblasts. Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosylation) within the mitochondrial compartment preserved transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), NAD+content, and cellular respiration, prevented release of apoptosis-inducing factor, and reduced neuronal cell death triggered by oxidative stress. Treatment with liposomal NAD+ also preserved ΔΨm and cellular respiration during oxidative stress. Furthermore, inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosylation) prevented intranuclear localization of apoptosis-inducing factor and protected neurons from excitotoxic injury; and PARP-1 null fibroblasts were protected from oxidative stress-induced cell death. Collectively these data suggest that poly(ADP-ribosylation) compartmentalized to the mitochondria can be converted from a homeostatic process to a mechanism of cell death when oxidative stress is accompanied by energy depletion.

The presumptive mechanism for this neurotoxic effect involves, sequentially, increases in [Ca2+]i via glutamate receptors, activation of nitric-oxide synthase, generation of the free radical peroxynitrite (ONOO−), activation of PARP-1 in response to genomic DNA damage, consumption of NAD+ during the formation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymers, and death via energy failure (5Szabo C. Zingarelli B. O'Connor M. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1753-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). However, the capacity for PARP-1 activation within the nucleus to deplete total cellular energy stores, particularly compartmentalized within mitochondria, remains to be established (4Yu S.W. Wang H.

Treatment with liposome-encapsulated NAD+ or ATP also preserved ΔΨm and cellular respiration, suggesting that cells can also be rescued by energy repletion after oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that NAD+ depletion and energy failure convert poly(ADP-ribosylation) compartmentalized within mitochondria from a homeostatic process to a mechanism of neuronal death, providing a unifying mechanism by which PARP-1 can regulate cell death under conditions of mitochondrial dysfunction, and identifying multiple intracellular targets for inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribosylation). These findings have relevance to both acute and chronic central nervous system diseases where oxidative stress is a contributing factor, including stroke, traumatic brain injury, seizures, and Parkinson's disease and other neurondegenerative diseases (12Virag L.

Briefly, 1 μg of mitochondrial or nuclear protein extracts were incubated in reaction buffer containing histones and [32P]NAD ± exogenous DNA with strand breaks. After incubating at room temperature for 10 min, reactions were terminated and proteins were precipitated with 20% trichloroacetic acid. Incorporation of 32P was determined by scintillation counting.Cell Cultures and Pharmacological StudiesPrimary cortical neuron-enriched cultures were prepared from 16 to 17-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat embryos as described (14Zhang X.

Dissociated cell suspensions were placed in 96-well plates (5 × 104 cells/well) or in plastic dishes coated with poly-d-lysine (1.3 × 107 cells/well). Experiments were performed between 7 and 12 days in vitro.ONOO−Neuron-enriched cultures were exposed to 100–250 μm ONOO− (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) in buffer for 30 min, whereupon fresh media was replaced.SIN-1—2 mm SIN-1 (Cayman Chemical) or 20% Me2SO vehicle in culture media was added to cells in 96-well plates.GlutamateCells were exposed to varying concentrations ofl-glutamate with 5 μm glycine (Sigma) in culture media for 10 min. Cultures were pre- or post- treated with either the PARP inhibitor 5-iodo-6-amino-1,2-benzyopyrone (INH2BP) (6Virag L. Salzman A.L. Szabo C. J.

Liposomal NAD+ and ATP were prepared using a modification of the thin-film method (18Han Y.Y. Huang L. Jackson E.J. Dubey R.K. Gillepsie D.G. Carcillo J.A. Res. Commun. Mol. Pathol.

For cytotoxicity experiments cells were exposed to 250 μm ONOO− with or without 100 μm INH2BP.Immunocytochemistry and Confocal MicroscopyNeurons grown on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips were fixed for 30 min in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (pH 7.4). Cells were incubated with 5% normal donkey serum and 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 for 1 h to permeabilize cell membranes. The cells were then incubated in a 1:100 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-HSP60 (StressGen, Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) and a 1:200 dilution of poly(ADP-ribose) (Biomol, Reading, PA) for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by incubation in the appropriate secondary antibody. Cells were examined using a Leica TCS NT confocal tri-laser scanning inverted microscope (Wetzlar, Germany) as previously described (14Zhang X. Chen J. Graham S.H. Du L. Kochanek P.M. Draviam R.

Chen J. Graham S.H. Du L. Kochanek P.M. Draviam R. Guo F. Nathaniel P.D. Szabo C. Watkins S.C. Clark R.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and Western blotting was performed using primary antibodies against: poly(ADP-ribose) polymers (BioMol, Reading, PA), PARP (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), the carboxyl terminus of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), cytochrome c (BD Pharmingen), and cytochromec oxidase (BD Pharmingen) at optimized dilutions.Assessment of ΔΨmΔΨm was determined using 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolocarbocyanine iodide (JC-1), a cationic dye that accumulates in mitochondria in a membrane potential-dependent manner (19Buckman J.F. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5054-5065Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data are presented as a green (488/580 nm)/red (535/610 nm) fluorescence intensity ratio, with an increased ratio representing mitochondrial depolarization. Cells grown on collagen-coated coverslips were incubated in 1 μg/ml JC-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 20 min at 37 °C. Cells were pretreated with INH2BP, FP-15, or vehicle. The media was replaced with buffer containing ONOO− for 5 min, whereupon the ONOO− was removed and media was replaced. Green/red fluorescent ratios were measured in five predefined fields containing 2–5 cells/field using an Olympus IX70 microscope with a ×60 oil immersion 1.4 numerical aperature optic and an automated stage. Image acquisition and analysis were performed using Simple PCI (Compix, Inc., Cranberry, PA). A minimum of 2 coverslips were imaged per condition.Determination of NAD+Cellular NAD+ levels were measured by the enzymatic cycling method using alcohol dehydrogenase (20Nisselbaum J.S. Green S. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 212-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) with modifications. Cells were homogenized in 0.05 m K phosphate buffer containing 0.1 m nicotinamide (pH 6.0), frozen rapidly, placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, then cooled in an ice bath for 5 min. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 rpm at 4 °C, then added to a reaction mixture containing 0.065 mglycylglycine, 0.1 m nicotinamide, 0.5 methanol, alcohol dehydrogenase, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT), and phenazine methosulfate at pH 7.4. NAD+ in the sample generates NADH, which reduces MTT through the intermediation of phenazine methosulfate to formazan. The reaction was allowed to run for 5 min and the absorbance determined at A556. A standard curve was generated using known concentrations of NAD+ and NAD+ levels were calculated.Pulsed Field Gel ElectrophoresisPulsed field gel electrophoresis was performed as described (14Zhang X. Chen J. Graham S.H. Du L. Kochanek P.M. Draviam R. Guo F. Nathaniel P.D. Szabo C. Watkins S.C. Clark R.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Briefly, chromosomal DNA samples were prepared in agarose plugs using a CHEF Mammalian Genomic DNA Plug Kit (Bio-Rad). Fragments were separated on a 1.2% agarose gel at 14 °C for 20 h. Field strengths were 180 V forward and 120 V reverse, initial and final switching time was set at 5–60 s with a linear ramp. The gel was stained with ethidium bromide and visualized under UV light.Isolated Brain MitochondriaAdult Sprague-Dawley rat brain mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (21Votyakova T.V. Reynolds I.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 79: 266-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial viability was verified by measuring oxygen consumption. Mitochondria were suspended in a reaction buffer to a final concentration of 1 mg of mitochondrial protein/ml and placed in reaction tubes. Drug or vehicle was added and the mitochondria were placed in a 37 °C water bath for 15 min, then 750 μm ONOO− or pH-adjusted vehicle were added. This concentration of ONOO− was found to completely depolarize mitochondria as determined by Safranin-O. Aliquots of the isolated mitochondrial suspensions were removed at baseline (−15 min), time 0 and 5 min, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and mitochondrial pellets and supernatants were frozen and stored for batch analysis. For assessment of mitochondrial protein release 20 μl of mitochondria supernatants were dialyzed against PBS in a mini-dialysis device (Pierce). Mitochondrial pellets were homogenized in lysis buffer and handled as described above.Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cell DeathFollowing cytotoxicity and drug treatments, cells were harvested using trypsin-EDTA, washed once in ice-cold PBS, and resuspended in 1 ml of Annexin V binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2). 1 × 105 cells were stained with 5 μl of Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and 5 μg/ml propridium iodide (PI) in 100 μl of Annexin V binding buffer at 4 °C. After 20 min, 400 μl of binding buffer was added to each tube and samples were analyzed using a tri-laser FACS Calibur flow cytometer.DISCUSSIONWhereas poly(ADP-ribosylation) contributes to cell homeostasis under basal conditions, pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PARP during conditions of cellular stress, e.g. energy failure or oxidative stress, is beneficial (2Eliasson M.J. Sampei K. Mandir A.S. Hurn P.D. Traystman R.J. Bao J. Pieper A. Wang Z.Q. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Dawson V.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 3Whalen M.J.

Under these circumstances, it has been proposed that ONOO− produces genomic DNA damage activating nuclear PARP-1, with subsequent cellular NAD+ depletion, followed by secondary mitochondrial injury, AIF release and nuclear translocation, and cell death (4Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). However, our data suggest that oxidative stress produces mitochondrial dysfunction directly by promoting rapid loss of ΔΨm. Intramitochondrial PARP activity during conditions of limited mitochondrial NAD+ stores related to impaired NAD recycling would exacerbate energy failure by consuming mitochondrial NAD+directly. In support of this, inhibition of basal mitochondrial poly(ADP-ribosylation) preserves ΔΨm, NAD+levels, and cellular respiration, prevents mitochondrial release of AIF, and attenuates large-scale DNA fragmentation and cell death after oxidative stress. Furthermore, replenishment of NAD+ also preserves ΔΨm and cellular respiration. These data indicate that inhibition of mitochondrial poly(ADP-ribosylation) and energy repletion represent effective strategies to protect cells in the face of insults producing energy failure, and are consistent with the presumption that energy depletion contributes to PARP-related cytotoxicity. PARP inhibition has also been shown to directly protect electron transport chain complexes from inactivation induced by oxidative stress (24Halmosi R. Berente Z. Osz E. Toth K. Literati-Nagy P. Sumegi B. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 59: 1497-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Similarly, NO inhibits mitochondrial metabolism (25Brorson J.R. Schumacker P.T. Zhang H. J.

In addition, compartmentalization of nitric-oxide synthase and oxygen radicals within mitochondria are a potential source of internally generated ONOO− (29Ghafourifar P. Schenk U. Klein S.D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4510-4516Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because mitochondrial nitric-oxide synthase is calcium-dependent, elevations in [Ca2+]i occurring under conditions of excitotoxicity could result in both activation of cytosolic and mitochondrial nitric-oxide synthase providing two sources of ONOO− (31Szabo C.

The results of this study do not discount the importance of nuclear PARP-1 activation in terms of cellular NAD+ consumption; however, it is apparent that mitochondrial poly(ADP-ribosylation) contributes at least in part to the determination of cellular fate under circumstances of NAD+ depletion and energy failure.Traditionally, PARP-mediated cell death has been felt to be primarily necrotic in nature (1Zhang J.

Recently, however, PARP-regulated programmed cell death mediated by AIF has been identified (4Yu S.W. Wang H. Poitras M.F. Coombs C. Bowers W.J. Federoff H.J. Poirier G.G. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 2002; 297: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). AIF-mediated programmed cell death has many phenotypic features of developmental apoptosis such as DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and regulation by bcl-2 family proteins; however, important differences also exist, such as large-scale versusoligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and cell death that progresses despite caspase inhibition (33Susin S.A.

Nature. 2001; 410: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1148) Google Scholar). Both necrotic and AIF-mediated programmed cell death are felt to be caspase-independent, and we have previously reported that the caspase inhibitorsN-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethylketone (VAD) and boc-Asp(OMe)-fluromethylketone (BAF) do not protect neurons from AIF-mediated cell death induced by ONOO− (14Zhang X. Chen J. Graham S.H. Du L. Kochanek P.M. Draviam R. Guo F. Nathaniel P.D. Szabo C. Watkins S.C. Clark R.S. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). In contrast, the present data show that the PARP inhibitor INH2BP protects cells from AIF-mediated cell death induced by ONOO− or glutamate. Whereas INH2BP reduced apoptotic cell death after ONOO− (PI extrusion and Annexin V binding; Fig.4c), after glutamate exposure cell death was reduced (PI extrusion; Fig. 6c) but a pre-apoptotic phenotype was expressed (PI−/Annexin V binding) in neurons. The concept that preventing apoptosis may switch the mode of cell death to necrosis is not novel (37Lemaire C. Andreau K. Souvannavong V. Adam A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar); however, these data suggest the possibility that preventing necrosis may switch the mode of cell death to apoptosis. This concept, particularly in paradigms that conserve cellular energy stores (38Leist M. Single B. Castoldi A.F. Kuhnle S. Nicotera P. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar, 39Los M. Mozoluk M. Ferrari D. Stepczynska A. Stroh C. Renz A. Herceg Z. Wang Z.Q. Schulze-Osthoff K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 978-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), warrants further study. PARP inhibition also reduced necrosis in fibroblasts exposed to ONOO−, demonstrating differences not only related to the cytotoxicity paradigm chosen, but also in the cell type used. Differences in response to ONOO− between fibroblasts and neurons may be related to dividing versus non-dividing cells, immortalizedversus primary cell cultures, mitochondrial density, or other factors. Nonetheless, taken together these data are consistent with a role for mitochondrial poly(ADP-ribosylation) in caspase-independent cell death.Whereas activation of PARP during times where cellular energy stores are limited is detrimental (2Eliasson M.J. Sampei K. Mandir A.S. Hurn P.D. Traystman R.J. Bao J. Pieper A. Wang Z.Q. Dawson T.M. Snyder S.H. Dawson V.L. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 1089-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar, 3Whalen M.J.

In addition to facilitating both genomic and mitochondrial DNA repair (11Druzhyna N. Smulson M.E. LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2644-2649Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), poly(ADP-ribosylation) also serves a regulatory role for many transcription factors including nuclear factor-κB, AP-1, and Stat-1 (42Ha H.C. Hester L.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3270-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), and also may regulate transcription itself via loosening chromatin (43Tulin A.

Baseline poly(ADP-ribosylation) within both nuclear and mitochondrial compartments as demonstrated in this study, support such homeostatic functions in cells. In neurons, poly(ADP-ribosylation) may also participate in long-term potentiation (44Schuman E.M. Meffert M.K. Schulman H. Madison D.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Neurochem.,. 2003; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). In dividing cells such as fibroblasts, poly(ADP-ribosylation) via PARP-2 regulates mitosis (47Smith S. Giriat I. Schmitt A. de Lange T. Science. 1998; 282: 1484-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). Collectively these data suggest that poly(ADP-ribosylation) compartmentalized to both mitochondria and nuclei can be converted from a homeostatic process to a mechanism of cell death when oxidative stress is accompanied by energy depletion.A direct role for mitochondrial poly(ADP-ribosylation) in cell death associated with loss of ΔΨm, mitochondrial dysfunction, and release of AIF is implicated. These data do not refute previous hypotheses suggesting that overactivation of nuclear PARP-1 consumes total cellular energy stores contributing to mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. However, these data do represent a paradigm shift, where poly(ADP-ribosylation) compartmentalized within the mitochondria contributes to AIF release and cell death in the face of cellular energy failure. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-11; EC 2.4.2.30), the most abundant poly(ADP-ribosyltransferase) in mammalian cells, plays an essential role in excitotoxic"

During liver growth, this process generates the appearance of tetraploid (4n) and octoploid (8n) hepatocytes with one or two nuclei. The onset of polyploidy in the liver has been recognized for quite some time; however, the cellular mechanisms that govern it remain unknown. In this report, we observed the sequential appearance during liver growth of binuclear diploid (2 × 2n) and mononuclear 4n hepatocytes from a diploid hepatocyte population. To identify the cell cycle modifications involved in hepatocyte polyploidization, mitosis was then monitored in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. Twenty percent of mononuclear 2n hepatocytes failed to undergo cytokinesis with no observable contractile movement of the ring. This process led to the formation of binuclear 2 × 2n hepatocytes. This tetraploid condition following cleavage failure did not activate the p53-dependent checkpoint in G1. In fact, binuclear hepatocytes were able to proceed through S phase, and the formation of a bipolar spindle during mitosis constituted the key step leading to the genesis of two mononuclear 4n hepatocytes. Finally, we studied the duplication and clustering of centrosomes in the binuclear hepatocyte. These cells exhibited two centrosomes in G1 that were duplicated during S phase and then clustered by pairs at opposite poles of the cell during metaphase.

Polyploidy is a general physiological process that prevails in many cellular systems including plants, insects, and mammals (1Ravid K. Lu J. Zimmet J.M. Jones M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The onset of cellular polyploidization is associated with late fetal development and postnatal maturation. Advanced polyploidy in mammalian cells is indicative of terminal differentiation and senescence (2Sigal S.H. Rajvanshi P. Gorla G.R. Sokhi R.P. Saxena R. Gebhard Jr., D.R. Reid L.M. Gupta S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G1260-G1272PubMed Google Scholar). Hepatocytes come under the former category. During growth, the liver parenchyma undergoes dramatic changes characterized by gradual polyploidization during which hepatocytes of several ploidy classes emerge as a result of modified cell division cycles. This process generates the successive appearance of tetraploid and octoploid cell classes with one or two nuclei. Thus, in the liver of a newborn rat, hepatocytes are exclusively diploid (2n), 1The abbreviations used are: 2n, diploid; 4n, tetraploid; 8n, octaploid; × 2n (or 2 × 4n), binuclear; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine.1The abbreviations used are: 2n, diploid; 4n, tetraploid; 8n, octaploid; × 2n (or 2 × 4n), binuclear; BrdUrd, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine. and polyploidization starts after weaning. In adult rats, about 10% of hepatocytes are diploid, 70% are tetraploid, and 20% octoploid. If we consider the polyploid fraction, 20–30% of hepatocytes are binuclear (either 2 × 2n or 2 × 4n) (3Nadal C. Zajdela F. Exp. Cell Res. 1967; 48: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 4Saeter G. Schwarze P.E. Nesland J.M. Juul N. Pettersen E.O. Seglen P.O. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The degree of polyploidization varies among mammals (5Wheatley D.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 74: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and particularly in humans, where the number of polyploid cells averages 20–30% in the adult liver (6Kudryavtsev B.N. Kudryavtseva M.V. Sakuta G.A. Stein G.I. Virchows Arch. B Cell Pathol. 1993; 64: 387-393Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 7Seglen P.O. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1997; 13: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in different liver pathologies, hepatocarcinoma for example, hepatocellular growth shifts to a nonpolyploidizing growth pattern, and expansion of the diploid hepatocyte population has been found to take place (4Saeter G. Schwarze P.E. Nesland J.M. Juul N. Pettersen E.O. Seglen P.O. Carcinogenesis. 1988; 9: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Seglen P.O. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1997; 13: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Polyploidization is a general strategy of cell growth that enables an increase in metabolic output, cell mass, and cell size, and may constitute an alternative to cell division (1Ravid K. Lu J. Zimmet J.M. Jones M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In addition, the status of ploidy is likely to affect the expression profile of specific genes, as has been described in a yeast system (8Galitski T. Saldanha A.J. Styles C.A. Lander E.S. Fink G.R. Science. 1999; 285: 251-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). The biological significance of hepatic polyploidy remains unclear. It has been suggested that the polyploid genome may provide protection against the dominant expression of mutated oncogenes, a safety measure that might be helpful for an organ heavily engaged in drug detoxification (9Schwarze P.E. Pettersen E.O. Shoaib M.C. Seglen P.O. Carcinogenesis. 1984; 5: 1267-1275Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The onset of polyploidy in the liver has been recognized for quite some time. However, the cellular mechanisms that govern the passage from mononuclear 2n to binuclear 2 × 2n and/or mononuclear 4n hepatocytes remain unknown. One possible explanation is that binuclear 2 × 2n hepatocytes may play a pivotal role in the genesis of mononuclear 4n hepatocytes. Hepatocyte binucleation results from either a defect in the cytokinesis of mononuclear 2n cells (3Nadal C. Zajdela F. Exp. Cell Res. 1967; 48: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Seglen P.O. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1997; 13: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or the fusion of two mononuclear 2n cells (10Gomez-Lechon M.J. Barbera E. Gil R. Baguena J. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1981; 27: 695-701Google Scholar). Thereafter, binuclear 2 × 2n hepatocytes may divide, leading to the genesis of two daughter mononuclear 4n hepatocytes. A mononuclear 4n hepatocyte then embarks upon a new round of binucleation/polyploidization with the formation of 2 × 4n and 8n cells. An alternative explanation for liver polyploidization is that a mononuclear 2n hepatocyte gives rise directly to mononuclear 4n cells through endoreplication. This process has already been described in plants, Drosophila, and mammals, notably in megakaryocyte and trophoblast cells, and results from uncoupling of the normal link between S phase and mitosis (1Ravid K. Lu J. Zimmet J.M. Jones M.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 190: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In murine models exhibiting an absence or deregulated expression of genes such as p21, S-phase kinase associated protein 2 (Skp2), and excision repair cross-complementing protein 1 (ERCC1), endoreplication induces premature liver polyploidization. In these mice, the liver has been characterized by an increase in the number of mononuclear polyploid fractions (11Wu H. Wade M. Krall L. Grisham J. Xiong J. Van Dyke T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 245-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 12Minamishima Y.A. Nakayama K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 995-999PubMed Google Scholar, 13Nunez F. Chipchase M.D. Clarke A.R. Melton D.W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to define the cellular mechanisms involved in liver polyploidization by studying the hepatocyte cell cycle. We demonstrated that the binuclear hepatocyte is central to the polyploidization process. Having characterized the in vivo kinetic of liver polyploidization, we showed that the abortion of cytokinesis induced the formation of binuclear hepatocytes. This tetraploid condition following cleavage failure did not activate the p53-dependent checkpoint in G1; binuclear cells could divide and generate two mononuclear 4n daughter cells. This event was driven by the clustering of two centrosomes at each pole of the cell, leading to the formation of a bipolar spindle. Animals—Male Wistar rats (Iffacredo, Lyon, France) were treated in accordance with European Union regulations on animal care. The rats were housed under standard light/dark conditions and received pelleted food and water ad libitum. All rats were weaned 17 days after birth (weaning and the commencement of feeding influence hepatic polyploidy) (5Wheatley D.N. Exp. Cell Res. 1972; 74: 455-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In Situ Detection of Ploidy—Liver tissues were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and then embedded in paraffin. Three-micrometer-thick tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and, after rehydration, boiled for 3× 5 min in 10 mmol/liter citrate buffer, pH 6.2, in a microwave oven. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described below. Plasma membranes were labeled with anti-β-catenin antibody (diluted 1:50, BD Transduction Laboratories). Hoechst 33342 (0.2 μg/ml) was used to stain and quantify DNA in each nucleus. Tissue sections were analyzed under a Zeiss (Axiovert 35) (Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany) inverted microscope equipped for epi-illumination. Zeiss Plan Neofluar 40× objectives (numerical aperture, 0.75) were chosen that enabled the collection of light from the entire thickness of the nucleus, these conditions being essential for adequate DNA content determinations. Images were captured using a cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, Arizona; KAF 1400-G2, class 2) on 4056 gray levels. Automatic quantitative image analysis was performed in 12 bits using IPLab Spectrum software. Nuclei were assigned as mono or binucleated hepatocytes by comparing fluorescent and membrane-labeling images. Other liver cell types (defined by their morphological characteristics), overlapping nuclei, or debris were eliminated interactively. Parameters such as integrated fluorescence intensity (IntF) were stored in computer files for analysis using the KaleidaGraph and Imastat software (Imastat as developed by P. Debey) (14Chassoux D. Franchi J. Cao T.T. Debey P. Anal. Quant. Cytol. Histol. 1999; 21: 489-497PubMed Google Scholar). A minimum of 300 hepatocytes were studied and observed on eight to twelve separate fields; these observations concerned specimens from four animals for each point analyzed. This number of hepatocytes was within the range covered by other imaging-based studies. Live Cell Videomicroscopy and Immunofluorescence Microscopy on Primary Rat Hepatocytes—Primary rat hepatocytes were isolated by liver perfusion with a collagenase blend (Liberase, Roche Applied Science). After isolation, cells were collected in William's medium E enriched with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and left to sediment for 20 min. After three centrifugations (65 × g for 1 min), hepatocytes were seeded at 5 × 105 cells/cm2 on plastic dishes in William's medium E, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 5 μg/ml bovine insulin in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 atmosphere. All culture medium used contained penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and fungizone (250 ng/ml). Hepatocyte viability was assessed to be >90% using trypan blue dye exclusion. After cell attachment (4 h later), the medium was removed and replaced by fresh serum-free William's medium E containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 μg/ml bovine insulin, and 7 10–7m hydrocortisone hemisuccinate. The medium was changed every day thereafter. Twenty-four h after plating, the cells were placed in the mitogenic stimulation medium, i.e. the same medium describe above supplemented with epidermal growth factor (EGF) at 50 ng/ml and pyruvate at 20 mm (mitogenic stimulation medium). This medium was used throughout the culture time. Under these conditions, maximal DNA synthesis occurs from 48–60 h, depending on the cell culture (15McIntyre M. Desdouets C. Senamaud-Beaufort C. Laurent-Winter C. Lamas E. Brechot C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4577-4585Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For live cell microscopy, hepatocytes were grown on 35 × 10-mm tissue culture plates and mounted on the microscope after 48 h of culture. During imaging, hepatocytes were maintained in William's medium E on a stage heated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were imaged at 3 min intervals for 24 h with a Leica DMIRBE using a 63× lens (numerical aperture, 0.7), a condenser (working distance, 23 mm; numerical aperture, 0.53), and a Pentamax cooled CCD camera (Popper Scientific) coupled to an electronic shutter. Metamorph 4.6 was used for computer-based image acquisition and analysis of live cell data. The single images shown were prepared using Adobe Photoshop® 5.5. For immunofluorescence microscopy, hepatocytes were grown on chambered coverslips and fixed with methanol at –20 °C for 10 min. The coverslips were then washed and blocked with the Biotin blocking system (Dako). Incubations with primary mouse antibodies (anti-γ–tubulin (1:200, GTU88, Sigma), anti-β-tubulin (1:200, TUB2.1, Sigma), and anti-p53 (1:100, FL-393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) were carried out for 1 h at room temperature. For the detection of primary antibodies, biotinylated swine anti-mouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin solutions were used (1:200, Dako) followed by FITC-conjugated streptavidin (1:200, DAKO). Hoechst 33342 (0.2 μg/ml) was included in the final incubation to stain DNA. Western Blot Analyzes—Hepatocyte protein extracts were prepared in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad); 30 μg of protein were fractionated on SDS-PAGE and then transferred to Hybond C membrane (Amersham Biosciences). p53, cyclin E, and β-tubulin proteins were detected using specific antisera (FL-393 against p53 and M20 against cyclin E with incubation overnight at 4 °C; both antisera were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was used as second antibody (dilution 1:2000, incubation for 1 h at room temperature). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BRD) Labeling—The percentage of cells undergoing DNA synthesis was estimated by counting the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells using the BrdUrd detection kit II (Roche Applied Science). Cells were incubated with BrdUrd labeling medium for 12 h. The medium was then removed and the cells were fixed in ethanol/acetic acid (70:30) and stained according to manufacturer's instructions. Ten separate fields were counted per plate, and averages were representative of three independent experiments. Kinetics of Polyploidization during Liver Growth—Although several studies have described changes in ploidy at various stages of liver development, none has established the in vivo emergence of tetraploid hepatocytes (binuclear 2 × 2n or mononuclear 4n cells). For this purpose, we used an approach based on quantitative fluorescence imaging (14Chassoux D. Franchi J. Cao T.T. Debey P. Anal. Quant. Cytol. Histol. 1999; 21: 489-497PubMed Google Scholar). The simultaneous nuclear and plasma membrane labeling of liver tissue sections made it possible to determine the number of nuclei per cell (Fig. 1A) and thus calculate the binuclear hepatocyte fraction (Fig. 1C). The use of a stoichiometric DNA labeling agent, Hoechst 33342, enabled determination of the DNA content in all cells by measuring the integrated fluorescence emitted by each nucleus. A typical histogram of integrated fluorescence values for mononuclear cells is shown in Fig. 1B. Because of the clear bimodal distribution around two main values separated by a factor of 2, the distribution of 2n and 4n mononuclear hepatocytes was assessed with accuracy even in a small number of nuclei. Using this technique, we examined the hepatic ploidy status of 12–39-day-old rats. The relative proportions of different hepatocyte ploidy classes during liver development are shown in Fig. 1C. We found that hepatocytes were mostly diploid in the livers of young rats (99% at day 12). From day 22 the proportion of diploid cells started to fall significantly, with the successive appearance of binuclear 2 × 2n and mononuclear 4n hepatocytes. Binuclear 2 × 2n cells were first detected at day 22 (4.6% of hepatocytes), and then their proportion rose rapidly between days 25 and 30 to reach 27.5% of the total hepatocyte population (Fig. 1C). The relative proportion of the binuclear population decreased gradually and comprised only 2 × 2n DNA content until at least day 39 (data not shown). The mononuclear 4n hepatocyte population was only present at significant levels 25 days after birth and represented 5.2% of the total hepatocyte population. Up to day 25, the fraction of nuclei with a 4n DNA content represented only cycling mononuclear 2n cells in G2, as determined by the percentage of replicating nuclei in control rats injected with BrdUrd (data not shown and Ref. 16Sigal S.H. Gupta S. Gebhard Jr., D.F. Holst P. Neufeld D. Reid L.M. Differentiation. 1995; 59: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). These cells were not present at significant levels after 25 days. At day 30, a sharp increase was observed in the number of mononuclear 4n hepatocytes (10.9% of the total population), and this hepatocyte population was in the majority at day 39, reaching 44.4% of the total population (Fig. 1C). These results clearly demonstrated in vivo that binuclear 2 × 2n and mononuclear 4n hepatocytes appear successively during liver growth. Genesis of Binuclear Hepatocytes and Abortion of Cytokinesis—To define the genesis of binuclear hepatocytes, we monitored the division of hepatocytes isolated from 24-day-old rats corresponding to the moment of appearance of these cells in vivo. After 48 h of culture, mononuclear 2n hepatocytes were observed for 24 h to visualize their passage through mitosis; during this period, 60% of mononuclear 2n hepatocytes were in S phase or had already proceeded through this phase (BrdUrd labeling, data not shown). At least 50 mononuclear 2n hepatocytes were inspected during four independent experiments, and no morphological evidence of cell apoptosis was observed at any time during the study. In 80% of the mononuclear 2n hepatocytes analyzed division was normal (example on Fig. 2A and on Video 1), the cell initiated prophase, and the chromosome then lined up along the metaphase plate (Fig. 2A, panel 2). Cells then pinched off in the middle during telophase/cytokinesis (Fig. 2A, panel 3). Once mitosis was complete, the resulting two daughter mononuclear 2n hepatocytes became individualized (Fig. 2A, panel 4). In contrast, 20% of the mononuclear 2n cells observed exited from mitosis inappropriately (example on Fig. 2B and on Video 2). The initial steps (prophase, metaphase, and anaphase) took place as expected, but during telophase, cytokinesis aborted. The cells established an acto-myosin ring-like structure (Fig. 2B, panel 3) but no contractile movement could be seen. Ultimately, disappearance of the ring led to the formation of a binuclear hepatocyte (Fig. 2B, panel 4). The average length of mitosis was similar during the two types of division (61 ± 5 min; from three independent experiments). In particular, the duration of telophase was not reduced by the abortion of cytokinesis. We conclude, therefore, that acytokinesis is the basis of hepatocyte binucleation. Binuclear Hepatocyte Is a Pivotal Cell for the Genesis of Tetraploid Hepatocytes—We then determined whether binuclear hepatocytes could proceed through a complete subsequent cell cycle. In fact, under certain experimental conditions recent results have demonstrated the existence of a p53-dependent checkpoint control acting in G1 to recognize tetraploid cells and induce their arrest (17Andreassen P.R. Lohez O.D. Lacroix F.B. Margolis R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1315-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 18Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 19Borel F. Lohez O.D. Lacroix F.B. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9819-9824Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we first analyzed whether binuclear hepatocytes were able to progress through S phase. We performed BrdUrd labeling on hepatocytes isolated from 28 days-old male rats (the maximum level of binuclear cells is found in the liver at this age). Analysis of BrdUrd incorporation revealed that DNA replication occurred in binuclear as well as mononuclear hepatocytes (Fig. 3A); maximum labeling (35%) was observed between 48 and 60 h of culture, which corresponds to the peak of S phase for the mononuclear 2n fraction. We next determined whether the absence of the p53-dependent checkpoint could explain the cell cycle progression of binuclear cells. We monitored the level of p53 by Western blot and immunofluorescence on primary hepatocyte cultures (28 day-old male rats) (Fig. 3, B and C). We did not observe any significant changes to the expression of p53 at different times during culture compared with the increasing expression of cyclin E (Fig. 3B). Moreover, p53 was expressed in both mononuclear 2n and binuclear 2 × 2n hepatocytes with a predominant nuclear localization. (Fig. 3C, 48 and 60 h of culture, panels 1, 2, 4, and 5). Furthermore, we observed the same p53 pattern in hepatocytes isolated from 12 day-old male rats (Fig. 3C, 48 h of culture, panels 3 and 6). Taken together, these results indicate that p53 was expressed in hepatocytes of different ploidy classes; moreover, its expression did not prevent the cell cycle progression of binuclear hepatocytes. Thereafter, we monitored the mitosis of binuclear cells using time-lapse videomicroscopy. After 48 h of culture in four different experiments, 20 binuclear cells were analyzed for up to 24 h. We observed that all of the binuclear cells monitored proceeded identically through mitosis. An example is shown in Fig. 4 and on Video 3. We observed that both nuclei of the binuclear hepatocyte entered mitosis simultaneously. The key step occurred during metaphase; a bipolar spindle was formed, leading to the alignment of all chromosomes along the same plate (Fig. 4, panel 2). Thereafter, during anaphase sister chromatids separated and migrated toward the two opposing poles as expected (Fig. 4, panel 3). Cytokinesis occurred correctly at the end of telophase (Fig. 4, panel 4). Ultimately, this gave rise to two mononuclear 4n daughter hepatocytes (Fig. 4, panels 5 and 6). Taken together, these experiments show that binuclear hepatocyte is the pivotal cell giving rise to mononuclear 4n progeny. Centrosome Traffic during the Division of Binuclear Hepatocytes—To explain the formation of a unique bipolar spindle during the division of binuclear hepatocytes, we studied centrosome duplication and separation in these cells. During the G1 phase, in a diploid mammalian cell the centrosome comprises a pair of centrioles connected via a proteinaceous linkage (20Lange B.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The centrosome is duplicated during S phase when a procentriole buds from each parental centriole. During prophase, the centriolar linkage is disrupted, and the two centrosomes separate and migrate apart to form the bipolar spindle. During our study, we scored the number of centrosomes at different stages of the cell cycle to characterize bipolar spindle formation in binuclear hepatocytes. Using immunofluorescence analysis on primary cell cultures, we showed that a binuclear hepatocyte displayed two centrosomes during G1 phase (2n DNA content per nucleus) and four centrosomes during G2 phase (4n DNA content per nucleus) (Fig. 5A). Thus a binuclear hepatocyte inherited two parental centrosomes from mononuclear 2n cells, which duplicated. We then studied their movement during mitosis. The nuclei entered prophase simultaneously (Fig. 5B). At this point, the four centrosomes moved apart and, at metaphase, clustered in pairs at opposite poles of the cell (Fig. 5B). During telophase, centrosome clustering was maintained (Fig. 5B). Finally, leaving mitosis, the two daughter mononuclear 4n cells will inherit two centrosomes from the binuclear 2 × 2n hepatocyte. This phenomenon was always observed. At last, we determined whether each centrosome was capable of nucleating microtubules. During prophase, the four centrosomes of binuclear hepatocytes nucleated microtubule asters like the two centrosomes of a mononuclear cell (Fig. 5C) and therefore participated in the formation of the bipolar spindle. We were therefore able to demonstrate that, in the binuclear hepatocyte, centrosome clustering appeared to constitute a key event during formation of the bipolar spindle, giving rise solely to mononuclear 4n progeny. In this report, we demonstrate that liver cell polyploidization is an original physiological process passing through a binucleation step. A proportion of mononucleated 2n hepatocytes aborted cytokinesis and thus generated a binuclear hepatocyte 2 × 2n. This binuclear cell was able to pass through a new cell cycle and subsequently divide into two mononuclear 4n cells. Moreover, we showed that the clustering of centrosomes during mitosis was a key step in the genesis of mononuclear 4n hepatocytes. First of all, we were interested in characterizing changes to hepatocyte polyploidization during liver growth in vivo. In fact, only ex vivo studies utilizing methods such as karyometry (3Nadal C. Zajdela F. Exp. Cell Res. 1967; 48: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), cytophotometry (21Yin L. Ghebranious N. Chakraborty S. Sheehan C.E. Ilic Z. Sell S. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), flow cytometry (22Mossin L. Blankson H. Huitfeldt H. Seglen P.O. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and fluorescence microscopy (23Martin N.C. McCullough C.T. Bush P.G. Sharp L. Hall A.C. Harrison D.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 2002; 191: 138-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) have so far described this phenomenon after cell isolation and purification. In this study, we developed a method that accurately distinguished mononuclear and binuclear cells and measured the DNA content of each nucleus in tissue sections. Our methodology provides the first direct assessment of hepatocyte ploidy status during liver growth and, interestingly, the results of previous ex vivo studies were in line with ours. We demonstrated in vivo during post-natal development that the liver is almost solely made up of diploid hepatocytes for the first 22 days; thereafter, between the ages of 22 and 28 days the decline of this population is strictly correlated with the appearance of the binuclear population. These results strongly suggest that the mononuclear 2n hepatocyte is the precursor of the binuclear hepatocyte. Moreover, we observed that the mononuclear 4n population appeared 30 days after birth, by which stage the binuclear population was slowly declining. These observations suggest that a binuclear status may constitute an intermediate step prior to the generation of mononuclear 4n hepatocytes. To analyze more precisely the cellular mechanisms involved in hepatocyte polyploidization, we followed the division of cells during primary culture. We directly demonstrated that mononuclear 2n hepatocytes were the precursors of binuclear 2 × 2n cells using time-lapse videomicroscopy. We showed that 20% of mononuclear 2n hepatocytes abort cytokinesis; no movement of the contractile ring was observed, and its disappearance led to the genesis of a binuclear cell. This report therefore provides the first direct evidence that acytokinesis forms the basis for hepatocyte binucleation. Previous studies (based on other cell types) had described the binucleation processes as a result of exit from mitosis because of either the absence or abortion of cytokinesis (18Meraldi P. Honda R.

Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Our study offers an experimental model to investigate whether one or several of these proteins are also involved in the physiological hepatocyte binucleation process. In this context, it is interesting to note that a recent study suggested that citron kinase is not implicated in the binucleation process during post-natal liver development (34Liu H. Di Cunto F. Imarisio S. Reid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2541-2548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that binuclear hepatocytes divide into two mononuclear 4n hepatocytes. Binuclear hepatocytes were able to progress through S phase in primary culture, and this observation was not due to the culture conditions, since binuclear hepatocytes were also BrdUrd-labeled in vivo during liver growth (data not shown). Intriguingly, recent studies in other cell types (for example HeLa cells and embryo fibroblasts) have shown that tetraploidy, induced by an inappropriate exit of cells from mitosis following the failure of spindle assembly, chromosome segregation, or cytokinesis, causes all cells to arrest in G1 (17Andreassen P.R. Lohez O.D. Lacroix F.B. Margolis R.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 1315-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 18Meraldi P. Honda R. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 483-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). In that model, the function of the p53 protein was required to impose G1 arrest in response to tetraploidization. Its inactivation caused a failure to arrest at this G1 checkpoint, and tetraploid cells then rapidly progressed to aneuploidy. In these cells, amplified numbers of centrosomes and their abnormal clustering led to the formation of multipolar mitotic spindles (19Borel F. Lohez O.D. Lacroix F.B. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9819-9824Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Contrastingly, in our experimental system p53 was expressed in all binuclear and mononuclear hepatocytes. Thus, our observations demonstrate that G1 checkpoint control by p53 is not activated by physiological acytokinesis in hepatocytes. Three studies in p53-deficient mice have addressed the implication of p53 in hepatocyte ploidization (13Nunez F. Chipchase M.D. Clarke A.R. Melton D.W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Yin L. Ghebranious N. Chakraborty S. Sheehan C.E. Ilic Z. Sell S. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 35Bellamy C.O. Clarke A.R. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Although discrepant results were obtained in one of these studies, the other two showed that the p53 genotype (p53+/+, p53±, p53–/–) did not influence hepatocyte polyploidization (13Nunez F. Chipchase M.D. Clarke A.R. Melton D.W. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1073-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 35Bellamy C.O. Clarke A.R. Wyllie A.H. Harrison D.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Our study therefore provides direct support for this hypothesis. It will be interesting in the future to search for other potential checkpoints, including (in particular) the retinoblastoma (Rb) pocket protein family (19Borel F. Lohez O.D. Lacroix F.B. Margolis R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9819-9824Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Following the mitosis of binuclear hepatocytes, we established that 100% of these cells formed a bipolar spindle, leading to the alignment of all chromosomes on one metaphase plate, a prerequisite for correct chromosome segregation, thus ensuring the tetraploidy status of progeny cells. Interestingly, we found that the two centrosomes of a G1 binuclear hepatocyte duplicated during S phase and then associated in pairs at metaphase at the two opposite poles of the cell. Formation of the bipolar spindle with two active centrosomes at each pole may be necessary to ensure spindle stability and correct segregation of the 8n DNA content. How the centrosomes migrate in pairs to the two opposite poles of the cell is still to be determined. In diploid cells, at G2/M transition the dynamic structure linking parental centrioles is disrupted, and the two centrosomes then move apart to form the mitotic spindle (36Mayor T. Stierhof Y.D. Tanaka K. Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 837-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In binuclear hepatocytes, the lack of disruption to this structure may prevent separation of the pair of centrosomes and lead to their specific positioning at the two poles of the cell in metaphase. In conclusion, the hepatocyte constitutes a particularly interesting model of a ploidy process leading first to binuclear cells, which then evolve into mononuclear tetraploid cells. Further work will make it possible to decode the molecular mechanisms controlling hepatocyte tetraploidization and the prevention of aneuploidy. We thank F. Demaugre, D. Kremsdorf, and N.

Here we describe haploChIP, a method that uses chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and mass spectrometry to identify differential protein–DNA binding in vivo associated with allelic variants of a gene. We demonstrate this approach with the imprinted gene SNRPN. HaploChIP showed close correlation between the level of bound phosphorylated RNA polymerase II at the SNRPN locus and allele-specific expression. Application of the approach to the TNF/LTA locus identified functionally important haplotypes that correlate with allele-specific transcription of LTA.

https://openalex.org/W2129889192,"Na(+)-activated potassium channels (K(Na)) have been identified in cardiomyocytes and neurons where they may provide protection against ischemia. We now report that K(Na) is encoded by the rSlo2 gene (also called Slack), the mammalian ortholog of slo-2 in C. elegans. rSlo2, heterologously expressed, shares many properties of native K(Na) including activation by intracellular Na(+), high conductance, and prominent subconductance states. In addition to activation by Na(+), we report that rSLO-2 channels are cooperatively activated by intracellular Cl(-), similar to C. elegans SLO-2 channels. Since intracellular Na(+) and Cl(-) both rise in oxygen-deprived cells, coactivation may more effectively trigger the activity of rSLO-2 channels in ischemia. In C. elegans, mutational and physiological analysis revealed that the SLO-2 current is a major component of the delayed rectifier. We demonstrate in C. elegans that slo-2 mutants are hypersensitive to hypoxia, suggesting a conserved role for the slo-2 gene subfamily."

It has recently been found that the mouse Polycomb group (PcG) gene Eed (embryonic ectoderm development) acts to maintain repression of the imprinted X chromosome. Here, we investigated whether Eed is also required for regulation of autosomal imprinted loci. Expression analyses showed that transcripts from the silent alleles of a subset of paternally repressed genes were present in Eed(-/-) embryos. Parent-of-origin methylation was preserved in these embryos, but we observed changes in the methylation status of specific CpGs in differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at affected but not at unaffected loci.

Three modes of autophagy have been identified: chaperone-mediated autophagy, microautophagy, and macroautophagy. In chaperone-mediated autophagy, specific proteins containing targeting sequences are bound by chaperones that mediate direct transport across the lysosomal membrane (1Dice J.F. Terlecky S.R.

A lysosomal receptor, lysosomal-associated membrane protein type 2a, interacts with the substrate to facilitate transport into the lysosome (2Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 25-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and involves vacuolar membrane invagination to capture cargo directly. Macroautophagy is a non-selective mechanism used to deliver cytoplasmic components, including entire organelles, to the lysosome or vacuole during starvation (reviewed in Ref. 6Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Initially, a membrane distinct from the vacuole/lysosome encloses a portion of cytoplasm to form a double-membraned vesicle called an autophagosome or autophagic vacuole. The autophagosome docks at and fuses with the vacuole/lysosome, releasing a single-membraned vesicle called an autophagic body, which is degraded by resident hydrolases.

Starvation releases the repression of autophagy by the target of rapamycin (Tor)1 protein kinase, leading to the activation of another serine/threonine kinase, Apg1p, which activates autophagy through unknown downstream targets (15Kamada Y. Funakoshi T. Shintani T. Nagano K. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 1507-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (898) Google Scholar). Apg1p kinase activity is regulated by the phosphorylation status of a binding partner, Apg13; hyperphosphorylated Apg13p associates weakly with Apg1p. Upon Tor inactivation, Apg13p is dephosphorylated and binds more tightly to and activates Apg1p.Autophagosome formation also requires the activity of two protein conjugation systems mechanistically related to ubiquitination. In the first, the carboxyl-terminal glycine of Apg12p is conjugated to an internal lysine of Apg5p, through the action of E1-like and E2-like enzymes, Apg7p and Apg10p, respectively (16Shintani T.

A second conjugation system involves the conjugation of Apg8p/Aut7p to the membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (14Ichimura Y. Kirisako T. Takao T. Satomi Y. Shimonishi Y. Ishihara N. Mizushima N.

Apg8p/Aut7p is the only component of the autophagy machinery in yeast that is transcriptionally up-regulated upon starvation (23Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar).Dictyostelium discoideum is a soil amoeba that feeds on bacteria but upon starvation completes a complex developmental cycle to produce a multicellular organism (reviewed in Ref. 24Kessin R.H. Dictyostelium-Evolution, Cell Biology, and the Development of Multicellularity. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom2001Crossref Google Scholar). Starving amoebae aggregate using a cyclic AMP signaling relay to form mounds of about 100,000 cells. The mound undergoes morphogenesis to produce a mature fruiting body composed of a sphere of spores held aloft a cellular stalk. To complete development and construct a fruiting body,Dictyostelium needs to mobilize resources allotted previously to growth. We reasoned therefore that autophagy would be important for Dictyostelium development. Additionally, given its genetic tractability, we believe that Dictyostelium is a good organism to extend the observations on autophagy made in budding yeast, plants, and mammalian cells and to ask questions about the control of autophagy during development. We find that apg5and apg7 are essential for Dictyosteliumdevelopment. Mutants disrupted in these genes do not aggregate on agar plates cleared of Klebsiella pneumoniae, as the wild-type parents do, but will aggregate if starved on nitrocellulose filters or non-nutrient agar. The autophagy mutants have no evident growth defects but die rapidly when starved of amino acids. Protein turnover, which is normally induced by starvation, is reduced inapg5− and apg7−. GFP fusions of Apg5 and Apg12 are present in two forms in growing and starving cells, corresponding to free and conjugated forms, implying similar conjugation reactions to those discovered in budding yeast. We also examine the subcellular localization of a GFP fusion of Apg8 inDictyostelium and show the effects of autophagy on the ultrastructural organization of cells during starvation.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we show that the autophagy pathway characterized in yeast, plants, and mammalian cells is conserved in D. discoideum. We identified putative Dictyosteliumorthologues of S. cerevisiae proteins for Apg1–9, Apg12, and Tor. We were unable to locate orthologues of Apg10, Apg13, Apg16, or Apg17, either because they do not exist in social amoebae, are poorly conserved in evolution, or because we searched an incompletely sequenced genome. Unlike A. thaliana, we find only a single isoform of each protein with the exception of Apg4. We examined the expression of some of the identified autophagy genes inDictyostelium and observe up-regulated transcription ofapg1, apg8, and apg9 when cells are starved (Fig. 2). In yeast, the expression of only one autophagy gene,APG8, is significantly induced by starvation (23Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar).To analyze the functional conservation of macroautophagy, we generated and characterized the first autophagy mutants described in D. discoideum, in the apg5 and apg7 genes. Apg5 is the target of Apg12 conjugation, requiring the activity of the E1-like enzyme, Apg7. This conjugation reaction is chemically similar to ubiquitination and is required for the formation of autophagosomes (13Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 42Mizushima N. Sugita H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33889-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Both Dictyostelium genes show significant homology with their budding yeast, plant, and mammalian counterparts (Fig. 1), with all residues known to be essential for function conserved. In addition, the Apg12-Apg5 conjugation system appears to be present inDictyostelium (Fig. 7). Two forms of the GFP fusion proteins are detected in wild-type cells, but the higher molecular mass form of Apg5-GFP is absent in apg7−, and the conjugated form of GFP-Apg12 is absent in both apg5− andapg7−. This conjugation pattern is consistent with the functions assigned to Apg5, Apg7, and Apg12 from studies in budding yeast and mammalian cells. Apg5-GFP and GFP-Apg12 show diffuse cytoplasmic localization and rarely a single dot in growing and starving cells (data not shown). The GFP-Apg8 fusion shows a change in localization pattern dependent on the nutritional status and genetic background of the cell. In the wild-type strain, GFP-Apg8 localizes to many punctate spots in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, B andD), in addition to diffuse cytoplasmic localization. Interestingly, the frequency of the dots is lowest in rich growth medium, HL5 (data not shown), and is higher in the defined medium, FM, and in phosphate buffer (SorC). These punctate structures may represent preautophagosomal complex(es) and/or forming/complete autophagosomes. In the apg5− and apg7−mutants, GFP-Apg8 labels only a single punctate structure that is much larger than the dots observed in the wild-type strain (Fig. 7,F, H, J, and L), and the localization/frequency of these structures does not change when cells are starved. It is unclear what these large structures represent, but immunoelectron microscopy with anti-GFP antibodies in GFP-Apg8-expressing strains may be informative.We find that apg5 and apg7 are dispensable for growth in Dictyostelium but are required for normal development. When apg5− andapg7− mutants develop, they form large multi-tipped aggregates that fail to complete normal morphogenesis. Instead, aberrant fruiting bodies composed of thickened stalks and empty sori are formed (Fig. 3). These structures produce no viable, mature spores. Additionally, development and spore production cannot be rescued by co-developing autophagy mutant cells with wild-type cells in a chimeric organism (Fig. 4). Thus, these autophagy mutations are cell autonomous. It is not clear how these mutations prohibit proper development, but it may include interference with chemotaxis, motility, adhesion, intercellular signaling, or differentiation.The apg5− and apg7−mutants exhibit additional attributes of autophagy mutants. Survival in medium lacking amino acids is severely reduced (Fig. 5), similar to that described for yeast and plants. Yeast autophagy mutants die rapidly when starved of amino acids, and plants carrying autophagy mutations are susceptible to nutrient limitation. Autophagy is the major mechanism of bulk protein turnover when yeast cells are starved for nitrogen, accounting for 80% of protein turnover (22Schlumpberger M. Schaeffeler E. Straub M. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1068-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We find that starved Dictyostelium autophagy mutants degrade very little protein (10–15%), whereas starved wild-type cells and complemented autophagy mutants degrade 30–40% of the protein they contained at the end of growth (Fig. 6). A mutation in yakA, a gene that is required for the growth to development transition inDictyostelium (40Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar), does not affect the reduction in protein levels typical of starved cells, indicating that the earliest events in development are not required for the induction of autophagy-dependent proteolysis. We see a similar result when starvation-induced protein turnover is assayed in an adenylyl cyclase mutant (aca−) (data not shown). Theaca− mutant also survives as well as wild-type when starved for amino acids (data not shown), confirming that autophagy can be induced even in the absence of early developmental events that are usually triggered by starvation.Consistent with the protein turnover defect inapg5− and apg7−, we observe by transmission electron microscopy that turnover of organelles and cytoplasmic constituents in cells starved for amino acids for 36 h is impaired (Fig. 9). Wild-type cells show significant degradation of the cytoplasm, to such an extent that portions of the cytoplasm are electron-lucent. Additionally, large vesicles are observed that contain a small amount of membrane and granular material that appears highly degraded. Conversely, in the starved mutant cells, vesicles containing membrane whorls and cytoplasm with little evidence of degradation are observed. These enclosed membrane whorls are reminiscent of autophagosomes or autophagic vacuoles in mammalian cells (43Papadopoulos T. Pfeifer U. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 171: 110-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 44Niemann A. Takatsuki A. Elsasser H.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The morphology of the autophagic system inDictyostelium appears more similar to mammalian cells than to budding yeast and may reflect the more complex intracellular membrane structure and dynamics of Dictyostelium compared with yeast. In the latter, the autophagosome fuses with the vacuole, releasing the autophagic body into the vacuolar lumen for degradation by resident hydrolases. In contrast, in mammalian cells, primary autophagosomes appear to mature to autophagic vacuoles through incorporation of lysosomal membrane proteins, vacuole acidification, and acquisition of lysosomal hydrolases (45Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Additional transmission electron microscopy studies are under way to better characterize the morphology of autophagy inDictyostelium and the specific defect we observe in the autophagy mutants.The underlying machinery used to generate autophagosomes is conserved among yeast, plants, humans, and now Dictyostelium. Genetic and cell biology studies in yeast have delineated the molecular framework required for autophagy. The challenge for the future is to elucidate the signaling pathways required to initiate autophagy, the mechanistic details of autophagosome formation, and the interaction of autophagy and endolysosomal pathways. Dictyostelium provides a useful system for these studies; it is genetically tractable, the endolysosomal system is similar to mammalian cells, and, most importantly, the effects of autophagy on multicellular development can be examined fruitfully. Protein turnover in eukaryotes is accomplished by two major mechanisms, autophagy or proteasomal degradation. Three modes of autophagy have been identified: chaperone-mediated autophagy, microautophagy, and macroautophagy. In chaperone-mediated autophagy, specific proteins containing targeting sequences are bound by chaperones that mediate direct transport across the lysosomal membrane (1Dice J.F. Terlecky S.R. Chiang H.L. Olson T.S. Isenman L.D. Short-Russell S.R. Freundlieb S. Terlecky L.J. Semin. Cell Biol. 1990; 1: 449-455PubMed Google Scholar). A lysosomal receptor, lysosomal-associated membrane protein type 2a, interacts with the substrate to facilitate transport into the lysosome (2Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. Traffic. 2000; 1: 570-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 3Cuervo A.M. Dice J.F. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4441-4450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microautophagy is required for basal protein degradation in rat liver (4Mortimore G.E. Lardeux B.R. Adams C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2506-2512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or glucose-induced peroxisome degradation in the methylotropic yeast Pichia pastoris (5Tuttle D.L. Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 25-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and involves vacuolar membrane invagination to capture cargo directly. Macroautophagy is a non-selective mechanism used to deliver cytoplasmic components, including entire organelles, to the lysosome or vacuole during starvation (reviewed in Ref. 6Reggiori F. Klionsky D.J. Eukaryot. Cell. 2002; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Initially, a membrane distinct from the vacuole/lysosome encloses a portion of cytoplasm to form a double-membraned vesicle called an autophagosome or autophagic vacuole. The autophagosome docks at and fuses with the vacuole/lysosome, releasing a single-membraned vesicle called an autophagic body, which is degraded by resident hydrolases. Molecular genetic analysis in the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has identified many of the genes that are required for autophagy (7Tsukada M. Ohsumi Y. FEBS Lett. 1993; 333: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (1377) Google Scholar, 8Thumm M. Egner R. Koch B. Schlumpberger M. Straub M. Veenhuis M. Wolf D.H.

The morphology of the autophagic system inDictyostelium appears more similar to mammalian cells than to budding yeast and may reflect the more complex intracellular membrane structure and dynamics of Dictyostelium compared with yeast. In the latter, the autophagosome fuses with the vacuole, releasing the autophagic body into the vacuolar lumen for degradation by resident hydrolases. In contrast, in mammalian cells, primary autophagosomes appear to mature to autophagic vacuoles through incorporation of lysosomal membrane proteins, vacuole acidification, and acquisition of lysosomal hydrolases (45Dunn Jr., W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Additional transmission electron microscopy studies are under way to better characterize the morphology of autophagy inDictyostelium and the specific defect we observe in the autophagy mutants.The underlying machinery used to generate autophagosomes is conserved among yeast, plants, humans, and now Dictyostelium. Genetic and cell biology studies in yeast have delineated the molecular framework required for autophagy. The challenge for the future is to elucidate the signaling pathways required to initiate autophagy, the mechanistic details of autophagosome formation, and the interaction of autophagy and endolysosomal pathways. Dictyostelium provides a useful system for these studies; it is genetically tractable, the endolysosomal system is similar to mammalian cells, and, most importantly, the effects of autophagy on multicellular development can be examined fruitfully. In this study, we show that the autophagy pathway characterized in yeast, plants, and mammalian cells is conserved in D. discoideum. We identified putative Dictyosteliumorthologues of S. cerevisiae proteins for Apg1–9, Apg12, and Tor. We were unable to locate orthologues of Apg10, Apg13, Apg16, or Apg17, either because they do not exist in social amoebae, are poorly conserved in evolution, or because we searched an incompletely sequenced genome. Unlike A. thaliana, we find only a single isoform of each protein with the exception of Apg4. We examined the expression of some of the identified autophagy genes inDictyostelium and observe up-regulated transcription ofapg1, apg8, and apg9 when cells are starved (Fig. 2). In yeast, the expression of only one autophagy gene,APG8, is significantly induced by starvation (23Kirisako T. Baba M. Ishihara N. Miyazawa K. Ohsumi M. Yoshimori T. Noda T. Ohsumi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 435-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). To analyze the functional conservation of macroautophagy, we generated and characterized the first autophagy mutants described in D. discoideum, in the apg5 and apg7 genes. Apg5 is the target of Apg12 conjugation, requiring the activity of the E1-like enzyme, Apg7. This conjugation reaction is chemically similar to ubiquitination and is required for the formation of autophagosomes (13Mizushima N. Noda T. Yoshimori T. Tanaka Y. Ishii T. George M.D. Klionsky D.J. Ohsumi M. Ohsumi Y. Nature. 1998; 395: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar, 42Mizushima N. Sugita H. Yoshimori T. Ohsumi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33889-33892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). Both Dictyostelium genes show significant homology with their budding yeast, plant, and mammalian counterparts (Fig. 1), with all residues known to be essential for function conserved. In addition, the Apg12-Apg5 conjugation system appears to be present inDictyostelium (Fig. 7). Two forms of the GFP fusion proteins are detected in wild-type cells, but the higher molecular mass form of Apg5-GFP is absent in apg7−, and the conjugated form of GFP-Apg12 is absent in both apg5− andapg7−. This conjugation pattern is consistent with the functions assigned to Apg5, Apg7, and Apg12 from studies in budding yeast and mammalian cells. Apg5-GFP and GFP-Apg12 show diffuse cytoplasmic localization and rarely a single dot in growing and starving cells (data not shown). The GFP-Apg8 fusion shows a change in localization pattern dependent on the nutritional status and genetic background of the cell. In the wild-type strain, GFP-Apg8 localizes to many punctate spots in the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, B andD), in addition to diffuse cytoplasmic localization. Interestingly, the frequency of the dots is lowest in rich growth medium, HL5 (data not shown), and is higher in the defined medium, FM, and in phosphate buffer (SorC). These punctate structures may represent preautophagosomal complex(es) and/or forming/complete autophagosomes. In the apg5− and apg7−mutants, GFP-Apg8 labels only a single punctate structure that is much larger than the dots observed in the wild-type strain (Fig. 7,F, H, J, and L), and the localization/frequency of these structures does not change when cells are starved. It is unclear what these large structures represent, but immunoelectron microscopy with anti-GFP antibodies in GFP-Apg8-expressing strains may be informative. We find that apg5 and apg7 are dispensable for growth in Dictyostelium but are required for normal development. When apg5− andapg7− mutants develop, they form large multi-tipped aggregates that fail to complete normal morphogenesis. Instead, aberrant fruiting bodies composed of thickened stalks and empty sori are formed (Fig. 3). These structures produce no viable, mature spores. Additionally, development and spore production cannot be rescued by co-developing autophagy mutant cells with wild-type cells in a chimeric organism (Fig. 4). Thus, these autophagy mutations are cell autonomous. It is not clear how these mutations prohibit proper development, but it may include interference with chemotaxis, motility, adhesion, intercellular signaling, or differentiation. The apg5− and apg7−mutants exhibit additional attributes of autophagy mutants. Survival in medium lacking amino acids is severely reduced (Fig. 5), similar to that described for yeast and plants. Yeast autophagy mutants die rapidly when starved of amino acids, and plants carrying autophagy mutations are susceptible to nutrient limitation. Autophagy is the major mechanism of bulk protein turnover when yeast cells are starved for nitrogen, accounting for 80% of protein turnover (22Schlumpberger M. Schaeffeler E. Straub M. Bredschneider M. Wolf D.H. Thumm M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1068-1076Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We find that starved Dictyostelium autophagy mutants degrade very little protein (10–15%), whereas starved wild-type cells and complemented autophagy mutants degrade 30–40% of the protein they contained at the end of growth (Fig. 6). A mutation in yakA, a gene that is required for the growth to development transition inDictyostelium (40Souza G.M. Lu S. Kuspa A. Development. 1998; 125: 2291-2302PubMed Google Scholar), does not affect the reduction in protein levels typical of starved cells, indicating that the earliest events in development are not required for the induction of autophagy-dependent proteolysis. We see a similar result when starvation-induced protein turnover is assayed in an adenylyl cyclase mutant (aca−) (data not shown). Theaca− mutant also survives as well as wild-type when starved for amino acids (data not shown), confirming that autophagy can be induced even in the absence of early developmental events that are usually triggered by starvation. Consistent with the protein turnover defect inapg5− and apg7−, we observe by transmission electron microscopy that turnover of organelles and cytoplasmic constituents in cells starved for amino acids for 36 h is impaired (Fig. 9). Wild-type cells show significant degradation of the cytoplasm, to such an extent that portions of the cytoplasm are electron-lucent. Additionally, large vesicles are observed that contain a small amount of membrane and granular material that appears highly degraded. Conversely, in the starved mutant cells, vesicles containing membrane whorls and cytoplasm with little evidence of degradation are observed. These enclosed membrane whorls are reminiscent of autophagosomes or autophagic vacuoles in mammalian cells (43Papadopoulos T. Pfeifer U. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 171: 110-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 44Niemann A. Takatsuki A. Elsasser H.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 251-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1997241564,"Microsomal prostaglandin E2 synthase-1 (mPGES-1) is a stimulus-inducible enzyme that functions downstream of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in the PGE2-biosynthetic pathway. Given the accumulating evidence that COX-2-derived PGE2 participates in the development of various tumors, including colorectal cancer, we herein examined the potential involvement of mPGES-1 in tumorigenesis. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated the expression of both COX-2 and mPGES-1 in human colon cancer tissues. HCA-7, a human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line that displays COX-2- and PGE2-dependent proliferation, expressed both COX-2 and mPGES-1 constitutively. Treatment of HCA-7 cells with an mPGES-1 inhibitor or antisense oligonucleotide attenuated, whereas overexpression of mPGES-1 accelerated, PGE2 production and cell proliferation. Moreover, cotransfection of COX-2 and mPGES-1 into HEK293 cells resulted in cellular transformation manifested by colony formation in soft agar culture and tumor formation when implanted subcutaneously into nude mice. cDNA array analyses revealed that this mPGES-1-directed cellular transformation was accompanied by changes in the expression of a variety of genes related to proliferation, morphology, adhesion, and the cell cycle. These results collectively suggest that aberrant expression of mPGES-1 in combination with COX-2 can contribute to tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2121822956,"In nerve terminals, residual Ca(2+) remaining from previous activity can cause facilitation of transmitter release by a mechanism that is still under debate. Here we show that the intracellular Ca(2+) sensitivity of transmitter release at the calyx of Held is largely unchanged during facilitation, which leaves an increased microdomain Ca(2+) signal as a possible mechanism for facilitation. We measured the Ca(2+) dependencies of facilitation, as well as of transmitter release, to estimate the required increment in microdomain Ca(2+). These measurements show that linear summation of residual and microdomain Ca(2+) accounts for only 30% of the observed facilitation. However, a small degree of supralinearity in the summation of intracellular Ca(2+) signals, which might be caused by saturation of cytosolic Ca(2+) buffer(s), is sufficient to explain facilitation at this CNS synapse."
https://openalex.org/W2080111827,"The ability of kinesin to travel long distances on its microtubule track without dissociating has led to a variety of models to explain how this remarkable degree of processivity is maintained.

A variety of kinetic, structural, and mechanical studies have revealed that this processive behavior requires that two motors of kinesin remain in different structural and enzymatic states during a processive run (7Hackney D.D.

This would ensure that, at any given time, at least one of the two heads would remain strongly attached to its track, preventing the motor from prematurely detaching. Such coordination requires a way for the two motor domains to communicate their structural states to each other while walking processively. Several lines of evidence suggest that this allosteric communication is mediated through the internal load generated when both heads attach to the microtubule (1Hancock W.O. Howard J. Proc. Natl.

As illustrated below in Fig. 1, kinesin initiates its mechanochemical cycle with its attached head (green) nucleotide free and its tethered head (magenta) containing ADP in the active site. ATP binding to the attached head reorients its neck linker (blue), which swings the tethered head forward to the next tubulin-docking site. ADP is then released from the new, weakly bound leading head (magenta) to produce an intermediate in which both heads are strongly bound to the microtubule. This situation would generate rearward strain on the neck linker of the leading head, depicted as a left pointing arrow, andforward strain on the corresponding structure of the trailing head, depicted as a right pointing arrow. It has been proposed that this strain generates processivity by accelerating release of the trailing head (13Schief W.R. Howard J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2001; 13: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 17Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4437-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, release of the ADP-containing trailing head would be very slow in the absence of forward strain and fast in its presence. In such a system, the greater that forward strain accelerateskdMT, the greater the degree of processivity. However, there is an internal inconsistency with this scheme. If kinesin's processivity were dependent solely on this mechanism, the motor would dissociate from the microtubule after only a few steps. The reasoning behind this is illustrated in Fig. 1. We have recently shown (18Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. Cheung H.C. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36731-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) that the effective rate of trailing head dissociation (kdMT ∼ 50 s−1) is appreciably slower than that for ADP release (kdADP = 170 s−1, this work, and Refs. 8Ma Y.Z.

This would lead to accumulation of a kinesin intermediate with both heads attached to the microtubule, with the leading head nucleotide free, and with ADP-Pi in the active site of the trailing head.

This would generate an intermediate with both heads weakly bound, and dissociation would rapidly follow, as indicated in Fig. 1 by the red X. The fact that kinesin is highly processive (1Hancock W.O.

Nature. 1999; 400: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar) argues that there is a mechanism that prevents it from proceeding down this pathway. An alternative possibility is that rearward strain on the leading head slows ATP binding and subsequent hydrolysis, insuring that the leading head would remain strongly attached until the trailing head had dissociated. ATP would then rapidly bind to the leading head and cause the trailing head to swing forward to the next tubulin-docking site. Processive movement would be favored, because the rate of this forward stepping movement, at ∼800 s−1, is nearly sixteen times faster than the rate of trailing head dissociation (18Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. Cheung H.C. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36731-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, blocking ATP binding to the forward head while it was experiencing rearward strain would prevent the motor from proceeding down the pathway marked by the red X in Fig.1. Determining whether processivity depends on the first mechanism, the second, or to some degree on both requires the ability to unambiguously measure the rates of key steps in the mechanochemical cycle and the effects of strain on these rates. These include the rates of trailing head dissociation, of ADP release from the tethered head after it attaches to the microtubule, and of ATP binding to the new, leading head. In this study, we apply the spectroscopic approaches developed in our prior work to make these measurements (15Xing J. Wriggers W. Jefferson G.M. Stein R. Cheung H.C. Rosenfeld S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35413-35420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. Cheung H.C. King P.H. J. Biol.

This has allowed us to generate a model that provides an efficient yet adaptable mechanism for insuring processivity in this motor. K413W340F, a cysteine-light recombinant kinesin construct with tryptophan 340 replaced by phenylalanine, consists of the first 413 amino-terminal residues of human kinesin, and was generated as described in our previous study (18Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. Cheung H.C. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36731-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). K413BIO is a construct in which K413W340F is fused at the carboxyl terminus to a biotinyl transferase recognition peptide, followed in turn by a hexahistidine tag for affinity purification. The peptide sequence, with its attached biotin, was incorporated into the K413 sequence to allow for attachment of the motor to streptavidin-coated beads used in motility assays in vitro. The plasmid containing the K413W340F mutant kinesin construct served as a PCR template to amplify the kinesin insert with the following primers: upstream, 5′-AGATATACATATGGCGGACCTGGCC-3′; downstream, 5′-AAGTTGCATGTGCTCGAGAAAATTTCCTATAACTCCAAT-3′. The underlined sequences are the NdeI andXhoI restriction sites, respectively. The fragment was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and excised withNdeI and XhoI. The fragment was purified and then ligated into a pET-21 vector with an in-frame biotinyl transferase recognition peptide sequence at the XhoI (carboxyl terminus) site. The resultant construct was verified by sequence analysis. Single molecule kinesin bead motility assays were performed essentially as described previously (24Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 386-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). 500-nm diameter carboxy-modified latex beads (Bangs Laboratories, Fishers, IN) were covalently biotinated with biotin-x-cadaverine (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), coated with avidin-DN (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and purified by repeated pelleting and resuspension followed by sonication to eliminate clumping. Diluted kinesin constructs were mixed with the beads and incubated at 4 °C for 4 h in assay buffer containing 80 mm PIPES,1 pH 6.9, 50 mm potassium acetate, 4 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEGTA, 7 μm Taxol, various ATP concentrations, and 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin as a blocking protein. The beads were diluted to 80 fm, and final kinesin dilutions were chosen such that, on average, fewer than half of the beads moved (typically 1:500,000 to 1:1,000,000 from ∼100 μm stock).

Flow cells with a volume of ∼20 μl were constructed by using two strips of doubly adhesive tape to form a channel between a microscope slide and a No. 1½ coverslip (cleaned by sonication in 5 m ethanolic KOH and coated with polylysine). Ingredients were introduced in the following order: taxol-stabilized MTs (polymerized from purified bovine brain tubulin, Cytoskeleton, Inc., Denver, CO) followed by a 10-min incubation, assay buffer wash followed by a 10-min incubation, and then kinesin:bead mixtures. To ensure that measurements reflected single molecule properties, data was only collected from assays in which fewer than half of the tested beads moved. All chemicals used were from Sigma, except bovine serum albumin and the ingredients used in the oxygen scavenging system (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). Kinesin velocities and run lengths were measured by centroid video tracking (25Gelles J. Schnapp B.J. Sheetz M.P.

Unless otherwise described, complexes of kinesin and microtubules were formed with a 5- to 10-fold molar excess of microtubules over active sites. ADP was added to 3 μm to ensure that the tethered kinesin head of a kinesin-microtubule complex contained ADP in the active site. Experiments with phosphate-binding protein were carried out in phosphate mop (0.2 unit/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase plus 1 mm 7 methylguanosine) with a 10-fold molar excess of MDCC-labeled phosphate-binding protein over kinesin active sites in both syringes. The experiments in this study utilize a cysteine-light dimeric kinesin construct (K413), and it was necessary to establish that this kinesin construct is processive. In our previous study, we provided enzymatic evidence that K413 is capable of undergoing multiple enzymatic cycles per diffusional encounter with the microtubule, a prerequisite for processivity (18Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. Cheung H.C. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36731-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Furthermore, attaching the biotin transferase recognition sequence to the carboxyl terminus of K413 had no appreciable effect on kcat (20 ± 2 s−1), K0.5,MT (0.30 ± 0.1 μm), or kbi,ADP (1.28 ± 0.15 μm−1s−1) (data not shown). However, enzymatic measures of processivity are indirect. To directly assess processive behavior, we examined the in vitromotility properties of K413BIO. As with wild-type kinesin, average in vitro velocities showed a Michaelis-Menten dependence on ATP concentration, defining values of Vmax andKmATP of 703 ± 73 nm/s and 23 ± 9 μm, respectively (Fig.2A). These compare with values of 650–800 nm/s and ∼80 μm for wild-type squid kinesin measured in our laboratory (6Visscher K. Schnitzer M.J. Block S.M. Nature. 1999; 400: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 27Svoboda K. Block S.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 773-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Fig. 2B illustrates the distribution of run lengths for K413BIO. Run length did not vary beyond experimental error over the range of ATP concentrations examined, and fitting data from all ATP concentrations to an exponential decay revealed a mean run length of 276 ± 22 nm. Thus, althoughin vitro velocities of K413BIO are similar to wild-type, mean run length is reduced by a factor of 2–3. Having established that K413BIO was processive, we decided to use it to test the two models of how kinesin uses strain to walk processively: that forwardstrain accelerates trailing head release or that rearwardstrain inhibits ATP binding to the leading head. If forward strain on the trailing head accelerates its release, then we would predict that release of the trailing head of a processively moving kinesin dimer should be faster than that for a non-processive monomeric construct, because the latter is incapable of generating internal strain. The steps leading to ATP-induced dissociation from the microtubule are summarized in Fig. 1. In this scheme, the observed dissociation rate, λATP, depends on the binding constant for ATP (KATP) and on the effective rate constant for ATP-induced dissociation, ke. The value of ke depends in turn on the values of the forward rate constants for the two irreversible steps that lead to dissociation, ATP hydrolysis (kh), and subsequent dissociation from the microtubule (kdMT). Under these conditions, λATP is defined by the following, λATP=KATP·[ATP]KATP·[ATP]+1·(ke)Equation 1 where ke =(kh·kdMT)/(kh+kdMT). If strain accelerates trailing head dissociation,ke should be greater for K413BIO than for K349. We measured the rate of trailing head dissociation for K413BIO and compared these results to those for monomeric K349. For K413BIO, this was accomplished using two spectroscopic probes, AEDANS and TMR, whose use we have previously described (18Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. Cheung H.C. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36731-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), whereas for K349 we utilized AEDANS and turbidity. The solid line in Fig.3 depicts the fitting of the AEDANS data (open boxes) for K413BIO to Equation 1, whereas thedotted line depicts the corresponding fitting of the AEDANS data (open diamonds) for K349. It is immediately apparent that λATP is consistently faster for monomeric kinesin than for trailing head dissociation by dimeric kinesin, the opposite of what would be expected if strain accelerated trailing head dissociation. The AEDANS probe monitors motor-microtubule association, and results with this probe for K349 are nearly identical to those using turbidity (data not shown). For K413BIO, the TMR probe monitors neck linker-neck linker reassociation, a step whose rate we have shown is kinetically controlled by dissociation of the trailing head (18Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. Cheung H.C. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36731-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We would therefore predict that results using the TMR probe (closed triangles) should be superimposable on those using the AEDANS probe (open boxes), and Fig. 3 confirms this. TableI summarizes the values ofKATP and ke for both probes. Nearly identical results were seen at 10 mm KCl (data not shown).Table IRate and equilibrium constants for ATP-induced dissociation of K413 and K349SampleProbeKATPkekpμms−1K349AEDANS91 ± 9116 ± 4K349Turbidity72 ± 1697 ± 7K349Pirelease (100 mm KCl)34 ± 292 ± 1K413AEDANS87 ± 2955 ± 6K413Rhodamine50 ± 2148 ± 6K413Pirelease (10 mm KCl)25 ± 544 ± 2K413Pi release (100 mmKCl)34 ± 1053 ± 5Conditions: 100 mm KCl, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT, pH 7.50, 20 °C.

The kinesin preparations were 3 μm, and microtubules were 40 μm.KATP, ke, andkI are defined in the text and were determined by fitting to Equation 1. Phosphate release occurs concomitantly with trailing head dissociation (1Hancock W.O. Howard J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13147-13152Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 2Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 800-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Therefore, measuring its release kinetics should provide an independent measure of ke. We accomplished this by mixing a complex of K413BIO-microtubules with a range of ATP concentrations in the presence of a fluorescently labeled phosphate-binding protein (28Gilbert S.P. Webb M.R. Brune M. Johnson K.A. Nature. 1995; 373: 671-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar) and compared our results to K349. The resulting fluorescence transient consisted of an initial exponential, burst phase, followed by a linear increase, which could be described by the following relationship, F(t)=A·exp(λp·t)+kss·tEquation 2 where F(t) is the time-dependent fluorescence, λp is the rate of phosphate release in the burst phase, and kss is the steady-state rate at the microtubule concentration achieved after mixing in the stopped flow. If phosphate release were tightly coupled to dissociation, values of λP and λATP should be nearly identical. This is confirmed in Fig. 3 for both K413BIO (open circles) and K349 (closed circles). Furthermore, the extrapolated value of λp at infinite [ATP],kp, should be essentially identical toke. As Table I indicates, this is the case for both monomeric and dimeric kinesin constructs. Finally, our results with phosphate release kinetics confirm the results from turbidity and fluorescence, namely that the effective rate constant for trailing head dissociation is not accelerated by forward strain. In the absence of added nucleotide, kinesin attaches to the microtubule via only one motor domain (7Hackney D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6865-6869Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 8Ma Y.Z. Taylor E.W. J. Biol.

This is illustrated in Fig. 1 by theupper left kinesin-microtubule complex. If ADP is added, it will bind to the empty catalytic site of the attached (green) head and dissociate the complex (17Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4437-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This reaction would occur in the absence of internal strain, because ADP does not induce forward stepping and strong attachment of the other, tethered (magenta) head. We would, therefore, predict that the kinetics of K413BIO and K349 dissociation from the microtubule should be identical. This is confirmed by comparing the solid(K413BIO) and dashed (K349) curves in theinset of Fig. 4. ADP-induced dissociation was monitored by turbidity and by the AEDANS probe. Data for turbidity (closed symbols) and AEDANS (open symbols) are nearly identical and showed a hyperbolic dependence on [ADP] for both K413BIO and K349, defining maximum rates and apparent dissociation constants of 201 ± 27 s−1 and 154 ± 58 μm and 219 ± 16 s−1 and 123 ± 19 μm, respectively. ADP dissociates wild-type kinesin from the microtubule at a rate of ∼12 s−1 (17Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4437-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 31Ma Y.-Z. Taylor E.W. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13242-13251Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). This is considerably slower thankcat under processive conditions, under conditions where strain would be present, and this finding has been used to support the argument that trailing head dissociation is accelerated by forward strain (17Hackney D.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4437-4446Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). If processivity depended solely on this mechanism, it would follow that any mutation in kinesin that accelerates the rate of ADP-induced dissociation in the absence of strain should reduce average run length proportionally. Nevertheless, our data show that, although the rate of ADP-induced dissociation for K413BIO is nearly 19-fold larger than for wild-type, mean run length is only reduced 2- to 3-fold (Fig. 2). We next set out to examine the effect of rearward strain on the leading head by measuring the kinetics of 2′-deoxy-mant-ATP (2′dmT) binding to a K413BIO-microtubule complex. Binding of 2′dmT was monitored by FRET from kinesin tyrosine residues to the mant fluorophor, as previously described (18Rosenfeld S.S. Xing J. Jefferson G.M. Cheung H.C. King P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36731-36739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the experimental design is illustrated in Fig. 5A. In the absence of microtubules, binding of 2′dmT to nucleotide-free K413BIO produced a fluorescence increase characterized by a single phase (Fig. 5B, −microtubules). The rate depended hyperbolically on [2′dmT], defining a maximum of 1033 ± 153 s−1 (Fig. 5B, inset,dotted curve). By contrast, mixing a 1:10 K413BIO-microtubule complex with 2′dmT produced a fluorescence increase that occurred in two distinct phases of similar amplitudes, separated by a lag (Fig. 5B, +microtubules). The rate of the first phase showed a hyperbolic dependence"

Here we now report findings of immunocytochemical and biochemical characterization of a mammalian septin, MSF-A. Using an antibody specific for MSF subfamily proteins, MSF-A was found to be expressed predominantly in mammary human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC). MSF-A was associated with microtubules in interphase HMEC cells as it localized with the mitotic spindle and the bundle of microtubule at midzone during mitosis. Biochemical analysis revealed direct binding of MSF-A with polymerized tubulin through its central region containing guanine nucleotide-interactive motifs. GTPase activity, however, was not required for the association. Conditions that disrupt the microtubule network also disrupted the MSF-A-containing filament structure, resulting in a punctate cytoplasmic pattern. Depletion of MSF-A using small interfering RNAs caused incomplete cell division and resulted in the accumulation of binucleated cells. Unlike Nedd5, an MSF mutant deficient in GTPase activity forms filament indistinguishable from that of the wild type in COS cells. These results strongly suggest that septin filaments may interact not only with actin filaments but also with microtubule networks and that GTPase activity of MSF-A is not indispensable to incorporation of MSF-A into septin filaments.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 839-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although septins have 25% or greater identity over their entire length, sequence similarity is greatest in the central domain, which contains guanine nucleotide interactive motifs homologous to those of ras-related small GTPases. In addition to the conserved central domain, most septins have divergent N- and C-terminal domains, some of which contain a predicted coiled-coil region possibly involved in protein-protein interaction. Although the ras-related small GTPases function as signal transducing molecular switches through GTP/GDP-exchange and GTP-hydrolysis, little is known of the physiological significance of mammalian septins.Although septins were initially thought to play important roles in controlling cytokinesis of budding yeast (7Hartwell L.H Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 69: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), it is now well established that they are also required for localized chitin deposition, bud site selection, cell cycle control, plasma membrane compartmentalization, and regulation of some kinases (for review, see Refs. 1Longtine M.S.

The accumulating biochemical and cell biological observations on lower eukaryotic septins suggest that either they comprise a novel cytoskeletal polymer or they function as scaffolds for assembly of signaling complexes.Numerous mammalian homologues of yeast septins have been identified mainly based on random sequencing projects (reviewed in Ref. 6Kartmann B. Roth D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 839-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the septins probably represent alternative splicing forms. The gene mixed lineage leukemia septin-like fusion (MSF)1 has been identified as a fusion partner gene of mixed lineage leukemia in a case of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia with a t(11,17)(q23;q25) (8Osaka M.

Hayashi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4261-4265PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, two alternative splicing variants, MSF-A and MSF-B, were identified (10Kalikin L.M. Sims H.L. Petty E.M.

MSF has been found to be deleted in some cases of breast and ovarian cancers; hence, it was considered to be a candidate for tumor suppressor gene (10Kalikin L.M. Sims H.L. Petty E.M.

Although these findings provided insights into a possible role for MSF in leukemogenesis and oncogenesis, not only the molecular mechanism(s) regarding MSF function and tumorigenesis but also biochemical and biological properties of MSF proteins remain to be elucidated. We did a biochemical and biological characterization of MSF-A and found that MSF-A interacts with microtubules in vitro and in vivo. The biological significance of GTPase activity of MSF-A was investigated and compared with that of well characterized septin, Nedd5.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we found that MSF-A, a member of the MSF family and predominantly expressed in mammary HMEC cells, distributes along with microtubules in the cells. The septin filament structure containing MSF-A depends on the integrity of microtubules because microtubule disruption by demecolcine induced septin filament disruption in HMEC cells. When RNAi reduced expression of MSF-A in HMEC cells, the cells displayed failed cell division more frequently than control cells; consequently, 10–12% of the MSF-A-RNAi-treated cells became binuclear. Additionally, ∼14% of the cells with reduced level of MSF-A showed lower levels of microtubules, although the physiological relevance of this phenotype remains to be elucidated. We noted that MSF-A directly binds with polymerized tubulin in vitro through the center domain containing guanine nucleotide-interactive motifs, although GTPase activity of MSF-A does not seem to be required for binding to microtubules.The function of septins in cytokinesis is likely to be conserved in higher eukaryotic cells as well as in yeast (17Kinoshita M.

Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 22Xie H. Surka M. Howard J. Trimble W.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As for MSF-A, a recent study demonstrated that it colocalizes with actin stress fibers as well as microtubules in HeLa cells (21Surka M.C. Tsang C.W. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3532-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), suggesting interaction of MSF-A with actin filaments. On the other hand, our data showed that the filamentous structure of MSF-A in HMEC cells was conserved in cytochalasin B-treated cells. A possible explanation is that efficient interaction of MSF-A with actin filaments needs other molecule(s), such as other MSF subfamily of the proteins, because HMEC cells predominantly express MSF-A, whereas HeLa cells express MSF-A, MSF, and MSF-B equally.It is notable that MSF-A-containing septin filaments in HMEC cells are disrupted by demecolcine treatment and MSF-A interacts with microtubules in vitro. The physiological significance of interactions between MSF-A and microtubules is an enigma; however, we speculate that MSF-A plays a role in microtubule-dependent secretory pathways because 1) microtubules play important roles within the secretory pathway in mediating the anterograde and retrograde traffic of vesicular and tubular intermediates between ER and the Golgi complex (for review, see Ref. 29Cole N.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and 2) there is a large body of evidence that microtubules are involved in post-Golgi protein trafficking: microtubules are required for the efficient transport of membrane proteins to the apical surface via a direct (30Lafont F. Burkhardt J. Simons K. Nature. 1994; 372: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or an indirect transcytotic pathway (31Breitfield P.P. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is also notable that MSF-A localizes largely along the mitotic spindle in mitotic HMEC cells, which suggests some function in mitotic processes. Although the functional relevance of MSF-A in the mitotic process remains to be elucidated, MSF-A may play a role in microtubule-dependent mitotic processes and perturbation of the function might induce cell cycle abnormalities resulting in oncogenesis.Mammalian septins, such as Nedd5 and H5, were noted in immunofluorescent studies to be localized along with actin stress fibers (17Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 22Xie H. Surka M. Howard J. Trimble W.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because H5 and Nedd5 are detectable in HMEC cells by Western blot analyses, 2K. Nagata and M. Inagaki, unpublished data. MSF-A, Nedd5, and H5 may function, in harmony with other septin molecules, to coordinate control of actin- and tubulin-dependent cellular events. Another possibility is that these septins function as filamentous scaffolds for organization of proteins at a specific region inside the cell, because many proteins depend on septins for localization (reviewed in Refs. 1Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J. Valencik M.L. Al-Awar O.S. Fares H. DeVirgilio C. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 3Field C.M. Kellogg D.

Microbiol. 2001; 4: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Budding yeast septins were found to function as a scaffold that allows for assembly of multiprotein complexes required for activation of Gin4 and Hsl kinases, which are activated and control bud growth during mitosis (33Carroll C.W. Altman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Kellogg D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34Longtine M.S. Fares H. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this context, we found that MSF interacts with mixed lineage kinase 2 in vivo,2 which is distributed together with activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase along microtubules (35Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata N. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), meaning that septin scaffolds probably regulate mixed lineage kinase 2-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. The septin complex may function as scaffolds in various cellular events that also link actin and microtubule networks. Cytological investigations are under way to clarify the physiological significance of the septin complex.The results obtained by RNAi experiments are consistent with the recent observation that MSF-A and/or the splicing variants play an important role in cytokinesis in HeLa cells (21Surka M.C. Tsang C.W. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3532-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In HMEC cells, MSF-A is possibly involved in cytokinetic process cooperatively with other septins such as Nedd5 (17Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) because it is a dominant MSF subtype in the cells. In addition, a weak staining pattern of microtubules was observed in ∼14% of HMEC cells with reduced levels of MSF-A. Although some cells with reduced levels of MSF-A became binucleated, obvious correlation between the extent of reduction of MSF-A expression and cytokinetic defect was not observed. Whether or not MSF-A-knockdown affects the microtubule structure and how MSF-A plays a physiological role in relation to microtubule functions and cytokinesis are interesting areas for future examination. To test the role of MSF-A in microtubule organization, anti-MSF antibody was microinjected into HMEC cells. However, the antibody reacted with endogenous MSF-A and clearly colocalized with filamentous MSF-A; therefore, the antibody could not induce morphological change of microtubules (data not shown). We assume that the antibody recognized MSF-A but could not disrupt the filamentous structure.In the present study, we report the inter-relationship of a septin with microtubules. Characterization of the MSF-A demonstrated here may represent initiation of the unraveling of a septin function linking actin and microtubule networks and various mammalian septin-dependent key events. Septins, a family of heteropolymeric filament-forming proteins, were originally discovered in yeast to be essential for budding, and have since been identified in most eukaryotic organisms, with the exception of plants (for review, see Refs. 1Longtine M.S.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 839-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although septins have 25% or greater identity over their entire length, sequence similarity is greatest in the central domain, which contains guanine nucleotide interactive motifs homologous to those of ras-related small GTPases. In addition to the conserved central domain, most septins have divergent N- and C-terminal domains, some of which contain a predicted coiled-coil region possibly involved in protein-protein interaction. Although the ras-related small GTPases function as signal transducing molecular switches through GTP/GDP-exchange and GTP-hydrolysis, little is known of the physiological significance of mammalian septins. Although septins were initially thought to play important roles in controlling cytokinesis of budding yeast (7Hartwell L.H Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 69: 265-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar), it is now well established that they are also required for localized chitin deposition, bud site selection, cell cycle control, plasma membrane compartmentalization, and regulation of some kinases (for review, see Refs. 1Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J. Valencik M.L. Al-Awar O.S. Fares H. DeVirgilio C. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 2Chant J.

Microbiol. 2001; 4: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The accumulating biochemical and cell biological observations on lower eukaryotic septins suggest that either they comprise a novel cytoskeletal polymer or they function as scaffolds for assembly of signaling complexes. Numerous mammalian homologues of yeast septins have been identified mainly based on random sequencing projects (reviewed in Ref. 6Kartmann B. Roth D. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 839-844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the septins probably represent alternative splicing forms. The gene mixed lineage leukemia septin-like fusion (MSF)1 has been identified as a fusion partner gene of mixed lineage leukemia in a case of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia with a t(11,17)(q23;q25) (8Osaka M. Rowley J.D. Zeleznik-Le N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6428-6433Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9Taki T. Ohnishi H. Shinohara K. Sako M. Bessho F. Yanagisawa M. Hayashi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4261-4265PubMed Google Scholar). Thereafter, two alternative splicing variants, MSF-A and MSF-B, were identified (10Kalikin L.M. Sims H.L. Petty E.M. Genomics. 2000; 63: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and another report described the complicated transcriptional pattern of MSF (11McIlhatton M.A. Burrows J.F. Donaghy P.G. Chanduloy S. Johnston P.G. Russell S.E.H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5930-5939Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MSF has been found to be deleted in some cases of breast and ovarian cancers; hence, it was considered to be a candidate for tumor suppressor gene (10Kalikin L.M. Sims H.L. Petty E.M. Genomics. 2000; 63: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Russell S.E.H. McIlhatton M.A. Burrows J.F. Donaghy P.G. Chanduloy S. Petty E.M. Kalikin L.M. Church S.W. McIlroy S.

Although these findings provided insights into a possible role for MSF in leukemogenesis and oncogenesis, not only the molecular mechanism(s) regarding MSF function and tumorigenesis but also biochemical and biological properties of MSF proteins remain to be elucidated. We did a biochemical and biological characterization of MSF-A and found that MSF-A interacts with microtubules in vitro and in vivo. The biological significance of GTPase activity of MSF-A was investigated and compared with that of well characterized septin, Nedd5. DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we found that MSF-A, a member of the MSF family and predominantly expressed in mammary HMEC cells, distributes along with microtubules in the cells. The septin filament structure containing MSF-A depends on the integrity of microtubules because microtubule disruption by demecolcine induced septin filament disruption in HMEC cells. When RNAi reduced expression of MSF-A in HMEC cells, the cells displayed failed cell division more frequently than control cells; consequently, 10–12% of the MSF-A-RNAi-treated cells became binuclear. Additionally, ∼14% of the cells with reduced level of MSF-A showed lower levels of microtubules, although the physiological relevance of this phenotype remains to be elucidated. We noted that MSF-A directly binds with polymerized tubulin in vitro through the center domain containing guanine nucleotide-interactive motifs, although GTPase activity of MSF-A does not seem to be required for binding to microtubules.The function of septins in cytokinesis is likely to be conserved in higher eukaryotic cells as well as in yeast (17Kinoshita M.

Mammalian septins are thought to be related to actin filament structures (17Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 22Xie H. Surka M. Howard J. Trimble W.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As for MSF-A, a recent study demonstrated that it colocalizes with actin stress fibers as well as microtubules in HeLa cells (21Surka M.C. Tsang C.W. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3532-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), suggesting interaction of MSF-A with actin filaments. On the other hand, our data showed that the filamentous structure of MSF-A in HMEC cells was conserved in cytochalasin B-treated cells. A possible explanation is that efficient interaction of MSF-A with actin filaments needs other molecule(s), such as other MSF subfamily of the proteins, because HMEC cells predominantly express MSF-A, whereas HeLa cells express MSF-A, MSF, and MSF-B equally. It is notable that MSF-A-containing septin filaments in HMEC cells are disrupted by demecolcine treatment and MSF-A interacts with microtubules in vitro. The physiological significance of interactions between MSF-A and microtubules is an enigma; however, we speculate that MSF-A plays a role in microtubule-dependent secretory pathways because 1) microtubules play important roles within the secretory pathway in mediating the anterograde and retrograde traffic of vesicular and tubular intermediates between ER and the Golgi complex (for review, see Ref. 29Cole N.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar), and 2) there is a large body of evidence that microtubules are involved in post-Golgi protein trafficking: microtubules are required for the efficient transport of membrane proteins to the apical surface via a direct (30Lafont F. Burkhardt J. Simons K. Nature. 1994; 372: 801-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) or an indirect transcytotic pathway (31Breitfield P.P. McKinnon W.C. Mostov K.E. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2365-2373Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Hunziker W. Male P. Mellman I. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3515-3525Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It is also notable that MSF-A localizes largely along the mitotic spindle in mitotic HMEC cells, which suggests some function in mitotic processes. Although the functional relevance of MSF-A in the mitotic process remains to be elucidated, MSF-A may play a role in microtubule-dependent mitotic processes and perturbation of the function might induce cell cycle abnormalities resulting in oncogenesis. Mammalian septins, such as Nedd5 and H5, were noted in immunofluorescent studies to be localized along with actin stress fibers (17Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 22Xie H. Surka M. Howard J. Trimble W.S. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1999; 43: 52-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because H5 and Nedd5 are detectable in HMEC cells by Western blot analyses, 2K. Nagata and M. Inagaki, unpublished data. MSF-A, Nedd5, and H5 may function, in harmony with other septin molecules, to coordinate control of actin- and tubulin-dependent cellular events. Another possibility is that these septins function as filamentous scaffolds for organization of proteins at a specific region inside the cell, because many proteins depend on septins for localization (reviewed in Refs. 1Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J. Valencik M.L. Al-Awar O.S. Fares H. DeVirgilio C. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 3Field C.M. Kellogg D.

Microbiol. 2001; 4: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Budding yeast septins were found to function as a scaffold that allows for assembly of multiprotein complexes required for activation of Gin4 and Hsl kinases, which are activated and control bud growth during mitosis (33Carroll C.W. Altman R. Schieltz D. Yates J. Kellogg D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 34Longtine M.S. Fares H. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In this context, we found that MSF interacts with mixed lineage kinase 2 in vivo,2 which is distributed together with activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase along microtubules (35Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata N. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), meaning that septin scaffolds probably regulate mixed lineage kinase 2-mediated c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation. The septin complex may function as scaffolds in various cellular events that also link actin and microtubule networks. Cytological investigations are under way to clarify the physiological significance of the septin complex. The results obtained by RNAi experiments are consistent with the recent observation that MSF-A and/or the splicing variants play an important role in cytokinesis in HeLa cells (21Surka M.C. Tsang C.W. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 3532-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In HMEC cells, MSF-A is possibly involved in cytokinetic process cooperatively with other septins such as Nedd5 (17Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) because it is a dominant MSF subtype in the cells. In addition, a weak staining pattern of microtubules was observed in ∼14% of HMEC cells with reduced levels of MSF-A. Although some cells with reduced levels of MSF-A became binucleated, obvious correlation between the extent of reduction of MSF-A expression and cytokinetic defect was not observed. Whether or not MSF-A-knockdown affects the microtubule structure and how MSF-A plays a physiological role in relation to microtubule functions and cytokinesis are interesting areas for future examination. To test the role of MSF-A in microtubule organization, anti-MSF antibody was microinjected into HMEC cells. However, the antibody reacted with endogenous MSF-A and clearly colocalized with filamentous MSF-A; therefore, the antibody could not induce morphological change of microtubules (data not shown). We assume that the antibody recognized MSF-A but could not disrupt the filamentous structure. In the present study, we report the inter-relationship of a septin with microtubules. Characterization of the MSF-A demonstrated here may represent initiation of the unraveling of a septin function linking actin and microtubule networks and various mammalian septin-dependent key events.

One effector, YopM, is necessary for Yersinia virulence, but its function in host cells is unknown. To identify potential cellular pathways affected by YopM, proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with YopM in mammalian cells were isolated and identified by mass spectrometry. Results demonstrate that two kinases, protein kinase C-like 2 (PRK2) and ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (RSK1), interact directly with YopM. These two kinases associate only when YopM is present, and expression of YopM in cells stimulates the activity of both kinases. RSK1 is activated directly by interaction with YopM, and RSK1 kinase activity is required for YopM-stimulated PRK2 activity. YopM activation of RSK1 occurs independently of the actions of YopJ on the MAPK pathway. YopM is also required for Yersinia-induced changes in RSK1 mobility in infected macrophage cells. These results identify the first intracellular targets of YopM and suggest YopM acts to stimulate the activity of PRK2 and RSK1.

Yersinia pestis causes plague and is transmitted by fleas from rodent reservoirs to humans, frequently resulting in fatal infections. This bacterium is responsible for three plague pandemics and has been involved in two plague epidemics in western India as recently as 1944 (1Perry R.D. Fetherston J.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 35-66Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two other species,Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, are also human pathogens, and infection with these species results in gastrointestinal disorders such as appendicitis, ileocolitis, and mesenteric adenitis. Contaminated food or water is the most common route of infection by these species, with swine serving as a major reservoir for these bacteria (2Bottone E.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 257-276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the severity of the disease and the mode of transmission of pathogenicYersinia species differs, they all target lymphoid tissues and are able to block innate immune responses to allow extracellular replication of the bacterium. Yersinia spp. harbor a virulence plasmid of ∼70 kb that encodes proteins termed Yops1(for Yersiniaouterproteins) that are either intracellular effectors or membrane proteins that create a delivery system for these effectors (3Juris S.J. Shao F. Dixon J.E. Cell Microbiol. 2002; 4: 201-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,4Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six effector proteins from Yersinia (YopE, YopH, YopJ/P, YopM, YopT, and YpkA/YopO) are delivered into eukaryotic cells to inactivate the host immune response. YopE, YopH, YopT, and YpkA target the actin cytoskeleton through different mechanisms to prevent phagocytosis of the bacterium. YopJ inhibits the production of certain inflammatory cytokines by blocking the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NFκB signaling pathways. YopJ has also been implicated in apoptosis induction in macrophages through caspase-8 activation and inhibition of NFκB-induced transcription. The effects of YopM on host response to Yersinia infection are largely unknown. However, YopM is required for full virulence ofY. pestis and Y. enterocolitica, as demonstrated in mouse infection models (5Leung K.Y. Reisner B.S. Straley S.C. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Mulder B. Michiels T. Simonet M. Sory M.P. Cornelis G. Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2534-2541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The YopM protein is an acidic, ∼42-kDa protein composed almost entirely of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) motifs. The LRR motif is thought to be a protein-protein interaction motif and is present in multiple signaling molecules found both intracellularly and extracellularly (7Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Initial studies suggested that YopM is secreted from the bacteria and interacts with thrombin to inhibit platelet aggregation (8Reisner B.S. Straley S.C. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 5242-5252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent studies demonstrated that YopM is translocated into target cells via the type III secretion apparatus (9Boland A. Sory M.P. Iriarte M. Kerbourch C. Wattiau P. Cornelis G.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5191-5201Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Once inside the target cell, YopM moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus via a vesicle-associated pathway (10Skrzypek E. Cowan C. Straley S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1051-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Skrzypek E. Myers-Morales T. Whiteheart S.W. Straley S.C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A gene chip microarray analysis of Y. enterocolitica-infected macrophage cell lines suggests that YopM affects the expression of genes involved in cell cycle and cell growth (12Sauvonnet N.

However, the mechanism by which YopM produces these effects on gene expression is unknown. This paper describes the identification of two intracellular targets of YopM, protein kinase C-like 2 (PRK2) and ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (RSK1). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) + penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen).

FLAG-YopM was constructed by amplifying by PCR nucleotides 7–1265 of YopM from the Y. enterocolitica virulence plasmid, pYVe8081, and cloning into pFLAG-CMV-2 (Eastman Kodak Co.), resulting in the incorporation of an amino-terminal FLAG tag. EGFP-YopM was constructed by PCR amplifying YopM (nucleotides 7–1265) from FLAG-YopM and cloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) resulting in a fusion protein with an amino-terminal EGFP tag. The p67N-YopM plasmid was constructed by PCR amplifying nucleotides 1–1265 of Y. enterocolitica YopM and cloning into pMMB67HE (14Furste J.P. Pansegrau W. Frank R. Blocker H. Scholz P. Bagdasarian M.

PRK2 deletion constructs were produced by PCR amplification of regions of human PRK2 and cloning into the mammalian expression vector pEBG-3X, resulting in the incorporation of a GST tag on the amino terminus. Mammalian expression constructs of avian RSK1 (HA-RSK1 and HA-RSK1 K112/464R) were gifts of John Blenis, Harvard Medical School (16Shimamura A. Ballif B.A. Richards S.A. Blenis J. Curr.

The mammalian expression construct of rat RSK1 (pMT2-HA-RSK1) was a gift of Valerie Castle, University of Michigan (17Grove J.R. Price D.J. Banerjee P. Balasubramanyam A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7727-7738Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). RSK1 deletion constructs were produced by PCR amplification of regions of rat RSK1 and cloning into pcDNA3-HA. Subcloning an EcoRI fragment of pMT2-HA-RSK1 into pcDNA3 created the RSK1 template for in vitrotranscription/translation. pSFFV-YopJ-FLAG was a gift of Kim Orth (18Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). 293 cells were transfected in 100-mm plates with 5 μg of expression plasmid for a total of 40–45 h. Prior to harvest, cells were starved in DMEM for 16–18 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in RIPA− buffer (150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm pefabloc (Roche Applied Science), 10 μm leupeptin (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm benzamidine (Sigma), 10 μm E64 (Sigma)) followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. For cell fractionation experiments, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (19Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Lysates were precleared with 10–20 μl of protein G-agarose (Invitrogen) for 30 min of rocking at 4 °C. Lysates were then incubated with 15–20 μl of anti-FLAG M2-Sepharose (Sigma) or 1–2 μg of antibody and 10–20 μl of protein G-agarose for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed 4 times with 1 ml of 1 m RIPA− buffer (1 mNaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40), 2 times with 1 ml of 500 mmRIPA− buffer (500 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 8, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40), and 2 times with 1 ml of RIPA− buffer. Immunoprecipitates used in kinase assays were washed an additional 2 times with 1 ml of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgAc. Silver staining of SDS-PAGE gels was performed as described previously (20Blum H. Gross H.J. Beier H. Virology. 1989; 169: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates from 12 to 16 100-mm plates of transfected 293 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by staining in 0.25% Coomassie Blue, 10% glacial acetic acid, 40% MeOH. The gel was destained in 10% glacial acetic acid, 40% MeOH and dried onto Whatman paper. Protein bands of interest were excised from the dried gel and digested with trypsin as described previously (21Vacratsis P.O. Phinney B.S. Gage D.A. Gallo K.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5613-5624Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a Voyager DE-STR instrument (Applied Biosystems) in linear positive mode or reflector positive mode (for PSD analysis) using α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as the UV absorbing matrix. Peptide values from the mass fingerprint were used to search the NCBI data base using the Profound and MS-Fit software tools. Nanospray LC/MS/MS was performed on a LCQDECA quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan) equipped with a picoview nanospray source (New Objective). A 5-μl aliquot of the pool of tryptic peptides was injected onto a 75-μm inner diameter × 15-cm C18 picofrit column (New Objective) that terminated in a 15-μm tip spray needle. Peptides were eluted with 60% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid. Mass spectra was acquired using the Top3 triple play mode, and MS/MS spectra were used to search the NCBI using SEQUEST software. Immunoprecipitated proteins were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgAc, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), with 1 μg of MBP (Sigma) as substrate in a 20-μl reaction volume. One-third of the reaction was separated by SDS-PAGE, dried onto Whatman paper, and exposed to film at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. The PRK2 and RSK1 kinases werein vitro transcribed and translated in the presence of [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the TnT T7 Quick-coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega) from linearized PRK2-V5 (AgeI) or pcDNA3-HA-RSK1 (NcoI) plasmid templates. Radiolabeled proteins were incubated with bacterially produced recombinant YopM-6xHis protein bound to nickel-agarose beads (Qiagen) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40. Beads were subsequently washed with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm imidazole and run out on SDS-PAGE. The gel was fixed in 40% MeOH, 10% glacial acetic acid, treated with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences), and dried onto Whatman paper. The gel was then exposed to film at −80 °C with a screen. The Y. pseudotuberculosis strains used in this study were derived from YP126 (serogroup O:3). YP22 has been described previously (22Palmer L.E. Hobbie S. Galan J.E. Bliska J.B. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and is deficient for the expression of YopE, YopH, and YopK proteins. The YP33 strain was derived from YP22 and contains a frameshift inyopM, disrupting the expression of the YopM protein. The YP33/yopM strain was constructed by introducing the IPTG-inducible YopM expression plasmid, p67N-YopM into YP33 through conjugation. Yersinia strains were grown in Luria broth at 26 °C, diluted 1:40 in Luria broth supplemented with 20 mm sodium oxalate and 20 mm MgCl2(A600 0.1), and grown for 1 h at 26 °C. These cultures were then shifted to 37 °C and grown for an additional 2 h. For infections using YP33/yopM, YopM expression was induced with 0.1 mm IPTG for the 2 h at 37 °C. Yersinia were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen) and resuspended atA600 0.5 in Hanks' balanced salt solution. J774A.1 cells were grown to 80–90% confluency in DMEM + 10% FBS + 1 mm sodium pyruvate and infected for 2 h at 37 °C at a multiplicity of infection of 50. The crystal structure of YopM has been solved and reveals that the YopM monomer has an amino-terminal α-helical hairpin followed by a curving repeat structure composed of LRR motifs (23Evdokimov A.G. Anderson D.E. Routzahn K.M. Waugh D.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 312: 807-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The LRR motifs in YopM form a structure that has a concave face composed of β-sheets and a polyproline II helical conformation on the convex side. YopM is also shown to form a homo-tetramer that creates a tube-like structure with a pore of ∼35 Å. The structure does not indicate a catalytic function for YopM but instead suggests that it may act as a protein scaffold recruiting proteins into a complex. To identify potential cellular targets affected by thisYersinia effector, a biochemical approach was used to identify proteins that interact with YopM in mammalian cells. In this approach, proteins that associate with YopM in transiently transfected cells were isolated by immunoprecipitation and identified by mass spectrometry. Lysates from 293 cells transfected with a FLAG-YopM expression vector or the empty FLAG vector were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and the associated proteins were visualized by silver stain of SDS-PAGE gels (Fig.1A). Three proteins with approximate molecular masses of 120, 80, and 78 kDa were found to specifically co-immunoprecipitate with YopM. The YopM-associated proteins were excised from a Coomassie-stained gel, trypsin-digested, and the resulting peptides analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry or nanospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). The pool of p120 tryptic peptides was analyzed by MALDI-TOF (Fig.1B). The peptide values from the peptide mass fingerprint were used to search the NCBI non-redundant data base using two web site tools, ProFound (prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFound) (24Zhang W. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2000; 72: 2482-2489Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar), and MS-Fit (prospector.ucsf.edu). Both programs predicted the identity of p120 to be protein kinase C-like 2 (PRK2), a novel serine/threonine protein kinase of the protein kinase C family (25Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 356: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 26Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In addition, MALDI post-source decay (PSD) was employed to obtain partial sequence information on two prominent peptides in the mass fingerprint and were found to match the PRK2 sequence. The identity of the p80 and p78 proteins was determined by LC/MS/MS analysis (Fig. 1C). The MS/MS fragmentation spectra was used to search the NCBI non-redundant data base for protein identification. Three MS/MS spectra from the p80 and p78 samples unambiguously identified these proteins as p90 ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (RSK1/p90rsk/MAPKAP-K1), a member of the growth factor-regulated S6 serine/threonine kinase family (27Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar, 28Frodin M. Gammeltoft S. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 151: 65-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The mass spectral identification of p120, p80, and p78 was confirmed by Western blot analysis of YopM-associated proteins (Fig.2A). Lysates from 293 cells transfected with a FLAG-YopM plasmid or vector alone were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, and proteins were visualized by sequential Western blots using anti-FLAG, anti-PRK2, and anti-RSK1 antibodies. A single ∼45-kDa protein corresponding to FLAG-YopM was detected in anti-FLAG Western blots. Anti-PRK2 Western blots reacted with a single band of 120 kDa co-immunoprecipitating with FLAG-YopM. Anti-RSK1 Western blots detected a YopM co-immunoprecipitating doublet of ∼80 kDa. These results confirm the mass spectral identification of p120 as PRK2 and p80/p78 as RSK1. The ability of YopM to interact with these cellular proteins was examined in Yersinia-infected cells to determine whether the interactions detected in transfected cells are also seen in the context of an infection. The macrophage cell line J774A.1 was infected withyopM+ (YP22) or yopM−(YP33) Y. pseudotuberculosis strains, immunoprecipitated with YopM polyclonal antisera, and the co-immunoprecipitation of RSK1 and PRK2 determined by Western blot. YopM co-immunoprecipitated RSK1 (Fig. 2B), but the co-immunoprecipitation of PRK2 was not detectable in this assay (data not shown). The inability to detect PRK2 may be due to a number of factors but is most likely associated with the quality of the YopM antisera. For example, when FLAG-YopM-transfected 293 cells were immunoprecipitated with the YopM antiserum, the interaction of PRK2 and YopM was much weaker and difficult to detect (data not shown), indicating that the antiserum does not effectively immunoprecipitate the YopM-PRK2 complex. However, our result firmly establishes that YopM forms a complex with RSK1 inY. pseudotuberculosis-infected macrophage cells. The interaction of YopM with PRK2 and RSK1 was also assessed in vitro to determine whether these kinases bind to YopM directly. Recombinant YopM with a His6 tag was bound to nickel beads and incubated with radiolabeled in vitrotranscribed/translated kinases (Fig. 2C). Proteins bound to the YopM beads were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the association of the kinases was visualized by fluorography. Both PRK2 and RSK1 bound to recombinant YopM in vitro. Deletion of the carboxyl terminus of these kinases abolished interaction with YopM in this assay (data not shown). These results, as well as results described in experiments to follow (Fig. 3), indicate that a region in the carboxyl-terminal half of these kinases is required for interaction with YopM. The in vitro binding data suggest a direct interaction between YopM and PRK2, as well as YopM and RSK1. Further experiments were performed to determine whether YopM forms a single complex with these two kinases or two separate kinase complexes. Lysates from vector-transfected cells or cells transfected with FLAG-YopM were immunoprecipitated with anti-PRK2, anti-RSK1, or anti-FLAG antibodies, and proteins were visualized by Western blot (Fig. 2D). In vector-transfected cells, PRK2 and RSK1 do not co-immunoprecipitate, indicating that these two kinases normally do not associate in cells (lanes 2 and 3). However, in cells that express YopM, PRK2 co-immunoprecipitated both YopM and RSK1 (lane 4). RSK1 immunoprecipitates also showed interaction with both PRK2 and YopM (lane 5). These results demonstrate that YopM forms a single complex with PRK2 and RSK1 in transfected cells and that YopM induces the association of PRK2 and RSK1. The subcellular localization of YopM is distinct from the other Yop effectors. YopM has been demonstrated to be injected into the cytoplasm of cells and translocate to the nucleus via a vesicle-associated pathway (10Skrzypek E. Cowan C. Straley S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1051-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 11Skrzypek E. Myers-Morales T. Whiteheart S.W. Straley S.C. Infect. Immun. 2003; 71: 937-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). PRK2 has been described as a cytoplasmic protein, whereas RSK1 has been demonstrated to shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus of cells. To determine whether the subcellular localization of PRK2 and RSK1 is altered through association with YopM, the localization of the kinases was examined and compared with their localization in cells expressing YopM (Fig. 2E). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were made from cells transfected with vector or FLAG-YopM, immunoprecipitated with anti-PRK2, anti-RSK1, or anti-FLAG antibodies, and visualized by Western blot. As a control for proper cell fractionation, the localization of a nuclear transcription factor, CREB, was also assessed in these extracts by Western blot. In vector-transfected as well as FLAG-YopM-transfected cells, PRK2 and RSK1 were localized primarily to the cytoplasm, with some nuclear localization as well. YopM was also detected in both cellular compartments, with the majority of the YopM protein localized in the cytoplasm. These results demonstrate that PRK2, RSK1, and YopM localize to similar cellular locations, and association of the kinases with YopM does not redirect their localization. In order to characterize further the protein interactions in the YopM complex, truncated kinase constructs were tested for their ability to co-immunoprecipitate with YopM (Fig. 3). The PRK2 domain structure contains three homologous repeat (HR1) regions in the amino terminus, followed by a central repeat region similar to the pseudosubstrate site of protein kinase C kinases (HR2), an SH3 domain-binding PXXP motif, and a carboxyl-terminal serine/threonine kinase domain (26Palmer R.H. Ridden J. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 344-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). PRK2 deletion constructs were constructed in-frame with an amino-terminal GST tag and transfected into cells with FLAG-YopM. YopM complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and Western-blotted with anti-GST antibody (Fig.3A). YopM co-immunoprecipitated GST-PRK2 constructs containing the carboxyl-terminal amino acids 512–985 (Δ512N) and 648–985 (Δ648N). A weak interaction was also detected between YopM and GST-PRK2 amino acids 331–651 with long exposures. These results indicate that the major region of PRK2 required for interaction with YopM is between amino acids 648 and 985 which encompasses the kinase domain of PRK2. The RSK1 domain structure consists of two distinct kinase domains separated by a linker region. Deletion constructs of RSK1 were constructed in-frame with an amino-terminal HA tag. The HA-RSK1 expression constructs were co-transfected into cells with FLAG-YopM, followed by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody (Fig. 3B). FLAG-YopM was able to co-immunoprecipitate full-length HA-RSK1 (FL) and the HA-RSK1 construct composed of amino acids 1–423 (Δ423C). Further truncation of HA-RSK1 abolished co-immunoprecipitation with YopM. These results suggest that interaction of RSK1 and YopM requires the presence of the linker region between the dual kinase domains of RSK1. We have demonstrated that YopM forms a complex with two cellular kinases, PRK2 and RSK1. In vitro kinase assays were performed to determine the effect of complex formation on the kinase activity of PRK2 and RSK1 (Fig.4). Endogenous kinases were immunoprecipitated from vector-transfected or cells transfected with FLAG-YopM and used in an in vitro kinase assay with [γ-32P]ATP and myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate. As both RSK1 and PRK2 kinase activity is increased in cells grown in serum, transfected cells were serum-starved for 16 h prior to immunoprecipitation with rabbit IgG (c), anti-PRK2, anti-RSK1, or anti-Akt antibodies (Fig. 4A). The ability of both PRK2 and RSK1 to phosphorylate MBP was increased when YopM was expressed in cells. The kinase activity of Akt, a kinase not found in the YopM complex, was not affected by the expression of YopM. These results suggest that expression of YopM specifically activates PRK2 and RSK1. The relative amounts of YopM expression required to activate PRK2 and RSK1 were investigated by in vitro kinase assays from cells transfected with increasing amounts of FLAG-YopM plasmid. Cells used for assessing PRK2 kinase activity were transfected with 0–5 μg of FLAG-YopM, whereas cells used in the RSK1 assays were transfected with 0–1 μg of FLAG-YopM, with the total amount of transfected plasmid maintained at 5 μg with the addition of vector plasmid. Cells were starved for 16 h and the endogenous PRK2 and RSK1 immunoprecipitated, and activity was assessed by in vitrokinase assay (Fig. 4, B and C). Results showed a dose-dependent increase in both PRK2 and RSK1 kinase activity with increasing amounts of YopM expressed in cells. The amounts required for maximal activity of the two kinases are different, with RSK1 activated by much lower amounts of YopM expressed. These results demonstrate that the endogenous kinase activity of PRK2 and RSK1 is increased in a dose-dependent manner by YopM expressed in cells and that this activation of kinase activity is specific to two kinases that interact with YopM. The previous experiments do not differentiate whether the increase of PRK2 and RSK1 kinase activity is due to direct actions of YopM on the kinases or through stimulation of cellular pathways that lead to the activation of these kinases. To address this, recombinant YopM protein was added toin vitro kinase assays with endogenous PRK2 or RSK1 immunoprecipitated from serum-starved cells (Fig.5A). Addition of recombinant YopM increased the kinase activity of RSK1 in vitro but did not significantly affect PRK2 kinase activity. The results suggest that YopM has a direct effect on RSK1 kinase activity and that the stimulation of PRK2 activity is due to an indirect mechanism. The role of PRK2 and RSK1 kinase activities in the stimulation of the kinases by YopM was assessed using kinase-deficient mutants of PRK2 and RSK1 that contain mutations in critical lysines of their kinase domains that render them inactive (Fig. 5, B–D). In these experiments, cells were co-transfected with an EGFP-tagged YopM (EGFP-YopM), an HA-tagged RSK1 (HA-RSK, either wild-type or kinase-deficient), and a FLAG-tagged PRK2 (FLAG-PRK2, either wild-type or kinase-deficient). These cells were then serum-starved and components of the YopM complex immunoprecipitated, and kinase activity was analyzed by in vitro kinase assays. The relative contribution of PRK2 and RSK1 kinase activity to the YopM complex was assessed by in vitro kinase assays with immunoprecipitated EGFP-YopM from transfected cells (Fig.5B). In this assay, no kinase activity over control levels (lane 1) was seen in immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with both kinase-deficient PRK2 and RSK1 (lane 5), indicating that these are the only two kinase"

Expression Constructs—To generate various EGFP-tagged βPIX constructs, the following regions of βPIX were PCR amplified and subcloned into pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) using the indicated enzyme sites: full-length (aa 1–646; SalI-KpnI), SH3 (aa 1–70; EcoRI-BamHI), DH (aa 89–286; EcoRI-KpnI), PH (aa 280–417; EcoRI-BamHI), PXXP (aa 396–502; EcoRI-BamHI), GBD (aa 486–566; EcoRI-BamHI), LZ (aa 575–642; EcoRI-BamHI), ΔSH3 (aa 61–646; EcoRI-KpnI), ΔDH (aa 1–646 Δ100–279; SalI-KpnI-BamHI), ΔPH (aa 1–646 Δ287–400; SalI-KpnI-KpnI), ΔPXXP (aa 1–646 Δ407–494; SalI-KpnI-KpnI), ΔGBD (aa 1–646 Δ496–555; SalI-KpnI-KpnI), ΔLZ (aa 1–646 Δ587–639; EcoRI-KpnI-KpnI), ΔETNL (aa 1–642; EcoRI-KpnI), and Δ(LZ-ETNL) (aa 1–586; EcoRI-KpnI). EGFP-tagged full-length αPIX (aa 1–728) was subcloned into the EcoRI site of pEFGP-C1. The last seven aa of βPIX (aa 640–646) and GKAP (aa 660–666) were generated by annealing oligonucleotides and subcloning them into the KpnI-BamHI site of pEGFP-C1. The following constructs have been described: FLAG-tagged full-length GIT1 (36Premont R.T. Claing A. Vitale N. Freeman J.L. Pitcher J.A. Patton W.A. Moss J. Vaughan M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl.

GST Pull Down Assay—For pull down, the last seven aa of βPIX (wild-type and L646A mutant) were generated by annealing oligonucleotides and subcloning them into the BamHI-EcoRI site of pGEX4T-1. The PDZ domain of Shank1 (aa 584–690) was subcloned into the BamHI site of pGEX4T-1. For pull down, HEK293T cells were transfected with various βPIX constructs, GIT1, GKAP last seven aa, and Shank2. Two days after transfection, HEK293T cells were harvested and extracted by incubating with phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 (for cells transfected with various βPIX and GIT1) or with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS; for cells transfected with GKAP last seven aa and Shank2) at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with 5 μg of GST fusion proteins, or GST alone, for 30 min at room temperature, followed by precipitation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against HA (0.4 μg/ml), EGFP (1167, 1:1000), and FLAG (1 μg/ml). Preparation of PSD and Subcellular Fractions—Subcellular fractionation of rat brain was performed as described previously (37Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Adult (∼6 weeks) rat brains were homogenized in ice-cold homogenization buffer (0.32 m sucrose, 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) supplemented with protease inhibitors. After centrifuging the homogenates twice at 900 and 1000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged at 12000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was saved as the cytosolic fraction (S2). The pellet was resuspended in homogenization buffer and centrifuged at 13000 × g for 15 min to obtain the crude synaptosomal fraction (pellet, P2). PSD fractions were purified as described previously (38Cho K.O. Hunt C.A. Kennedy M.B. Neuron. 1992; 9: 929-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation Assay in Heterologous Cells and in Rat Brain—Transfected HEK293T cells were extracted with binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 or radioimmune precipitation assay buffer) and incubated with HA-agarose (Sigma) or antibodies against EGFP (1167; 4 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 90 min, followed by precipitation with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). For in vivo coimmunoprecipitation, the crude synaptosomal fraction of adult rat brain was solubilized with DOC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 9.0), dialyzed against binding/dialysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), and centrifuged. The supernatant was incubated with βPIX (1254; 7 μg/ml) antibody, Shank (3856; 10 μg/ml) antibody, or rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml; negative control) for 2 h and then with protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. The precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against EGFP (1167; 1:1000), HA (0.4 μg/ml), βPIX (1254; 0.2 μg/ml or 1257; 1 μg/ml), Shank (3856; 1:2000), GIT1 (du139; 1:2000), PAK (1 μg/ml), vinculin (1:1000), and p130Cas (1:1000). Immunohistochemistry on Rat Brain Sections—Adult rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and brain sections (50 μm) were cut using a vibratome. Brain sections were permeabilized by incubation in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50% ethanol at room temperature for 30 min. For immunofluorescence staining, brain sections were incubated with βPIX (1254; 1 μg/ml) antibodies overnight at room temperature, followed by Cy3-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 2 h at room temperature. Images were captured using a LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss). Primary Neuron Culture, Transfection, and Immunocytochemistry— Cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared from embryonic (E18) rat brain as described (39Goslin K. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. The MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1991Google Scholar). Disassociated neurons were placed in neurobasal medium supplemented with B27, 0.5 mm l-glutamine, 12.5 μm glutamate, and penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen) for 3 h and grown in fresh medium without glutamate. Low density cultures were used for colocalization studies. At 21 days in vitro (DIV), hippocampal neurons were fixed and permeabilized with precooled methanol at -20 °C for 15 min and incubated with primary antibodies against βPIX (1254; 1 μg/ml), Shank (1123; 1:150), synaptophysin (1:200), MAP2 (1:500), neurofilament-H (1:500), and PAK (10 μg/ml), followed by Cy3- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies. Neurons were transfected at DIV 19 using a mammalian transfection kit (Invitrogen) and stained at DIV 21 using the same method used for colocalization experiments. Image Acquisition and Analysis—Images were analyzed blind using MetaMorph image analysis software (Universal Imaging). The parameter settings were kept constant for all scans. Transfected neurons were chosen randomly for quantitation from immunostained coverslips from two to three independent experiments. Synaptic areas were defined as discrete Shank-positive regions. For each neuron studied, the synaptic targeting of βPIX was determined by measuring the average fluorescence intensity of βPIX in 10 individual synaptic areas per neuron. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test. N numbers refer to the number of neurons quantified. Interaction between Shank and βPIX in Vitro—We reported recently (40Ko J. Kim S. Valtschanoff J.G. Shin H. Lee J.R. Sheng M. Premont R.T. Weinberg R.J. Kim E. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1667-1677Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that βPIX is enriched in the PSD and associates with the GIT-liprin-α-GRIP complex that is involved in the regulation of synaptic targeting of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid glutamate receptors. We noticed that the C terminus of βPIX ends with Asp-Glu-Thr-Asn-Leu (DETNL), a sequence that fits to the class I PDZ-binding consensus (41Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar) and closely mimics that of GKAP/SAPAP (QTRL), a family of proteins that interact with Shank (42Kim E. Naisbitt S. Hsueh Y.P. Rao A. Rothschild A. Craig A.M. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 43Takeuchi M. Hata Y. Hirao K. Toyoda A. Irie M. Takai Y. J. Biol.

Akiyama T. Genes Cells. 1997; 2: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). When tested for binding to various PDZ domains in a yeast two-hybrid assay, the C terminus of βPIX interacted with the PDZ domains from the Shank family proteins (Shank1, Shank2, and Shank3) but not with those from other proteins including PSD-95, SAP97, S-SCAM, GRIP1, and GRIP2/ABP (Fig. 1A). A point mutation of the βPIX C terminus in which the last aa, Leu-646, of βPIX was converted into Ala (DETNA) but not a conserved mutation (DQTNL) eliminated the Shank-βPIX interaction (Fig. 1B). Intriguingly mutation of the Asp residue at the -4 position to Asn (NETNL and NQTNL) eliminated the Shank-βPIX interaction (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the residues upstream of the known PDZ-binding consensus sites (in general the last three residues) are also important for PDZ recognition in the Shank-βPIX interaction. In GST pull down assay, a GST fusion protein containing the last seven residues of βPIX (GST-βPIX last seven aa) but not GST alone pulled down Shank2 expressed in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1C). However, a GST-βPIX last seven aa mutant in which the last residue Leu was changed into Ala (GST-βPIX last seven aa L646A) did not pull down Shank2. These results are consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results and indicate that the Shank-βPIX interaction is mediated by the canonical PDZ-peptide interaction. In HEK293T cell lysates doubly transfected with HA-tagged Shanks (HA-Shank1, HA-Shank2, or HA-Shank3) and EGFP-tagged βPIX (EGFP-βPIX), HA antibodies immunoprecipitated HA-Shanks and coprecipitated βPIX (Fig. 1D). HA antibodies did not bring down singly expressed βPIX. Conversely, incubation of the cell lysates doubly transfected with HA-Shank2 + EGFP-βPIX with EGFP antibodies brought down βPIX and coprecipitated HA-Shank (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that full-length Shank and βPIX form a coimmunoprecipitable complex in heterologous cells. The PIX family contains two members, αPIX and βPIX, that share similar domain structure (25Manser E. Loo T.H. Koh C.G. Zhao Z.S. Chen X.Q. Tan L. Tan I. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Like βPIX, αPIX contains an LZ domain that shares 75% aa sequence identity with the βPIX LZ domain, although αPIX does not have a PDZ-binding motif at its C terminus. However, αPIX did not coimmunoprecipitate with Shank1 (Fig. 1F), suggesting that Shank specifically interacts with βPIX but not with αPIX. The LZ Domain and the C-terminal PDZ-binding Motif of βPIX Mediate the Interaction with the PDZ Domain of Shank—Although the results mentioned above clearly suggest that the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of βPIX interacts with the PDZ domain of Shank, it is possible that other regions of Shank and βPIX may mediate the interaction. We first tested this possibility by pulling down various deletion variants of βPIX (depicted in Fig. 2A) with the GST fusion protein containing the PDZ domain of Shank1 (GST-Shank1 PDZ) (Fig. 2B). GST-Shank1 PDZ pulled down the last seven aa residues of βPIX (EGFP-βPIX last seven aa), as expected. Intriguingly, GST-Shank1 PDZ also pulled down EGFP-βPIX containing the LZ domain with a strong coiled-coil property (EGFP-βPIX LZ), suggesting that the LZ domain of βPIX also binds to the PDZ domain of Shank. In contrast, none of the other domains of βPIX (SH3, DH, PH, PXXP, and GBD) was pulled down by GST-Shank1 PDZ. Consistently, βPIX deletions lacking the LZ domain (EGFP-βPIX ΔLZ) and the last four residues (EGFP-βPIX ΔETNL) showed a significantly reduced and undetectable pull down, respectively, by GST-Shank1 PDZ. As expected, EGFP-βPIX lacking the region from the LZ domain to the C terminus (EGFP-βPIX Δ(LZ-ETNL)) was not pulled down by the Shank PDZ. In contrast, deletion of the other domains of βPIX (ΔSH3, ΔDH, ΔPH, ΔPXXP, and ΔGBD) did not affect the pull down of βPIX by the Shank PDZ. These results indicate that the LZ domain and the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of βPIX mediate its interaction with Shank. In coimmunoprecipitation assays, EGFP-βPIX LZ or EGFP-βPIX last seven aa but not other domains of βPIX formed a complex with HA-Shank1 full-length in transiently transfected HEK293T cells (Fig. 3A). Consistently, EGFP-βPIX ΔLZ and EGFP-βPIX ΔETNL showed reduced coimmunoprecipitation with Shank (Fig. 3B), and EGFP-βPIX Δ(LZ-ETNL) completely lost its Shank binding. In contrast, deletion of the other domains in βPIX (ΔSH3, ΔDH, ΔPH, ΔPXXP, and ΔGBD) did not affect the coimmunoprecipitation of βPIX with Shank. The small but significant coimmunoprecipitation observed in EGFP-βPIX ΔETNL (Fig. 3B) contrasts with the complete loss of its interaction with the Shank PDZ in the pull down assay (Fig. 2B). This could be because of the fact that the Shank constructs used in the two assays were different; the PDZ domain and the full-length were used in the pull down and coimmunoprecipitation assays, respectively. Indeed, EGFP-βPIX ΔETNL failed to coimmunoprecipitate with HA-Shank1 PDZ (data not shown), although further details remain to be determined. Taken together, these results, summarized in Fig. 2A, further confirm that the LZ domain and the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif of βPIX mediate its interaction with Shank. Conversely, in HEK293T cells cotransfected with EGFP-βPIX full-length and HA-Shank1B deletion variants (depicted in Fig. 4A), all of the HA-Shank deletion variants containing the PDZ domain coimmunoprecipitated with βPIX (Fig. 4B). In contrast, Shank deletions lacking the PDZ domain did not show any detectable coimmunoprecipitation with βPIX. These results, summarized in Fig. 4A, suggest that the PDZ domain of Shank is the major determinant of βPIX binding. Spatiotemporal Expression of βPIX and Its Association with Shank in Rat Brain—To study βPIX in vivo, in particular its spatiotemporal expression and the association with Shank, we generated polyclonal antibodies against βPIX (rabbit 1254 and guinea pig 1257) using a H6 fusion protein containing the second half (aa 294–646) of βPIX as immunogen.

To investigate the mechanisms by which endothelial cells regulate cadherin cell surface levels, a VE-cadherin mutant containing the non-adhesive interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor extracellular domain and the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail (IL-2R-VE-cadcyto) was expressed in microvascular endothelial cells. Expression of the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant resulted in the internalization of endogenous VE-cadherin and in a dramatic decrease in endogenous VE-cadherin levels. The internalized VE-cadherin co-localized with early endosomes, and the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine dramatically inhibited the down-regulation of VE-cadherin in cells expressing the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant. Chloroquine treatment also resulted in the accumulation of a VE-cadherin fragment lacking the β-catenin binding domain of the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail. The formation of the VE-cadherin fragment could be prevented by treating endothelial cells with proteasome inhibitors. Furthermore, inhibition of the proteasome prevented VE-cadherin internalization and inhibited the disruption of endothelial intercellular junctions by the IL-2RVE-cadcyto mutant. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of VE-cadherin processing and degradation in microvascular endothelial cells.

These results provide new insights into the mechanisms of VE-cadherin processing and degradation in microvascular endothelial cells. Endothelial adherens junctions are adhesive intercellular contacts that are crucial for the maintenance and regulation of normal microvascular function (1Stevens T. Garcia J.G. Shasby D.M. Bhattacharya J. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L419-L422Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Dejana E. Spagnuolo R. Bazzoni G. Thromb.

Alterations in adherens junction assembly influence endothelial cell motility, vascular morphogenesis, and permeability. Moreover, recent studies indicate that components of adherens junctions also function in intracellular signaling, leading to the current view that these complexes are plasma membrane domains that integrate chemical and mechanical signaling information (4Gottardi C.J. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R792-R794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The major cell-cell adhesion molecule at endothelial adherens junctions is VE-cadherin, a cadherin family member that is specifically expressed in endothelial cells (5Breviario F. Caveda L. Corada M. Martin-Padura I. Navarro P. Golay J. Introna M. Gulino D. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 1229-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of the classic cadherins, including VE-cadherin, comprises two well-characterized domains. The juxtamembrane domain (JMD) 1The abbreviations used are: JMD, juxtamembrane domain; CBD, catenin binding domain; IL-2, interleukin-2; IL-2R, IL-2 receptor; MECs, microvascular endothelial cells; CMV, cytomegalovirus; EEA-1, early endosome antigen-1; Ab, antibody; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ECD, extracellular domain; ICD, intracellular domain; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase; PECAM-1, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1. binds to the catenin p120, an armadillo family protein that is thought to regulate cadherin adhesive interactions by modulating the activity of Rho family GTPases (6Anastasiadis P.Z.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). At the carboxyl-terminal region of the cadherin cytoplasmic tail, a domain termed the catenin binding domain (CBD) interacts with β-catenin or plakoglobin (9Angst B.D. Marcozzi C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 629-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Catenin and plakoglobin both interact with α-catenin, which links cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton and to other actin-binding proteins such as α-actinin (10Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Knudsen K.A. Wheelock M.J. J.

A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). VE-cadherin also associates with the vimentin cytoskeletal network in endothelial cells through interactions with plakoglobin and the intermediate filament-binding protein desmoplakin (14Kowalczyk A.P. Navarro P. Dejana E. Bornslaeger E.A. Green K.J. Kopp D.S. Borgwardt J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3045-3057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These unique intercellular junctions, containing both actin and vimentin-binding proteins, have been referred to as complexus adhaerentes (15Schmelz M. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 274-289PubMed Google Scholar, 16Schmelz M. Moll R. Kuhn C. Franke W.W. Differentiation. 1994; 57: 97-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 17Valiron O. Chevier V. Usson Y. Breviario F. Job D. Dejana E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2141-2149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although our understanding of the mechanisms of junction assembly has advanced significantly, much less is known about how cellular levels of cadherins are regulated. The loss of cadherin expression in epithelial cells is associated with a variety of pathologies, including tumor metastasis (18Christofori G. Semb H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 73-76Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar), and changes in cadherin expression are associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transitions during development (19Miller J.R. McClay D.R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 323-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Interestingly, initiation of endothelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation was found to correlate with the disruption of cell-cell contacts and has been marked by a loss of VE-cadherin expression in endothelial monolayers (20Frid M.G. Kale V.A. Stenmark K.R. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). A recent study (21Bobryshev Y.V. Cherian S.M. Inder S.J. Lord R.S. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 43: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) found that down-regulation of VE-cadherin in intimal neovessels was closely related to intimal inflammation. These data suggest that regulated changes in VE-cadherin levels have important consequences on endothelial function and pathophysiology. However, the cellular mechanisms that control cadherin expression and presentation at the cell surface are poorly characterized. Some insights into these issues have come from studies in which dominant negative mutants of cadherins were expressed in epithelial cells (22Amagai M. Fujimori T. Masunaga T. Shimizu H. Nishikawa T. Shimizu N. Takeichi M. Hashimoto T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 27-32Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Fujimori T. Takeichi M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 37-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In a variety of model systems, cadherin mutants with a non-adhesive extracellular domain disrupt cell-cell adhesion (24Kintner C. Cell. 1992; 69: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and decrease cell proliferation (25Zhu A.J. Watt F.M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3013-3023Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism by which these mutants disrupt adhesion is not fully understood; however, several studies (26Norvell S.M. Green K.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1305-1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Nieman M.T. Kim J.B. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1621-1632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Troxell M.L. Chen Y.T. Cobb N. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C404-C418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have indicated that dominant negative cadherin mutants cause the down-regulation of endogenous cadherins. Using a mutant VE-cadherin in which the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin was replaced with the non-adhesive IL-2 receptor, we have observed similar effects in an endothelial model system (29Venkiteswaran K. Xiao K. Summers S. Calkins C.C. Vincent P.A. Pumiglia K. Kowalczyk A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C811-C821Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that cellular mechanisms common to a wide range of epithelial cell types control cadherin expression, and that cadherin mutants can be used to expose the molecular nature of these regulatory pathways. Recent studies indicate that some pools of cadherin on the cell surface are endocytosed and recycled back to the plasma membrane (30Le T.L. Joseph S.R. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C489-C499Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Le T.L. Yap A.S. Stow J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 219-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that cadherin endocytosis is an important regulatory mechanism that controls cadherin cell surface levels and perhaps regulates overall levels of cadherin expression. Because endogenous cadherins are down-regulated by mutant cadherins, we hypothesized that these mutants trigger the endocytosis and degradation of endogenous cadherins. This model system might therefore be used to reveal the cellular machinery involved in regulating cadherin levels in vascular endothelial cells. In the present study, we utilized an adenoviral system to introduce the dominant negative IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant into primary cultures of microvascular endothelial cells (MECs). The results of this study indicate that expression of the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant caused a rapid and dramatic down-regulation of endogenous VE-cadherin. Furthermore, the mutant triggered the internalization of endogenous VE-cadherin, which was subsequently processed through the endosomal-lysosomal pathway. Lysosomal inhibitors prevented VE-cadherin degradation and revealed the formation of a VE-cadherin fragment that is generated during endocytic processing. The internalization and fragmentation of VE-cadherin could be blocked using proteasome inhibitors, suggesting a role for the proteasome in cadherin processing. Together, these observations provide new insights into the mechanisms by which cell surface levels of cadherins are regulated in microvascular endothelial cells. Cell Culture—Primary cultures of dermal microvascular endothelial cells (MECs) from human neonatal foreskin were purchased from the Emory Skin Diseases Research Center (Core B) and cultured in MCDB131 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), l-glutamine (Herndon, VA), cAMP (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), hydrocortisone (Sigma), epidermal growth factor (Intergen, Purchase, NY), and antibiotic/antimycotic (Invitrogen). Cells were typically cultured 24–48 h and grown to 80% confluency for most experiments. For some experiments, MECs were seeded onto Matrigel to induce migration and branching as previously described (29Venkiteswaran K. Xiao K. Summers S. Calkins C.C. Vincent P.A. Pumiglia K. Kowalczyk A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C811-C821Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Monkey kidney cell line COS-7 and human embryonic kidney cell line QBI-293A (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin. For transient transfection experiments, a subclone of COS-7 cells (COS-7-20) was transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. Chloroquine was purchased from Sigma and used at 100 μm, and the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA) and used at 24 μg/ml. cDNA Constructs—A cDNA clone encoding full-length human VE-cadherin was generously provided by Dr. E. Dejana (32Navarro P. Caveda L. Breviario F. Mandoteanu I. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Biol.

This IL-2R construct was used to construct a chimeric cDNA with the IL-2R extracellular domain, the entire VE-cadherin cytoplasmic domain, and a carboxyl-terminal c-myc epitope tag, as described previously (29Venkiteswaran K.

A deletion mutant of the VE-cadherin cytoplasmic tail lacking the catenin binding domain of VE-cadherin was generously provided by Dr. E. Dejana (32Navarro P. Caveda L. Breviario F. Mandoteanu I. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 52: 30965-30972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A VE-cadherin entire cytoplasmic domain construct encoding the VE-cadherin extracellular and transmembrane domains with a cytoplasmic myc epitope tag was generated by PCR using Vent polymerase and the following primers: 5′-primer: 5′-ACGGGATCCGGGAAGATGCAGAGGCTCATGATGCTCCTC and the 3′-primer: 5′-GCAGTCTCGAGCTACAAGTCCTCTTCAGAAATGAGCTTTTGCTCCACCTTGCCGTGCGCGCGGGCCTGCTT. This 3′-primer includes an in-frame c-myc epitope tag followed by a stop codon. The resulting PCR product was ligated into PKS and subcloned into a CMV expression vector. All constructs were characterized fully by DNA sequence analysis, Western blot, and immunofluorescence analysis. Adenovirus Production—The pAdeasy adenovirus-packaging system, including pAdTrack-CMV and pAdeasy-1, was kindly provided by Dr. B. Vogelstein. Escherichia coli BJ5183 electroporation-competent cells were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Packaging and production of recombinant adenoviruses carrying the VE-cadherin constructs was achieved using the pAdeasy system according to published protocols (35He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were amplified using QBI-293A cells and purified using VirakitTM Adeno4 kit (Viropur, LLC, Carlsbad, CA). Infection rates in MECs were monitored using green fluorescent protein, which is expressed in tandem with the construct of interest. In all experiments infection rates of ∼80% for MEC cultures were used for all constructs. Immunofluorescence—MECs cultured on gelatin-coated glass cover-slips were rinsed in PBS+ (PBS containing Ca2+ and Mg2+) and fixed in methanol at –20 °C for 3 min. Alternatively, cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS followed by extraction in 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS+. Endogenous VE-cadherin was detected using mouse monoclonal antibody Cad-5 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); VE-cadherin mutants were followed using a rabbit antibody directed against the c-myc epitope tag (Bethyl Laboratories, Inc., Montgomery, TX). The localization of early endosomes was monitored using a mouse monoclonal EEA-1 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) or a rabbit polyclonal EEA-1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents). In some experiments, the IL-2 receptor was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody directed against the human IL-2 receptor (BioSource, Camarillo, CA). Appropriate species cross-absorbed secondary antibodies conjugated to various Alexa Fluors (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used for dual-label immunofluorescence. Control experiments were carried out routinely to verify that fluorescence was not due to secondary antibody cross-reactivity. Microscopy was carried out using a Leica DMR-E fluorescence microscope equipped with narrow band pass filters and a Hammamatsu Orca camera. Images were captured, pseudo-colored, and processed using Open Lab software (Improvision Inc., Lexington, MA). Western Blot Analysis—MECs were harvested in Laemmli gel sample buffer (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot using antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of VE-cadherin (cad-5, ECD Ab, Transduction Laboratories), the intracellular domain of VE-cadherin (ICD Ab, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), the myc epitope tag (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX), PECAM-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or vimentin (V9, Sigma). The IL-2R extracellular domain was detected using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used at 1: 3000 dilution and detected using ECL (Amersham Biosciences, England). Trypsinization Experiments—To distinguish cell surface and intracellular pools of VE-cadherin, MECs were rinsed and incubated in trypsin/EDTA at 37 °C to proteolytically remove cell surface VE-cadherin. Trypsin was subsequently inactivated using normal growth medium with serum, and cells were recovered by centrifugation. Cell pellets were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for Western blot analysis as described above. For controls, parallel cultures were harvested in SDS-PAGE sample buffer without trypsinization. VE-cadherin Mutants Induce Internalization and Down-regulation of Endogenous VE-cadherin—To investigate the early events associated with the disassembly of endothelial junctions, recombinant adenoviruses were used to express a VE-cadherin mutant in primary dermal microvascular endothelial cells (MECs). Using this adenoviral system, the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant cadherin was expressed in MECs, and the levels of endogenous VE-cadherin were evaluated over the course of 24 h after infection (Fig. 1). Expression of the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant was evident within 8 h of infection, and endogenous VE-cadherin was dramatically decreased by 12 h in MECs expressing the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant. In contrast to the IL2-R-VE-cadcyto mutant, a similar mutant with the α5 integrin cytoplasmic tail (34Pham C.G. Harpf A.E. Keller R.S. Vu H.T. Shai S.Y. Loftus J.C. Ross R.S. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2916-H2926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) did not alter VE-cadherin levels (Fig. 1C). To determine the localization of endogenous VE-cadherin in MECs expressing IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant, immunofluorescence analysis was performed at 12 h after infection with adenovirus encoding the empty vector or the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant (Fig. 2). An antibody directed against the VE-cadherin extracellular domain (cad-5) was used to specifically identify endogenous VE-cadherin and not the mutant, which lacks the VE-cadherin extracellular domain. The mutant cadherin was detected using antibodies directed against the myc epitope tag present at the carboxyl terminus. In uninfected MECs (not shown) and in control cells expressing empty adenoviral vector, extensive VE-cadherin staining was observed at MEC cell borders (Fig. 2A). In striking contrast, in MEC cultures expressing the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant, endogenous VE-cadherin was distributed in a punctate cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 2B). This punctate distribution was observed in virtually every cell expressing the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant. Expression of the IL-2R-α5cyto integrin mutant had no effect on VE-cadherin distribution (Fig. 2, C and F). To determine if the cadherin mutant was specifically altering VE-cadherin levels, the distribution and expression levels of PECAM-1 were monitored in MECs expressing the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant (Fig. 3). In MECs infected with empty virus, PECAM-1 was present at the cell surface and accumulated at intercellular junctions (Fig. 3, A and B). In MECs expressing the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant, PECAM-1 appeared more diffuse, and junctional accumulation of the protein was decreased (Fig. 3, C and D). However, the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant had no effect on PECAM-1 protein levels (Fig. 3E). Together, these data indicate that the expression of VE-cadherin was modulated specifically by the IL-2RVE-cadcyto mutant cadherin.Fig. 2The IL-2R-VE-Cadcyto mutant disrupts MECs intercellular junctions. MECs were infected with empty adenovirus (A and D), the IL-2R-VE-Cadcyto mutant (B and E), or the IL2-R-α5cyto chimeric integrin mutant (C and F) for 18 h. The cells were then fixed in methanol and processed for dual label immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against endogenous VE-cadherin (A–C), the myc epitope tag (D and E), or the IL-2 receptor extracellular domain (F).

The cells were then fixed in paraformaldehyde plus 0.5% Triton X-100 and processed for dual-label immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against PECAM-1 (B and D) and the myc epitope tag (A and C).

No punctate staining for VE-cadherin was observed in cells fixed in paraformaldehyde, but a loss of cell surface cadherin staining was observed in cells infected with adenovirus expressing the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant (Fig. 4A, asterisk). In contrast, in cells fixed in paraformaldehyde followed by permeabilization with Triton X-100, obvious VE-cadherin punctate staining was observed, indicating that the punctate VE-cadherin staining represents an internalized pool rather than cell surface clusters (Fig. 4B). These results indicate that dominant negative cadherin mutants induce internalization of endogenous VE-cadherin in primary human microvascular endothelial cells. To determine if internalized VE-cadherin is destined for the endosome-lysosome pathway, co-localization of endogenous VE-cadherin with EEA-1, a marker for early endosomes, was carried out using dual-label immunofluorescence analysis (Fig. 4, C–E). As shown in Fig. 4E, the endogenous VE-cadherin localized to cytoplasmic vesicles containing early endosome antigen-1 (EEA-1), indicating that the internalized VE-cadherin was processed through the endosomal pathway. To determine if the internalized VE-cadherin was degraded via a lysosomal pathway, uninfected MECs and MECs expressing IL-2R-VE-cadcyto were treated with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine. Interestingly, a dramatic increase in vesicular VE-cadherin staining was observed in uninfected MECs after treatment with chloroquine for 8 h (Fig. 5B), indicating that lysosomal inhibitors increase vesicular VE-cadherin accumulation even in quiescent MECs. In MECs expressing the IL-2RVE-cadcyto mutant, ∼90% of the cells expressing this mutant exhibited vesicular VE-cadherin staining even in the absence of chloroquine (Fig. 5C). Treatment of MECs expressing the mutant cadherin with chloroquine resulted in a slight increase in vesicular cadherin, and the vesicular structures were often larger in chloroquine treated cells (Fig. 5D). Together, these results suggest that, in quiescent MECs, VE-cadherin is normally internalized and degraded via a lysosomal pathway and that the expression of cadherin mutants dramatically accelerates this process. Lysosome Inhibitors Prevent VE-cadherin Degradation and Reveal the Formation of a VE-cadherin Fragment—The above results demonstrate that endogenous VE-cadherin is internalized and that the expression level of endogenous VE-cadherin is decreased upon the introduction of dominant negative cadherin mutants. Furthermore, the internalized VE-cadherin is processed through the endosome-lysosome pathway. To determine if lysosomal inhibitors could prevent the decrease in VE-cadherin levels in cells expressing the mutant cadherin, MECs that were infected with empty virus or IL-2R-VE-cadcyto were treated with chloroquine, and Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate the expression level of endogenous VE-cadherin. As shown in Fig. 6A, chloroquine treatment prevented the down-regulation of VE-cadherin in MECs expressing the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant. The regulation of VE-cadherin expression was explored further by seeding MECs onto Matrigel, which induces rapid endothelial cell migration and the formation of branching networks (29Venkiteswaran K. Xiao K. Summers S. Calkins C.C. Vincent P.A. Pumiglia K. Kowalczyk A.P. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: C811-C821Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 36Benelli R. Albini A. Int. J Biol. Markers. 1999; 14: 243-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6B, VE-cadherin levels were dramatically decreased in MECs seeded onto Matrigel for 6 h. To determine if the down-regulation of VE-cadherin in endothelial cells induced to migrate on Matrigel could be inhibited with chloroquine, MECs were allowed to adhere to Matrigel or plastic for 1 h, and then treated with chloroquine for 6 h. Similar to MECs expressing the IL-2R-VE-cadcyto mutant, chloroquine treatment attenuated the down-regulation of VE-cadherin in MECs seeded onto Matrigel. These data suggest that lysosomal degradation of VE-cadherin is used to control VE-cadherin expression in migrating endothelial cells. Surprisingly, treatment of MECs with chloroquine also resulted in the appearance of a 95-kDa VE-cadherin fragment in both control MECs, and in MECs expressing the mutant cadherin (Fig. 6A). The amount of the VE-cadherin fragment generated in chloroquine-treated cells was also increased in MECs seeded onto Matrigel compared with control cells seeded onto plastic (Fig. 6B). This VE-cadherin fragment likely represents an intermediary in the processing of VE-cadherin during endocytosis and degradation. To determine the kinetics of the appearance of the VE-cadherin fragment in chloroquine-treated cells, time course experiments were conducted on uninfected MECs. MECs were treated with chloroquine for 0–9 h, and the appearance of the fragment was monitored by Western blot using an antibody directed against the VE-cadherin extracellular domain. As shown in Fig. 6C, a steady increase in the accumulation of the VE-cadherin fragment is observed over this time frame. To determine how rapidly the fragmented VE-cadherin is subsequently processed for complete degradation, MECs were treated with chloroquine for 6 h and then transferred to normal growth medium without chloroquine for various amount of time. Three hours after the return to normal medium, the fragment was almost completely absent, indicating that the chloroquine treatment is reversible (Fig. 6D). The results of these experiments suggest that chloroquine treatment halts VE-cadherin degradation in the lysosome subsequent to an earlier cleavage of the VE-cadherin tail. Removal of chloroquine then allows the process to continue, resulting in c"

Expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), an immunosuppressive cytokine, has been correlated in vivowith Aβ accumulation in transgenic mice and recently with Aβ clearance by activated microglia. Here, we demonstrate that TGF-β1 drives the production of Aβ40/42 by astrocytes leading to Aβ production in TGF-β1 transgenic mice. First, TGF-β1 induces the overexpression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in astrocytes but not in neurons, involving a highly conserved TGF-β1-responsive element in the 5′-untranslated region (+54/+74) of the APP promoter. Second, we demonstrated an increased release of soluble APP-β which led to TGF-β1-induced Aβ generation in both murine and human astrocytes. These results demonstrate that TGF-β1 potentiates Aβ production in human astrocytes and may enhance the formation of plaques burden in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients.

In Alzheimer's disease, this amyloidogenesis can lead to the formation of amyloid deposits within the cerebral parenchyma and vascular walls (1Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Nature. 1997; 389: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Among these factors, recent reports have associated transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), a potent immunosuppressive cytokine, with AD. First, recent data suggest that a genetic polymorphism of the TGF-β1 gene may be associated with a higher risk to develop AD (9Luedecking E.K. DeKosky S.T. Mehdi H. Ganguli M. Kamboh M.I. Hum. Genet. 2000; 106: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Second, post-mortem brain tissue analyses of AD patients show an increased expression of TGF-β1 correlated with the degree of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (8Wyss-Coray T. Masliah E. Mallory M. McConlogue L. Johnson-Wood K. Lin C. Mucke L. Nature. 1997; 389: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Third, 16-month-old transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-β1 in astrocytes elicit Aβ deposition (8Wyss-Coray T. Masliah E. Mallory M. McConlogue L. Johnson-Wood K. Lin C. Mucke L. Nature. 1997; 389: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). In the same study, these authors generated biogenic mice expressing both human APP and TGF-β1. In these hAPP/TGF-β1 mice, Aβ deposits were observed after 3 months of age compared with TGF-β1 mice, suggesting that TGF-β1 would be able to influence APP metabolism or processing. In addition to its amyloidogenic effects (8Wyss-Coray T. Masliah E. Mallory M. McConlogue L. Johnson-Wood K. Lin C. Mucke L. Nature. 1997; 389: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), TGF-β1 was recently associated with Aβ clearance from the brain parenchyma to the cerebral blood vasculature in aged hAPP/TGF-β1 mice by activated microglia (10Wyss-Coray T. Lin C. Yan F., Yu, G.Q. Rohde M. McConlogue L. Masliah E. Mucke L. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 612-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Despite this dual effect of TGF-β1 in the amyloid plaque metabolism, the mechanism(s) by which TGF-β1 promotes the production of Aβ remained to be elucidated. Total RNAs were prepared using either the RNAxel extraction kit (Eurobio, Paris, France) or RNAeasy extraction columns (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). Samples (1 μg) of total mRNA were transcribed into cDNA. cDNA libraries (1 μl from 20 μl) were amplified by PCR with oligonucleotides for β-actin, APP770, APP751, and APP695 (respectively 539, 242, 222, and 401 bp of PCR products). All PCR were established in the linear range of amplification by performing multicycle amplification to reach half of the saturation curve. The β-actin oligonucleotides were: sense, 5′-GTGGGCCGCTCTAGGCACAA-3′, 25–45 bp; and antisense, 5′-CTCTTTGATGTCACGCACGATTTC-3′, 564–540 bp.

The conditions of amplification were 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C for 30 cycles, corresponding to the 50% of the saturation curve of the PCR product. Based on the PCR primers used, TGF-β expression described in Fig. 1Acorrespond to the transgene encoded TGF-β. PCR primers used for IL-1β were: sense, 5′-TGACCTGGGCTGTCCAGATG-3′; antisense, 5′-CTGTCCATTGAGGTGGAGAG-3′, 340 bp.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from control and TGF-β1-treated astrocytes and neurons. Cells were harvested 1 h after treatment and processed as described previously (14Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were end labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Binding reactions, containing 10 μg of nuclear extracts and 2 ng of labeled oligonucleotides, were performed for 20 min at 37 °C in appropriate binding buffer (14Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). The sequence of the double stranded oligonucleotide used as probe was: 5′-CGGGAGACGGCGGCGG-3′. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved in 5% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.5 × TBE. Mouse cortical cultures of neurons were prepared from 14–15-day-old embryos as described previously (15Rose K. Goldberg M.P. Choi D.W. Tyson C.A. Frazier J.M. In Vitro Biological Methods. San Diego, CA1993: 46-60Google Scholar). After 3 days in vitro, neurons were treated with 10 μm cytosine arabinoside to inhibit the proliferation of astrocytes. Experiments were realized on pure neuronal cultures (> 98% of microtubule-associated protein-2-positive cells) after 12–14 days in vitro. Murine cortical cultures of astrocytes were prepared from 1–3 day postnatal mice (15Rose K. Goldberg M.P. Choi D.W. Tyson C.A. Frazier J.M. In Vitro Biological Methods. San Diego, CA1993: 46-60Google Scholar). Experiments were performed on confluent cultured cortical astrocytes after 10 days in vitro. Primary cultures of cortical astrocytes were washed three times in PBS each 3 daysin vitro to prevent the adhesion of microglial cells onto the monolayer of astrocytes until use (10–12 days in vitro). This protocol leads to fewer than 1% of CD11b-positive cells. Primary cultures of human neurons and astrocytes were established from brain tissues of therapeutically aborted human brain fetuses after 10 weeks of gestation. The protocol for tissues so obtained complied with institutional and national guidelines. All transgenic mice were of BALB/c × SJL background and heterozygous for the respective transgene. Nontransgenic littermates served as controls. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-TGF-β1 line T65 has been generated similarly to lines 64 and 115, which have been described previously (16Wyss-Coray T. Feng L. Masliah E. Ruppe M.D. Lee H.S. Toggas S.M. Rockenstein E.M. Mucke L. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 53-67PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1.35-kb porcine TGF-β1 cDNA was inserted into the first exon of a modified mouse GFAP gene. This cDNA had been mutated to allow secreted TGF-β1 to be functional once released into the extracellular space. Homozygous TGF-β1 transgenic mice develop communicating hydrocephalus (16Wyss-Coray T. Feng L. Masliah E. Ruppe M.D. Lee H.S. Toggas S.M. Rockenstein E.M. Mucke L. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 53-67PubMed Google Scholar); however, for this study we used heterozygous TGF-β1 mice, which do not develop this complication. Identification of transgenic mice was performed by analysis of tail genomic DNA and from cerebral total RNAs. Cells were harvested in a lysis solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, with 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Equally conditioned media were harvested in the presence of 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture prior vacuum concentration (10-fold). Electrophoreses were done on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide Tris-glycine gels or 16.5% Tris-Tricine gels containing 8m urea. Gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PolyScreen®, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), membranes were blocked in nonfat milk and probed with appropriate antiserum. Blots were finally developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The monoclonal mouse antibody 22C11 (1:1,000) (Roche Applied Science) to residues 66–81 of APP695 was used to identify either membrane-bound protein or soluble derivatives. The following primary antibodies were used: R7 (1:1,000) against KPI-APP proteins (17Berkenbosch F. Refolo L.M. Friedrich Jr., V.L. Casper D. Blum M. Robakis N.K. J. Neurosci.

R1742 and R600 were generated to synthetic Aβ37–42 and Aβ1–10 and tested against synthetic Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptides (Sigma). Cultured murine cortical astrocytes were gently washed in PBS and fixed with ice-cold 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were washed, and nonantigenic sites were blocked in PBS plus 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20 (Sigma) and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody raised against GFAP in PBS, 1% BSA, and 0.1% Tween 20. Cells were then washed and incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated antibody (Molecular Probes). Thereafter, astrocytes were incubated with the OX42 monoclonal antibody as described above. The appropriate secondary biotin-conjugated antibody was used, and antibody-antigen complexes were revealed with streptavidin Alexa Fluor® 555-conjugate (Molecular Probes). Cells were finally counterstained with DAPI-containing PBS and 0.1% Tween 20. Aβ peptides were captured with a monoclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal domain of Aβ (8Wyss-Coray T.

Either recombinant rodent or human Aβs (Calbiochem) were used as controls. Mouse cortical astrocytes were exposed to 10 μg/ml actinomycin D for 0–16 h after 24-h treatment with recombinant human TGF-β1 (R&D Systems Europe) before semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. Gels were scanned and quantified by densitometry. Cells were transiently transfected with the constructs indicated using the Transfast®Transfection Reagent (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. For each transfection experiment, sister culture dishes were used to control the efficiency of transfection using an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-containing plasmid driven by cytomegalovirus promoter (pEGFP-C1 vector) (BD Biosciences-Clontech). All transfections were performed with the empty vector (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen) corresponding to the experimental plasmid used (pcDNA3.1-APPtre-luc). Transfection efficiency was determined by counting total cells and EGFP-positive astrocytes. In our hands, we reached the ratio of 71 ± 8% of transfected astrocytes. Potential toxicity was estimated by examination of the cultures under phase microscopy and quantified by measurement of the activity of the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase released by damaged cells into the bathing medium as described previously (21Koh J.Y. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1987; 20: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar). No differences were observed between untransfected and transfected cells (data not shown). Moreover, the pRL-TK values provided by the Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System did not differ from controls (data not shown). Two days after transfection, cells were treated and luciferase activities (firefly luciferase andRenilla luciferase) were evaluated after 1 day using the Dual Luciferase® Reporter Assay System (Promega). Values were normalized to the Renilla luciferase activity (Promega). The Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System refers to the simultaneous expression and measurement of two individual reporter enzymes within a single system. Typically, the “experimental” reporter (firefly luciferase) is correlated with the effect of specific experimental conditions (e.g. TGF-β1 treatment), whereas the activity of the cotransfected “control” (Renilla luciferase) reporter provides an internal control, which serves as the base line of the response. Indeed, the pRL-TK control vector contains the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter region upstream of Renilla luciferase. It provides low level and constitutive expression in transfected cells. Normalizing the activity of the experimental reporter to the activity of the internal control minimizes experimental variability caused by differences in cell toxicity, transfection efficiency and proliferation. pGL3-APPluc constructs were prepared into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) containing a major late promoter sequence (pGL3-MLP) (14Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). The −1104/+104 fragment of the Rhesus monkey APP promoter (GenBank accession number AF 067971) was provided by Dr. Lahiri (22Song W. Lahiri D.K. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 217: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The −309/+104 and the −201/+104 fragments were PCR amplified, digested byKpnI and BglII restriction enzymes, and ligated into pGL3-MLP. The −309/+104 luciferase vector was digested by XhoI and BglII restriction enzymes to obtain the −75/+104 fragment. The +54/+74 luciferase reporter vector was obtained by inserting into pGL3-MLP a double stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the +54/+74 region of the human APP promoter and flanked by two XhoI restriction sites. Agarose gels or blots from three independent experiments were acquired by a CCD camera and saved as a resolution of 600 dpi for software analysis. PCR products and Western blot signals were quantified by two-dimension densitometric analysis using the OptiQuant® software (Packard Instruments Inc.). Results are expressed as the mean ± S.D. Statistical analyses were performed with StatView (Abacus, Berkeley, CA) by one-way variance analysis (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni-Dunn test or Student's t test. To understand the role of TGF-β1 in Aβ deposition, the influence of TGF-β1 on APP and Aβ expression was investigated in 6-month-old transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-β1 (line T65) through the use of semiquantitative RT-PCR, Western blotting analysis, and Aβ ELISAs. Transgenic mice were generated by Prof. Lennart Mucke's laboratory similarly to the previously described low expressing GFAP-TGF-β1 transgenic lines, T64 and T115 (16Wyss-Coray T. Feng L. Masliah E. Ruppe M.D. Lee H.S. Toggas S.M. Rockenstein E.M. Mucke L. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 53-67PubMed Google Scholar). These mice express large amounts of the transgene associated with enhanced expression of endogenous TGF-β1 as determined either by RT-PCR (Fig.1A) or by immunoblotting (Fig.1B). In cortices of TGF-β1 mice, we observed a significant up-regulation of the mRNAs encoding APP isoforms compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1, C and D). These data were confirmed after immunoblotting performed from the same brain extracts (Fig. 1E). When revealed with 22C11 antibody, membrane-bound APP proteins were significantly overexpressed in TGF-β1 mice compared with wild-type mice (Fig. 1E). Because TGF-β1 possesses an amyloidogenic role (8Wyss-Coray T. Masliah E. Mallory M. McConlogue L. Johnson-Wood K. Lin C. Mucke L. Nature. 1997; 389: 603-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar), we determined Aβ production by ELISAs in our T65 transgenic line and observed a significant increase of soluble Aβ42 (7.41 ± 0.48 in wild-type versus 13.07 ± 1.88 pg/mg in transgenic; p = 0.04) and Aβ40 (32.91 ± 1.36 in wild-type versus 59.12 ± 3.57 pg/mg in transgenic; p = 0.01) without modifying the Aβ42:Aβ40 ratio (0.225 ± 0.06 in wild-type versus0.221 ± 0.11 in transgenic) (Fig. 1F). To determine which cell type was involved in the increased expression of APP in TGF-β1 mice, we exposed primary cultures of mouse cortical neurons or astrocytes to exogenous recombinant TGF-β1. As reported previously (23LeBlanc A.C. Chen H.Y. Autilio-Gambetti L. Gambetti P. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the three APP isoforms are expressed in astrocytes with a predominant expression of APP770 and APP751, whereas cortical neurons abundantly express APP695 mRNA but only small amounts of APP770 and APP751 mRNAs (Fig. 2,A and C). Although 1 ng/ml TGF-β1 exposure failed to modify the expression pattern of APP mRNAs in cortical neurons (Fig. 2, A andB), TGF-β1 markedly enhanced the expression of the mRNAs encoding the three isoforms of APP in astrocytes (Fig. 2,C and D). Because it could be advanced that the up-regulation of APP observed after TGF-β1 exposure could result from the secondary activation of astrocytes by proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1β released by microglia cells, we have estimated the amount of microglia in our cultures of astrocytes by performing double immunocytochemical labeling against the GFAP, an astrocytic marker, and CD11b, a specific marker of microglial cells. Less than 1% of microglial contamination in our primary cultures of cortical astrocytes was evidenced (Fig. 2E). TGF-β1 elicits its biological effects through a heteromeric complex of transmembrane serine/threonine kinase receptors, cloned as type I and type II receptors. After receptor-dependent phosphorylation, Smad2 or Smad3 interacts with the common mediator Smad4 to form a heteromeric complex that translocates to the nucleus to initiate TGF-β-dependent transcriptional activity. This complex binds DNA sequences termed Smad-binding elements that contain a minimal four-nucleotide domain AGAC also called “CAGA box” (24Massague J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (1627) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have transiently transfected astrocytes with expression vectors encoding constitutively activated versions of the TGF-β type I receptor (Alks) (25Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (3301) Google Scholar) or with an expression vector encoding the transcription factor Smad3 (Fig.3). To validate the efficiency of transfection in our system, murine cultured astrocytes were transfected with the EGFP-C1 vector encoding EGFP using cationic lipids. 24 h later, astrocytes were immunolabeled for GFAP and counterstained with DAPI before determination of transfection efficiency (∼70%) (Fig.3A). Cell viability did not differ from untransfected astrocytes as estimated by phase microscopic observation and lactate dehydrogenase activity (data not shown). Expression of either Alk-5 or Alk-4 led to an enhanced transcription of all isoforms of APP, whereas Alks linked to other members of the TGF-β superfamily did not enhance APP transcription (Fig. 3,B and C). Indeed, transfecting astrocytes with Alk-3 unexpectedly lowered APP mRNA expression. Accordingly, Smad3 overexpression potentiated APP mRNA expression (Fig. 3,D and E). As expected, overexpression of Smad7, a physiological dominant negative Smad, prevented TGF-β1-induced expression of APP in cultured astrocytes (Fig. 3, D andE). Thus, TGF-β1 signaling machinery controls APP transcription in cultured astrocytes by a Smad3-dependent mechanism. We determined whether the induction of the APP mRNAs by TGF-β1 in astrocytes was the result of a stabilization of the transcripts. In the presence of actinomycin D, the relative amount of APP and β-actin mRNAs was reduced in a time-dependent manner. The administration of TGF-β1 failed to modify the stability of APP transcripts (Fig.4A). Considering the TGF-β1-dependent overexpression of the three APP isoforms mRNAs, we investigated whether TGF-β1 modulates the activity of the APP promoter. Thus, different regions (−309/+104, −201/+104, and −75/+104) of the Rhesus monkey APP promoter were subcloned into the pGL3-basic luciferase reporter vector containing a MLP. When transfected in the mink lung epithelial cell line Mv1Lu, previously characterized as a TGF-β-responsive cell line (26Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar,27Vivien D. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Massague J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7134-7141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), these entire promoter constructs were activated by TGF-β1 treatment or Smad3 transfection (Fig. 4B). By performing sequence alignments (Fig. 4C), we noticed that a conserved sequence, located between +56 and +71 within the 5′-untranslated region, was retrieved in the cloned APP promoter from mouse, rat, Rhesus monkey, and man (5′-CGGGAGACGGCGGCGG-3′). Although the empty vector was nonresponsive to TGF-β1 treatment or Smad3 transfection, it became sensitive to TGF-β1 and Smad3 when five copies of the +54/+74 sequence of the human APP promoter (named APP TGF-β-responsive element or APPtre) were inserted (Fig. 5,A and B). Results were similar both in Mv1Lu cells (Fig. 5A) and in primary cultures of murine astrocytes (Fig. 5B). Transfection of cultured astrocytes with expression vectors encoding Alk-4 and Alk-5 resulted in a marked increase in luciferase activities confirming the necessity of TGF-β receptor activation to induce its response (Fig.5C). Moreover, overexpression of Smad7 led to 90% inhibition of TGF-β1-induced activation of the APPtre reporter construct (Fig. 5D). In MDA-MB468 cells deficient for endogenous Smad4 expression (28de Caestecker M.P. Hemmati P. Larisch-Bloch S. Ajmera R. Roberts A.B. Lechleider R.J. J. Biol.

These data demonstrates that a Smad3·Smad4 complex is necessary to mediate the TGF-β1-induced transcription of APP.Figure 5Smads proteins mediate TGF-β1-induced activation of the APPpromoter.A, mean ± S.D. of the luciferase activity of Mv1Lu cell line transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing five copies of the +54/+74 sequence of the human APP promoter inserted 5′ of the MLP luciferase reporter gene.

However, the specific protein-protein interactions that facilitate elastin polymerization have not been defined. To identify domains in the tropoelastin molecule important for the assembly process, we utilized an in vitro assembly model to map sequences within tropoelastin that facilitate its association with fibrillin-containing microfibrils in the extracellular matrix. Our results show that an essential assembly domain is located in the C-terminal region of the molecule, encoded by exons 29–36. Fine mapping studies using an exon deletion strategy and synthetic peptides identified the hydrophobic sequence in exon 30 as a major functional element in this region and suggested that the assembly process is driven by the propensity of this sequence to form β-sheet structure. Tropoelastin molecules lacking the C-terminal assembly domain expressed as transgenes in mice did not assemble nor did they interfere with assembly of full-length normal mouse elastin. In addition to providing important information about elastin assembly in general, the results of this study suggest how removal or alteration of the C terminus through stop or frameshift mutations might contribute to the elastin-related diseases supravalvular aortic stenosis and cutis laxa.

Although technical advances in cell and molecular biology have given us new information about elastin gene expression and elastin synthesis, surprisingly little is known about how the elastic fiber is assembled at the molecular level. The major component of the mature fiber is a covalently cross-linked polymer of the protein elastin. Elastin is secreted from the cell as a soluble monomer called tropoelastin. In the extracellular space, lysine residues within tropoelastin are specifically modified to form covalent cross-links between tropoelastin chains. This cross-linked polymer has a high degree of reversible distensibility, including the ability to deform to large extensions with small forces. The tropoelastin molecule is characterized by a series of tandem repeats, each including a lysine-containing cross-linking region followed by a hydrophobic motif (1Indik Z. Yeh H. Ornstein G.N. Kucich U. Abrams W. Rosenbloom J.C. Rosenbloom J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Cross-linking is initiated by the extracellular enzyme(s) lysyl oxidase, which catalyzes the oxidative deamination of lysyl ε-amino groups. Under normal conditions, the cross-linking process is extremely efficient, with all but ∼5 of the ∼40 lysine residues in tropoelastin participating in covalent linkages that form the functional polymer. How the cross-linking sites within the monomer are aligned prior to cross-linking is unclear. It has long been assumed that microfibrils provide a scaffold or template for elastin assembly by binding and aligning tropoelastin monomers so that lysine-containing regions are in register for cross-linking. This idea evolved from electron microscopic images showing that the appearance of microfibrils is the first ultrastructural indication of the elastic fiber (2Wirtschafter Z.T. Cleary E.G. Jackson D.S. Sandberg L.B. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 33: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3Ross R. Bornstein P. J.

Tissue Res. 1983; 10: 97-209Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that microfibrils are associated with elastin throughout the elastogenic period. Recently, two inherited diseases, autosomal dominant cutis laxa and supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS),1 have been linked to mutations within the elastin gene that may alter the ability of the elastin precursor to undergo normal assembly (5Milewicz D.M. Urbán Z. Boyd C.D. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Tassabehji M. Metcalfe K. Hurst J. Ashcroft G.S. Kielty C. Wilmot C. Donnai D. Read A.P. Jones C.J.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Each of these diseases has a distinct clinical phenotype and may be caused by fundamentally different molecular mechanisms. Autosomal dominant cutis laxa is characterized by redundant, loose, sagging, and inelastic skin with variable systemic organ involvement. The known elastin mutations in autosomal dominant cutis laxa are single nucleotide deletions in exons 30 and 32 that, depending on exon splicing, give rise to a missense peptide sequence extending into the 3′-untranslated region (6Tassabehji M.

Although the exact pathomechanism of this disease is not clear, it is thought that alterations at the C terminus of the secreted mutant protein interfere with the deposition of normal elastin in a dominant-negative fashion (5Milewicz D.M. Urbán Z. Boyd C.D. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 6Tassabehji M. Metcalfe K. Hurst J. Ashcroft G.S. Kielty C. Wilmot C. Donnai D. Read A.P. Jones C.J.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1021-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). SVAS is characterized by thickening of the arterial wall and either focal or diffuse narrowing of the aorta and, frequently, of other major arteries. Mutational analysis has identified a wide spectrum of mutations associated with SVAS, including large deletions, translocations, inversions, and, most frequently, point mutations (8Curran M.E.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the pathomechanism of SVAS is haploinsufficiency (13Urbán Z. Zhang J. Davis E.C. Maeda G.K. Kumar A. Stalker H. Belmont J.W. Boyd C.D. Wallace M.R. Hum.

The objective of this study was to better characterize elastic fiber assembly and to identify the domains on the tropoelastin molecule that mediate this process. We were also interested in determining whether proteins from transcripts with SVAS-like mutations are capable of incorporating into elastic fibers and, if so, whether they interfere with normal fiber function. Using an in vitro model system of fiber assembly together with expression of tropoelastin constructs in transgenic mice, we provide evidence for a critical assembly domain located in the region between exons 29 and 36 that mediates the interaction of tropoelastin with microfibrils in the extracellular matrix. Studies with synthetic peptides and tropoelastin deletion constructs suggest that the hydrophobic sequence encoded by exon 30 is a major functional element in this region. These findings also provide an explanation for how SVAS mutations could lead to haploinsufficiency when the truncated product of the mutant allele is secreted without this critical assembly domain. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise noted. The antibody used to detect bovine elastin inin vitro experiments with pigmented epithelial (PE) cells is a polyclonal antibody generated against recombinantly produced human tropoelastin. The only exception occurred in experiments in which matrices were probed concurrently for tropoelastin and fibrillin-1. In those experiments, BA4, a monoclonal antibody reactive against bovine tropoelastin (14Grosso L.E. Scott M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13369-13374Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and Fib-1 CT, a polyclonal antibody generated against the recombinant FBN1 C-terminal domain (15Ritty T.M. Broekelmann T. Tisdale C. Milewicz D.M. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8933-8940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), were used. Tissue immunofluorescence studies made use of BA4 and anti-mouse recombinant tropoelastin antibody N6–17, a polyclonal antibody generated against recombinantly produced murine tropoelastin exons 6–17. BA4 will detect bovine and human elastin, but does not interact with mouse tropoelastin. In addition, CTe, a polyclonal antibody directed against a folded peptide encoded by exon 36 of bovine elastin (16Brown-Augsburger P.B. Broekelmann T. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), was used in Western blotting to probe for proteolytic fragments containing the tropoelastin C terminus. The transfection constructs used for this study were derived from a full-length bovine cDNA that has been previously characterized (17Robb B.W. Wachi H. Schaub T. Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3595-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). It carries a deletion of exons 13 and 14. When attempts were made to amplify the missing exons from cultured fetal bovine chondrocytes using RT-PCR, cDNA containing the exons could not be identified, suggesting that the Δ13–14 form is the dominant transcript in these elastogenic cells. Numbering associated with deletion constructs refers to sequences encoded by the exons that make up the bovine tropoelastin cDNA. To generate the full-length transfection construct, bovine tropoelastin cDNA was cloned into the MluI-XbaI site of the pCIneo vector (Promega). Construction of the 1–28 truncation was achieved by PCR amplification of the appropriate exons from the full-length cDNA. The forward primer contains anMluI site and the ATG from exon 1, whereas the reverse primer contains a stop site and the XbaI restriction site for cloning. Primer sequences are as follows: exon 1F, 5′-GCACGCGTATGCGGAGTCTGACGGCTCGG-3′; and exon 28R, 5′-GCTCTAGAGTCATGCCACACCACCTGGAATGCC-3′. Generation of the remaining constructs required a pCIneo vector lacking the manufacturer-providedNotI site (pCIneo*). This was generated by cutting the vector with NotI and filling the resultant linearized vector with Klenow fragment, followed by self-ligation. Full-length tropoelastin was then cloned into the pCIneo* vector at theXbaI site (FL*). Only one NotI site is present in FL*, located at the beginning of exon 29. To generate the truncation constructs 1–29 and Δ36, PCR products were amplified using the exon 27F primer (5′-CCCTGGCCGCAGCTAAAGCAGCCAAGTTCG-3′) and the exon 29R primer (5′-GCTCTAGAGTCAAAATTGGGCTTTGGCGGCA-3′) or the exon 35R primer (5′-GCTCTAGAGTCAAAATTGGGCTTTGGCGGCA-3′). The reverse primers contain both the stop site for the molecule and anXbaI site for cloning purposes. After amplification, FL* and the PCR products were cut with NotI and XbaI and ligated to one another. Similarly, the ΔRKRK construct (representing the deletion of the last 4 amino acids from the molecule) was generated by amplification using the above exon 27F primer and the ΔRKRK-R primer that deletes these C-terminal amino acids (5′-GCTCTAGAGAAAATTGGGCTTTGGCGGCA-3′). This product was also cut withNotI and XbaI and inserted into the similarly cleaved FL* vector. The internal deletion Δ33 was constructed by RT-PCR amplification of total RNA isolated from fetal bovine ligament cells. Fetal bovine ligament cells are known to express an alternatively spliced form of tropoelastin in which exon 33 has been spliced out (1Indik Z. Yeh H. Ornstein G.N. Kucich U. Abrams W. Rosenbloom J.C. Rosenbloom J. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1989; 34: 81-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The PCR primers used for the amplifications include the exon 27F primer as well as the exon 36R primer that leads to amplification of the entire 36th exon as well as its stop codon (5′-GCTCTAGAGTCACTTTCTCTTCCGGCCACA-3′). The product of the amplification was then cleaved with NotI and XbaI and ligated into the FL* vector cut with the same enzymes. To generate the Cys-to-Ala mutations, oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with oligonucleotides C755A-F (5′-TGGGGAAATCCGCTGGCCGGAAGAG-3′) and C755A-R (5′-CTCTTCCGGCCAGCGGATTTCCCCA-3′) and oligonucleotides C751A-F (5′-CCAGGTGGGGCCGCCCTGG-3′) and C751A-R (5′-ATTCCCCACCGCGGCCCCACCTGG-3′) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Several steps were required to generate construct Δ30. First, exons 28–36 were amplified by PCR. The primers used were exon 28F (5′-GGAATTCAGATCTTGGTGGAGCCG-3′) and the exon 36R primer listed above. The exon 28F primer contains an EcoRI site such that the product can be digested with EcoRI andXbaI and ligated into a similarly digested pUC-19 shuttle vector (pUC-28–36). To generate the Δ30 insert, exon 30 was deleted by PCR amplification of a 113-bp fragment using the exon 28F primer and the exon 29/31R primer (5′-AACTGCAGCTGGAGACACACCAAATTGGGCGGCTTTGGCGGC-3′) encoding a PstI site in exon 31. TheEcoRI-PstI-restricted fragment was ligated into the similarly digested pUC-28–36 plasmid, resulting in the pUCΔ30 plasmid. pUCΔ30 was then digested with NotI andXbaI, and the bTEΔ30 insert was ligated into theNotI-XbaI-restricted FL* plasmid, resulting in pCIneo-bTEΔ30. All alterations were verified by nucleotide sequencing. PE cells (20Coca-Prados M. Wax M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro) supplemented with nonessential amino acids (Cellgro), sodium pyruvate (Cellgro), penicillin/streptomycin (Washington University Tissue Culture Supply Center), and 10% cosmic calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). Cells were maintained in a 37 °C humidifying CO2 incubator. Stable transfection of PE cells was performed using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 2 × 105 cells were plated in a six-well plate. When cells reached 60–80% confluence, 1 μg of the chosen construct and 1 μl of reagent complex were added to the cells in Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen). Sixteen hours later, the transfection reagents were removed, and fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% cosmic calf serum was added. After 48 h, cells were then placed under selection with 500 μg/ml active Geneticin (G418 sulfate, Invitrogen). To detect bovine tropoelastin in the matrix of stable pools of G418-selected PE cells, the cells were plated on glass coverslips in six-well plates and allowed to reach confluence. Seven days after visual confluence, the medium was removed, and the cell layer was washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times to remove all non-cell layer-associated proteins. Cells were then fixed with ice-cold methanol for 60 s and washed with PBS to remove any remaining alcohol. The cells were treated with blocking solution consisting of PBS containing 1% gelatin and 0.1% Tween 20. The anti-human recombinant tropoelastin antibody was used at a dilution of 1:250 in blocking solution. Fluorescent secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit 488, Molecular Probes, Inc.) was used at a concentration of 1:2000 in blocking solution. After secondary antibody incubation, the cells were washed before removal from the six-well plate and inversion of the coverslip onto a glass slide. Fluorescence was protected using anti-fade mounting medium (Gelmount, Biomedia Corp.). A Zeiss Axioscope microscope was used for fluorescence microscopy, and the images were captured on an Axiocam digital camera using Axiovision software. All images are shown at magnification ×40 except where noted. Conditioned media from confluent monolayers of fetal bovine chondrocytes, untransfected PE cells, and stably transfected PE cells that were metabolically labeled withl-[4,5-3H]leucine (1 mCi/ml; ICN Pharmaceuticals, Irvine, CA) were immunoprecipitated for tropoelastin as described previously (19Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were pelleted, washed, and resuspended in 35 μl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol. Samples were electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, fixed, treated with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for 1 h, dried, and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Animals were generated expressing either full-length bTE or bTE-(1–28). To generate the full-length bTE and bTE-(1–28) vectors, the pCIneo constructs described above were linearized, yielding two constructs that contained all of the pCIneo vector components in addition to the appropriate tropoelastin sequence. To generate construct Δ30, the pCIneo construct was linearized, and extraneous plasmid sequences (neo cassette, etc.) were removed by restriction digestion with ClaI. In all cases, the appropriate fragment was purified using a QIAGEN gel extraction kit. Each linearized product contained, at a minimum, the tropoelastin sequence flanked by the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter and the SV40-derived 3′-untranslated region and poly(A) signal. Each fragment was resuspended at 2 μg/ml in injection buffer composed of 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.25 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), and 5 mm NaCl and was injected into B6C3/F1 mouse fertilized eggs, which were implanted into the uteruses of pseudopregnant foster mothers. After birth, potential founders were screened for the presence of the transgene using PCR and bovine tropoelastin-specific forward (5′-GGGGTACCAGGAGCTGTTCC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCTTGGGCTTGACTCCTGCTC-3′) primers. Once detected, animals positive for the transgene were mated to wild-type animals to stabilize the line. RNA was isolated from wild-type and transgenic animals using RNAzol (Tissue Tek) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Heart, lung, kidney, and liver total RNAs were screened in all founders tested. RT-PCR was performed on 1 μg of each resultant RNA under the following conditions. Residual DNA was removed by treating the RNA with RQ1 RNase-free DNase in first-strand RT reaction buffer (Invitrogen) containing 2 μl of 0.1 mdithiothreitol for 30 min at 37 °C. The enzyme was heat-inactivated at 72 °C for 10 min. Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions in the presence of dNP6 random primers (Roche Applied Science) and dNTPs (Promega). PCR was then performed on the resultant cDNA with bovine tropoelastin-specific forward (5′-GGAATTGGAGCCATTCCCACATTTGGG-3′) and reverse (5′-GAGCCACGCCGACTCCAGG-3′) primers. Thirty-five cycles of amplification were performed with a 67 °C annealing temperature and a 30-s extension time. The products of this reaction were then analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Tissues from transgenic and wild-type animals were dissected and washed with sterile PBS before being embedded in blocks containing OCT freezing medium (Tissue Tek). The tissues were then frozen over dry ice, and 10-μm sections were cut using a microtome. For immunofluorescence analysis, sections were thawed to room temperature, fixed in cold ethanol, and etched to enhance antigenicity with 1 mg/ml hyaluronidase in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5) containing 0.85% NaCl for 30 min at 37 °C. After hyaluronidase treatment, the tissues were treated as described above for tissue culture cells. The antibodies used were BA4 and N6–17. Both were used at a 1:500 dilution. Goat anti-mouse 594 and goat anti-rabbit 488 secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc.) were used for primary antibody detection. A peptide encoding exon 30 of bovine tropoelastin (GLGGVGGLGVGGLGAVPGAVGLG) was synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using a 431 A peptide synthesizer (ABI) running Fast-Moc chemistry and dissolved at 10 mg/ml in 7 mguanidine HCl. A second, scrambled version (LVGGGGGGLPVLGGAGALGGVGV) was also synthesized as a control for this assay. The peptide stock solution (10 μl) was diluted with 200 μl of PBS and 200 μl of water and subjected to slow rotation overnight at room temperature. Precipitated peptide was pelleted by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge, smeared on a glass slide, fixed in 95% ethanol, and stained with 0.05% Congo red in 50% glycerol. Evaluation of Congo red staining by polarization microscopy was performed using a Zeiss Axioscope equipped with optimally aligned cross-polarizers. For electron microscopy, freshly prepared mica flakes were added to solutions containing peptide filaments, followed by freeze-drying and platinum replication according to established procedures (18Heuser J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 155-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 19Hanson P.I. Roth R. Morisaki H. Jahn R. Heuser J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 523-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). Full-length bovine tropoelastin was cloned into the pQE vector (QIAGEN Inc.), expressed in bacteria, and purified with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bound protein was then eluted with 6 m urea buffer (pH 4.0) and dialyzed in 0.1% acetic acid. Protein concentration was quantified by amino acid analysis, and aliquots of 200 μg were lyophilized. Aliquots (200 μg) of recombinant tropoelastin were resuspended in 350 μl of PBS containing the protease inhibitors EDTA (1 mm) and pepstatin (1 mm) to block proteolysis by non-trypsin-type proteases. A sample was taken prior to the addition of plasmin at time 0. Then, 1 μl of 0.2 μg/ml plasmin was added, and 50-μl samples were taken at 30, 60, and 120 min. Plasmin activity was stopped by adding 1× SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 0.1 mdithiothreitol and boiling for 5 min. The sample was electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schüll). Nitrocellulose blots were blocked in 5% (w/v) nonfat milk in 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 171 mm NaCl, and 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TTBS). The CTe primary antibody (18Heuser J.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 155-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:250 in TTBS containing 2.5% (w/v) nonfat milk and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was then washed and incubated with peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:2000. Chemiluminescence detection was performed using ECL Western blot detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed to XAR-5 x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). To determine which regions of tropoelastin are necessary for its association with the extracellular matrix, we generated expression constructs consisting of full-length elastin as well as mutant and deletion forms of the molecule. These constructs were then transfected into PE cells, and the ability of the expressed transgene to associate with microfibrils in the PE cell matrix was determined by immunofluorescence microscopy. PE cells are a cell line derived from the pigmented epithelial cells in the ciliary body of the bovine eye (20Coca-Prados M. Wax M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8754-8758Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). They are known to lay down an elaborate fibrillar matrix composed of fibrillin-1, fibrillin-2, and MAGP1 (microfibril-associatedglycoprotein-1), but do not produce endogenous elastin (17Robb B.W. Wachi H. Schaub T. Mecham R.P. Davis E.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3595-3605Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because these cells produce all of the components necessary to form the scaffolding for elastic matrices, but not tropoelastin itself, they provide a useful system for studying the early stages of elastic fiber assembly. After stable transfection of PE cells with the full-length bovine tropoelastin construct, microfibrils in the PE cell matrix became decorated with elastin expressed from the transgene (Fig.1). In this experiment, elastin was detected using the anti-human recombinant tropoelastin antibody, which has been shown to cross-react with the bovine protein. As expected, untransfected cells did not contain elastin in their extracellular matrix (Fig. 2A). Because earlier studies had suggested that the C terminus of tropoelastin contains a critical assembly site (16Brown-Augsburger P.B. Broekelmann T. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), our truncation and mutation constructions focused on this region. Exon 36 encodes a conserved sequence that contains the molecule's only 2 Cys residues and a terminal Arg-Lys-Arg-Lys sequence. The cysteine residues have been shown to form a disulfide-bonded loop structure that creates a highly charged “pocket” at the end of the molecule believed to facilitate interactions between tropoelastin and highly acidic microfibrils. It was an antibody to this exon 36 sequence that disrupted elastin fiber assembly in studies by Brown-Augsburger et al. (16Brown-Augsburger P.B. Broekelmann T. Rosenbloom J. Mecham R.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To assess the importance of this region of the protein to elastin assembly, we generated tropoelastin constructs in which first one and then both of the cysteines residues were mutated to alanines, as well as one construct in which the Arg-Lys-Arg-Lys sequence was deleted. A fourth construct in which exon 36 was deleted in its entirety (Δ36) was also generated. Interestingly, protein from all of the mutant constructs localized to the fibrillar matrix of PE cells (Fig.2C), indicating that the sequence encoded by exon 36 is not required for the initial association of tropoelastin with microfibrils.Figure 2Immunostaining of elastin in the extracellular matrix of PE cells transfected with bovine tropoelastin constructs. Various mutation and deletion tropoelastin cDNA constructs were transfected into PE cells, and their ability to be deposited into the extracellular matrix was assessed by immunofluorescence microscopy. A schematic of the various constructs used for transfection of PE cells is shown. The presence (+) or absence (−) of the transgenic protein in the extracellular matrix is indicated, as is minimal incorporation of tropoelastin (+/−).A–F show PE cells stained with the anti-human recombinant tropoelastin antibody. A–D and F are shown at magnification ×40, whereas E is ×10. Untransfected PE cells contained no elastin in their extracellular matrix (A). PE cells were transfected with full-length (FL) bovine tropoelastin (B), full-length bovine tropoelastin containing the C751A (CtoA) mutation affecting intrachain disulfide bonds encoded by exon 36 (C), exons 1–30 of bovine tropoelastin (D), exons 1–29 of bovine tropoelastin (E), and exons 1–28 of bovine tropoelastin (F). All constructs with the exception of 1–28 and 1–29 were incorporated into the extracellular matrix of PE cells. bTE-(1–28) was absent from the matrix, whereas bTE-(1–29) was minimally incorporated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next assayed a series of C-terminal truncations that systematically deleted ind"

To detect gastric proteins that serve as VacA receptors, we used VacA co-immunoprecipitation techniques following biotinylation of the cell surface and identified p250, a receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatase β (RPTPβ) as a VacA-binding protein (Yahiro, K., Niidome, T., Kimura, M., Hatakeyama, T., Aoyagi, H., Kurazono, H., Imagawa, K., Wada, A., Moss, J., and Hirayama, T. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36693–36699). VacA causes vacuolation of G401 cells, a human kidney tumor cell line, although they do not express RPTPβ. By co-immunoprecipitation with VacA, we identified p140 as a potential receptor in those cells. p140 purified by chromatography on a peanut agglutinin affinity matrix contained internal amino acid sequences of RGEENTDYVNASFIDGYRQK and AEGILDVFQTVK, which are identical to those in RPTPα. The peptide mass fingerprinting of p140 by time of flight-MS analysis also supported this identification. Treatment of G401 cells with RPTPα-morpholino antisense oligonucleotide before exposure to toxin inhibited vacuolation. These data suggest that RPTPα acts as a receptor for VacA in G401 cells.

Persistent infection with Helicobacter pylori causes chronic active gastritis, which predisposes the mucosa to peptic ulceration, and is believed to participate in the pathogenesis of gastric carcinoma and primary gastric lymphoma (i.e. mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, or MALT type) (1Del Giudice G.

Oral administration of VacA to mice caused acute inflammation of the gastric mucosa with accumulation of mast cells, the activation of which by VacA resulted in production of proinflammatory cytokines (8Supajatura V.

Intense infiltration of granulocytes and lymphocytes was observed following mast cell activation, consistent with the hypothesis that mast cells contribute to the gastric inflammation in H. pylori-infected peptic gastritis and ulceration (9Nakajima S.

Purified VacA has a molecular mass of 87–95 kDa under denaturating conditions, whereas the native toxin is an oligomeric complex of about 1000 kDa (10Manetti R. Massari P. Burroni D. de Bernard M. Marchini A. Olivieri R. Papini E. Montecucco C. Rappuoli R. Telford J.L. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4476-4480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). VacA proved to be capable of directly inducing progressive vacuolation (11Leunk R.D. Johnson P.T. David B.C. Kraft W.G. Morgan D.R. J. Med.

Rudi J. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 5080-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Although the detailed mechanism of its toxic activity is still unknown, bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase proton pump, can inhibit VacA-induced vacuolation. It did not, however, block mitochondrial damage by VacA (12Kimura M. Goto S. Wada A. Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Hirayama T. Kondo T. Microbiol. Pathog. 1999; 26: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In addition, a mutant VacA lacking vacuolating activity induced an apoptosis of AGS cells (14Kuck D. Kolmerer B. Iking-Konert C.

These results led to the current model in which the mitochondrial damage occurs via a pathway different from vacuolation induced by VacA, possibly through the formation of pores or selective anion channels in endosomal membranes (15Czajkowsky D.M.

In addition to RPTPβ, other proteins of lesser abundance on the surface of AZ-521 cells were also immunoprecipitated with anti-VacA antibody (23Yahiro K. Niidome T. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H.

G401 cells, although responsive to VacA, do not express RPTPβ. Here we report purification of another VacA receptor, p140, and its identification as the receptor-like tyrosine phosphatase α, RPTPα, a ubiquitously expressed protein (24Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, RPTPα and RPTPβ, two receptor-like protein-tyrosine phosphatases that differ widely in structure, can both serve as VacA receptors. Cell Culture—G401, Wilms' human kidney tumor cells (ATCC CRL-1441), and COS-7 cells were grown in DMEM (Sigma) containing 10% FCS. AZ-521 cells were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium (Sigma) containing 10% FCS. HL-60 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium with 20 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to stimulate differentiation into macrophage-like cells (22Padilla P.I. Wada A. Yahiro K. Kimura M. Niidome T.

VacA Preparation—The toxin-producing H. pylori strain ATCC49503 was used as the source of VacA for purification according to a modification of our published procedure (23Yahiro K. Niidome T.

In brief, after growth of H. pylori in Brucella broth containing 0.1% β-cyclodextran at 37 °C for 3–4 days with vigorous shaking in a controlled microaerophilic atmosphere of 10% O2 and 10% CO2, VacA was precipitated from culture supernatant with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate and purified by affinity column chromatography. Ammonium sulfate precipitates were dialyzed against RX buffer (10 mm KCl, 0.3 mm NaCl, 0.35 mm MgCl2, and 0.125 mm EGTA in 1 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and applied to an anti-VacA-specific IgG antibody column (10 mg of IgG/2 mg of dried resin) equilibrated with RX buffer. After washing the column with RX buffer, VacA was eluted with 50 mm glycine-HCl buffer (pH 1.0), which was subsequently neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 10). After gel filtration on Superose 6HR 10/30 equilibrated with TBS buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.7, containing 0.1 m NaCl), purified VacA was concentrated and stored (200 μg/ml). Immunoprecipitation of p140 —Immunoprecipitation of VacA receptors was performed as previously described (21Yahiro K. Niidome T. Kimura M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Imagawa K. Wada A. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36693-36699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In brief, G401 cells were harvested in TNE buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA), and washed twice with PBS. After biotinylation of surface proteins (Amersham Biosciences; ECL protein biotinylation module, RPN2002), cells were lysed for 15 min on ice with 1 ml of Sol buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 μg of leupeptin, 1% Triton X-100). After centrifugation (20 min, 15,000 × g), the supernatant (300 μl) was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 0.5 μg of native VacA or heat-inactivated VacA, followed by storage at 4 °C overnight with 1 μl of an antibody raised against purified VacA. Antibody-bound proteins were collected after addition of 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), 0.1 g/ml in Sol buffer, and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h. After beads were washed three times with Sol buffer, proteins were solubilized by heating in 5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 200 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6% SDS, 32% glycerol, 8% dithiothreitol, and 0.32% bromphenol blue. After SDS-PAGE in 5% gels, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore; Immobilon-P membranes). The blots were incubated with avidin-HRP (1:2000; Amersham Biosciences). Biotinylated proteins were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Biosciences). Proteins were detected using an anti-human RPTPβ mouse monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY). RNase A Protection Assay—RNA quantification was performed using the Ribonuclease Protection Assay kit (RPAIII; Ambion) as previously described (22Padilla P.I. Wada A. Yahiro K. Kimura M. Niidome T.

Briefly, 20 μg of total RNA from G401 cells, positive control cells such as AZ-521 cells, and HL60 cells treated with 20 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 48 h were used in the RNase A protection assay (22Padilla P.I.

Total RNA was hybridized overnight with RPTPβ and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase probes in hybridization buffer at 42 °C, followed by treatment with RNase, which was then inactivated. Protected fragments were separated in 5% sequencing gels, and quantified by Fuji film autoradiography. Sizes of protected fragments were 230 nucleotides for RPTPβ and 184 nucleotides for glycer-aldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Assay for Vacuolating Activity—Vacuolating activity was assessed using AZ-521 or G401 cells as previously described (21Yahiro K. Niidome T. Kimura M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Imagawa K.

Cells (1 × 105 cells/well, 250 μl) were grown in 24-well culture plates as monolayers for 24 h in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. VacA was added and cells were incubated for an additional 8 h at 37 °C. To quantify the vacuolating activity, the uptake of neutral red into the vacuoles was determined as described previously (21Yahiro K. Niidome T. Kimura M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H.

Glycosidase Treatment—After biotinylation of proteins on the surface, G401 cells were lysed in 1 ml of Sol buffer for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation (20 min, 15,000 × g), 10 μl of each supernatant (1 μg/ml) was added to a mixture of 34.5 μlof20mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 μl of N-glycosidase F (0.1 unit), neuraminidase (0.1 unit), heparitinase (0.5 unit), or chondroitinase ABC (0.5 unit), followed by incubation for 3 h, and immunoprecipitation with anti-VacA after addition of native VacA or a heat-inactivated VacA. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE in 5% gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. Flow Cytometric Analysis—AZ-521 or G401 cells (1 × 107) were harvested in TNE buffer, washed twice in PBS, and suspended in 1 ml of PBS containing 2% BSA. Samples (90 μl) were treated with neuraminidase (0.1 unit) for the indicated times. After two washes with PBS containing 2% BSA, cells (1 × 105/90 μl) were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 10 μl (1 μg) of VacA or PBS as a control. Cells were washed twice with 500 μl of PBS containing 2% BSA, followed by addition of anti-VacA antibody and incubation at 4 °C for 30 min. After two washes with PBS containing 2% BSA, cells were suspended in 400 μl of the same solution containing Fluoro LinkTM CyTM2-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400) (Amersham Biosciences) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. After cells were washed twice with the same PBS buffer, samples of 10,000 cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Pharmingen immunocytometry system) with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 530 nm. Neuraminidase Treatment—AZ-521 or G401 cells (5 × 105) were harvested in TNE buffer, washed twice in PBS, suspended in 90 μl of PBS containing 2% BSA, followed by addition of 10 μl (0.1 unit) of neuraminidase, and incubation for 1 h at 37 °C. Samples were then washed twice with PBS containing 2% BSA. Cells were suspended in 300 μl of PBS containing 2% BSA and incubated with 120 nm VacA at 4 °C for 30 min, before washing twice with 500 μl of PBS containing 2% BSA and addition of 300 μl of DMEM containing 10% FCS. Samples (100 μl) were incubated in 96-well plates for 3 h at 37 °C and vacuolating activity was quantified by NRU assay. Characterization of Carbohydrate Moieties of p140 —Specific binding of lectins was used to identify carbohydrate moieties of p140 from G401 cells, according to the manufacturer's specifications (Roche Diagnostics; DIG glycan differentiation kit) as previously described (21Yahiro K. Niidome T. Kimura M. Hatakeyama T. Aoyagi H. Kurazono H. Imagawa K. Wada A. Moss J. Hirayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36693-36699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The lectins selectively recognize terminal sugars; MAA and PNA recognize sialic acid terminally linked α(2–3) to galactose and galactose-β-(1–3)-N-acetylgalactosamine, respectively. PVDF membranes with proteins that had been separated by SDS-PAGE after immunoprecipitation were incubated at 25 °C for 1 h with lectin conjugated to the steroid hapten digoxigenin. After washing the membrane, glycoproteins were incubated with anti-digoxigenin Fab fragments conjugated with alkaline phosphatase, followed by detection with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. Purification and Identification of p140 —To examine binding of p140 to PNA-agarose (5 ml bed volume), biotinylated G401 cells (1 × 108, from ten 10-cm dishes) were washed twice with PBS, and suspended in 10 ml of Sol buffer without Triton X-100. After sonification, cells were centrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min at 15,000 × g, and the precipitated fractions were lysed in 10 ml of Sol buffer for 15 min on ice. After centrifugation (20 min, 15,000 × g), the supernatant was filtered and the filtrate (9.5 ml) was applied to a PNA-agarose column (Seikagaku) (5 ml of bed volume). The column was washed with 25 ml of Sol buffer, and then Sol buffer containing 0.3 m d-galactose was used to elute the carbohydrate-containing proteins in 1-ml fractions. After SDS-PAGE in 5% gels, proteins in effluents were transferred to PVDF membranes, followed by incubation with avidin-HRP. Biotinylated p140 was detected using enhanced ECL. To purify p140, G401 cells (1.6 × 109) were harvested from 160 10-cm dishes with TNE buffer, washed twice with PBS, and suspended in 80 ml of Sol buffer without Triton X-100. After sonification, cell lysate was applied to a PNA-agarose column (5 ml of bed volume) using the same method described for purification of biotinylated p140. The column was washed with 25 ml of Sol buffer, followed by elution of carbohydrate-containing proteins with 0.3 m d-galactose in Sol buffer. Fractions (1 ml) in which p140 were detected by immunoprecipitation using VacA and anti-VacA antibody were pooled. Proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, washed five times with ice-cold acetone, and dried. Samples (5 μg) were solubilized by heating in 50 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated in 5% gels, which were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The stained p140 band was cut from the gels, digested with Achromobacter protease I (Wako Pure Chemical Institutes, Japan), and subjected to peptide sequence analysis (21Yahiro K. Niidome T.

Expression and Identification of RPTPα—cDNA for human RPTPα in a pcDNA3.1 vector (purchased from Invitrogen) has a V5 epitope at the C terminus. COS-7 cells were plated 24 h before transfection using GenePorter transfection reagent (Gene Therapy System) following the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection, cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 h, harvested in TNE buffer, washed with ice-cold PBS buffer, lysed in Sol buffer, and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 0.5 μg of native or heat-inactivated VacA. The mixtures were then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 1 μl of an antibody raised against purified VacA. After addition of 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences), 0.1 g/ml in Sol buffer, and incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, beads were washed three times with Sol buffer. Bound proteins were solubilized by heating in 5 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE in 5% gels, and transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore; Immobilon-P membrane). Blots were incubated with HRP-conjugated anti-V5 monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen), which recognizes the 14-amino acid (GKPIPNPLLGLDST) sequence of V5 (26Southern J.A. Young D.F. Heaney F. Baumgartner W.K. Randall R.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1991; 72: 1551-1557Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and proteins were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Transfection of G401 Cells with RPTPα-morpholino Antisense Oligonucleotide—RPTPα-morpholino antisense oligonucleotide (5′-GAACAAGAATGAACCAGGAATCCAT-3′) was designed and purchased from Gene Tools, LLC (Philomath, Oregon). G401 cells were seeded in 24-well culture plates (5 × 104 cells in 1 ml of DMEM per well) and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The gene delivery agent EPEI and 1.4 μm RPTPα-morpholino antisense oligonucleotide were incubated in 500 μl of FCS-free DMEM for 20 min at room temperature before addition to G401 cells in 24-well plates, followed by incubation for 3 h at 37 °C. After the culture medium was replaced with 500 μl of DMEM containing 10% FCS, cells were incubated for 16 h. Vacuolation of cells caused by incubation with 120 nm VacA for 0, 2, and 4 h was quantified by NRU. Internalization Assay—Internalization of VacA into the cells was quantified using VacA labeled with sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, 25 μl of 1 m sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) was added to 500 μl (100 μg in PBS) of VacA followed by addition of 10 μl (10 μg) of sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin and incubated on ice for 2 h. After addition of 465 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and dialysis against PBS, VacA-SS-biotin was stored (100 μg/ml). After G401 cells (5 × 104 cells/166 μl) were transfected with or without 1.4 μm RPTPα-morpholino antisense oligonucleotide in 96-well plates, the culture medium was replaced with 90 μl of DMEM containing 10% FCS cells and then incubated with 10 μl (1 μg) of VacA-SS-biotin for the indicated times at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and fixed with 0.25% glutaraldehyde for 20 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS, and biotin was cleaved from the surface VacA with 0.5 m MES (Sigma). The internalized VacA labeled with biotin was protected from MES cleavage. After washing twice with PBS, cells were incubated with 50 μl of PBS containing 1% Triton X-100, washed twice with PBS, blocked with PBS containing 3% BSA, and incubated with avidin-HRP (1:500; Amersham Pharmacia) in PBS containing 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed four times with PBS containing 3% BSA, and incubated with 50 μl of soluble 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (BM Blue POD substrate; Roche Diagnostics) for 20 min until the reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 1 m H2SO4. Internalized VacA was detected at A415 nm. Other Methods and Chemicals—Protein was measured by the method of Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216391) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. N-Glycosidase F was purchased from Roche Diagnostics. Sialic acid derivatives such as 3′-sialyllactosamine (NeuNAc-α(2–3)-Gal-β(1–4)-GlcNAc), 6′-sialyllactosamine (NeuNAc-α(2–6)-Gal-β(1–4)-GlcNAc), heparitinase, and chondroitinase ABC were from Seikagaku Co., Tokyo. Neuraminidase was from Roche Diagnostics. Other reagents were of analytical grade. Identification of p140 on G401 Cells—The Wilms' tumor cell line G401 was susceptible to VacA intoxication (Fig. 1). In Western blot analysis using anti-RPTPβ antibody, RPTPβ was, however, not detected in G401 cell lysates; the lack of RPTPβ expression in G401 cells was confirmed by RNase protection assays (Fig. 2A). Thus, G401 cells did not express RPTPβ protein or mRNA as suggested by Qi et al. (28Qi M. Ikematsu S. Maeda N. Ichihara-Tanaka K. Sakuma S. Noda M. Muramatsu T. Kadomatsu K. J. Biol.

A 140-kDa protein on the surface of G401 cells, however, was immunoprecipitated with anti-VacA antibody and protein A-Sepharose CL-4B after incubating the cell lysate with VacA, but not with inactivated VacA (Fig. 2B). These results were consistent with the hypothesis that not only RPTPβ, but also p140, can be a functional VacA receptor and led us to use G401 cells for purification of p140.Fig. 2Immunoprecipitation of VacA-binding proteins and RPTPβ mRNA in AZ-521 and G401 cells.A, RNase protection assay of RPTPβ mRNA. RNA fragments protected from RNase were determined in AZ-521 cells (lane 1), G401 cells (lane 2), and HL60 cells treated with 20 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 48 h (lane 3) after electrophoresis in 5% polyacrylamide, 8 m urea gels and autoradiography (22Padilla P.I.

Membrane proteins of AZ-521 (B) and G401 (C) cells were biotinylated, solubilized, incubated with heat-inactivated VacA (I) or native VacA (A), and immunoprecipitated with anti-VacA antibody. Antibody-bound proteins were collected by addition of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to PVDF membranes, which were incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin, followed by ECL detection. Positions of molecular mass standards (kDa) are indicated and arrows show the location of p250 (RPTPβ) and p140 (upper panel).

After incubation with glycosidases, biotinylated p140 on G401 cells was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-VacA antibodies after incubation with native VacA or heat-inactivated VacA (Fig. 4A). The samples immunoprecipitated via their association with native VacA before (Fig. 4a, lane 2) and after (Fig. 4a, lane 4) N-glycosidase F treatment contained 140- and 135-kDa proteins, respectively. No significant change in molecular size of p140 was observed after treatment with chondroitinase ABC, or heparitinase. As shown in lane 8 (Fig. 4b), neuraminidase treatment inhibited p140 binding to VacA, an effect confirmed by flow cytometric analysis of VacA binding to G401 cells treated with neuraminidase (Fig. 5). Treatment of G401 cells with neuraminidase before incubation with VacA decreased fluorescence intensity to control levels. In addition, two kinds of sialyllactosamine with terminal sialic acids, 3′-sialyllactosamine and 6′-sialyllactosamine, did not interfere with VacA bi"
https://openalex.org/W2017230219,"The <i>SAS2</i> gene is involved in transcriptional silencing in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Based on its primary sequence, the Sas2 protein is predicted to be a member of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases (HATs). Sas2 forms a complex with Sas4 and Sas5, which are required for its silencing function. Here we show that recombinant Sas2 has HAT activity that absolutely requires Sas4 and is stimulated by Sas5. The recombinant SAS complex acetylates H4 lysine 16 and H3 lysine 14. Furthermore, a purified SAS complex from yeast shows similar activity and specificity. In contrast to other MYST HATs, neither the recombinant nor the native SAS complex acetylated nucleosomal histones under conditions that were optimum for acetylating free histones. Finally, although the SAS subunits interact genetically and physically with Asf1, a histone deposition factor, association of H3 and H4 with Asf1 blocks their acetylation by the SAS complex, raising the possibility that the SAS HAT complex may acetylate free histones prior to their deposition onto DNA by Asf1 or CAF-I."

To date, genetic methodologies have effected only minor switches in the mammalian cardiac myosin isoforms. Using cardiac-specific transgenesis, we have now obtained major myosin isoform shifts and/or replacements. Clusters of non-identical amino acids are found in functionally important regions, i.e. the surface loops 1 and 2, suggesting that these structures may regulate isoform-specific characteristics. Loop 1 alters filament sliding velocity, whereas Loop 2 modulates actin-activated ATPase rate in Dictyostelium myosin, but this remains untested in mammalian cardiac myosins. α → औ isoform switches were engineered into mouse hearts via transgenesis. To assess the structural basis of isoform diversity, chimeric myosins in which the sequences of either Loop 1+Loop 2 or Loop 2 of α-myosin were exchanged for those of औ-myosin were expressed in vivo. 2-fold differences in filament sliding velocity and ATPase activity were found between the two isoforms. Filament sliding velocity of the Loop 1+Loop 2 chimera and the ATPase activities of both loop chimeras were not significantly different compared with α-myosin. In mouse cardiac isoforms, myosin functionality does not depend on Loop 1 or Loop 2 sequences and must lie partially in other non-homologous residues.

Filament sliding velocity of the Loop 1+Loop 2 chimera and the ATPase activities of both loop chimeras were not significantly different compared with α-myosin. In mouse cardiac isoforms, myosin functionality does not depend on Loop 1 or Loop 2 sequences and must lie partially in other non-homologous residues. myosin heavy chain human growth hormone Loop 1 Loop 2 non-transgenic muscle lengths per second transgenic propylthiouracil untranslated region Myosin, the molecular motor of the heart, generates force and motion by coupling its ATPase activity to its cyclic interaction with actin. Myosin is a hexameric protein and is composed of two heavy chains (MHC)1 and two essential and two regulatory myosin light chains. Structurally, MHC is composed of a number of discrete domains: a helical rod necessary for thick filament formation, and a globular head that contains the actin-binding site, catalytic, and motor domains (1Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). In the mammalian heart, two functionally distinct MHC isoforms, termed V1 and V3, are present. V1 is a homodimer of two α-MHC molecules, whereas V3 is a औऔ-homodimer. Expression of V1 and V3 is controlled both developmentally and hormonally. In the mouse, औ-MHC expression in the ventricles predominates prenatally. However, via thyroid hormone regulation, औ-MHC expression is silenced at birth, and α-MHC is transcribed (2Morkin E. Circulation. 1993; 87: 1451-1460Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The functional differences between V1 and V3 myosin in terms of shortening velocity, force generation, and ATPase activity are profound. For example, rabbit V1 myosin has a 2–3-fold faster actin filament sliding velocity than V3, but generates only half the average isometric force (3Harris D.E. Work S.S. Wright R.K. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 4Palmiter K.A. Tyska M.J. Dupuis D.E. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 519: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Likewise, both the Ca2+-stimulated and actin-activated ATPase activities of rabbit V1 myosin are ∼2–3 times greater than for V3 myosin (3Harris D.E. Work S.S. Wright R.K. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1994; 15: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 5Litten 3rd, R.Z. Martin B.J. Low R.B. Alpert N.R. Circ. Res. 1982; 50: 856-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Similar differences in actin velocity and myofibrillar ATPase activity have been observed between mouse V1 and V3 myosin, but there is no difference in their average force generation (6Alpert N.R. Brosseau C. Federico A. Krenz M. Robbins J. Warshaw D.M. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H1446-H1454Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Although the proteins are functionally distinct, the primary amino acid sequences of mouse α- and औ-MHC are 937 identical. Thus cardiac isoform diversity must lie in the non-identical residues (127 of 1938 amino acids in mice). The differences in the enzyme kinetics and mechanics of the myosin interactions that are observed between the two cardiac isoforms are believed to reside in two, hypervariable “loops,” so called because their structures cannot be defined via x-ray crystallography due to their relative disorder. Loop 1 (L1), which is located between residues 213 and 223, is at the mouth of the nucleotide pocket while Loop 2 (L2), at positions 624–646, cradles the long cleft running from the actin binding site to the nucleotide binding pocket (1Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar, 7Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2000; 21: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Comparison of MHC sequences within the human sarcomeric MHC family shows that these domains of sequence variability are conserved (8Weiss A. Schiaffino S. Leinwand L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 290: 61-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Spudich and co-workers (9Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 10Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6738-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Uyeda T.Q. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) have proposed that Loop 1 modulates velocity through ADP release, whereas Loop 2 helps regulate the actin-activated ATPase rate. Data obtained from studies with chimeric Dictyosteliumand smooth muscle myosins corroborated the model. For example, chimeras were constructed in which 9 amino acids in the L2 region ofDictyostelium myosin II were substituted with the corresponding residues from other myosins such as rabbit skeletal muscle myosin, chicken smooth muscle myosin, or rat cardiac myosin (11Uyeda T.Q. Ruppel K.M. Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 368: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The actin-activated ATPase activities of the chimeras correlated well with the activities of the myosin from which the Loop 2 sequence was derived. Thus, myosin's ATPase activity could be specifically modulated depending on the sequence of Loop 2. However, a number of studies indicate that the loops may not influence myosin kinetics and mechanics as proposed and thus have varying roles depending on the structure of the myosin backbone. Rat and pig औ-MHC, which have identical Loop 1 sequences apart from a single conservative substitution, have 3–4-fold differences in ATPase activity and ADP dissociation (12Pereira J.S. Pavlov D. Nili M. Greaser M. Homsher E. Moss R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4409-4415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Sweeney et al. (13Sweeney H.L. Rosenfeld S.S. Brown F. Faust L. Smith J. Xing J. Stein L.A. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6262-6270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) showed that the properties of Loop 1 chimeras with a smooth muscle backbone are a function of loop size/flexibility rather than related to the properties of the myosin from which Loop 1 was derived. Furthermore, chimeric myosins that consisted of a Dictyostelium MHC backbone with carp loop sequences did not exhibit changes in sliding velocity if Loop 1 was substituted, although Loop 2 substitution did lead to the expected modulation of actin-activated ATPase activity (14Hirayama Y. Sutoh K. Watabe S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that the role of the surface loops for MHC functionality depends on the interplay of the surface loops with other regions important for myosin mechanics and kinetics. In contrast to the abundance of detailed studies on in vitrofunction of various MHC isoforms, our current knowledge of how differences found on the single molecule level are reflected inin vivo cardiac function is limited. Cardiac isoform shifts can be achieved by endocrine intervention but hypothyroidism not only results in a nearly complete V1 → V3 shift in rodent hearts, it also induces a number of structural changes including mitochondrial swelling, as well as rupture and loss of continuity of the myofilaments (15Lopes A.C. Furlanetto R. Sasso W.S. Didio L.J. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1993; 25: 263-266PubMed Google Scholar). Thus one cannot dissect MHC isoform shift induced functional changes from contractile impairment due to structural damage. Transgenesis avoids these issues. To date, only a single transgenic study has dealt directly with cardiac myosin isoform substitution, showing that contractile function of TG mouse hearts with low-level expression of Myc-tagged rat औ-MHC was reduced by 157 (16Tardiff J.C. Hewett T.E. Factor S.M. Vikstrom K.L. Robbins J. Leinwand L.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2000; 278: H412-H419Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This disproportionate impairment of contractile function might be due to the presence of a heterologous species (rat) cDNA being placed into the mouse context, resulting in a dominant negative effect of the TG protein. The present study is the first to investigate directly the functional significance of cardiac isoform diversity by using TG mice in which ventricular V1 is largely replaced by V3. This approach has the advantage of effecting isoform replacement in the heart without the pleiotropic stimuli that are normally used to induce MHC isoform transitions, such as pressure-overload induced hypertrophy or changes in hormonal status (17Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3037-3046Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 18Imamura S. Matsuoka R. Hiratsuka E. Kimura M. Nakanishi T. Nishikawa T. Furutani Y. Takao A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: H73-H79PubMed Google Scholar). A significant V1→ V3 shift resulted in the expected changes in the heart at the single motor and biochemical levels as well as in fiber mechanics and kinetics. However, in contrast to a hypothyroidism-effected replacement, cellular structure appeared normal and whole organ function was preserved with relatively minor effects on systolic and diastolic hemodynamics in the intact animal. Furthermore, we generated transgenic (TG) mice in which we substituted the sequences of Loop 1 and/or Loop 2 of mouse α-MHC with the respective sequences of औ-MHC and assessed the mechanical and enzymatic characteristics of the chimeric MHCs. These experiments were designed to test whether a sequence substitution in the Loop 1 and/or Loop 2 region is sufficient to confer औ-like activity to the α-MHC molecule. Complete replacement of the endogenous α-MHC protein with the chimeric myosin resulted in surprisingly minor differences in enzyme kinetics indicating that, for these cardiac isoforms, other variable regions or residues must play a predominant role in determining overall ATPase activity and velocity of shortening. TG mice expressing full-length mouse औ-MHC were generated. औ-MHC cDNA was produced using a combination of a cDNA containing the 3′ one-third of the RNA (19Sanchez A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Doetschman T. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22419-22426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and RT-PCR with औ-MHC-specific primers (GenBankTMaccession number AY056464). The product contained the entire औ-MHC cDNA and was linked to the mouse α-MHC promoter (Fig. 1A). Multiple TG founders (FVB/N) were generated. Line 102 with the highest degree of MHC replacement (∼407) was bred to homozygosity resulting in 737 replacement of α- with औ-MHC (Fig.1D). Neither the heterozygous or homozygous TG animals showed an overt phenotype, and all animals had a normal life span. To shift isoform expression in non-transgenic (NTG) hearts from α- to औ-MHC, adult mice received an iodine-deficient diet containing 0.157 propylthiouracil (PTU) for 8 weeks. Chimeric myosins in which either only the sequence of L2 or of both Loop 1 and Loop 2 (L1+L2) of α-MHC was exchanged for the respective sequence of औ-MHC were subsequently constructed. A diagram of the TG constructs for the chimeric MHCs is shown in Fig. 5A. Constructs for L2, and L1+L2 chimeric MHC were made using standard PCR methodology. Inner sets of oligonucleotides were designed so that the overlap encoded the amino acids that form Loop 1 or Loop 2 of the औ-isoform (Fig. 5B). Fragments generated by PCR amplification were cloned back into full-length α-MHC and placed into the mouse α-MHC promoter cassette (20Subramaniam A. Gulick J. Neumann J. Knotts S. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4331-4336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the DNA was excised free of plasmid sequence and used to generate multiple TG founders (FVB/N). Hearts were fixed in 47 paraformaldehyde. 3–4-ॖm cryostat sections were probed with a custom-made anti-Loop 2 (औ-L2) polyclonal antibody (Genemed Synthesis Inc., San Francisco, CA) followed by incubation with Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibody and co-labeled with phalloidin-Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Specimens were examined using confocal microscopy. MHC was purified from individual mouse hearts (21Tyska M.J. Hayes E. Giewat M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Warshaw D.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). F-actin was prepared from acetone powder of chicken pectoralis muscle according to a protocol modified from Pardee and Spudich (22Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Actin-activated ATPase activity was measured at actin concentrations ranging from 10 to 80 ॖm (21Tyska M.J. Hayes E. Giewat M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. Warshaw D.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 737-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Ca2+-stimulated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myofibrillar preparations from ventricular tissue (23McAuliffe J.J. Gao L.Z. Solaro R.J. Circ.

Physiol. 1995; 268: C1348-C1353Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transcript analysis was performed with RNA blots with transcript-specific probes as described previously (19Sanchez A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Doetschman T. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22419-22426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two cardiac myosins were separated on denaturing gels in the presence of glycerol, essentially as described by Reiser and co-workers (25Blough E.R. Rennie E.R. Zhang F. Reiser P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 26Reiser P.J. Kline W.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1048-H1053PubMed Google Scholar). Fiber isolation and their analyses have been described in detail (27Sanbe A. Gulick J. Fewell J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32682-32686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The in vitro motility assays (28Nguyen T.T. Hayes E. Mulieri L.A. Leavitt B.J. ter Keurs H.E. Alpert N.R. Warshaw D.M. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and determination of cardiac hemodynamics in the isolated working heart model and the closed chest intact mouse model were carried out as described (29Lorenz J.N. Robbins J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: H1137-H1146PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gulick J. Hewett T.E. Klevitsky R. Buck S.H. Moss R.L. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). All data are expressed as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between NTG and TG littermates were evaluated using Student's t test, and a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. To understand the functional consequences of MHC isoform shifts in the heart we used transgenesis to effect an α → औ shift. A cDNA encoding the mouse औ-MHC cDNA was produced using a combination of a cDNA that encoded the 3′-terminal one-third of the RNA (19Sanchez A. Jones W.K. Gulick J. Doetschman T. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22419-22426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and RT-PCR with औ-MHC-specific primers. In our hands, for unknown reasons, the औ-MHC cDNA full-length clone was difficult to isolate, and, upon bi-directional sequencing, numerous errors were apparent, particularly in the PCR-derived portion of the molecule even though a “proof-reading” enzyme was used. Each error was repaired using site-directed mutagenesis. Multiple clones of the final construct were sequenced in order to exclude any remaining PCR-induced errors and, in comparison to both the rat and human clones, a consensus sequence for the murine औ-MHC was derived (GenBankTMaccession number AY056464). α-MHC is expressed in both the mouse atria and ventricles in post-birth animals, and so the cDNA was placed into the α-MHC promoter cassette, which contains the full-length α-MHC promoter upstream of the single cloning site, and a human growth hormone polyadenylation signal (hGH) downstream (Fig. 1A). In order to confirm that the transcript was the correct size, a Northern blot was made using RNAs derived from each of the lines ventricles, and hybridized against a myosin cDNA probe. All TG lines showed only a single RNA species, which comigrated along with the endogenous MHC RNA (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, the levels of expression were quantitated using oligonucleotide probes hybridized to RNA dot blots. Probes specific to either the α-MHC 3′-UTR (which is contained within the transgene, Fig. 1A) or an oligonucleotide specific for hGH were used. Both probes gave consistent results with respect to the lines' relative expression to one another, while the α-MHC probe enabled us to determine the degree of overexpression. For each of the 5 lines tested, TG transcript levels were quite modest, ranging from 1.7 to 3.0-fold with respect to the endogenous message (Fig. 1C). These levels were relatively low compared with those that are sometimes observed when other contractile proteins were overexpressed using transgenesis (27Sanbe A. Gulick J. Fewell J. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32682-32686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 31Fewell J.G. Hewett T.E. Sanbe A. Klevitsky R. Hayes E. Warshaw D. Maughan D. Robbins J. J. Clin.

Transgenic Res. 1999; 8: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, we have noted in other related studies that high copy numbers and high levels of MHC expression (>12-fold overexpression) can be lethal, presumably because of the relatively insoluble nature of the intact protein. TG mice were analyzed for ventricular MHC protein content at 10–12 weeks. The α- and औ-MHC proteins can be separated on 57 glycerol gels (Fig.1D). Hypothyroidism resulting from PTU treatment resulted in nearly complete replacement (907) of α- with औ-MHC. Our previous contractile protein-based TG studies showed that the cardiomyocyte rigidly controls the overall stoichiometry of the contractile protein pool, such that TG overexpression at the mRNA level does not lead to increases of overall protein content (30Gulick J. Hewett T.E. Klevitsky R. Buck S.H. Moss R.L. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 32James J. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Kimball T. Klevitsky R. Witt S.

Res. 1996; 78: 504-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). That is, there is no “overexpression.” The steady state levels of endogenous protein are down-regulated and replaced proportionally by the TG protein. Therefore, we could achieve partial or even complete replacement of the endogenous MHC with TG proteins. When the highest expressing line (Line 102) was bred to homozygosity, 737 of the total MHC was औ-MHC (Fig.1D). We reasoned that if a phenotype were likely to be present, it would be most easily detected in line 102, and this line became the focus of our analyses. Immunohistochemical staining using a V3-specific antibody derived from the hypervariable Loop 2 region of औ-MHC (Fig.5B) showed only traces of this isoform in NTG ventricles (Fig. 2A). Confocal analysis confirmed that the PTU-treated animals showed significant accumulation of औ-MHC (Fig. 2B), but the characteristic striated pattern was somewhat blunted, consistent with the major effects that hypothyroidism has on cardiomyocyte morphology. In contrast with the PTU-treated mice, striated morphology was well conserved in the औ-MHC TG cardiomyocytes, with the pattern of staining confirming the correct incorporation of TG protein into the sarcomere (Fig. 2C). Cardiac histology was examined using young adult animals (8–12 weeks) (Fig. 2, D and E) and aged animals (1 and 2 years). 2J. Robbins and M. Krenz, unpublished observations. No significant differences in the gross morphology of either heterozygous or homozygous TG hearts were observed, and no differences in heart rate or chamber weight could be detected (TableI). Quantitation of the molecular markers of hypertrophy, which we have found to be a very sensitive marker of any response at the cellular level, was carried out at the transcript level as described previously (34Jones W.K. Grupp I.L. Doetschman T. Grupp G. Osinska H. Hewett T.E. Boivin G. Gulick J. Ng W.A. Robbins J. J. Clin.

No early deaths or overt ill health was noted in any of the TG animals during the first year and a half of life as compared with the NTG experimental cohorts. We conclude that the α → औ transition is benign in terms of the animals overall cardiac morphology of the animals and that no early mortality or morbidity presents under normal animal husbandry conditions.Table IHeart:body and chamber:body weightsNTGTG (heterozygous)TG (homozygous)Body weight (g)25.2 ± 0.623.7 ± 0.823.8 ± 0.6Left ventricle (mg)77.6 ± 2.870.8 ± 5.071.3 ± 2.4Right ventricle (mg)22.0 ± 0.821.2 ± 1.423.4 ± 0.9Atria (mg)8.7 ± 0.610.0 ± 0.210.5 ± 0.5Heart weight (mg)108.0 ± 2.3102.0 ± 4.5105.2 ± 2.6LV/BW ratio3.1 ± 0.13.0 ± 0.13.0 ± 0.1RV/BW ratio0.9 ± 0.10.9 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.1Atria/BW ratio0.11 ± 0.020.14 ± 0.010.15 ± 0.01(LV + RV)/BW ratio4.0 ± 0.13.9 ± 0.14.0 ± 0.1HW/BW ratio4.3 ± 0.14.3 ± 0.14.4 ± 0.2Results were obtained from line 102 TG mice and age-matched NTG controls at 2 months of age, n = 3 in all groups.

In light of the unremarkable phenotype at the whole animal level, we wished to confirm that changes in isoform content had affected the mechanical and kinetic properties of the skinned myofibers. Ventricular papillary muscles were isolated from line 102, PTU-treated and NTG mice. Line 102 heterozygotes have ∼407 औ-MHC while the homozygotes show ∼737 replacement. The skinned fiber is a complex system in which the contractile machinery operates against the internal cytoskeletal structures in both the cardiomyocytes and connective tissue. Therefore,Vmax in a fiber is never truly unloaded, as is assumed to be the case in the in vitro actin motility assay (see below). We first wished to compare the effects of ∼407 replacementversus the fibers derived from PTU-treated animals, in which ∼957 of the cardiac myosin consisted of औ-MHC. Fibers were isolated from 9-week-old animals in order to minimize the effects of any secondary pathology that might develop later in life, and the unloaded shortening and maximum shortening velocities, as well as the relative power that the fibers developed, were measured (Fig.3). As expected on the basis of the degree of α-MHC replaced by औ-MHC, the values derived from line 102 heterozygotes were intermediate between the NTG (1007 α-MHC) and PTU (907 औ-MHC) data. Significant, graded decreases in the unloaded shortening velocity were noted (Fig. 3A) from NTG (3.80 ± 0.14 m. l./s, n = 7) to line 102 (2.72 ± 0.26 m. l./s, n = 4) to the PTU-derived fibers (1.51 ± 0.24 m. l./s, n = 3). The same gradual decreases were also observed in the force-velocity data used to derive the maximum shortening velocities (Fig. 3B). The power-force relationships, and maximum power produced followed the same trend (Fig. 3C), and the data show that the shift in MHC isoform content leads directly to changes in cross-bridge cycling rates. We confirmed both the trend and stability of these changes by developing a cohort of heterozygotes and homozygotes over the course of a year and subsequently carrying out fiber measurements comparing these two populations to NTG fibers (Fig. 4). Similar graded decreases in the unloaded shortening velocity (Fig.4A), maximum shortening velocity (Fig. 4B), and maximum power produced (Fig. 4C) were noted when the NTG, heterozygotes, and homozygotes were compared. No changes in the calcium-force relationship could be observed in any of the TG fibers.2 The above data clearly showed that the cardiomyocyte is tolerant of significant MHC isoform shifts that are transgenically imposed. We next explored the structural basis of the different cardiac myosins' unique functionalities by replacing the endogenous MHC with α/औ chimeras, the working hypothesis being that the functional differences between the isoforms presumably are caused by the different loop sequences. The structure of Loop 1 is thought to modulate the rate of Mg2+-ATP binding and Mg2+-ADP release while the structure of Loop 2 affects the rate of myosin attachment to actin (9Spudich J.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 515-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 10Murphy C.T. Spudich J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6738-6744Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Uyeda T.Q. Ruppel K.M.

Two constructs, in which the sequences of either Loop 1 and Loop 2 (L1+L2) or only Loop 2 (L2) of mouse α-MHC were substituted by the corresponding औ-MHC sequences were made and used to generate TG mice (Fig.5A). In order to detect the TG protein, an antibody to the औ-MHC Loop 2 sequence was generated (Fig.5B). Quantification of protein replacement in hearts from L1+L2- and L2-TG mice by Western blotting (Fig. 5C) showed nearly complete replacement (L1+L2, 1007; L2, 847). This was confirmed by mass spectroscopy, in which the tryptic peptide of the endogenous protein (LMATLFSTYASADTGDSGK, mono-isotopic mass 1935.90) was replaced by the respective fragment containing औ-MHC-sequence (LLSNLFANYAGADAPADK, mono-isotopic mass 1850.93). To determine the effects on motor function, in vitro actin motility assays were performed using MHC that had been isolated from heterozygous line 102 औ-TG mice (407 replacement), from high-replacement (1007) L1+L2 TG hearts, and from NTG as well as from PTU-treated hearts (Fig. 6). V1 → V3 replacement had a clear effect on molecular motor velocity, with the isoform switches in the PTU and औ-MHC TG preparations significantly decreasing the sliding velocity of myosin. For the 407 replacement of V1 with V3 in line 102 heterozygotes, the observed values were intermediate between the NTG and PTU-derived samples, as expected considering the results of our previous studies in which we compared filament sliding velocities of mouse V1/V3mixtures in varying proportions, and observed a linear relationship between relative isoform content and filament sliding velocit"

Here, we conjugated several biologically active laminin peptides onto chitosan membranes and measured the cell attachment activity of peptide-conjugated chitosan membranes with various cell types. The active laminin peptide-conjugated chitosan membranes promoted cell attachment with cell type specificity. A99 (AGTFALRGDNPQG)-chitosan membrane promoted cell attachment with well-organized actin stress fibers. This adhesion was inhibited by EDTA but not by heparin. AG73 (RKRLQVQLSIRT)-chitosan membrane promoted cell attachment with filopodia formation, and this adhesion was inhibited by heparin but not by EDTA. These data suggest that the A99-chitosan membrane interacted with an integrin cellular receptor and that the AG73-chitosan membrane promoted proteoglycan-mediated cell attachment, as previously reported. Furthermore, both AG73-chitosan and A99-chitosan membranes effectively promoted neurite outgrowth with PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. We conclude that conjugation on a chitosan membrane is applicable for testing quantitatively the biological activity of synthetic peptides and that these constructs have a potential ability to serve as bioadhesive materials for tissue regeneration and engineering."
https://openalex.org/W2053853320,"We recently described the cikA (circadian input kinase A) gene, whose product supplies environmental information to the circadian oscillator in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942. CikA possesses three distinct domains: a GAF, a histidine protein kinase (HPK), and a receiver domain similar to those of the response regulator family. To determine how CikA functions in providing circadian input, we constructed modified alleles to tag and truncate the protein, allowing analysis of each domain individually. CikA co-valently bound bilin chromophores in vitro, even though it lacks the expected ligand residues, and the GAF domain influenced but did not entirely account for this function. Full-length CikA and truncated variants that carry the HPK domain showed autophosphorylation activity. Deletion of the GAF domain or the N-terminal region adjacent to GAF dramatically reduced autophosphorylation, whereas elimination of the receiver domain increased activity 10-fold. Assays to test phosphorelay from the HPK to the cryptic receiver domain, which lacks the conserved aspartyl residue that serves as a phosphoryl acceptor in response regulators, were negative. We propose that the cryptic receiver is a regulatory domain that interacts with an unknown protein partner to modulate the autokinase activity of CikA but does not work as bona fide receiver domain in a phosphorelay.

The wide variety of organisms in which biological clocks have been described share the important feature that their endogenous clocks can be set to “local time” by external environmental signals such as light and temperature (1Dunlap J.C.

Devlin P.F. Kay S.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1488-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Cryptochromes are blue light photoreceptors that most likely evolved from DNA photolyases. They bind two chromophores, flavin-adenine dinucleotide, and a pterin (methenyltetrahydrofolate) or a deazaflavin (7,8-didemethyl-8-hydroxy-5-deazariboflavine). The latter functions in light perception by transducing excitation energy to flavinadenine dinucleotide, which then catalyzes an electron transfer reaction in the DNA photolyase (5Cashmore A.R.

Science. 1999; 286: 2517-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Many of these proteins exhibit a similar domain structure to plant phytochromes with an N-terminal bilin-binding domain that is associated with an HPK module (23Montgomery B.L. Lagarias J.C. Trends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 357-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The HPK domain of cyanobacterial Cph1 has been shown to have authentic HPK activity (19Yeh K.C. Wu S.H. Murphy J.T. Lagarias J.C. Science. 1997; 277: 1505-1508Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). We recently described the cikA gene of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, which encodes a phytochrome-related protein with similarity to HPKs of bacterial two component signal transduction systems (24Chang C. Stewart R.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 25Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev.

Sci. 2001; 26: 369-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and is involved in signal perception for resetting the circadian clock in response to environmental cues (27Schmitz O. Katayama M. Williams S.B. Kondo T. Golden S.S. Science. 2000; 289: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CikA was first identified from a Tn5 mutant that has subtle alterations in light-responsive regulation of the photosystem II gene psbAII (28Golden S.S. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 693-714Google Scholar). The mutant has an expression level of a psbAII::luxAB reporter fusion strain that is 50–80% of that in wild type (WT) under low light conditions and exhibits an exaggerated increase in expression upon exposure to higher light intensities. However, a more striking circadian phenotype was observed, because both the period length and amplitude of circadian rhythms of different luxAB reporter strains (kaiB::luxAB, purF::luxAB, and kaiA::luxAB) were reduced (27Schmitz O. Katayama M. Williams S.B. Kondo T. Golden S.S. Science. 2000; 289: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 29Andersson C.R. Tsinoremas N.F. Shelton J. Lebedeva N.V. Yarrow J. Min H.

Hall J.C. Kay S.A. J. Biol. Rhythms. 1997; 12: 204-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, the relative phasing of expression (timing of circadian peaks) was altered for some genes. The additive effect on period length reduction of cikA inactivation in both short and long period kai mutants of S. elongatus suggested that CikA and the Kai proteins have independent, nonoverlapping functions. A lack of phase resetting in the CikA-free mutant in response to a 5-h dark pulse that resets WT revealed that CikA functions as a sensor component on the input pathway of the circadian clock. The deduced amino acid sequence of cikA reveals it to be a member of the extended phytochrome family (27Schmitz O. Katayama M. Williams S.B. Kondo T. Golden S.S. Science. 2000; 289: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). CikA exhibits a typical bacteriophytochrome domain structure with an N-terminal GAF domain (13Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and a C-terminal histidine kinase motif possessing H-, N-, D/F-, and G-boxes, as defined previously by Stock et al. (31Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-Component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington D.C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar). By contrast, CikA lacks the PAS domains present in plant phytochromes (27Schmitz O. Katayama M. Williams S.B. Kondo T. Golden S.S. Science. 2000; 289: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 32Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relative to the plant phytochromes PhyA–E and the cyanobacterial bacteriophytochromes Cph1 of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (18Hughes J. Lamparter T. Mittmann F. Hartmann E. Gartner W. Wilde A. Borner T. Nature. 1997; 386: 663Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 33Zhulin I.B. Taylor B.L. Dixon R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 331-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) and RcaE of Fremyella diplosiphon (17Kehoe D.M. Grossman A.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1409-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), the GAF domain of CikA has a deletion near the usually conserved cysteine ligand for bilin binding; this makes it difficult to evaluate which residues, if any, play a role in bilin association with the CikA apoprotein. Indeed, CikA appears to lack both the conserved Cys residue that serves as the site for bilin attachment in plant phytochrome photoreceptors and the adjacent His residue to which phycocyanobilin (PCB) or biliverdin (BV) binds for some BphPs from nonphotosynthetic bacteria (22Davis S.J. Vener A.V. Vierstra R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2517-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 34Bhoo S.H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Vierstra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region of CikA has similarities to receiver domains of two component response regulators (RR) such as PhoB. However, the mode of action of this RR domain may be different, because the conserved Asp residue necessary for phosphoryl transfer is missing (24Chang C. Stewart R.C. Plant Physiol. 1998; 117: 723-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 25Stock A.M. Robinson V.L. Goudreau P.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 183-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar, 26West A.H. Stock A.M. Trends Biochem.

Science. 2000; 289: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). In this regard, the CikA structure is similar to the family of so-called pseudo-response regulators (APRR) that has been identified in A. thaliana (35Makino S. Kiba T. Imamura A. Hanaki N. Nakamura A. Suzuki T. Taniguchi M. Ueguchi C. Sugiyama T. Mizuno T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 36Makino S. Matsushika A. Kojima M. Oda Y.

Science. 2000; 289: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). APRRs also possess N-terminal CONSTANS “Myb-related” motifs, which regulate transcriptional activity in eukaryotes, in addition to their pseudo-receiver domains. In contrast to the authentic response regulator proteins of A. thaliana, APRRs lack two of three invariant residues of receiver domains, which apparently prevents them from accepting phosphoryl groups from A. thaliana histidine kinases in vitro (35Makino S. Kiba T. Imamura A. Hanaki N. Nakamura A. Suzuki T. Taniguchi M. Ueguchi C. Sugiyama T. Mizuno T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 791-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). APRR mutants also exhibit significant circadian phenotypes, such as delayed flowering and shortened periods of several rhythmic markers, including expression of the CAB (chlorophyll a/b-binding protein) gene (37Matsushika A. Makino S. Kojima M. Mizuno T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2000; 41: 1002-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 38Strayer C. Oyama T. Schultz T.F. Raman R. Somers D.E. Mas P. Panda S. Kreps J.A. Kay S.A. Science. 2000; 289: 768-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). To determine whether CikA is an input photoreceptor to the cyanobacterial circadian clock and to clarify its mode of action, we made a variety of plasmid constructs for expression of tagged full-length and truncated CikA variants in Escherichia coli and in S. elongatus. After showing functionality of the His-tagged CikA variant in complementation experiments, we investigated the ability of affinity-purified CikA to covalently attach a bilin chromophore in vitro. We also tested the influence of other predicted domains on the autophosphorylation activity of the HPK. The results suggest regulatory roles for the N-terminal, GAF, and pseudo-receiver domains.

Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of His6- and Trx-tagged CikA and Truncated Versions of CikA in E. coli—Expression of recombinant CikA6HIS was achieved using the Qiaexpress overexpression system (Qiagen) for synthesis of N-terminal His6-tagged proteins. A PCR-derived fragment using primers AMO558 and F0748, encoding the entire cikA gene except the first methionine, was cloned into SacI/SalI-digested pQE30/80L expression vector and used to transform E. coli SG13009. The cells were grown to OD600 nm = 0.5, induced with 0.9 mm IPTG, and grown for an additional 3–5 h at 25 °C to minimize the formation of insoluble protein. The cells were harvested and passed twice through a prechilled French press at 137.9 MPa. This extract was clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 12,000 × g to prepare a lysate for affinity purification on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) matrix (Qiagen). For expression of truncated versions of CikA, we used the pET overexpression system (Novagen), generating fusion proteins that carry an N-terminal thioredoxin domain (Trx) for enhanced solubility as well as N- and/or C-terminal His6 tags for purification by a Ni-NTA matrix (Table II).Table IICharacteristics of variant CikA proteinsDomains in native CikA were defined as follows: (i) GAF domain: aa 184-338; (ii) HPK domain; H-box aa 393, N-box aa 498-518, D/F-box aa 536-562; and (iii) RR domain: aa 630-689.NameStrainEncoded amino acids of native CikALocation of His tagCikAHIS6AM24782-754N terminusTrx-CikAAM29322-754N terminusΔRRAM27602-621Twin tagΔATPAM27982-419N terminusΔHPKAM28032-390N terminusN + GAFAM28042-350Twin tagΔNAM2933184-754N terminusΔGAFAM29342-183, 399-754N terminusTrx-RRAM2761606-754N terminusTrx-GAFAM2935184-350Twin tagTrx-H393AAM29372-754N terminus Open table in a new tab Expression and Purification of Cik6HISin S. elongatus—5 ml of stationary phase AMC1006 was added to 500 ml of fresh BG-11M medium, incubated in an aquarium at 30 °C and a light intensity of ∼200 microeinsteins m–2 s–1, and bubbled with 1% CO2 in air. When the cells were grown to an OD750 nm of 1.5, production of CikA6HIS was induced with 2 mm IPTG. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in 20 ml of Buffer 1 (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl). After passage through a prechilled French press at 137.9 MPa, a cleared lysate was prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. CikA6HIS in the soluble protein fraction was diluted to 200 ml in Buffer 1. Protein was bound to Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), washed, and eluted with Buffer 1 that contained 50 and 250 mm imidazole, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1975846783,"Sonic hedgehog (Shh), a vertebrate homologue of the Drosophila segment-polarity gene hedgehog, has been reported to play an important role during normal development of various tissues. Abnormal activities of Shh signaling pathway have been implicated in tumorigenesis such as basal cell carcinomas and medulloblastomas. Here we show that Shh signaling negatively regulates prostatic epithelial ductal morphogenesis. In organotypic cultures of developing rat prostates, Shh inhibited cell proliferation and promoted differentiation of luminal epithelial cells. The expression pattern of Shh and its receptors suggests a paracrine mechanism of action. The Shh receptors Ptc1 (Patched1) and Ptc2 were found to be expressed in prostatic stromal cells adjacent to the epithelium, where Shh itself was produced. This paracrine model was confirmed by co-culturing the developing prostate in the presence of stromal cells transfected with a vector expressing a constitutively active form of Smoothened, the real effector of the Shh signaling pathway. Furthermore, expression of activin A and TGF-β1 that were shown previously to inhibit prostatic epithelial branching was up-regulated following Shh treatment in the organotypic cultures. Taken together, these results suggest that Shh negatively regulates prostatic ductal branching indirectly by acting on the surrounding stromal cells, at least partly via up-regulating expression of activin A and TGF-β1.

The prostatic epithelial buds continue to undergo extensive ductal outgrowth and branching into the surrounding mesenchyme during the first 3 weeks after birth (3Sugimura Y. Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A.

In the mature prostate, there are essentially two major types of epithelial cells within the prostatic epithelium: the luminal and basal cells. They can be distinguished based on their location, morphology, function, and expression profile of specific cytokeratins (5Hayward S.W. Baskin L.S. Haughney P.C. Cunha A.R. Foster B.A. Dahiya R. Prins G.S. Cunha G.R. Acta Anatomica. 1996; 155: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The luminal cells located in the apical region of the epithelium are generally believed to be terminally differentiated cells that are androgen-dependent and produce secretory proteins (5Hayward S.W.

The basal cells residing between the luminal cells and the underlying basement membrane express cytokeratin 14 or p63 (6Signoretti S. Waltregny D. Dilks J. Isaac B. Lin D. Garraway L. Yang A.

Currently, the molecular mechanisms that control prostatic ductal morphogenesis and luminal epithelial cell differentiation are still poorly understood. Among several molecules that might be involved in regulation of prostatic ductal branching (reviewed in Ref. 8Abate-Shen C. Shen M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2410-2443Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), sonic hedgehog (Shh)1 is a good candidate. Originally identified as a homologue of the segment-polarity gene hedgehog of the Drosophila (9Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2504) Google Scholar), Shh has been reported to be expressed at numerous sites of epithelial and mesenchymal cell lineages during development (10Marti E.

Both Drosophila and mouse genetics show that the seven transmembrane protein, Smo (Smoothened) is required for Shh signaling (15Alcedo J. Ayzenzon M. Von Ohlen T. Noll M. Hooper J.E.

Ptc (Patched) appears to negatively regulate Smo in the absence of Shh (18Goodrich L. Milenkovic K. Higgins L. Scoot M.

Development. 1998; 125: 4943-4948Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even though it is widely accepted that Shh binds to Ptc (21Marigo V. Davey R.A. Zuo Y. Cunningham J.M. Tabin C.J.

Nature. 1996; 384: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (971) Google Scholar) with high affinity, it is unclear how Shh binding results in the activation of its downstream target Smo, as well as the subsequent signaling pathway. The original model suggested that Ptc binds directly to Smo and represses its activity in the absence of Shh. Upon Shh binding the normal inhibition by Ptc is released, and Smo initiates signaling. However, recent studies in Drosophila have suggested that Ptc may not repress Smo activity through a direct interaction but rather that Ptc inhibits Smo activity from a distance (23Chen Y. Struhl G.

Although a recent study suggested that Shh signaling might be involved in the initial morphogenesis of the prostate during embryogenesis (37Podlasek C. Barnett D. Clemens J. Bak P. Bushman W. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 28-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), prostatic development and maturation mainly occurs during the postnatal period (3Sugimura Y. Cunha G.R. Donjacour A.A. Biol. Reprod. 1986; 34: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 4Timms B. Mohs T. Didio L. J. Urol. 1994; 151: 1427-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 5Hayward S.W. Baskin L.S.

Regulation of epithelial ductal branching and differentiation of luminal epithelial cells by Shh after the prostatic primodium is formed around birth is not clearly addressed. In the present experiments, we focused on a possible role of Shh during postnatal prostatic ductal morphogenesis and luminal epithelial cell differentiation. We determined the cellular expression pattern of Shh and its receptors, Ptc1 and Ptc2, and studied functions of Shh during postnatal prostatic development by comparing Shh with testosterone and cyclopamine in postnatal prostate organ cultures. We found that Shh inhibited epithelial ductal branching of the prostate. Shh appeared to act indirectly through stromal cells, because Ptc1 and Ptc2 were selectively expressed in the stromal cells. More importantly, co-culturing developing prostate with stromal cells overexpressing a constitutively active form of Smo (SmoM2) (33Xie J. Murone M. Luoh S.M. Ryan A. Gu Q. Zhang C. Bonifas J.M. Lam C.W. Hynes M. Goddard A. Rosenthal A. Epstein Jr., E.H. de Sauvage F.J. Nature. 1998; 391: 90-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar) mimicked the effects of Shh on prostatic branching morphogenesis. This effect led to an up-regulation of activin A and TGF-β1, which are shown previously (38Cancilla B. Jarred R.A. Wang H. Mellor S.L. Cunha G.R. Risbridger G.P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 237: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 39Ball E.M. Risbridger G.P. Dev. Biol. 2001; 238: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 40Zhao H. Patra A. Tanaka Y.

Therefore, we propose that Shh regulates prostatic branching morphogenesis indirectly via the stroma by at least in part up-regulating expression of activin A and TGF-β1. The ventral prostate whole mounts were dissected from postnatal day 2 (P2) rats and plated on cell culture inserts (8-μm pore size; BD Biosciences) individually in serum-free medium. Serum-free medium was made of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 plus serum-free supplement (I-1884; Sigma), 1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm glutamine, 5 mg/ml glucose, 25 ng/ml fungizone, and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 mg/ml streptomycin, modified as described previously (41Zheng J. Gao W.-Q. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Shh (400 nm; Genentech), cyclopamine (5 μm; kind gift of Dr. W. Gaffield at Western Regional Research Center, United States Department of Agriculture, Albany, CA), and testosterone (10–8 m; Sigma) was added to the medium at the beginning of the cultures. The medium was changed every other day. For some cultures, BrdUrd was introduced into the medium for 17 h before the cultures were fixed on the fourth day. In some experiments, individual P2 rat prostate was cut into 16 pieces, mixed with stromal cells transfected either with a control vector or a vector expressing a constitutively active form of Smo (SmoM2) or Gli1 when they were plated together in the cell culture inserts. Stromal cells were isolated from E17 rat urogenital sinus by tearing away urogenital epithelium following incubation in 0.2 m EDTA in Hanks'-buffered saline as described previously (42Chung L.W.

The cultures were fixed at various time points in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (0.1 m, pH 7.4) for 30 min at room temperature before they were processed for immunocytochemistry (43Zheng J. Shou J. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Gao W.-Q. Development. 2000; 127: 4551-4560PubMed Google Scholar). Cell transfection was performed using GenePorter, essentially in a similar manner as described previously (44Shou J. Ross S. Koeppen H. de Sauvage F.J. Gao W.-Q. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7291-7297PubMed Google Scholar, 45Shou J. Soriano R. Hayward S. Cunha G. Williams P. Gao W.-Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. (U. S. A.). 2002; 99: 2830-2835Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from four cultures of each of the experimental groups 2 days after treatment with Shh using RNeasy columns (Qiagen), treated with DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 15 min at room temperature, and cleaned using RNeasy columns as described (44Shou J. Ross S. Koeppen H. de Sauvage F.J. Gao W.-Q. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7291-7297PubMed Google Scholar). For BrdUrd and cytokeratin 14 double immunocytochemistry, fixed cultures were treated with 2 nHCl for 30 min at room temperature. After washes, the preparations were then incubated with a mixture of anti-BrdUrd antibody (1:40; BD Biosciences) and anti-cytokeratin 14 (1:10,000; Berkeley Antibody Company) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% normal donkey serum and 0.2% Triton overnight at 4 °C. Positive staining was visualized by incubation with FITC-conjugated donkey anti-mouse and Texas red-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies as described previously (44Shou J. Ross S. Koeppen H. de Sauvage F.J. Gao W.-Q. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7291-7297PubMed Google Scholar). Some of the cultures were labeled with anti-Shh monoclonal antibody (5E1, 1:1000; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) or double stained with anti-p63 antibody (1:200 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) mediated via FITC-conjugated secondary antibody and 7AAD (Molecular Probes). Cultures were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology) containing counter staining dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) and viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot epifluorescent microscope. Images were captured with Compix imaging systems using a cooled RGB CCD camera and analyzed using Adobe PhotoShop 4.0. Sections labeled with anti-p63 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and 7AAD (Molecular Probes) were viewed using a Bio-Rad MRC-600 confocal microscope. Cell counts were performed on the digital images captured from the sections of the cultures. For BrdUrd labeling index, BrdUrd-labeled cells versus the total number of epithelial cells in given epithelial ducts (cytokeratin 14 highlighted region) or a given area of stromal area were counted against DAPI counter-stained nuclei. Approximately 1,500 cells were counted from randomly selected 15–20 sections from each of the experimental groups. Data were then normalized to the control cultures and are expressed as mean ± S.D. For luminal cell differentiation analysis, p63 negative cells and total epithelial cells (7AAD-positive) in randomly selected epithelial ducts were counted from five to six sections from each of the experimental groups, normalized to the control group, and expressed as mean ± S.D. Two-way, unpaired t test was used for statistical analysis. [33P]UTP-labeled sense and antisense riboprobes were generated from PCR products cloned into transcription vectors (46Lu L.H. Gillett N.A. Cell Vision. 1994; 1: 169-176Google Scholar). The murine Ptc1 and Ptc2 cDNA, cloned in pBluescript, (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) spanned from nucleotides 3518 to 4289 of MMU46155 (for Ptc1) and from nucleotides 883 to 1309 of AJ133485 (for Ptc2), respectively. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, dissected mouse prostatic tissue (postnatal days 7 and 16 and adult) was sectioned and deparaffinized. The in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (44Shou J. Ross S. Koeppen H. de Sauvage F.J. Gao W.-Q. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7291-7297PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue pre-treatments consisted of a proteinase K digestion (4 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C, a 0.5× SSC wash for 10 min at room temperature, and dehydration prior to application of the pre-hybridization solution. Slides were processed for autoradiography and exposed for 4 weeks before developing. Sense control probes revealed no hybridization above background (not shown). TaqMan real-time quantitative PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was performed as described (43Zheng J. Shou J. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Gao W.-Q. Development. 2000; 127: 4551-4560PubMed Google Scholar, 44Shou J. Ross S. Koeppen H. de Sauvage F.J. Gao W.-Q. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7291-7297PubMed Google Scholar). The following specific probes and primers were used for Ptc1 (probe, TGCCTCCTGGTCACACGAACAATGG; forward primer, CTCCAAGTGTCGTCCGGTTT; reverse primer, TGTACTCCGAGTCGGAATC), Ptc2 (probe, CCCAACGCGCCCTCTTTGATCTG; forward primer, TGGCTTTGACTACGCCCAC; reverse primer, GGGAGCTGAAGCGCTGG), activin A (probe TGTGAACAGTGCCAGGAGAGCGGT; forward primer, CCTGGATGTGCGGATTGC; reverse primer, TGCCCAGGAGCACTAGGC), TGF-β1 (probe, CATCTCGATTTTTATCCCGGTGGCATACTG; forward primer, TGGGTCCCAGAGAGCGC; reverse primer, GGAGTCGCGGTGACGC), BMP4 (probe, AGAGCGCCGTCATCCCGGATTACAT; forward primer, CGTCCGCAGCCGAGC; reverse primer, TGGAGCCGGTAAAGATCCC), and BMP7 (probe, TGAGGATGGCCAGTGTGGCAGAAAA; forward primer, GCCAAAGAACCAAGAGGCC; reverse primer, TGCCTCTGGTCACTGCTGC). Probes and primers for the control housekeeping gene Gapdh were the same as reported (44Shou J. Ross S. Koeppen H. de Sauvage F.J. Gao W.-Q. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7291-7297PubMed Google Scholar). Expression levels of genes of interest were normalized to gapdh (43Zheng J. Shou J. Guillemot F. Kageyama R. Gao W.-Q. Development. 2000; 127: 4551-4560PubMed Google Scholar). Initial RT-PCR amplifications were also examined by agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure that bands were only visible at the expected molecular weights. Data were collected from four cultures from each of experimental groups and are expressed as mean ± S.D. When whole mount ventral prostate organs were isolated from postnatal day 2 rats and maintained in serum-free medium (see “Materials and Methods”), epithelial ductal branching and expansion continued (Fig. 1A), although at a slower pace than in the cultures where testosterone was included (Fig. 1D). These observations are in agreement with previous work by Cunha and co-workers (47Lipschutz J.H. Foster B.A. Cunha G.R. Prostate. 1997; 32: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, a significant inhibition of branching morphogenesis was observed in cultures treated with 400 nm Shh (Fig. 1B). Lower concentrations of Shh (200 nm) also led to clear, though less profound, growth inhibition (data not shown). In contrast, cultures grown in the presence of an Shh pathway antagonist, cyclopamine at 2.5 or 5 μm, showed enhanced epithelial growth (Fig.1C). This inhibition was further confirmed by immunocytochemistry of cultures with an anti-cytokeratin 14 antibody that highlights the epithelial area in the ductal units (5Hayward S.W. Baskin L.S. Haughney P.C. Cunha A.R. Foster B.A. Dahiya R. Prins G.S. Cunha G.R. Acta Anatomica. 1996; 155: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1F, the number of epithelial ductal tips was much lower in cultures where Shh was present than in control cultures (Fig.1E). On the other hand, the tips of the epithelial ducts in the cultures containing cyclopamine were enlarged (Fig. 1G). Similar growth-inhibiting effects were also observed when the tissues were cultured in the presence of both testosterone and Shh (data not shown), suggesting that Shh can override the stimulating effects of testosterone on epithelial cell growth. In addition, when both Shh and cyclopamine were added together to the culture, the growth pattern was the same as in cultures treated with cyclopamine alone (not shown), indicating that the concentration of cyclopamine used (5 μm) is sufficient to block both exogenous and endogenous Shh activity. The concentrations of Shh used in the present experiments (200 and 400 nm) are similar to previous studies on induction of midbrain dopaminergic neurons (48Hynes M. Porter J. Chiang C. Chang D. Tessier-Lavigne M. Beachy P. Rosenthal A. Neuron. 1995; 15: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). To further rule out the possibility that the growth-inhibiting effects of Shh we observed might be because of any potential general toxicity of Shh, we did cell death analysis by performing TUNEL staining on the sections of the cultures from all four experimental groups. Only negligible number of TUNEL-positive cells were observed in any of the cultures grown in the presence or absence of Shh at 400 nm, cyclopamine at 5 μm, or testosterone at 10–8 m. However, a dramatic elevation in the number of TUNEL-positive cells was seen (92.0 ± 60.9, n = 4) in sections of the cultures grown in the presence of 10 μm cyclopamine, suggesting that at higher concentrations, cyclopamine might be toxic. To examine whether Shh influences prostatic morphogenesis by affecting cell proliferation, we performed BrdUrd immunocytochemistry with all four groups of cultures. We found that BrdUrd labeling index was greatly reduced in both epithelial and stromal areas of the Shh-treated cultures (Fig. 2, C andD versus A and B). In contrast, BrdUrd labeling index was elevated in the cultures treated with cyclopamine (Fig. 2, E and F). Testosterone, a potent mitogen used as a positive control, showed the highest BrdUrd labeling index (Fig. 2, G and H). Cell counts of the number of BrdUrd-labeled cells versus total number of epithelial cells in a given ductal unit or total stromal cells in a given stromal area provided quantitative support to our observations. The BrdUrd labeling index in the epithelium is as follows: control, 80.3 ± 21.4; Shh-treated, 48.6 ± 18.6; cyclopamine-treated, 93.1 ± 11.8; testosterone-treated, 111.44 ± 16.8 (p < 0.01, between Shh-treated and control or between testosterone-treated and control; p< 0.05 between cyclopamime-treated and control). Data were normalized to the control group and are plotted in Fig.3.Figure 3Quantitation of BrdUrd labeling index in the cultured developing prostates. Data were normalized to the control group before being plotted. Note that the number of BrdUrd-positive cells are reduced in Shh-treated cultures but increased in cyclopamine-treated cultures in both the epithelium (A) and the stroma (B). Testosterone showed an increased number of BrdUrd-positive cells in both the epithelium (A) and the stroma (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) By postnatal day 5 of normal development, some of the basal cells that are normally cytokeratin 14/p63-positive start to become postmitotic and differentiate into cytokeratin 14/p63-negative luminal cells (5Hayward S.W. Baskin L.S. Haughney P.C. Cunha A.R. Foster B.A. Dahiya R. Prins G.S. Cunha G.R. Acta Anatomica. 1996; 155: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To determine whether luminal cell differentiation is also affected by Shh, cultures were maintained for 7 days in serum-free medium and were double-labeled with anti-p63 antibody that highlights basal epithelial cells and 7AAD that stains nuclei of all cells. We found that the proportion of luminal cells among the total epithelial cell population within an individual ductal unit was significantly higher in the Shh-treated cultures (Fig.4B) as compared with control cultures (Fig. 4A). Consistent with this observation, the proportion of luminal cells in ductal units was significantly lower in the cultures treated with cyclopamine (Fig. 4C). Testosterone showed the highest percentage as it is expected to promote luminal cell differentiation in addition to cell proliferation (47Lipschutz J.H. Foster B.A. Cunha G.R. Prostate. 1997; 32: 35-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ratio of luminal to total epithelial cells from all four types of cultures are shown in Fig. 4E (p < 0.05, between Shh-treated and control; p < 0.01 between control and cyclopamine or testosterone-treated). These observations suggest that Shh appears to regulate prostatic morphogenesis not only by inhibiting proliferation of progenitor cells but also by promoting terminal differentiation of luminal cells. Cell counts of luminal cells per ductal unit revealed an absolute increase in luminal cells (control, 9.2 ± 1.1; Shh-treated, 15.2 ± 1.9; mean ± S.E., n = 35, p < 0.01) and provided further support for this model. Therefore, Shh pushes the progenitor cells out of cell cycle earlier than scheduled and induces a precocious differentiation into luminal epithelial cells. Previous studies (22Stone D.M. Hynes M. Armanini M. Swanson T.A. Gu Q.M. Johnson R.L. Scott M.P. Pennica D. Goddard A. Phillips H. Noll M. Hooper J.E. De Sauvage F. Rosenthal A.

Ptc genes also constitute good reporters for Shh pathway activation as they are both up-regulated upon Shh signaling. Therefore, determination of the expression patterns of Ptc1 and Ptc2 in the prostatic tissue would help us to understand the mechanism of action by Shh and in particular the cell type targeted by Shh activity.

The biliverdin is subsequently reduced to bilirubin by biliverdin reductase. Earlier kinetic studies suggested that biliverdin reductase facilitates the release of biliverdin from hHO-1 (Liu, Y., and Ortiz de Montellano, P. R. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 5297–5307). We have investigated the binding of P450 reductase and biliverdin reductase to truncated, soluble hHO-1 by fluorescence resonance energy transfer and site-specific mutagenesis. P450 reductase and biliverdin reductase bind to truncated hHO-1 with Kd = 0.4 ± 0.1 and 0.2 ± 0.1 μm, respectively. FRET experiments indicate that biliverdin reductase and P450 reductase compete for binding to truncated hHO-1. Mutation of surface ionic residues shows that hHO-1 residues Lys18, Lys22, Lys179, Arg183, Arg198, Glu19, Glu127, and Glu190 contribute to the binding of cytochrome P450 reductase. The mutagenesis results and a computational analysis of the protein surfaces partially define the binding site for P450 reductase. An overlapping binding site including Lys18, Lys22, Lys179, Arg183, and Arg185 is similarly defined for biliverdin reductase. These results confirm the binding of biliverdin reductase to hHO-1 and define binding sites of the two reductases."

TLCA impairs hepatobiliary exocytosis, a key step for the insertion of apical carrier proteins into their target membrane, and lowers the density of the apical conjugate export pump, Mrp2, in canalicular membranes of liver cells in association with reduced canalicular excretion of organic anions (6Beuers U.

In parallel, TLCA modulates a number of signaling events in liver cells that may contribute to membrane vesicle fusion and membrane protein insertion; TLCA may (i) impair Ca2+ influx across hepatocellular membranes (8Combettes L.

The role of PKCε as a mediator of TLCA-induced cholestasis, however, remains elusive because specific PKCε inhibitors for in vivo use are not available. Products of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3Ks) are mediators of diverse cellular functions and may also modulate secretory activity of epithelial cells (12Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol.

In hepatocytes, PI3K is involved in taurocholic acid (TCA)-induced biliary bile acid secretion (14Misra S. Ujhazy P. Gatmaitan Z. Varticovski L. Arias I.M. J. Biol.

Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that the TLCA cholestatic effects may be mediated by PI3K- and PKCε-dependent mechanisms. PI3K can be selectively blocked by specific PI3K inhibitors, among which wortmannin is the best characterized in vivo and in vitro (20Powis G. Bonjouklian R. Berggren M.M. Gallegos A. Abraham R.

In contrast to TLCA, the hydrophilic bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is a potent anticholestatic agent and is used for the treatment of a number of cholestatic disorders (21Lazaridis K.N.

Recently, PI3K was proposed to contribute to TUDCA-induced stimulation of bile acid secretion in normal rat liver (23Kurz A.K. Block C. Graf D. Dahl S.V. Schliess F. Haussinger D. Biochem.

In the present study we investigated the role of PI3K and PKCε in TLCA-induced impairment of bile secretion in vivo in the model of the isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL) as well as in vitro in isolated rat hepatocyte couplets (IRHC) using the selective PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. We also investigated the role of PI3K in the ability of TUDCA to reverse TLCA-induced impairment of bile flow, organic anion secretion, and hepatobiliary exocytosis.

Aprotinin, taurine-conjugated bile acids, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), horseradish peroxidase (HRP, type II), leupeptin, wortmannin, and albumin (fraction V) were from Sigma. 1-Chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) was from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Aurora, OH). Easytides [γ32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A renaissance Western blot chemiluminescence reagent was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other chemicals were of the highest purity commercially available. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (229 ± 16 g) were obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). They were subjected to a 12-h day-night rhythm with free access to rodent food and water. The technical procedure used has been described previously (6Beuers U. Bilzer M. Chittattu A. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Keppler D. Paumgartner G. Dombrowski F. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneal). After cannulation of the bile duct, the portal vein, and the inferior vena cava, the latter was ligated above the right renal vein. The liver was perfused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (6Beuers U. Bilzer M. Chittattu A. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Keppler D. Paumgartner G. Dombrowski F. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) at 37 °C at a constant flow rate of 4.0–4.5 ml/min/g of liver. Temperature and perfusion pressure were continuously monitored and did not significantly change during any of the experimental conditions chosen in this study. Bile flow was measured gravimetrically in pretared tubes. Hepatovenous efflux of lactate dehydrogenase was measured as an indicator of liver cell damage by use of a standard enzymatic test (24Bergmeyer H.U. Bernt E. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 3. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1983: 574-579Google Scholar). Two perfusion protocols were applied for determination of (i) hepatobiliary exocytosis and (ii) secretion of the model Mrp2 substrate, 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (GS-DNP). Livers were preloaded with 5 mg/dl HRP, 1 g/dl bovine serum albumin for 25 min in a recirculating Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate perfusion solution (40 ml/min). The perfusion was then switched to a non-recirculating HRP- and bovine serum albumin-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate perfusion, residual HRP in the vascular bed was washed out for 5 min, and the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (or the carrier Me2SO only, 0.001%, v/v), was continuously infused to reach a final concentration of 100 nmol/liter in the portal vein. After 5 min, bile acids (or the carrier Me2SO only; 0.1%, v/v) were infused for 50 min at a continuous rate into the perfusion medium to reach a final concentration of 10 or 25 μmol/liter, respectively, in the portal vein. At the end of the experiments, the left anterior liver lobe was clamped and excised. A sample of about 200 mg wet weight was immediately transferred into ice-cold homogenization buffer and was homogenized for determination of PKCε distribution (see below). Livers were perfused in a non-recirculating fashion with HRP- and bovine serum albumin-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate for 95 min. After 15 min, the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, (or the carrier Me2SO only, 0.001%, v/v) was continuously infused for 80 min to reach a final concentration of 100 nmol/liter in the portal vein. After 20 min, the bile acids TLCA and TUDCA (or the carrier Me2SO only; 0.1%, v/v) were infused for 75 min at a continuous rate into the perfusion medium to reach a final concentration of 10 or 25 μmol/liter, respectively, in the portal vein. After 45 min, CDNB, the precursor of GS-DNP, was infused for 10 min to reach a final concentration of 30 μmol/liter in the portal vein, at which saturation of biliary GS-DNP secretion was observed in the perfused rat liver (26Wahllander A. Sies H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 96: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At the end of the experiments, the left anterior liver lobe was clamped and excised. A sample of this lobe was immediately shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C for determination of PI3K activity and PKB (Ser-473) phosphorylation (see below). Biliary HRP activity was determined spectrophotometrically using 4-aminoantipyrine as substrate and recording the linear change in absorption at 510 nm for 3 min at a constant temperature of 25 °C (6Beuers U. Bilzer M. Chittattu A. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Keppler D. Paumgartner G. Dombrowski F. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 25Beuers U. Nathanson M.H. Isales C.M. Boyer J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2984-2993Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). HRP (ng of protein/min/g of liver) was quantitated after establishing HRP standard curves. Biliary HRP secretion was expressed as % of secretion at min 45 (after HRP loading and washout period) to correct for differences in base-line total HRP activity. Biliary secretion of GS-DNP was determined spectrophotometrically (6Beuers U. Bilzer M. Chittattu A. Kullak-Ublick G.A. Keppler D. Paumgartner G. Dombrowski F. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1206-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar,26Wahllander A. Sies H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1979; 96: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 5 μl of bile were added to 1000 μl of H2O in a cuvette. Absorption was measured at 335 nm, and biliary GS-DNP levels (nmol/liter) were calculated using the formula c =E335Vtotal/εdVbile(E335, absorption at 335 nm;Vtotal, 1005 μl; ε, molar absorption coefficient 9.6 liters nmol−1 cm−1;d, 1 cm; Vbile, 5 μl). The low background absorption at 335 nm of the bile sample collected just before infusion of CDNB was set as 0. PI3K activity in hepatic tissue was determined by use of a PI3K assay. In brief, 100 mg of shock-frozen tissue were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (1 ml/50 mg of tissue; HEPES, 50 mmol/liter; NaCl, 137 mmol/liter; CaCl2, 1 mmol/liter; MgCl2, 1 mmol/liter; Na4P2O7, 10 mmol/liter; NaF, 10 mmol/liter; EDTA, 2 mmol/liter; tergitol Nonidet P-40, 1% (v/v); glycerol, 10%, v/v; antipain, 10 mg/liter; aprotinin, 2 mg/liter; benzamidine, 9.6 mmol/liter; leupeptin, 10 μmol/liter; Na3VO4, 2 mmol/liter; pepstatin, 0.73 μmol/liter; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmol/liter, pH 7.5). Samples were kept on ice for 30 min and were then centrifuged for 30 min (3.500 × g, 4 °C). For immunoprecipitation, aliquots from the supernatant containing 500 μg of protein were incubated with 4 μg of anti-PI3K p85, p110α, or p110β antibody at 4 °C overnight and precipitated with 80 μl of A/G-agarose for 2–4 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 1 min, 4 °C), the pellet was washed 3 times with lysis buffer, 3 times with buffer B (Tris, 100 mmol/liter; LiCl, 5 mmol/liter; Na3VO4, 0.1 mmol/liter; pH 7.4, 4 °C) and 2 times with buffer C (NaCl, 150 mmol/liter; Tris, 10 mmol/liter; EDTA, 5 mmol/liter; Na3VO4, 0.1 mmol/liter; pH 7.4, 4 °C). The PI3K assay was then started by adding 50 μl of a reaction buffer (Tris, 10 mmol/liter; MgSO4, 20 mmol/liter;dl-dithiothreitol, 2 mmol/liter; pH 7.5, 37 °C) supplemented with 20 μg of PtdIns, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 200 μmol/liter ATP, and samples were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 150 μl of chloroform:methanol:HCl, 12 mol/liter (33:66:0.6). For lipid extraction, 120 μl of chloroform were added, and samples were centrifuged (20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C). The organic phase was washed by adding 150 μl of CH3OH/HCl, 1 mol/liter (1:1), 20 μl of HCl, 8 mol/liter, and 160 μl of CHCl3/CH3OH (1:1). After centrifugation (20,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C) the organic phase was evaporated under N2 and spotted on TLC plates. Plates were developed in CHCl3, CH3OH, H2O, 25% NH3 (60:47:11.3:2). Autoradiography and densitometry of spots representing the PI3K product, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, allowed calculation of PI3K activity. PKB/Akt activity in hepatic tissue was determined by an immunoblotting technique (27Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 28Webster C.R. Blanch C.J.

In brief, shock-frozen tissue (−80 °C) was homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (27Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar) (1 ml/100 mg of tissue) and processed as described (27Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Am. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 29754-29760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Aliquots were electrophoresed using sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Separated proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membranes and probed with phospho-PKB (AktSer-473) antibodies at a dilution of 1:1000 overnight to detect the activated form of PKB. Then membranes were stripped and reprobed with a PKB antibody (1:1000) to detect total PKB in an identical procedure. After the use of a goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:5000), a chemiluminescence reagent, and Hyperfilm ECL, the phospho-PKB and PKB bands were quantified by densitometry (NIH Image Densitometric Analysis 1.54; Bethesda, MD, 1994). Distribution of the protein kinase C isoform ε in hepatic tissue was determined by an immunoblotting technique exactly as described previously (6Beuers U. Bilzer M. Chittattu A. Kullak-Ublick G.A.

The PKC bands at 90 kDa (ε) were quantified by densitometry (NIH Image Densitometric Analysis 1.54; Bethesda, MD, 1994). Results were expressed as [(optical density of the particular fraction)/(total optical density of cytosol and membrane fraction)] × 100 (%). PDK-I activity in hepatic tissue was determined by use of a PDK-1 immunoprecipitation kinase assay kit (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY). In brief, shock-frozen liver tissue (100 mg/ml) was homogenized on ice in buffer A (Tris, 50 mmol/liter; Triton X-100, 0.1%; EDTA, 1 mmol/liter; EGTA, 1 mmol/liter; NaF, 50 mmol/liter; sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mmol/liter; Na4P2O7, 5 mmol/liter; Na3VO4, 1 mmol/liter; 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1%; H2O, 50 ml; pH 7.5, 4 °C) and further processed exactly following the assay protocol provided by the manufacturer. After immunoprecipitation of PDK-1 with anti-PDK-1 sheep immunoaffinity-purified IgG and protein G-agarose beads, PDK-1 activity was determined by phosphorylation and activation of recombinant serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) and SGK1-dependent phosphorylation of an Akt/SGK substrate peptide using [γ-32P]ATP. The phosphorylated substrate peptide was separated from residual [γ-32P]ATP using P81 phosphocellulose paper and quantitated using a scintillation counter. PDK-1 activity was expressed in arbitrary units (AU). Mean PDK-1 activity in control livers was set as 1.00 AU. Isolation and culture of rat hepatocyte couplets was performed as previously described (30Boyer J.L. Soroka C.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1600-1611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes (∼10 × 104 cells/cm2) containing glass coverslips and incubated at 37 °C in l-15 medium for 4 h in an air atmosphere. Bile acid secretion by IRHC was assessed by measuring the hepatocellular uptake and secretion of 1 μmol/liter cholylglycylamido fluorescein (CGamF) into the canalicular space as previously described (30Boyer J.L. Soroka C.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1600-1611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). CGamF was synthesized according to Schteingart et al.(31Schteingart D.C. Eming S. Ton-Nu H.T. Crombie D.L. Hofmann A.F. Paumgartner G. Stiehl A. Gerok W. Bile Acids and the Hepatobiliary System. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1994: 177-183Google Scholar) and was kindly provided by Dr. Alan Hofmann. Four hours after isolation, hepatocytes (on coverslips) were briefly transferred to HEPES buffer (30Boyer J.L. Soroka C.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1600-1611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Then, cells were pretreated for 15 min at 37 °C with (i) Me2SO (0.1%, v/v), (ii) 100 nmol/liter wortmannin and Me2SO, (iii) Me2SO for 5 min, and 2.5 μm TLCA (in Me2SO, 0.1%, v/v) for 10 min, (iv) 100 nmol/liter wortmannin and Me2SO for 5 min, and 100 nmol/liter wortmannin and 2.5 μm TLCA (in Me2SO, 0.1%, v/v) for 10 min, (v) Me2SO for 5 min and 5 μmol/liter TLCA (in Me2SO, 0.1%, v/v) for 10 min, and (vi) 100 nmol/liter wortmannin and Me2SO for 5 min, and 100 nmol/liter wortmannin and 5 μmol/liter TLCA for 10 min. Cells were then transferred for 5 min to HEPES buffer containing 1 μmol/liter fluorescent CGamF at 37 °C to allow adequate loading of the fluorescent bile acid and transferred back for 10 min to their previous dishes (i-vi). Hepatocyte secretion was stopped by placing coverslips in ice-cold HEPES buffer on ice, and cells were viewed immediately on a Zeiss LSM 510 microscope (Thornwood, NY). Laser settings were optimized for a dynamic range to avoid saturation of the fluorescence. The same settings were used for all conditions. Cells were analyzed on the confocal laser scanning microscope by one investigator (C. J. Soroka) who was blinded to the experimental conditions. Couplets were selected based upon the presence of a well defined canalicular space as determined under bright field optics. Images were then acquired with rapid scanning to avoid quenching of the fluorescence. Quantitation of uptake (uptake = (F° cell + F° can)/μm2) and secretion (% secretion = [F° can/(F° cell + F° can)] × 100) of CGamF was performed as previously published (30Boyer J.L. Soroka C.J. Gastroenterology. 1995; 109: 1600-1611Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), except that NIH Image software was used. PKB/Akt activity in isolated rat hepatocytes was determined by an immunoblotting technique (27Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar, 28Webster C.R.

In brief, 4 h after plating (see above) cells were incubated for 5, 15, 30, and 60 min with TLCA (5 μmol/liter; at concentrations >5 μmol/liter, TLCA caused visible damage in isolated hepatocytes in short term culture), TUDCA (10 μmol/liter), TCA (10 μmol/liter), or the carrier Me2SO only (control, 0.1%, v/v). Culture dishes were then placed on ice, and cells were scraped and immediately shock-frozen (−80 °C). Shock-frozen cells were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (27Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G1165-G1172PubMed Google Scholar) (1 ml/100 mg) and processed as described above (27Webster C.R. Anwer M.S. Am. J.

Results were compared between groups using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t test or ANOVA when indicated. p< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Bile flow was 1.0 ± 0.1 μl/min/g of liver (n = 47) after loading of livers with HRP for 25 min and a wash-out period of 5 min and remained stable for the following 50 min in control experiments (52.2 ± 4.4 μl/50 min/g of liver,n = 5) in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, 0.1%, v/v) (Fig.1A). Wortmannin (100 nmol/liter) did not affect bile flow under basal conditions (54.9 ± 5.1 μl/50min/g of liver, n = 5; Fig.1A). TLCA (10 μmol/liter) caused a decrease of bile flow to 18% of controls (9.5 ± 1.6 μl/50 min/g of liver,n = 6, p < 0.01; Fig. 1A). The TLCA-induced decrease of bile flow was partially reversed by wortmannin; bile flow was 50% (26.2 ± 3.0 μl/50 min/g of liver, n = 6, p < 0.01versus TLCA) and 47% (24.6 ± 3.5 μl/50 min/g of liver, n = 5, p < 0.01versus TLCA) of controls when wortmannin was administered at 100 nmol/liter and 500 nmol/liter, respectively (Fig. 1A). TUDCA (25 μmol/liter) increased bile flow to 139% that of controls (72.7 ± 16.1 μl/50 min/g of liver, n = 5,p < 0.05, Fig.2A). Wortmannin did not affect TUDCA-induced bile flow (73.7 ± 14.4 μl/50 min/g of liver,n = 5; Fig. 2A). TUDCA reversed TLCA-induced impairment of bile flow (57.4 ± 12.8 μl/50 min/g of liver,n = 5, p < 0.05 versusTLCA; Fig. 2A). Wortmannin (100 nmol/liter) and TUDCA additively counteracted TLCA-induced impairment of bile flow (83.9 ± 10.3 μl/50 min/g of liver, n = 5;p < 0.05 versus control and TUDCA+TLCA; Fig. 2A). Thus, the PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, did not affect basal and TUDCA-induced bile flow but partly reversed TLCA-induced inhibition of bile flow. Wortmannin and TUDCA exerted additive anticholestatic effects.Figure 2The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin (100 nmol/liter), and the anticholestatic bile acid, TUDCA, additively counteract TLCA-induced impairment of bile flow (A) and biliary secretion (B) of HRP in the isolated perfused rat liver (for experimental details, see “Experimental Procedures,” “Protocol I”). Livers were preloaded with HRP. After a wash-out phase of 5 min, TUDCA (25 μmol/liter; ■), TUDCA (25 μmol/liter) + wortmannin (Wo; 100 nmol/liter; ▪), TUDCA (25 μmol/liter) + TLCA (10 μmol/liter; ⋄), and TUDCA (25 μmol/liter) + wortmannin (100 nmol/liter) + TLCA (10 μmol/liter; ♦) were administered for 50 min.

https://openalex.org/W2133133728,"The effects of neonatal dexamethasone (DEX) treatment on spatial learning and hippocampal synaptic plasticity were investigated in adult rats. Spatial learning in reference and working memory versions of the Morris maze was impaired in DEX-treated rats. In hippocampal slices of DEX rats, long-term depression was facilitated and potentiation was impaired. Paired-pulse facilitation was normal, suggesting a postsynaptic defect as cause of the learning and plasticity deficits. Western blot analysis of hippocampal postsynaptic densities (PSD) revealed a reduction in NR2B subunit protein, whereas the abundance of the other major N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits (NR1, NR2A), AMPA receptor subunits (GluR2/3), scaffolding proteins, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (alphaCaMKII) were unaltered. This selective reduction in NR2B likely resulted from altered receptor assembly rather than subunit expression, because the abundance of NR2B in the homogenate and crude synaptosomal fractions was unaltered. In addition, the activity of alphaCaMKII, an NMDA receptor complex associated protein kinase, was increased in PSD of DEX rats. The results indicate that neonatal treatment with DEX causes alterations in composition and function of the hippocampal NMDA receptor complex that persist into adulthood. These alterations likely explain the deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and spatial learning induced by neonatal DEX treatment."
https://openalex.org/W1965533264,"The type 1 sodium-hydrogen exchanger (NHE-1) is a ubiquitous electroneutral membrane transporter that is activated by hypertonicity in many cells. NHE-1 may be an important pathway for Na+ entry during volume restoration, yet the molecular mechanisms underlying the osmotic regulation of NHE-1 are poorly understood. In the present study we conducted a screen for important signaling molecules that could be involved in hypertonicity-induced activation of NHE-1 in CHO-K1 cells. Hypertonicity rapidly activated NHE-1 in a concentration-dependent manner as assessed by proton microphysiometry and by measurements of intracellular pH on a FLIPRTM (fluorometric imagingplate reader). Inhibitors of Ca2+/calmodulin (CaM) and Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) attenuated this activation, whereas neither calcium chelation nor inhibitors of protein kinase C, the Ras-ERK1/2 pathway, Src kinase, and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent enzymes had significant effects. Hypertonicity also resulted in the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2 and STAT3 (the major substrate of Jak2) and CaM. Phosphorylation of Jak2 and CaM were blocked by AG490, an inhibitor of Jak2. Immunoprecipitation studies showed that hypertonicity stimulates the assembly of a signaling complex that includes CaM, Jak2, and NHE-1. Formation of the complex could be blocked by AG490. Thus, we propose that hypertonicity induces activation of NHE-1 in CHO-K1 cells in large part through the following pathway: hypertonicity → Jak2 phosphorylation and activation → tyrosine phosphorylation of CaM → association of CaM with NHE-1 → NHE-1 activation.

Despite the potential importance of this process, the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of NHE-1 by hypertonicity have not been fully elucidated.

Nehrke K. Choi J. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31349-31356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, deletion of the major phosphorylation sites contained within residues 636–815 of NHE-1 only reduces its response to growth factors by about 507 (6Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Shigekawa M. Fafournoux P. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5583-5588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that mechanisms of regulation other than direct phosphorylation of NHE-1 are also important. Hypertonicity-induced shrinkage of mammalian cells is a powerful stimulant for many protein kinases that could play important direct or indirect roles in activating NHE-1. These include mitogen-activated protein kinases such as extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), stress-activated protein kinases (c-Jun N-terminal kinases) (7Matsuda S. Kawasaki H.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although there is not a consensus that any of those kinases mediate hypertonicity-induced activation of NHE-1. Hypertonicity induces rapid cellular shrinkage and activation of NHE-1 and, concomitantly, extensive tyrosine phosphorylation of members of the Src family of tyrosine kinases p59fgr and p56/59hck but not stress-activated protein kinase, p38, or ERK1/2 (11Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In that regard, ERK, stress-activated protein kinase, and p38 do not appear to be involved in the activation of NHE-1 in human neutrophils or lung fibroblasts (9Bianchini L. L'Allemain G. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 271-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 11Krump E. Nikitas K. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17303-17311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Cell shrinkage associated with hypertonic exposure induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins of ∼ 40, 80–85, and 110–130 kDa in CHO cells (16Szaszi K. Buday L. Kapus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16670-16678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 40-kDa protein appears to be ERK2, although this enzyme was not shown to be involved in the shrinkage-induced stimulation of NHE-1 (16Szaszi K. Buday L. Kapus A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16670-16678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The 80–85-kDa protein was later identified as cortactin (cortical actin filament cross-linking protein), a major target of the hypertonicity-stimulated Src family kinase Fyn (17Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, Src family kinases did not appear to be responsible for the hypertonic regulation of NHE-1 (17Kapus A. Szaszi K. Sun J. Rizoli S. Rotstein O.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8093-8102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The calmodulin (CaM)-dependent myosin light chain kinase is involved in shrinkage-induced activation of the NHE in astrocytes (18Shrode L.D. Klein J.D. O'Neill W.C. Putnam R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C257-C266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Shrode L.D. Klein J.D. Douglas P.B. O'Neill W.C. Putnam R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1968-C1979Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is contradictory evidence about a potential role for protein kinase C (PKC) in hypertonicity-induced activation of NHE. In Ehrlich ascites tumor cells, PKC inhibitors block hypertonicity-induced activation of NHE (12Pedersen S.F. Kramhoft B. Jorgensen N.K. Hoffmann E.K. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 141-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), whereas in lymphocytes (20Grinstein S. Rothstein A. Cohen S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1985; 85: 765-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and in astrocytes (18Shrode L.D. Klein J.D. O'Neill W.C. Putnam R.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C257-C266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), PKC-dependent pathways are not involved in this process. The activation of NHE-1 by hypertonic challenge does not appear to involve direct phosphorylation of the exchanger itself (3Grinstein S. Woodside M. Sardet C. Pouyssegur J. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23823-23828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is because NHE-1 is still activated in response to hypertonic stress in cells transfected with truncated mutants of NHE-1 that lack all of its putative phosphorylation sites (21Bianchini L. Kapus A. Lukacs G. Wasan S. Wakabayashi S. Pouyssegur J., Yu, F.H. Orlowski J. Grinstein S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C998-C1007Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is somewhat difficult to reconcile that finding with other reports supporting a general role for phosphorylation in the activation of NHE-1. A possible explanation that could reconcile the differences in those reports would be phosphorylation of ancillary regulatory proteins involved in the hypertonicity-induced stimulation of NHE-1. One such protein is CaM, which has been shown to be important in the activation of NHE-1 by multiple distinct stimuli (22Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Wakabayashi S. Bertrand B. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13710-13715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion of a high affinity CaM binding domain has been shown to inhibit hypertonicity-induced activation of NHE-1 by up to 807, suggesting that CaM is a key regulator of shrinkage-induced activation of NHE (22Bertrand B. Wakabayashi S. Ikeda T. Pouyssegur J. Shigekawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13703-13709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently explored the interactions between CaM and phosphorylation reactions in the process of activation of NHE-1 by the G protein- and phospholipase C-linked bradykinin B2 receptor in cultured mIMCD-3 cells. We proposed the existence of a novel pathway through which Jak2 (activated by the B2 receptor) indirectly increases the activity of NHE-1 by inducing tyrosine phosphorylation of CaM, leading to increased binding of CaM to NHE-1 (24Mukhin Y.V. Vlasova T. Jaffa A.A. Collinsworth G. Bell J.L. Tholanikunnel B.G. Pettus T. Fitzgibbon W. Ploth D.W. Raymond J.R. Garnovskaya M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17339-17346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that this new pathway might also mediate hypertonicity-induced activation of NHE-1. This possibility is plausible in that hypertonicity has been shown previously (15Gatsios P. Terstegen L. Schliess F. Haussinger D. Kerr I.M. Heinrich P.C. Graeve L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22962-22968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) to activate the Jak/STAT pathway. Thus, in the current report, we studied the roles of CaM and Jak2 in the activation of NHE-1 by hypertonicity in CHO-K1 cells. Our results demonstrate that this pathway may be a fundamental mechanism for the rapid regulation of NHE-1 in multiple cell types.

CHO-K1 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Polycarbonate cell culture inserts for microphysiometry and black 96-well microtiter plates needed for the FLIPRTM were from Corning Costar (Cambridge, MA). Black pipette tips were from Molecular Devices Corporation (Sunnyvale, CA). DNA constructs were obtained from the following sources: minigene encoding the C-terminal residues of औ-adrenergic receptor kinase (औARK-CT) and Csk were from Dr. R. Lefkowitz (Duke University), dominant negative Ras (N17Ras) was from Drs. D. Aultschuler and M. Ostrowski (Columbus, OH), and dominant negative Raf (ΔNRaf) was from Dr. L. T. Williams (San Francisco, CA). CHO-K1 cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum, 10 mg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 400 ॖg/ml G-418 at 37 °C in a 57 CO2-enriched, humidified atmosphere. Transient expression of the cDNA constructs was achieved in CHO-K1 cells by transfection with 1 ॖg of the various plasmids in the presence of 10–15 ॖl of LipofectAMINE™ (2 h in serum- and antibiotic-free medium) as described previously (25Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y. Raymond J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency (>907) was evaluated by co-transfecting with 0.2 ॖg of cDNA encoding a green fluorescent protein (Clontech) as a marker. The microphysiometer uses a light addressable silicon sensor to detect extracellular protons (26McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Each of eight channels has two inlet ports for buffers, one of which usually contains a vehicle control, and the other of which carries the test substance. The cells are superfused with buffer, and valve switches and stop-start cycles are totally controlled by a programmable computer. Acidification rate data are transformed by a personal computer running Cytosoft™ version 2.0, and are presented as the extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) in ॖV/s, which roughly correspond to millipH (designation for pH unit/1000) units/min (Nernst equation). To facilitate comparison of data between two channels, values are typically expressed as a percentage of a baseline determined by computerized analysis of the five data points prior to exposure of the cell monolayers to a test substance. For all of the experiments, CHO-K1 cells were plated onto polycarbonate membranes (3-ॖm pore size, 12-mm size) at a density of 300,000 cells per insert the night prior to experimentation. After cells were attached to the membranes, they were growth-arrested in serum-free culture medium for 20 h before the experiment. The day of the study, cells were washed with serum-free, bicarbonate-free Ham's F-12 medium, placed into the microphysiometer chambers, and perfused at 37 °C with the same medium or balanced salt solutions. For most studies, the pump cycle was set to perfuse cells for 60 s, followed by a 30 s “pump-off” phase, during which proton efflux was measured from the eighth through the twenty-eighth seconds. Cells were exposed to the test agent for three or four cycles (270–360 s). Valve switches (to add or remove test agents) were performed at the middle of the pump cycle. Data points were then acquired every 90 s. The peak effect during stimulation was expressed as the percentage increase from baseline. We used a FLIPR™ fluorometric imaging plate reader system (27Schroeder K.S. Neagle B.D. J. Biomol. Screen. 1996; 1: 75-80Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) to measure intracellular pH in CHO-K1 cells. Cells were seeded (∼ 50,000 cells/well) in 96-well clear bottom black microplates (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) and left overnight in CO2 incubator at 37 °C. On the day of assay, cells were loaded with a dye (5 ॖm BCECF acetoxymethyl ester) in a loading buffer (Hank's balanced salt solution, pH 7.4, containing 20 mmHEPES, 2.5 mm probenecid) for 1 h at 37 °C. 20 min before the end of the loading phase, 20 mmNH4Cl was added to each well. Cells were then washed four times with the loading buffer containing 20 mmNH4Cl. In the FLIPRTM, cells were acid-loaded by an ammonium chloride prepulse protocol. In this method, the extracellular buffer contains NH4+ and NH3 in an equilibrium that is essentially recapitulated in the cell interior. When the extracellular medium is changed to a buffer lacking NH4Cl, intracellular NH3 diffuses rapidly out of the cell, causing the cells to become acutely loaded with protons donated from NH4+(28Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: C61-C73Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some cells were pretreated with 1 ॖm EIPA for 10 min. Cells were allowed to recover from the acid load in the presence and absence of sodium and various test substances. Fluorescence excitation was obtained using an Argon laser (488 nm wavelength at 300 mW), and emission (∼540 nm) was monitored kinetically (29Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). We also performed experiments without the acid load. Cells in 96-well plates were loaded with BCECF for 1 h. Negative control wells were pretreated with 5 ॖm EIPA for 10–20 min. Plates were placed in the FLIPRTM, and fluorescence tracings were recorded in the presence or absence of different concentrations of sucrose. The tracings from at least six wells under the same conditions were averaged, and tracings from the negative controls were subtracted. The slopes of fluorescence changes were calculated as rate fluorescence change (fluorescence counts per second). Quiescent CHO-K1 cell monolayers were treated with hypertonic media or vehicle for 10 min and lysed in 1 ml/100-mm dish of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 17 Nonidet P-40, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin at 1 ॖg/ml of each). Cell lysates were pre-cleared by incubating with a protein A-agarose bead slurry for 30 min at 4 °C. Pre-cleared lysates (1 ॖg/ॖl total cell protein) were incubated with anti-Jak2/protein A-agarose, with anti-NHE-1 antibody or with polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody overnight at 4 °C. Phosphotyrosine and NHE-1 immunoprecipitates were captured by addition of protein A-agarose. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed three times with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer, resuspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and subsequent immunoblot analysis with monoclonal anti-CaM or anti-phosphotyrosine IgG. The same Western blots were re-probed with the antibody used for immunoprecipitation to assure that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane. Phosphorylation of Jak2 in response to hypertonic medium was assessed using a Jak2 dual phosphospecific antibody. Quiescent cells were treated with hypertonic medium for 10 min and lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer. The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions with 4–207 pre-cast gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). After semi-dry transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, membranes were blocked with a Blotto buffer and incubated with the phospho-Jak2 antibody (0.5 ॖg/ml). After incubation with alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies immunoreactive bands were visualized by a chemiluminescent method (CDP StarTM; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) using pre-flashed Kodak X-AR film and quantified using a GS-670 densitometer and Molecular Analyst software (Bio-Rad). Alternatively, bands were visualized with a Storm™ PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To ensure that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane, blots were stripped and re-probed with control Jak2 antibody, which recognizes both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Jak2 equally. STAT3 phosphorylation was assessed using a phospho-specific STAT3 (Tyr705) antibody, which specifically detects STAT3 only when activated by phosphorylation at Tyr705. Cells were treated with NaCl or sucrose, harvested in Laemmli buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions with 4–207 pre-cast gels (Novex). After semi-dry transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, membranes were blocked with a Blotto buffer and incubated with the phospho-STAT3 antibody at a 1:1000 dilution. After incubation with alkaline phosphatase-linked secondary antibodies, immunoreactive bands were visualized using Vistra ECF Western blotting system (Amersham Biosciences) and a Storm™ PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). To ensure that equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane, blots were stripped and re-probed with control STAT3 antibody, which recognizes total (phosphorylation-state independent) levels of STAT3 protein. Data were analyzed for repeated measures by Student's t test for unpaired two-tailed analysis. p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. We used a Cytosensor™ microphysiometer (Molecular Devices Corporation, Sunnyvale, CA) (26McConnell H.M. Owicki J.C. Parce J.W. Miller D.L. Baxter G.T. Wada H.G. Pitchford S. Science. 1992; 257: 1906-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar) to measure proton efflux from intact monolayers of CHO-K1 cells plated onto polycarbonate membranes. We have used the microphysiometer previously to specifically study Na+/H+ exchange in fibroblasts (25Garnovskaya M.N. Mukhin Y. Raymond J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 30Garnovskaya M.N. Gettys T.W. van Biesen T. Prpic V. Chuprun J.K. Raymond J.R. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1998; 275: G689-G695PubMed Google Scholar), and polarized epithelial mIMCD-3 cells (24Mukhin Y.V. Vlasova T. Jaffa A.A. Collinsworth G. Bell J.L. Tholanikunnel B.G. Pettus T. Fitzgibbon W.

Fig.1A shows that cells treated with media made hypertonic (450 mosmol/liter) by addition of NaCl (closed circles) or sucrose (open circles) to isotonic medium had rapid >707 increases in ECAR. Fig. 1B shows that the stimulatory effect of sucrose occurred in sodium-containing balanced salt solution but not in a solution in which tetramethylammonium was substituted for sodium. Pretreatment of cells for 30 min with 1 ॖm of the NHE-1 inhibitor, EIPA, did not affect the basal rate of extracellular acidification but greatly attenuated the increase in ECAR caused by hypertonic treatment. Thus, the increased ECAR induced by exposure to hypertonic media was both sodium-dependent and inhibitable by an NHE inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of NHE-1 (CHO-K1 cells only express NHE-1). In some experiments, cells were perfused with a buffer in which pyruvate was substituted for glucose to minimize the effects of glycolysis on ECAR. Under these conditions, medium made hypertonic by the addition of sucrose increased ECAR by ∼857 (Fig.1B). To support our microphysiometry data, we used another method of studying NHE activity by measuring intracellular pH using BCECF fluorescence on a FLIPRTM. Cells were acid-loaded by the ammonium chloride prepulse method as described under “Experimental Procedures” and then were allowed to recover in the presence or absence of different concentrations of sucrose with or without the addition of EIPA. Those experiments showed that sucrose increases the rate of recovery from acid load in a concentration-dependent manner (not shown). We also monitored NHE-1 activation on a FLIPRTM without an acid load to more closely approximate the measurement conditions used in the microphysiometry experiments. The results presented in Fig.1C demonstrate a concentration-dependent increase in the rate of fluorescence change after stimulation of cells with media made hypertonic by addition of sucrose. Thus, media made hypertonic by addition of NaCl or sucrose activate NHE-1 in CHO-K1 cells as measured by two independent assays. Further, hypertonicity-induced changes in ECAR are due nearly completely to the activation of NHE-1 independent of glycolysis-mediated production of protons. Fig.2 shows studies in which various inhibitors were examined for effects on hypertonicity-stimulated ECAR in CHO-K1 cells. Typically, cells were perfused for 15–30 min with media containing chemical inhibitors of signaling molecules and then exposed to hypertonic medium (400 mosmol/liter by addition of sucrose or NaCl to isotonic medium) in the presence of inhibitors. Control cells were pretreated only with vehicle. We also used cells transiently transfected with inhibitory negative constructs of potential signaling molecules, whereas cells transfected with an empty vector served as a control. Our previous work has shown a role for Giα2and Giα3 in the G protein-coupled receptor stimulation of NHE-1 in CHO-K1 cells (30Garnovskaya M.N. Gettys T.W. van Biesen T. Prpic V. Chuprun J.K. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A role for G protein औγ subunits in the activation of an endogenous NHE in Xenopus laevis oocytes has also been demonstrated by others (32Busch S. Wieland T. Esche H. Jakobs K.H. Siffert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17898-17901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested a role for G protein औγ subunits and Giα subunits in hypertonicity-induced activation of NHE. Pertussis toxin (200 ng/ml for 18 h) failed to inhibit NHE under hypertonic conditions, suggesting that pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein α subunits are not involved in hypertonicity-induced activation of NHE (Fig. 2A). Such treatment completely blocked the increase in NHE activity induced by recombinant 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor, which activates NHE-1 through pertussis toxin-sensitive Giα2and Giα3 subunits (30Garnovskaya M.N. Gettys T.W. van Biesen T. Prpic V. Chuprun J.K. Raymond J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Likewise, sequestration of G protein औγ subunits by transfecting cells with a minigene construct that encodes औARK-CT does not inhibit the NHE activation by hypertonicity, showing a lack of involvement of G protein औγ subunits in this process (Fig. 2A). The expression of औARK-CT in CHO-K1 cells was demonstrated by performing Western blots on cell lysates with antibody specific for औARK-1 (not shown). This expressed protein was also functionally active, because it completely prevented activation of ERK1/2 by the recombinant 5-hydroxytryptamine1A receptor in CHO-K1 cells (33Garnovskaya M.N."
https://openalex.org/W1551542801,"In the present report, we investigated the effect of ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50) expression on the agonist-induced internalization of the thromboxane A2 β receptor (TPβ receptor). Interestingly, we found that EBP50 almost completely blocked TPβ receptor internalization, which could not be reversed by overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases and arrestins. Because we recently demonstrated that EBP50 can bind to and inhibit Gαq, we next studied whether Gαq signaling could induce TPβ receptor internalization, addressing the long standing question about the relationship between GPCR signaling and their internalization. Expression of a constitutively active Gαq mutant (Gαq-R183C) resulted in a robust internalization of the TPβ receptor, which was unaffected by expression of dominant negative mutants of arrestin-2 and -3, but inhibited by expression of EBP50 or dynamin-K44A, a dominant negative mutant of dynamin. Phospholipase Cβ and protein kinase C did not appear to significantly contribute to internalization of the TPβ receptor, suggesting that Gαq induces receptor internalization through a phospholipase Cβ- and protein kinase C-independent pathway. Surprisingly, there appears to be specificity in Gα protein-mediated GPCR internalization. Gαq-R183C also induced the internalization of CXCR4 (Gαq-coupled), whereas it failed to do so for the β2-adrenergic receptor (Gαs-coupled). Moreover, Gαs-R201C, a constitutively active form of Gαs, had no effect on internalization of the TPβ, CXCR4, and β2-adrenergic receptors. Thus, we showed that Gα protein signaling can lead to internalization of GPCRs, with specificity in both the Gα proteins and GPCRs that are involved. Furthermore, a new function has been described for EBP50 in its capacity to inhibit receptor endocytosis. In the present report, we investigated the effect of ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50 (EBP50) expression on the agonist-induced internalization of the thromboxane A2 β receptor (TPβ receptor). Interestingly, we found that EBP50 almost completely blocked TPβ receptor internalization, which could not be reversed by overexpression of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) kinases and arrestins. Because we recently demonstrated that EBP50 can bind to and inhibit Gαq, we next studied whether Gαq signaling could induce TPβ receptor internalization, addressing the long standing question about the relationship between GPCR signaling and their internalization. Expression of a constitutively active Gαq mutant (Gαq-R183C) resulted in a robust internalization of the TPβ receptor, which was unaffected by expression of dominant negative mutants of arrestin-2 and -3, but inhibited by expression of EBP50 or dynamin-K44A, a dominant negative mutant of dynamin. Phospholipase Cβ and protein kinase C did not appear to significantly contribute to internalization of the TPβ receptor, suggesting that Gαq induces receptor internalization through a phospholipase Cβ- and protein kinase C-independent pathway. Surprisingly, there appears to be specificity in Gα protein-mediated GPCR internalization. Gαq-R183C also induced the internalization of CXCR4 (Gαq-coupled), whereas it failed to do so for the β2-adrenergic receptor (Gαs-coupled). Moreover, Gαs-R201C, a constitutively active form of Gαs, had no effect on internalization of the TPβ, CXCR4, and β2-adrenergic receptors. Thus, we showed that Gα protein signaling can lead to internalization of GPCRs, with specificity in both the Gα proteins and GPCRs that are involved. Furthermore, a new function has been described for EBP50 in its capacity to inhibit receptor endocytosis.

Many proteins have been shown to regulate the different GPCR-related signaling pathways through the direct regulation of the G protein activity (1Hollinger S. Hepler J.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 527-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Following agonist binding, many GPCRs undergo agonist-induced phosphorylation, internalization, and down-regulation, resulting in a decrease of their responsiveness (desensitization) (2Tsao P. Von Zastrow M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 91-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Our studies are mainly interested in the mechanisms that regulate the signaling and the internalization of the thromboxane A2 receptor (TP receptor). Two TP receptor isoforms were identified which are generated by the alternative splicing of a single gene, TPα (343 amino acids) and TPβ (407 amino acids), which share the first 328 amino acids (3Hirata M.

Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) demonstrated that only TPβ, but not TPα, undergoes agonist-induced and tonic (constitutive) internalizations, which are dictated by distinct motifs in the C terminus of the TPβ receptor. Different experiments showed that agonist-induced production of the second messenger inositol phosphate by the TP receptors results from the activation of the Gq/11 family of the Gα subunits (6Kinsella B.T. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 641-654Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Gαq-mediated production of inositol phosphates involves the stimulation of phospholipase C-β (PLC-β) isoforms (7Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that the ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein EBP50 regulates the Gαq signaling pathway of the TP receptors (8Rochdi M.D. Watier V. La Madeleine C. Nakata H. Kozasa T. Parent J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40751-40759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We showed that EBP50 binds preferentially to the active form of Gαq and thus diminishes the Gαq-induced inositol phosphates production on the one hand by inhibiting the interaction of the activated Gαqwith PLCβ-1, and on the other hand by preventing the coupling of the TP receptors to Gαq (8Rochdi M.D. Watier V. La Madeleine C. Nakata H. Kozasa T. Parent J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40751-40759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). EBP50 (also known as NHERF1), a 55-kDa phosphoprotein, was first identified as a cofactor essential for protein kinase A-mediated inhibition of Na+/H+ exchanger isoform 3 (9Weinman E.J. Steplock D. Wang Y. Shenolikar S. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2143-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). EBP50 contains two PDZ domains (PDZ1 and PDZ2) implicated in multiple protein-protein interactions, and an ERM domain, which binds to the actin-associated ERM proteins (ezrin, radixin, moesin, and merlin) (10Murthy A. Gonzalez-Agosti C. Cordero E. Pinney D. Candia C. Solomon F. Gusella J. Ramesh V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1273-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar,11Reczek D. Berryman M. Bretscher A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 169-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). EBP50 has been found to interact with a variety of proteins, and these interactions are involved in a growing range of functions including the assembly of signaling complexes, receptor recycling, and transport of membrane proteins to the cell surface (12Shenolikar S. Weinman E.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: F389-F395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, Caoet al. (13Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Zastrow M.V. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) have shown that EBP50 participates in GPCR trafficking by demonstrating its involvement in the recycling back to the cell surface of the β2-adrenergic receptor following its agonist-induced internalization. However, there is still no evidence that EBP50 can regulate the internalization of GPCRs. It has long been assumed that ligand binding to GPCRs is the ultimate control to their internalization and trafficking. However, recent studies bring about a new concept of the tight regulation of GPCRs internalization pathways by diverse signaling cascades (14Cavalli V. Corti M. Gruenberg J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In fact, many signaling molecules including the small G proteins Rho, Rab, and ARF6, as well as different phosphoinositide molecules, have been shown to regulate the endocytic pathways by either controlling the actin cytoskeleton organization or by mediating clathrin-coated pit formation, as reviewed by Cavalli et al. (14Cavalli V. Corti M. Gruenberg J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 498: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). One of the questions often asked in GPCR regulation is whether GPCR signaling is necessary for GPCR internalization. Evidence gathered over the years by several groups suggests that there is no clear answer to that question and that it may depend on the GPCR and the signaling pathways that are studied. Several GPCR mutants unable to activate their cognate G proteins could still internalize, whereas the opposite was also observed, signaling-deficient GPCRs were unable to undergo agonist-induced internalization (15Conchon S. Peltier N. Corvol P. Clauser E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E336-E345PubMed Google Scholar). In most cases, however, effects of the mutations on the receptor signaling were determined for only one signaling pathway even though a given GPCR can sometimes couple to more than one type of Gα subunit. Moreover, different studies using constitutively active GPCR mutants suggest a possible link between receptor signaling and internalization. Indeed, many such mutations seem to affect cellular distributions of various GPCRs by decreasing their cell surface expression levels, resulting in their intracellular localization (16Miserey-Lenkei S. Parnot C. Bardin S. Corvol P. Clauser E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5891-5901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 17Li J. Chen C. Huang P. Liu-Chen L.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which can be reversed by the addition of an inverse agonist (17Li J. Chen C. Huang P. Liu-Chen L.Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2001; 60: 1064-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Even if there is evidence of a link between the constitutive signaling activity of some GPCRs and their constitutive internalization, it is not yet clear whether this internalization is the result of activation of the signaling cascades or simply of the active conformation adopted by the constitutively active receptors. In other words, it is not well understood whether GPCR conformational changes triggered by the binding of the agonist are sufficient and necessary to the internalization of different GPCRs or whether the subsequent activation of the signaling cascades plays an important role in initiating the internalization pathways. On the other hand, it has been shown that heterologous activation of protein kinase C (PKC) results in the phosphorylation and internalization of the CXCR4 (18Orsini M.J. Parent J.L. Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Marchese A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and the δ-opioid receptors (19Xiang B., Yu, G.H. Guo J. Chen L. Hu W. Pei G. Ma L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4709-4716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that activation of intracellular signaling induces the agonist-independent internalization of some GPCRs. However, there is still no or little evidence for the direct involvement of Gα protein signaling in the control of internalization pathways. In the present study, we demonstrate that Gα protein signaling can induce GPCR internalization. In fact, inhibition of Gαqsignaling almost completely blocked the agonist-induced internalization of the TPβ receptor. Surprisingly, we show that there is specificity in this phenomenon. Indeed, Gαq signaling leads to Gαq-, but not Gαs-, coupled receptor internalization, whereas Gαs signaling does not trigger internalization of the GPCRs that we studied. The Gαq-mediated internalization was determined to occur by an arrestin-, PLC-, and PKC-independent, but dynamin-dependent mechanism and was completely abrogated by EBP50. Gαq/11, Gαs, and PLCβ1-specific polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Hemagglutinin (HA)-specific monoclonal antibody was fromBabco. ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Flag-specific monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma, whereas the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Texas Red goat anti-rabbit antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. The goat anti-mouse alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated antibody and the alkaline phosphatase substrate kit were purchased from Bio-Rad. HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Transient transfections of HEK293 cells grown to 75–90% confluence were performed using FuGENE 6TMaccording to the instructions from the manufacturer. Empty pcDNA3 vector was added to keep the total DNA amount added per plate constant. Cells grown on 60-mm plates were transfected using 6 μg of total DNA vectors. Cell surface expression and internalization of CXCR4, TPβ, and β2AR were assessed by ELISA experiments using transiently transfected HEK293 cells as we have described previously (5Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.2 × 106 cells were grown overnight in 60-mm plates. The cells were then transfected with empty pcDNA3 vector or cotransfected with pcDNA3HA-TPβ, pcDNA3-Flag-TPβ, pcDNA3-Flag-TPβ(Y339A), pcDNA3HACXCR4, pcDNA3-HA- β2AR, or pcDNA3-Flag-β2AR with pcDNA3-HA-EBP50, pcDNA3-HA-EBP50(PDZ1-PDZ2), pcDNA3-dynamin-K44A, pcDNA3Gαq-R183C, pcDNA3-arrestin-3, pcDNA3-GRK2, pcDNA3-GRK5, pcDNA3-arrestin-3-(201–409) (DN), or pcDNA3-arrestin-2-(319–418) (DN). Transfected cells were maintained as described above for 24 h. Thereafter, 2 × 105cells were transferred to 24-well plates precoated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine and were maintained for an additional 24 h. To assess the agonist-induced or PMA-induced internalization, the transfected cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline followed by a 2-h stimulation at 37 °C with 100 nmU46619 or 1 μm PMA in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, except for the cells that were cotransfected with the receptors described above and pcDNA3-Gαq-R183C. The cells were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde plus TBS for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed three times with TBS and nonspecific binding blocked with TBS containing 1% BSA for 45 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with either a HA-specific (Babco) or the Flag M1-specific (Sigma) monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:1000 in TBS/BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Three washes with TBS buffer followed, and cells were briefly reblocked for 15 min at room temperature. Incubation with goat anti-mouse conjugated alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:1000 was carried out for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed three times with TBS, and a colorimetric alkaline phosphatase substrate was added as specified by the manufacturer. The resulting colorimetric reactions were measured using a Titertek MultisKan MCC/340 spectrophotometer. Cells transfected with pcDNA3 were studied concurrently to determine background. All experiments were done in triplicate. TPβ(Y339A) (a receptor mutant defective in constitutive internalization) internalization was assessed with immunofluorescence microscopy. 1.2 × 106 HEK293 cells were grown overnight in 60-mm plates as described above. The cells were then transfected with an empty pcDNA3 vector or cotransfected with pcDNA3-HA-TPβ(Y339A) (a receptor mutant specifically deficient in constitutive internalization) and either an empty pcDNA3 vector or pcDNA3-Gαq-R183C and maintained overnight as described above. Then 2 × 105 cells were transferred on coverslips and further grown overnight. Cells were incubated with an HA-specific monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution) for 1 h at 4 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% BSA, followed by a 2-h incubation at 37 °C. The cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde plus PBS for 30 min at room temperature, washed with PBS/CaCl2, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS for 10 min at room temperature. Nonspecific binding was blocked with 0.1% Triton X-100 plus PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature. Goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes) was then added at a dilution of 1:200 for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were washed six times with permeabilization buffer, with the last wash left at room temperature for 30 min. Finally, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde as described. Coverslips were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and examined by immunofluorescence microscopy on a Zeiss Axioskop2 microscope using a 40× objective. Images were collected using QED Camera software and processed with Adobe Photoshop. PMA-induced phosphorylation of the TPβ receptor was assessed essentially as we described previously (18Orsini M.J. Parent J.L. Mundell S.J. Benovic J.L. Marchese A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31076-31086Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). 3.5 × 105 HEK293 cells were grown overnight in six-well plates as described above and transfected the following day with an empty pcDNA3 vector or with pcDNA3-Myc-TPβ. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed once with TBS and incubated for 2 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5 μCi/ml32Pi at 37 °C (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The cells were then incubated in the presence or absence of 1 μm GF109203X (a PKC inhibitor) for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by a 30-min stimulation with 1 μm PMA at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with cold TBS and harvested in 800 μl of lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mm Na2P2O7, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitors (9 nm pepstatin, 9 nm antipain, 10 nmleupeptin, and 10 nm chymostatin) (Sigma). After the cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 60 min at 4 °C, the lysates were clarified by centrifugation for 20 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Four μg of Myc-specific monoclonal antibody were added to the supernatant. After a 60-min incubation with rotation at 4 °C, 50 μl of 50% protein A-agarose pre-equilibrated in lysis buffer was added, followed by an overnight incubation at 4 °C with rotation. Samples were then centrifuged for 1 min in a microcentrifuge and washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer followed by a 30-min incubation at room temperature. The immunoprecipitates were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. Inositol phosphate measurements were performed as described previously (24da Rocha A.B. Mans D.R. Regner A. Schwartsmann G. Oncologist. 2002; 7: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells (2 × 105) were grown overnight in 12-well plates. The cells were then cotransfected as described above with the indicated constructs. The cells were labeled the following day for 18–24 h with 4 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol). The cells were washed once in PBS and incubated in prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose, without inositol) supplemented with 0.5% BSA, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 20 mm LiCl for 10 min. Cells were then stimulated for 30 min with 100 nmU46619 in the case of the TP receptor-transfected cells. After stimulation, the medium was removed and the reactions were terminated by addition of 0.8 ml of 0.4 m chilled perchloric acid. Cells were then collected in Eppendorf tubes, and 0.5 volume of 0.72 n KOH, 0.6 m KOHCO3was added. Tubes were mixed and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge. Inositol phosphates were separated on Bio-Rad AG1-X8 columns. Total labeled inositol phosphates were then measured by liquid scintillation counting. Data are presented as means ± S.E. of at least three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences among groups were assessed by t test for paired samples, with p values < 0.05 sufficient to reject the null hypothesis. We have already shown that EBP50 inhibits TPβ signaling through the Gαqpathway by both preventing the receptor coupling to Gαqand by sequestration of GTP-bound Gαq blocking it from binding and activating PLCβ-1 (8Rochdi M.D. Watier V. La Madeleine C. Nakata H. Kozasa T. Parent J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40751-40759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We then investigated the role of EBP50 in the agonist-induced internalization of an HA-tagged TPβ receptor by the use of ELISA experiments, as we described previously (5Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we have found that EBP50 almost completely inhibited the agonist-induced internalization of the TPβ receptor, as shown in Fig. 1A. In fact, EBP50 inhibited the internalization of the TPβ receptor more efficiently than the dominant negative mutant form of dynamin, dynamin-K44A, which is deficient in GTP binding and known to block internalization of several membrane proteins (20Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). We had already demonstrated that agonist-induced internalization of the TPβ receptor is dynamin-dependent (5Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), and dynamin-K44A was thus included as a control to compare with. EBP50 has been shown to be involved in the control of the fate of internalized membrane proteins such as the β2-adrenergic receptors (13Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Zastrow M.V. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) by promoting their recycling to the cell surface membrane. We were thus interested in determining whether the apparent lack of TPβ receptor internalization in presence of EBP50 was not in fact caused by an increase in receptor recycling to the cell surface. Cao et al. (13Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Zastrow M.V. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) have shown that the ERM domain of EBP50 was necessary for promoting the recycling of the β2-adrenergic receptor and that a dominant negative mutant of EBP50 lacking the ERM domain was unable to enhance the recycling of this receptor. Similarly, data later published showed that the ERM domain of EBP50 was also necessary for the recycling of the κ-opioid receptor (21Li J.G. Chen C. Liu-Chen L.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27545-27552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, we used a PDZ1-PDZ2 construct (lacking the ERM domain) of EBP50 to investigate its effect on TPβ receptor internalization. As seen in Fig. 1A, we have found that this EBP50 mutant is still able to inhibit TPβ receptor internalization, strongly suggesting that the inhibition of TPβ receptor internalization by EBP50 could not be explained by an increase in the recycling of the TPβ receptor. We then verified the effect of EBP50 and its PDZ1-PDZ2 construct (lacking the ERM domain) on the agonist-induced internalization of the β2AR receptor to confirm that EBP50 was acting appropriately in our hands. The results obtained showed that, in the presence of EBP50, the agonist-induced internalization of the β2AR receptor decreased by 50%, whereas cotransfection of the PDZ1-PDZ2 construct (lacking the ERM domain) had no effect on β2AR receptor internalization (data not shown), indicating that the effect of EBP50 on the agonist-induced internalization of β2AR results from an increase in its recycling at the cell surface, as was elegantly shown by Cao et al. (13Cao T.T. Deacon H.W. Reczek D. Bretscher A. Zastrow M.V. Nature. 1999; 401: 286-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Moreover, as we illustrate in Fig.1B, pretreatment of cells with monensin had no effect on neither the EBP50 inhibition nor, as expected, on the dynamin-K44A inhibition of the agonist-induced TPβ receptor internalization. Monensin is known to inhibit cell surface membrane recycling activity (22Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G. Brown M.S. Cell. 1981; 24: 493-502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar), and we have shown it to inhibit TPβ receptor recycling in our laboratory. 2C. Thériault and J.-L. Parent, manuscript in preparation. Data presented so far strongly suggest that EBP50 inhibits the TPβ receptor internalization, rather than promoting its recycling back to the cell surface. To further demonstrate that EBP50 acts at the level of TPβ receptor internalization, we performed immunofluorescence microscopy experiments. In Fig. 1C, cells transfected with pcDNA3-HATPβ alone or with pcDNA3HATPβ and pcDNA3-EBP50myc were labeled at 4 °C with an anti-HA antibody prior to internalization experiments to allow for detection of only the receptors that are trafficking from the cell surface, as we described previously (5Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). After agonist stimulation, it can be seen that, in absence of EBP50, the TPβ receptors are internalized in intracellular compartments (Fig. 1C, top left panel). In contrast, receptor-associated fluorescence remained at the cell surface in presence of EBP50 following agonist treatment (Fig. 1C, bottom left panel), and this, for all the time points observed between 0 and 2 h of receptor stimulation (data not shown). Fig.1C further illustrates that EBP50 blocks TPβ receptor internalization. These observations were surprising in light of the known role of EBP50 in receptor recycling and transport of membrane proteins to the cell surface. Indeed, it has never been shown that EBP50 can inhibit the internalization of a GPCR. Therefore, we were then interested in investigating the mechanism involved in the inhibition of the TPβ receptor internalization by EBP50. Because we showed that the EBP50 inhibition mechanism of the TPβ receptor internalization did not involve the control of the TPβ receptor recycling, we then investigated the effect of EBP50 on the machinery known to participate in GPCR internalization. We previously demonstrated that the agonist-induced internalization of the TPβ receptor is GRK- as well as arrestin-dependent (5Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Therefore, we performed an ELISA experiment using HEK293 cells stably expressing HA-tagged TPβ receptors transfected with pcDNA3, pcDNA3-EBP50, pcDNA3-GRK2, pcDNA3-GRK5, pcDNA3arrestin-3, and both pcDNA3-EBP50 and either pcDNA3GRK2, pcDNA3-GRK5 or pcDNA3-arrestin-3. Fig. 2 shows that 40% of TPβ receptors undergo agonist-induced internalization when the cells are transfected with an empty pcDNA3 vector. Overexpression of GRK2, GRK5, and arrestin-3 in the absence of EBP50 increased TPβ receptor internalization to 50, 54, and 60%, respectively. Similar results were obtained previously for GRK2 and arrestin-3 (5Parent J.L. Labrecque P. Orsini M.J. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8941-8948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). It is the first observation regarding regulation of the TPβ receptor by GRK5, and thus identifies the TPβ receptor as a putative substrate for GRK5. However, Fig. 2 also shows that EBP50 inhibition of TPβ receptor internalization could not be reversed by overexpression of GRK2, GRK5, or arrestin-3. Overexpression of arrestin-2 also failed to reverse the inhibition brought by EBP50 (data not shown). This result suggests that EBP50 probably acts through a mechanism other than the GRK- and arrestin-mediated internalization pathway. As mentioned above, we have recently shown that EBP50 interferes with the TPβ receptor signaling through the Gαq pathway (8Rochdi M.D. Watier V. La Madeleine C. Nakata H. Kozasa T. Parent J.-L. J.

In the genome of the hyperthermophilic Archaeon Thermoproteus tenax a gene was identified with sequence similarity to glucokinases of the so-called ROK family (repressor protein, open reading frame, sugar kinase). The T. tenax enzyme, like the recently described ATP-dependent “glucokinase” from Aeropyrum pernix, shows the typical broad substrate specificity of hexokinases catalyzing not only phosphorylation of glucose but also of other hexoses such as fructose, mannose, or 2-deoxyglucose, and thus both enzymes represent true hexokinases. The T. tenax hexokinase shows strikingly low if at all any regulatory properties and thus fulfills no important control function at the beginning of the variant of the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway in T. tenax. Transcript analyses reveal that the hxk gene of T. tenax is cotranscribed with an upstream located orfX, which codes for an 11-kDa protein of unknown function. Growth-dependent studies and promoter analyses suggest that post-transcriptional RNA processing might be involved in the generation of the monocistronic hxk message, which is observed only under heterotrophic growth conditions. Data base searches revealed T. tenax hexokinase homologs in some archaeal, few eukaryal, and many bacterial genomes. Phylogenetic analyses confirm that the archaeal hexokinase is a member of the so-called ROK family, which, however, should be referred to as ROK group because it represents a group within the bacterial glucokinase fructokinase subfamily II of the hexokinase family. Thus, archaeal hexokinases represent a second major group of glucose-phosphorylating enzymes in Archaea beside the recently described archaeal ADP-dependent glucokinases, which were recognized as members of the ribokinase family. The distribution of the two types of sugar kinases, differing in their cosubstrate as well as substrate specificity, within Archaea is discussed on the basis of physiological constraints of the respective organisms.

Phosphorylation of sugars is of high significance for the carbohydrate metabolism of the cell, particularly for preparing carbohydrates for degradation and transfer reactions but also, as known for several bacteria, as a means of uptake. Among various enzymes engaged in these reactions, especially nucleotide-dependent sugar kinases with various specificities, are important for sugar phosphorylation. In the domain of Archaea, these enzymes play even a more central role for the carbohydrate metabolism than in Bacteria because Archaea in general do not seem to possess a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent transferase system, which delivers the cell with sugar phosphates. To the best of our knowledge the only characterized nucleotide-dependent sugar kinases in Archaea described so far are enzymes that phosphorylate glucose (1Kengen S.W. Tuininga J.E. de Bok F.A.M.

Surprisingly, a striking variety of glucose-phosphorylating enzymes occurs in Archaea: (i) the ADP-dependent glucokinases of Pyrococcus furiosus (1Kengen S.W. Tuininga J.E. de Bok F.A.M.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which is, however, because of its rather broad substrate specificity, in reality a hexokinase (ATP:d-hexose-6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.1). True ATP-dependent glucokinases (ATP:d-glucose 6-phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.1.2), which differ from hexokinases by their high substrate specificity for glucose (as shown for several members of Bacteria and Eukarya) have not been found yet in Archaea. The distribution of glucokinases and hexokinases during evolution is complex and still puzzling. ADP-dependent sugar kinases (glucokinases and phosphofructokinases) are specific for a few Euryarchaea (11Verhees C.H. Tuininga J.E. Kengen S.W. Stams A.J.M. van der Oost J. De Vos W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7145-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16Labes A. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 2001; 176: 329-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and gene homologs encoding proteins of unknown function were identified in some Eukarya (11Verhees C.H. Tuininga J.E. Kengen S.W. Stams A.J.M. van der Oost J. De Vos W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7145-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Whereas highly specific ATP-dependent glucokinases, often together with other specific sugar kinases (e.g. fructokinases, mannokinases), are found in Bacteria and unicellular Eukarya, the nonspecific hexokinases seem to be characteristic of higher Eukarya, which, however, possess several hexokinase isoenzymes (for review, see Ref. 17Cárdenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Ureta T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Most eukaryal ATP-dependent hexokinases represent monomers with subunit molecular masses of 50 (fungi) or 100 kDa (vertebrates, plants). The major allosteric regulator of mammalian hexokinase isoenzymes I, II, and III is glucose 6-phosphate, which inhibits the enzyme. In addition, hexokinase I is activated by citrate and phosphate. Mammalian hexokinase isoenzyme IV is controlled mainly by a regulatory protein. Yeast hexokinases (PI, PII) are active as either monomer or dimer. In the presence of ATP and glucose the formation of the more active dimer is favored, and activation is observed by various metabolites (17Cárdenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Ureta T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 18Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A.M. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 105-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The bacterial ATP-dependent glucokinases are generally homodimers composed of 24–34-kDa subunits, and for Zymomonas mobilis glucokinase an inhibition by glucose 6-phosphate and ADP is described (17Cárdenas M.L. Cornish-Bowden A. Ureta T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1401: 242-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 18Fothergill-Gilmore L.A. Michels P.A.M. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1993; 59: 105-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The characterized archaeal ADP-dependent glucokinases represent homodimeric (P. furiosus, 47-kDa subunit (1Kengen S.W.

Koot D.G.M. Ettema T.J.G. Kijkema C. De Vos W.M. van der Oost J. Biochem. J. 2002; 366: 121-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) is described for the P. furiosus enzyme. Analyses combining sequence, structure, and functional information of 60 different sugar kinases (20 different sugar binding activities) indicate the presence of three distinct sugar kinase families (the hexokinase, ribokinase, and galactokinase families) which exhibit different three-dimensional structures and show no significant similarity (19Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In addition, the authors provide evidence of convergent evolution of similar specificity in different structural families as well as in different branches of the same structural family. Recently, the crystal structure of the ADP-dependent glucokinase from T. litoralis was solved characterizing the enzyme as a member of the ATP-dependent ribokinase family (19Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 20Ito S. Fushinobu S. Yoshioka I. Koga S. Matsuzawa H. Wakagi T. Structure. 2001; 9: 205-214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Despite the striking differences observed between ATP-dependent hexokinases and glucokinases regarding their enzymatic properties and oligomeric state, structural comparisons reveal that they share a common three-dimensional fold and conserved sequence signatures characterizing them as members of the hexokinase family (19Bork P. Sander C. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The hexokinase family is subdivided into three subfamilies: (i) sub-family I, eukaryal hexokinases and glucokinases (yeast); (ii) subfamily II, bacterial glucokinases and fructokinases; and (iii) subfamily III, bacterial sugar kinases with diverse specificities (e.g. fucokinase, ribulokinase, gluconokinase). More recent phylogenetic studies of the two glucokinases from the eukaryal parabasalid Trichomonas vaginalis indicate that they, as well as the enzyme of the diplomonad Giardia intestinalis, are members of the bacterial glucokinase, fructokinase subfamily (subfamily II) and only distantly related to eukaryal hexokinases (21Wu G. Henze K. Müller M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Thus, this former exclusively bacterial subfamily was shown to comprise a mixture of eukaryal as well as bacterial glucokinases (group A), bacterial glucokinases (group B), and fructokinases (group C) (21Wu G. Henze K. Müller M. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 264: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). A close phylogenetic relationship of sugar kinases to proteins with different function was shown by Titgemeyer and co-workers (22Titgemeyer F. Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier Jr., M.H. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2349-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Based on sequence similarity they proposed a novel family of proteins, the “ROK family” (bacterial repressor protein, open reading frames of unknown function, and sugar kinases). So far, several glucokinases of the so-called ROK family have been characterized, and surprisingly the bacterial homologs seem to be involved in carbon catabolite (glucose) repression in addition to their metabolic activity as reported for the enzymes of Streptomyces coelicolor (23Kwakman J.H. Postma P.W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 176: 2694-2698Crossref Google Scholar), Bacillus megaterium (24Späth C. Kraus A. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7603-7605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Bacillus subtilis (25Rosana-Ani I. Skarlatos P. Dahl M.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 171: 89-96Crossref Google Scholar), Staphylococcus xylosus (26Wagner E. Marcandier S. Egeter O. Deutscher J. Götz F. Brückner R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6144-6152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and Corynebacterium glutamicum (27Park S.-Y. Kim H.-K. Yoo S.-K. Oh T.-K. Lee J.-K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 188: 209-215Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses identified also the recently described archaeal hexokinase of A. pernix, which was, however, designated by the authors as glucokinase, and other archaeal homologs as members of the ROK family (4Hansen T. Reichstein B. Schmid R. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, available phylogenetic studies do not address the relationship between the so-called ROK family and the hexokinase family, thus leaving some confusion about the evolutionary relationship between these phylogenetic entities. In Archaea ATP-dependent hexokinase activity has been reported recently for the A. pernix enzyme (glucokinase according to Ref. 4Hansen T. Reichstein B. Schmid R. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and respective activities have been proposed for gene homologs identified in the genomes of Halobacterium sp. strain NRC-1, Thermoplasma acidophilum, T. volcanium, and Pyrobaculum aerophilum (4Hansen T. Reichstein B. Schmid R. Schönheit P. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Verhees C.H. Tuininga J.E. Kengen S.W. Stams A.J.M. van der Oost J. De Vos W. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 7145-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In addition the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose has been shown in crude extracts of Thermoproteus tenax (28Siebers B. Hensel R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 111: 1-8Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and Desulfurococcus amylolyticus (29Selig M. Xavier K.B. Santos H. Schönheit P. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 167: 217-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus the scarce knowledge about archaeal sugar kinases, especially hexokinases and glucokinases, motivates intense studies to get more insight into the evolution of these enzymes, their diversification with respect to substrate specificity, the physiological background of cosubstrate specificity (ATP versus ADP), and their regulatory potential for directing the carbon flux through the various pathways. To address the questions about the dominant phenotype(s) of nucleotide-dependent glucose-phosphorylating enzymes and their metabolic function in Archaea we focused on the ATP-dependent hexokinase of the hyperthermophilic Archaeon T. tenax. T. tenax is a facultative chemoorganotroph (30Zillig W. Stetter K.O. Schäfer W. Janekovic D. Wunderl S. Holz I. Palm P. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Abt 1 Orig. Hyg.

The EMP pathway is characterized by several unique features: (i) a reversible, nonallosteric PPi-dependent phosphofructokinase (5Siebers B. Klenk H.P. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); (ii) two different glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (33Brunner N.A. Brinkmann H. Siebers B. Hensel R. Biochemistry. 1998; 273: 6149-6156Google Scholar, 34Brunner N.A. Siebers B. Hensel R. Extremophiles. 2001; 5: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 35Pohl E. Brunner N. Wilmanns M. Hensel R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19938-19945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar); and (iii) a pyruvate kinase with reduced allosteric potential (36Schramm A. Siebers B. Tjaden B. Brinkmann H. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, deviating from the classical version of the pathway with control points at the beginning (ATP-dependent hexokinase and phosphofructokinase) and at the end of the pathway (pyruvate kinase) regulation was shown to take place at the level of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (33Brunner N.A. Brinkmann H. Siebers B. Hensel R. Biochemistry. 1998; 273: 6149-6156Google Scholar, 34Brunner N.A. Siebers B. Hensel R. Extremophiles. 2001; 5: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although ATP-dependent phosphorylation of glucose was demonstrated in T. tenax (28Siebers B. Hensel R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 111: 1-8Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), so far no information was available about the enzyme, which catalyzes the first committed step of the pathway and represents an important control point in many organisms. Chemicals and Plasmids—All chemicals and enzymes were purchased from Sigma, Merck, or Roche Diagnostics in analytical grade. For heterologous expression of hexokinase the vector pET-11c (Novagen) and for generating antisense mRNA the vector pSPT 19 (Roche Diagnostics) were used. Strains and Growth Conditions—Mass cultures of T. tenax Kra1 (DSM 2078 (30Zillig W. Stetter K.O. Schäfer W. Janekovic D. Wunderl S. Holz I. Palm P. Zentralbl. Bakteriol. Abt 1 Orig. Hyg.

Nature. 1983; 301: 511-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)) were grown under autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions as described previously (34Brunner N.A. Siebers B. Hensel R. Extremophiles. 2001; 5: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strains DH5α (Invitrogen), BL21(DE3), and BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene) for cloning and expression studies were cultured under standard conditions (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) following the instructions of the manufacturer. Enzyme Assay—The hexokinase activity was determined at 50 °C using two different coupled assays. The phosphorylation of glucose was measured by coupling the reaction to the reduction of NADP+ using glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (bakers' yeast, EC 1.1.1.49) as auxiliary enzyme. The standard assay (1 ml total volume) was performed in 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5, 50 °C) in the presence of hexokinase (10–20 μg of protein), 4 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm NADP+, and 3 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 mm glucose. The phosphorylation of different substrates was followed by coupling the formation of ADP to the oxidation of NADH via pyruvate kinase (rabbit muscle (EC 2.7.1.40) and l-lactate dehydrogenase (rabbit muscle, EC 1.1.1.27). The assay (1 ml total volume) was performed in 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5, 50 °C), 2 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 20 mm of the tested sugar, 0.5 mm NADH, 25 units of pyruvate kinase, and 90 units of l-lactate dehydrogenase. The reaction was started by the addition of hexokinase (10–20 μg of protein). Enzymatic activities were measured by monitoring the increase in absorption at 366 nm (ϵnadph 50 °C = 3.36 mm–1 cm–1, ϵnadph 50 °C = 3.43 mm–1 cm–1). The substrate specificity for different sugars was examined following the formation of ADP and replacing glucose by other substrates such as fructose or mannose. The nucleotide and cation specificity, as well as effector studies, were determined via the standard enzyme assay with glucose as substrate. Effector studies were performed in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 and half-saturating concentrations of glucose (60 μm) and ATP (300 μm). The different substances were added at a concentration of 0.1, 1, 5, or 10 mm. To test the metal ion requirement, 2.5 mm EDTA or metal ions (Mg2+ and Mn2+) were added to the mixture. The protein concentration was determined according to the method of Bradford (38Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay with bovine standard albumin as standard. Cloning of the hxk Gene and Expression in E. coli—In the course of the ongoing T. tenax genome sequencing project an open reading frame with significant sequence similarity to glucokinases was identified (accession number AJ510140, EMBL nucleotide sequence data base). For expression the hxk gene was cloned into pET-11c using two new restriction sites (NdeI and BamHI) introduced by PCR mutagenesis with the following primer set: GK-2-NdeI-f (TCCAGAGTCAGCATATGATCTTGGCCATCG, sense) and GK-2-BamHI-rev (AGCGGTCTGTTGGCGGATCCAAACGCTCAG, antisense). The mutations are shown in boldface, and the resulting NdeI and BamHI restriction sites are underlined. PCR mutagenesis was performed using Pwo polymerase and genomic T. tenax DNA as template. The sequence of the expression clones was controlled by sequencing. Expression of the T. tenax enzyme in E. coli BL21(DE3) and BL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL was performed following the instructions of the manufacturer (Stratagene). Purification of the Recombinant Hexokinase—Recombinant E. coli cells (5 g, wet weight) were suspended in 15 ml of 100 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5) containing 7.5 mm dithiothreitol (buffer A) and passed three times through a French pressure cell at 150 MPa. Cell debris and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation (85,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the resulting crude extract was diluted 1:1 with buffer A, heat-precipitated (90 °C, 30 min), centrifuged again (20,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C), and dialyzed overnight against 50 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.5), 7.5 mm dithiothreitol (2-liter volume, 4 °C). The dialyzed fraction was applied to a Q-Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Biosciences) column (volume 30 ml, C16/20) equilibrated in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Hexokinase activity was detected only in flow-through fractions, and those containing the homogeneous enzyme solution were pooled. Gel filtration experiments were performed as described previously (5Siebers B. Klenk H.P. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2137-2143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Northern Blot Analyses of the hxk Transcript—Digoxigenin-labeled antisense mRNA of hexokinase was obtained by cloning a part of the hxk gene (278 bp) into pSPT19 (Roche Diagnostics) by PCR mutagenesis using the primer set GK-pSPT19-EcoRI-f (TGGCCAACGAATTCGTTGCCGCCGC, sense) and GK-pSPT19-BamHI-rev (GGCGCCCTGGATCCCAACCTAGCGG, antisense). The introduced EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites are underlined and the mutations are shown in boldface. In vitro transcription from the T7 promoter of pSPT19 was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Preparation of total RNA from auto- and heterotrophically grown T. tenax cells and Northern blot analyses were performed as described previously (36Schramm A. Siebers B. Tjaden B. Brinkmann H. Hensel R. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2001-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Sequence Retrieval and Phylogenetic Analyses—Protein sequences were extracted from GenBank and the TIGR microbial data base using BLAST, first aligned with ClustalX (39Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar), and then manually refined using the MUST program package (40Philippe H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5264-5272Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Regions of uncertain alignment and partial sequences were omitted from the analyses leaving a total of 53 sequences and 212 amino acid positions. The phylogenetic tree shown in Fig. 4 corresponds to the consensus tree obtained by the MrBayes analysis, the option majority rule consensus tree was used (41Huelsenbeck J.P. Ronquist F. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 754-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (19396) Google Scholar). MrBayes version 2.01 was used for the Baysian inference with 100,000 generations using the JTT model and gamma distributed rates, the trees were sampled every 10 generations (41Huelsenbeck J.P. Ronquist F. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 754-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (19396) Google Scholar). The number of generations needed until convergence around a stable likelihood value was in the range of 5–10%. The posterior probabilities given in the MrBayes consensus tree are indicated as percent values in the phylogenetic tree. A maximum likelihood based estimate of the gamma parameter as well as of the statistical support for internal nodes (quartet puzzling support values) was performed using the program TREE-PUZZLE v.5 (42Strimmer K. van Haeseler A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1996; 13: 964-969Crossref Scopus (2276) Google Scholar). Distance analyses including 1000 bootstrap replicates were performed with the MEGA2 package using gamma correction and the Minimal evolution approach (43Kumar S. Tamura K. Jakobsen I.B. Nei M. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (4557) Google Scholar). A Maximum parsimony bootstrap analysis was performed using PAUP* with 1000 bootstrap replicates and 10 times random addition (44Swofford D.L.

https://openalex.org/W1974668166,"We have previously reported that two highly conserved amino acids in the C-terminal domain of rat insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-5, Gly203 and Gln209, are involved in binding to insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. Here we report that mutagenesis of both amino acids simultaneously (C-Term mutant) results in a cumulative effect and an even greater reduction in IGF-I binding: 30-fold measured by solution phase IGF binding assay and 10-fold by biosensor analysis. We compared these reductions in ligand binding to the effects of specific mutations of five amino acids in the N-terminal domain (N-Term mutant), which had previously been shown by others to cause a very large reduction in IGF-I binding (1Imai Y.

Our results confirm this as the major IGF-binding site. To prove that the mutations in either N- or C-Term were specific for IGF-I binding, we carried out CD spectroscopy and showed that these alterations did not lead to gross conformational changes in protein structure for either mutant. Combining these mutations in both domains (N+C-Term mutant) has a cumulative effect and leads to a 126-fold reduction in IGF-I binding as measured by biosensor. Furthermore, the equivalent mutations in the C terminus of rat IGFBP-2 (C-Term 2) also results in a significant reduction in IGF-I binding, suggesting that the highly conserved Gly and Gln residues have a conserved IGF-I binding function in all six IGFBPs. Finally, although these residues lie within a major heparin-binding site in IGFBP-5 and -3, we also show that the mutations in C-Term have no effect on heparin binding.

In turn, IGFs are regulated by a family of six IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) that form high affinity complexes with both IGF-I and IGF-II (reviewed in Ref. 2Hwa V. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 761-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). Because the affinity constants of the IGFBPs are between 2- and 50-fold greater for binding IGFs than that of the IGF type 1 receptor, it is thought that the IGFBPs are able to regulate the bioavailability of IGFs in different biological fluids. IGFBPs are proteins of 216–289 residues, and all share a common protein structure that can be conceptually divided up into three domains, where a domain may be defined as a region of a protein that can fold into a tertiary structure independent of neighboring sequences (2Hwa V. Oh Y. Rosenfeld R.G. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 761-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). There is a particularly high degree of conservation in the N- and C-terminal domains, which contain 12 and 6 cysteine residues, respectively, in IGFBPs 1–6 of all species sequenced so far. A nonconserved region separating the N- and C-terminal domains contains most of the sites for proteolysis and post-translational modifications. Both the N- and C-terminal cysteine-rich domains of IGFBPs are believed to participate in IGF binding. This is supported by work where fragments from the N-terminal cysteine-rich domains of IGFBP-1 (3Huhtala M.L. Koistinen R. Palomaki P. Partanen P. Bohn H. Seppala M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Roghani M. Hossenlopp P. Hardouin S. Gourmelen M. Acta Endocrinol. 1991; 124: 41-47PubMed Google Scholar) were generated and shown to possess residual IGF binding activity. More recently, several groups have reported biosensor analysis of N- and C-terminal fragments of bovine IGFBP-2 and human IGFBP-3 (11Carrick F.E. Forbes B.E. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27120-27128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 12Galanis M. Firth S.M. Bond J. Nathanielsz A. Kortt A.A. Hudson P.J. Baxter R.C. J.

Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and all of these studies indicated that there were major IGF-binding sites in both the N- and C-terminal domains. Work from several laboratories has already identified the specific amino acids in the N-terminal domain of the IGFBP molecule that contribute to IGF binding. Initially it was observed that Tyr60 was protected against iodination upon binding of bovine IGFBP-2 to IGF-II (14Hobba G.D. Forbes B.E. Parkinson E.J. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30529-30536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and subsequently, the same group demonstrated that substitution of this amino acid leads to reduced affinities for IGF-I and -II (15Hobba G.D. Lothgren A. Holmberg E. Forbes B.E. Francis G.L. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19691-19698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, NMR was carried out on a bacterially expressed N-terminal fragment of IGFBP-5 (residues 40–92), and this clearly demonstrated that a major IGF-binding domain comprises Val49, Tyr50 (equivalent to Tyr60 in IGFBP-2), Pro62, and Lys68–Leu75, where the conserved Leu and Val residues localize in a hydrophobic patch on the surface of the IGFBP-5 protein (7Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6558-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Subsequently, it was shown that substituting specific hydrophobic residues in this region of IGFBP-5 resulted in an ∼1000-fold reduction in affinity for IGF-I, as measured by solution phase ligand binding assays (1Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, there remains a possibility that the effects of these mutations are nonspecific because they may have caused a gross alteration in protein structure, despite the fact that they did not involve the highly conserved cysteine residues. The NMR study described above also found that the N-terminal fragments of IGFBP-5 had a 10–200-fold lower affinity for IGFs than the full-length protein (7Kalus W. Zweckstetter M. Renner C. Sanchez Y. Georgescu J. Grol M. Demuth D. Schumacher R. Dony C. Lang K. Holak T.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6558-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), which agrees well with the reported reduced affinities of other C-terminally truncated fragments of IGFBP-3 (16Clemmons D.R. IGF Mol. Repod. Dev. 1993; 35: 368-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) and IGFBP-5 (6Andress D.L. Loop S.M. Zapf J. Kiefer M.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This indicated that other residues at the C terminus of the IGFBP proteins must be required in the additional stabilization of IGF complex formation that leads to high affinity binding. Less attention has focused on identifying the C-terminal residues in IGFBPs that are involved in IGF interaction. However, a strong clue as to where some or all of these important residues may lie came from a deletion analysis of the C terminus of bovine IGFBP-2, which identified a critical region between amino acids 222 and 236 of IGFBP-2 involved in binding IGFs (17Forbes B.E. Turner D. Hodge S.J. McNeil K.A. Forsberg G. Wallace J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4647-4652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This region of bovine IGFBP-2 corresponds to amino acid sequences in both IGFBP-5 and -3, which are rich in basic residues (201–218 in IGFBP-5). Although several of these basic amino acids have been shown to play a critical role in IGFBP-5 binding to both heparin and the extracellular matrix (18Arai T. Clarke J. Parker A. Busby Jr., W. Nam T. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6099-6106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19Parker A. Badley-Clarke J. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13523-13529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Song H. Shand J.H. Beattie J. Flint D.J. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 26: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), it has also been demonstrated that extensive mutagenesis of the basic amino acids alone had no effect on IGF-I binding (21Parker A. Rees C. Clarke J. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 22Song H. Beattie J. Campbell I.W. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, alignment of amino acid sequences for all six binding proteins from several species reveals that there are two completely conserved nonbasic amino acids (Gly203 and Gln209 in rat IGFBP-5) within this region (Fig. 1), and this conservation suggests an important function for these amino acids. We have shown previously that mutation of either Gly203 or Gln209 results in a significant reduction in affinity for binding to IGF-I (7- and 6-fold, respectively) but has no effect on heparin binding (22Song H. Beattie J. Campbell I.W. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Bramani S. Song H. Beattie J. Tonner E. Flint D.J. Allan G.J J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This clearly demonstrates that there is overlap of IGF and heparin-binding sites in the C-terminal domain of IGFBP-5. In the present study, we investigate whether there is a cumulative effect on the ability of IGFBP-5 to bind to IGF-I (or heparin) when both Gly203 and Gln209 are mutated simultaneously (G203A/Q209A; C-Term), and we also extend these mutations to the corresponding residues in IGFBP-2 (G211A/Q217A; C-Term 2) to determine whether this reflects a conserved IGF-binding site in IGFBPs. In addition, to ascertain the relative contribution of the N- and C-terminal domains of IGFBP-5 in binding IGF-I, we have recreated the mutations described by Imai et al. (1Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) in the N terminus (K68N/P69Q/L70Q/L73Q/L74Q; N-Term) and compared IGF-I binding of C-Term, N-Term, and a combined mutant, N+C-Term, by ligand blotting, solution phase IGF binding assays, and biosensor real time analysis of binding kinetics. Furthermore, because it was not previously reported whether the mutations in the IGFBP-5 C terminus (22Song H. Beattie J. Campbell I.W. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 23Bramani S. Song H. Beattie J. Tonner E. Flint D.J. Allan G.J J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or N terminus (1Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) led to a conformational change in the protein structure, we have carried out CD analysis on both C-Term and N-Term to establish whether these mutations are specific for IGF binding. The implications of these findings for IGFBP-5 interaction with IGFs and heparin are discussed. The full-length cDNAs for rat IGFBP-5 and -2 in pGEM®-7zf (Promega, Madison, WI), containing both initiator and signal peptide, was kindly provided by Dr. S. Guenette (John Wayne Cancer Institute, Los Angeles, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChangeTM system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. The rat and mouse protein sequence of IGFBP-5 only differs by a single amino acid at position 188 (Asp and Glu, respectively). Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to convert wt rat to wt mouse sequences (D188E) using the oligonucleotides: 5′-GAC AGG AAT CTG AAC AAG GCC CCT GCC-3′ and 5′-GGC AGG GGC CTT GTT CAG ATT CCT GTC-3′. The oligonucleotide used to make Q209A was described previously (21Parker A. Rees C. Clarke J. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2383-2392Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Q209A was used as a template to make C-Term (G203A/Q209A) using the oligonucleotides 5′-AAC TGT GAC CGC AAA GCT TTC TAC AAG AGA AAG-3′ and 5′-CTT TCT CTT GTA GAA AGC TTT GCG GTC ACA GTT-3′. N-Term (K68N/P69Q/L70Q/L73Q/L74Q) was made using the oligonucleotides 5′-GGA TGA GGA GAA CCA GCA GCA CGC CCA GCA GCA CGG CCG CGG-3′ and 5′-CCG CGG CCG TGC TGC TGG GCG TGC TGC TGG TTC TCC TCA TCC-3′. The N+C-Term composite mutant was made by using the uniqueSacII restriction endonuclease site in the IGFBP-5 cDNA sequence to cut and ligate N-Term and C-Term sequences together. The wt rat IGFBP-2 cDNA was mutated to make C-Term 2 (G211A/Q217A) using the oligonucleotides 5′-AAC TGT GAC AAG CAT GCT CTG TAC AAC CTC AAA GCT-3′ and 5′-CAG AGA CAT CTT GCA AGC TTT GAG GTT GTA CAG AGC-3′. Our previously reported “heparin minus” (Hep−) mutant is defective in its ability to bind to heparin (22Song H. Beattie J. Campbell I.W. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All of the oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG BioTech (Milton Keynes, UK). Following site-directed mutagenesis, automated DNA sequencing (MWG BioTech) was carried out on all clones to confirm that the correct mutations had been made. Expression of recombinant IGFBP-5 proteins was carried out using conditions identical to those described previously (24Allan G.J. Tonner E. Barber M.C. Travers M.T. Shand J.H. Vernon R.G. Kelly P.A. Binart N. Flint D.J. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4310-4319Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, mouse wt IGFBP-5 and the various IGFBP-5 mutants were cloned without the signal peptide-encoding sequence into the pGEX 6P-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences), so that the proteins would have an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. The proteins were expressed in the Origami B (DE3) pLysS strain ofEscherichia coli (Novagen, Madison, WI), and following cell lysis the GST-IGFBP-5 fusion proteins were extracted from the soluble fraction only and subsequently subjected to two rounds of purification. The cell lysates were loaded onto glutathione-Sepharose columns (Amersham Biosciences), and the purified IGFBP proteins were then eluted following removal of the GST tag with PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences). Subsequently, the untagged IGFBP proteins were purified on IGF-I affinity columns and quantified as described previously (20Song H. Shand J.H. Beattie J. Flint D.J. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 26: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Commercial mouse IGFBP-5 expressed in the mouse myeloma cell line NSO was purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Rat wt IGFBP-2 and C-Term 2 were expressed untagged using the pET-15b vector (Novagen) in Origami B cells, using the same methodology as that used for the IGFBP-5 proteins, except the cell lysate supernatant was used for subsequent analyses. To compare the secondary structures of wt IGFBP-5, C-Term, and N-Term proteins, CD spectropolarimetry data were recorded using a JASCO J-600 spectropolarimeter in cells with path lengths of 0.02 cm (far-UV) using protein concentrations of 0.5 mg/ml for both wild type and mutant IGFBP-5 samples (time constant, 2 s; scan speed, 10 nm/min). The secondary structure contents of wild type, C-Term, and N-Term mutants were estimated using the CONTIN procedure of Provencher and Glöckner (25Provencher S.W. Glöckner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1890) Google Scholar) and the SELCON procedure of Sreerama and Woody (26Sreerema N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2538) Google Scholar). Secondary structure estimates were obtained using data values down to 190 nm in both the wild type and N-Term proteins. In the case of the C-term mutant, the signal to noise ratio was not favorable below 197 nm, thus precluding the use of data below this wavelength. Fluorescence spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer LS50B fluorimeter in 1-cm-path length cells using protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml for both wild type and mutant samples; (excitation, 290 nm; slits of 5-nm band pass). The proteins were electrophoresed on 12% acrylamide SDS-PAGE gels under nonreducing conditions and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The ligand blots were performed according to the method described previously (27Hossenlopp P. Seurin D. Segovia-Quinson B. Hardouin S. Binoux M. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 138-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (1199) Google Scholar), using IGF-I (GroPep Limited, Adelaide, Australia) radiolabeled to a specific activity of ∼100 μCi/μg. Western blots with either an “in-house” sheep anti-rat IGFBP-5 antiserum or a commercial rabbit anti-bovine IGFBP-2 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) were performed as described previously (23Bramani S. Song H. Beattie J. Tonner E. Flint D.J. Allan G.J J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 23: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and were used to monitor protein loading during ligand and heparin blotting experiments. The method used for heparin ligand blotting was also described previously (22Song H. Beattie J. Campbell I.W. Allan G.J. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 24: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Binding affinities for IGF-I were assayed in solution by the method described previously by Conover et al. (28Conover C.A. Lim F. Powell D. Rosenfeld R.G. Hintz R.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 852-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The assays were performed using the PreScission protease eluate fractions obtained after expression of wt IGFBP-5 and the C-Term mutant and the supernatant bacterial lysates containing recombinant wt IGFBP-2 and the C-Term 2 mutant. The optimal amount of each protein preparation was calculated following initial saturation binding assays containing 25,000–30,000 dpm (15–18 fmol) [125I]IGF-I. The affinities were then assessed by Scatchard analysis of binding curves obtained in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled IGF-I. Only the affinities for the wt IGFBP-5 and C-Term are reported because binding to the N-Term and N+C-Term mutants was too low to be measured by this method. Biosensor studies were performed using the Biacore 3000 instrument. Human IGF-I (10 μg/ml in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5) was immobilized into flow cell 2 of three separate CM5 biosensor chips at ligand densities of 50, 100, and 200 response units. To provide a control binding surface, insulin was immobilized in flow cell 1 of the three biosensor chips at the same level of ligand density. Both IGF-I and insulin were immobilized using amine-coupling chemistry according to protocols provided by the manufacturer. For kinetic studies, purified proteins were injected at five different concentrations and at a flow rate of 30 μl/min in 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% surfactant P20. All of the experiments were performed at ambient temperature. The protein concentrations were as follows: commercial mouse IGFBP-5 and wt mouse IGFBP-5 (in-house): 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, and 25 nm; C-Term, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, and 50 nm; and N-Term and N+C-Term, 25, 50, 100, 200, and 400 nm. The association and dissociation phases of the binding curves were 3 and 15 min, respectively, for the commercial protein and 5 and 15 min, respectively, for all others. Following binding the surface of the chip was regenerated by two 30-s pulses of 50 mm NaOH, 1 m NaCl. Protein samples and a buffer blank were injected in duplicate and in random order using each of the three biosensor chips. The data were analyzed assuming a 1:1 stoichiometry of interaction between IGF-I and IGFBP-5 using the Langmuir model provided in the BiaEvaluation 3.1 software and employing the global data analysis option. N-terminal sequence analysis of the recombinant wt IGFBP-5 protein showed the expected sequence (GPLGSLGSFVHCEPCDDEK) derived from pGEX 6P-1 and the mature IGFBP-5 sequence minus signal peptide, indicating that there had been proper processing by PreScission protease. 2I. Davidson, personal communication. It can be seen from the CD results (Fig.2A) that despite the apparently significant differences in amplitude, the secondary structure estimates (given in Table I) are broadly similar, exhibiting a strong negative band with a minimum close to 200 nm in each case. Secondary structure estimates of these spectra indicate a low percentage of α-helix and a greater proportion of β-sheet and β-turns for each protein. The fluorescence emission spectra (Fig. 2B) show that wt IGFBP-5, C-Term, and N-Term have very similar emission maxima (∼345 nm) with considerable differences in intensity. In view of the fact that intensity depends on the relative magnitudes of the rates of various processes that lead to the decay of the excited state, the emission maximum is generally regarded as a more reliable indicator of the polarity of the Trp environments in a protein (29Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 672-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). On this basis, the solvent exposure of the Trp side chains is very similar in the three proteins, indicating that little or no overall change in tertiary structure has occurred.Table ISecondary structural estimations of wild type, C-Term, and N-Term proteinsCONTINα-Helixβ-Sheetβ-TurnOtherWild type8452125C-Term5413717N-Term562330SELCONα-HelixAntiparallel β-SheetParallel β-SheetTurnsOtherWild type7.429.40.728.334.5C-Term11.430.00.225.332.2N-Term11.126.70.228.233.7 Open table in a new tab Following on from this, we compared [125I]IGF-I binding of the mutant IGFBP-5 proteins, N-Term, C-Term, and N+C-Term, to that of the wt protein using ligand blotting (Fig.3, upper panel). The same filter was also subject to Western analysis with the appropriate antiserum to verify equivalent protein loading (Fig. 3, lower panel). Although all three mutant proteins displayed reduced IGF-I binding, we note that relative to wt IGFBP-5, the greatest effect on IGF-I binding was with N-Term and N+C-Term, which display no apparent binding on ligand blots (Fig. 3). We also examined the affinity of these mutant proteins in a solution phase analysis of the IGF-I-IGFBP interaction (Fig.4). Scatchard analysis could only be derived from binding curves for wt IGFBP-5 and C-Term (KD values of 0.13 and 3.54 nm, respectively), which indicated that C-Term had a 30-fold lower affinity than the wt protein for binding IGF-I. We also included a commercial mouse wt IGFBP-5 protein from R & D Systems to compare IGF-I binding of wt IGFBP-5 expressed in either mammalian cells or bacteria. Our data demonstrate that the commercial and in-house wt IGFBP-5 proteins have very similar affinities or KD values for binding to IGF-I, with 0.102 and 0.13 nm, respectively. However, in support of our ligand blotting data, binding of IGF-I to the N-Term and N+C-Term mutants was too low to be able to derive Scatchard data, although Imai et al. (1Imai Y. Moralez A. Andag U. Clarke J.B. Busby Jr., W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) were able to measure an ∼1000-fold reduction with the equivalent N-Term mutations. This apparent discrepancy could possibly be the result of differences in the solution phase assay techniques employed by the two groups. Nevertheless, both agree that amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal domain of IGFBP-5 result in very large reductions in IGF-I binding. As a further confirmation of the IGF binding properties of these IGFBP-5 mutant proteins, we undertook a biosensor analysis of binding kinetics of the proteins to IGF-I immobilized to a biosensor surface (Fig. 5). In agreement with the solution phase data above, the commercial and in-house wt IGFBP-5 proteins had almost exactly the same KD values, with 0.22 and 0.21 nm, respectively. However, the KDvalues for N-Term, C-Term, and N+C-Term were 12.5, 2.1, and 25.9 nm, respectively. For N-Term and C-Term this demonstrates 60- and 10-fold reductions in affinity for binding IGF-I compared with the wt protein and a cumulative effect of the N+C-Term mutant, which displays a 126-fold reduction in binding. This type of analysis also gives details of on and off rate kinetic constants, from which equilibrium constants can be derived (TableII). Closer inspection of the biosensor data revealed that although the N- and C-Term mutants displayed similar changes to their Koff or rate of dissociation values, the overall larger reduction in IGF-I affinity observed for N-Term was primarily due to a substantially slowerKon or rate of association compared with C-Term. Finally, the highest reduction in IGF-I affinity observed for the N+C-Term mutant was largely the result of a cumulative effect on itsKoff, which was approximately twice as fast as that of either N- or C-Term. We also note that the absoluteKD values for wt IGFBP-5 and C-Term varied by up to 2-fold between biosensor and solution phase assays and that C-Term displayed a greater reduction in binding relative to the wt protein in the latter system (30-fold versus 10-fold).Table IIIGF binding affinitiesProteinKonKoffKo-Fold decrease×105×10−3nmwt37.5 ± 23.10.72 ± 0.540.206 ± 0.089C-Term14.5 ± 3.22.47 ± 1.672.08 ± 1.8710N-Term2.18 ± 0.352.70 ± 0.412.45 ± 0.1560N + C-Term2.21 ± 0.655.14 ± 0.2625.9 ± 8.8126BiaCore analysis of kinetic constants for wt IGFBP-5, C-Term, N-Term, and N + C-Term binding to immobilized IGF-I.KD is derived asKoff/Kon.

Because Gly203 and Gln209 lie within the heparin-binding site between amino acids 201 and 218 in the C-terminal domain of IGFBP-5, experiments were also carried out to investigate the heparin binding properties of the C-Term mutant.

DNA is wrapped tightly around histone proteins in nucleosomes that are arranged in a chromatin higher order structure (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar, 2Davey C.A. Sargent D.F. Luger K. Maeder A.W. Richmond T.J. J. Mol.

The organization of DNA in chromatin is thought to act as a barrier to transcription causing gene repression. Two alterations of chromatin have been implicated in transcription regulation: remodeling by ATP-dependent factors such as SWI/SNF, RSC, NRD, or NURF (4Tsukiyama T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 422-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar); and post-translational modification of the histone N-terminal tails including phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation (5Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7709) Google Scholar). Among these, the acetylation modification has been recognized as a major contributor to transcription regulation (6Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6679) Google Scholar) and is maintained by the dynamic interplay of histone acetylase and deacetylase (HDAC)1 enzyme antagonists. Acetylation of histone tails by histone acetylases is thought to create a chromatin structure accessible to the transcription machinery (1Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6991) Google Scholar, 7Eberharter A. Becker P.B. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 224-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), and conversely, hypoacetylated chromatin, the product of HDACs, is often associated with transcriptionally silent DNA (8Grunstein M. Nature. 1997; 389: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Histone deacetylases have attracted considerable attention recently, due to findings that compounds blocking these enzymes can reactivate gene expression (9Wade P.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), inhibit growth and survival of tumor cells (10Johnstone R.W. Nat. Rev.

To date, 17 HDAC isoforms were described in humans, which are divided into classes based on sequence homology to yeast enzymes and association with DNA-binding proteins. Class I HDACs 1–3 and 8 are similar to Rpd3 from yeast (12Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9 contain a conserved N-terminal region that shows similarity to a co-repressor protein first isolated from Xenopus laevis named MITR (MEF2 interactingtranscription repressor, see Ref. 24Sparrow D.B.

MEF2 transcription factors have an essential role in the myogenesis and morphogenesis of cardiac and skeletal muscle cells (29McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). MEF2 factors specifically recognize the control regions of the majority of muscle-specific genes, as well as nerve-specific and other unrelated genes (30Mao Z. Bonni A. Xia F. Nadal-Vicens M. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1999; 286: 785-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 31Youn H.D. Sun L. Prywes R. Liu J.O. Science. 1999; 286: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, the MEF2 family comprises the members MEF2a–d, each having several splicing variants. Together, the factors show more than 85% identity in an 86-amino acid core that is sufficient for specific DNA binding and dimerization (32Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). MEF2 proteins belong to the MADS box superfamily of transcription factors characterized by strong sequence homology in a 58-amino acid DNA binding domain. This MADS domain is N-terminal in MEF2 proteins and immediately followed by a conserved 28-amino acid MEF domain that determines homo- and heterodimerization products of MEF2 family members and excludes heterodimerization with other MADS box transcription factors (33Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 34Molkentin J.D. Black B.L. Martin J.F. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2627-2636Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Recently, this laboratory reported the crystal structure of MEF2a core encompassing amino acids 2–78 bound to cognate DNA at 1.5 Å resolution (35Santelli E. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The structure revealed the DNA binding interactions and showed that the MEF domain adopts a configuration distinct from the respective regions in other MADS box proteins, thus explaining its dimerization properties. An NMR study of a similar MEF2a protein-DNA complex corroborated the findings (36Huang K. Louis J.M. Donaldson L. Lim F.-L. Sharrocks A.D. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2615-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Considerable evidence supports a role of MEF2 proteins as integrators of calcium signaling (29McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) mediated by calcium/ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK), and CaMK regulation of MEF2 activity appears to play a crucial role in processes leading to myocardial hypertrophy (26Lu J.

Cell. 2002; 110: 479-488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). The responsiveness to CaMK mediated activation mapped to the MADS/MEF domains of MEF2a, which were unphosphorylated, however (36Huang K. Louis J.M. Donaldson L. Lim F.-L. Sharrocks A.D. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2615-2628Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Instead, the targets of CaMK activity were HDAC4 and HDAC5. Phosphorylation of these proteins leads to the disruption of the MEF2a-HDAC complexes and resulted in activation of MEF2-controlled genes (26Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated HDAC was found to bind the chaperone protein 14-3-3, resulting in translocation of phospho-HDAC into the cytosol (39Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7835-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar, 40Wang A.H. Kruhlak M.J. Wu J. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Posner B.I. Bazett-Jones D.P. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell.

Consistent with a role in regulation of MEF2, class II HDACs are expressed predominantly in tissues where MEF2 levels are highest (heart, skeletal muscle, and brain). CaMK function is triggered by calmodulin, which in turn is activated by increased Ca2+ levels in the cell, thus linking MEF2 function to Ca2+ signaling (29McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 40-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Recently, however, a more direct role of Ca2+/calmodulin in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of MEF2-controlled gene expression was suggested based on the observation that HDAC4 protein is retained on calmodulin-conjugated resin in the presence of Ca2+ and that a putative calmodulin-binding motif exists in the N-terminal region of HDAC4 (42Youn H.-D. Grozinger C.M. Liu J.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22563-22567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that class II enzyme HDAC5 directly associates with calmodulin in a Ca2+-dependent manner. By using a combination of biochemical and biophysical techniques, we define a stable core of HDAC5 that binds to MEF2a and calmodulin with high affinity. The dissociation constants of the interaction with MEF2a on the one hand and calmodulin on the other hand are determined by real time binding experiments. Experimental support for overlapping MEF2a and calmodulin-binding sites in HDAC5 is provided. By using purified proteins, we show for the first time that direct interaction of Ca2+/calmodulin inhibits HDAC5 binding to MEF2a. Human HDAC5 repressor core polypeptides were expressed as fusion proteins containing a His6 tag at the C terminus. Genes encoding for amino acids 140–308 (RprcL) and 140–227 (RprcS), respectively, of human HDAC5 (17Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) with a starting methionine added were cloned into a pET28a plasmid (Novagen) using the NcoI andHindIII sites and expressed in Escherichia coliBL21(DE3). Pellets were resuspended in ice-cold Buffer T (25 mm BisTris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mmimidazole, pH 7.0) and passed through a cell cracker. Cleared lysate was loaded on Talon cobalt resin (Clontech) and washed with Buffer T containing 600 mm NaCl. Bound protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient to 200 mm, concentrated into Buffer P (25 mm BisTris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 6.0), and applied to a Poros HS column (Perseptive Biosystems). RprcL as well as RprcS eluted in a single peak around 400 mm NaCl. During purification of RprcL, a major proteolytic breakdown product (“SmFr,” see “Results”) was eluted at 300 mm NaCl and could be pooled separately. Repressor core proteins were finally passed through a Superdex S200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) and concentrated up to 14 mg/ml for storage. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorption at 280 nm assuming an extinction coefficient of ε280 = 8250 m−1cm−1 (RprcL) and ε280 = 5690m−1 cm−1 (RprcS), respectively (43Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (5073) Google Scholar). The mutant protein RprcS(L187G) was generated from the RprcS gene by site-directed mutagenesis (QuickChange, Stratagene) with primers 5′GCACTGAGGTAAAGCTGAGGGGCCAGGAATTCC3′ and 5′GGAATTCCTGGCCCCTCAGCTTTACCTCAGTGC3′. RprcS(L187G) protein was expressed and purified exactly as described for RprcS wild type. The gene encoding for full-length calmodulin (CaM) from X. laevis (44Chien Y.H. Dawid I.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 507-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was excised from the construct pTSNco12CaM (45Shatzman A.R. Rosenberg M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 478: 233-248Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and ligated into NcoI/HindIII-digested pET28a plasmid to yield pET28CaM. CaM was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells, purified as published (45Shatzman A.R. Rosenberg M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1987; 478: 233-248Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), lyophilized, and stored as a powder. Prior to use, CaM was dissolved in water at concentrations up to 30 mg/ml. Mass spectrometric analysis and Edman degradation of the purified protein revealed that the N-terminal methionine had been quantitatively removed. The resulting protein encompassing amino acids alanine 2 to lysine 149 is termed full-length CaM throughout the text. For biotinylation, purified CaM protein was incubated with NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) following a procedure described by Billingsleyet al. (46Billingsley M.L. Pennypacker K.R. Hoover C.G. Brigati D.J. Kincaid R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 82: 7585-7589Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar) modified such that an equimolar ratio of NHS-LC-biotin to protein was chosen rather than an excess of 14 to 1 (46Billingsley M.L.

Thus, on average the attachment of one biotin to each CaM molecule was achieved as verified by MALDI analysis. MEF2a core protein (amino acids 2–86 of full-length MEF2a) encompassing the MADS box and the MEF domain was expressed and purified following published procedures (35Santelli E. Richmond T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 437-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). This core protein is termed MEF2a throughout the text. All expressed proteins (RprcL, RprcS, RprcS(L187G), CaM, and MEF2a) were purified to homogeneity as verified by Coomassie staining, N-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrometric analysis. CD spectra were recorded at 20 °C using a J710 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller and interfaced to a personal computer. Stock solutions of protein samples were prepared in a 25 mm BisTris buffer, pH 6.0, containing 100 mmKF. Protein solutions of 10 μm or less were used to obtain the data. The CD spectra were measured at a bandwidth of 2 nm, with a step size of 0.5 nm with 4 s averaging time per point in a 0.1-cm cuvette. Spectra were signal averaged by adding three scans, base-line corrected, and smoothed using the software provided by Jasco. Protease digestion of HDAC5 repressor core proteins was performed by treating 1 mg/ml solution of protein with trypsin from bovine pancreas (Roche Applied Science) in Proteolysis Buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, pH 8.0) at a fixed protein to protease mass ratio at 24 °C in a 1-ml reaction volume. At serial time points, 55-μl aliquots were taken from the reaction. A fraction (5 μl) of these aliquots was immediately flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored for mass spectrometric analysis. The remaining 50 μl were transferred into prepared tubes containing reducing protein gel loading dye and flash-frozen for SDS-PAGE analysis. Reactions were repeated several times showing the reproducibility of the proteolytic fragmentation pattern by using this sample freezing procedure. Digests of calmodulin or purified calmodulin-repressor core complex, respectively, were performed in a similar fashion, with the exception that CaCl2 was added to the reaction buffer to a final concentration of 2 mm. Proteolytic fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE (18%) and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Protein gels were blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and prominent bands were subjected to N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation. Mass spectrometry of the proteolytic mixtures was performed using a Vestec Voyager Biospectrometry Workstation (Perspective Biosystems). Sinapinic acid in 67% acetonitrile, 0.03% trifluoroacetic acid was used as a matrix. Data were analyzed with the Data Explorer software package 4.0 (Applied Biosystems). In ambiguous cases, where Edman degradation yielded several overlapping sequences for the N termini, further purification of the proteolytic fragments was performed by reversed phase chromatography on a Nucleosil 300-5 C8 column (Macherey-Nagel) applying a trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile gradient. Fractions containing enriched peptide species were lyophilized, resuspended in 30% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and used directly for N-terminal sequencing and MALDI analysis. Tryptic fragments were assigned according to their experimental average masses and taking into account the N-terminal sequences utilizing the FindPept tool of the Expasy package (www.expasy.ch). Band intensities of full-length calmodulin on SDS-PAGE gels displaying tryptic fragments of CaM or CaM-RprcS complex, respectively, were recorded on an Alpha Imager 2200 Documentation and Analysis System device (Alpha Innotech Corp.), using the spot densitometry module of software package Imager 2200 version 5.1, and normalized to the respective band intensity of the undigested sample. A 60-mer DNA oligonucleotide duplex matching the muscle creatine kinase (MCK) promoter region (47Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) centered on the MEF2-responsive element with the sequence 5′GCAGAGGAGACAGCAAAGCGCCCTCTAAAAATAACTCCTTTCCCGGCGACCGAACCCTC (core MEF2 element underlined) was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. MEF2a protein was incubated in concentration ranges from 1 × 10−9 to 7 × 10−9m with 4 × 10−10m of32P-radiolabeled MCK promoter DNA in Incubation Buffer (12.5 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 250 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5% glycerol) and loaded on a 6% polyacrylamide gel with 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA (TBE) as running buffer. 400 V were applied for 10 min immediately after sample loading followed by 2–3 h at 200 V at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed on BAS-IP MP 2040S imaging plates (Fuji Film Inc.). Band intensities were recorded with a Fuji Film BAS-2500 PhosphorImager and quantified with software Advanced Image Data Analyzer AIDA/2D version 3.11 (Raytest Isotopenmessgeräte GmbH). The ratio of protein-DNA complex [PD] to free DNA [D] was obtained from the band intensity data and plotted against the concentration of free protein [P]. Linear regression yielded the reciprocal of the dissociation constantKD at the chosen conditions following Equation1, [PD][D]=1KD[P]Equation 1 RprcL or RprcS, respectively, was mixed with an excess (less than 10%) of CaM (assuming ε280 = 2560 m−1cm−1 for calmodulin) and incubated on ice (1 h) in a 1-ml volume at a total protein concentration of 2 mg/ml in Buffer C (25 mm BisTris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 6.0). The sample was passed through an S200 HR size exclusion column pre-equilibrated in Buffer C at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min with fractions collected at 1-min intervals. Peaks containing CaM-Rprc complex were identified by 18% SDS-PAGE and pooled separate from fractions containing excess CaM. Pooled complex was rechromatographed to yield a single symmetric peak in the A280 trace. The complex was concentrated to 0.5 ml, dialyzed extensively against Buffer E (10 mm BisTris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmDTT, 2 mm EGTA, pH 6.0), and passed through the S200 HR column pre-equilibrated in Buffer E. The split peak profiles were analyzed for protein content by SDS-PAGE. Unbound calmodulin and HDAC5 repressor core proteins were passed through the S200 HR column in Buffer C under the same conditions as above for comparison. Binding experiments were performed on a BIAcore 1000 biosensor system (Amersham Biosciences AB) at 20 °C. MEF2a protein (15–25 μl of 1 μm polypeptide in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5) was coupled through its amino groups to the sensor surface of a CM5 biosensor chip (Amersham Biosciences) usingN-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide chemistry as recommended by the manufacturer. After immobilizing 1200 resonance units of MEF2a, remaining activated groups on the sensor surface were inactivated with 1 mm ethanolamine. For control experiments, one sensor surface was treated as above in the absence of MEF2a protein. Interaction experiments between MEF2a and MCK promoter DNA (as above) were carried out with DNA concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 100 nm at a constant flow rate of 10 μl per min using Buffer M (12.5 mm HEPES-Na, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT) as running buffer. Between injections, the sensor chip was regenerated with 50 μl of Buffer M containing 500 mm NaCl. Binding experiments of HDAC5 RprcL protein to MEF2a were carried out in Buffer R1 (25 mmBisTris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.0) with protein concentrations ranging from 2 to 35 nm. RprcS has a lower theoretical pI (8.0) as compared with RprcL (9.95), and its titration curve shows a plateau between pH 7.0 and 9.0. Therefore, binding experiments of RprcS to MEF2a were carried out at pH 6.2. For both RprcL and RprcS, it was found that at the concentrations utilized, the best reproducibility of data was achieved by diluting protein solutions from a 1 μm stock with running buffer immediately prior to injection. To measure the interaction between calmodulin and repressor core protein, 1500 resonance units of biotinylated calmodulin were immobilized on a streptavidin-coated SA5 chip (Amersham Biosciences), and an uncoated streptavidin surface was used as a control. Measurements were performed in Buffer D (10 mm BisTris, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 6.2) at a flow rate of 20 μl per min in a range of 2–50 nmRprcS. The sensor surface was regenerated with buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and 5 mm EGTA instead of CaCl2. RprcS(L187G) mutant protein was measured similarly, however, in the concentration range of 50–400 nm. Nonspecific binding of protein or DNA to the respective control surface was not detectable under the conditions of our experiments. Data were evaluated using the BIAevaluation software package provided (Amersham Biosciences AB). Kinetic constants were obtained by fitting curves to a single site binding model (A + B = AB). Inhibition of HDAC5 repressor core binding to MEF2a by CaM was investigated using a sensor surface with 2000 resonance units of MEF2a immobilized. Buffer D was used as running buffer at a constant flow rate of 20 μl/min. RprcS was diluted to 30 nmfrom a 1 μm stock solution into Buffer D containing calmodulin at concentrations ranging from 30 nm to 3 μm. Sample was injected after 10 min of incubation at room temperature. Control spectra were recorded with sensor surface activated and deactivated in the absence of MEF2a protein as described above. HDAC5 contains a C-terminal catalytic domain and an N-terminal extension that mediated binding to MEF2 proteins (17Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The N-terminal part of the protein is highly homologous to the non-catalytic transcriptional co-repressor MITR (24Sparrow D.B. Miska E.A. Langley E. Reynaud-Deonauth S. Kotecha S. Towers N. Spohr G.

It has a glutamine-rich stretch close to its N terminus (Q in Fig. 1A) followed by a domain (A in Fig. 1A) that contains the 18-amino acid stretch identified as crucial for interaction with MEF2 (26Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Nicol R.L. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4070-4075Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar) centered around the 100% conserved STEVK 5-amino acid motif (amino acids 180–184 in HDAC5). Furthermore, a region homologous to the putative CaM binding domain delineated for HDAC4 (41McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6312-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) is present inA. The nuclear localization sequence (49Hicks G.R. Raikhel N.V. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 155-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) is contained in a third domain (B in Fig. 1A). SegmentsQ, A, and B are highly conserved in HDACs 4, 5, 7, and 9 and also in MITR from mouse and X. laevis with more than 60% identity between the proteins. Assuming that the glutamine-rich stretch constitutes a region with poorly defined geometry in the protein, we generated, based on homology alignment, a repressor core construct termed RprcL spanning amino acids 140–308 of the full-length protein. RprcL encompasses the conserved segments A and B (Fig.1A). Repressor core boundaries were placed in regions with low homology and having an amino acid composition indicating possible loops. We observed that purification of RprcL (see “Experimental Procedures”) consistently yielded, besides the 21-kDa full-length protein, a smaller product migrating at around 12 kDa on an SDS gel accounting for between 30 and 50% of total protein. This small fragment (termed “SmFr”) could be separated from full-length RprcL by ion exchange chromatography (Fig.2, lanes 2 and 3). N-terminal sequencing and MALDI mass spectrometry identified SmFr as a proteolytic breakdown product of RprcL starting at tryptophan 214 (Fig. 1B and TableI) and extending to the C-terminal vector-encoded His6 tag.

Prescott M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Synthesis/hydrolysis of ATP occurs on the structurally well characterized F1 sector comprised of five subunits α3-β3-γ1-δ1-ε1(2Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E.

The crystal structure of an incomplete mtATPase from yeast determined by Stock et al. (3Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) showed that the γ-δ-ε subunits form a central stalk that is closely associated with a ring of 10 copies of membrane-embedded subunit 9. Together these proteins constitute the “rotor” of mtATPase, which has been conclusively demonstrated to rotate during ATP synthesis/hydrolysis relative to the other subunits of the complex (5Hasler K.

In yeast mitochondria F0 is comprised of at least 12 different polypeptides: OSCP, b, d, e, f, g, h, i/j, and k that are nuclearly encoded, and subunits 6, 8, and 9 that are mitochondrially encoded (1Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). F0 has two important functions. First, some F0subunits form a “stator” stalk anchored in the membrane, which during coupled ATP synthesis/hydrolysis prevents futile rotation of mtATPase subunits relative to the rotor. This structure has been visualized in ATP synthases from several organisms (14Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 15Karrasch S. Walker J.E. J.

In the structurally less complex ATP synthase of Escherichia colithe stator stalk is composed of subunit δ and two copies of subunit b (17Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar). However, only a single copy of subunit b is present in the mtATPase of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (18Bateson M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Prescott M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7462-7466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar); thus, in conjunction with OSCP (the mitochondrial homolog of subunit δ), other F0 subunits contribute to form the stator stalk. Second, movement of protons through the membrane-embedded channel of F0 allows conversion of the proton gradient generated by respiratory chain activity into chemical energy, in the form of ATP made by phosphorylation of ADP on F1. Based on molecular genetic and biochemical studies in yeast the assembly and stability of the membrane-embedded proton channel of mtATPase depends on the presence of the three mitochondrially encoded protein subunits 6, 8, and 9 (19Nagley P. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 46-51Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Subunits 6 and 9 are the homologs of bacterial ATP synthase subunits a and c, respectively, and have well defined roles in proton channel function (20Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 154-160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Subunit 8 is not found in bacteria but is an additional subunit present in the mtATPase of mammals and fungi. The absence of all but one of these F0 subunits from the yeast F1-c10 crystal structure (3Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (1085) Google Scholar) highlights the need for additional biochemical approaches aimed at elucidating the structure and function of F0 subunits. In yeast subunit 8 (Y8) is a 48-amino acid intrinsic membrane protein essential for the assembly and function of mtATPase (1Devenish R.J. Prescott M. Roucou X. Nagley P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Whereas divergent in amino acid composition, Y8 and its other eukaryotic homologs exhibit three highly conserved regions: an N-terminal MPQL motif, a central hydrophobic domain (CHD), and a C-terminal positively charged region (21Velours J.

Detailed studies on genetically modified Y8 variants, allotopically expressed in yeast lacking endogenous Y8, have suggested that the N-terminal motif of Y8 plays a functional role in mtATPase (25Law R.H.

Biochem. 1999; 261: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) has shown that variants bearing either positive or negatively charged amino acids in the CHD display structural destabilization of the F1-F0 interaction but nevertheless retain function. Cysteine scanning mutagenesis has been used extensively to analyze membrane proteins in their native state and provides a powerful alternative for examining the molecular neighborhood surrounding membrane proteins (34Altenbach C. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Science. 1990; 248: 1088-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 35Frillingos S. Sahin-Toth M. Wu J. Kaback H.R.

In a previous study, analysis of allotopically expressed Y8 variants having a cysteine substitution at the N- or C-terminal residue of Y8 demonstrated that the CHD spans the inner mitochondrial membrane with Nout-Cinorientation (37Stephens A.N. Roucou X. Artika I.M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we have combined cysteine-scanning mutagenesis with allotopic expression to construct a series of single cysteine replacements encompassing the entire length of the Y8 protein (excluding three residues within the C-terminal positively charged region whose replacement would abrogate function (28Papakonstantinou T. Galanis M. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)). Without exception each cysteine replacement was tolerated and all of the expressed Y8 variants restored mtATPase function in cells lacking endogenous Y8, demonstrating that none of the substituted amino acid residues of Y8 are essential for either ATP synthesis/hydrolysis activity or proton flow. Specific labeling experiments using the thiol-modifying chemical reagent fluorescein 5-maleimide (FM) showed that the membrane-spanning CHD of Y8 encompasses residues 15 to 35. By assessing the accessibility of introduced cysteine residues to FM in partially dissociated mtATPase complexes, the C terminus of Y8 was found to be occluded by other mtATPase subunits, especially in a small region close to Val-40 demonstrated to play an important role in maintaining the structural interaction between the F1 and F0 sectors. In addition, site-directed cross-linking experiments demonstrated extensive interactions between Y8 and subunits d, f, b, and 6. These results lead us to propose a significant role for Y8 as part of the stator stalk of mtATPase. The gene cassettes N9L-D/Y8-1 and N9L-D/Y8-1-FLAG, yeast expression vector pPD72, and yeast strains YM2 and FTC2 were as described previously (37Stephens A.N. Roucou X. Artika I.M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Briefly, each gene cassette encodes a full-length wild-type Y8 protein bearing a 7-amino acid extension at the N terminus (YSSEISS, numbered from −7 to −1), which is retained following import of Y8 into mitochondria and processing of the N9L mitochondrial import sequence by matrix protease. The N9L-D/Y8-1-FLAG construct expresses the same protein bearing a C-terminal FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK). Cells expressing the N9L-D/Y8-1 cassette are denoted YM2, those expressing N9L-D/Y8-1-FLAG are denoted FTC2. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on the N9L-D/Y8-1 gene cassette as described (37Stephens A.N. Roucou X. Artika I.M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) to generate 46 single cysteine replacements in the expressed Y8 proteins. The Y8(M1C) FLAG variant was constructed by ligation of a BamHI/KpnI fragment containing the N9L-D sequence and the first 15 nucleotides of the synthetic Y8 gene bearing the M1C mutation into a similarly digested pUC9 vector containing the FTC2 variant. The (M1C) FLAG cassette was then excised by BamHI/NotI restriction digestion and ligated into the pPD72 vector as described (37Stephens A.N. Roucou X. Artika I.M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A DNA sequence encoding an HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was introduced into the N9L-D/Y8-1 cassette using two rounds of PCR mutagenesis. The expressed protein is designated NHAY8. First, the upstream and downstream flanking primer pair, 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3′ and 5′-GGAACGTCGTATGGGTAAGACGAGATCTCGGAAGAGTAGGC-3′, respectively, were used to introduce nucleotides into the N9L-D/Y8-1 cassette specifying the amino acid sequence YPYDV inserted between the YSSEISS sequence that was retained following import of allotopically expressed Y8 into mitochondria and the N terminus of the Y8 peptide. A second round of PCR using the flanking primer pair 5′-CAGGAAACAGCTATGACC-3′ and 5′-GGCTCGAGGAGGCGTAGTCAGGAACGTCGTATGGGTAAGACGAGATC-3′ was then used to incorporate adjacent nucleotides into the N9L-D/Y8-1 cassette specifying amino acids PDYA, to form the complete HA epitope, along with three additional serine residues between this epitope and the Y8 passenger protein. Thus, the N9L-D/NHAY8-1 cassette encodes a protein that contains the N9L-D-YSSEISS sequence (as for YM2) followed by the sequence YPYDVPDYA-SSS-subunit 8, with the original matrix protease cleavage site maintained. A BamHI/XhoI restriction fragment bearing the nucleotide sequence encoding N9L-D/NHA was ligated into similarly digested pUC9 containing the gene cassette encoding selected N9L-D/Y8-1 cysteine variants to create constructs NHAY8(L4C), NHAY8(F7C), NHAY8(M10C), NHAY8(F44C), and NHAY8(L48C). The fidelity of all constructs was checked by DNA sequencing. Yeast strain M31 (MATα ade1 his6)[aap1−] lacking endogenous Y8 has been described previously (30Marzuki S. Watkins L.C. Choo W.M. Biochim. Biophys Acta. 1989; 975: 222-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). M31 cells were transformed by the method of Klebe et al. (38Klebe R.J. Harriss J.V. Sharp Z.D. Douglas M.G. Gene (Amst.). 1983; 25: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) with the pPD72 expression vector that carries a functional ADE1 gene (28Papakonstantinou T. Galanis M. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Transformants displaying the Ade+ phenotype were selected and restoration of respiratory-competent phenotype by the expressed Y8 cysteine variants was assessed by testing growth on medium containing ethanol as the sole carbon source. Generation times, ATP hydrolysis activity in isolated mitochondria, and its sensitivity to oligomycin were measured as described previously (39Law R.H. Manon S. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 133-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Comparisons (Student's ttest) were made against strain YM2 (28Papakonstantinou T. Galanis M. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), allotopically expressing unmodified Y8. Thiol-specific labeling of mitochondrial proteins by FM was carried out for 4 h on mitochondria osmotically lysed by exposure to a hypotonic solution (denoted lysate) as described (37Stephens A.N. Roucou X. Artika I.M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Isolated proteolipids were separated by Tricine SDS-PAGE (18% polyacrylamide) according to the method of Schagger and von Jagow (40Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10470) Google Scholar). Analysis of protein fluorescence was as described (37Stephens A.N. Roucou X. Artika I.M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). For Y8 cysteine variants that remained unmodified under these conditions, labeling by FM was repeated as above in the presence of 1% SDS prior to proteolipid extraction. Cross-linking of mitochondrial proteins using the heterobifunctional reagentsp-azidophenacyl bromide (APA-Br) andN-(4-p-azidosalicylamidobutyl)-3′-(pyridyldithio)-propionamide (APDP) was as described, except that mitochondrial membranes equivalent to 0.5 mg of protein were used (37Stephens A.N. Roucou X. Artika I.M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cross-linking using CuCl2 was performed as follows. Mitochondrial membranes (equivalent to 0.5 mg of protein) were pelleted at 131,440 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 200 μl of buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, 2 mmMgCl2, pH 7.5). CuCl2 was added to 1.5 mm (from a 25 mm stock solution, prepared fresh) and the samples were incubated on ice for 2 h. EDTA was then added to 10 mm to chelate the remaining Cu2+ and the samples were incubated for 5 min. Mitochondrial membranes were then pelleted at 131,440 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C and the pellet resuspended in 125 μl of 4% SDS (w/v) and 125 μl of dissociation buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS (w/v), 50% glycerol (v/v), 0.02% bromphenol blue (w/v), pH 6.7). To reduce samples 1 μl of 14.3 mm 2-mercaptoethanol was added and the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min, then at 65 °C for 10 min prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Removal of the F1 sector from mitochondrial membranes was achieved using the modified method of McEnery et al. (41McEnery M.W. Hullihen J. Pedersen P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12029-12036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membranes (equivalent to 2 mg of protein) were pelleted at 131,440 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and then resuspended in 0.8 ml of PAB buffer (0.15 mK2HPO4, 25 mm EDTA, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.9). After 5 min incubation on ice, the mitochondrial membranes were centrifuged as before and the pellet resuspended in 1.0 ml of GPAB buffer (0.15 mK2HPO4, 25 mm EDTA, 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 3.0 m guanidine-HCl, pH 7.9). Following incubation on ice for 13 min, membranes were pelleted as before and washed twice in PA buffer (150 mmK2HPO4, 25 mm EDTA, pH 7.9) by resuspension and centrifugation. For fluorescent labeling experiments membrane samples were then resuspended in 0.2 ml of buffer A and labeling performed as described above. Samples not intended for labeling studies were prepared for denaturing glycine SDS-PAGE as described (37Stephens A.N. Roucou X. Artika I.M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Monomeric mtATPase complexes were isolated using clear native gel electrophoresis according to the method of Arnold et al. (42Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schagger H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7170-7178Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), but with the omission of Serva Blue G dye from the sample. Mitochondrial membranes (equivalent to 100 μg of protein) were pelleted at 131,440 × g for 15 min at 4 °C and resuspended in 20 μl of native gel sample buffer (50 mmNaCl, 2 mm aminohexanoic acid, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm imidazole, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lauryl maltoside was added to a final concentration of 2.86% (w/v) and the samples (total sample volume 26 μl) were incubated on ice for 20 min. Insoluble material was pelleted at 131,440 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and 20 μl of the sample was applied to a 4–13% polyacrylamide gradient gel (dimensions 13 × 10 × 0.075 cm). Electrophoresis was carried out for 3 h with an initial current of 15 mA and voltage increasing to a maximum of 500 V. On completion of electrophoresis, gels were transferred to small plastic containers and in situ ATP hydrolase activity was assessed using the method of Yoshida et al. (43Yoshida M. Sone N. Hirata H. Kagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7910-7916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Gels were photographed, then fixed in a solution of methanol (50%) (v/v), acetic acid (10%) (w/v) for 30 min, and then stained in acetic acid (10%) (v/v), Serva Blue G dye (0.025%) (w/v) overnight. Gels were destained in acetic acid (10%) (v/v) for at least 2 h with several changes of solution until protein bands were distinctly blue against a clear background. Coomassie-stained gels were analyzed using a ProXPRESS multiwavelength fluorimager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Phoretix 2D analysis software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom). Denaturing second dimension gel electrophoresis analysis of isolated mtATPase complexes was performed as follows. Monomeric mtATPase complexes isolated using native gel electrophoresis and stained with Serva Blue G dye were carefully excised from the gel and each polyacrylamide fragment rinsed in 1 ml of distilled water in a 1.5-ml snap-cap tube. After a 60-s centrifugation at 20,798 × g, the water was aspirated off and 50 μl of SDS (5%) (w/v) was added to the tube. The gel fragment was then finely ground using a thin glass rod and centrifuged at 20,798 × g for 1 min. Grinding and centrifugation were repeated and then 50 μl of 2× dissociation buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, 2% SDS (w/v), 50% glycerol (v/v), 0.02% bromphenol blue (w/v), 2% 2-mercaptoethanol (v/v), pH 6.7) was added to the SDS-gel slurry and the samples were heated to 65 °C for 5 min. Following incubation at 4 °C overnight, samples were stored at −20 °C until use. Prior to electrophoresis, the samples were heated to 65 °C for 5 min and then centrifuged at 20,798 × g for 5 min. Immediately following centrifugation 20 μl of the sample was removed, taking care to avoid any fragments of acrylamide gel present in the tube. Samples were electrophoresed (glycine SDS-PAGE) in a 15% polyacrylamide denaturing gel and transferred to PVDF membrane for immunoblotting. Membranes prepared as above were probed with mouse monoclonal antibodies against either the FLAG (diluted 1:380) or HA epitopes (diluted 1:2000) (Sigma), or yeast mtATPase subunits α (diluted 1:5000), β (diluted 1:7000), or b (diluted 1:5000) from our library of mtATPase-specific antibodies (44Hadikusumo R.G. Hertzog P.J. Marzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antisera were also employed against yeast mtATPase subunits γ, d, or OSCP (diluted 1:1000) (44Hadikusumo R.G. Hertzog P.J. Marzuki S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 765: 258-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), f, 6, or h (diluted 1:10000, kindly provided by Dr. J. Velours), and e, g, i/j, or k (diluted 1:500, kindly provided by Dr. R. A. Stuart). Secondary antibodies and detection were as described (37Stephens A.N. Roucou X. Artika I.M. Devenish R.J. Nagley P. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 6443-6451Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Antibody binding was quantified using ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). A total of 46 single cysteine replacements were made in the Y8 protein at positions ranging from the amino acid directly preceding the N-terminal methionine of allotopically expressed Y8 (position −1) to the most C-terminal residue (position 48). The lysine at position 37 and two arginines at positions 42 and 47 were not substituted as each of these residues contributes to the C-terminal positively charged region required for assembly of Y8 into mtATPase (28Papakonstantinou T. Galanis M. Nagley P. Devenish R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1144: 22-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To test the functionality in vivo of Y8 cysteine variants, M31(aap1−) cells expressing each single cysteine variant were plated onto medium containing ethanol as the sole carbon source. Without exception, expression of each variant was able to restore respiratory function. However, cells expressing either the Y39C or V40C Y8 variants displayed apparently slower growth on solid medium than did control strain YM2 at 37 °C, yet displayed normal growth at either 18 or 28 °C. To further assess functionality of the Y8 variants at the whole cell level, the generation time of each Y8 variant-expressing strain was assessed in liquid medium containing ethanol as the sole carbon source. Of the 46 cysteine variants tested, only three had a significant effect (Student's t test) on whole cell growth rate. Expression of the L38C variant resulted in a significant decrease (p < 0.01) in generation time compared with strain YM2 expressing unmodified Y8 (TableI). The reason for this increased rate of growth is unclear and has not been examined further. Because yeast should have an excess capacity for ATP production, increased ATP synthesis should not promote growth. By contrast, expression of Y8 variants Y39C or V40C, respectively, displayed a significant increase in generation time compared with that of strain YM2 (p< 0.01 in each case) (Table I).Table IGrowth properties and mitochondrial ATP hydrolase activities of cells expressing Y8 variantsStrainGeneration timeSignificance1-aStudent's t test performed on mean generation times.

https://openalex.org/W2016731588,"The mechanism of proton pumping by P-type H+-ATPases is still unclear. In the plant P-type plasma membrane H+-ATPase AHA2, two charged residues, Arg655 and Asp684, are conserved in transmembrane segments M5 and M6, respectively, a region that has been shown be contribute to ion coordination in related P-type ATPases. Substitution of Arg655 with either alanine or aspartate resulted in mutant enzymes exhibiting a significant shift in the P-type ATPase E1P-E2P conformational equilibrium. The mutant proteins accumulated in theE1P conformation, but were capable of conducting proton transport. This points to an important role of Arg655 in theE1P-E2P conformational transition. The presence of a carboxylate moiety at position Asp684 proved essential for coupling between initial proton binding and proton pumping. The finding that the carboxylate side chain of Asp684 contributes to the proton-binding site and appears to function as an absolutely essential proton acceptor along the proton transport pathway is discussed in the context of a possible proton pumping mechanism of P-type H+-ATPases.

It is a major protein at this membrane, where it controls cytoplasmic and apoplastic pH by generating the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient that serves as a driving force for nutrient uptake (1Morsomme P. Boutry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 2Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane H+-ATPase belongs to the family of P-type ATPases, which include the plasma membrane-bound Ca2+- and Na+/K+-ATPases, and has several other members found throughout prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (3Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 4Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Members of the P-type ATPase family transport a variety of cations including H+, Na+, K+, Cu2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+.Structures of P-type ATPases reveal the presence of 10 transmembrane helices including large cytoplasmic extensions (5Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 1998; 392: 840-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 6Zhang P. Toyoshima C. Yonekura K. Green N.M. Stokes D.L.

The catalytic mechanism of P-type ATPase transport involves at least four different enzyme conformational states named E1,E1P, E2P, andE2 (the P designating phosphorylated intermediates), with theE1P-E2P transition accompanying the transfer of ion(s) across the membrane (8Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). High resolution three-dimensional crystal structures of theE1 and the E2conformations, respectively, have been solved for the animal SR Ca2+-ATPase (7Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

These structures indicate substantial domain movements of P-type ATPases in both cytoplasmic and transmembrane parts during catalysis. Significant progress has been made to map the transport pathways in representative P-type ATPases such as Ca2+- and Na+/K+-ATPases (7Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

These studies have established the presence of cation-binding pockets, each of which are formed by several coordinating groups situated in transmembrane helices M4, M5, M6, and M8. However, the molecular determinants of cation specificity have not been determined for any P-type ATPase and the mechanism of proton transport by P-type ATPases is not well characterized.Protons in solution (as H3O+) form solvation structures characteristic of cationic solvation. This suggests that the plant H+-ATPase possibly could mediate hydronium ion transport (17Briskin D.P. Hanson J.B. J. Exp. Bot. 1992; 43: 269-289Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, in a number of different proton pumps that have been described in molecular detail, H+ seems to be the transported species, and H+ is in these proton pumps believed to be transported along a proton transduction chain (a proton wire) comprising alternating groups of proton donors and proton acceptors. Whether P-type proton pumps also could mediate H+ transport along a proton transduction chain is unknown.In this study, we investigated whether two charged residues, Arg655AHA2 and Asp684AHA2, situated in transmembrane segments M5 and M6, respectively, might play a role in the proton pumping mechanism of plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Transmembrane segment M5 and M6 are connected by a very short stretch of extracellularly located amino acid residues and are therefore expected to form a hairpin loop. During proteolysis of the related Na+/K+- and H+/K+-ATPases, inclusion of potassium ions stabilizes the M5M6 hairpin loop, and it has been suggested that this moiety moves in and out of the membrane during catalysis (18Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Gatto C. Lutsenko S. Moo Shin J. Sachs G. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol.

Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) that the M5M6 segment is a mobile structure, somehow coupling ATP hydrolysis to cation transport. The selected residues Arg655AHA2 and Asp684AHA2 are conserved in all plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases and are close to the predicted proton-binding site in atomic models of plant (20Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and fungal (21Kuhlbrandt W. Zeelen J. Dietrich J. Science. 2002; 297: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) P-type H+-ATPases. Asp684AHA2 is strictly conserved in H+-, Na+/K+- (Asp808), H+/K+- (Asp804), and Ca2+-ATPases (Asp800). In the SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase it coordinates both of the two Ca2+ ions bound (7Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). In a homology model of AHA2 (20Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Arg655AHA2 seems to be equivalent to Glu771SERCA, a residue involved in direct coordination of Ca2+ in SERCA1. One of the residues, the negatively charged Asp684AHA2, has previously been implicated in enzyme conformational changes in the plant H+-ATPase (22Buch-Pedersen M.J. Venema K. Serrano R. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39167-39173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The other, the positively charged Arg655AHA2, has not been assigned a role so far.DISCUSSIONThe goal of the present study was to determine the role in proton transport of conserved residues Arg655 and Asp684 situated in the middle of transmembrane segments M5 and M6, respectively, of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Our results provide new insight into the mechanism by which P-type proton pumps transport protons across the membrane.The Positive Charge at Arg655 Is Involved in the E1P-E2P TransitionAll tested Arg655 substitutions (R655K, R655A, and R655D) were capable of catalyzing ATP-coupled proton transport albeit with different efficiencies. Thus, whereas the R655K substituted enzyme was almost as efficient as the wild-type plant H+-ATPase in carrying out ATP hydrolysis and proton transport, the two non-conservative substitutions (R655A and R655D) resulted in enzymes that were severely inhibited in both ATP hydrolysis and proton transport.R655A and R655D mutant ATPases were almost insensitive toward vanadate, an inhibitor of the E2 conformation, but, as judged from their slight ability to carry out ATP dependent proton transport, both mutants were able to carry out a complete catalytic cycle. The phosphorylated intermediate accumulated in the R655A and the R655D proteins to levels corresponding to 3–4 times the value in the unmodified protein. It was demonstrated that the high level ofEP in these proteins could be ascribed theE1P phosphoform. Based on the unaltered pH dependence and this high level of E1P accumulating in the R655A and R655D H+-ATPases, this study do not suggest a role for Arg655 in the initial proton-binding event allowing E1P formation to proceed. Rather, in R655A and R655D, theE1P-E2P conformational transition occurs at a significantly reduced rate. Arginine is the most basic amino acid (pKa∼12.5), suggesting that Arg655 is likely to be found in the protonated form. We conclude that the positive charge of Arg655 must be ascribed an important, although not essential, role in theE1P-E2P conformational transition. We did not find evidence for a structural salt bridge between Arg655 and Asp684.The Amino Acid Side Chain at Position 684 Influences Proton Affinity and the E1-E1P Conformational TransitionIn catalytic models of P-type ATPases, the species to be transported must be bound before any ATP hydrolysis can take place and before the E1-E1P conformational change. All Asp684 substitutions of the plant H+-ATPase tested showed capabilities of both formation of the E1P phosphorylated intermediate and ATP hydrolysis. Thus, the biochemical characteristics of the amino acid side chain at position 684 appear not to be essential for the specific proton-binding event in E1 that allows the formation of E1P. Alternatively, removal of the negative charge at position Asp684 mimics the protonated state of this residue.The Carboxylate of Asp684 as a Molecular Determinant for Proton TransportBy insertion of a single CH2group into the aspartate at position 684 (D684E) in the plant H+-ATPase, ATP hydrolytic activity was hampered (∼15% of wild-type). Reconstitution experiments demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis was coupled to proton transport. Therefore, a precise location of the carboxylate at position 684 must be important for efficient ATP hydrolysis and proton transport. However, although the precise location of this carboxylate is not essential for ATP dependent proton transport, it seems that the presence of a carboxylate at position 684 is absolutely necessary for any coupling between ATP hydrolysis and proton transport to take place. Thus, all Asp684substitutions in which the proton acceptor capabilities of Asp684 have been removed (D684N, D684A, D684V, and D684R) showed a complete lack of coupling between ATPase activity and proton translocation. Still the mutant proteins show relatively high levels of ATP hydrolysis and steady-state phosphoenzyme.Among the substitutions of Asp684 tested, it appeared that D684N, D684A, D684V, and D684R exhibited a complete block in normal P-type enzymatic E1P-E2P transition. Thus, in addition to the fact that no proton pumping accompanied ATP hydrolysis, these mutant proteins were completely insensitive toward vanadate. In particular, following replacement of the Asp684 carboxylate by carbamide (D684N), the mutated H+-ATPase accumulated in the E1P conformational state, and the rate-limiting step regarding ATP hydrolysis in this mutant is most likely determined by the rate of spontaneous E1P dephosphorylation.Taken together, the absence of a carboxylate at position 684 in the H+-ATPase completely abolishes any enzymatic transition from E1P to E2P. Our results therefore demonstrates that the carboxylate group of Asp684 is absolutely essential for the transfer of protons during the E1P-E2P conformational transition, which is hypothesized to accompany transport of the bound species across the membrane. This strongly suggests that the carboxylate of Asp684 function as a molecular determinant for proton translocation across the membrane in plant P-type H+-ATPases.Mechanism of Proton Transport by P-type Proton PumpsThis study provides some clues into the biochemistry of the initial proton-binding event allowing E1P formation (theE1 proton-binding site). The nature of the amino acid side chain at position 684 influences binding of the proton to this E1 proton-binding site. Several groups including Asp684, none of which need to be essential, may contribute to initial coordination of the transported species but further conformational transitions involve Asp684 as an essential residue. The E1 proton-binding site could include a proton acceptor group or a group of atoms coordinating a hydrated proton (H3O+). A H3O+ coordination center could include the Asp684 carbonyl side chain oxygen as one of the coordinating groups. In such a scenario, the proton could arrive to an already bound water molecule.The function of Asp684AHA2 could resemble the functions of Asp85 and Asp61 in the non-related proton pumps bacteriorhodopsin (BR; 35, 36) and F1F0-ATPase (37Fillingame R.H. Jiang W. Dmitriev O.Y. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 9-17Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Vik S.B. Antonio B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30364-30369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. In an essential protonation event, the carboxylates of these residues receives the proton during catalysis. Among the amino acid residues involved in the proton transfer reaction of BR, Asp85 is the only indispensable. A substitution to other than glutamate of Asp85 results in mutant proteins completely devoid of proton transporting activity (39Mogi T. Stern L.J. Marti T. Chao H. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

A. 1990; 87: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). As has been suggested for the Neurospora PMA1 H+-ATPase (21Kuhlbrandt W. Zeelen J. Dietrich J. Science. 2002; 297: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the presence of a conserved arginine (Arg655AHA2/Arg82BR) close to a conserved aspartate working as the essential proton acceptor group during catalysis (Asp684AHA2/Asp85BR) could resemble the proton-binding site in bacteriorhodopsin. The pKa of Asp85BR is influenced by the orientation of Arg82BR, and by modulating pKa values of other groups also, Arg82BR modulates the proton transfer trough the protein (40Subramaniam S. Marti T. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 41Govindjee R. Misra S. Balashov S.P. Ebrey T.G. Crouch R.K. Menick D. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 1011-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Our finding that non-conservative substitutions of Arg655 in the plant H+-ATPase significantly slows down the E1P-E2P transition would be in accordance with an equivalent role of Arg655 in the plant H+-ATPase.The major finding of this communication is that the carboxyl group of Asp684 contributes to the proton-binding site of the AHA2 P-type H+-ATPase. A negative charged oxygen of the Asp684 carboxyl side chain group could function as an essential proton acceptor/donor during transport of protons across the membrane. This suggests that the mechanism of proton transport by P-type H+-ATPases basically could be similar to the mechanism utilized by proton pumps such as BR and F1F0 ATP synthase, in which proton transfer utilizes protonable side chain groups as proton donors and proton acceptors in a timely fashion. An essential protein of the plant plasma membrane is the H+-ATPase. It is a major protein at this membrane, where it controls cytoplasmic and apoplastic pH by generating the transmembrane electrochemical proton gradient that serves as a driving force for nutrient uptake (1Morsomme P. Boutry M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1465: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 2Palmgren M.G. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 52: 817-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). The plasma membrane H+-ATPase belongs to the family of P-type ATPases, which include the plasma membrane-bound Ca2+- and Na+/K+-ATPases, and has several other members found throughout prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells (3Moller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 4Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). Members of the P-type ATPase family transport a variety of cations including H+, Na+, K+, Cu2+, Ca2+, and Mg2+. Structures of P-type ATPases reveal the presence of 10 transmembrane helices including large cytoplasmic extensions (5Auer M. Scarborough G.A. Kühlbrandt W.

The catalytic mechanism of P-type ATPase transport involves at least four different enzyme conformational states named E1,E1P, E2P, andE2 (the P designating phosphorylated intermediates), with theE1P-E2P transition accompanying the transfer of ion(s) across the membrane (8Jorgensen P.L. Andersen J.P. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 103: 95-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). High resolution three-dimensional crystal structures of theE1 and the E2conformations, respectively, have been solved for the animal SR Ca2+-ATPase (7Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

These structures indicate substantial domain movements of P-type ATPases in both cytoplasmic and transmembrane parts during catalysis. Significant progress has been made to map the transport pathways in representative P-type ATPases such as Ca2+- and Na+/K+-ATPases (7Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H.

These studies have established the presence of cation-binding pockets, each of which are formed by several coordinating groups situated in transmembrane helices M4, M5, M6, and M8. However, the molecular determinants of cation specificity have not been determined for any P-type ATPase and the mechanism of proton transport by P-type ATPases is not well characterized. Protons in solution (as H3O+) form solvation structures characteristic of cationic solvation. This suggests that the plant H+-ATPase possibly could mediate hydronium ion transport (17Briskin D.P. Hanson J.B. J. Exp. Bot. 1992; 43: 269-289Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, in a number of different proton pumps that have been described in molecular detail, H+ seems to be the transported species, and H+ is in these proton pumps believed to be transported along a proton transduction chain (a proton wire) comprising alternating groups of proton donors and proton acceptors. Whether P-type proton pumps also could mediate H+ transport along a proton transduction chain is unknown. In this study, we investigated whether two charged residues, Arg655AHA2 and Asp684AHA2, situated in transmembrane segments M5 and M6, respectively, might play a role in the proton pumping mechanism of plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Transmembrane segment M5 and M6 are connected by a very short stretch of extracellularly located amino acid residues and are therefore expected to form a hairpin loop. During proteolysis of the related Na+/K+- and H+/K+-ATPases, inclusion of potassium ions stabilizes the M5M6 hairpin loop, and it has been suggested that this moiety moves in and out of the membrane during catalysis (18Lutsenko S. Anderko R. Kaplan J.H. Proc. Natl. Acd. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7936-7940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 19Gatto C. Lutsenko S. Moo Shin J. Sachs G. Kaplan J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13737-13740Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is evident from the crystal structures of SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase in two conformations (7Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar, 9Toyoshima C. Nomura H. Nature. 2002; 418: 605-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) that the M5M6 segment is a mobile structure, somehow coupling ATP hydrolysis to cation transport. The selected residues Arg655AHA2 and Asp684AHA2 are conserved in all plant plasma membrane H+-ATPases and are close to the predicted proton-binding site in atomic models of plant (20Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and fungal (21Kuhlbrandt W. Zeelen J. Dietrich J. Science. 2002; 297: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) P-type H+-ATPases. Asp684AHA2 is strictly conserved in H+-, Na+/K+- (Asp808), H+/K+- (Asp804), and Ca2+-ATPases (Asp800). In the SERCA1 Ca2+-ATPase it coordinates both of the two Ca2+ ions bound (7Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). In a homology model of AHA2 (20Bukrinsky J.T. Buch-Pedersen M.J. Larsen S. Palmgren M.G. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), Arg655AHA2 seems to be equivalent to Glu771SERCA, a residue involved in direct coordination of Ca2+ in SERCA1. One of the residues, the negatively charged Asp684AHA2, has previously been implicated in enzyme conformational changes in the plant H+-ATPase (22Buch-Pedersen M.J. Venema K. Serrano R. Palmgren M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39167-39173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The other, the positively charged Arg655AHA2, has not been assigned a role so far. DISCUSSIONThe goal of the present study was to determine the role in proton transport of conserved residues Arg655 and Asp684 situated in the middle of transmembrane segments M5 and M6, respectively, of the plant plasma membrane H+-ATPase. Our results provide new insight into the mechanism by which P-type proton pumps transport protons across the membrane.The Positive Charge at Arg655 Is Involved in the E1P-E2P TransitionAll tested Arg655 substitutions (R655K, R655A, and R655D) were capable of catalyzing ATP-coupled proton transport albeit with different efficiencies. Thus, whereas the R655K substituted enzyme was almost as efficient as the wild-type plant H+-ATPase in carrying out ATP hydrolysis and proton transport, the two non-conservative substitutions (R655A and R655D) resulted in enzymes that were severely inhibited in both ATP hydrolysis and proton transport.R655A and R655D mutant ATPases were almost insensitive toward vanadate, an inhibitor of the E2 conformation, but, as judged from their slight ability to carry out ATP dependent proton transport, both mutants were able to carry out a complete catalytic cycle. The phosphorylated intermediate accumulated in the R655A and the R655D proteins to levels corresponding to 3–4 times the value in the unmodified protein. It was demonstrated that the high level ofEP in these proteins could be ascribed theE1P phosphoform. Based on the unaltered pH dependence and this high level of E1P accumulating in the R655A and R655D H+-ATPases, this study do not suggest a role for Arg655 in the initial proton-binding event allowing E1P formation to proceed. Rather, in R655A and R655D, theE1P-E2P conformational transition occurs at a significantly reduced rate. Arginine is the most basic amino acid (pKa∼12.5), suggesting that Arg655 is likely to be found in the protonated form. We conclude that the positive charge of Arg655 must be ascribed an important, although not essential, role in theE1P-E2P conformational transition. We did not find evidence for a structural salt bridge between Arg655 and Asp684.The Amino Acid Side Chain at Position 684 Influences Proton Affinity and the E1-E1P Conformational TransitionIn catalytic models of P-type ATPases, the species to be transported must be bound before any ATP hydrolysis can take place and before the E1-E1P conformational change. All Asp684 substitutions of the plant H+-ATPase tested showed capabilities of both formation of the E1P phosphorylated intermediate and ATP hydrolysis. Thus, the biochemical characteristics of the amino acid side chain at position 684 appear not to be essential for the specific proton-binding event in E1 that allows the formation of E1P. Alternatively, removal of the negative charge at position Asp684 mimics the protonated state of this residue.The Carboxylate of Asp684 as a Molecular Determinant for Proton TransportBy insertion of a single CH2group into the aspartate at position 684 (D684E) in the plant H+-ATPase, ATP hydrolytic activity was hampered (∼15% of wild-type). Reconstitution experiments demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis was coupled to proton transport. Therefore, a precise location of the carboxylate at position 684 must be important for efficient ATP hydrolysis and proton transport. However, although the precise location of this carboxylate is not essential for ATP dependent proton transport, it seems that the presence of a carboxylate at position 684 is absolutely necessary for any coupling between ATP hydrolysis and proton transport to take place. Thus, all Asp684substitutions in which the proton acceptor capabilities of Asp684 have been removed (D684N, D684A, D684V, and D684R) showed a complete lack of coupling between ATPase activity and proton translocation. Still the mutant proteins show relatively high levels of ATP hydrolysis and steady-state phosphoenzyme.Among the substitutions of Asp684 tested, it appeared that D684N, D684A, D684V, and D684R exhibited a complete block in normal P-type enzymatic E1P-E2P transition. Thus, in addition to the fact that no proton pumping accompanied ATP hydrolysis, these mutant proteins were completely insensitive toward vanadate. In particular, following replacement of the Asp684 carboxylate by carbamide (D684N), the mutated H+-ATPase accumulated in the E1P conforma"

Each of these proteins has specific but different effects on the pump kinetics and also a different tissue distribution.

They provide the means to alter pump properties in specific target tissues, cell types, or physiological states without affecting it elsewhere. It remains to be seen whether this is the true physiological function of these proteins. CHIF is an aldosterone-induced gene, expressed only in kidney collecting duct and distal colon surface cells (10Attali B. Latter H. Rachamim N. Garty H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Both CHIF and γ are immunoprecipitated by antibodies raised against the α subunit of the Na,K-ATPase, and the co-immunoprecipitation is efficient only in conditions that preserve native pump structure (8Garty H. Lindzen M. Scanfano R. Aizman R. Fuzesi M. Goldshleger R. Farman N. Blostein R. Karlish S.J.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F607-F615Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 19Garty H. Lindzen M.

The effects of γ and CHIF on the pump kinetics are, however, quite different. γ raises the apparent affinity for ATP by shifting the E1-E2 conformational equilibrium toward E1, and reduces apparent affinity for cytoplasmic Na+ ions by increasing the affinity of cytoplasmic K+ ions as competitors for cytoplasmic Na+ ions (5Therien A.G.

On the other hand, CHIF increases the affinity of the pump for cell Na+ and has no effect on the affinity for ATP (7Béguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K.

Although the functional effects of CHIF and γ appear to be well established, it is not known which domains and which residues interact with the α and/or β subunits and affect the pump kinetics. The current study provides the first systematic analysis of structure-function relations of CHIF and γ. It is demonstrated that the stability in detergent of the complexes formed with the α and β subunits is determined by the transmembrane segments, especially the residues Gly45, Met55, and Ala56. The trans-membrane segment also determines the opposite effects of CHIF and γ on the Na+ affinity, but the amino acids involved in this functional effect are different from those responsible for stable interactions with α. cDNAs, Antibodies, and Transfected Cell Lines—cDNAs that contain the coding sequences of rat CHIF, γa and γb, subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pIRES-hyg (Clontech), were described previously (8Garty H.

The various domains in CHIF were defined as follows: extracellular, Met1–Gln38; transmembrane, Leu39–Leu57; and intracellular, Ser58–Thr87. These domains were replaced by the corresponding regions in rat γa or γb using standard recombinant DNA procedures and verified by sequencing. HeLa cells overexpressing the rat α1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase (HeLa-α1 cells, kindly provided by Dr. J. B.

Immunoprecipitation, Western Blotting, and 86Rb+Fluxes— Transfected HeLa-α1 cells were solubilized in different concentrations of C12E10 in the presence of Rb+ and ouabain.

The blots were overlaid with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti rabbit IgG (1:10,000) and analyzed by enhanced chemiluminescence. The abundance of FXYD message in stably transfected cell clones was determined by semi-quantitative PCR. RNA was extracted using TriReagent® (Molecular Research Center, Inc.), and cDNA was reverse transcribed from the poly(A)+ tail using SuperScript 2 RNase H (Invitrogen). It was amplified in LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) using specific primers corresponding to the FXYD and the pIRES-HYG sequences. The data were normalized by parallel amplification of GAPDH. 86Rb+ uptake was measured in monensin-permeabilized transfected HeLa-α1 cells as detailed in Refs. 8Garty H. Lindzen M. Scanfano R.

Previously, we demonstrated that CHIF, γ, and phospholemman are specifically co-immunoprecipitated with the α subunit of Na,K-ATPase (6Crambert G. Fuzesi M. Garty H. Karlish S. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 8Garty H. Lindzen M. Scanfano R. Aizman R. Fuzesi M. Goldshleger R. Farman N. Blostein R. Karlish S.J.D. Am. J.

For both CHIF and γ co-immunoprecipitation was efficient only in conditions known to preserve the native pump conformations, namely when solubilization of membranes was done with C12E10 in the presence of Rb+ plus ouabain or Na+ plus oligomycin. Fig. 1 depicts an experiment in which HeLa-α1 cells stably transfected with either CHIF or γb were solubilized with increasing concentrations of C12E10 plus Rb+ and ouabain and subjected to immunoprecipitation by an anti-α antibody. In both cases the FXYD protein co-immunoprecipitated with α. However, quantitative differences between CHIF and γ were apparent. Although for γ ∼5% of the total protein was precipitated by this protocol, and the α/γ complex was stable up to 1.5 mg/ml C12E10, less than 1.5% of the total amount of CHIF could be precipitated by the anti-α antibody, and the yield decreased sharply at increased detergent concentrations. Other experiments have demonstrated that the immunoprecipitation efficiency does not decrease with increasing concentration of the solubilized proteins, suggesting that the amount of antibody is not a limiting factor (data not shown). Based on the above findings one could assume that the efficiency of co-immunoprecipitation is determined by FXYD/α subunit interactions, which are also relevant in the intact membrane. FXYD proteins may interact with β as well as α subunit and be immunoprecipitated by the anti-α antibody because of the tight α/β association. The difference in sensitivity to the detergent has been used to identify domains and residues responsible for the stability of the CHIF/α and γ/α complexes in C12E10. Both CHIF and γ have an extracellular N terminus (e), which in the case of CHIF includes also a signal peptide; a transmembrane segment (m); and an intracellular C terminus (i) (3Beguin P. Wang X.Y.

Physiol. 2001; 280: F505-F515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chimeras in which one of these domains originates from one FXYD protein and the rest of the protein from the other were constructed and transfected in HeLa-α1 cells (Fig. 2A). For four of the six constructs, cell clones expressing the chimeric proteins at levels comparable with those of CHIF and γ in native tissue could be selected (Fig. 2B). As reported previously (5Therien A.G. Karlish S.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), γb was expressed in transfected cells as a doublet (γb and γb′), of which γb′ could be a post-translationally modified product. It is different from the doublet seen in kidney medulla, which reflects expression of γa and γb. A similar doublet (γb and γb′) was apparent in cells expressing γbeγmCi, whereas only a single band appeared in cells transfected with Ceγmγi of CeγmCi. Thus, γb′ may carry a post-translational modification in the external domain of γ. Two chimeras that have the extracellular domain of γ and the trans-membrane segment of CHIF, γeCmCi and γeCmγi, produced little or no protein. The same observation has been made irrespective of the γ splice variant used (γa or γb). Despite the lack of expression of these proteins, the chimeric cDNAs did transcribe mRNA at levels 30–200% of those of the nonchimeric constructs (not shown). Thus, the lack of expression of the protein may reflect inherent instability of these particular structures. The four chimeras that were expressed were tested for co-immunoprecipitation with α and stability of the FXYD/α complex at increasing concentrations of C12E10 (Fig. 3). The key observation is that stability of the different chimera in C12E10 correlates with the origin of their transmembrane domain. Thus, the protein CeγmCi behaved like γ and could be effectively immunoprecipitated (>8%) at 1.5 mg/ml C12E10 (Fig. 3). On the other hand, exchanging the cytoplasmic domains or the N termini between the two FXYD proteins was without effect, i.e. Ceγmγi and γeγmCi behaved as γ, whereas CeCmγi behaved as CHIF. Previous observations indicated that the phospholemman/α complex too is stable at relatively high concentrations of C10E12 (6Crambert G. Fuzesi M. Garty H. Karlish S. Geering K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11476-11481Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). However, replacing the transmembrane domain of CHIF with that of phospholemman (P) did not substantially increase the immunoprecipitation efficiency at 2 mg/ml C12E10, i.e. the anti-α antibody immunoprecipitated 0.4 ± 0.2% (4Therien A.G.

Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4250-4260Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) phospholemman. Thus, there must be factors in addition to the transmembrane segments that are significant for stabilizing the interaction (see “Discussion”). To further analyze the amino acids involved in the FXYD/α interactions, we have mutated different transmembrane residues and examined the consequences for stability of the CHIF/α complex. Initially, multiple mutations of transmembrane CHIF residues to the corresponding γ positions were tested (Fig. 4). The data indicated that mutagenesis can indeed increase immunoprecipitation efficiency at 2 mg/ml C12E10 and abolish the decrease in complex stability upon raising detergent concentration from 0.35 to 2 mg/ml C12E10 (Fig. 4B). Further analysis demonstrated the existence of at least two different residues mediating this effect. One is in the range Gly45–Ile53 and the other in the range Ala54–Ala56 (Fig. 4C). Next, various single and double mutations of transmembrane CHIF residues to the corresponding γ residues were constructed and assayed for immunoprecipitation with α (Fig. 5). Three point mutations were found to independently increase complex stability in C12E10. These are G45A, M55I, and A56L. The double mutant M55I/A56L produced a complex that was significantly more stable than either M55I or A56L alone, suggesting that their effects are not mutually exclusive. CHIF and γ have opposite effects on the apparent affinity of the Na,K-ATPase for cell Na+. Co-expression of CHIF with α increases the affinity for intracellular Na+, whereas γ decreases it (3Beguin P. Wang X.Y. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K.

Therefore, it was of interest to evaluate whether mutations that stabilize the CHIF/α complex also change the functional effects of this protein. Accordingly, effects on the pump kinetics of CHIF, γ, and the two CHIF triple mutants were compared (Fig. 6 and Table I). As expected, CHIF decreased and γ increased K0.5 for Na+ relative to the values measured in cell transfected with empty vector. The triple mutant A54L/M55I/A56L behaved essentially liked CHIF and increased the apparent affinity to Na+ even more than CHIF. Thus, these residues, which include two of the three amino acids that stabilize the CHIF/α complex, are not responsible for the different functional effects of CHIF and γ. Similarly, another triple mutation of residues that varies between CHIF and γ, Q38R/M42L/C49F, was without effect on function.Table IEffects of γ, CHIF, and CHIF with mutations in the trans-memebrane segment on the apparent Na+ affinityOuabain-sensitive 86Rb+ fluxes were measured for different Na+ activities as described under “Experimental Procedures.” K0.5 was calculated by fitting individual experiments to Michaelis-Menten kinetics.

These experiments, summarized in Fig. 7, clearly demonstrated that although the triple mutations described above were without effect, the differences in Na+ affinity conferred by CHIF or γ are governed by the transmembrane domain of these proteins. Thus, chimeras in which the C or N terminus of γ was replaced by the corresponding CHIF sequences (γeγmCi and Ceγmγi) behaved like γ and increased K0.5. Similarly, a CHIF construct in which the C terminus was replaced by that of γ (CeCmγi) behaved like CHIF. On the other hand, a CHIF construct with the trans-membrane domain derived from γ (CeγmCi) increased K0.5, like γ. As described above, the opposite construct (γeCmγi) did not express protein. Protein was expressed, however, if the chimera had, in addition, the triple mutation AMA → LIL. This mutated construct (γeC*mγi) decreased K0.5 like CHIF, although the mutation alone (A54L/M55I/A56L) was without effect. Taken together, the above data indicate that the transmembrane interactions also control the effects of CHIF and γ on the Na+ affinity of the pump, but the interactions involved differ from those shown to control the FXYD/α complex stability. It should be noted that a source of error in these experiments is a variable level of FXYD expression in the transfected cells. Thus, if the FXYD:α stoichiometry is less than 1, the observed change in K0.5 will be less than maximal. Accordingly, the only rigorous conclusion to be drawn from such experiments is whether a particular chimera increases or decreases Na+ affinity. The observed magnitude of the effect could be an underestimation of the true one. FXYD is a newly discovered family of single-span transmembrane proteins with a common extracellular motif (1Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Four members of this group have been shown to interact with the α subunit of the Na,K-ATPase and alter the pump kinetics (3Beguin P. Wang X.Y. Firsov D. Puoti A. Claeys D. Horisberger J.D. Geering K.

Their function would be to adjust the pump kinetics in a specific tissue, cell type, or physiological state, without affecting it elsewhere. CHIF and γ are two epithelial specific members of this family expressed primarily along the kidney nephron or in distal colon (CHIF) (8Garty H. Lindzen M. Scanfano R. Aizman R. Fuzesi M.

Acad. Sci. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). These differences have been used to study their structure-function relationships using chimeras formed between the two proteins, as well as point mutations. The major observation was that both the effect on the Na+ affinity and the stability of the complex in detergent are determined by the transmembrane segment, which is the most conserved region of the seven members of the FXYD protein family. Obviously, this does not exclude important structural and functional roles of the N and C termini. It has been reported that the FXYD sequence in the extracellular domain is itself essential for assembly of CHIF and γ with the pump (7Béguin P. Crambert G. Guennoun S. Garty H. Horisberger J.-D. Geering K. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3993-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, the anti-C-terminal antibody abrogates the effect of γ on ATP affinity but not that on sodium affinity, suggesting the existence of more than one interaction (5Therien A.G. Karlish S.J. Blostein R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12252-12256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). It has been shown recently that both the C-terminal cytoplasmic and N-terminal extracellular sequences of the γ subunit affect the ATP affinity (26Pu H.X. Scanzano R. Blostein R. J. Biol.

One indication for stability of the FXYD/α/β complex in detergent is the efficiency of co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1). Because the soluble complexes preserve both the structural and functional integrity of the native complexes (27Carradus M. Shainskaya A. Barber J. Karlish S.J.D. Excerpta Medica ICS. 2000; 1207: 301-304Google Scholar), we assume that this parameter is also indicative of protein/protein interactions that are relevant in the intact membrane. We found that the normal low stability of the CHIF/α/β complex can be increased by 4–10-fold to values characteristic of γ/α/β or phospholemman/α/β oligomers, by mutating one of three residues to the corresponding amino acids in γ, i.e. G45A, M55I, or A56L. Helical wheel projection indicates that Gly45 and Ala56 face the same direction, whereas Met55 is oriented at an angle of ∼100° (Fig. 5, inset). Thus, the above stabilizing mutations appear to be involved in interactions with two other helices in β and/or α. Interestingly, these residues appear to be well conserved among FXYD proteins species. All of the available CHIF sequences (mouse, rat, and human) have Gly at position 45, but all other FXYD have a well conserved Ala at this position (1Sweadner K.J. Rael E. Genomics. 2000; 68: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Similarly, other FXYD proteins have Ile, Leu, or Val in the positions corresponding to CHIF Met55 and Ala56. The transmembrane domain also appears to govern at least one of the functional effects of CHIF and γ. Exchanging these segments reversed the direction of the change in Na+ affinity, whereas substituting the N- or C-terminal sequences that lie outside the membrane was without effect on this parameter. Thus, intra-membrane interactions also determine at least one of the kinetic effects of these FXYD proteins. However, this functional interaction is different from that determining the stability of the complex because it is not affected by mutating 54AMA into LIL. Three other mutations of nonconserved transmembrane residues (Q38R/M42L/C49F) were also ineffective in altering Na+ affinity. The effect on Na+ affinity must therefore be mediated by other residues or depends on a more complex interaction that requires a specific combination of the above residues. For example it is just conceivable that the 54AMA to LIL mutation decrease KATP and secondarily KNa, thereby mask a γ-like effect on the K+/Na+ antagonism. To detect this kind of complex interaction, expression systems permitting more detailed functional analysis will be required. In conclusion, the present study provides the first systematic analysis of structure-function relations of FXYD proteins and highlights the important functional and structural role of the trans-membrane segment."

Tryptic digestion of soybean Lox-1 is known to produce a 60 kDa fragment, termed “mini-Lox,” which shows enhanced catalytic efficiency and higher membrane-binding ability than the native enzyme (Maccarrone, M., Salucci, M. L., van Zadelhoff, G., Malatesta, F., Veldink, G. Vliegenthart, J. F. G., and Finazzi-Agrò, A. (2001) Biochemistry 40, 6819–6827). In this study, we have investigated the stability of mini-Lox in guanidinium hydrochloride and under high pressure by fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Only a partial unfolding could be obtained at high pressure in the range 1–3000 bar at variance with guanidinium hydrochloride. However, in both cases a reversible denaturation was observed. The denaturation experiments demonstrate that mini-Lox is a rather unstable molecule, which undergoes a two-step unfolding transition at moderately low guanidinium hydrochloride concentration (0–4.5 m). Both chemical- and physical-induced denaturation suggest that mini-Lox is more hydrated than Lox-1, an observation also confirmed by 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) binding studies. We have also investigated the occurrence of substrate-induced changes in the protein tertiary structure by dynamic fluorescence techniques. In particular, eicosatetraynoic acid, an irreversible inhibitor of lipoxygenase, has been used to mimic the effect of substrate binding. We demonstrated that mini-Lox is indeed characterized by much larger conformational changes than those occurring in the native Lox-1 upon binding of eicosatetraynoic acid. Finally, by both activity and fluorescence measurements we have found that 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate has access to the active site of mini-Lox but not to that of intact Lox-1. These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the larger hydration of mini-Lox renders this molecule more flexible, and therefore less stable.

Mammalian Loxs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, psoriasis, and bronchial asthma (1Kühn H. Borngraber S. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 447: 5-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). They are also thought to have a role in atherosclerosis, brain aging, human immunodeficiency virus infection, kidney diseases, and terminal differentiation of keratinocytes, because they are key enzymes in the arachidonate cascade, together with cyclooxygenases (2Funk C.D. Science. 2001; 294: 1871-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (2997) Google Scholar). In plants, lipoxygenases are active in germination, in the synthesis of traumatin and jasmonic acid, and in the response to abiotic stress (3Grechkin A. Prog. Lipid Res. 1998; 37: 317-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Recently, Lox activity has been shown to be instrumental in inducing irreversible damages to organelle membranes (4van Leyen K. Duvoisin R.M. Engelhardt H. Wiedmann M. Nature. 1998; 395: 392-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 5Grullich C. Duvoisin R.M. Wiedmann M. van Leyen K.

Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 776-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The biological activities of Loxs have attracted a growing interest on both their functional and structural properties. Plant and mammalian Loxs are made by a single polypeptide chain folded in a two-domain structure (7Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain is a β-barrel of ∼110–115 (mammals) and 150 (plants) residues, whereas the larger C-terminal domain is mainly helical and contains the catalytic site.Soybean lipoxygenase-1 (Lox-1) is widely used as a prototype for studying the structural and functional properties of lipoxygenases from tissues of different species (7Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Lox-1 has a 30-kDa N-terminal domain and a 60-kDa C-terminal domain containing the catalytically active iron and the substrate-binding pocket. The function of the N-terminal β-barrel domain has been elusive for several years, for Lox-1 as well as for other Loxs (7Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). Recently, the N-terminal domain has been shown to be essential for calcium binding and activation of 5-lipoxygenase activity (8Hammarberg T. Provost P. Persson B. Radmark O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38787-38793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and for nuclear membrane translocation of this Lox isoform (9Chen X.S. Funk C.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 38550-38556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Equilibrium unfolding experiments on Lox-1 have shown that the C-terminal domain is less stable than the N-terminal domain, undergoing chemical denaturation in the early steps of the complex protein unfolding process (11Sudharshan E. Appu Rao A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35351-35358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The smaller N-terminal domain seems to retain a large part of its β-barrel structure even at high urea concentration, suggesting that this portion of the protein structure might be important for the overall protein stability. Limited proteolytic cleavage of Lox-1 into the N- and C-terminal domains, and their subsequent isolation, have added new important structural and functional information (12Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In particular, the electrophoretic, chromatographic, and spectroscopic analyses of the purified 60-kDa C-terminal domain of Lox-1 (termed “mini-Lox”) have shown that the trimmed enzyme is still folded. Surprisingly, mini-Lox was shown to have a greater catalytic activity than intact Lox-1, thus suggesting a built-in inhibitory role for the N-terminal domain (12Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition, mini-Lox displayed a higher binding affinity than Lox-1 for artificial membranes, attributable to the enhanced surface hydrophobicity exposed after removal of the 30-kDa N-terminal fragment. Interestingly, similar results have been recently reported about the effect of the N-terminal domain removal on the activity and membrane-binding ability of the reticulocyte-type 15-lipoxygenase (13Walther M. Anton M. Wiedmann M. Fletterick R. Kühn H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27360-27366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).A three-dimensional representation of mini-Lox can be generated from the Lox-1 crystallographic data (Fig. 1). The high number of trypthophans (12Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) renders this enzyme spectroscopically very complex, as demonstrated by the great heterogeneity of the mini-Lox fluorescence spectrum (12Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). A somewhat greater solvent accessibility of aromatic chromophores of mini-Lox with respect to Lox-1 is apparent probably associated to a conformational change after proteolytic cleavage (12Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar).In our study we have investigated the relationship between the activity of mini-Lox (e.g. enhanced enzymatic activity) and its structural features checked by circular dichroism, 1-anilino-8-naphthalenesulfonate (ANS) binding, steady-state, and dynamic fluorescence. Because the balance between the loss of hydrophobic interactions and the enhanced solvation upon the N-terminal removal is crucial to understand the mini-Lox properties, we have also studied the stability of mini-Lox using complementary techniques, such as chemical equilibrium unfolding measurements and denaturation by hydrostatic pressure. The results demonstrate that the removal of the N-terminal domain makes the mini-Lox more sensitive to denaturation by both guanidinium hydrochloride (GdHCl) and pressure. Furthermore, dynamic fluorescence measurements and ANS binding experiments provide new evidence that the active site is more accessible in the mini-Lox than in the Lox-1 and that quite different conformational changes follow the substrate binding in the two enzymes. All together these results provide a new structural rationale that might explain the peculiar mini-Lox features.CONCLUSIONSThe fact that mini-Lox, the 60-kDa fragment of Lox-1, is more efficient than the whole native protein in both dioxygenase activity and membrane-binding ability (12Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is rather intriguing. In this paper we attempted to figure out which possible correlation holds between biological and structural features of mini-Lox. We have shown that the removal of the 30-kDa fragment from the 90-kDa molecule generates a more hydrated protein, which displays an increased affinity for hydrophobic probes like ANS. Mini-Lox appears to undergo larger conformational changes than Lox-1 upon ETYA and ANS binding, displaying greater sensitivity but also better reversibility after pressure- and GdHCl-induced unfolding. It could be argued that a larger structural flexibility due to the partial loosening of the tertiary structure is the main reason for the enhanced activity. In particular, the possibility of binding ANS in the active site is a direct evidence that mini-Lox gives the substrates an easier access to the hydrophobic cavity, where the catalysis takes place. In this context, the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain of Lox-1 could act as a built-in inhibitor of the enzymatic activity (12Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) takes ground. It seems noteworthy that trypsin-trimmed Lox-1, as well as “reconstituted” Lox-1 obtained by adding the tryptic fragments of molecular mass <60 kDa to mini-Lox, showed the same activity as isolated mini-Lox, suggesting that these <60 kDa fragments had no effect on enzyme activity (12Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This result is at variance with a previous report (49Ramachandran S. Carroll R.T. Dunham W.R. Funk M.O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7700-7706Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an inhibition of mini-Lox by these fragments could be expected, in view of the enhanced activity of the trimmed enzyme compared with the native form. It can be proposed that the lack of effect (either stimulatory or inhibitory) of the <60 kDa fragments on mini-Lox activity simply reflects a different interaction between the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments after proteolysis. In addition, the N-terminal fragment could also make the native enzyme less able to bind hydrophilic molecules, and more selective toward hydrophobic molecules like its natural lipid substrates. By the way soybean Lox-1 is a 15-lipoxygenase (7Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar) and interestingly its mammalian counterpart,i.e. the rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase, has a similar site for trypsin cleavage (50Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 12: 1003-1009Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain generated by a cleavage at this site would have almost the same size (535versus 562 amino acid residues) and an overall structure like mini-Lox (Fig. 9). Furthermore, the C-terminal domain of rabbit 15-lipoxygenase is similar to that of human 5-lipoxygenase (51Hemak J. Gale D. Brock T.G. J. Mol. Model. 2002; 8: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that what was found with mini-Lox might hold true also for mammalian lipoxygenases, and that the trimmed enzymes might play a role in physio(patho)logical conditions, where enhanced lipoxygenase activity and membrane lipoperoxidation have been observed, such as kidney disease in humans (52Maccarrone M. Taccone-Gallucci M. Meloni C. Cococcetta N. Manca di Villahermosa S. Casciani U. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 1991-1996PubMed Google Scholar) and programmed cell death in animals (6Maccarrone M. Melino G. Finazzi-Agrò A.

Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) is rather intriguing. In this paper we attempted to figure out which possible correlation holds between biological and structural features of mini-Lox. We have shown that the removal of the 30-kDa fragment from the 90-kDa molecule generates a more hydrated protein, which displays an increased affinity for hydrophobic probes like ANS. Mini-Lox appears to undergo larger conformational changes than Lox-1 upon ETYA and ANS binding, displaying greater sensitivity but also better reversibility after pressure- and GdHCl-induced unfolding. It could be argued that a larger structural flexibility due to the partial loosening of the tertiary structure is the main reason for the enhanced activity. In particular, the possibility of binding ANS in the active site is a direct evidence that mini-Lox gives the substrates an easier access to the hydrophobic cavity, where the catalysis takes place. In this context, the hypothesis that the N-terminal domain of Lox-1 could act as a built-in inhibitor of the enzymatic activity (12Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) takes ground. It seems noteworthy that trypsin-trimmed Lox-1, as well as “reconstituted” Lox-1 obtained by adding the tryptic fragments of molecular mass <60 kDa to mini-Lox, showed the same activity as isolated mini-Lox, suggesting that these <60 kDa fragments had no effect on enzyme activity (12Maccarrone M. Salucci M.L. van Zadelhoff G. Malatesta F. Veldink G. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Finazzi-Agrò A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6819-6827Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This result is at variance with a previous report (49Ramachandran S. Carroll R.T. Dunham W.R. Funk M.O. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7700-7706Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). On the other hand, an inhibition of mini-Lox by these fragments could be expected, in view of the enhanced activity of the trimmed enzyme compared with the native form. It can be proposed that the lack of effect (either stimulatory or inhibitory) of the <60 kDa fragments on mini-Lox activity simply reflects a different interaction between the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments after proteolysis. In addition, the N-terminal fragment could also make the native enzyme less able to bind hydrophilic molecules, and more selective toward hydrophobic molecules like its natural lipid substrates. By the way soybean Lox-1 is a 15-lipoxygenase (7Brash A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23679-23682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar) and interestingly its mammalian counterpart,i.e. the rabbit reticulocyte 15-lipoxygenase, has a similar site for trypsin cleavage (50Gillmor S.A. Villasenor A. Fletterick R. Sigal E. Browner M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 12: 1003-1009Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain generated by a cleavage at this site would have almost the same size (535versus 562 amino acid residues) and an overall structure like mini-Lox (Fig. 9). Furthermore, the C-terminal domain of rabbit 15-lipoxygenase is similar to that of human 5-lipoxygenase (51Hemak J. Gale D. Brock T.G. J. Mol. Model. 2002; 8: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that what was found with mini-Lox might hold true also for mammalian lipoxygenases, and that the trimmed enzymes might play a role in physio(patho)logical conditions, where enhanced lipoxygenase activity and membrane lipoperoxidation have been observed, such as kidney disease in humans (52Maccarrone M. Taccone-Gallucci M. Meloni C. Cococcetta N. Manca di Villahermosa S. Casciani U. Finazzi-Agrò A. J. Am. Soc.

Recognition of the viral DNA termini by IN is sequence-specific, and that of the host DNA does not require particular sequence, although in physicochemical studies IN fails to discriminate between the two interactions. Here, such discrimination was allowed thanks to a model system using designed oligonucleotides and peptides as binding structures. Spectroscopic (circular dichroism, NMR, and fluorescence anisotropy) techniques and biochemical (enzymatic and filter binding) assays clearly indicated that the amphipathic helix α4, located at the catalytic domain surface, is responsible for the specific high affinity binding of the enzyme to viral DNA. Analogues of the α4 peptide having increased helicity and still bearing the biologically relevant lysines 156 and 159 on the DNA binding face, and oligonucleotides conserving an intact attachment site, are required to achieve high affinity complexes (Kd of 1.5 nm).

If the spreading of HIV (3Barré-Sinoussi F. Chermann J.C. Rey F. Nugeyre M.T. Chamaret S. Gruest J. Dauget C. Axler-Blin C. Vezinet-Brun F. Rouzoux C. Rozenbaum W. Montagnier L.

Even through a small number of vaccines are in clinical tests, none has lived up its early promise (4Nabel G.J. Nature. 2001; 410: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Thus, treatment of AIDS still requires the development of effective inhibitors of HIV replication (5Richman D.D. Nature. 2001; 410: 995-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 6Pommier Y.

New drugs, acting on integrase (IN), would be a valuable complement in this therapy.The IN of HIV is essential for the viral replication (8Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hugghes S.H. Varmus H.E.

IN uses a multistep reaction to integrate a linear DNA copy (cDNA) of the retroviral genome in the host cell DNA (8Brown P.O. Coffin J.M. Hugghes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses.

In the first step, termed 3′ end processing, IN removes two nucleotides from the 3′ terminus of each strand of the viral cDNA. In the second step, the free terminal 3′-hydroxyl groups attack the target-host DNA, and the viral cDNA is integrated by a transesterification reaction into the cell genome (14Engelman A. Mizuuchi K. Craigie R. Cell. 1991; 67: 1211-1221Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar).The HIV-1 enzyme (288 amino acid residues) is organized into an N-terminal domain, a central catalytic domain, or catalytic core, and a C-terminal domain (15Engelman A.

Remarkably, these amino acids lie on the same side of the amphipathic helix α4.The biological relevance of helix α4 has been confirmed by recent studies (6Pommier Y. Marchand C. Neamati N.

For instance, 1-(5-chloroindol-3-yl)-hydroxy-3-(2H-tetrazol-5-yl)-propenone, which is a diketo acid derivative, binds the α4 helix residues Gln-148, Glu-152, Asn-155, Lys-156, and Lys-159 (20Goldgur Y.

Moreover, peptides deriving from helix α4 behave as competitive inhibitors of IN, and this is also true for monospecific antibodies raised against a peptide containing α4 (43Pommier Y. Neamati N. Adv. Virus. Res. 1999; 52: 427-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 44Sourgen F. Maroun R.G. Frere V. Bouziane M. Auclair C. Troalen F. Fermandjian S. Eur. J.

Virus Res. 1999; 52: 371-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Yet, despite this ensemble of data, a clear physicochemical demonstration of the involvement of helix α4 in viral cDNA recognition has not yet been established, undoubtedly because of the absence of crystallographic or NMR information on the DNA-protein complexes. The failure of the spectroscopic methods to discriminate between the high affinity (specific) and the low affinity (nonspecific) binding modes in experiments using the entire enzyme and several DNA substrates does not help to fill this gap (48Engelman A. Hickman A.B. Craigie R. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 5911-5917Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Asante-Appiah E. Skalka A.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 351-369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we carried out a detailed physicochemical study, combining CD, NMR, fluorescence anisotropy, and filter binding assay, aiming to decipher the role of the helix α4 of IN in the cDNA recognition events. The principle of our simplified approach rested on the design of target oligonucleotides and ligand peptides with optimized binding structures. We assumed that, to achieve good binding interactions, the partners would have to have stable secondary structures resembling the secondary structures of their parent segments within the entire cDNA and IN. Actually, our results show that the flexibility and the poor helicity of the synthetic α4 peptide, reproducing the helix α4 sequence, prevent the formation of a high affinity complex with the oligonucleotide target. In contrast, the α4 peptide analogue K156, which presents a higher helix content, generated by appropriate helicogenic mutations in the sequence, and still bears the residues Lys-156 and Lys-159, critical for the cDNA recognition (37Jenkins T.M. Esposito D. Engelman A. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6849-6859Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 38Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10655-10665Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 39Heuer T.S. Brown P.O. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6667-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 40Esposito D. Craigie R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5832-5843Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), expresses a high affinity binding (Kd = 2 nm). For the latter to take place, it further requires oligonucleotide targets with (i) a stable double-helix structure under the low concentration conditions used in fluorescence anisotropy experiments obtained by using hairpin folds (monomolecular structures) instead of linear duplexes (dimolecular structures) and (ii) an intact attachment sequence (att site): AGCAGT3′/5′ACTGCT.All in all, our simplified system demonstrates the utility of employing selected protein and DNA fragments to decipher the mechanisms of interaction of IN with its viral DNA target. Three criteria have proved to be imperative for the occurrence of primary (specific) or high affinity binding: (i) an optimized helical content of the peptide involved in the recognition, this is necessary for a minimal loss of free binding energy during the adjustment to the DNA partner; (ii) conservation of the basic residues Lys-156 and Lys-159 in the optimized peptide structure; and (iii) good stability of the DNA target with integrity of the IN binding locus att.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStructure Predictions—α Helix secondary structure predictions were carried out using the AGADIR and GOR computer programs (50Munoz V. Serrano L. Biopolymers. 1997; 41: 495-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51Garnier J. Gibrat J.F. Robson B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 540-553Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The first method considers short range interactions between residues and provides helicity per residue of peptides lacking tertiary interactions in solution, selecting the pH and temperature values. The second method provides structure predictions more suitable for peptide segments fixed in a tertiary structure i.e. within the protein context. Thus, from the comparison of the AGADIR and GOR predictions one can learn on the influence of the protein surrounding on the helix α4 stability. The AGADIR predictions can also be used for the choice of the mutations improving the helix content in the α4 peptide. Such mutations are needed to generate a peptide secondary structure resembling as much as possible the helix α4 folding in the protein tertiary structure. Maximization of the helical structure is expected to overcome the entropy problems linked to the otherwise large conformational freedom of the peptide in the DNA binding.Peptide Samples—The peptides (see Fig. 2) were synthesized according to the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) procedure on an Applied Biosystems model 432A automatic solid phase synthesizer and were purified by reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography on an Aquapore column using a linear gradient from 0 to 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water. The molecular mass and purity of each peptide was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry on a Platform-quadruple instrument (VG Biotech). Peptide concentrations were determined from the UV signal of Tyr and Trp purposely added at the C terminus, using a molar absorption coefficient at 280 nm equal to 1197 m–1·cm–1 (K156 and E156) and equal to 5600 m–1·cm–1 (E159):Fig. 2Synthetic peptides used in this study. Numbering of residues retains that of the protein sequence. Positions 156 and 159 are underlined. The heptad repeats are indicated as usual by letters from a to g. Most often, positions a and d are hydrophobic.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Protein Samples—The plasmid encoding double mutant IN (IN1–288/F185K/C280S) was kindly provided by R. Craigie (National Institutes of Health). The enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) as described previously (52Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Purification was performed at 4 °C under native conditions without detergent on a His-trap column (Amersham Biosciences) using a zinc chelate. Cells expressing double mutant IN from 250 ml of culture medium were resuspended in 10 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (10 mm imidazole in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl)). The cell suspension was treated with 1 mg/ml lysozyme for 30 min at 4 °C, and bacteria were disrupted using a French press. Lysed cells were centrifuged for 30 min at 10000 × g, and the supernatant was filtered (0.22 μm) and loaded on the column equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with Buffer A plus 10 to 70 mm imidazole, and the protein was eluted with Buffer A plus 400 to 500 mm imidazole. Fractions containing integrase were pooled and dialyzed overnight against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8 m NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μm ZnCl2, and 10% (v/v) glycerol). Concentrations of purified double mutant IN were determined with the Bradford kit (Promega) and by UV absorption using a calculated extinction coefficient of 46542 m–1·cm–1 at 280 nm, based on the amino acid composition. Finally, aliquots of purified enzyme were stored at –80 °C.DNA Samples—The target oligonucleotides were purchased from CYBERGENE ESGS.For fluorescence anisotropy experiments, the fluorescein group grafted to oligonucleotides was used as a reporter (see Fig. 3). Hairpin structures were preferred to linear duplexes for their higher stability at the low concentrations dictated by fluorescence spectroscopy. They contain a three-thymine loop and a 17-bp stem reproducing or deriving from the outermost part of the U5 LTR of HIV-1 cDNA. The fluorescein group was introduced either at the 5′ end or on the central thymine residue, which allows us to assess the impact of the position of the bulky fluorescein on the peptide-DNA interactions. A hexadeca oligonucleotide reproducing the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) sequence was also used to determine the nonspecific interactions with the peptides.Fig. 3Synthetic oligonucleotides selected for fluorescence anisotropy studies. The oligonucleotides bear a fluorescein moiety (F) either at the 5′ extremity (f) or on the central T residue (fm). The oligonucleotides of the LTR34 (long terminal repeat of 34 base-paired residues) series adopt hairpin structures, whereas LTRa and LTRb are single stranded, and CRE is a linear autocomplementary duplex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)For the autointegration assays, we used U5b, 5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT; and U5a, 3′-CACACCTTTTAGAGATCGTCA; and LTR34, 5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCTTTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT (hairpin) as substrate/target DNAs. 15 pmol of U5b and LTR34 were radiolabeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham Biosciences). The T4 kinase was heat-inactivated and then 20 pmol of U5a and NaCl at a final concentration of 0.1 m were added to U5b. Both samples, LTR34 and U5a/U5b were heated to 95 °C for 3 min, and the DNA was then annealed by slow cooling in the case of U5a/U5b and quickly cooled in the case of LTR34. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a Sephadex G-10 column (Amersham Biosciences).Integration Assays—The autointegration reaction was performed using either U5a/U5b or LTR34 in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 6.7, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol. The enzyme was added at a final concentration of 200 nm. Reactions were initiated by addition of the DNA and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. They were stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction, and DNA products were precipitated with ethanol. Samples were dissolved in the loading buffer containing 95% formamide, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and 20 mm EDTA and heated for 3 min at 95 °C. Products were separated on a denaturing (7 m urea) 16 or 20% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE, pH 8, and visualized using a STORM Amersham Biosciences PhosphorImager.NMR Spectroscopy—Proton NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 500-MHz spectrometer and processed with XWIN-NMR and FELIX 97.0 (Accelrys) software running on Silicon Graphics workstations. Samples of 400 μl were prepared with K156 and E156, at 4.5 and 3.2 mm, respectively, diluted in 90% H2O-10% D2O. Solutions were adjusted to pH 5.5 by addition of aliquots of NaOH (1 n). TSP was used as an internal chemical shift reference. Standard two-dimensional NMR experiments were recorded at 10, 20, 30, and 40 °C; NOESY (53Kumar A. Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1981; 95: 1-6Crossref Scopus (2014) Google Scholar) and Clean-TOCSY (54Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1192) Google Scholar) data sets were collected with 2048 real points in t2 and 800 points in t1 using TPPI scheme for quadrature detection in the t1 dimension. The relaxation delay was set to 1.5 s, and the spectral widths were enlarged to 10 ppm. In the NOESY, mixing times were varied from 50 to 300 ms, when Clean-TOCSY were collected with MLEV-17 spin-locking pulse ranging from 80 to 120 ms. Solvent suppression was achieved by applying a WATERGATE pulse sequence (55Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3499) Google Scholar). Spectra were zero-filled (final data matrix in real points: 2048 × 1024) and subjected to sine bell weighting functions in both dimensions before Fourier transformation. The quantification of nuclear Overhauser effect data was achieved by calculating the ratio of number of levels in contour plot spectra between sequential HNi/HNi+1 or Hβi/HNi+1 connectivities and the Hαi/HNi+1 ones, taking into account (averaging) the parts below and above the diagonal of spectra.Fluorescence Anisotropy Measurements—Fluorescence anisotropy (A = (IΠ – I⊥)/(IΠ + 2I⊥)) titration measurements were carried out using a Jobin-Yvon Fluoromax II instrument. Parallel (IΠ) and perpendicular (I⊥) emission components were measured in L-format. The denominator of A is simply the total light that would be observed if no polarizers were used. With the fluorophore fluorescein, the excitation from the xenon lamp (150-watt ozone-free) is observed at 492 (488) nm with a 4-nm slit width and the emission at 516 nm with a 5-nm slit width.The fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides were diluted to the desired concentration in 800 μl of assay buffer (pH 6.0, 40 mm Na/Na2 phosphate, 0.5 mm EDTA). Samples were placed in thermally jacketed 1-cm × 0.5-cm quartz cuvettes, and measurements, at least 10 data points for each titration point, were recorded at 5 °C with an integration time of 5 s. The peptides were stepwise diluted. For each an"
https://openalex.org/W2012861398,"Photosystem I (PS I) is a transmembraneal multisubunit complex that mediates light-induced electron transfer from plactocyanine to ferredoxin. The electron transfer proceeds from an excited chlorophyll a dimer (P700) through a chlorophyll a (A0), a phylloquinone (A1), and a [4Fe-4S] iron-sulfur cluster FX, all located on the core subunits PsaA and PsaB, to iron-sulfur clusters FA and FB, located on subunit PsaC. Earlier, it was attempted to determine the function of FX in the absence of FA/B mainly by chemical dissociation of subunit PsaC. However, not all PsaC subunits could be removed from the PS I preparations by this procedure without partially damaging FX. We therefore removed subunit PsaC by interruption of the psaC2 gene of PS I in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Cells could not grow under photosynthetic conditions when subunit PsaC was deleted, yet the PsaC-deficient mutant cells grew under heterotrophic conditions and assembled the core subunits of PS I in which light-induced electron transfer from P700 to A1 occurred. The photoreduction of FX was largely inhibited, as seen from direct measurement of the extent of electron transfer from A1 to FX. From the crystal structure it can be seen that the removal of subunits PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE in the PsaC-deficient mutant resulted in the braking of salt bridges between these subunits and PsaB and PsaA and the formation of a net of two negative surface charges on PsaA/B. The potential induced on FX by these surface charges is proposed to inhibit electron transport from the quinone. In the complete PS I complex, replacement of a cysteine ligand of FX by serine in site-directed mutation C565S/D566E in subunit PsaB caused an ∼10-fold slow down of electron transfer from the quinone to FX without much affecting the extent of this electron transfer compared with wild type. Based on these and other results, we propose that FX might have a major role in controlling electron transfer through PS I.

It mediates light-induced electron transfer from plastocyanin or cytochrome c553 to ferredoxin (1Chitnis P.R. Nelson N. Bogoras L. Vsil I.K. Photosynthetic Apparatus: Molecular Biology and Operation. Academic Press, New York1991: 177-224Google Scholar, 2Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. Lee C.P. Current Topics in Bioenergetics. Academic Press, New York1991Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria, the complex consists of at least 12 polypeptides, some of which bind light-harvesting chlorophyll molecules. The reaction center core complex is made up of the heterodimeric PsaA and PsaB subunits, containing the primary electron donor P700, which transfers an electron through the sequential carriers A0, A1, and FX. The final acceptors FA and FB are located on another subunit, PsaC. P700 is a chlorophyll a dimer, which undergoes light-induced charge separation. The electron carriers A0, A1, FX, FA, and FB represent a monomeric chlorophyll a, a phylloquinone, and three [4Fe-4S] iron sulfur centers, respectively. The crystalline structure of PS I from Synechococus elongatus resolved to 2.5 Å (3Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar) reveals that 11 transmembranal helices are contributed by each of the heterodimeric core subunits PsaA and PsaB. FX is located in the center of the core heterodimer at the interface of subunit PsaC. FX is bound at this interface to interhelical loops (hi; nomenclature according to Ref. 3Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar) of both subunits PsaA and PsaB. The cysteine residues in the two subunits of the heterodimer, which are in an identical amino acid sequence CDGPGRGGTC (4Fish L.E. Bogorad L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8134-8139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bind the iron-sulfur cluster. The two cysteines, Cys-556 and Cys-565, in PsaB of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 that are analogous to Cys-565 and Cys-574 in S. elongatus, are the ligands of FX. Indeed there was no assembly of PS I when they were modified to histidine or aspartate (5Smart L.B. Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus FX is positioned as an intermediate carrier between the initial electron mediators A0 and A1 and the final electron acceptors of PS I FA and FB. Crystallographic determination of PS I placed FX between A1 and FA with edge to edge distance of 6.8 Å between A1 and FX and 10.1 Å between FX and FA (3Jordan P. Fromme P. Witt H.T. Klukas O. Saenger W. Krauss N. Nature. 2001; 411: 909-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). The midpoint potential of FX/FX– is about –700 mV (6Evans M.C.W. Reeves S.G. Cammack R. FEBS Lett. 1974; 49: 111-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the lowest among the iron-sulfur clusters known in biology. It therefore has the properties required for a carrier that mediates electrons between A1, with an estimated redox potential of –800 to –700 mV (7Setif P. Bottin H. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 2689-2697Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) and FA with –530 mV (8Evans M.C.W. Heathcote P. Biochim. Biophys.

The presence of two kinetic components for the oxidation of A1– may reflect the use two similar but not identical electron transfer branches in PS I (14Guergova-Kuras M. Boudreaux B. Joliot A.

Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Electron transport from A1– through FX to FA and FB appears to be modulated by a variety of environmental factors (for review see Ref. 16Brettel K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 322-373Crossref Scopus (429) Google Scholar). A quantum yield of close to one was determined in the forward electron transport in PS I (17Sun A.S. Sauer K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 234: 399-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), indicating that the light energy conversion in PS I was an extremely efficient process. Only when electron transfer between the carriers is either inefficient or inhibited will charge recombination between intermediate carriers and the primary donor occur. The rate of recombination increases with decreasing distance of the electron carrier from the primary donor and can be used to determine the efficiency of the reduction of a given carrier. The rate of recombination therefore is expected to increase if the electron transfer to FX became less efficient in response to the redox state of FA/B, to the absence of these iron-sulfur clusters, to temperature, and possibly to the subunit interaction in PS I. Thus, at low temperature, the single turnover flash reduction of FX was either partially or totally inhibited (12Setif P. Brettel K.

Acta. 1989; 976: 246-249Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the absence of an extrinsic acceptor, following a single turnover flash the t½ of 45 ms for the reduction of P700+ was assigned to the recombination of P700+ FA/B– (20Hiyama T. Ke B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 147: 99-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). When FA/B were prereduced by dithionite, a recombination t½ of 250 μs was determined (21Sauer K. Mathis P. Acker S. van Best J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 503: 120-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although it was expected that when FA/B were pre-reduced the recombination would occur between P700+ and FX–, spectral analysis of this reaction in cyanobacterial PS I indicated that A1– was the dominant electron donor in this recombination; thus electron transfer from A1– to FX appeared to be largely inhibited under such conditions (19Brettel K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 976: 246-249Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Removal of FA/B by dissociation of subunit PsaC with urea treatment resulted in t½ of 1.2 ms for most of P700+ reduction. In the absence of final iron-sulfur clusters of PS I it was reasonable to attribute the reduction of P700+ to recombination with FX– (22Parrett K.G. Mehari T. Warren P.G. Golbeck J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 973: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 23Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 301-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Indeed under such conditions the rate of electron transfer from A1– to FX was reported to be the same as in untreated PS I (9Luneberg J. Fromme P. Jekow P. Schlodder E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 338: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Yet in PS I lacking PsaC by genetic deletion of the subunit (24Yu J. Smart L.B. Jung Y.S. Golbeck J. McIntosh L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or as a result of mutation in the ligands of FA/B (25Yu J. Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.S. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8032-8039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), only partial reduction of FX was observed. Although electron transfer to FX was not directly measured in these works, a significant part of the total reduction of P700+ proceeded at a rate that was faster than the rate of P700+/FX– recombination. This indicated that complete removal of subunit PsaC, and the iron-sulfur clusters FA and FB partially inhibited forward electron transport from A1– to FX. In this work we report the effect of the interruption of the psaC gene, in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, on electron transport in PS I. The intra- and intersubunit interactions were studied in PS I mutated in a cysteine ligand of FX in PsaB and in psaC– mutants, respectively. PS I was assembled in the absence of subunit PsaC and the associated iron-sulfur clusters FA and FB. Single turnover flash experiments showed that a 10-fold slow down and an inhibition of the forward electron transfer to FX occurred in PS I prepared from the cysteine to serine mutant in psaB and the psaC– mutant, respectively. Based on these and other results, we propose that FX has a major role in controlling electron transfer through PS I. The redox potential of FX is influenced by electronic interaction with FA and FB. Reduction or removal of FA and FB may lower the redox potential of FX and thus block electron transfer from A1– to FX. The inhibition of FX reduction resulted in charge recombination of A1– with P700+. We suggest that this control switch has physiological importance in prevention of photooxidation damage that could result from reduction of oxygen by reduced FX and FA/B. Photooxidation damage to FA/B was shown to happen during selective activation of PS I under high light intensity (26Tjus S.E. Scheller H.V. Andersson B. Moller B.L. Plant Physiol. 2001; 125: 2007-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In Vitro Insertional Inactivation of the psaC2 Gene—Plasmid p61–2.4 containing a 2.26-kb fragment of the psaC2 gene from Synechocystis (GenBankTM accession number D63999) (27Steinmuller K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 20: 997-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was used to construct a vector for inactivation of the psaC2 gene. Plasmid p61–2.4 was a kind gift from Dr. Klaus Steinmuller (Universitat Dusseldorf, Dusseldorf, Germany). A 2-kb Ω fragment from the pHP45Ω plasmid, containing the streptomycin and spectinomycin resistance-conferring gene (28Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene. 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar), was digested with SmaI and subcloned in the filled-in XbaI site of psaC2 gene in p61–2.4 plasmid resulting in plasmid pAC2 (Fig. 1). Synechocystis cells from wild type and mutant C565S/D566E in PsaB (29Zeng M. Sagi I. Evans M.C.W. Nelson N. Carmeli C. Gabar G. Pusztai J. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 643-646Google Scholar) were transformed with the pAC2 plasmid for inactivation of the psaC2 gene, essentially as described (30Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar). After transformation, selections of spectinomycin colonies were carried out under light-adapted heterotrophic growth conditions (5Smart L.B. Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) for PsaC mutants. Single spectinomycin colonies were plated and sequentially transferred in increasing spectinomycin concentrations from 5 to 20 μg/ml, respectively, until full segregation was obtained. Cyanobacterial Strains and Growth Conditions—Synechocystis sp. PCC 680 cells, a glucose-tolerant strain, were grown in BG-11 medium supplemented with 5 mm TES, pH 8.0, and 5 mm glucose at 30 °C (31Rippka R. Deruelles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdman M. Stanier R.Y. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-16Crossref Google Scholar). Mixotrophic cultures were grown in continuous light at photon flux density of 40 μmol·m–2s–1. Heterotrophic cultures were grown in dim light (photon flux density of 2 μmol·m–2s–1) or under light-adapted heterotrophic growth conditions: in complete darkness, except for 10 min of light (photon flux density of 40 μmol·m–2s–1) every 24 h (5Smart L.B. Warren P.V. Golbeck J.H. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1132-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For photoautotrophic growth, cells were grown in the medium without addition of glucose in continuous light (photon flux density of 40 μmol·m–2s–1). PsaB and PsaC mutants were grown in medium supplemented with kanamycin (25 μg/ml) and spectinomycin (20 μg/ml), respectively, under heterotrophic growth conditions. For growth on plates, BG-11 medium was supplemented with 1.5% (w/v) Bacto-agar and 0.3% sodium thiosulfate (32Anderson S.L. McIntosh L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2761-2767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Growth of cells was monitored by measurement of absorption changes at 730 nm. Manipulation of DNA—Most of the techniques for DNA analysis and manipulation used in this study were according to standard procedures (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Synechocystis genomic DNA, used as a template for psaB and psaC2 genes, was extracted essentially as described (30Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (842) Google Scholar) and purified by using a GENECLEAN Kit (BIO 101). DNA sequencing was performed on double-stranded plasmid or was PCR amplified DNA by the dideoxy sequencing method (34Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52251) Google Scholar) with a Sequenase Version 2.0 kit (USB). A GCG program (Wisconsin Package Version 9.1; Genetics Computer Group) was used to design oligonucleotides as primers and analyze DNA sequences. Isolation of Thylakoid Membranes and PS I Complexes—Harvested cells were washed and broken in a French pressure cell at 500 p.s.i., and the thylakoids were isolated. PS I was solubilized by the detergent n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside and purified on DEAE-cellulose columns and on a sucrose gradient as described (35Nechushtai R. Muster P. Binder A. Liveanu V. Nelson N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1179-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting were done as described previously (36Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar, 37Tindall K.R. Kunkel T.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Protein in the membranes was determined after solubilization in 1% SDS as described (38Lowry O.H. Rosenbrough N.L. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentration and P700 chemical oxidation and photooxidation were determined according to published methods (39Arnon D.I. Plant Physiol. 1949; 24: 1-15Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Hiyama T. Ke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 257: 160-171Google Scholar). Determination of Acid-labile Sulfide and Iron in the Photosystem I Complexes—The iron content in iron-sulfur clusters in PS I was determined by an adaptation of an earlier reported method (41Golbeck J.H. Lien S. San Pietro A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 178: 140-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 42Lovenberg W. Buchanan B.B. Rabinowitz J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3899-3913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Acid-labile sulfide was determined by modification of published methods (43King T.E. Morris R.O. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 634-641Crossref Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 44Golbeck J.H. San Pietro A. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 73: 539-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In the modified procedure the amount of acid-labile sulfide was determined after the extraction of chlorophyll and measurement of absorption of the dye at 750 nm in the presence of 4 m KCl. It was found that there is less interference from chlorophyll breakdown products left after extraction, when determination was carried out by measurement of the absorption at 750 nm rather than at 640 nm used in the standard assay. Ferredoxin (molecular mass 6.2 kDa) from Clostridium pasteurianum (45Rabinowitz J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1972; 24: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 46Bertini I. Donaire A. Feinberg B.A. Luchinat C. Piccioli M. Yuan H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 192-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) was used as standard. For each preparation, the mean values of three independent experiments, each in triplicate, were calculated to obtain 95% statistical confidence. The values were normalized on the basis of the chlorophyll content in the samples. Isolation and Reconstitution of the PS I Core Complexes and the Subunits saC, PsaD, and PsaE—Preparation of PS I core and isolation of subunits PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE were carried out essentially according to the methods as described (47Parrett K.G. Mehari T. Golbeck J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 341-352Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 48Mehari T. Parrett K.G. Warren P.G. Golbeck J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 139-148Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PS I was dissociated by treatment with 6.8 m urea for 10–30 min until the P700+ reduction reached t of 1 ms. Following removal of the urea by dialysis, the dissociated peripheral low molecular mass polypeptides PsaC, PsaD, and PsaE were separated from the core by ultrafiltration and concentrated by the same method. Reconstitution of iron-sulfur clusters in PS I core preparation and in the PS I complexes from the PsaC-deficient mutant strains was adapted from the previously reported studies (47Parrett K.G. Mehari T. Golbeck J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1015: 341-352Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 48Mehari T. Parrett K.G. Warren P.G. Golbeck J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1056: 139-148Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Essentially PS I core preparations in the absence or the presence of the isolated small subunits obtained from urea dissociation were suspended in N2-purged solutions 0.5% β–mercaptoethanol to which FeCl3 and Na2S solutions were added and incubated for 12–18 h. The solution was concentrated to near dryness by ultrafiltration, washed twice with a solution containing 0.05% β-mercaptoethanol. The reconstituted PS I complexes were stored at –80 °C in the presence of 15% glycerol. Spectroscopic Measurements—The kinetics of P700+ reduction were measured by monitoring flash-induced transient absorption changes at 700 and 820 nm. Measurements at 820 nm were performed on the set-up as described earlier (49Faller P. Debus R.J. Brettel K. Sugiura M. Rutherford A.W. Boussac A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14368-14373Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In brief, the sample was excited by 532-nm laser flashes of 300-ps duration and an energy of ∼0.7 mJ/cm2. Continuous measuring light from an 820-nm laser diode passed through the sample (path length, 10 mm) and was monitored by a silicon photodiode, amplified, and digitized. The electronic bandwidth of the detection system was usually limited to 20 MHz. Typically, 16 transients were averaged at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. Measurements at 700 nm and measurements at 820 nm on reconstituted samples used a modified flash photolysis setup as described earlier (50Zeng M.T. Gong X.M. Evans M.C. Nelson N. Carmeli C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1556: 254-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), which included a 10-ns flash from a Quantal Nd-YAG laser at 532 nm. A measuring beam was provided by a tungsten-iodide source passed through a monochromator. The absorption changes at 820 and 700 nm were monitored by a photomultiplier, interfaced by Tektronix TDS 520A digitizing oscilloscope, and recorded on a personal computer. The kinetics of A1– oxidation in time scales shorter than 5 μs were measured by monitoring flash-induced transient absorption changes at 380 nm on a set-up similar to the one described earlier (51Brettel K. Leibl W. Liebl U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The sample was excited by 53-nm laser flashes of 300-ps duration and an energy of ∼0.5 mJ/cm2. The measuring light was provided by the relatively flat top of a 50-μs xenon flash and was filtered by a combination of interference and colored glass filters placed in the measuring beam before the sample and in front of the detector (silicon photodiode FND 100Q from EG&G), yielding a spectrum of 8-nm width centered at 380 nm. The detector output to 50 ohms was amplified (30 dB, 500 Hz-1.7 GHz) and recorded by a digitizing oscilloscope (DSA 602A with amplifier plug-in 11A52 from Tektronix). The time resolution of the detection system was 2 ns. The baseline was recorded separately with mechanically blocked excitation flash and subtracted from the transient recorded with excitation. Deviating from previous methodology (51Brettel K. Leibl W. Liebl U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1363: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 52Brettel K. Gabar G. Pusztai J. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1999: 611-614Google Scholar), the sample was contained in a quartz cell of 20-mm width, 30-mm height, and 2-mm path length for the measuring light. This cell was allowed to spread the measuring light on a larger cross-section than previously and to diminish a potential actinic effect of the measuring light. Typically, 2048 transients were averaged at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. The same set-up was used to monitor absorption changes at 430 nm (essentially because of oxidation and re-reduction of P700) under identical conditions of excitation and time resolution. The spectral bandwidth of the measuring light was 3 nm, and only 256 transients were averaged. Absorption changes at 380 nm in a time scale up to 500 μs were recorded essentially as described previously (53Shen G. Antonkine M.L. van der E.A. Vassiliev I.R. Brettel K. Bittl R. Zech S.G. Zhao J. Stehlik D. Bryant D.A. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20355-20366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The excitation energy was ∼0.3 mJ/cm2 in a 300-ps flash at 532 nm. The measuring light from a continuous 100-watt tungsten halogen lamp was filtered as above. A shutter placed in the measuring light beam in front of the sample was opened 3 ms before the excitation flash and closed 5 ms after the flash to diminish exposure of the sample to the measuring light. The time resolution of the detection system was ∼1 μs. The sample was contained in a 10 × 10-mm standard cuvette. 256 transients were averaged at a repetition rate of 2 Hz. For measurements at 380 nm in a 10-ms time scale, the measuring light was continuous. The sample was contained in a quartz cell of 20-mm width, 30-mm height, and 2-mm path length, allowing to spread the measuring light to a larger cross-section and to diminish its actinic effect. The time resolution of the detection system was limited to 5 μs. 512 transients were averaged at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. Unless specified otherwise, samples contained 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, 500 μm DCIP, and PS I complexes as indicated in the figure legends. All spectroscopic measurements were performed at room temperature. Absorption change transients were analyzed by fitting with a multiexponential decay using Marquardt least-squares algorithm programs (KaleidaGraph 3.5 from Synergy Software, Reading, PA, and DECO, kindly provided by P. Sétif, Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Saclay, France). Assembly of PS I in the PsaC-deficient Mutants—The segregated cells of the PsaC-deficient mutants, psaC– and psaC– C565S/D575E, failed to grow either mixotrophically or autotrophically under light intensity of 40 μmol·m–2s–1 but could grow heterotrophically at wild type growth rate under a low light intensity of 2 μmol·m–2s–1. The absorption of the chlorophyll/cell at 440 and 680 nm in the psaC– cells was smaller than in the wild type cells suggesting that photosynthetic complexes were assembled at a reduced level in the mutants. A semi-quantitative evaluation of the assemblies of the PS I complexes in the PsaC-deficient mutants was done by Wester"
https://openalex.org/W1969005410,"Numerous extracellular agonists induce consecutive stimulation of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, Ras and c-Raf1, as the starting point of the intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. Recent data point to a more complex reaction pattern of this simple sequence. This study was aimed at elucidating the activation process of endogenous c-Raf1 in U937 cells. Treatment of permeabilized U937 cells with the nonhydrolyzable nucleotide guanosine 5′-3-<i>O</i>-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS) induced prolonged stimulation of Ras and c-Raf1 activity. Intriguingly, both signaling proteins expressed differential responses toward specific inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3-kinases and tyrosine kinases, which indicates diverse signaling reactions feeding into Ras and cRaf-1. Phosphorylation of c-Raf1 serine 338 by p21-activated kinase has been recently reported to contribute to phosphoinositide 3-kinase-dependent activation of c-Raf1. However, in U937 cells stimulation of c-Raf1 activity by GTPγS did not correlate with p21-activated kinase activity and Ser-338 phosphorylation. Thus Ser-338 phosphorylation appears dispensable for c-Raf1 activation under the conditions used. Together these data deny an essential role for serine 338 phosphorylation in c-Raf1 activation and disclose divergent signaling connections of Ras and c-Raf1 in U937 cells."
https://openalex.org/W2017296153,"Little is known about the physiological functions of heparan sulfates (HSs), which are present in the basal lamina surrounding skeletal muscle fibers. Here, we present a new system in which HS is phenotypically knocked out by endogenous expression of epitope-specific anti-HS antibodies. Single-chain antibodies, containing an immunoglobulin leader peptide, were produced by using various expression systems. Antibodies were detected in the Golgi apparatus, the site of HS biosynthesis. Likewise, the HS-degrading enzyme heparanase was expressed. Endogenous expression of antibodies or heparanase in myoblasts resulted in HS-defective myotubes. Excitability and calcium kinetics of HS-defective myotubes were severely compromised, as determined by analysis of electrically induced calcium spikes via video-speed UV confocal laser scanning microscopy. Phenotypically knocking out of individual HS epitopes resulted in specific effects on excitability and calcium kinetics. These data indicate important roles for HSs in skeletal muscle calcium kinetics."
