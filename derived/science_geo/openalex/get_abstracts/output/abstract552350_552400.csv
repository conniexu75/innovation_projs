https://openalex.org/W2264585211,"Alexander Gusev, Bogdan Pasaniuc and colleagues present a strategy that integrates gene expression measurements with summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies to identify genes whose cis-regulated expression is associated with complex traits. They identify 69 new genes significantly associated with obesity-related traits and illustrate how this approach can provide insights into the genetic basis of complex traits. Many genetic variants influence complex traits by modulating gene expression, thus altering the abundance of one or multiple proteins. Here we introduce a powerful strategy that integrates gene expression measurements with summary association statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify genes whose cis-regulated expression is associated with complex traits. We leverage expression imputation from genetic data to perform a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) to identify significant expression-trait associations. We applied our approaches to expression data from blood and adipose tissue measured in ∼3,000 individuals overall. We imputed gene expression into GWAS data from over 900,000 phenotype measurements to identify 69 new genes significantly associated with obesity-related traits (BMI, lipids and height). Many of these genes are associated with relevant phenotypes in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel. Our results showcase the power of integrating genotype, gene expression and phenotype to gain insights into the genetic basis of complex traits."

The etiology and molecular basis for this 'alternative' treatment-resistant cell state remain incompletely understood. Here, by analyzing whole-exome sequencing data of metastatic biopsies from patients, we observed substantial genomic overlap between castration-resistant tumors that were histologically characterized as prostate adenocarcinomas (CRPC-Adeno) and neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE); analysis of biopsy samples from the same individuals over time points to a model most consistent with divergent clonal evolution. Genome-wide DNA methylation analysis revealed marked epigenetic differences between CRPC-NE tumors and CRPC-Adeno, and also designated samples of CRPC-Adeno with clinical features of AR independence as CRPC-NE, suggesting that epigenetic modifiers may play a role in the induction and/or maintenance of this treatment-resistant state. This study supports the emergence of an alternative, 'AR-indifferent' cell state through divergent clonal evolution as a mechanism of treatment resistance in advanced prostate cancer."

Here, we assessed the impact of these factors on human NSCLC metabolism in vivo using intraoperative (13)C-glucose infusions in nine NSCLC patients to compare metabolism between tumors and benign lung. While enhanced glycolysis and glucose oxidation were common among these tumors, we observed evidence for oxidation of multiple nutrients in each of them, including lactate as a potential carbon source. Moreover, metabolically heterogeneous regions were identified within and between tumors, and surprisingly, our data suggested potential contributions of non-glucose nutrients in well-perfused tumor areas. Our findings not only demonstrate the heterogeneity in tumor metabolism in vivo but also highlight the strong influence of the microenvironment on this feature."

Here, we show that coherent optical excitation of molecular vibrations in the organic conductor K3C60 can induce a non-equilibrium state with the optical properties of a superconductor. A transient gap in the real part of the optical conductivity and a low-frequency divergence of the imaginary part are measured for base temperatures far above equilibrium Tc=20 K. These findings underscore the role of coherent light fields in inducing emergent order."
https://openalex.org/W2271364844,"The high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of a pre-fusion coronavirus spike trimer from mouse hepatitis virus is presented; the structure reveals architectural similarities to paramyxovirus F proteins, suggesting that these fusion proteins may have evolved from a distant common ancestor. Coronaviruses are responsible for respiratory infections worldwide, many of them mild, but also including severe pneumonia and the recent SARS and MERS outbreaks. The entry of coronaviruses into cells is mediated by the virus glycoprotein spike trimer, which contains the receptor-binding domain, as well as membrane fusion domains. Two papers published in this issue of Nature provide high-resolution (4Å) cryo-electron microscopy structures of pre-fusion coronavirus spike trimers. David Veesler and colleagues studied the trimer from murine hepatitis virus; Andrew Ward and colleagues used the human betacoronavirus HKU1, a cause of mild respiratory disease. The structures reveal mechanistic insights into the viral fusion process and architectural similarities to paramyxovirus F proteins, suggesting that these fusion proteins may have evolved from a distant common ancestor. The tremendous pandemic potential of coronaviruses was demonstrated twice in the past few decades by two global outbreaks of deadly pneumonia. Entry of coronaviruses into cells is mediated by the transmembrane spike glycoprotein S, which forms a trimer carrying receptor-binding and membrane fusion functions1. S also contains the principal antigenic determinants and is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Here we present the structure of a mouse coronavirus S trimer ectodomain determined at 4.0 Å resolution by single particle cryo-electron microscopy. It reveals the metastable pre-fusion architecture of S and highlights key interactions stabilizing it. The structure shares a common core with paramyxovirus F proteins2,3, implicating mechanistic similarities and an evolutionary connection between these viral fusion proteins. The accessibility of the highly conserved fusion peptide at the periphery of the trimer indicates potential vaccinology strategies to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies against coronaviruses. Finally, comparison with crystal structures of human coronavirus S domains allows rationalization of the molecular basis for species specificity based on the use of spatially contiguous but distinct domains."

Anxiety is usually an adaptive state of increased apprehension that helps an animal avoid potential danger. However, inappropriate expression of anxiety is maladaptive and, in humans, can lead to anxiety disorders. In order to develop better treatments for these disorders, we must understand the neural circuits that support normal anxiety. Studies in rodents have shown that anxiety-like behavior involves the ventral hippocampus (vHPC), medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and basolateral amygdala (BLA) (Kjelstrup et al., 2002Kjelstrup K.G.

Neurol. 1999; 403: 229-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), suggesting they function as a distributed network that supports anxiety behavior in an interdependent manner. In particular, the direct monosynaptic projection from the vHPC to the mPFC appears to be a key component of this circuit, especially during the expression of innate forms of anxiety-like behavior. In rodents, theta-frequency (4–12 Hz) synchrony emerges between the vHPC and mPFC during exposure to anxiogenic environments such as the elevated plus maze (EPM) (Adhikari et al., 2010Adhikari A.

Synchronized activity between the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex during anxiety.Neuron. 2010; 65: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Moreover, single units in the mPFC that are synchronized with vHPC theta preferentially represent arm-type in the EPM (Adhikari et al., 2011Adhikari A. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A. Single units in the medial prefrontal cortex with anxiety-related firing patterns are preferentially influenced by ventral hippocampal activity.Neuron. 2011; 71: 898-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), suggesting that vHPC input is necessary for this representation. The high degree of interconnectivity in the vHPC-mPFC-BLA circuit and presence of multiple interacting oscillatory activity patterns complicate the picture. Theta-frequency synchrony between the vHPC-BLA and BLA-mPFC is also enhanced during innate forms of anxiety (Lesting et al., 2011Lesting J. Narayanan R.T. Kluge C. Sangha S. Seidenbecher T.

Fear and safety engage competing patterns of theta-gamma coupling in the basolateral amygdala.Neuron. 2014; 83: 919-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), and optogenetic inhibition of the projection from the BLA to the vHPC is anxiolytic (Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013Felix-Ortiz A.C. Beyeler A. Seo C. Leppla C.A. Wildes C.P. Tye K.M. BLA to vHPC inputs modulate anxiety-related behaviors.Neuron. 2013; 79: 658-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). While theta power is increased with anxiety, fast gamma power is decreased, both in the BLA and mPFC (Stujenske et al., 2014Stujenske J.M. Likhtik E. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A. Fear and safety engage competing patterns of theta-gamma coupling in the basolateral amygdala.Neuron. 2014; 83: 919-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Even so, coupling between theta and gamma oscillations within the BLA is enhanced by anxiety (Stujenske et al., 2014Stujenske J.M. Likhtik E. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A. Fear and safety engage competing patterns of theta-gamma coupling in the basolateral amygdala.Neuron. 2014; 83: 919-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Finally, anxiety state modulates the directionality of oscillatory interactions between the mPFC and BLA, such that relative safety is associated with a shift toward enhanced mPFC influence over the BLA in both theta- and gamma-frequency ranges (Likhtik et al., 2014Likhtik E. Stujenske J.M. Topiwala M.A. Harris A.Z. Gordon J.A. Prefrontal entrainment of amygdala activity signals safety in learned fear and innate anxiety.Nat.

These findings emphasize the degree to which each of these three structures functions within an interconnected, interacting circuit. What then might be the role of an individual element within such an interactive circuit? Is the direct vHPC-to-mPFC pathway required for anxiety-like behavior, or might the indirect pathway through the BLA suffice in its absence? And what information does the direct pathway carry? Here we specifically test the role of the direct projection from the vHPC in the expression of anxiety-like behavior, synchrony within vHPC-mPFC-BLA circuit, and the representation of valence in the EPM. Furthermore, we compare unilateral versus bilateral vHPC-mPFC inhibition to distinguish physiological changes that are the direct consequence of the circuit manipulation from those that are secondary to changes in behavioral state. We find that vHPC inputs to the mPFC are required for anxiety-related behavior as well as spatial representations of aversion in mPFC neurons, while facilitating neural synchrony in a frequency- and pathway-specific manner. To examine the role of the direct vHPC-to-mPFC pathway during anxiety-like behavior, vHPC terminals in the mPFC were inhibited using an optogenetic approach. An adeno-associated virus (AAV) carrying either the inhibitory opsin, enhanced Archeorhodopsin 3.0 (Arch), or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) under the control of the CamKIIα promoter was injected bilaterally into the vHPC of wild-type mice (Figure 1A). Optical fibers were implanted in the mPFC, along with microelectrodes in the mPFC, vHPC, and BLA. Seven weeks were allowed for viral expression to achieve maximal opsin levels in vHPC terminals within the mPFC (Figure 1B); we have previously shown that this approach results in at least a 40% reduction in effective neurotransmission in vivo (Spellman et al., 2015Spellman T. Rigotti M. Ahmari S.E. Fusi S. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Hippocampal-prefrontal input supports spatial encoding in working memory.Nature. 2015; 522: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Mice were then tested in the EPM for 8 min, with alternating 2-min periods of no illumination and illumination of the mPFC with green (532 nm) light (Figure 1C). In mice expressing Arch, but not those expressing eYFP alone, bilateral inhibition of vHPC terminals in the mPFC decreased open arm avoidance, as evidenced by both entries into and increased time spent in the open arms (Figure 1C). Bilateral inhibition of vHPC terminals in the mPFC also decreased center avoidance in the open field test (Figure 1D) and decreased latency to eat in the novelty suppression feeding test (Figure 1E), only in the Arch group. Locomotion and velocity were not affected by illumination in either eYFP or Arch mice (Figure S1). To control for the non-specific effects of decreased excitation in the mPFC, Arch was used to inhibit inputs from the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) (Figure S2C). The strength of MD inputs onto mPFC neurons approximates that of vHPC inputs (Little and Carter, 2012Little J.P. Carter A.G. Subcellular synaptic connectivity of layer 2 pyramidal neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex.J. Neurosci. 2012; 32: 12808-12819Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Bilateral inhibition of MD inputs to the mPFC had no effect on open arm avoidance (Figure 1F), suggesting that the behavioral effects of vHPC terminal inhibition are not solely due to a non-specific decrease in excitatory input. The effects of bilateral vHPC-mPFC terminal inhibition on activity and synchrony within the extended vHPC-BLA-mPFC circuit were examined by recording single units in the mPFC and local field potentials (LFPs) in the mPFC, BLA, and vHPC. LFPs predominantly reflect summed synaptic activity within a brain region (Buzsáki et al., 2012Buzsáki G. Anastassiou C.A. Koch C. The origin of extracellular fields and currents–EEG, ECoG, LFP and spikes.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 13: 407-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (2199) Google Scholar). The temporal relationship between spikes and/or LFP activity in one region and LFPs in another can be used as a measure of synchrony (Harris and Gordon, 2015Harris A.Z. Gordon J.A. Long-range neural synchrony in behavior.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 38: 171-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, Siapas et al., 2005Siapas A.G. Lubenov E.V. Wilson M.A. Prefrontal phase locking to hippocampal theta oscillations.Neuron. 2005; 46: 141-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). Terminal inhibition in the EPM decreased synchrony in the theta-frequency range between the vHPC and mPFC, as measured by the strength of phase locking of mPFC spikes to theta oscillations in the vHPC LFP (Figures 2B–2D). Phase locking of mPFC spikes to BLA theta was unaffected by terminal inhibition (Figures 2E–2G), demonstrating pathway specificity of the vHPC terminal inhibition. However, phase-locking to BLA was considerably weaker than to vHPC, allowing for a possible floor effect. Synchrony was further examined using the LFPs recorded from each brain region. Consistent with decreased phase locking of mPFC spikes to vHPC theta, terminal inhibition decreased the correlation of theta power between the mPFC and vHPC (Figures S3A and S3D). This effect was specific to the closed arms of the EPM, consistent with previous reports showing that theta power correlation is higher in the safe compartments of the task (Adhikari et al., 2010Adhikari A. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A. Synchronized activity between the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex during anxiety.Neuron. 2010; 65: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, Likhtik et al., 2014Likhtik E. Stujenske J.M. Topiwala M.A. Harris A.Z. Gordon J.A. Prefrontal entrainment of amygdala activity signals safety in learned fear and innate anxiety.Nat. Neurosci. 2014; 17: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Terminal inhibition had no effect on theta power correlations in a familiar, non-aversive environment (Figure S4B), demonstrating task specificity. The disruption in vHPC-mPFC theta power correlation was also frequency and pathway specific. Inhibiting vHPC terminals did not affect mPFC-vHPC power correlations in the delta (1–4 Hz), beta (13–30 Hz), or slow gamma (30–70 Hz) frequency ranges (Figure S4D). This frequency specificity is consistent with previous reports showing that anxiety does not modulate vHPC-mPFC synchrony in frequency ranges other than theta (Adhikari et al., 2010Adhikari A. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A. Synchronized activity between the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex during anxiety.Neuron. 2010; 65: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). mPFC-BLA theta power correlations were unaffected by vHPC-mPFC terminal inhibition (Figures S3C and S3F). Similarly, there was no overall effect on vHPC-BLA theta power correlations (Figure S3B), though a decrease in theta power correlation could be detected when analysis was restricted to data from the closed arms (Figure S3E). These findings reinforce the pathway specificity of the manipulation. Notably, coherence, a measure of phase synchrony, between LFPs in the vHPC and mPFC was not affected by the manipulation (Figure S4C), consistent with our previous findings that anxiety does not alter coherence (Adhikari et al., 2010Adhikari A. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A. Synchronized activity between the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex during anxiety.Neuron. 2010; 65: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Together, these findings demonstrate that terminal inhibition functionally disconnects the mPFC from the vHPC during anxiety-like behavior, particularly disrupting communication in the theta-frequency range. Interestingly, two measures of local synchrony within the mPFC were increased by terminal inhibition. Both correlated firing of simultaneously recorded mPFC single units (Figure S5A) and phase-locking of mPFC single units to mPFC fast gamma (70–120 Hz) (Figure S5B) were increased by illumination in Arch- but not eYFP-expressing animals. These findings raise the possibility that when decoupled from vHPC inputs, mPFC neuronal spiking synchronizes more strongly with local inputs. To address if vHPC input is necessary for spatial representations of aversion, we turned to unilateral inhibition. Aversion in the EPM is determined by arm-type; the strength of mPFC representations of arm-type varies with avoidance behavior (Adhikari et al., 2011Adhikari A. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A. Single units in the medial prefrontal cortex with anxiety-related firing patterns are preferentially influenced by ventral hippocampal activity.Neuron. 2011; 71: 898-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Therefore, behavioral effects of the bilateral inhibition could confound physiological findings. To eliminate this confound, mPFC single-unit activity was recorded during unilateral inhibition of the vHPC-to-mPFC pathway in an additional cohort. As predicted, unilateral vHPC terminal inhibition did not affect avoidance behavior (Figure 3A). However, unilateral inhibition did disrupt phase locking of mPFC spikes to vHPC theta (Figure 3B) to a similar degree as did bilateral inhibition. Thus, unilateral inhibition successfully separates the physiological and behavioral effects of disrupting the vHPC-mPFC circuit. Unilateral inhibition of vHPC-mPFC inputs abolished the representation of aversion in mPFC single units, as measured by the EPM score, which reflects arm-type selectivity (see Experimental Procedures; Figures 3C–3E). Mean EPM score was decreased regardless of whether the units were significantly phase-locked to vHPC theta or whether they fired preferentially in the open or closed arms (Figure 3F). Terminal illumination in mice expressing eYFP only did not affect EPM scores (Figure 4A). The decrease in arm-type representation was not simply due to a non-specific loss of excitation, since inhibiting the MD-mPFC pathway did not affect EPM scores (Figure 4B). To further examine the contribution of vHPC input toward mPFC unit activity during EPM exploration, firing rates were examined. Each unit was classified as open- or closed-arm preferring, depending on where the firing rate was highest for that unit. Overall firing rates did not change with terminal inhibition for all neurons (Figure 5A) or for putative interneurons or pyramidal neurons (data not shown). However, firing rates in the preferred arm type decreased with vHPC inhibition for both open- and closed-preferring units (Figures 5B–5G), suggesting that the net effect of vHPC input is excitatory. These findings suggest that direct vHPC inputs provide patterned excitation that is required for mPFC spatial representations of aversiveness in the EPM. However, mPFC neurons can represent task-relevant information in a variety of tasks. To determine whether vHPC input is important for mPFC representations of a similar, but non-aversive context, a modified neutral plus maze was created. In this maze, all four arms were fully enclosed, and the two types of arms were marked by different visual patterns (see Experimental Procedures). An additional cohort of mice were implanted and recorded during exploration of this neutral maze. Mice did not display a preference for either arm type (58% ± 12% and 42% ± 12% time spent in each arm type, respectively; p = 0.40). mPFC units only weakly represented arm-type in this neutral maze compared to the the EPM (Figures 6A and 6B ). Moreover, the EPM scores in the neutral maze were not statistically different from EPM scores generated from shuffled spikes (Figure 6C), suggesting that mPFC representations of arm-type in this neutral maze are minimal. Even so, inhibition of the vHPC-to-mPFC pathway decreased the mean EPM scores significantly (Figures 6D–6F). The effects of terminal inhibition on arm-type representations in the neutral maze were small. Nonetheless, they raise the question of whether inhibition of vHPC input to the mPFC alters the anxiety state of the animal or simply disrupts spatial information without affecting valence. To address this issue, we compared additional behavioral and physiological markers of anxiety state across the unilateral and the bilateral terminal inhibition experiments. Behaviorally, we examined head dips in the open arms and the duration of open arm visits. The number of head dips over the open arm edge is associated with anxiety behavior in the EPM (Rodgers and Johnson, 1995Rodgers R.J. Johnson N.J. Factor analysis of spatiotemporal and ethological measures in the murine elevated plus-maze test of anxiety.Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. 1995; 52: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if spatial representations alone were disrupted, without altering anxiety per se, the mice would continue to avoid head dips and make rapid exits from the open arms, despite bilateral inhibition of the vHPC-mPFC pathway. However, bilateral inhibition of the vHPC-mPFC pathway increased both the total number of head dips and the frequency of head dips per unit time spent in the open arms; unilateral inhibition had no effect on these measures, as expected (Figure 7A). Similarly, bilateral, but not unilateral, inhibition increased the duration of open arm visits (Figure 7B). Terminal illumination in eYFP-expressing mice had no effect on either behavior. These findings suggest that with bilateral (but not unilateral) terminal inhibition, mice fail to treat the open arms as aversive. Physiologically, we took advantage of previously established markers of anxiety in the amygdala and mPFC LFPs. Fear conditioning and open field exposure induce characteristic patterns of neural activity in the BLA and mPFC (Lesting et al., 2011Lesting J. Narayanan R.T. Kluge C. Sangha S. Seidenbecher T.

Fear and safety engage competing patterns of theta-gamma coupling in the basolateral amygdala.Neuron. 2014; 83: 919-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Specifically, in addition to the increased theta activity and synchrony discussed above, the strength (power) of fast gamma-frequency (70–120 Hz) oscillations in the BLA and mPFC decrease during anxiety and increase during relative safety (Stujenske et al., 2014Stujenske J.M.

Within the BLA, the strength of the relationship between theta- and gamma-frequency oscillations is increased with anxiety and decreased with relative safety (Stujenske et al., 2014Stujenske J.M.

Accordingly, exposure to the EPM decreased fast gamma power and increased theta-gamma coupling compared to a baseline safe condition (Figure S6). If inhibition of the vHPC-mPFC pathway is truly anxiolytic, we would expect that bilateral inhibition would reduce these physiological markers of anxiety. Indeed, bilateral terminal inhibition mimicked the effects of relative safety on each of these parameters. Bilateral inhibition increased the strength of gamma oscillations in the BLA and mPFC (Figure 7C), inducing a shift in the directionality of gamma synchrony toward increased mPFC lead (Figure 7D). Bilateral inhibition also reduced the strength of coupling between theta and gamma oscillations within the BLA (Figure 7E). Unilateral inhibition, however, did not alter any of these parameters in the inhibited hemisphere (Figures 7F–7H), nor did illumination in YFP-expressing mice (Figure S7). The unilateral inhibition experiments are particularly important for evaluating the physiological markers, as they allow one to distinguish between direct effects of the manipulation on the circuit and indirect effects of the behavioral changes induced by the manipulation. If BLA and mPFC gamma alterations were directly caused by inhibiting vHPC input to the mPFC, then unilateral inhibition would have altered these parameters in the absence of changes in behavior. The lack of effect of unilateral inhibition demonstrates that BLA and mPFC gamma strength, mPFC-to-BLA gamma directionality, and BLA theta-gamma coupling reflect the behavioral state of the animal and not simply decreased vHPC-mPFC input. These behavioral and physiological findings support the notion that bilateral inhibition of vHPC-mPFC terminals alters the anxiety state of the animal, rather than simply altering arm-type selection. The findings described here demonstrate that the direct vHPC-to-mPFC pathway is necessary for anxiety-related behavior, vHPC-mPFC theta synchrony, and spatial representations of aversion in the mPFC. Intriguingly, this inhibition resulted in frequency-specific and pathway-specific effects. Moreover, though vHPC input is required for both anxiety-related and valence-free representations in the mPFC, both behavioral and physiological evidence suggest decreases in anxiety with terminal inhibition. Together, these findings suggest a model in which behaviorally relevant contextual information from the vHPC is sent to the mPFC and utilized to guide avoidance behavior; theta-frequency synchrony appears to be important for this process. The implications of these findings, particularly in terms of the extended BLA-vHPC-mPFC circuit, are discussed below. The BLA, vHPC, and mPFC comprise a tripartite circuit in which each element is important for anxiety-like behavior. Silencing or lesioning any of these three structures alters avoidance behavior in tests such as the EPM (Jinks and McGregor, 1997Jinks A.L. McGregor I.S.

However, these structures are intimately interconnected (Hoover and Vertes, 2007Hoover W.B. Vertes R.P.

Thus, manipulations of any one structure could alter activity patterns in any other within the circuit; the specificity of such manipulations is questionable. Here we attempt to address this caveat by recording simultaneously from the three structures. Inhibition of the vHPC terminals within the mPFC was relatively specific, disrupting synchrony in the theta frequency range between the vHPC and the mPFC with minimal effects on theta synchrony between the BLA and either structure. Importantly, phase-locking of mPFC units to vHPC theta was reduced in both unilateral and bilateral silencing experiments, demonstrating that reduced theta synchrony is a primary effect of inhibiting vHPC input. By contrast, only bilateral inhibition had effects on BLA and mPFC gamma strength and synchrony, suggesting that these measures may be readouts of the anxiety state rather than being causally involved in generating it. The effects of terminal inhibition on vHPC-mPFC interactions were remarkably specific. Theta- synchrony was unaffected in a familiar, non-aversive environment, arguing that vHPC input is required for the increase in synchrony seen in the EPM; indeed, terminal inhibition completely wipes out the fold increase in power correlation from the familiar environment to the EPM (compare Figure S4B to Figure S3). The effects on LFP synchrony were confined to the closed arms, consistent with our prior findings (Adhikari et al., 2010Adhikari A. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A. Synchronized activity between the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex during anxiety.Neuron. 2010; 65: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), suggesting that vHPC-mPFC interactions are particularly engaged during periods of active inhibition of exploration. We also found deficits in LFP synchrony were limited to effects on power correlations, without any effects on coherence. While consistent with prior findings that coherence is unaffected by anxiety (Adhikari et al., 2010Adhikari A. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A. Synchronized activity between the ventral hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex during anxiety.Neuron. 2010; 65: 257-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), the different effects on these two measures caution against simplistic interpretations based on measures of synchrony that rely solely on LFPs. The phase-locking data presented here are therefore particularly important in demonstrating effective disruption of connectivity. Inhibition of the direct vHPC input ablated the representation of aversive and non-aversive context within the mPFC. This result is consistent with recent findings during a working memory task, in which the representation of goal location was disrupted by the same manipulation (Spellman et al., 2015Spellman T. Rigotti M. Ahmari S.E. Fusi S. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Hippocampal-prefrontal input supports spatial encoding in working memory.Nature. 2015; 522: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, mPFC units encode valence; neurons that fire in response to bright, enclosed arms also fire in response to open arms in the dark (Adhikari et al., 2011Adhikari A. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A. Single units in the medial prefrontal cortex with anxiety-related firing patterns are preferentially influenced by ventral hippocampal activity.Neuron. 2011; 71: 898-910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Moreover, terminal inhibition altered additional behavioral measures of valence, independent of arm choice, suggesting that vHPC inputs are crucial not just for spatial representations but also for the anxiety valence. Whether this valence is constructed in the mPFC with the help of vHPC input or is present in the vHPC itself is unclear. A recent report demonstrates that mPFC-projecting vHPC neurons preferentially encode arm type in the EPM, while very few have well-defined place fields (Ciocchi et al., 2015Ciocchi S. Passecker J. Malagon-Vina H. Mikus N. Klausberger T. Brain computation. Selective information routing by ventral hippocampal CA1 projection neurons.Science. 2015; 348: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Evidence from human hippocampal imaging suggests that the anterior hippocampus (the human homolog of the vHPC) responds to negative valence (Gerdes et al., 2010Gerdes A.B.M. Wieser M.J. Mühlberger A. Weyers P. Alpers G.W. Plichta M.M. Breuer F. Pauli P. Brain Activations to Emotional Pictures are Differentially Associated with Valence and Arousal Ratings.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2010; 4: 175Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, Sterpenich et al., 2014Sterpenich V. Schwartz S. Maquet P. Desseilles M. Ability to maintain internal arousal and motivation modulates brain responses to emotions.PLoS ONE. 2014; 9: e112999Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the possibility that vHPC inputs indeed convey valence information to the mPFC. Where might the vHPC get information about valence? It could come from the BLA, given the demonstration that optogenetic inhibition of BLA terminals within the vHPC also disrupts anxiety-like avoidance behavior (Felix-Ortiz et al., 2013Felix-Ortiz A.C. Beyeler A. Seo C. Leppla C.A. Wildes C.P. Tye K.M. BLA to vHPC inputs modulate anxiety-related behaviors.Neuron. 2013; 79: 658-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In addition to innate forms of anxiety, such as those tested in the EPM, learned fear also engages the vHPC-mPFC circuit. In learned fear paradigms, silencing the vHPC, similar to the BLA, disrupts both the expression (during fear recall) and suppression (during extinction recall) of fear (Maren and Holt, 2004Maren S. Holt W.G. Hippocampus and Pavlovian fear conditioning in rats: muscimol infusions into the ventral, but not dorsal, hippocampus impair the acquisition of conditional freezing to an auditory conditional stimulus.Behav. Neurosci. 2004; 118: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, Sierra-Mercado et al., 2011Sierra-Mercado D. Padilla-Coreano N. Quirk G.J.

These reports suggest that the role of the vHPC during learned fear may be more complex than during innate anxiety. Similarly, the influence of vHPC input on mPFC unit activity may differ with the behavioral paradigm used. Silencing the vHPC during learned fear recall results in increased mPFC single-unit responses to the conditioned stimulus (Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012Sotres-Bayon F. Sierra-Mercado D. Pardilla-Delgado E. Quirk G.J. Gating of fear in prelimbic cortex by hippocampal and amygdala inputs.Neuron. 2012; 76: 804-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), suggesting an inhibitory role for the vHPC projection. Here, inhibiting vHPC input resulted in decreased neuronal activity within a neuron’s preferred arm, suggesting an excitatory role (Figure 5). These opposite results may be due to differences in experimental methods—Sotres-Bayon et al., 2012Sotres-Bayon F. Sierra-Mercado D. Pardilla-Delgado E. Quirk G.J. Gating of fear in prelimbic cortex by hippocampal and amygdala inputs.Neuron. 2012; 76: 804-812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar used muscimol in the vHPC, which silences all projections, while here only those projections to the mPFC are inhibited. Alternatively, they may be genuine, task-related differences between learned and innate forms of anxiety. At least for innate anxiety, as demonstrated here, it does appear that the predominant effects of vHPC input are excitatory and, in particular, that this excitation boosts firing rates specifically in each neuron’s preferred arm. This data are consistent with findings during a spatial working memory task, which indicate that inhibiting vHPC terminals eliminates the boost in firing that occurs in mPFC neurons in their preferred goal locations (Spellman et al., 2015Spellman T. Rigotti M. Ahmari S.E. Fusi S. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Hippocampal-prefrontal input supports spatial encoding in working memory.Nature. 2015; 522: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). A long literature links theta-frequency synchrony between the vHPC, mPFC, and BLA to both learned fear and innate anxiety (Adhikari et al., 2011Adhikari A. Topiwala M.A. Gordon J.A.

Fear and safety engage competing patterns of theta-gamma coupling in the basolateral amygdala.Neuron. 2014; 83: 919-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Indeed, directly manipulating theta-frequency oscillations within the mPFC induces freezing, suggesting a causal relationship between theta and fear (Courtin et al., 2014Courtin J. Chaudun F.

Here, inhibition of the vHPC-to-mPFC pathway decreased avoidance behavior and disrupted theta-frequency synchrony between the two structures without affecting synchrony at other frequencies. This specificity is consistent with the frequency-specific increases in synchrony seen during anxiety (Lesting et al., 2011Lesting J. Narayanan R.T. Kluge C. Sangha S. Seidenbecher T. Pape H.-C.

Fear and safety engage competing patterns of theta-gamma coupling in the basolateral amygdala.Neuron. 2014; 83: 919-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Interestingly, inhibition of this same vHPC-to-mPFC pathway during a working memory task had no effect on theta-frequency synchrony (Spellman et al., 2015Spellman T. Rigotti M. Ahmari S.E. Fusi S. Gogos J.A. Gordon J.A. Hippocampal-prefrontal input supports spatial encoding in working memory.Nature. 2015; 522: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar); instead, low gamma (30–70 Hz) synchrony was specifically disrupted. These contrasting findings demonstrate the surprising result that a specific anatomical pathway can mediate synchrony at different frequencies depending on behavioral state. They further suggest the exciting proposition that disrupting theta-frequency communication in this pathway could have anxiolytic effects without impairing hippocampal-prefrontal-dependent cognition."
https://openalex.org/W2259239391,"Dopamine neurons are thought to signal reward prediction error, or the difference between actual and predicted reward. How dopamine neurons jointly encode this information, however, remains unclear. One possibility is that different neurons specialize in different aspects of prediction error; another is that each neuron calculates prediction error in the same way. We recorded from optogenetically identified dopamine neurons in the lateral ventral tegmental area (VTA) while mice performed classical conditioning tasks. Our tasks allowed us to determine the full prediction error functions of dopamine neurons and compare them to each other. We found marked homogeneity among individual dopamine neurons: their responses to both unexpected and expected rewards followed the same function, just scaled up or down. As a result, we were able to describe both individual and population responses using just two parameters. Such uniformity ensures robust information coding, allowing each dopamine neuron to contribute fully to the prediction error signal."
https://openalex.org/W2253271165,"Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) typically exhibit ""primed"" pluripotency, analogous to stem cells derived from the mouse post-implantation epiblast. This has led to a search for growth conditions that support self-renewal of hESCs akin to hypomethylated naive epiblast cells in human pre-implantation embryos. We have discovered that reverting primed hESCs to a hypomethylated naive state or deriving a new hESC line under naive conditions results in the establishment of Stage Specific Embryonic Antigen 4 (SSEA4)-negative hESC lines with a transcriptional program resembling the human pre-implantation epiblast. In contrast, we discovered that the methylome of naive hESCs in vitro is distinct from that of the human epiblast in vivo with loss of DNA methylation at primary imprints and a lost ""memory"" of the methylation state of the human oocyte. This failure to recover the naive epiblast methylation landscape appears to be a consistent feature of self-renewing hypomethylated naive hESCs in vitro."

Here, we show that transcription-dependent targeting results in a sharp increase of viral genomes in the host cell when the target is located in a late-expressed phage gene. In this targeting condition, mutations in the active sites of the type III-A RNases Csm3 and Csm6 lead to the accumulation of the target phage mRNA and abrogate immunity. Csm6 is also required to provide defense in the presence of mutated phage targets, when DNA cleavage efficiency is reduced.

These findings appear relevant to several pathogens that prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion by targeting lipid microdomains on phagosomes. Microtubule motors of the kinesin and dynein families drive many cellular processes such as organelle transport, chromosome segregation, and beating of cilia/flagella. This diversity of function requires the cellular localization and activity of motors to be regulated in many ways (Vale, 2003Vale R.D. The molecular motor toolbox for intracellular transport.Cell. 2003; 112: 467-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1513) Google Scholar). Regulation of motors at the single-molecule level by motor-associated regulatory proteins has been studied extensively (Vallee et al., 2012Vallee R.B. McKenney R.J. Ori-McKenney K.M. Multiple modes of cytoplasmic dynein regulation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, Verhey and Hammond, 2009Verhey K.J. Hammond J.W. Traffic control: regulation of kinesin motors.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 765-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). However, most cellular functions require large forces that can only be generated collectively by a team of many motors (Mallik et al., 2013Mallik R. Rai A.K. Barak P. Rai A. Kunwar A. Teamwork in microtubule motors.Trends Cell Biol. 2013; 23: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Little is known about how such motor teams are assembled at appropriate cellular locations before they can execute a specific task. The substrate on which motor teams must assemble inside cells is usually a lipid membrane, for example, the bilayer membrane covering vesicular cargoes that are transported by motors. We therefore wondered if motor recruitment to a lipid membrane can be controlled by the membrane itself, perhaps in coordination with other membrane-bound proteins that regulate vesicle trafficking (e.g., Rab GTPases). In this respect, the heterogeneity of biological membranes is of particular interest. Cholesterol and sphingolipids appear enriched within lipid microdomains (also known as lipid rafts), where they enhance membrane packing to promote microdomain formation (Mayor and Rao, 2004Mayor S. Rao M. Rafts: scale-dependent, active lipid organization at the cell surface.Traffic. 2004; 5: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, Rao and Mayor, 2014Rao M. Mayor S.

Functional rafts in cell membranes.Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8111) Google Scholar). This process is likely facilitated by a combination of protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions, because microdomains are enriched in specific proteins (e.g., glycosylphosphatidylinositol [GPI]-anchored proteins) and may be maintained by active processes that drive the membrane away from thermodynamic equilibrium (Rao and Mayor, 2014Rao M. Mayor S. Active organization of membrane constituents in living cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2014; 29: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Motors could be localized to microdomains by direct binding to lipids (Klopfenstein et al., 2002Klopfenstein D.R. Tomishige M. Stuurman N. Vale R.D.

Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Membranous regions of high motor density could potentially be created by clustering many copies of a motor within a microdomain. Such geometrical clustering may be of advantage if multiple motors are to work cooperatively as a team (Mallik et al., 2013Mallik R. Rai A.K. Barak P. Rai A. Kunwar A. Teamwork in microtubule motors.Trends Cell Biol. 2013; 23: 575-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, Rai et al., 2013Rai A.K. Rai A. Ramaiya A.J. Jha R. Mallik R. Molecular adaptations allow dynein to generate large collective forces inside cells.Cell. 2013; 152: 172-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Geometrical arguments suggest that motor clustering is necessary for efficient transport of micron-sized cargoes (Erickson et al., 2011Erickson R.P. Jia Z. Gross S.P. Yu C.C.

Indeed, cooperative improvement in transport of artificial liposomes through clustering-induced dimerization of kinesin-3 motors has been reported (Klopfenstein et al., 2002Klopfenstein D.R.

A minus-end-directed kinesin is also shown to localize into membrane domains near the apical subplasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells (Noda et al., 2001Noda Y. Okada Y. Saito N. Setou M.

In this context, the appearance of microdomains on phagosomes with maturation is particularly interesting (Dermine et al., 2001Dermine J.F. Duclos S. Garin J. St-Louis F. Rea S. Parton R.G.

Phagocytosis and subsequent encapsulation of microbes into a membranous vesicle result in the formation of a phagosome. Phagosome maturation is intimately connected to microtubule (MT) motor-driven motion. Early phagosomes (EPs) move in a bidirectional (back-and-forth) manner on MTs, when they physically interact with and exchange lipids and proteins with endosomes (Blocker et al., 1997Blocker A. Severin F.F. Burkhardt J.K. Bingham J.B. Yu H. Olivo J.C. Schroer T.A. Hyman A.A. Griffiths G. Molecular requirements for bi-directional movement of phagosomes along microtubules.J.

J. 2002; 366: 689-704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Intriguingly, this motion changes as the phagosome matures, so that late phagosomes (LPs) exhibit rapid unidirectional dynein-driven transport toward the MT minus end. The mechanism of this change is important to understand because it facilitates fusion of phagosomes with perinuclear lysosomes and is essential for pathogen clearance. MT depolymerization blocks delivery of fluid phase markers from endosomes to phagosomes and also reduces phagosome-lysosome fusion (Blocker et al., 1996Blocker A. Severin F.F. Habermann A. Hyman A.A.

Biol. 2003; 23: 6494-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Importantly, pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Sun et al., 2007Sun J. Deghmane A.E. Soualhine H. Hong T. Bucci C. Solodkin A. Hmama Z. Mycobacterium bovis BCG disrupts the interaction of Rab7 with RILP contributing to inhibition of phagosome maturation.J. Leukoc.

Salmonella impairs RILP recruitment to Rab7 during maturation of invasion vacuoles.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 3146-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) specifically inhibit this switch to dynein-dependent transport as a survival strategy. We therefore wondered if microdomains on the phagosome membrane could upregulate dynein-driven transport of phagosomes. Cholesterol appears to be a major player in microdomain formation on cellular membranes (Mayor and Rao, 2004Mayor S. Rao M. Rafts: scale-dependent, active lipid organization at the cell surface.Traffic. 2004; 5: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, Rao and Mayor, 2014Rao M. Mayor S.

Functional rafts in cell membranes.Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8111) Google Scholar). Dynein-driven transport of endosomes increases in cholesterol storage disorders like Niemann-Pick disease, where cholesterol-laden “paralyzed” endosomes cluster around the MT minus ends (Lebrand et al., 2002Lebrand C. Corti M. Goodson H. Cosson P. Cavalli V. Mayran N. Fauré J. Gruenberg J. Late endosome motility depends on lipids via the small GTPase Rab7.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1289-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Cholesterol accumulation into endolysosomes results in cholesterol-poor phagosomes that are unable to fuse with lysosomes (Huynh et al., 2008Huynh K.K. Gershenzon E. Grinstein S. Cholesterol accumulation by macrophages impairs phagosome maturation.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35745-35755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the GTPase Rab7 that recruits dynein to phagosomes interacts with the cholesterol sensor ORP1L (Rocha et al., 2009Rocha N. Kuijl C. van der Kant R. Janssen L. Houben D. Janssen H. Zwart W. Neefjes J. Cholesterol sensor ORP1L contacts the ER protein VAP to control Rab7-RILP-p150 Glued and late endosome positioning.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 1209-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and is enriched in a cholesterol-rich detergent resistant fraction of phagosomal membranes (Goyette et al., 2012Goyette G. Boulais J. Carruthers N.J. Landry C.R. Jutras I. Duclos S. Dermine J.F. Michnick S.W. LaBoissière S. Lajoie G. et al.Proteomic characterization of phagosomal membrane microdomains during phagolysosome biogenesis and evolution.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2012; 11: 1365-1377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Taken together, the above observations suggest a molecular connection between dynein, Rab7, and cholesterol within microdomains on the phagosome membrane. Here, we show using multiple experimental approaches that dynein clusters into microdomains on the membrane of a phagosome as it matures inside cells. This geometrical clustering allows many dyneins to simultaneously contact a single MT and generate large cooperative force. This force drives rapid retrograde transport of late phagosomes (LPs), likely enabling their fusion with degradative lysosomes. We also show that lipophosphoglycan, the main molecule used by pathogenic Leishmania donovani parasites to survive inside macrophages, specifically disrupts the clustering of dynein on LP membranes to block retrograde transport of LPs. We used phagocytosed beads (latex or silica) to understand how motor-driven transport and phagosome maturation impact each other. Phagocytosed beads undergo biogenesis inside cells to acquire a bilayer lipid membrane (Desjardins and Griffiths, 2003Desjardins M. Griffiths G. Phagocytosis: latex leads the way.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Motor and non-motor proteins assemble in situ on this membrane to drive vigorous transport of these “latex bead phagosomes” (henceforth referred to as phagosomes) along MTs (Blocker et al., 1997Blocker A. Severin F.F. Burkhardt J.K. Bingham J.B. Yu H. Olivo J.C. Schroer T.A. Hyman A.A. Griffiths G. Molecular requirements for bi-directional movement of phagosomes along microtubules.J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 113-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, Rai et al., 2013Rai A.K. Rai A. Ramaiya A.J. Jha R. Mallik R. Molecular adaptations allow dynein to generate large collective forces inside cells.Cell. 2013; 152: 172-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Motion at defined stages of maturation can be assayed using a pulse-chase strategy that allows phagosomes to mature for specific chase periods after ingestion. Proteomic and biochemical studies have extensively used latex bead phagosomes to understand phagosome biology (Desjardins and Griffiths, 2003Desjardins M. Griffiths G. Phagocytosis: latex leads the way.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 498-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, Desjardins et al., 1994Desjardins M. Huber L.A. Parton R.G. Griffiths G. Biogenesis of phagolysosomes proceeds through a sequential series of interactions with the endocytic apparatus.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). These refractile and spherical phagosomes are also ideal for optical trapping to measure forces generated by motors (Rai et al., 2013Rai A.K. Rai A. Ramaiya A.J. Jha R. Mallik R. Molecular adaptations allow dynein to generate large collective forces inside cells.Cell. 2013; 152: 172-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Beads were phagocytosed into J774 mouse macrophages (Rai et al., 2013Rai A.K. Rai A. Ramaiya A.J. Jha R. Mallik R. Molecular adaptations allow dynein to generate large collective forces inside cells.Cell. 2013; 152: 172-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) or into Dictyostelium discoideum cells. The beads were chased inside Dictyostelium cells for 5–10 min to investigate early phagosome (EP) motion and for >30 min to investigate LP motion (Barak et al., 2014Barak P. Rai A. Dubey A.K. Rai P. Mallik R. Reconstitution of microtubule-dependent organelle transport.Methods Enzymol. 2014; 540: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). EPs moved in bidirectional manner inside agar-flattened Dictyostelium cells (Figure 1A; Movie S1). For EPs, fast unidirectional segments of motion were interrupted by pauses followed by reversal and rapid unidirectional motion in opposite direction. In contrast, LP motion was largely uninterrupted and unidirectional (Figure 1A). Many LPs appeared to move smoothly inside cells over distances longer than apparent from Figure 1A, but the convoluted trajectories prevented reliable characterization of motion. Figure 1A also shows representative tracks of endosomes inside Dictyostelium cells. These endosomes do not have beads inside them but are highly motile endogenous vesicles at various stages of maturation. The motion of EPs was very similar to the bidirectional motion of endosomes, but the motion of LPs resembled that of unidirectional endosomes. The velocity of motile EPs within fast unidirectional segments was similar to unidirectional velocity of LPs and endosomes (Figure 1C). The bidirectional (EP) and unidirectional (LP) motions are also reproduced for phagosomes inside J774 mouse macrophages (Figure S1A). Therefore, phagocytosed beads appear to replicate specific maturation-dependent aspects of motion within the endophagosomal pathway. Phagosomes mature beyond the EP stage within ∼10 min of ingestion in Dictyostelium (Barak et al., 2014Barak P. Rai A. Dubey A.K. Rai P. Mallik R. Reconstitution of microtubule-dependent organelle transport.Methods Enzymol. 2014; 540: 231-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). It was therefore practically impossible to assay inside Dictyostelium cells how motor function changes from EPs to LPs.Figure S1Motion and Force Generation of Phagosomes Inside Macrophage Cells: Calculation of the Area ACONTACT from Where Dyneins Can Contact an MT to Drive Cargo Transport, Related to Figures 1 and 3Show full caption(A) Representative video tracks of early phagosomes (EPs) and late phagosomes (LPs) moving inside J774 mouse macrophage cells.

Two dynein molecules (each of length D = 70nm) are attached to points P and P’ on the cargo, and at S and S’ on the MT. P’S’ = PS = D. The permissible arc along which cargo-bound dyneins can contact the MT is PP’ (shown in red). Dyneins attached to cargo beyond this arc are not long enough to reach the MT. The projection of arc PP’ on the MT is SS’, and is the maximum length along this MT on which cargo-bound dyneins can engage. The direction of dynein driven motion is shown (arrow).Right: The same cargo is now visualized looking upward from beneath the MT (see blue arrow in left panel). Dyneins situated exactly atop the MT (along SS’) can engage the MT. Dyneins that are attached to cargo within a distance D perpendicular to the MT may also be able to reach the MT. Therefore, the maximum possible area of contact for dyneins ( = ACONTACT) can be approximated as the shaded rectangle (though this is likely an overestimate of the contact area).Bottom (gray box) Arc length PP’ and ACONTACT are calculated in terms of R and D. If dyneins are randomly placed on the cargo, then the probability of dynein to attach within ACONTACT is the ratio of ACONTACT to total surface area of cargo ( = 4πR2).

Detailed protocols have been described (also see Experimental Procedures) for purification of EPs and LPs from Dictyostelium using a pulse-chase strategy (Barak et al., 2014Barak P. Rai A. Dubey A.K.

Phagosomes purified from Dictyostelium were used for in vitro motility assays (Figure 1B; Movies S2 and S3) on polarity-labeled MTs (Soppina et al., 2009aSoppina V. Rai A. Mallik R. Simple non-fluorescent polarity labeling of microtubules for molecular motor assays.Biotechniques. 2009; 46: 543-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We verified the identity and purity of EPs and LPs purified in a similar manner from J774 or RAW264.7 mouse macrophage cell lines (Experimental Procedures; also see Figure S2). A clear difference was observed (Figure 1B) between motion of purified EPs (bidirectional with frequent reversals) and LPs (unidirectional retrograde, with rare reversals). In vitro motion of EPs and LPs was characteristically similar to their corresponding motion inside cells (compare Figures 1A and 1B). Figure 1B also shows bidirectional and unidirectional tracks of endosomes purified from Dictyostelium, which appear very similar to EPs (bidirectional) and LPs (unidirectional). The velocity of purified EPs, LPs, and endosomes during uninterrupted segments of motion was statistically same as their respective velocities inside cells (Figure 1C). Figure 1D reports run lengths for purified EPs and LPs (35 of each used for analysis). A run was defined as a period of uninterrupted fast motion (Rai et al., 2013Rai A.K. Rai A. Ramaiya A.J. Jha R. Mallik R. Molecular adaptations allow dynein to generate large collective forces inside cells.Cell. 2013; 152: 172-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, Soppina et al., 2009bSoppina V.

USA. 2009; 106: 19381-19386Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). No difference in plus-directed run lengths was seen between EPs and LPs. In contrast, minus-end-directed LPs usually moved much farther than EPs (Figure 1D). The actual run length is likely larger for these LPs, because they often got stuck at obstacles or reached the end of the MT during in vitro motion. Note that runs of EPs could end in reversals or detachments from the MT. The persistent long minus-end-directed runs of purified LPs along single MTs is reminiscent of similar observations inside mouse macrophages (Rai et al., 2013Rai A.K. Rai A. Ramaiya A.J. Jha R. Mallik R. Molecular adaptations allow dynein to generate large collective forces inside cells.Cell. 2013; 152: 172-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and may facilitate degradative fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes (Blocker et al., 1997Blocker A.

The above data show that a switch from bidirectional (EP) to retrograde unidirectional (LP) motion in the phagosomal/endosomal pathway is reproduced in our in vitro motility assays. To understand the mechanism of this switch, we measured the force generated by motors on purified EPs and LPs using an optical trap (Experimental Procedures). Motors on EPs generated vigorous force in both directions, with frequent transitions between plus and minus-end-directed stalls (Figure 2A)."
https://openalex.org/W2259214628,"Expression of HNF1A and KRT81 stratifies pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma tumors into different subtypes, and expression of cytochrome P450 3A5 mediates basal and/or drug-induced therapy resistance in each subtype. Although subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) have been described, this malignancy is clinically still treated as a single disease. Here we present patient-derived models representing the full spectrum of previously identified quasi-mesenchymal (QM-PDA), classical and exocrine-like PDAC subtypes, and identify two markers—HNF1A and KRT81—that enable stratification of tumors into different subtypes by using immunohistochemistry. Individuals with tumors of these subtypes showed substantial differences in overall survival, and their tumors differed in drug sensitivity, with the exocrine-like subtype being resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and paclitaxel. Cytochrome P450 3A5 (CYP3A5) metabolizes these compounds in tumors of the exocrine-like subtype, and pharmacological or short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated CYP3A5 inhibition sensitizes tumor cells to these drugs. Whereas hepatocyte nuclear factor 4, alpha (HNF4A) controls basal expression of CYP3A5, drug-induced CYP3A5 upregulation is mediated by the nuclear receptor NR1I2. CYP3A5 also contributes to acquired drug resistance in QM-PDA and classical PDAC, and it is highly expressed in several additional malignancies. These findings designate CYP3A5 as a predictor of therapy response and as a tumor cell–autonomous detoxification mechanism that must be overcome to prevent drug resistance."

https://openalex.org/W2263650999,"Sighs are long, deep breaths expressing sadness, relief or exhaustion. Sighs also occur spontaneously every few minutes to reinflate alveoli, and sighing increases under hypoxia, stress, and certain psychiatric conditions. Here we use molecular, genetic, and pharmacologic approaches to identify a peptidergic sigh control circuit in murine brain. Small neural subpopulations in a key breathing control centre, the retrotrapezoid nucleus/parafacial respiratory group (RTN/pFRG), express bombesin-like neuropeptide genes neuromedin B (Nmb) or gastrin-releasing peptide (Grp). These project to the preBötzinger Complex (preBötC), the respiratory rhythm generator, which expresses NMB and GRP receptors in overlapping subsets of ~200 neurons. Introducing either neuropeptide into preBötC or onto preBötC slices, induced sighing or in vitro sigh activity, whereas elimination or inhibition of either receptor reduced basal sighing, and inhibition of both abolished it. Ablating receptor-expressing neurons eliminated basal and hypoxia-induced sighing, but left breathing otherwise intact initially. We propose that these overlapping peptidergic pathways comprise the core of a sigh control circuit that integrates physiological and perhaps emotional input to transform normal breaths into sighs. The peptidergic neuronal circuit controlling sigh generation has been identified as ~200 Nmb- or Grp-expressing neurons in the RTN/pFRG breathing control centre of the medulla that project to ~200 receptor-expressing neurons in the respiratory rhythm generator, the preBötzinger Complex. Although sighs are an integral part of breathing and respiratory physiology, little is known about the neuronal circuits controlling this behaviour. Here, Mark Krasnow and colleagues identify a small subset of genetically defined neurons in the medulla that project to the preBötzinger complex (preBötC), the respiratory rhythm generator, to drive sighing. Inhibition of this connection could completely eliminate sighs, while regular breathing was left intact. The authors propose a mechanism by which specific preBötC neurons may integrate physiological and possibly emotional inputs to turn regular breaths into sighs when appropriate."

For example, individuals with a chronic, functionally complete SCI immediately regained the ability to stand and produce voluntary movements during continuous EES of lumbar segments (Angeli et al., 2014Angeli C.A.

These preliminary results have triggered the deployment of clinical studies that evaluate the potential of EES to improve motor recovery after SCI. However, the mechanisms through which EES enables the production of motor patterns remain enigmatic, even though this understanding is pivotal in the translation of this paradigm into a viable clinical application.

Neurophysiol. 2015; 114: 400-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) provided evidence that EES primarily engages large myelinated fibers associated with proprioceptive and cutaneous feedback circuits. The prevailing view is that the recruitment of these fibers raises the excitability of spinal circuits and modulates central pattern generator networks (Angeli et al., 2014Angeli C.A. Edgerton V.R.

However, this strategy fails to address subject-specific deficits of gait and balance throughout movement execution, which is essential to maximize the outcome of rehabilitation protocols (Barbeau et al., 1999Barbeau H. McCrea D.A. O’Donovan M.J. Rossignol S. Grill W.M. Lemay M.A. Tapping into spinal circuits to restore motor function.Brain Res. Brain Res.

In this study, we hypothesized that EES paradigms exploiting the dynamic properties of spinal circuits in real time provide the opportunity to target subject-specific motor deficits, mediating superior therapeutic effects compared to tonic stimulation. We previously showed that closed-loop control of EES is capable of modulating gait features during locomotion in rats with complete SCI (Wenger et al., 2014Wenger N. Moraud E.M. Raspopovic S. Bonizzato M. DiGiovanna J. Musienko P. Morari M. Micera S. Courtine G. Closed-loop neuromodulation of spinal sensorimotor circuits controls refined locomotion after complete spinal cord injury.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 255ra133Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, the design of EES paradigms that ecologically interact with spinal circuit dynamics is contingent on a mechanistic understanding of how the recruitment of large myelinated fibers translates into modulation of muscle activity (Courtine and Bloch, 2015Courtine G. Bloch J. Defining ecological strategies in neuroprosthetics.Neuron. 2015; 86: 29-33Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Computational models have played an important role in guiding the application of neuromodulation therapies to alleviate motor deficits in Parkinson’s disease (McIntyre and Foutz, 2013McIntyre C.C. Foutz T.J. Computational modeling of deep brain stimulation.in: Vinken P.J. Bruyn G.W. Handbook of Clinical Neurology. Elsevier, 2013: 55-61Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and neuropathic pain (Zhang et al., 2014Zhang T.C. Janik J.J. Grill W.M. Mechanisms and models of spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain.Brain Res. 2014; 1569: 19-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Here, we developed a computational model that predicts the interactions between EES and spinal circuit dynamics. Simulations uncovered the mechanisms through which EES interacts with muscle spindle feedback circuits to modulate standing and walking in the absence of supraspinal contribution. We found that spinal circuits filter the modulating effects of EES toward functionally relevant pathways. This finding steered the design of stimulation protocols that reestablished gait symmetry and corrected balance deficits in rats with incomplete and complete SCI. These results establish a computational framework for the development of neuromodulation therapies that harness spinal circuit dynamics to facilitate rehabilitation and recovery in patients with SCI. To study the mechanisms through which EES leads to motor pattern formation, we elaborated a dynamic model wherein muscle spindle feedback circuits receive natural sensory input from realistic hindlimb neurobiomechanics. First, we modeled muscle spindle feedback pathways and integrated these circuits within the minimal neuronal network that is responsible for the reciprocal recruitment of agonist muscles. This neural network, inspired from experimental (Jankowska, 1992Jankowska E. Interneuronal relay in spinal pathways from proprioceptors.Prog.

To simulate serotonin-mediated modulation of motoneuron membrane dynamics that is required to enable locomotion in rats with SCI (Courtine et al., 2009Courtine G. Gerasimenko Y. van den Brand R. Yew A. Musienko P. Zhong H. Song B. Ao Y. Ichiyama R.M. Lavrov I. et al.Transformation of nonfunctional spinal circuits into functional states after the loss of brain input.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar), we reduced the conductance of potassium-calcium gated ion channels in the model (Booth et al., 1997Booth V. Rinzel J.

Neurophysiol. 1997; 78: 3371-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Second, we estimated the time profiles of firing rates of group-Ia and group-II afferent fibers during gait using a muscle spindle model (Prochazka and Gorassini, 1998aProchazka A. Gorassini M. Ensemble firing of muscle afferents recorded during normal locomotion in cats.J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, Prochazka and Gorassini, 1998bProchazka A. Gorassini M. Models of ensemble firing of muscle spindle afferents recorded during normal locomotion in cats.J. Physiol. 1998; 507: 277-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and a validated biomechanical model of the rat hindlimb (Johnson et al., 2011Johnson W.L. Jindrich D.L. Hui Z. Roy R.R. Edgerton V.R. Application of a rat hindlimb model: a prediction of force spaces reachable through stimulation of nerve fascicles. Biomedical Engineering.IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng. 2011; 58: 3328-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We recorded joint trajectories during locomotion in healthy rats and estimated muscle stretch profiles of flexor (tibialis anterior) and extensor (gastrocnemius medialis) muscles of the ankle through inverse kinematics (Figure 1B). Third, we modeled the interactions between the natural firing rate of efferent and afferent fibers and the depolarization elicited by EES pulses. These interactions are non-linear, since EES-induced depolarization may fail to elicit action potentials if the stimulation collides with ongoing depolarization or refractory state (Figures 1C and S1). To account for this non-linearity, we computed the membrane summation of natural and EES-induced depolarization for each simulated fiber. Estimates of the percentage of recruited fibers were derived from our validated finite element model of EES (Capogrosso et al., 2013Capogrosso M. Wenger N. Raspopovic S. Musienko P. Beauparlant J. Bassi Luciani L. Courtine G. Micera S. A computational model for epidural electrical stimulation of spinal sensorimotor circuits.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 19326-19340Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Fourth, we converted efferent firing rates into electromyographic (EMG) activity by convolving wavelets of Gaussian-distributed amplitudes and durations with population of action potentials (Figure S1D). To validate the predicted interactions between EES and the neuronal network, we assessed whether the model was able to qualitatively replicate the spinal reflex recruitment curves elicited by EES (Gerasimenko et al., 2006Gerasimenko Y.P. Lavrov I.A. Courtine G. Ichiyama R.M. Dy C.J. Zhong H. Roy R.R. Edgerton V.R. Spinal cord reflexes induced by epidural spinal cord stimulation in normal awake rats.J. Neurosci. Methods. 2006; 157: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We simulated the recruitment of afferent and efferent fibers in response to single EES pulses of increasing intensity and computed motor responses evoked in ankle muscles. We then compared simulations with experimental recordings in rats (n = 3). Until half the saturation range, EES only elicited medium- and late-latency motor responses through the recruitment of afferent fibers (92% energy of medium responses in simulations; 96% ± 2% in experiments). The shape, latency, and modulation of these responses exhibited qualitative similarities in the model and in vivo (Figure 1E). At higher intensities, EES additionally recruited efferent fibers, which led to the progressive decrease and eventual suppression of medium- and late-latency motor responses, both in the model and in vivo (66% energy of early responses in simulations; 67% ± 20% in experiments). We then exploited the computational model to study the impact of EES frequency and amplitude on the firing rate of afferent and efferent fibers during locomotion. We found that increments in frequency ranging from 10 to 100 Hz led to a linear increase in the mean firing rate of group-Ia and group-II afferents (Figure 2A; R2 = 0.99 for extensors and flexor). A comparable modulation was observed when increasing EES amplitude from 0.8 to 2 times the motor threshold, although the responses rapidly reached saturation due to the recruitment of all fibers. In all conditions, however, the temporal profiles of afferent firing rates were preserved, indicating that EES does not interfere with the natural encoding of locomotor-related information. The integration of afferent firing rates into the neuronal network led to reciprocal activation of extensor and flexor motoneurons during specific phases of gait (Figures 2B and S2). Increments in EES frequency mediated a linear increase in the firing rates of both extensor (R2 = 0.99) and flexor (R2 = 0.93) motoneurons. Due to reciprocal inhibitory networks, this modulation only occurred during the phase corresponding to the natural recruitment of motoneurons (Figure S2), regardless of EES frequency. In contrast, increasing EES amplitude recruited the axons of motoneurons, including during the inactive phase, which disrupted the natural alternation between extensor and flexor (Figure 2B). We tested whether the model was able to predict the modulation of muscle activity mediated by varying EES frequencies and amplitudes during gait, and under different conditions of standing and walking. For stimulation values normally used during experimental recordings (40 Hz frequency, 1.2 motor threshold amplitude), the model generated reciprocal bursts of modulated electromyographic activity in extensor and flexor muscles that matched experimental observations in rats with complete SCI (r = 0.86 and 0.85 for extensors and flexors; Figure 2C). These bursts were composed of modulated medium- and late-latency responses that were locked to each pulse of EES (Figure S3A). A 2-fold increase in EES frequency induced a higher density of responses, which augmented the overall muscle activity (25% ± 8% for extensors and 27% ± 7% for flexors in the model versus 29% ± 15% for extensors and 33% ± 16% for flexors in vivo, n = 55 steps; Figure S3B). However, the reciprocal activation between antagonist muscles remained unaffected, both in the model and in vivo (Figure 2C). Increasing EES amplitude led to co-activation of extensor and flexor muscles, as observed in simulations. EES enables spinal circuits isolated from supraspinal inputs to use sensory information as a source of control to produce motor patterns for standing and walking at different speeds (Courtine et al., 2009Courtine G. Gerasimenko Y. van den Brand R. Yew A. Musienko P. Zhong H. Song B. Ao Y. Ichiyama R.M. Lavrov I. et al.Transformation of nonfunctional spinal circuits into functional states after the loss of brain input.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). The model reproduced the differential modulation of burst durations in extensor and flexor muscles with increasing treadmill velocities and during transitions from walking to standing (Figure 2D; Movie S1). These combined results support the validity of our model and suggest that EES modulates muscle spindle feedback circuits to facilitate the alternating recruitment of antagonist motor pools in the absence of supraspinal input. Simulations show that reciprocal inhibition restricts the effects of EES to the phase during which motoneurons are recruited (Figures 2B, S3, and S4). This result suggests that phase-dependent modulation of muscle spindle feedback circuits filters the effects of EES toward functionally relevant pathways. We hypothesized that this property may be exploited to selectively modulate flexor versus extensor muscles through phase-specific adjustment of EES. We performed simulations in which EES frequency was independently tuned during stance versus swing phases. These simulations revealed that phase-specific EES gradually and specifically modulates the activity of extensor versus flexor muscles (Figures 3A and S4A). We tested whether the same specificity was obtained in rats with complete SCI. The combination of a serotonin replacement therapy and midline EES enabled locomotion in all rats (Courtine et al., 2009Courtine G. Gerasimenko Y. van den Brand R. Yew A. Musienko P. Zhong H. Song B. Ao Y. Ichiyama R.M. Lavrov I. et al.Transformation of nonfunctional spinal circuits into functional states after the loss of brain input.Nat. Neurosci. 2009; 12: 1333-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). We expanded our real-time stimulation platform (Wenger et al., 2014Wenger N. Moraud E.M. Raspopovic S. Bonizzato M. DiGiovanna J. Musienko P. Morari M. Micera S. Courtine G. Closed-loop neuromodulation of spinal sensorimotor circuits controls refined locomotion after complete spinal cord injury.Sci. Transl. Med. 2014; 6: 255ra133Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) to enable closed-loop adjustment of EES parameters based on bilateral hindlimb kinematics. Automated detections of foot strikes divided gait into interleaved left and right phases (Figure 3B). During stepping, extensor muscles of one hindlimb are active at the same time as flexor muscles of the other hindlimb (Figure 3C). Consequently, model predictions suggested that changes in EES frequency during the left-stance phase would simultaneously modulate left extensor and right flexor muscles and inversely for the right-stance phase. Experimental recordings validated these predictions. We found a linear relationship between EES frequency and the amplitude of ipsilateral extensor and contralateral flexor muscles (Figures 3C, 3D, and S4B). These effects were restricted to the period during which muscles were active, confirming the ability of phase-specific EES to modulate distinct spinal circuits during gait. We next sought to leverage these properties to develop control policies that actively tune left versus right hindlimb movements during locomotion. We conducted a comprehensive mapping of changes in left and right step heights for pairs of EES frequencies ranging from 20 to 80 Hz, which we represented in a 3D space (n > 300 steps per rat; Figures 4B and S5). Each hindlimb displayed a linear relationship between step height and phase-specific EES frequency, which was independent of the contralateral hindlimb. Consequently, the modulation for each hindlimb laid on a planar surface (Figure 4B). These planes quantified the degree of asymmetry between the left and right steps, while their intersection defined the pairs of EES frequency that are theoretically appropriate to correct these idiosyncratic deficits (Figure 4C). To test this possibility, we embedded a control structure within the real-time stimulation platform, composed of two controllers interleaved in time. Each controller monitored the foot trajectory of one hindlimb and adjusted EES frequency during its swing phase to target a desired step height, regardless of the other limb (Figure 5A). We thus capitalized on phase-dependent modulation of spinal circuits to control a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system out of two independent controllers operating in parallel. To evaluate the performance of this control structure, we applied sudden changes in the desired step height for each hindlimb independently (Figures 5B and S6B). For each task, the controllers successfully adjusted phase-specific EES frequencies to target the desired step height of each hindlimb with high precision (error <5 mm), even when imposing references reaching the physiological limits of motion (Figure S6B). More complex feed-forward predictive models that implicitly account for time and interlimb effects required longer convergence times and failed to improve performance (Figure S6C). We next tested whether closed-loop control of phase-specific EES frequencies is able to correct idiosyncratic deficits of gait and balance. Each injured rat exhibited a distinct degree of asymmetry that altered interlimb coordination and balance, primarily due to discrepancies in the recruitment of extensor muscles (Figure 6A). We configured the controller to maintain left and right steps at the same height. Corrections in EES frequency during the stance phase of the weaker hindlimb augmented extensor muscle activity and promoted whole-limb extension. This tuning reestablished symmetry and distributed vertical ground reaction forces equally in all tested rats (p < 0.001 for each rat; Figure 6A; Movie S3). The controller converged toward EES frequency pairs that scattered along the symmetry line defined by the intersection of the correlation planes (Figure 6B). These adaptions also restored balance. During controlled conditions, the center of pressure displayed oscillations centered on the body midline, which contrasted with the pronounced lateral shifts underlying non-controlled steps (p < 0.001; Figure 6C). Moreover, the distribution of ground reaction forces was less variable during controlled compared to non-controlled steps (p < 0.001). We then evaluated whether the controller was able to maintain gait performance while increasing weight-bearing levels and speeds, two behavioral conditions that involve enhanced physical effort. During non-controlled steps, reduction of body-weight support led to a decrease in step height and extension, together with increased variability (Figure 7A). The controller adjusted EES frequency to preserve left and right foot elevation. Tuning of EES frequency reinforced the activity of extensor muscles, which resulted in larger vertical ground reaction forces that enabled the rats to sustain increased loads equivalent to 15% of their body weight (Figure 7A; Movie S4). During transitions from normal to high speeds, injured rats exhibited an increase in backward foot movements during stance and pronounced dragging during swing, which reflected their difficulties to meet task requirements (Figure 7B). The controller adjusted EES frequencies to alleviate these deficits (p < 0.01 for each rat). Finally, we sought to evaluate the translational potential of phase-specific EES protocols. SCI in humans primarily results from contusion injuries, which lead to variable damage. Consequently, these lesions induce a broad spectrum of asymmetries in gait deficits (Friedli et al., 2015Friedli L. Rosenzweig E.S. Barraud Q. Schubert M. Dominici N. Awai L. Nielson J.L. Musienko P. Nout-Lomas Y. Zhong H. et al.Pronounced species divergence in corticospinal tract reorganization and functional recovery after lateralized spinal cord injury favors primates.Sci. Transl. Med. 2015; 7: 302ra134Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Moreover, the severity and specificity of the SCI is likely to determine the appropriate level of serotoninergic replacement therapies to facilitate gait. To address these issues, we first studied whether the modulation of muscle activity with EES frequency was preserved in the absence of serotoninergic replacement therapies. We withdrew serotonin-mediated modulation of motoneuron membrane dynamics in the model (Figure 8A). Simulations showed that the absence of serotonin reduced muscle burst amplitude, but did not affect the alternation between extensor and flexor muscles. Moreover, the modulation of muscle activity during changes in EES frequency was preserved, which compensated for the withdrawal of serotonin (Figure 8A). To validate these results, we placed a lateralized contusion SCI that induced different degrees of gait asymmetry and deficits (Figures 8B, 8C, and S7). Without serotonin, EES promoted locomotion in all tested rats despite a significant decrease in muscle activity (p < 0.05; Figure 8B). As observed in the model, the tuning of muscle activity and hindlimb kinematics was conserved during changes in EES frequency, which robustly modulated hindlimb movements. We then personalized the serotoninergic replacement therapy for each"

However, the absence of cycling transitions in molecules poses a challenge for direct laser cooling of the ions, and for controlling and detecting their quantum states. Previously used state-detection techniques based on photodissociation or chemical reactions are destructive and therefore inefficient, restricting the achievable resolution in laser spectroscopy. Here, we experimentally demonstrate non-destructive detection of the quantum state of a single trapped molecular ion through its strong Coulomb coupling to a well controlled, co-trapped atomic ion. An algorithm based on a state-dependent optical dipole force changes the internal state of the atom according to the internal state of the molecule. We show that individual quantum states in the molecular ion can be distinguished by the strength of their coupling to the optical dipole force. We also observe quantum jumps (induced by black-body radiation) between rotational states of a single molecular ion. Using the detuning dependence of the state-detection signal, we implement a variant of quantum logic spectroscopy of a molecular resonance. Our state-detection technique is relevant to a wide range of molecular ions, and could be applied to state-controlled quantum chemistry and to spectroscopic investigations of molecules that serve as probes for interstellar clouds."

Using whole-cell electrophysiology, two-photon calcium imaging, and glutamate uncaging in hippocampal slices, we discovered a functional coupling between NMDA receptor activation and ryanodine-sensitive intracellular calcium release that dominates the spatiotemporal dynamics of activity-dependent calcium signals during synaptogenesis. This developmentally regulated calcium amplification mechanism was tuned to detect and bind spatially clustered and temporally correlated synaptic inputs and enacted a local cooperative plasticity rule between coactive neighboring synapses. Consistent with the hypothesis that synapse maturation is spatially regulated, we observed clustering of synaptic weights in developing dendritic arbors. These results reveal developmental features of NMDA receptor-dependent calcium dynamics and local plasticity rules that are suited to spatially guide synaptic connectivity patterns in emerging neural networks."

In Drosophila, direction-selective T4 and T5 cells respond to moving brightness increments (ON) and decrements (OFF), respectively. Current algorithmic models of the circuit are based on the interaction of two differentially filtered signals. However, electron microscopy studies have shown that T5 cells receive their major input from four classes of neurons: Tm1, Tm2, Tm4, and Tm9. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we demonstrate that T5 is the first direction-selective stage within the OFF pathway. The four cells provide an array of spatiotemporal filters to T5. Silencing their synaptic output in various combinations, we find that all input elements are involved in OFF motion detection to varying degrees. Our comprehensive survey challenges the simplified view of how neural systems compute the direction of motion and suggests that an intricate interplay of many signals results in direction selectivity."
https://openalex.org/W2261304294,"With evaluation for physical performance, measuring muscle mass is an important step in detecting sarcopenia. However, there are no methods to estimate muscle mass from blood sampling.To develop a new equation to estimate total-body muscle mass with serum creatinine and cystatin C level, we designed a cross-sectional study with separate derivation and validation cohorts. Total body muscle mass and fat mass were measured using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 214 adults aged 25 to 84 years who underwent physical checkups from 2010 to 2013 in a single tertiary hospital. Serum creatinine and cystatin C levels were also examined.Serum creatinine was correlated with muscle mass (P < .001), and serum cystatin C was correlated with body fat mass (P < .001) after adjusting glomerular filtration rate (GFR). After eliminating GFR, an equation to estimate total-body muscle mass was generated and coefficients were calculated in the derivation cohort. There was an agreement between muscle mass calculated by the novel equation and measured by DXA in both the derivation and validation cohort (P < .001, adjusted R2 = 0.829, β = 0.95, P < .001, adjusted R2 = 0.856, β = 1.03, respectively).The new equation based on serum creatinine and cystatin C levels can be used to estimate total-body muscle mass."
https://openalex.org/W2259898997,"TGF-β is important in lung injury and remodeling processes. TGF-β and Wingless/integrase-1 (WNT) signaling are interconnected; however, the WNT ligand-receptor complexes involved are unknown. Thus, we aimed to identify Frizzled (FZD) receptors that mediate TGF-β-induced profibrotic signaling. MRC-5 and primary human lung fibroblasts were stimulated with TGF-β1, WNT-5A, or WNT-5B in the presence and absence of specific pathway inhibitors. Specific small interfering RNA was used to knock down FZD8. In vivo studies using bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis were performed in wild-type and FZD8-deficient mice. TGF-β1 induced FZD8 specifically via Smad3-dependent signaling in MRC-5 and primary human lung fibroblasts. It is noteworthy that FZD8 knockdown reduced TGF-β1-induced collagen Iα1, fibronectin, versican, α-smooth muscle (sm)-actin, and connective tissue growth factor. Moreover, bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis was attenuated in FZD8-deficient mice in vivo Although inhibition of canonical WNT signaling did not affect TGF-β1-induced gene expression in vitro, noncanonical WNT-5B mimicked TGF-β1-induced fibroblast activation. FZD8 knockdown reduced both WNT-5B-induced gene expression of fibronectin and α-sm-actin, as well as WNT-5B-induced changes in cellular impedance. Collectively, our findings demonstrate a role for FZD8 in TGF-β-induced profibrotic signaling and imply that WNT-5B may be the ligand for FZD8 in these responses.-Spanjer, A. I. R., Baarsma, H. A., Oostenbrink, L. M., Jansen, S. R., Kuipers, C. C., Lindner, M., Postma, D. S., Meurs, H., Heijink, I. H., Gosens, R., Königshoff, M.

https://openalex.org/W2260187185,"Protein O-fucosyltransferase 2 (POFUT2) is an essential enzyme that fucosylates serine and threonine residues of folded thrombospondin type 1 repeats (TSRs). To date, the mechanism by which this enzyme recognizes very dissimilar TSRs has been unclear. By engineering a fusion protein, we report the crystal structure of Caenorhabditis elegans POFUT2 (CePOFUT2) in complex with GDP and human TSR1 that suggests an inverting mechanism for fucose transfer assisted by a catalytic base and shows that nearly half of the TSR1 is embraced by CePOFUT2. A small number of direct interactions and a large network of water molecules maintain the complex. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrates that POFUT2 fucosylates threonine preferentially over serine and relies on folded TSRs containing the minimal consensus sequence C-X-X-S/T-C. Crystallographic and mutagenesis data, together with atomic-level simulations, uncover a binding mechanism by which POFUT2 promiscuously recognizes the structural fingerprint of poorly homologous TSRs through a dynamic network of water-mediated interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2265256831,"By proteomics analysis of conditioned media from cells with constitutive mTORC1 activity, Yu and colleagues identify IGF binding protein 5 (IGFBP5) as a protein that is induced by mTORC1 through HIF1 and that blocks IGF-1 signalling. The PI(3)K–Akt–mTORC1 pathway is a highly dynamic network that is balanced and stabilized by a number of feedback inhibition loops1,2. Specifically, activation of mTORC1 has been shown to lead to the inhibition of its upstream growth factor signalling. Activation of the growth factor receptors is triggered by the binding of their cognate ligands in the extracellular space. However, whether secreted proteins contribute to the mTORC1-dependent feedback loops remains unclear. We found that cells with hyperactive mTORC1 secrete a protein that potently inhibits the function of IGF-1. Using a large-scale, unbiased quantitative proteomic platform, we comprehensively characterized the rapamycin-sensitive secretome in TSC2−/− mouse embryonic fibroblasts, and identified IGFBP5 as a secreted, mTORC1 downstream effector protein. IGFBP5 is a direct transcriptional target of HIF1, which itself is a known mTORC1 target3. IGFBP5 is a potent inhibitor of both the signalling and functional outputs of IGF-1. Once secreted, IGFBP5 cooperates with intracellular branches of the feedback mechanisms to block the activation of IGF-1 signalling. Finally, IGFBP5 is a potential tumour suppressor, and the proliferation of IGFBP5-mutated cancer cells is selectively blocked by IGF-1R inhibitors."

The rod-shaped cells of the δ-proteobacterium Myxococcus xanthus, assemble 5–10 T4P at the leading cell pole that extend and retract to generate cell movement in the direction of the long axis of cells (14.Kaiser D.

M. xanthus is the model system for this type of T4P-dependent directional movement, but the biochemistry of the T4P assembly system in this organism has not been studied in detail. Similarly to other T4PS in Gram-negative bacteria, the T4PS of M. xanthus consists of 12 conserved proteins. The nomenclature for proteins of T4PS varies widely between organisms, even for highly conserved proteins. Here, we use the nomenclature used for the M. xanthus T4PS. The pilin PilA is added onto the pilus base of the T4PS after cleavage of the class III signal sequence of the pre-pilin by the pre-pilin peptidase (PilD) (20.Nunn D.N. Lory S.

The T4PS in Gram-negative bacteria span both the IM and OM, whereas homologous systems in Gram-positive bacteria and in archaea only span the cytoplasmic membrane. Consistently, only the IM motor subcomplex is conserved in all T4PS. Moreover, the retraction ATPase PilT is only present in bacterial T4PS systems. Here, we investigate the IM protein PilC, the actin-like protein PilM, and the assembly ATPase PilB and analyze their function and association in the T4PS of M. xanthus. PilC is a polytopic IM protein that belongs to the GspF/PilC superfamily of IM proteins of T2SS and T4PS. Sequence analysis suggests that proteins of this family consist of two cytoplasmic domains with high sequence similarity, separated by two transmembrane domains and followed by a short C-terminal periplasmic extension. Here, we refer to M. xanthus PilC and homologs thereof in T4PS and T2SS as the IM platform protein (33.Takhar H.K. Kemp K. Kim M. Howell P.L. Burrows L.L.

As activation of autophagy is proposed to promote survival under FGFR/PTENi, we have investigated this relationship in a panel of 18 genetically diverse bladder cell lines. We found that autophagy inhibition does not sensitise bladder cell lines to FGFR/PTENi, but newly identify an autophagy-independent cell death synergy in FGFR3-mutant cell lines between mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway inhibitors and chloroquine (CQ)—an anti-malarial drug used as a cancer therapy adjuvant in over 30 clinical trials. The mechanism of synergy is consistent with lysosomal cell death (LCD), including cathepsin-driven caspase activation, and correlates with suppression of cSREBP1 and cholesterol biosynthesis in sensitive cell lines. Remarkably, loss of viability can be rescued by saturating cellular membranes with cholesterol or recapitulated by statin-mediated inhibition, or small interfering RNA knockdown, of enzymes regulating cholesterol metabolism. Modulation of CQ-induced cell death by atorvastatin and cholesterol is reproduced across numerous cell lines, confirming a novel and fundamental role for cholesterol biosynthesis in regulating LCD. Thus, we have catalogued the molecular events underlying cell death induced by CQ in combination with an anticancer therapeutic. Moreover, by revealing a hitherto unknown aspect of lysosomal biology under stress, we propose that suppression of cholesterol metabolism in cancer cells should elicit synergy with CQ and define a novel approach to future cancer treatments."

Dendrite-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion ensures that the dendrites of Drosophila dendritic arborization (da) sensory neurons are properly restricted in a 2D space, and thereby facilitates contact-mediated dendritic self-avoidance and tiling. However, the mechanisms regulating dendrite-ECM adhesion in vivo are poorly understood. Here, we show that mutations in the semaphorin ligand sema-2b lead to a dramatic increase in self-crossing of dendrites due to defects in dendrite-ECM adhesion, resulting in a failure to confine dendrites to a 2D plane. Furthermore, we find that Sema-2b is secreted from the epidermis and signals through the Plexin B receptor in neighboring neurons. Importantly, we find that Sema-2b/PlexB genetically and physically interacts with TORC2 complex, Tricornered (Trc) kinase, and integrins. These results reveal a novel role for semaphorins in dendrite patterning and illustrate how epidermal-derived cues regulate neural circuit assembly."
https://openalex.org/W2264397534,"The omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Among pro-inflammatory mediators, tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) plays a paradoxical role in cancer biology with induction of cancer cell death or survival depending on the cellular context. The objective of the study was to evaluate the role of TNFα in DHA-mediated tumor growth inhibition and colon cancer cell death. The treatment of human colorectal cancer cells, HCT-116 and HCT-8 cells, with DHA triggered apoptosis in autocrine TNFα-dependent manner. We demonstrated that DHA-induced increased content of TNFα mRNA occurred through a post-transcriptional regulation via the down-regulation of microRNA-21 (miR-21) expression. Treatment with DHA led to nuclear accumulation of Foxo3a that bounds to the miR-21 promoter triggering its transcriptional repression. Moreover, inhibition of RIP1 kinase and AMP-activated protein kinase α reduced Foxo3a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling and subsequent increase of TNFα expression through a decrease of miR-21 expression in DHA-treated colon cancer cells. Finally, we were able to show in HCT-116 xenograft tumor-bearing nude mice that a DHA-enriched diet induced a decrease of human miR-21 expression and an increase of human TNFα mRNA expression limiting tumor growth in a cancer cell-derived TNFα dependent manner. Altogether, the present work highlights a novel mechanism for anti-cancer action of DHA involving colon cancer cell death mediated through autocrine action of TNFα."

However, an aberrant regulation of KB homeostasis can lead to complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Exercise and diabetes affect systemic KB homeostasis, but the regulation of KB metabolism is still enigmatic. In our study in mice with either knockout or overexpression of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator (PGC)-1α in skeletal muscle, PGC-1α regulated ketolytic gene transcription in muscle. Furthermore, KB homeostasis of these mice was investigated during withholding of food, exercise, and ketogenic diet feeding, and after streptozotocin injection. In response to these ketogenic stimuli, modulation of PGC-1α levels in muscle affected systemic KB homeostasis. Moreover, the data demonstrate that skeletal muscle PGC-1α is necessary for the enhanced ketolytic capacity in response to exercise training and overexpression of PGC-1α in muscle enhances systemic ketolytic capacity and is sufficient to ameliorate diabetic hyperketonemia in mice. In cultured myotubes, the transcription factor estrogen-related receptor-α was a partner of PGC-1α in the regulation of ketolytic gene transcription.

The target-specific transcriptional activity of p53 is highly regulated. Here we demonstrate that acetylation of p53 at Lys-120 up-regulates its transcriptional activity toward Apaf-1, a core component in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, and thus sensitizes caspase activation and apoptosis. We found that histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, including butyrate, augment Lys-120 acetylation of p53 and thus Apaf-1 expression by inhibiting HDAC1. In p53-null cells, transfection of wild-type but not K120R mutant p53 can restore the p53-dependent sensitivity to butyrate. Strikingly, transfection of acetylation-mimicking K120Q mutant p53 is sufficient to up-regulates Apaf-1 in a manner independent of butyrate treatment. Therefore, HDAC inhibitors can induce p53 acetylation at lysine 120, which in turn enhances mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis through transcriptional up-regulation of Apaf-1.

However, the physiological significance of these modifications is largely unknown, and it remains unclear if these have a critical role in the normal and pathological functions of NF-κB in vivo. Among these, phosphorylation of the RelA(p65) Thr505 residue has been described as an important regulator of NF-κB activity in cell lines, but its physiological significance was not known. Therefore, to learn more about the role of this pathway in vivo, we generated a knockin mouse with a RelA T505A mutation. Unlike RelA knockout mice, the RelA T505A mice develop normally but exhibit aberrant hepatocyte proliferation following liver partial hepatectomy or damage resulting from carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) treatment. Consistent with these effects, RelA T505A mice exhibit earlier onset of cancer in the N-nitrosodiethylamine model of hepatocellular carcinoma. These data reveal a critical pathway controlling NF-κB function in the liver that acts to suppress the tumour-promoting activities of RelA."
https://openalex.org/W2254558694,"To date, the mutational status of EGFR and PTEN has been shown as relevant for favoring pro- or anti-tumor functions of STAT3 in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). We have screened genomic data from 154 patients and have identified a strong positive correlation between STAT3 and HDAC7 expression. In the current work we show the existence of a subpopulation of patients overexpressing HDAC7 and STAT3 that has particularly poor clinical outcome. Surprisingly, the somatic mutation rate of both STAT3 and HDAC7 was insignificant in GBM comparing with EGFR, PTEN or TP53. Depletion of HDAC7 in a range of GBM cells induced the expression of tyrosine kinase JAK1 and the tumor suppressor AKAP12. Both proteins synergistically sustained the activity of STAT3 by inducing its phosphorylation (JAK1) and protein expression (AKAP12). In absence of HDAC7, activated STAT3 was responsible for significant imbalance of secreted pro-/anti-angiogenic factors. This inhibited the migration and sprouting of endothelial cells in paracrine fashion in vitro as well as angiogenesis in vivo. In a murine model of GBM, induced HDAC7-silencing decreased the tumor burden by threefold. The current data show for the first time that silencing HDAC7 can reset the tumor suppressor activity of STAT3, independently of the EGFR/PTEN/TP53 background of the GBM. This effect could be exploited to overcome tumor heterogeneity and provide a new rationale behind the development of specific HDAC7 inhibitors for clinical use."

Simple and predictable trans-acting regulatory tools are needed in the fields of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering to build complex genetic circuits and optimize the levels of native and heterologous gene products. Transcription activator−like effectors (TALEs) are bacterial virulence factors that have recently gained traction in biotechnology applications owing to their customizable DNA-binding specificity. In this work we expanded the versatility of these transcription factors to create an inducible TALE system by inserting tobacco-etch virus (TEV) protease recognition sites into the TALE backbone. The resulting engineered TALEs maintain transcriptional repression of their target genes in Escherichia coli, but are degraded after induction of the TEV protease, thereby promoting expression of the previously repressed target gene of interest. This TALE-TEV technology enables both repression and induction of plasmid or chromosomal target genes in a manner analogous to traditional repressor proteins but with the added flexibility of being operator-agnostic."
https://openalex.org/W2262358389,"Activation of the extensive cross-talk among the receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), particularly ErbB family-Met cross-talk, has emerged as a likely source of drug resistance. Notwithstanding brilliant successes were attained while using small-molecule inhibitors or antibody therapeutics against specific RTKs in multiple cancers over recent decades, a high recurrence rate remains unsolved in patients treated with these targeted inhibitors. It is well aligned with multifaceted properties of cancer and cross-talk and convergence of signaling pathways of RTKs. Thereby many therapeutic interventions have been actively developed to overcome inherent or acquired resistance. To date, no bispecific antibody (BsAb) showed complete depletion of dual RTKs from the plasma membrane and efficient dual degradation. In this manuscript, we report the first findings of a target-specific dual internalization and degradation of membrane RTKs induced by designed BsAbs based on the internalizing monoclonal antibodies and the therapeutic values of these BsAbs. Leveraging the anti-Met mAb able to internalize and degrade by a unique mechanism, we generated the BsAbs for Met/epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Met/HER2 to induce an efficient EGFR or HER2 internalization and degradation in the presence of Met that is frequently overexpressed in the invasive tumors and involved in the resistance against EGFR- or HER2-targeted therapies. We found that Met/EGFR BsAb ME22S induces dissociation of the Met–EGFR complex from Hsp90, followed by significant degradation of Met and EGFR. By employing patient-derived tumor models we demonstrate therapeutic potential of the BsAb-mediated dual degradation in various cancers."

https://openalex.org/W2256576712,"Activated pancreatic stellate cells (PaSC) are key participants in the stroma of pancreatic cancer, secreting extracellular matrix proteins and inflammatory mediators. Tumors are poorly vascularized, creating metabolic stress conditions in cancer and stromal cells that necessitate adaptive homeostatic cellular programs. Activation of autophagy and the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) have been described in hepatic stellate cells, but the role of these processes in PaSC responses to metabolic stress is unknown. We reported that the PI3K/mTOR pathway, which AMPK can regulate through multiple inputs, modulates PaSC activation and fibrogenic potential. Here, using primary and immortalized mouse PaSC, we assess the relative contributions of AMPK/mTOR signaling, autophagy and the UPR to cell fate responses during metabolic stress induced by mitochondrial dysfunction. The mitochondrial uncoupler rottlerin at low doses (0.5-2.5 μM) was added to cells cultured in 10% FBS complete media. Mitochondria rapidly depolarized, followed by altered mitochondrial dynamics and decreased cellular ATP levels. This mitochondrial dysfunction elicited rapid, sustained AMPK activation, mTOR pathway inhibition, and blockade of autophagic flux. Rottlerin treatment also induced rapid, sustained PERK/CHOP UPR signaling. Subsequently, high doses (>5 μM) induced loss of cell viability and cell death. Interestingly, AMPK knock-down using siRNA did not prevent rottlerin-induced mTOR inhibition, autophagy, or CHOP upregulation, suggesting that AMPK is dispensable for these responses. Moreover, CHOP genetic deletion, but not AMPK knock-down, prevented rottlerin-induced apoptosis and supported cell survival, suggesting that UPR signaling is a major modulator of cell fate in PaSC during metabolic stress. Further, short-term rottlerin treatment reduced both PaSC fibrogenic potential and IL-6 mRNA expression. In contrast, expression levels of the angiogenic factors HGF and VEGFα were unaffected, and the immune modulator IL-4 was markedly upregulated. These data imply that metabolic stress-induced PaSC reprogramming differentially modulates neighboring cells in the tumor microenvironment."

Methods Change in county-level adult (≥20 years) obesity prevalence was calculated for a 5-year period (2004–2009). Community measures of economic, healthcare, recreational, food environment, population structure, and education contexts were also calculated. Regression analysis was used to assess community characteristics associated (p<0.01) with change in adult obesity prevalence. Results Mean±SD change in obesity prevalence was 5.1±2.4%. Obesity prevalence decreased in 1.4% (n = 44) and increased in 98% (n = 3,060) of counties from 2004–2009. Results showed that both baseline levels and increases in physically inactive adults were associated with greater increases in obesity prevalence, while baseline levels of and increases in physician density and grocery store/supercenter density were related to smaller increases in obesity rates. Baseline levels of the Hispanic population share were negatively linked to changing obesity levels, while places with greater Hispanic population growth saw greater increases in obesity. Conclusions Most counties in the U.S. experienced increases in adult obesity prevalence from 2004 to 2009. Findings suggest that community-based interventions targeting adult obesity need to incorporate a range of community factors, such as levels of physical inactivity, access to physicians, availability of food outlets, and ethnic/racial population composition."

We empirically compare different DNA-based species delimitation approaches for a rapid biodiversity assessment of hyperdiverse leaf beetle assemblages along an elevational gradient in southern Ecuador and explore their effect on species richness estimates.Based on a COI barcode data set of 674 leaf beetle specimens (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) of 266 morphospecies from three sample sites in the Podocarpus National Park, we employed statistical parsimony analysis, distance-based clustering, GMYC- and PTP-modelling to delimit species-like units and compared them to morphology-based (parataxonomic) species identifications. The four different approaches for DNA-based species delimitation revealed highly similar numbers of molecular operational taxonomic units (MOTUs) (n = 284-289). Estimated total species richness was considerably higher than the sampled amount, 414 for morphospecies (Chao2) and 469-481 for the different MOTU types. Assemblages at different elevational levels (1000 vs. 2000 m) had similar species numbers but a very distinct species composition for all delimitation methods. Most species were found only at one elevation while this turnover pattern was even more pronounced for DNA-based delimitation.Given the high congruence of DNA-based delimitation results, probably due to the sampling structure, our study suggests that when applied to species communities on a regionally limited level with high amount of rare species (i.e. ~50% singletons), the choice of species delimitation method can be of minor relevance for assessing species numbers and turnover in tropical insect communities. Therefore, DNA-based species delimitation is confirmed as a valuable tool for evaluating biodiversity of hyperdiverse insect communities, especially when exact taxonomic identifications are missing."
https://openalex.org/W2346083205,"Replication of the hepatitis C viral genome is catalyzed by the NS5B (nonstructural protein 5B) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which is a major target of antiviral drugs currently in the clinic. Prior studies established that initiation of RNA replication could be facilitated by starting with a dinucleotide (pGG). Here we establish conditions for efficient initiation from GTP to form the dinucleotide and subsequent intermediates leading to highly processive elongation, and we examined the effects of four classes of nonnucleoside inhibitors on each step of the reaction. We show that palm site inhibitors block initiation starting from GTP but not when starting from pGG. In addition we show that nonnucleoside inhibitors binding to thumb site-2 (NNI2) lead to the accumulation of abortive intermediates three-five nucleotides in length. Our kinetic analysis shows that NNI2 do not significantly block initiation or elongation of RNA synthesis; rather, they block the transition from initiation to elongation, which is thought to proceed with significant structural rearrangement of the enzyme-RNA complex including displacement of the β-loop from the active site. Direct measurement in single turnover kinetic studies show that pyrophosphate release is faster than the chemistry step, which appears to be rate-limiting during processive synthesis. These results reveal important new details to define the steps involved in initiation and elongation during viral RNA replication, establish the allosteric mechanisms by which NNI2 inhibitors act, and point the way to the design of more effective allosteric inhibitors that exploit this new information."
https://openalex.org/W2298303894,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease in which a single B-cell clone proliferates relentlessly in peripheral lymphoid organs, bone marrow, and blood. DNA sequencing experiments have shown that about 30% of CLL patients have stereotyped antigen-specific B-cell receptors (BCRs) with a high level of sequence homology in the variable domains of the heavy and light chains. These include many of the most aggressive cases that have IGHV-unmutated BCRs whose sequences have not diverged significantly from the germ line. This suggests a personalized therapy strategy in which a toxin or immune effector function is delivered selectively to the pathogenic B-cells but not to healthy B-cells. To execute this strategy, serum-stable, drug-like compounds able to target the antigen-binding sites of most or all patients in a stereotyped subset are required. We demonstrate here the feasibility of this approach with the discovery of selective, high affinity ligands for CLL BCRs of the aggressive, stereotyped subset 7P that cross-react with the BCRs of several CLL patients in subset 7p, but not with BCRs from patients outside this subset.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) 2The abbreviations used are: CLL, chronic lymphocytic leukemia; BCR, B-cell receptor; BLI, bio-layer interferometry; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; smIG, surface immunoglobulin; PE, phycoerythrin. is the most common type of adult blood cancer leukemia with ∼15,000 new cases reported every year in the United States (1.Esencay M. Hamad B. The chronic lymphocytic leukaemia market.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2015; 14: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). CLL involves the relentless expansion of a single B-cell clone, arguing that this occurs in response to a particular antigen, although the nature of these antigens is largely unknown (2.Chiorazzi N. Rai K.R. Ferrarini M. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar). Many cases of CLL follow a relatively indolent course, whereas others are highly aggressive. There have been impressive advances in the treatment of CLL. In addition to standard chemotherapy, anti-CD20 antibodies such as Rituximab, Ofatumumab, and Obinotuzumab are now used in combination or alone in standard clinical practice (1.Esencay M. Hamad B. The chronic lymphocytic leukaemia market.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2015; 14: 381-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 3.Jaglowski S.M. Alinari L. Lapalombella R. Muthusamy N. Byrd J.C. The clinical application of monoclonal antibodies in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Blood. 2010; 116: 3705-3714Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Inhibitors of Burton's tyrosine kinase, such as ibrutinib (4.Byrd J.C. Furman R.R. Coutre S.E. Flinn I.W. Burger J.A. Blum K.A. Grant B. Sharman J.P. Coleman M. Wierda W.G. Jones J.A. Zhao W.

Med. 2013; 369: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar), which blunt B-cell activation, also have shown considerable promise. Nonetheless, all drugs currently on the market or in clinical trials are general immunosuppressants that fail to distinguish the pathogenic CLL cells from healthy B-cells. Ideally, drug targets would be identified that allow selective suppression or killing of the malignant CLL cells without interfering with the normal function of the humoral immune system (5.Yang J. Baskar S. Kwong K.Y. Kennedy M.G. Wiestner A. Rader C. Therapeutic potential and challenges of targeting receptor tyrosine kinase ROR1 with monoclonal antibodies in B-cell malignancies.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6: e21018Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). One such target is the antigen-specific B-cell receptor (BCR) itself. Indeed, the pathogenic B-cells in a CLL patient are virtually the only cells in the body that express this particular receptor. Thus, if compounds highly selective for the receptor, with little off-target binding, could be discovered, it is possible that they could be employed chronically, unlike general B-cell killers. Although the antigen-binding pocket of an antibody is not generally considered a drug target, screening studies using phage-displayed peptide libraries have demonstrated the feasibility of obtaining selective ligands for the antigen-binding sites of some CLL BCRs (6.Buhl L. Szecsi P.B. Gisselø G.G. Schafer-Nielsen C. Surface immunoglobulin on B lymphocytes as a potential target for specific peptide ligands in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia.Br. J.

Moreover, we demonstrated recently that high affinity, non-peptidic, and serum-stable ligands for a CLL BCR can be discovered via combinatorial library screening (9.Sarkar M. Liu Y. Morimoto J. Peng H. Aquino C. Rader C. Chiorazzi N. Kodadek T. Recognition of antigen-specific B cell receptors chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients by synthetic “antigen surrogates”.Chem. Biol. 2014; 21: 1670-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These studies support the feasibility of targeting CLL BCR for the development of highly selective drugs. However, there are at least two major questions that have yet to be addressed with respect to drugging CLL BCRs. First, would a BCR-targeted strategy necessitate the development of a unique compound for each patient? This is obviously impractical. Large-scale DNA sequencing studies of the variable regions of BCRs from thousands of CLL patients has revealed that about one-third of CLL cases are “stereotyped,” meaning that the complementarity determining region 3 (HCDR3) of the pathogenic BCRs has significant homology to the CDR3s of CLL BCRs from other patients (10.Agathangelidis A. Darzentas N. Hadzidimitriou A. Brochet X. Murray F. Yan X.J. Davis Z. van Gastel-Mol E.J. Tresoldi C. Chu C.C. Cahill N. Giudicelli V. Tichy B. Pedersen L.B. Foroni L. et al.Stereotyped B-cell receptors in one-third of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: a molecular classification with implications for targeted therapies.Blood. 2012; 119: 4467-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 11.Agathangelidis A. Vardi A. Baliakas P. Stamatopoulos K. Stereotyped B-cell receptors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.Leuk. Lymphoma. 2014; 55: 2252-2261Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Indeed, patients exist whose entire IGHV-D-J amino acid sequences are identical, and some of these have remarkably identical IGκ/λV-Jκ/λ rearrangements. Thus, a critical question is whether a single compound could be identified that would cross-react with the BCRs of most or all of the patients falling into a particular stereotyped subset. Second, the clinically most aggressive cases of CLL, where the need for new therapies is greatest, usually display so-called “IGHV-unmutated” (U-CLL) BCRs, defined as having a specific Ig variable region gene (IGHV) sequence differing less than 2% from the germ line (2.Chiorazzi N. Rai K.R. Ferrarini M. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia.N. Engl. J. Med. 2005; 352: 804-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar, 12.Chiorazzi N. Ferrarini M. Cellular origin(s) of chronic lymphocytic leukemia: cautionary notes and additional considerations and possibilities.Blood. 2011; 117: 1781-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). There is reason to believe that unmutated BCRs would be more challenging drug targets than BCRs that have undergone more extensive somatic mutation. This is because unmutated pockets are thought to be more flexible and dynamic (13.Adhikary R. Yu W. Oda M. Walker R.C. Chen T. Stanfield R.L. Wilson I.A. Zimmermann J. Romesberg F.E. Adaptive mutations alter antibody structure and dynamics during affinity maturation.Biochemistry. 2015; 54: 2085-2093Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 14.Adhikary R. Yu W. Oda M.

Chem. 2012; 287: 27139-27147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), which is consistent with reports that U-CLL BCRs exhibit significant polyreactivity (7.Liu Y. Higgins C.D. Overstreet C.M. Rai K.R. Chiorazzi N. Lai J.R.

Med. 2008; 14: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and that previous attempts to identify peptide ligands for these receptors have only yielded low affinity molecules (7.Liu Y. Higgins C.D. Overstreet C.M. Rai K.R. Chiorazzi N. Lai J.R. Peptides that bind specifically to an antibody from a chronic lymphocytic leukemia clone expressing unmutated immunoglobulin variable region genes.Mol. Med. 2013; 19: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In this study, we probe these issues. We report the discovery of selective, high affinity synthetic ligands for the BCR of a patient from stereotyped subset 7P (10.Agathangelidis A. Darzentas N. Hadzidimitriou A. Brochet X. Murray F. Yan X.J. Davis Z. van Gastel-Mol E.J. Tresoldi C. Chu C.C. Cahill N. Giudicelli V. Tichy B. Pedersen L.B.

These ligands were tested for binding to BCRs from other patients of the same stereotyped subset and BCRs from CLL patients outside of that subset. Gratifyingly, there is excellent cross-reactivity between the ligand and all of the 7P stereotype CLL BCRs, but not between the ligand and BCRs outside of that stereotyped subset. The CLL BCR ligands also do not bind detectably to healthy B-cells or T-cells. These data strongly support the idea that the development of BCR-targeted reagents for the treatment of most or all CLL patients of a given stereotyped subset is a tractable goal. Full details of all the experimental procedures not presented below are provided under supplemental “Materials and Methods.” The one bead one compound combinatorial library was synthesized on 90-μm TentaGel MB NH2 resin (0.28 mmol/g loading, ∼2.8 million beads/g, from Rapp Polymere, Germany). The general schematic design of the branched library, side chain diversity elements (primary amines), and carboxylic acids used are shown in Fig. 1. Details are provided in the supplementary information (supplemental Figs. S1 and S2). To determine efficient synthesis of each library member, 24 random beads were isolated from the library and treated individually with 20 μl of CNBr solution to release the compounds. The parent ion mass of the compounds was determined by MALDI-TOF and the sequence of the unknown compound was determined by multiple sequence-specific product ions obtained from ESI Linear Ion Trap Mass Spectrometer coupled to electron transfer dissociation (LTQ-ETD, ThermoFinnigan) and 4800Plus MALDI-Tof/Tof (ABSciex). The TentaGel beads displaying a 4-azidoproline-branched oligomeric library were pre-blocked with 1× TBST Starting Block containing 3% BSA before incubating with 100 nm pooled human IgG (Sigma) and goat F(ab′)2 anti-human IgG Qdot 655 (Life Technologies) for 45 min at room temperature. The general scheme of the multistep screening processes is shown in Fig. 1. The beads were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX-51) equipped with a 10× DAPI filter and any bead emitting red light was collected manually by a micropipette and discarded. The denuded COPA library beads were incubated with 100 nm purified CLL 014 mAb in binding buffer (Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, 0.05% Tween 20, 1% BSA) for 45 min at room temperature followed by incubating with a 1:500 dilution of goat F(ab′)2 anti-human IgG Qdot for 45 min at room temperature. A total of 83 beads emitting red fluorescent (brightly fluorescent) light were collected manually using a micropipette. Beads were stripped of any bound proteins and the screening process mentioned above was repeated. From the final rounds of the selection process a total of 19 re-validated hit beads were identified. The individual hit beads were treated with 20 μl of CNBr solution overnight to release the compounds and the sequence of the compounds were elucidated by MS and tandem MS/MS using 4800Plus MALDI-Tof Analyzer and LTQ-Orbitrap equipped with ETD (supplemental Figs. S2 and S3). Hit compounds were synthesized with a free cysteine molecule in the invariable linker (for fluorescein or biotin conjugation) and purified on HPLC using C18 reverse phase column (supplemental Figs. S4). A control compound with a similar branched backbone with random side chains was also synthesized and purified on HPLC (supplemental Fig. S4, bottom panel). Fluorescence polarization experiments were carried out using 50 nm of probe compound and serially diluted CLL 014 mAb in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.6, 1% BSA) in a 384-well microtiter plate. Fluorescence polarization (mP units) was measured on a Tecan Microplate Reader (Infinite 200Pro). For ELISA, biotin-tagged compounds and controls were immobilized on a streptavidin- or neutravidin-coated 96-well microtiter plate and titrated with increasing concentrations of CLL mAbs for 45 min at room temperature, followed by a 1:5,000 (1-Step Ultra TMB ELISA substrate) or 1:20,000 (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate, Thermo Scientific) dilution of IgG1-conjugated HRP (Southern Biotech) for 30 min at room temperature. After developing plates, the data were recorded on a Tecan Microplate Reader (Infinite 200Pro). Binding kinetics of various CLL IgGs with synthetic ligands were analyzed by BLI using an Octet RED96 system (Pall ForteBio). The highest affinity compounds, KMS31 and KMS32, were synthesized with biotin at the linker and immobilized on streptavidin sensors. The kinetic measurements were carried out by exposing sensors with serially diluted soluble CLL IgGs in binding buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% BSA) in wells of a 96-well microtiter plate. The association and dissociation profiles of the compounds were monitored at 30 °C. Binding curves were analyzed by global fitting of sensorgrams to a bivalent binding model using data analysis software provided by Pall ForteBio. Cryopreserved PBMCs from CLL patients from stereotyped subset 7P (CLL 014, CLL 529, CLL 675, and CLL 1297) and from a other non-subset 7P patients were thawed and cultured in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FBS for 2 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Re-suspended PBMCs in 1× PBS were carefully passed through a density gradient using Ficoll-Paque Plus (from GE Healthcare) to remove dead cells. Approximately, 0.4 × 106 PBMCs from each CLL patient (CLL 014, CLL 529, CLL 675, CLL 1297, and CLL 3006) and from MEC1 cell line cells (DSMZ) were placed in each well of a 96-well microtiter plate for binding assays. The cells were pre-blocked with 3% BSA in 1× PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide and incubated with dextran-conjugated KMS31, KMS32, and control compounds (biotin-dextran, control compounds conjugated to dextran) in a 40 nm concentration for 40 min at 4 °C in binding buffer (1× PBS, pH 7.4, containing 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide). Following washing, cells were treated with SA-PE (to monitor binding), anti-human CD5-APC antibody, and anti-human CD19-FITC antibody (to identify CD5+/CD19+ CLL B-cell populations), and Po-Pro dye (for the staining of dead cells) for 30 min in the dark on ice. Selective staining of leukemic B-cells (CD5+/CD19+ populations) by multivalent compounds, dext-KMS31 and dext-KMS32, was detected by SA-PE signaling on flow cytometry (BD LSR II). We set as our target BCRs that belong to stereotype 7P, an example of U-CLL BCRs. After expressing the soluble form of the BCR from a patient in this sub-type (CLL 014) as an IgG in HEK 293T cells, the antibody was exposed to a one bead one compound library of molecules displayed on 90-μm TentaGel beads as a way to identify ligands for the antigen-specific binding site. The theoretical diversity of this library was just under one million compounds. As shown in Fig. 1, following a common linker, the variable region of the library contains two peptoid residues followed by a branch point derived from 4-azidoproline, from which two “arms” were constructed that contain units designed to impose conformational constraints (16.Aquino C.

Sarkar and T. Kodadek, unpublished data. Screening was conducted largely as described previously (9.Sarkar M. Liu Y. Morimoto J. Peng H. Aquino C. Rader C. Chiorazzi N. Kodadek T.

Biol. 2014; 21: 1670-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The library was first cleansed of beads that display ligands to the conserved regions of IgG antibodies or to antigen-binding sites of non-CLL antibodies. To do so, the beads were pre-blocked in 3% BSA and exposed to commercially available human total IgG, followed by anti-human IgG Fc antibody conjugated to red-emitting quantum dots. After thorough washing, the beads were examined under a fluorescent microscope and those that exhibited an obvious red halo were removed from the population manually using a micropipette (Fig. 1). The remainder of the library was then incubated with 100 nm soluble CLL 014 mAb. After another wash, the beads were incubated with labeled secondary antibody for visualization under the fluorescent microscope. A total of 83 brightly fluorescent beads were picked as putative hits. Given the propensity of this procedure to yield false positives (19.Lian W. Upadhyaya P. Rhodes C.A. Liu Y. Pei D.

The utility of redundant combinatorial libraries in distinguishing high and low quality screening hits.ACS Comb. Sci. 2014; 16: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), these beads were carried through another cycle of screening. First, the beads were washed with a denaturing buffer to remove any bound protein. After re-equilibration in a native buffer, the 83 beads were re-exposed to pooled human IgG and secondary antibody. Any beads that acquired a red fluorescent halo were discarded. The rest of the beads were incubated with CLL 014 mAb and subsequently with a secondary antibody. This final step of screening resulted in a total of 19 beads that fluoresced brightly. These beads were considered potential hits. Next, these beads were placed in individual wells of a 96-well plate and treated with CNBr to release the compounds into solution via cleavage of the methionine residue in the conserved linker (Fig. 1). The molecules were analyzed by a combination of MALDI-TOF/TOF and ESI/LTQ-ETD mass spectrometry (21.Sarkar M. Pascal B.D. Steckler C. Aquino C. Micalizio G.C. Kodadek T. Chalmers M.J.

Mass Spectrom. 2013; 24: 1026-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). From these data, the structures of 11 hits were elucidated unambiguously (supplemental Fig. S3). All of these compounds were re-synthesized and purified by HPLC (supplemental Fig. S4). In each case, a C-terminal cysteine was included to facilitate site-specific labeling with fluorescein or biotin for fluorescence polarization experiments or surface immobilization. To examine binding of the hits to the CLL 014 IgG, both fluorescence anisotropy and ELISAs were employed. Fluorescein or biotin was conjugated to the C-terminal cysteine and the molecules were HPLC purified. The anisotropy data (Fig. 2) showed that many of the compounds exhibited low to moderate affinity for CLL 014 IgG, but three of the compounds, KMS30, KMS31, and KMS32, demonstrated relatively robust binding. The KD values of the ligand-CLL 014 IgG complexes derived from these plots ranged from 70 to 200 nm with KMS31 being the highest affinity ligand (KD = 67 ± 11 nm). The ELISA experiments using the biotinylated compounds immobilized on streptavidin-coated plates showed the same trend (Fig. 2). To further explore the association and dissociation properties of the complexes of CLL 014 IgG with KMS31 and KMS32, we carried out BLI experiments using the Octet Red96 System. Streptavidin sensors were coated with biotinylated KMS31 or KMS32 and these were dipped into wells containing varying concentrations of soluble CLL 014 Ig to monitor association and dissociation kinetics (Fig. 3). The binding affinities measured (KD) from the association and dissociation sensograms are shown in Table 1. KMS31 exhibited the highest affinity for CLL 014 Ig (KD = 51 ± 11 nm), which was in good agreement with the ELISA data. The kinetic association and dissociation constants were 2.44 × 104 m−1 s−1 and 1.25 × 10−3 s−1, respectively. Under these conditions, the half-life of the complex was ∼550 s.TABLE 1Binding affinities and association and dissociation kinetic parameters determined by ELISA and Biolayer interferometry assay (Octet) for synthetic ligands (KmS31 and KmS32) against CLL 014 BCR IgLigandsELISA KDOctetkonkoffKDnm1/ms1/snmKmS3167 ± 132.44 × 1041.25 × 10−351 ± 11KmS32167 ± 397.98 × 1031.13 × 10−3141 ± 27 Open table in a new tab To examine the selectivity of these three ligands, the immobilized biotinylated species were titrated with CLL 014 IgG, or IgGs derived from CLL BCRs outside of subset 7P (CLL 068 and CLL 169) as well as total human IgG using the ELISA format. Note that CLL 068 uses the same unmutated IGHV as the selecting mAb CLL 014. As shown in Fig. 4, KMS31 and KMS32 exhibited good selectivity for binding to CLL 014 as opposed to other human antibodies. KMS30, on the other hand, showed comparatively higher “off target” binding to the other human IgGs, so further characterization efforts were focused on KMS31 and KMS32. To determine whether a similar level of selectivity is observed in a more native-like environment where the IgG is displayed on a cell surface, CLL 014, CLL 068, CLL 169, and CLL 183 IgGs were expressed on cells as surface immunoglobulins (smIg) by inserting a transmembrane anchoring domain at the C terminus of the heavy chain using methods described previously (9.Sarkar M.

HEK 293T cells were co-transfected with heavy and light chain expression vectors and the expression levels of surface membrane IgGs were determined by staining the cells with anti-human IgG Fc-specific antibody conjugated to allophycocyanin (anti-huIgFc-APC). Flow cytometry analysis confirmed expression of all 4 BCR IgGs of subset 7P on HEK 293T cells (supplemental Fig. S5). To assess binding of KMS31 and KMS32 to these cells, the ligands were conjugated to a biotinylated dextran polymer that displays an average of 20–30 ligands per polymer chain (9.Sarkar M. Liu Y.

They were then incubated with cells and binding was assayed by flow cytometry after staining with PE-conjugated streptavidin (Fig. 5). The dextran conjugates are employed in this type of experiment because the relatively rapid dissociation rate of the monomeric ligands (Fig. 3) preclude the use of flow cytometry for analysis of binding, as discussed previously (9.Sarkar M. Liu Y. Morimoto J. Peng H. Aquino C. Rader C. Chiorazzi N. Kodadek T. Recognition of antigen-specific B cell receptors chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients by synthetic “antigen surrogates”.Chem. Biol. 2014; 21: 1670-1679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The multivalent dextran conjugates provide strong avidity-driven, long-lived binding. As shown in Fig. 5, both of the dextran-conjugated compounds, dext-KMS31 and dext-KMS32, stained the cells only when they were expressing CLL 014 smIg. Much lower levels of binding were observed for cells expressing the other CLL smIgs not belonging to subset 7P, including CLL mAb068 that uses the same IGHV1–69. With selective ligands for the CLL 014 BCR in hand, we turned to the critical question of whether these compounds would recognize other BCRs in subset 7P. Biotinylated KMS31 or KMS32 were immobilized on a neutravidin-coated 96-well ELISA plate or streptavidin sensors (for Octet) and titrated with increasing amounts of soluble monoclonal IgGs that represent other BCRs from subset 7P (CLL 014, CLL 529, CLL 675, and CLL 1297; see Fig. 6 for the sequences of the CDR3s) or BCRs from CLL patients outside of subset 7P (CLL 169 and CLL 068). CLL 169 is a mutated, non-stereotyped CLL mAb, whereas CLL 068 is an unmutated CLL mAb from a different subset (subset 6) that nevertheless uses the same IGHV1–69 (8.Seiler T. Woelfle M.

A mixture of commercially available human IgG was used as an additional control. As shown in Fig. 7, the Octet and ELISA data show clearly that KMS31 and KMS32 recognized the subset 7P CLL IgGs to a much greater extent than IgGs outside of this subset. Quantitatively, the KD values of the complexes between KMS31 and the other subset 7P IgGs are ∼4- to 7-fold higher (weaker binding) compared with the KD of the KMS31-CLL 014 IgG complex (Fig. 8 and Table 2). For KMS32, the range was 2- to 3.5-fold. Most importantly, no significant binding was observed for either compound against the other non-subset 7P control U-CLL or M-CLL Igs and against polyclonal human IgG.FIGURE 7Reactivity of CLL 014 ligands with other CLL IgGs within same stereotypic subset.

https://openalex.org/W2291560455,"P5-ATPases are important for processes associated with the endosomal-lysosomal system of eukaryotic cells. In humans, the loss of function of P5-ATPases causes neurodegeneration. In the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae, deletion of P5-ATPase Spf1p gives rise to endoplasmic reticulum stress. The reaction cycle of P5-ATPases is poorly characterized. Here, we showed that the formation of the Spf1p catalytic phosphoenzyme was fast in a reaction medium containing ATP, Mg(2+), and EGTA. Low concentrations of Ca(2+)in the phosphorylation medium decreased the rate of phosphorylation and the maximal level of phosphoenzyme. Neither Mn(2+)nor Mg(2+)had an inhibitory effect on the formation of the phosphoenzyme similar to that of Ca(2+) TheKmfor ATP in the phosphorylation reaction was ∼1 μmand did not significantly change in the presence of Ca(2+) Half-maximal phosphorylation was attained at 8 μmMg(2+), but higher concentrations partially protected from Ca(2+)inhibition. In conditions similar to those used for phosphorylation, Ca(2+)had a small effect accelerating dephosphorylation and minimally affected ATPase activity, suggesting that the formation of the phosphoenzyme was not the limiting step of the ATP hydrolytic cycle."
https://openalex.org/W2263539672,"The photosynthetic bradyrhizobia are able to use a Nod-factor independent process to induce nitrogen-fixing nodules on some semi-aquatic Aeschynomene species. These bacteria display a unique LPS O-antigen composed of a new sugar, the bradyrhizose that is regarded as a key symbiotic factor due to its non-immunogenic character. In this study, to check this hypothesis, we isolated mutants affected in the O-antigen synthesis by screening a transposon mutant library of the ORS285 strain for clones altered in colony morphology. Over the 10,000 mutants screened, five were selected and found to be mutated in two genes, rfaL, encoding for a putative O-antigen ligase and gdh encoding for a putative dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase. Biochemical analysis confirmed that the LPS of these mutants completely lack the O-antigen region. However, no effect of the mutations could be detected on the symbiotic properties of the mutants indicating that the O-antigen region of photosynthetic Bradyrhizobium strains is not required for the establishment of symbiosis with Aeschynomene."
https://openalex.org/W2269054865,"Leptin resistance is considered to be the primary cause of obesity. However, the cause of leptin resistance remains incompletely understood, and there is currently no cure for the leptin-resistant state. In order to identify novel drug-target molecules that could overcome leptin resistance, it would be useful to develop in vitro assay systems for evaluating leptin resistance. In this study, we established immortalized adult mouse hypothalamus-derived cell lines, termed adult mouse hypothalamus (AMH) cells, by developing transgenic mice in which SV40 Tag was overexpressed in chromogranin A-positive cells in a tamoxifen-dependent manner. In order to obtain leptin-responsive clones, we selected clones based on the phosphorylation levels of STAT3 induced by leptin. The selected clones were fairly responsive to leptin in terms of STAT3, ERK, and Akt phosphorylation and induction of c-Fos mRNA induction. Pretreatment with leptin, insulin, and palmitate attenuated the c-Fos mRNA response to leptin, suggesting that certain aspects of leptin resistance might be reconstituted in this cellular model. These cell lines are useful tools for understanding the molecular nature of the signal disturbance in the leptin-resistant state and for identifying potential target molecules for drugs that relieve leptin resistance, although they have drawbacks including de-differentiated nature and lack of long-time stability."
