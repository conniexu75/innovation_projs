https://openalex.org/W1999661963,"YAP (Yes-associated protein) is a transcription co-activator in the Hippo tumour suppressor pathway and controls cell growth, tissue homeostasis and organ size. YAP is inhibited by the kinase Lats, which phosphorylates YAP to induce its cytoplasmic localization and proteasomal degradation. YAP induces gene expression by binding to the TEAD family transcription factors. Dysregulation of the Hippo-YAP pathway is frequently observed in human cancers. Here we show that cellular energy stress induces YAP phosphorylation, in part due to AMPK-dependent Lats activation, thereby inhibiting YAP activity. Moreover, AMPK directly phosphorylates YAP Ser 94, a residue essential for the interaction with TEAD, thus disrupting the YAP-TEAD interaction. AMPK-induced YAP inhibition can suppress oncogenic transformation of Lats-null cells with high YAP activity. Our study establishes a molecular mechanism and functional significance of AMPK in linking cellular energy status to the Hippo-YAP pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2020511240,"The Hippo pathway was discovered as a conserved tumour suppressor pathway restricting cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, the upstream signals that regulate the Hippo pathway in the context of organ size control and cancer prevention are largely unknown. Here, we report that glucose, the ubiquitous energy source used for ATP generation, regulates the Hippo pathway downstream effector YAP. We show that both the Hippo pathway and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were activated during glucose starvation, resulting in phosphorylation of YAP and contributing to its inactivation. We also identified glucose-transporter 3 (GLUT3) as a YAP-regulated gene involved in glucose metabolism. Together, these results demonstrate that glucose-mediated energy homeostasis is an upstream event involved in regulation of the Hippo pathway and, potentially, an oncogenic function of YAP in promoting glycolysis, thereby providing an exciting link between glucose metabolism and the Hippo pathway in tissue maintenance and cancer prevention. In two related papers, Chen and colleagues and Guan and colleagues report a crucial role for the AMPK and Hippo pathways in glucose homeostasis. Starvation triggers AMPK-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of YAP."

Lysine deacetylases inhibitors (KDACIs) are used in basic research, and many are being investigated in clinical trials for treatment of cancer and other diseases. However, their specificities in cells are incompletely characterized. Here we used quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) to obtain acetylation signatures for 19 different KDACIs, covering all 18 human lysine deacetylases. Most KDACIs increased acetylation of a small, specific subset of the acetylome, including sites on histones and other chromatin-associated proteins. Inhibitor treatment combined with genetic deletion showed that the effects of the pan-sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide are primarily mediated by SIRT1 inhibition. Furthermore, we confirmed that the effects of tubacin and bufexamac on cytoplasmic proteins result from inhibition of HDAC6. Bufexamac also triggered an HDAC6-independent, hypoxia-like response by stabilizing HIF1-α, providing a possible mechanistic explanation of its adverse, pro-inflammatory effects. Our results offer a systems view of KDACI specificities, providing a framework for studying function of acetylation and deacetylases."

Understanding how eukaryotic enhancers are bound and regulated by specific combinations of transcription factors is still a major challenge. To better map transcription factor binding genome-wide at nucleotide resolution in vivo, we have developed a robust ChIP-exo protocol called ChIP-nexus (chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments with nucleotide resolution through exonuclease, unique barcode and single ligation), which utilizes an efficient DNA self-circularization step during library preparation. Application of ChIP-nexus to four proteins—human TBP and Drosophila NFkB, Twist and Max—shows that it outperforms existing ChIP protocols in resolution and specificity, pinpoints relevant binding sites within enhancers containing multiple binding motifs, and allows for the analysis of in vivo binding specificities. Notably, we show that Max frequently interacts with DNA sequences next to its motif, and that this binding pattern correlates with local DNA-sequence features such as DNA shape. ChIP-nexus will be broadly applicable to the study of in vivo transcription factor binding specificity and its relationship to cis-regulatory changes in humans and model organisms."

Reprogramming somatic cells to a pluripotent state by forced expression of transcription factors is a dynamic process. How a somatic cell successfully undergoes this transition is poorly understood because low efficiencies, long latency times, and asynchronous progression impede molecular analysis (Hanna et al., 2009Hanna J. Saha K. Pando B. van Zon J. Lengner C.J. Creyghton M.P. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R.

Characterization of bulk populations over time has given insight into how entire reprogramming populations progress (Li et al., 2010Li R. Liang J. Ni S. Zhou T. Qing X. Li H. He W. Chen J. Li F.

To address these concerns, several groups have sought to identify and characterize productive reprogramming populations. An early role for transgene stoichiometry was deduced from transgene integrations in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and by sorting fibroblasts according to transgene expression levels (Papapetrou et al., 2009Papapetrou E.P. Tomishima M.J. Chambers S.M. Mica Y. Reed E. Menon J. Tabar V. Mo Q. Studer L. Sadelain M.

Sox2low, Oct4high, Klf4high was found to be an optimal combination and was further verified with polycistronic constructs expressing different transgene stoichiometries (Carey et al., 2009Carey B.W. Markoulaki S. Hanna J. Saha K. Gao Q. Mitalipova M. Jaenisch R. Reprogramming of murine and human somatic cells using a single polycistronic vector.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Single-cell time-lapse imaging analysis revealed an early proliferation phenotype (Koche et al., 2011Koche R.P. Smith Z.D. Adli M.

Early work suggested the progression of reprogramming states with sequential acquisition of the pluripotency markers alkaline phosphatase, SSEA1, Nanog, and Oct4 (Stadtfeld et al., 2008Stadtfeld M.

Defining molecular cornerstones during fibroblast to iPS cell reprogramming in mouse.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 230-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Additionally, repression of the fibroblast marker Thy1 and loss of retroviral expression was observed to occur early in the process. Characterization of these states suggested two waves of reprogramming occur with the first being mediated by c-Myc and Klf4 and the second by Oct4, Sox2, and Klf4 (Polo et al., 2012Polo J.M.

Stable partially reprogrammed lines have also been isolated and characterized (Chen et al., 2013Chen J. Liu H. Liu J. Qi J. Wei B. Yang J. Liang H. Chen Y. Chen J.

These partially reprogrammed cells arise late in the process but prior to the acquisition of pluripotency and can be derived from multiple reprogramming populations including fibroblasts, neural stem cells, and B cells (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S.

Morphologically they resemble iPSCs, but have not acquired pluripotency as shown by their inability to form teratomas and dependence on the reprogramming transgenes (Wernig et al., 2008Wernig M. Lengner C.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Steine E. Foreman R. Staerk J. Markoulaki S. Jaenisch R. A drug-inducible transgenic system for direct reprogramming of multiple somatic cell types.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 916-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Although the majority of these cells do not acquire pluripotency under standard conditions, they can be pushed to a pluripotent state with chemical treatment of 5-aza-cytidine and vitamin C or by overexpression of Nanog, suggesting that they resemble an intermediate state where roadblocks inhibit pluripotency acquisition (Mikkelsen et al., 2008Mikkelsen T.S.

Biol. 2011; 21: 65-71Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Although characterization of enriched intermediates has been useful, analysis is still highly reliant on bulk populations where heterogeneity is still prevalent. Recently, Buganim et al., 2012Buganim Y. Faddah D.A. Cheng A.W. Itskovich E. Markoulaki S. Ganz K. Klemm S.L. van Oudenaarden A. Jaenisch R. Single-cell expression analyses during cellular reprogramming reveal an early stochastic and a late hierarchic phase.Cell. 2012; 150: 1209-1222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar attempted to address this by conducting single-cell mRNA analysis to identify an early stochastic phase of reprogramming followed by a late deterministic phase correlated with Sox2 expression. Despite the importance of the findings in this study, its conclusions may have been limited by the relatively small sample size of 96 cells that were assayed at each time point, coupled with low reprogramming efficiencies where only two in 100 cells may successfully reprogram. To this end, we have characterized the reprogramming process by single-cell mass cytometry, a flow cytometry technique that uses rare earth metal isotopes for antibody labeling and detection (Bandura et al., 2009Bandura D.R. Baranov V.I. Ornatsky O.I. Antonov A. Kinach R. Lou X. Pavlov S. Vorobiev S. Dick J.E. Tanner S.D. Mass cytometry: technique for real time single cell multitarget immunoassay based on inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry.Anal. Chem. 2009; 81: 6813-6822Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Mass cytometry produces results that are essentially identical to conventional fluorescent flow cytometry (Bendall et al., 2011Bendall S.C. Simonds E.F. Qiu P. Amir A.D. Krutzik P.O. Finck R. Bruggner R.V. Melamed R. Trejo A. Ornatsky O.I. et al.Single-cell mass cytometry of differential immune and drug responses across a human hematopoietic continuum.Science. 2011; 332: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar), but allows over 40 different parameters to be measured simultaneously at ∼500 cells per second. Using mass cytometry, we have analyzed three different reprogramming lines during the first 3–4 weeks of reprogramming. Time-resolved, high-dimensional progression analysis of the mass cytometry data sets facilitated construction of continuous molecular maps of reprogramming, which should serve as valuable resources for the continued development of improved iPSC reprogramming protocols. Three cellular reprogramming systems were used for this study: (1) Oct4-GFP primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that express GFP from the endogenous Oct4 locus (Lengner et al., 2007Lengner C.J. Camargo F.D. Hochedlinger K. Welstead G.G. Zaidi S. Gokhale S. Scholer H.R. Tomilin A. Jaenisch R. Oct4 expression is not required for mouse somatic stem cell self-renewal.Cell Stem Cell. 2007; 1: 403-415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), (2) Nanog-Neo secondary MEFs that express the neomycin resistance gene from the endogenous Nanog locus (Wernig et al., 2008Wernig M. Lengner C.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Steine E. Foreman R. Staerk J. Markoulaki S. Jaenisch R. A drug-inducible transgenic system for direct reprogramming of multiple somatic cell types.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 916-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), and (3) Nanog-GFP secondary MEFs that expresses GFP from the endogenous Nanog locus (Wernig et al., 2008Wernig M. Lengner C.J. Hanna J. Lodato M.A. Steine E. Foreman R. Staerk J. Markoulaki S. Jaenisch R. A drug-inducible transgenic system for direct reprogramming of multiple somatic cell types.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 916-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). To obtain a comprehensive view of cellular reprogramming in the three MEF systems, cell samples were collected on every other day of the reprogramming time course. The reprogramming regimen consisted of Dox induction for 16 days followed by Dox withdrawal and the addition of LIF (Figure 1A). Additional samples were collected on days 1 and 17, as these days represent points of significant transition in the reprogramming process, immediately after Dox induction and Dox withdrawal, respectively. Samples were collected over 20 days for the primary Oct4-GFP MEFs, and the time course was extended to 30 days for the secondary Nanog-Neo and Nanog-GFP MEFs because the reprogramming process was found to be slower in these systems. At each collection time point, cell cultures were dissociated into a single-cell suspension, permeabilized (Krutzik et al., 2005Krutzik P.O. Clutter M.R. Nolan G.P. Coordinate analysis of murine immune cell surface markers and intracellular phosphoproteins by flow cytometry.J. Immunol. 2005; 175: 2357-2365Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and then multiplexed by Mass-tag Cell Barcoding (Bodenmiller et al., 2012Bodenmiller B. Zunder E.R. Finck R. Chen T.J. Savig E.S. Bruggner R.V. Simonds E.F. Bendall S.C. Sachs K. Krutzik P.O. Nolan G.P. Multiplexed mass cytometry profiling of cellular states perturbed by small-molecule regulators.Nat. Biotechnol. 2012; 30: 858-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) before antibody staining (Table S1) and mass cytometry analysis (Bendall et al., 2011Bendall S.C. Simonds E.F. Qiu P. Amir A.D. Krutzik P.O. Finck R. Bruggner R.V. Melamed R. Trejo A. Ornatsky O.I. et al.Single-cell mass cytometry of differential immune and drug responses across a human hematopoietic continuum.Science. 2011; 332: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). A six-metal barcoding scheme was used to encode 20 unique Mass-tag barcodes (Figure 1C) (Zunder et al., 2015Zunder E.R. Finck R. Behbehani G.K. Amir A.D. Krishnaswamy S. Gonzalez V.D. Lorang C.G. Bjornson Z. Spitzer M.H. Bodenmiller B. et al.Palladium-based mass tag cell barcoding with a doublet-filtering scheme and single-cell deconvolution algorithm.Nat. Protoc. 2015; 10: 316-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), allowing the entire time course for each MEF system to be pooled and stained within a single tube, eliminating tube-to-tube variability in antibody staining and minimizing the effect of variable instrument sensitivity. After mass cytometry measurement of the multiplexed samples, barcode deconvolution was performed to recover individual samples from the pooled data set (Figure 1D). Over the course of reprogramming, the MEF marker Thy1 decreased and the pluripotency marker SSEA1 increased (Figure 1E), in agreement with previous studies (Stadtfeld et al., 2008Stadtfeld M. Maherali N. Breault D.T. Hochedlinger K. Defining molecular cornerstones during fibroblast to iPS cell reprogramming in mouse.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 2: 230-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Elevated Nanog expression was not observed until after release from Dox-induced transgene expression on day 16 and correlated with expression of ICAM-1/CD54 (Figure 1F), a marker associated with successful cellular reprogramming (O’Malley et al., 2013O’Malley J. Skylaki S. Iwabuchi K.A. Chantzoura E. Ruetz T. Johnsson A. Tomlinson S.R. Linnarsson S. Kaji K. High-resolution analysis with novel cell-surface markers identifies routes to iPS cells.Nature. 2013; 499: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PDGFR-α was expressed by MEFs, depressed during the initial stages of reprogramming, and gradually returned during the later stages of reprogramming. One late-stage cell population expressed PDGFR-α at a higher level than seen in the uninduced MEFs, and another Lin28-expressing population expressed PDGFR-α at an intermediate level (Figure 1G).

Thomas G. Ribosomal S6 kinase signaling and the control of translation.Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar) decreased rapidly (Figure 1H), indicating a stress-related response to forced expression of the four transcription factors (Feng et al., 2005Feng Z. Zhang H. Levine A.J. Jin S. The coordinate regulation of the p53 and mTOR pathways in cells.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2005; 102: 8204-8209Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Hierarchical clustering identified MEF-like markers that decreased over time, transitional markers that appeared at intermediate time points, and ESC-like markers that appeared during the latest stages of reprogramming (Figures S1A–S1D). Replicate analysis (Figure S1E) indicated these observed trends are reproducible. While hierarchical clustering provides a useful overview of the data sets, this approach does not take advantage of the single-cell nature of the data and is not well suited for analysis of low abundance populations. Therefore, additional methods were employed to better exploit the single-cell nature of the three reprogramming time course data sets. Spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events (SPADE) has proven useful in identifying relationships between cell types in high-dimensional space, by downsampling to uniform density (Figures 2A and 2B ), hierarchical clustering (Figure 2C), and connecting the resulting clusters with a minimum spanning tree (MST) (Figure 2D) that can be visualized in two dimensions (Figure 2E) to reveal high-dimensional relationships between cell types (Bendall et al., 2011Bendall S.C.

Biotechnol. 2011; 29: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar). The MST used by SPADE is susceptible to overfitting the data and is not robust to local variation (Figures 2D and 2E). To improve the ability of the SPADE algorithm to robustly identify high-dimensional relationships between cell types, the MST was replaced with a more highly connected graph structure, where the number of connections between cell clusters is determined by local density (Figure 2F). This new graph structure is then employed to produce a force-directed layout of a weighted graph containing multidimensional agglomeratively clustered points (FLOW-MAP) plot. The FLOW-MAP layout of cell clusters is more reproducible than a MST-derived layout, because the underlying graph structure is highly connected and therefore less susceptible to local edge and cluster variability (Figure 2G). To facilitate comparison between the three reprogramming systems, each timed sample was clustered individually and then combined into a single FLOW-MAP graph (Figure 2H). Cell clusters from two mESC samples and a partially reprogrammed iPSC line were also included as reference points. As expected, the three MEF systems occupied a similar high-dimensional space before Dox induction, characterized by high expression of MEF markers such as Thy1 (Figure 2I), PDGFRα, and MEFSK4 (Figure S2). Late in the reprogramming process, all three culture systems contained ESC-like cell populations that expressed high levels of non-transgene markers of pluripotency such as SSEA1, Lin28, and Nanog (Figures 2J–2L). These ESC-like populations formed distinct groups in the combined FLOW-MAP layout that may represent metastable pluripotent states (Hayashi et al., 2008Hayashi K. Lopes S.M.C. de S. Tang F. Surani M.A. Dynamic equilibrium and heterogeneity of mouse pluripotent stem cells with distinct functional and epigenetic states.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar) or may be unique stages on the path to a pluripotent “ground state” (Ying et al., 2008Ying Q.-L.

The ground state of embryonic stem cell self-renewal.Nature. 2008; 453: 519-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). These populations vary mainly between high-level and mid-level expression of pluripotency markers and group closely in the graph with the mESC control samples. SPADE and the FLOW-MAP algorithm draw connections between populations that are similar in n-dimensional space, but cannot utilize the temporal information present in time course data sets. To exploit this temporal information, the FLOW-MAP algorithm was extended to include multiple graph drawing steps, where cell clusters are added to the graph sequentially for each time point (Figures 3A, 3B , and S3A–S3C). In this scheme, only cell clusters that reside in identical or adjacent time points may be connected in the final FLOW-MAP graph. Display of the resulting x-y layouts with time on the z axis in a 3D environment such as PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org) (Figure 3C) allows simultaneous visualization of experimental time point along with additional markers (Supplemental Files 1, 2, and 3). Time-resolved FLOW-MAP analysis revealed several similarities between the Oct4-GFP, Nanog-Neo, and Nanog-GFP MEF reprogramming systems (Figures 3D–3F), as well as two additional reprogramming time course experiments (Figures S3D and S3E). After Dox induction, all three systems contain populations with mixed stoichiometry of the four reprogramming factors, and the Oct4-GFP and Nanog-Neo MEFs contained a sizable proportion of cells that do not express any of the four reprogramming factors at the protein level. The reprogramming factor non-expressing FLOW-MAP branches show increased PDGFR-a and CD54/ICAM-1 expression at later time points, behavior also observed in uninfected mock-reprogramming MEF cultures (Figure S3F). An Oct4highKlf4high population emerged from the mixed stoichiometry population in the FLOW-MAP plot of each of the three reprogramming systems. This population immediately precedes a partially reprogrammed state in the FLOW-MAP plot, which in turn extends to the mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET). Ki67low cells appeared to revert to a MEF-like state, while proliferative Ki67high cells appeared to transition into a Nanoghigh population. At the end of the reprogramming time course, the Nanoghigh population diverged into two major end-stage populations in the FLOW-MAP plot: one that was ESC-like with high levels of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog protein expression, and another state that was Lin28high but low in Sox2 and Nanog protein expression, which represents a state immunophenotypically similar to multipotent mesendodermal progenitor cells (Tada et al., 2005Tada S.

Neural crest (NC) cells are a defining feature of vertebrates that give rise to many of the cell types that imbue them with their unique characteristics, such as jaws and peripheral nervous system. In the embryo, NC cells arise from the dorsal margin of the neural plate border during neurulation (Le Douarin et al., 2008Le Douarin N.M. Calloni G.W. Dupin E. The stem cells of the neural crest.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), and migrate extensively throughout the embryo to populate numerous derivatives. This has raised the important question of what underlies this remarkable ability to contribute to so many diverse derivatives, ranging from craniofacial cartilage to neurons and glia to melanocytes. One model suggests that the entire NC cell population is “multipotent” and capable of forming many or all of the potential derivatives. At the opposite extreme, the NC might instead represent a heterogeneous mixture of “predetermined” cells, each fated to form a particular derivative. Finally, the NC may be comprised of a mixture of these two types of precursor cells. Over several decades, there has been considerable controversy regarding the correct answer to this pivotal question (Dupin and Sommer, 2012Dupin E. Sommer L. Neural crest progenitors and stem cells: from early development to adulthood.Dev. Biol. 2012; 366: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Early studies concluded that NC cells were multipotent in vivo (Bronner-Fraser and Fraser, 1988Bronner-Fraser M. Fraser S.E.

However, other publications instead reported that the NC was comprised of heterogeneous populations of restricted progenitor cells (Harris and Erickson, 2007Harris M.L. Erickson C.A.

Evidence for a dynamic spatiotemporal fate map and early fate restrictions of premigratory avian neural crest.Development. 2010; 137: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In particular, recent studies proposed that premigratory NC cells are fate determined prior to delamination and organized according to a spatio-temporal pattern in the dorsal neural tube (dNT) of chick embryos (Krispin et al., 2010Krispin S. Nitzan E. Kassem Y. Kalcheim C.

A dynamic code of dorsal neural tube genes regulates the segregation between neurogenic and melanogenic neural crest cells.Development. 2013; 140: 2269-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this model, each NC cell gives rise only to a specific cell type, depending on the timing of emigration and the site of origin in the dNT. Despite technical differences potentially explaining these discrepancies, it has so far not been possible to reconcile these studies (Dupin and Sommer, 2012Dupin E. Sommer L. Neural crest progenitors and stem cells: from early development to adulthood.Dev. Biol. 2012; 366: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Early in vivo lineage tracing studies lacked the ability to identify specific cell types other than by location in various derivatives. Whereas clonal analysis in vitro circumvents these problems, the culture techniques analyze cells outside of their endogenous environment and expose cells to culture media, which may alter cell behavior. Moreover, there is very little information regarding the developmental potential of NC cells in mammalian model systems. Lineage-tracing studies were originally performed in chicken embryos by vital dye injection, which is very challenging to carry out in mouse embryos (Serbedzija et al., 1990Serbedzija G.N. Fraser S.E. Bronner-Fraser M. Pathways of trunk neural crest cell migration in the mouse embryo as revealed by vital dye labelling.Development. 1990; 108: 605-612PubMed Google Scholar). With the advent of modern transgenic technology, it is now possible to resolve the controversy regarding NC potentials in the mammalian embryo. Here, we use the R26R-Confetti mouse model to perform genetic in vivo fate mapping of NC cells. Our results definitively show that the vast majority of murine NC cells, both prior to and during migration, are multipotent. To achieve temporal tracing of NC cells, we used the CreER loxP system, by which activation of CreER recombinase can be induced in embryos in a cell type- and stage-dependent manner upon tamoxifen (TM) injection of pregnant females. CreER-mediated genomic recombination of reporter alleles leads to marker expression that can be tracked in CreER-expressing cells and all of their daughter cells, allowing fate mapping of these cells in vivo. To trace the fate of premigratory NC cells, we made use of Wnt1-CreERT animals. Accordingly, CreERT-induced β-galactosidase expression in Wnt1-CreERT embryos carrying the CreERT-reporter allele R26R-Rosa was observed in the dNT and in all NC derivatives (Figures 1A and 1B ) (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4158) Google Scholar, Zervas et al., 2004Zervas M. Millet S. Ahn S. Joyner A.L. Cell behaviors and genetic lineages of the mesencephalon and rhombomere 1.Neuron. 2004; 43: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To trace NC cells that have already emigrated from the dNT, we used the Sox10-CreERT2 line (Simon et al., 2012Simon C. Lickert H. Götz M. Dimou L. Sox10-iCreERT2 : a mouse line to inducibly trace the neural crest and oligodendrocyte lineage.Genesis. 2012; 50: 506-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the mouse, Sox10 expression follows Wnt1 expression and marks virtually all NC cells immediately after their delamination from the dNT (Hari et al., 2012Hari L. Miescher I. Shakhova O. Suter U. Chin L. Taketo M. Richardson W.D. Kessaris N. Sommer L. Temporal control of neural crest lineage generation by Wnt/β-catenin signaling.Development. 2012; 139: 2107-2117Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Therefore, TM-induced recombination at E.9.0 in Sox10-CreERT2 R26R-Rosa embryos resulted in β-galactosidase expression in all NC derivatives, but not the dNT (Figures 1C and 1D). Upon CreER activation and recombination across sets of loxP sites in the R26R-Confetti reporter mouse, one out of four fluorescent reporter proteins, nuclear GFP, cytoplasmic YFP, cytoplasmic RFP, or membrane-bound CFP, is expressed. To increase the colors available for the tracing, we used animals homozygous for the R26R-Confetti allele. In these animals, both alleles are recombined, which leads to expression of two out of the four available fluorescent proteins, allowing a total of 10 color combinations (Figure S1). In both Wnt1-CreERT R26R-Confetti (hereafter called Wnt1-CreERT) (Figures 1E–1J) and in Sox10-CreERT2 R26R-Confetti (Sox10-CreERT2) embryos (data not shown), expression of the following single color combinations was readily detectable: red (rfp, Figure 1E); yellow (yfp, Figure 1F); and blue (cfp, Figure 1G). In addition, we observed the expression of mixed color combinations, such as red and blue (rfp cfp, Figure 1H), red and yellow (rfp yfp, Figure 1I), and yellow and blue (yfp cfp, Figure 1J). In contrast, color combinations with the fluorescent protein GFP were extremely rare, indicating that not all theoretically possible color combinations were equally represented. The frequency of color combinations observed upon CreER-mediated recombination of a multicolor Cre reporter influences the probability of whether a cohort of cells marked by a single color derives from one or more founder cells. Therefore, we examined the frequency of different colors expressed in E10.5 R26R-Confetti embryos of both CreER lines (Figure 1K). A single limiting dose of TM resulted in few recombination events. Quantification of low-TM-dose-treated E10.5 Wnt1-CreERT R26R-Confetti embryos (Wnt1-CreERT low) revealed that the mixed color combinations were expressed in only 0.1%–0.9% of the recombined NC cells (Figure 1L; Table S1A). Similarly, in low-TM-dose-treated Sox10-CreERT2 R26R-Confetti embryos (Sox10-CreERT2 low), mixed colors were found at very low frequencies (Figure 1M; Table S1A). In contrast, the pure colors red, yellow, or blue were consistently expressed in recombined NC cells in both CreER lines (Figures 1L and 1M; Table S1A). These findings prompted us to increase the level of recombination for both CreER lines, in order to obtain more NC cells expressing rare color combinations. For the Wnt1-CreERT R26R-Confetti line, higher recombination density achieved by elevating the TM dose (Wnt1-CreERT high) resulted in increased, but still low, occurrence of the rare color combinations (0.3%–3.2% of all recombined cells) (Figure 1L; Table S1A). Similarly, elevating the TM concentration in the Sox10-CreERT2 R26R-Confetti line (Sox10-CreERT2 high) allowed increased representation of the mixed color combinations (1.0%–3.5%) (Figure 1M; Table S1A). Summarizing, in our system we were able to trace NC cells not only at two different developmental stages, namely at the premigratory and at the migratory stage, but also at two different recombination densities producing different color outputs. The most frequent color combinations allowed clonal tracing when only few recombination events occurred. Rare fluorescent marker combinations, on the other hand, could be used to discern single clones at both low and high recombination densities. NC cells in the trunk of mouse embryos give rise to several structures, such as dorsal root ganglia (DRG), Schwann cells associated with peripheral nerves as, for instance, evident in the ventral root (VR), sympathetic ganglia (SG), and finally cells that migrate along the dorsal lateral pathway (DLP) to generate melanocytes. As expected, all these derivatives were marked in Wnt1-CreERT and Sox10-CreERT2 embryos (Figures 2A–2F; data not shown). Moreover, tracing NC cells at the premigratory stage with the Wnt1-CreERT line allowed the observation of recombined cells in the dNT, which we defined as the most dorsal three cell layers of the neural tube (Figures 2A and 2B). The likelihood to detect daughter cells of a NC progenitor cell in different target structures is possibly dependent on the relative sizes of these structures: The bigger a given compartment, the more likely it might be for a daughter cell to end up in this compartment. In Wnt1-CreERT embryos, we observed 7.6%–14.0% of recombined cells in the dNT (Figure 2G; Table S1B), while no recombined cells were found in the dNT of Sox10-CreERT2 embryos. In all conditions, the majority of recombined cells were found in the biggest trunk NC derivative, the DRG (Figures 2C and 2G; Table S1B). The SG and the VR were populated by comparable numbers of recombined NC cells, while the DLP was the derivative with the lowest number of recombined cells (Figures 2D–2G; Table S1B). Given the number of possible cell divisions in a time window of 41 hr (Figure 1K), the elevated numbers of some recombined cells of the same color in certain derivatives cannot be explained only by differential proliferation in these derivatives. Therefore, the fact that the majority of recombined cells were present in the bigger derivatives is likely due to higher numbers of migratory NC cells populating these derivatives. Our data reveal that CreER-mediated recombination of the R26R-Confetti allele allows tracking of NC cells by different color combinations at defined frequencies. We next exploited this system to track the fate of individual NC cells, with a first emphasis on premigratory cells. E10.5 embryos were collected 41 hr post-TM injection (Figure 1K). As previously demonstrated, the mean cell-cycle length of E9.5 NC cells is 10.6 hr (Gonsalvez et al., 2013Gonsalvez D.G. Cane K.N. Landman K.A. Enomoto H. Young H.M. Anderson C.R. Proliferation and cell cycle dynamics in the developing stellate ganglion.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5969-5979Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The literature does not provide exact error intervals for the cell division rate, and it is likely that during 41 hr of NC development the cell-cycle length varies and becomes cell type and derivative specific. Since these variations are unknown and can hardly be determined, we first applied a fixed assumption that NC cells could divide three times between TM-induced recombination and the time point of analysis. Hence, we initially considered only equally colored cohorts of cells with a minimum of two and a maximum of eight cells, with the goal that such a stringent analysis would serve as a basis to establish and assess a statistical method able to discern between multipotency and cell fate restriction. For the analysis of putative clones, we focused on the forelimbs area, taking into account cells of the same color that were present in a unit defined by a trunk segment spanning the width of one DRG (10–14 transverse sections of 10 μm thickness each) (Figure S2; Movie S1). 3D reconstruction confirmed that our recombination protocol allowed marking of a small number of equally colored NC daughter cells disseminating over various trunk derivatives (Figure S2; Movie S1 and S2). Consecutive transverse sections at the level of the forelimbs were imaged (Figure S2Ai–S2Axii), and the number and location of equally colored recombined cells per trunk segment were assessed (Figure 3). For the different conditions used, the density of putative clones ranged between 0.8 ± 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.3 clones per unit, with most units analyzed containing 0 or 1 clone (Table S2A). Wnt1-CreERT low embryos displayed many putative clones with progeny in multiple derivatives, including sometimes the dNT and DLP (Figures 3A and S3A). To corroborate these results, we analyzed Wnt1-CreERT high embryos, in which we observed cohorts of cells (two to eight cells) expressing rare mixed color combinations (Figures 3A and S3C). Strikingly, putative clones were mostly spread over multiple derivatives (Figures 3A and S3C). Our findings prompted us to ask whether multipotency might be a unique characteristic of premigratory NC cells or whether this developmental potential is retained upon NC delamination and migration. Therefore, we analyzed the fate of NC cells in Sox10-CreERT2 embryos (Figure 1K). The clonal density found in Sox10-CreERT2 embryos was again low (Table S2A). Surprisingly, in Sox10-CreERT2 low embryos, many equally colored cell cohorts were dispersed over multiple NC derivatives, in a similar manner to what had been observed in Wnt1-CreERT embryos (Figures 3B and S3B). Similar results were acquired for the Sox10-CreERT2 high embryos, suggesting that these observations are independent of the recombination density and the color of the cell cohort (Figures 3B and S3D). Our observations suggested that the majority of NC cells are multipotent both at the premigratory stage and, intriguingly, also at the migratory stage. To verify our results, we analyzed each data set considering the color of the observed putative clone, the derivative where we observed it, and its size. Defining the exact cell-cycle length and its variation during a period of 41 hr for each specific derivative would have been extremely difficult and prone to mistakes. Thus, we applied a static framework instead of a complete dynamic modeling approach. To distinguish between a predetermined and a multipotent framework for both Wnt1-CreERT and Sox10-CreERT2 embryos, at low and high recombination levels, we calculated the respective probabilities of observing the specific clone configuration. Because the statistical model is based on count data, these probabilities are equivalent to likelihoods and thus twice the negative log of the likelihood ratio (deviance) was used to discriminate between the two frameworks (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). To simplify the interpretation, the numerical values of the deviance were discretized into no, weak, substantial, and strong evidence for a framework of multipotency (Figure 3). Based on this statistical evaluation, we first analyzed the cell cohorts (composed of two to eight cells from the same color) obtained with the Wnt1-CreERT embryos, pooling the data for low and high recombination densities. Strikingly, 65.1% (28 cases out of 43) of all uni-colored cell cohorts represented clones of the categories strong or substantial evidence for multipotency (Figures 3A and 3C). 27.9% (12 cases out of 43) of all cohorts analyzed were multipotent clones with more than two fates. In 18.6% (8 cases out of 43) of the clones, a progeny remained in the dNT. Half of these clones also contained cells in ventral structures as well as the DLP, demonstrating the broad developmental potential of the corresponding mother cells. Moreover, all uni-colored cell cohorts with derivatives in the DLP (18.6%, 8 cases out of 43) belonged to the category strong evidence for multipotency and contained NC-derived cells in at least one additional structure. Of all the cases analyzed, only 25.6% (11 cases out of 43) were belonging to the category no evidence for multipotency, indicating that lineage-restricted progenitor cells represent a minor fraction of premigratory NC cells (Figures 3A and 3C). Unexpectedly, clones with strong or substantial evidence for multipotency were by far the most frequent categories also in the Sox10-CreERT2 embryos (70.2%, 33 cases out of 47) (Figures 3B and 3C). 31.9% (15 cases out of 47) of all cohorts analyzed were multipotent clones with progeny in only two derivatives (bi-fated) and 38.3% (18 cases out of 47) were clones with progeny in more than two derivatives; 24.2% (8 cases out of 33) of the uni-colored cell cohorts with substantial or strong evidence for multipotency contributed to the DLP (Figure 3B). Of note, all of these were multipotent clones with cells in the DLP and in at least one other structure, and half of the DLP-clones contained cells in as many as three additional NC derivatives. Similar to premigratory NC cells, fate-restricted migratory NC cells showing no evidence for multipotency were 21.3% (10 out of 47) of all clones (Figures 3B and 3C). To assess the robustness of our statistical evaluation, we performed a sensitivity analysis by altering various parameters in the calculation of the multipotency likelihoods. When the minimum and maximum clone sizes were varied (rather than considering only clones of two to eight cells), the resulting clone categories were still predominantly strong and substantial evidence for multipotency (Figure 3D). Furthermore, we perturbed the values of color frequency (rcolor) and derivative size (dderiv) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures) by multiplying the probabilities and fractions by a random number between 1/3 and 3 (uniformly distributed), followed by rescaling. The analysis was carried out as described in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures, and the differences with respect to the evidence classification shown in Figures 3A and 3B were recorded. Figure 3E shows the results for 100 of such simulations and reveals that in both Wnt1-CreERT and Sox10-CreERT2 embryos, the categorization of the clones into no, weak, substantial, and strong evidence for multipotency was not (low recombination densities) or only moderately changed (high recombination densities). Thus, even when challenged by modulating various parameters, our statistical evaluation consistently revealed that the majority of premigratory and migratory NC cells were multipotent rather than fate restricted. The statistical analysis presented in Figure 3 was performed under the stringent criteria that the maximum clone size was eight cells. However, this clone size might not fully recapitulate the heterogeneity of embryonic cell populations, since it does not take into account the possibility that faster dividing cells might be present in distinct locations. Moreover, parameter modulation in our statistical analysis not only provided clear evidence for multipotency of NC cells but also predicted that cell cohorts larger than the chosen range of two to eight cells could also be actual clones. Therefore, we performed a further analysis, in which we considered all uni-colored cell cohorts found in defined trunk segments of Wnt1-CreERT and Sox10-CreERT2 mice. To increase the probability of clonal tracing, we restricted this analysis to cell cohorts expressing rare colors only. The clonal density was low, ranging from 0.1 ± 0.1 to 1.7 ± 0.3 clones per unit (Table S2B). By applying the statistical analysis mentioned above, we observed that the vast majority of the clones fell into the categories of strong or substantial evidence for multipotency, both in the Wnt1-CreERT line (76.4%, 42 cases out of 55) and in the Sox10-CreERT2 line (75%, 36 cases out of 48) (Figure S4). Thus, including larger clones into our analysis did not affect the proportion of multipotent clones originating from premigratory and migratory NC cells, respectively, further demonstrating the robustness of our statistical analysis. During NC development, fate segregations are accompanied by spatial segregations of the resulting cell lineages. Therefore, a clone simultaneously located to multiple structures represents the progeny of a multipotent mother cell (Figures 3 and 4S ). However, additional fate decisions are made within certain NC-derived structures, such as the DRG and SG, where neuronal lineages segregate from satellite glia. A multipotent clone with cells in DRG and SG could thus be a neuron-only clone consisting of different types of neurons (sensory, autonomic), a glia-only clone with distinct types of glia (Woodhoo and Sommer, 2008Woodhoo A. Sommer L. Development of the Schwann cell lineage: from the neural crest to the myelinated nerve.Glia. 2008; 56: 1481-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), or a mixed neuron-glia clone. To address this issue, we performed an additional clonal analysis, taking into consideration not only the location of uni-colored NC cells but also the expression of well-defined differentiation markers, such as Brn3a for sensory neurons, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) for autonomic neurons, and Sox10 for glial and melanocytic cells. Groups of cells belonging to the rare color category were considered, without clonal size restriction (Figure 4). Only 4 out of 20 clones (Wnt1-CreERT embryos) and 2 out of 16 clones (Sox10-CreERT2 embryos) were lineage restricted, respectively, meaning that these clones were not only confined to a single derivative, but they were also expressing only one marker of differentiation. Of note, of the 16 clones in Wnt1-CreERT embryos that were not lineage restricted, only one clone contained only neurons and no glia (clone ID 11; Figure 4A), while the other 14 clones were mixed neuron-glia clones. Likewise, one clone in Sox10-CreERT2 embryos contained sensory and sympathetic neurons but no glia (clone ID 11, Figure 4C), while all other multipotent clones were mixed neuronal and glial. Intriguingly, some of the cases that would have been considered to represent lineage-restricted clones based on their location, turned out to be at least bipotent, expressing multiple markers of differentiation (Figure 4A, clone IDs 13, 14, 15, and 16; Figure 4C, clone IDs 13 and 14). These data substantiate our findings that single premigratory, as well as single migratory NC cells, mostly generate daughter cells that localize to distinct target structures and acquire different fates. A fundamental question in developmental biology is how the distinct cell types of a given organ are established. Although it is thought that organ formation and homeostasis rely on the activity of organ-specific multipotent stem cells, several recent publications demonstrated that heterogeneous populations of restricted progenitor cells, instead of multipotent mother cells, are often involved in the formation of vertebrate body structures (Lehoczky et al., 2011Lehoczky J.A.

This issue is of particular interest with respect to the NC, because this structure represents one of the cell populations in the vertebrate embryo with the broadest developmental potential (Le Douarin et al., 2008Le Douarin N.M. Calloni G.W. Dupin E. The stem cells of the neural crest.Cell Cycle. 2008; 7: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several studies demonstrated that at least upon isolation, the majority of NC cells display stem cell features, being multipotent and able to self-renew (Dupin and Sommer, 2012Dupin E. Sommer L. Neural crest progenitors and stem cells: from early development to adulthood.Dev. Biol. 2012; 366: 83-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar).

However, how Rip3 phosphorylation is regulated is still largely unknown. Here we identified protein phosphatase 1B (Ppm1b) as a Rip3 phosphatase and found that Ppm1b restricts necroptosis in two settings: spontaneous necroptosis caused by Rip3 auto-phosphorylation in resting cells, and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF)-induced necroptosis in cultured cells. We revealed that Ppm1b selectively suppresses necroptosis through the dephosphorylation of Rip3, which then prevents the recruitment of mixed lineage kinase domain-like protein (Mlkl) to the necrosome. We further showed that Ppm1b deficiency (Ppm1b(d/d)) in mice enhanced TNF-induced death in a Rip3-dependent manner, and the role of Ppm1b in inhibiting necroptosis was evidenced by elevated Rip3 phosphorylation and tissue damage in the caecum of TNF-treated Ppm1b(d/d) mice. These data indicate that Ppm1b negatively regulates necroptosis through dephosphorylating Rip3 in vitro and in vivo."

However, mechanisms by which TFEB is regulated are poorly understood. This study demonstrates that gemfibrozil, an agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α, alone and in conjunction with all-trans-retinoic acid is capable of enhancing TFEB in brain cells. We also observed that PPARα, but not PPARβ and PPARγ, is involved in gemfibrozil-mediated up-regulation of TFEB. Reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies confirmed the recruitment of retinoid X receptor α, PPARα, and PGC1α on the PPAR-binding site on the Tfeb promoter as well. Subsequently, the drug-mediated induction of TFEB caused an increase in lysosomal protein and the lysosomal abundance in cell. Collectively, this study reinforces the link between lysosomal biogenesis and lipid metabolism with TFEB at the crossroads.

https://openalex.org/W2144237449,"Species distribution models (SDMs) are increasingly applied in conservation management to predict suitable habitat for poorly known populations. High predictive performance of SDMs is evident in validations performed within the model calibration area (interpolation), but few studies have assessed SDM transferability to novel areas (extrapolation), particularly across large spatial scales or pelagic ecosystems. We performed rigorous SDM validation tests on distribution data from three populations of a long-ranging marine predator, the grey petrel Procellaria cinerea, to assess model transferability across the Southern Hemisphere (25-65°S). Oceanographic data were combined with tracks of grey petrels from two remote sub-Antarctic islands (Antipodes and Kerguelen) using boosted regression trees to generate three SDMs: one for each island population, and a combined model. The predictive performance of these models was assessed using withheld tracking data from within the model calibration areas (interpolation), and from a third population, Marion Island (extrapolation). Predictive performance was assessed using k-fold cross validation and point biserial correlation. The two population-specific SDMs included the same predictor variables and suggested birds responded to the same broad-scale oceanographic influences. However, all model validation tests, including of the combined model, determined strong interpolation but weak extrapolation capabilities. These results indicate that habitat use reflects both its availability and bird preferences, such that the realized distribution patterns differ for each population. The spatial predictions by the three SDMs were compared with tracking data and fishing effort to demonstrate the conservation pitfalls of extrapolating SDMs outside calibration regions. This exercise revealed that SDM predictions would have led to an underestimate of overlap with fishing effort and potentially misinformed bycatch mitigation efforts. Although SDMs can elucidate potential distribution patterns relative to large-scale climatic and oceanographic conditions, knowledge of local habitat availability and preferences is necessary to understand and successfully predict region-specific realized distribution patterns."

However, this observed change is not indicative of the dysbiotic intestinal microbiota function that could result in the production of injurious and toxic products. Thus, knowledge of the effects of alcohol on the intestinal microbiota function and their metabolites is warranted, in order to better understand the role of the intestinal microbiota in alcohol associated organ failure. Here, we report the results of a differential metabolomic analysis comparing volatile organic compounds (VOC) detected in the stool of alcoholics and non-alcoholic healthy controls. We performed the analysis with fecal samples collected after passage as well as with samples collected directly from the sigmoid lumen. Regardless of the approach to fecal collection, we found a stool VOC metabolomic signature in alcoholics that is different from healthy controls. The most notable metabolite alterations in the alcoholic samples include: (1) an elevation in the oxidative stress biomarker tetradecane; (2) a decrease in five fatty alcohols with anti-oxidant property; (3) a decrease in the short chain fatty acids propionate and isobutyrate, important in maintaining intestinal epithelial cell health and barrier integrity; (4) a decrease in alcohol consumption natural suppressant caryophyllene; (5) a decrease in natural product and hepatic steatosis attenuator camphene; and (6) decreased dimethyl disulfide and dimethyl trisulfide, microbial products of decomposition. Our results showed that intestinal microbiota function is altered in alcoholics which might promote alcohol associated pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W1984905474,"We present a probabilistic registration algorithm that robustly solves the problem of rigid-body alignment between two shapes with high accuracy, by aptly modeling measurement noise in each shape, whether isotropic or anisotropic. For point-cloud shapes, the probabilistic framework additionally enables modeling locally-linear surface regions in the vicinity of each point to further improve registration accuracy. The proposed Iterative Most-Likely Point (IMLP) algorithm is formed as a variant of the popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm, which iterates between point-correspondence and point-registration steps. IMLP's probabilistic framework is used to incorporate a generalized noise model into both the correspondence and the registration phases of the algorithm, hence its name as a most-likely point method rather than a closest-point method. To efficiently compute the most-likely correspondences, we devise a novel search strategy based on a principal direction (PD)-tree search. We also propose a new approach to solve the generalized total-least-squares (GTLS) sub-problem of the registration phase, wherein the point correspondences are registered under a generalized noise model. Our GTLS approach has improved accuracy, efficiency, and stability compared to prior methods presented for this problem and offers a straightforward implementation using standard least squares. We evaluate the performance of IMLP relative to a large number of prior algorithms including ICP, a robust variant on ICP, Generalized ICP (GICP), and Coherent Point Drift (CPD), as well as drawing close comparison with the prior anisotropic registration methods of GTLS-ICP and A-ICP. The performance of IMLP is shown to be superior with respect to these algorithms over a wide range of noise conditions, outliers, and misalignments using both mesh and point-cloud representations of various shapes."
https://openalex.org/W1986757666,"Epidemiological networks are commonly used to explore dynamics of parasite transmission among individuals in a population of a given host species. However, many parasites infect multiple host species, and thus multi-host networks may offer a better framework for investigating parasite dynamics. We investigated the factors that influence parasite sharing--and thus potential transmission pathways--among rodent hosts in Southeast Asia. We focused on differences between networks of a single host species and networks that involve multiple host species. In host-parasite networks, modularity (the extent to which the network is divided into subgroups of rodents that interact with similar parasites) was higher in the multi-species than in the single-species networks. This suggests that phylogeny affects patterns of parasite sharing, which was confirmed in analyses showing that it predicted affiliation of individuals to modules. We then constructed ""potential transmission networks"" based on the host-parasite networks, in which edges depict the similarity between a pair of individuals in the parasites they share. The centrality of individuals in these networks differed between multi- and single-species networks, with species identity and individual characteristics influencing their position in the networks. Simulations further revealed that parasite dynamics differed between multi- and single-species networks. We conclude that multi-host networks based on parasite sharing can provide new insights into the potential for transmission among hosts in an ecological community. In addition, the factors that determine the nature of parasite sharing (i.e. structure of the host-parasite network) may impact transmission patterns."

Here, we address the effects of IF on redox state markers in different tissues in order to uncover how changes in feeding frequency alter redox balance in rats. IF rats displayed lower body mass due to decreased energy conversion efficiency. Livers in IF rats presented increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity and enhanced levels of protein carbonyls. Surprisingly, IF animals also presented an increase in oxidative damage in the brain that was not related to changes in mitochondrial bioenergetics. Conversely, IF promoted a substantial protection against oxidative damage in the heart. No difference in mitochondrial bioenergetics or redox homeostasis was observed in skeletal muscles of IF animals. Overall, IF affects redox balance in a tissue-specific manner, leading to redox imbalance in the liver and brain and protection against oxidative damage in the heart."

However, limited information is available regarding validity and reliability of these automated measurements (AM) and their correlation with parameters of the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS) compared to traditional manual measurements (MM). Methods As part of a cross-sectional feasibility study, AM of WC, HC and height were assessed twice in 60 participants using a 3D BS (VitussmartXXL). Additionally, MM were taken by trained personnel according to WHO guidelines. Participants underwent an interview, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and blood pressure measurement. Blood samples were taken to determine HbA1c, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid. Validity was assessed based on the agreement between AM and MM, using Bland-Altman-plots, correlation analysis, and paired t-tests. Reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) based on two repeated AM. Further, we calculated age-adjusted Pearson correlation for AM and MM with fat mass, systolic blood pressure, HbA1c, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and uric acid. Results Body measures were higher in AM compared to MM but both measurements were strongly correlated (WC, men, difference = 1.5cm, r = 0.97; women, d = 4.7cm, r = 0.96; HC, men, d = 2.3cm, r = 0.97; women, d = 3.0cm; r = 0.98). Reliability was high for all AM (nearly all ICC>0.98). Correlations of WC, HC, and the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with parameters of MetS were similar between AM and MM; for example the correlation of WC assessed by AM with HDL-cholesterol was r = 0.35 in men, and r = -0.48 in women, respectively whereas correlation of WC measured manually with HDL cholesterol was r = -0.41 in men, and r = -0.49 in women, respectively. Conclusions Although AM of WC, HC, and WHR are higher when compared to MM based on WHO guidelines, our data indicate good validity, excellent reliability, and similar correlations to parameters of the MetS."

We sought to test three hypotheses related to the determinants of workplace bullying: power distance at work; safety climate; and frustration related to perceived social inequality. A questionnaire survey was administered to a nationally representative community-based sample of 5,000 residents in Japan aged 20–60 years. The questionnaire included questions about employment, occupation, company size, education, household income, and subjective social status (SSS). We inquired about both the witnessing and personal experience of workplace bullying during the past 30 days. Among 2,384 respondents, data were analyzed from 1,546 workers. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine the social determinants of workplace bullying. Six percent and 15 percent of the total sample reported experiencing or witnessing workplace bullying, respectively. After adjusting for gender and age, temporary employees (Odds Ratio [OR]: 2.45 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.03–5.85]), junior high school graduates (OR: 2.62 [95%CI: 1.01–6.79]), workers with lowest household income (OR: 4.13 [95%CI:1.58–10.8]), and workers in the lowest SSS stratum (OR: 4.21 [95%CI:1.66–10.7]) were at increased risk of experiencing workplace bullying. When all variables were entered simultaneously in the model, a significant inverse association was observed between higher SSS and experiencing bullying (p = 0.002). Similarly in terms of witnessing bullying; SSS was significantly inversely associated (p = 0.017) while temporary employees reported a significantly higher risk of witnessing bullying compared to permanent workers (OR: 2.25 [95%CI:1.04 to 4.87]). The significant association between SSS and experiencing/witnessing workplace bullying supports the frustration hypothesis. The power distance hypothesis was also partly supported by the finding that temporary employees experienced a higher prevalence of workplace bullying."

Our laboratory has previously reported the development of genetically engineered DIPG mouse models using the RCAS/tv-a system, including a model driven by PDGF-B, H3.3K27M, and p53 loss. These models can serve as a platform in which to test novel therapeutics prior to the initiation of human clinical trials. In this study, an in vitro high-throughput drug screen as part of the DIPG preclinical consortium using cell-lines derived from our DIPG models identified BMS-754807 as a drug of interest in DIPG. BMS-754807 is a potent and reversible small molecule multi-kinase inhibitor with many targets including IGF-1R, IR, MET, TRKA, TRKB, AURKA, AURKB. In vitro evaluation showed significant cytotoxic effects with an IC50 of 0.13 μM, significant inhibition of proliferation at a concentration of 1.5 μM, as well as inhibition of AKT activation. Interestingly, IGF-1R signaling was absent in serum-free cultures from the PDGF-B; H3.3K27M; p53 deficient model suggesting that the antitumor activity of BMS-754807 in this model is independent of IGF-1R. In vivo, systemic administration of BMS-754807 to DIPG-bearing mice did not prolong survival. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that tumor tissue drug concentrations of BMS-754807 were well below the identified IC50, suggesting that inadequate drug delivery may limit in vivo efficacy. In summary, an unbiased in vitro drug screen identified BMS-754807 as a potential therapeutic agent in DIPG, but BMS-754807 treatment in vivo by systemic delivery did not significantly prolong survival of DIPG-bearing mice."

HFHS mice and OB/OB mice developed glycometabolic abnormalities in association with decreased mass of the gastrocnemius muscle, fast-to-slow transition of muscle fibers, and lipid accumulation (that occurred preferentially in slow compared to fast fibers). Moreover, we found in muscle fibers of HFHS and OB/OB mice accumulation of AGEs that was preferential for the lipid-accumulating cells, increased expression of the lipogenic pathway SCAP/SREBP, and co-localisation between AGEs and SCAP-(hyper)expressing cells (suggestive for SCAP glycosylation). The increased expression of the SCAP/SREBP lipogenic pathway in muscle fibers is a possible mechanism underlying lipid accumulation and linking myosteatosis to muscle fiber atrophy and fast-to-slow transition that occur in response to diabesity."

Although the transcriptional and epigenetic landscape of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has been extensively characterized (reviewed in Young, 2011Young R.A.

Although these studies have provided an understanding of the differences in chromatin interaction frequencies before and after ESC differentiation, the dynamic nuclear landscape that exists in single cells during the loss of ESC pluripotency and the onset of differentiation has not been examined. In this study, we characterized the spatial relationships between alleles of the Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog genes in single cells during the earliest stages of mouse ESC differentiation and embryonic development. Using multi-color DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 3D analysis of gene position in individual nuclei, we describe for the first time homologous pairing of the Oct4 alleles, and present evidence that such homologous pairing is correlated with the kinetics of ESC differentiation. Further, we observe Oct4 allelic pairing throughout the ectoderm/neuroectoderm of E7.75 mouse embryos, a developmental stage when dynamic regulation of Oct4 and lineage specification occurs in vivo. Importantly, we identify critical DNA elements within the Oct4 promoter/enhancer region that are sufficient to mediate inter-chromosomal interactions of a transgene with endogenous Oct4 alleles. Finally, we show that mutation of OCT4/SOX2 binding sites within this critical pairing region abolishes inter-chromosomal interactions and disrupts the accumulation of repressive epigenetic modifications at the Oct4 enhancer. Our findings demonstrate that chromatin organization and transcriptional programs are connected in ESCs, and that the dynamic positioning of the Oct4 alleles that occurs during ESC differentiation is linked to an exit from the pluripotent state. Because transcriptional regulation of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog genes is critical to the transition between pluripotency and lineage specification, we were interested in examining their nuclear organization during early ESC differentiation. The Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog genes are co-regulated, being bound by similar transcription factors (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G.

To assess the dynamic spatial relationship between Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog gene loci during ESC differentiation, v6.5 mouse ESCs were grown on coverslips in medium without leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and allowed to differentiate for four days. These ESCs were then fixed at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 days (−)LIF and multicolor DNA FISH was performed using DNA probes to Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog gene loci (Figures 1A–1E). Distances between DNA FISH signals in individual nuclei were measured in 3D, and in accordance with previous studies of inter-chromosomal associations (Augui et al., 2007Augui S. Filion G.J. Huart S.

Analysis of the frequency of allelic associations revealed that co-regulated Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog loci do not cluster together in undifferentiated ESCs. However, when differentiating ESCs were examined, we found that the homologous alleles of the Oct4 gene associate with each other with increased frequency at Day 3 (−)LIF (Figures 1D and 1F). The observed association of homologous Oct4 alleles during ESC differentiation was particularly intriguing, because pairing of homologous chromosomes is not a general feature of mammalian somatic cells (Duncan, 2002Duncan I.W. Transvection effects in Drosophila.Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 521-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Therefore, the occurrence of homologous Oct4 allelic associations was investigated in further detail. To investigate whether somatic homolog associations were a pervasive phenomenon during ESC differentiation, we measured the frequency of homologous allelic associations at additional gene loci by DNA FISH in undifferentiated ESCs (Day 0), and ESCs cultured for 3 days without LIF. Association of the Oct4 alleles was again observed at Day 3 (−)LIF, but not at Day 0 (Figure 2A). Interestingly, only the Oct4 locus showed a significant level of allelic associations at Day 3 (−)LIF; whereas other pluripotency gene loci (Sox2, Nanog), housekeeping gene loci (β-actin, Col1A1), distal regions of mouse chromosome 17 (C17E3), and the many other genomic regions examined (Table S1 and data not shown) failed to show a significant level of allelic associations during ESC differentiation (Figure 2A). Thus, the allelic pairing observed at Day 3 (−)LIF is not a general feature of all gene loci in differentiating ESCs, but rather an event specific to the Oct4 gene locus. Although numerous studies have shown a relationship between nuclear organization and transcription, the specific mechanism(s) by which a gene’s position may affect gene expression remain unclear. Therefore, we sought to investigate whether Oct4 allelic pairing might be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the Oct4 gene as differentiation proceeds. To assess the transcriptional status of paired Oct4 alleles in individual nuclei, Oct4 RNA FISH was performed in combination with Oct4 DNA FISH on ESCs at Day 3 (−)LIF. This analysis revealed that 37% of paired Oct4 alleles show transcription from both alleles (Figure 2B, upper), 24% show transcription from only one allele (Figure 2B, middle), whereas 39% show no visible transcripts at either allele (Figure 2B, bottom). These results suggest that allelic associations may commence prior to or concurrent with the repression of the Oct4 gene as differentiation progresses. Alternatively, Oct4 allelic pairing may be coincident with increased transcriptional pulsing at the locus and modulation of Oct4 expression levels. Importantly, RNA FISH signals were not detected at either Oct4 allele after 5 days (−)LIF (data not shown), confirming that both copies of the gene are repressed during ESC differentiation. Therefore, Oct4 allelic pairing occurs during the transition of Oct4 expression from an “on” to “off” state. Next, we tested whether varied differentiation paradigms might affect the timing and/or frequency of Oct4 allelic associations. To this end, we used an ESC line containing a stably integrated DOX-inducible shRNA to Oct4 (Oct4.468/R26-rtTA ESCs) (Premsrirut et al., 2011Premsrirut P.K. Dow L.E. Kim S.Y. Camiolo M. Malone C.D. Miething C. Scuoppo C. Zuber J. Dickins R.A. Kogan S.C. et al.A rapid and scalable system for studying gene function in mice using conditional RNA interference.Cell. 2011; 145: 145-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and induced differentiation using three distinct paradigms: (−) LIF, addition of retinoic acid (RA), and DOX-induced Oct4 shRNA expression (Figure 2C). Interestingly, RT-qPCR analysis of Oct4 gene expression revealed that the kinetics of Oct4 gene repression varied depending on the differentiation protocol used (Figure 2D). LIF withdrawal induced a gradual decrease in Oct4 expression over the course of the 3 days; Oct4 mRNA levels were reduced to less than 50% of Day 0 expression levels by Day 3 (−)LIF (Figure 2D). In contrast, treatment with RA or Oct4 shRNA resulted in a more rapid loss of Oct4 gene expression; transcript levels were reduced to 40% and 20% of Day 0 expression levels, respectively, after just 1 day of differentiation (Figure 2D). When Oct4 allelic pairing was assessed, the onset of pairing was again observed at Day 3 (−)LIF, coincident with the downregulation of Oct4 gene expression (Figures 2E and 2F). In contrast, ESCs differentiated with RA or Oct4 shRNA induction showed an earlier onset of Oct4 allelic associations, after only 1 day of differentiation (Figures 2E and 2F). Remarkably, the earlier onset of Oct4 allelic pairing observed with RA or shRNA treatment is accompanied by a more rapid loss of Oct4 gene expression in these differentiation paradigms. Thus, the timing of Oct4 allelic pairing corresponds to the kinetics of Oct4 gene repression in each differentiation paradigm. These results suggest that the pairing of Oct4 alleles is associated with Oct4 gene repression, or is linked to a particular developmental stage in which Oct4 downregulation occurs. Although differentiating ESCs can partially recapitulate embryonic development in vitro, we were interested in whether the observed Oct4 allelic associations would also occur in vivo during early mouse embryo development. In the post-implantation mouse epiblast, Oct4 expression in the ectoderm/neuroectoderm is downregulated in an anterior to posterior manner concurrent with neural lineage specification and loss of pluripotency (Downs, 2008Downs K.M.

Chambers I. Wilson V. The developmental dismantling of pluripotency is reversed by ectopic Oct4 expression.Development. 2012; 139: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if Oct4 allelic pairing was correlated with repression of the Oct4 gene, high levels of Oct4 allelic pairing should be observed in nuclei of the anterior neuroectoderm where the gene was being coordinately repressed. Thus, we assessed the frequency of Oct4 allelic association in sagittal sections of late head fold stage (Downs and Davies, 1993Downs K.M. Davies T. Staging of gastrulating mouse embryos by morphological landmarks in the dissecting microscope.Development. 1993; 118: 1255-1266PubMed Google Scholar) mouse embryos, which were harvested at E7.75. Embryos were immunolabeled with an OCT4 antibody to identify regions of the embryo actively expressing the OCT4 protein (Figures 3A–3C), and immunostaining was assessed in three embryonic regions as indicated: anterior (Ant.), middle (Mid.), and posterior (Pos.) (Figures 3A and S3). Next, multicolor DNA FISH was performed, using DNA probes to Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog gene loci. Distances between homologous alleles were measured in ectoderm/neuroectoderm cells, and the percentage of nuclei with paired homologous loci was calculated for each embryonic region (Figures 3D–3G). Interestingly, pairing of homologous Oct4 alleles was observed at roughly equal levels (∼25%–30%) in ectoderm/neuroectoderm cells of all three regions, regardless of the level of OCT4 immunofluorescence observed in each region (Figures 3D–3G). When distances between Nanog and Sox2 alleles were assessed in the same nuclei, allelic associations were not observed (Figure 3G). In addition, examination of distances between Oct4 alleles in embryos at earlier (approximately embryonic day 6.5 [E6.5], epiblast cells) and later (∼E9.5, neural epithelium) stages of development did not show a significant level of allelic associations compared to control loci (Figures S3D–S3F). These results are consistent with our in situ data and indicate that the pairing of Oct4 alleles is linked to a developmental time point when expression of the Oct4 gene is being regulated. Having observed that allelic pairing of the Oct4 gene is associated with the transition from pluripotency to differentiation, we sought to elucidate the mechanism facilitating pairing of the Oct4 alleles. We reasoned that specific protein and/or RNA factors bind to the Oct4 locus and mediate the pairing event, and that the Oct4 locus must therefore contain specific DNA elements where such factors will bind. To assess the role of the genomic DNA sequence in Oct4 allelic pairing, ESC lines with single-copy, site-specific integrations of various fragments of a 10kb region of genomic DNA surrounding and including the Oct4 gene were generated. A schematic diagram of the strategy used for targeted insertion of Oct4 fragments at the Col1A1 locus in KH2 ESCs (Beard et al., 2006Beard C. Hochedlinger K. Plath K. Wutz A. Jaenisch R. Efficient method to generate single-copy transgenic mice by site-specific integration in embryonic stem cells.Genesis. 2006; 44: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar) is shown in Figure 4A. The 10kb Oct4 genomic region of interest was divided into four fragments (Figure 4B), and four new ESC lines (OCF2, OCF3, OCF4, and OCF5) were generated via Flp-mediated recombination. Transgene-specific DNA FISH probes were used to verify proper transgene integration at the Col1A1 locus in resulting ESC clones (Figure 4C). Next, each new ESC line was differentiated with RA for 1 day, and the frequency of transgene associations with the endogenous Oct4 alleles was assessed. To compare the contribution of the transgenic fragment to the pairing event, the following 3D distance measurements were made in each ESC nucleus: the distance between endogenous Oct4 alleles (Oct4(En): Oct4(En), Figures S4B and 4D, arrow 1), the distance from the WT-Col1A1 locus to each endogenous Oct4 allele (WT-Col1A: Oct4(En), Figures S4A and 4D, arrow 2), and the distance from the Tg-Col1A1 locus to the nearest endogenous Oct4 allele (Tg-Col1A: Oct4(En), Figures S4C and 4D, arrow 3). For each of the ESC lines tested, the endogenous alleles of the Oct4 gene paired with significant frequency at Day 1 of RA differentiation, as expected (Figures 4E and S4B). Furthermore, WT-Col1A1 and endogenous Oct4 alleles did not associate to a significant degree on Day 1 of RA differentiation in any of the tested ESC lines (Figures 4E and S4A). Strikingly, when the frequency of Tg-Col1A1 and endogenous Oct4 alleles was assessed in each cell line, the OCF2 transgenic allele showed an increased frequency of Oct4(En) associations compared to WT-Col1A1 (Figures 4E and S4C). In OCF2 ESC nuclei where these associations were observed, interactions between the OCF2 transgene and endogenous Oct4 loci involved one Oct4 allele in 83% of nuclei (Figure 4F), and both endogenous Oct4 alleles in 17% of nuclei (Figure 4G). These results suggest that DNA elements exist within the OCF2 DNA fragment that are sufficient to mediate pairing of a transgenic locus with endogenous Oct4 loci. The OCF2 DNA fragment contains 3.6 kb of genomic DNA sequence from the 5′ regulatory region of the Oct4 gene, which includes the distal enhancer (DE), proximal enhancer, and a fragment of the Oct4 promoter (ΔPr, Figure 5A). Although this 3.6 kb OCF2 fragment was sufficient to mediate pairing between the transgene and endogenous Oct4 genes, we found that any further truncation of the 3.6 kb fragment abolished pairing activity (Figures S4D and S4E). Therefore, we reasoned that there may be multiple separate DNA elements/motifs along this 3.6 kb stretch of DNA, and that proteins binding to multiple sites in the 3.6 kb sequence may work synergistically to mediate allelic associations.

https://openalex.org/W2093581165,"Carnivorous plants use different morphological features to attract, trap and digest prey, mainly insects. Plants from the genus Nepenthes possess specialized leaves called pitchers that function as pitfall-traps. These pitchers are filled with a digestive fluid that is generated by the plants themselves. In order to digest caught prey in their pitchers, Nepenthes plants produce various hydrolytic enzymes including aspartic proteases, nepenthesins (Nep). Knowledge about the generation and induction of these proteases is limited. Here, by employing a FRET (fluorescent resonance energy transfer)-based technique that uses a synthetic fluorescent substrate an easy and rapid detection of protease activities in the digestive fluids of various Nepenthes species was feasible. Biochemical studies and the heterologously expressed Nep II from Nepenthes mirabilis proved that the proteolytic activity relied on aspartic proteases, however an acid-mediated auto-activation mechanism was necessary. Employing the FRET-based approach, the induction and dynamics of nepenthesin in the digestive pitcher fluid of various Nepenthes plants could be studied directly with insect (Drosophila melanogaster) prey or plant material. Moreover, we observed that proteolytic activity was induced by the phytohormone jasmonic acid but not by salicylic acid suggesting that jasmonate-dependent signaling pathways are involved in plant carnivory."
https://openalex.org/W2087345828,"Formaldehyde (FA) is a common environmental contaminant that has toxic effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Our previous data demonstrated that hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the third endogenous gaseous mediator, has protective effects against FA-induced neurotoxicity. As is known to all, Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), a member of the neurotrophin gene family, mediates its neuroprotective properties via various intracellular signaling pathways triggered by activating the tyrosine kinase receptor B (TrkB). Intriguingly, our previous data have illustrated the upregulatory role of H2S on BDNF protein expression in the hippocampus of rats. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized that H2S provides neuroprotection against FA toxicity by regulating BDNF-TrkB pathway. In the present study, we found that NaHS, a donor of H2S, upregulated the level of BDNF protein in PC12 cells, and significantly rescued FA-induced downregulation of BDNF levels. Furthermore, we found that pretreatment of PC12 cells with K252a, an inhibitor of the BDNF receptor TrkB, markedly reversed the inhibition of NaHS on FA-induced cytotoxicity and ablated the protective effects of NaHS on FA-induced oxidative stress, including the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), 4-hydroxy-2-trans-nonenal (4-HNE), and malondialdehyde (MDA). We also showed that K252a abolished the inhibition of NaHS on FA-induced apoptosis, as well as the activation of caspase-3 in PC12 cells. In addition, K252a reversed the protection of H2S against FA-induced downregulation of Bcl-2 protein expression and upregulation of Bax protein expression in PC12 cells. These data indicate that the BDNF-TrkB pathway mediates the neuroprotection of H2S against FA-induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis in PC12 cells. These findings provide a novel mechanism underlying the protection of H2S against FA-induced neurotoxicity."

https://openalex.org/W2050156341,"The zinc (Zn) supply increases the fruit yield of Citrus trees that are grown, especially in the highly weathered soils of the tropics due to the inherently low nutrient availability in the soil solution. Leaf sprays containing micronutrients are commonly applied to orchards, even though the nutrient supply via soil could be of practical value. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of Zn fertilizers that are applied to the soil surface on absorption and partitioning of the nutrient by citrus trees. A greenhouse experiment was conducted with one-year-old sweet orange trees. The plants were grown in soils with different textures (18.1 or 64.4% clay) that received 1.8 g Zn per plant, in the form of either ZnO or ZnSO4 enriched with the stable isotope 68Zn. Zinc fertilization increased the availability of the nutrient in the soil and the content in the orange trees. Greater responses were obtained when ZnSO4 was applied to the sandy loam soil due to its lower specific metal adsorption compared to that of the clay soil. The trunk and branches accumulated the most fertilizer-derived Zn (Zndff) and thus represent the major reserve organ for this nutrient in the plant. The trees recovered up to 4% of the applied Zndff. Despite this relative low recovery, the Zn requirement of the trees was met with the selected treatment based on the total leaf nutrient content and increased Cu/Zn-SOD activity in the leaves. We conclude that the efficiency of Zn fertilizers depends on the fertilizer source and the soil texture, which must be taken into account by guidelines for fruit crop fertilization via soil, in substitution or complementation of traditional foliar sprays."
https://openalex.org/W2057011390,"Migratory salmon transit estuary habitats on their way out to the ocean but this phase of their life cycle is more poorly understood than other phases. The estuaries of large river systems in particular may support many populations and several species of salmon that originate from throughout the upstream river. The Skeena River of British Columbia, Canada, is a large river system with high salmon population- and species-level diversity. The estuary of the Skeena River is under pressure from industrial development, with two gas liquefaction terminals and a potash loading facility in various stages of environmental review processes, providing motivation for understanding the usage of the estuary by juvenile salmon. We conducted a juvenile salmonid sampling program throughout the Skeena River estuary in 2007 and 2013 to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of different species and populations of salmon. We captured six species of juvenile anadromous salmonids throughout the estuary in both years, and found that areas proposed for development support some of the highest abundances of some species of salmon. Specifically, the highest abundances of sockeye (both years), Chinook in 2007, and coho salmon in 2013 were captured in areas proposed for development. For example, juvenile sockeye salmon were 2–8 times more abundant in the proposed development areas. Genetic stock assignment demonstrated that the Chinook salmon and most of the sockeye salmon that were captured originated from throughout the Skeena watershed, while some sockeye salmon came from the Nass, Stikine, Southeast Alaska, and coastal systems on the northern and central coasts of British Columbia. These fish support extensive commercial, recreational, and First Nations fisheries throughout the Skeena River and beyond. Our results demonstrate that estuary habitats integrate species and population diversity of salmon, and that if proposed development negatively affects the salmon populations that use the estuary, then numerous fisheries would also be negatively affected."
https://openalex.org/W2028856097,"Impaired development of embryos produced by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) is mostly associated with faulty reprogramming of the somatic nucleus to a totipotent state and can be improved by treatment with epigenetic modifiers. Here we report that addition of 100 μM vitamin C (VitC) to embryo culture medium for at least 16 h post-activation significantly increases mouse blastocyst formation and, when combined with the use of latrunculin A (LatA) during micromanipulation and activation procedures, also development to term. In spite of this, no significant effects on pluripotency (OCT4 and NANOG) or nuclear reprogramming markers (H3K14 acetylation, H3K9 methylation and DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation) could be detected. The use of LatA alone significantly improved in vitro development, but not full-term development. On the other hand, the simultaneous treatment of cloned embryos with VitC and the histone deacetylase inhibitor psammaplin A (PsA), in combination with the use of LatA, resulted in cloning efficiencies equivalent to those of VitC or PsA treatments alone, and the effects on pluripotency and nuclear reprogramming markers were less evident than when only the PsA treatment was applied. These results suggest that although both epigenetic modifiers improve cloning efficiencies, possibly through different mechanisms, they do not show an additive effect when combined. Improvement of SCNT efficiency is essential for its applications in reproductive and therapeutic cloning, and identification of molecules which increase this efficiency should facilitate studies on the mechanism of nuclear reprogramming and acquisition of totipotency."
https://openalex.org/W2058469341,"Unlike CNS neurons in adult mammals, neurons in fish and embryonic mammals can regenerate their axons after injury. These divergent regenerative responses are in part mediated by the growth-associated expression of select transcription factors. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, MASH1/Ascl1a, is transiently expressed during the development of many neuronal subtypes and regulates the expression of genes that mediate cell fate determination and differentiation. In the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), Ascl1a is also transiently expressed in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that regenerate axons after optic nerve crush. Utilizing transgenic zebrafish with a 3.6 kb GAP43 promoter that drives expression of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), we observed that knock-down of Ascl1a expression reduces both regenerative gap43 gene expression and axonal growth after injury compared to controls. In mammals, the development of noradrenergic brainstem neurons requires MASH1 expression. In contrast to zebrafish RGCs, however, MASH1 is not expressed in the mammalian brainstem after spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, we utilized adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to overexpress MASH1 in four month old rat (Rattus norvegicus) brainstem neurons in an attempt to promote axon regeneration after SCI. We discovered that after complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord and implantation of a Schwann cell bridge, animals that express MASH1 exhibit increased noradrenergic axon regeneration and improvement in hindlimb joint movements compared to controls. Together these data demonstrate that MASH1/Ascl1a is a fundamental regulator of axonal growth across vertebrates and can induce modifications to the intrinsic state of neurons to promote functional regeneration in response to CNS injury."
https://openalex.org/W2124633618,"Nerve degeneration after transection injury decreases intraoperative visibility under white light (WL), complicating surgical repair. We show here that the use of fluorescently labeled nerve binding probe (F-NP41) can improve intraoperative visualization of chronically (up to 9 months) denervated nerves. In a mouse model for the repair of chronically denervated facial nerves, the intraoperative use of fluorescent labeling decreased time to nerve identification by 40% compared to surgeries performed under WL alone. Cumulative functional post-operative recovery was also significantly improved in the fluorescence guided group as determined by quantitatively tracking of the recovery of whisker movement at time intervals for 6 weeks post-repair. To our knowledge, this is the first description of an injectable probe that increases visibility of chronically denervated nerves during surgical repair in live animals. Future translation of this probe may improve functional outcome for patients with chronic denervation undergoing surgical repair."

https://openalex.org/W2015420155,"The effects of prenatal stress procedure were investigated in 3 months old male rats. Prenatally stressed rats showed depressive-like behavior in the forced swim test, including increased immobility, decreased mobility and decreased climbing. In ex vivo frontal cortex slices originating from prenatally stressed animals, the amplitude of extracellular field potentials (FPs) recorded in cortical layer II/III was larger, and the mean amplitude ratio of pharmacologically-isolated NMDA to the AMPA/kainate component of the field potential—smaller than in control preparations. Prenatal stress also resulted in a reduced magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP). These effects were accompanied by an increase in the mean frequency, but not the mean amplitude, of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) in layer II/III pyramidal neurons. These data demonstrate that stress during pregnancy may lead not only to behavioral disturbances, but also impairs the glutamatergic transmission and long-term synaptic plasticity in the frontal cortex of the adult offspring."

https://openalex.org/W2097758446,"Objective Although extensive resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) changes have been reported in schizophrenia, rsFC changes of the frontal pole (FP) remain unclear. The FP contains several subregions with different connection patterns; however, it is unknown whether the FP subregions are differentially affected in schizophrenia. To explore this possibility, we compared rsFC differences of the FP subregions between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Method One hundred healthy controls and 91 patients with schizophrenia underwent resting-state functional MRI with a sensitivity-encoded spiral-in (SENSE-SPIRAL) imaging sequence to reduced susceptibility-induced signal loss and distortion. The FP was subdivided into the orbital (FPo), medial (FPm), and lateral (FPl) subregions. Mean fMRI time series were extracted for each FP subregion and entered into a seed-based rsFC analysis. Results The FP subregions exhibited differential rsFC patterns in both healthy controls and schizophrenia patients. Direct comparison between groups revealed reduced rsFCs between the bilateral FPl and several cognitive-related regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, temporal cortex and inferior parietal lobule in schizophrenia. Although the FPl exhibited obvious atrophy, rsFC changes were unrelated to volumetric atrophy in the FPl, to duration of illness, and to antipsychotic medication dosage. No significant differences were observed in the rsFCs of other FP subregions. Conclusion These findings suggest a selective (the lateral subregion) functional disconnection of the FP subregions in schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2022338176,"Due to the high diversity of bacteria in many ecosystems, their slow generation times, specific but mostly unknown nutrient requirements and syntrophic interactions, isolation based approaches in microbial ecology mostly fail to describe microbial community structure. Thus, cultivation independent techniques, which rely on directly extracted nucleic acids from the environment, are a well-used alternative. For example, bacterial automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (B-ARISA) is one of the widely used methods for fingerprinting bacterial communities after PCR-based amplification of selected regions of the operon coding for rRNA genes using community DNA. However, B-ARISA alone does not provide any taxonomic information and the results may be severely biased in relation to the primer set selection. Furthermore, amplified DNA stemming from mitochondrial or chloroplast templates might strongly bias the obtained fingerprints. In this study, we determined the applicability of three different B-ARISA primer sets to the study of bacterial communities. The results from in silico analysis harnessing publicly available sequence databases showed that all three primer sets tested are specific to bacteria but only two primers sets assure high bacterial taxa coverage (1406f/23Sr and ITSF/ITSReub). Considering the study of bacteria in a plant interface, the primer set ITSF/ITSReub was found to amplify (in silico) sequences of some important crop species such as Sorghum bicolor and Zea mays. Bacterial genera and plant species potentially amplified by different primer sets are given. These data were confirmed when DNA extracted from soil and plant samples were analyzed. The presented information could be useful when interpreting existing B-ARISA results and planning B-ARISA experiments, especially when plant DNA can be expected."
https://openalex.org/W2023285706,"Range shifts (especially during the Pleistocene), polyploidisation and hybridization are major factors affecting high-mountain biodiversity. A good system to study their role in the European high mountains is the Doronicum clusii aggregate (Asteraceae), whose four taxa (D. clusii s.s., D. stiriacum, D. glaciale subsp. glaciale and D. glaciale subsp. calcareum) are differentiated geographically, ecologically (basiphilous versus silicicolous) and/or via their ploidy levels (diploid versus tetraploid). Here, we use DNA sequences (three plastid and one nuclear spacer) and AFLP fingerprinting data generated for 58 populations to infer phylogenetic relationships, origin of polyploids—whose ploidy level was confirmed by chromosomally calibrated DNA ploidy level estimates—and phylogeographic history. Taxonomic conclusions were informed, among others, by a Gaussian clustering method for species delimitation using dominant multilocus data. Based on molecular data we identified three lineages: (i) silicicolous diploid D. clusii s.s. in the Alps, (ii) silicicolous tetraploid D. stiriacum in the eastern Alps (outside the range of D. clusii s.s.) and the Carpathians and (iii) the basiphilous diploids D. glaciale subsp. glaciale (eastern Alps) and D. glaciale subsp. calcareum (northeastern Alps); each taxon was identified as distinct by the Gaussian clustering, but the separation of D. glaciale subsp. calcareum and D. glaciale subsp. glaciale was not stable, supporting their taxonomic treatment as subspecies. Carpathian and Alpine populations of D. stiriacum were genetically differentiated suggesting phases of vicariance, probably during the Pleistocene. The origin (autopolyploid versus allopolyploid) of D. stiriacum remained unclear. Doronicum glaciale subsp. calcareum was genetically and morphologically weakly separated from D. glaciale subsp. glaciale but exhibited significantly higher genetic diversity and rarity. This suggests that the more widespread D. glaciale subsp. glaciale originated from D. glaciale subsp. calcareum, which is restricted to a prominent Pleistocene refugium previously identified in other alpine plant species."
https://openalex.org/W2011781987,"As a form of attention, mindfulness is qualitatively receptive and non-reactive, and is thought to facilitate adaptive emotional responding. One suggested mechanism is that mindfulness facilitates disengagement from an affective stimulus and thereby decreases affective reactivity. However, mindfulness has been conceptualized as a state, intervention, and trait. Because evidence is mixed as to whether self-reported trait mindfulness decreases affective reactivity, we used a multi-method approach to study the relationship between individual differences in self-reported trait mindfulness and electrocortical, electrodermal, electromyographic, and self-reported responses to emotional pictures. Specifically, while participants (N = 51) passively viewed pleasant, neutral, and unpleasant IAPS pictures, we recorded high-density (128 channels) electrocortical, electrodermal, and electromyographic data to the pictures as well as to acoustic startle probes presented during the pictures. Afterwards, participants rated their subjective valence and arousal while viewing the pictures again. If trait mindfulness spontaneously reduces general emotional reactivity, then for individuals reporting high rather than low mindfulness, response differences between emotional and neutral pictures would show relatively decreased early posterior negativity (EPN) and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes, decreased skin conductance responses, and decreased subjective ratings for valence and arousal. High mindfulness would also be associated with decreased emotional modulation of startle eyeblink and P3 amplitudes. Although results showed clear effects of emotion on the dependent measures, in general, mindfulness did not moderate these effects. For most measures, effect sizes were small with rather narrow confidence intervals. These data do not support the hypothesis that individual differences in self-reported trait mindfulness are related to spontaneous emotional responses during picture viewing."

This study aimed to investigate the association between previously diagnosed AMD and dementia using a population-based dataset in Taiwan. Methods Data for this case-control study were retrospectively collected from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. We identified 13,402 subjects who had a diagnosis of dementia as cases, and 40,206 subjects without dementia as controls. A conditional logistic regression was used to examine the association of dementia with previously diagnosed neovascular AMD. Results We found that of the study sample of 53,608 subjects, 1.01% had previously diagnosed neovascular AMD, 1.35% and 0.90% for cases and the controls, respectively (p<0.001). The conditional logistic regression analysis suggested that the odds ratio of prior neovascular AMD for cases was 1.37 (95% confidence interval: 1.14~1.65) compared to the controls after adjusting for subjects’ age, monthly income, geographic location, urbanization level, and hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, stroke, ischemic heart disease, and whether or not a subjects underwent cataract surgery prior to index date than controls.

https://openalex.org/W2008259106,"Steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR) and its murine ortholog, pregnane X receptor (PXR), are nuclear receptors that are expressed at high levels in the liver and the intestine where they function as xenobiotic sensors that induce expression of genes involved in detoxification and drug excretion. Recent evidence showed that SXR and PXR are also expressed in bone tissue where they mediate bone metabolism. Here we report that systemic deletion of PXR results in aging-dependent wearing of articular cartilage of knee joints. Histomorphometrical analysis showed remarkable reduction of width and an enlarged gap between femoral and tibial articular cartilage in PXR knockout mice. We hypothesized that genes induced by SXR in chondrocytes have a protective effect on articular cartilage and identified Fam20a (family with sequence similarity 20a) as an SXR-dependent gene induced by the known SXR ligands, rifampicin and vitamin K2. Lastly, we demonstrated the biological significance of Fam20a expression in chondrocytes by evaluating osteoarthritis-related gene expression of primary articular chondrocytes. Consistent with epidemiological findings, our results indicate that SXR/PXR protects against aging-dependent wearing of articular cartilage and that ligands for SXR/PXR have potential role in preventing osteoarthritis caused by aging."
https://openalex.org/W2080344868,"Previous evidence showed that, due to refocusing of static dephasing effects around large vessels, spin-echo (SE) BOLD signals offer an increased linearity and promptness with respect to gradient-echo (GE) acquisition, even at low field. These characteristics suggest that, despite the reduced sensitivity, SE fMRI might also provide a potential benefit when investigating spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity. However, there are no reports on the application of spin-echo fMRI for connectivity studies at low field. In this study we compared resting state functional connectivity as measured with GE and SE EPI sequences at 3T. Main results showed that, within subject, the GE sensitivity is overall larger with respect to that of SE, but to a less extent than previously reported for activation studies. Noteworthy, the reduced sensitivity of SE was counterbalanced by a reduced inter-subject variability, resulting in comparable group statistical connectivity maps for the two sequences. Furthermore, the SE method performed better in the ventral portion of the default mode network, a region affected by signal dropout in standard GE acquisition. Future studies should clarify if these features of the SE BOLD signal can be beneficial to distinguish subtle variations of functional connectivity across different populations and/or treatments when vascular confounds or regions affected by signal dropout can be a critical issue."
https://openalex.org/W2143671503,"Background: A common modelling approach in public health and epidemiology divides the population under study into compartments containing persons that share the same status. Here we consider a three-state model with the compartments: A, B and Dead. States A and B may be the states of any dichotomous variable, for example, Healthy and Ill, respectively. The transitions between the states are described by change rates (or synonymously: densities), which depend on calendar time and on age. So far, a rigorous mathematical calculation of the prevalence of property B has been difficult, which has limited the use of the model in epidemiology and public health. Methods: We develop an equation that simplifies the use of the three-state model. To demonstrate the broad applicability and the validity of the equation, it is applied to simulated data and real world data from different health-related topics. Results: The three-state model is governed by a partial differential equation (PDE) that links the prevalence with the change rates between the states. The validity of the PDE has been shown in two simulation studies, one about a hypothetical chronic disease and one about dementia. In two further applications, the equation may provide insights into smoking behaviour of males in Germany and the knowledge about the ovulatory cycle in Egyptian women. Conclusions: We have found a simple equation that links the prevalence of a dichotomous variable with the transmission rates in the three-state model. The equation has a broad applicability in epidemiology and public health. Examples are the estimation of incidence rates from cross-sectional surveys, the prediction of the future prevalence of chronic diseases, and planning of interventions against risky behaviour (e.g., smoking)."

We therefore took up the present study to explore if the leishmanial lipid (pLLD) isolated from L. donovani can play an anti-neoplastic role in acute myeloid leukemia cells by regulating cellular growth. Indeed pLLD significantly inhibited cell proliferation of four AML cell lines (HL-60, MOLT-4, U937, and K562). Scanning electron microscopy and DNA fragmentation analysis revealed that it significantly induced apoptosis of U937 cells through morphological alteration. Occurrence of apoptosis was checked by using Annexin exposure and this established that the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1 phase in time-dependent manner. pLLD increased the intracellular ROS with alteration of mitochondrial membrane potential, as detected using DCFDA. It also regulated the expression of apoptosis-related proteins like Bax, Bcl2, Bad and t-Bid besides causing cleavage of PARP as determined by western blot analysis. Treatment of U937 cells with pLLD induced the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2, p38, and caspases 9/3. The results suggest that pLLD induces apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia cells possibly via increasing intracellular ROS and regulating the MAPK pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2041463677,"For prawn trawling systems, drag reduction is a high priority as the trawling process is energy intensive. Large benefits have occurred through the use of multiple-net rigs and thin twine in the netting. An additional positive effect of these successful twine-area reduction strategies is the reduced amount of otter board area required to spread the trawl systems, which leads to further drag reduction. The present work investigated the potential of redirecting the drag-strain within a prawn trawl away from the wings and the otter boards to the centre line of the trawl, where top and bottom tongues have been installed, with an aim to minimise the loading/size of the otter boards required to spread the trawl. In the system containing the new ‘W’ trawl, the drag redirected to the centre-line tongues is transferred forward through a connected sled and towing wires to the trawler. To establish the extent of drag redirection to the centre-line tongues and the relative drag benefits of the new trawl system, conventional and ‘W’ trawls of 3.65 m headline length were tested firstly over a range of spread ratios in the flume tank, and subsequently at optimum spread ratio in the field. The developed ‘W’ trawl effectively directed 64% of netting-drag off the wings and onto the centre tongues, which resulted in drag savings in the field of ∼20% for the associated ‘W’ trawl/otter-board/sled system compared to the traditional trawl/otter-board arrangement in a single trawl or twin rig configuration. Furthermore, based on previously published data, the new trawl when used in a twin rig system is expected to provide approximately 12% drag reduction compared to quad rig. The twin ‘W’ trawl system also has benefits over quad rig in that a reduced number of cod-end/By-catch Reduction Device units need to be installed and attended each tow."

In this study, we wanted to explore the reasons behind such differences in gene essentiality by cross-species comparison of human and mouse. Moreover, we examined essential genes that are duplicated in humans are functionally more redundant than that in mouse. The proportion of paralog pseudogenization of essential genes is higher in mouse than that of humans. These duplicates of essential genes are under stringent dosage regulation in human than in mouse. We also observed slower evolutionary rate in the paralogs of human essential genes than the mouse counterpart.

https://openalex.org/W2080814686,"An implicit mapping of number to space via a “mental number line” occurs automatically in adulthood. Here, we systematically explore the influence of differing representations of quantity (no quantity, non-symbolic magnitudes, and symbolic numbers) and directional flow of stimuli (random flow, left-to-right, or right-to-left) on learning and attention via a match-to-sample working memory task. When recalling a cognitively demanding string of spatial locations, subjects performed best when information was presented right-to-left. When non-symbolic or symbolic numerical arrays were embedded in these spatial locations, and mental number line congruency prompted, this effect was attenuated and in some cases reversed. In particular, low-performing female participants who viewed increasing non-symbolic number arrays paired with the spatial locations exhibited better recall for left-to-right directional flow information relative to right-to-left, and better processing for the left side of space relative to the right side of space. The presence of symbolic number during spatial learning enhanced recall to a greater degree than non-symbolic number—especially for female participants, and especially when cognitive load is high—and this difference was independent of directional flow of information. We conclude that quantity representations have the potential to scaffold spatial memory, but this potential is subtle, and mediated by the nature of the quantity and the gender and performance level of the learner."

The only strain (among all antibiotic-resistant E. coli isolates) that possessed class 1 integron was PGB01. The dihydrofolate reductase gene of the said integron was cloned, sequenced and expressed in E. coli JM109. Since PGB01 was native to pigeon’s gut, we have compared the growth of PGB01 at two different temperatures, 42°C (normal body temperature of pigeon) and 37°C (optimal growth temperature of E. coli; also the human body temperature), with E. coli K12. It was found that PGB01 grew better than the laboratory strain E. coli K12 at 37°C as well as at 42°C. In the thermal fitness assay, it was observed that the cells of PGB01 were better adapted to 42°C, resembling the average body temperature of pigeon. The strain PGB01 also sustained more microwave mediated thermal stress than E. coli K12 cells. The NMR spectra of the whole cells of PGB01 varied from E. coli K12 in several spectral peaks relating some metabolic adaptation to thermotolerance. On elevating the growth temperature from 37°C to 42°C, susceptibility to kanamycin (both strains were sensitive to it) of E. coli K12 was increased, but in case of PGB01 no change in susceptibility took place. We have also attempted to reveal the basis of trimethoprim resistance phenotype conferred by the dfrA7 gene homologue of PGB01. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation study of docked complexes, PGB01-DfrA7 and E. coli TMP-sensitive-Dfr with trimethoprim (TMP) showed loss of some of the hydrogen and hydrophobic interaction between TMP and mutated residues in PGB01-DfrA7-TMP complex compared to TMP-sensitive-Dfr-TMP complex. This loss of interaction entails decrease in affinity of TMP for PGB01-DfrA7 compared to TMP-sensitive-Dfr."
