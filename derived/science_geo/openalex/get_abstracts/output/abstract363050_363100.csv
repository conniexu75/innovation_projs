https://openalex.org/W2118758371,"Michael Clarke and colleagues find that cancer stem cell in breast tumours have lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the rest of the tumour cells. This property renders cancer stem cells less sensitive to radiation therapy, which may cause radio resistance in breast cancer. This study shows that cancer stem cell in breast tumours have lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than the rest of the tumour cells. This property renders cancer stem cells less sensitive to radiation therapy, which may cause radioresistance in breast cancer. The metabolism of oxygen, although central to life, produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that have been implicated in processes as diverse as cancer, cardiovascular disease and ageing. It has recently been shown that central nervous system stem cells1,2 and haematopoietic stem cells and early progenitors3,4,5,6 contain lower levels of ROS than their more mature progeny, and that these differences are critical for maintaining stem cell function. We proposed that epithelial tissue stem cells and their cancer stem cell (CSC) counterparts may also share this property. Here we show that normal mammary epithelial stem cells contain lower concentrations of ROS than their more mature progeny cells. Notably, subsets of CSCs in some human and murine breast tumours contain lower ROS levels than corresponding non-tumorigenic cells (NTCs). Consistent with ROS being critical mediators of ionizing-radiation-induced cell killing7,8, CSCs in these tumours develop less DNA damage and are preferentially spared after irradiation compared to NTCs. Lower ROS levels in CSCs are associated with increased expression of free radical scavenging systems. Pharmacological depletion of ROS scavengers in CSCs markedly decreases their clonogenicity and results in radiosensitization. These results indicate that, similar to normal tissue stem cells, subsets of CSCs in some tumours contain lower ROS levels and enhanced ROS defences compared to their non-tumorigenic progeny, which may contribute to tumour radioresistance."

https://openalex.org/W2092603991,"Recent studies indicate that the methylation state of histones can be dynamically regulated by histone methyltransferases and demethylases. The H3K9-specific demethylase Jhdm2a (also known as Jmjd1a and Kdm3a) has an important role in nuclear hormone receptor-mediated gene activation and male germ cell development. Through disruption of the Jhdm2a gene in mice, here we demonstrate that Jhdm2a is critically important in regulating the expression of metabolic genes. The loss of Jhdm2a function results in obesity and hyperlipidemia in mice. We provide evidence that the loss of Jhdm2a function disrupts beta-adrenergic-stimulated glycerol release and oxygen consumption in brown fat, and decreases fat oxidation and glycerol release in skeletal muscles. We show that Jhdm2a expression is induced by beta-adrenergic stimulation, and that Jhdm2a directly regulates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Ppara) and Ucp1 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that beta-adrenergic activation-induced binding of Jhdm2a to the PPAR responsive element (PPRE) of the Ucp1 gene not only decreases levels of H3K9me2 (dimethylation of lysine 9 of histone H3) at the PPRE, but also facilitates the recruitment of Ppargamma and Rxralpha and their co-activators Pgc1alpha (also known as Ppargc1a), CBP/p300 (Crebbp) and Src1 (Ncoa1) to the PPRE. Our studies thus demonstrate an essential role for Jhdm2a in regulating metabolic gene expression and normal weight control in mice."
https://openalex.org/W2113561798,"The dramatic increase in heterogeneous types of biological data—in particular, the abundance of new protein sequences—requires fast and user-friendly methods for organizing this information in a way that enables functional inference. The most widely used strategy to link sequence or structure to function, homology-based function prediction, relies on the fundamental assumption that sequence or structural similarity implies functional similarity. New tools that extend this approach are still urgently needed to associate sequence data with biological information in ways that accommodate the real complexity of the problem, while being accessible to experimental as well as computational biologists. To address this, we have examined the application of sequence similarity networks for visualizing functional trends across protein superfamilies from the context of sequence similarity. Using three large groups of homologous proteins of varying types of structural and functional diversity—GPCRs and kinases from humans, and the crotonase superfamily of enzymes—we show that overlaying networks with orthogonal information is a powerful approach for observing functional themes and revealing outliers. In comparison to other primary methods, networks provide both a good representation of group-wise sequence similarity relationships and a strong visual and quantitative correlation with phylogenetic trees, while enabling analysis and visualization of much larger sets of sequences than trees or multiple sequence alignments can easily accommodate. We also define important limitations and caveats in the application of these networks. As a broadly accessible and effective tool for the exploration of protein superfamilies, sequence similarity networks show great potential for generating testable hypotheses about protein structure-function relationships."
https://openalex.org/W1982522146,"In immune cells, generation of sustained Ca(2+) levels is mediated by the Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) (CRAC) current. Molecular key players in this process comprise the stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) that functions as a Ca(2+) sensor in the endoplasmic reticulum and ORAI1 located in the plasma membrane. Depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) stores leads to STIM1 multimerization into discrete puncta, which co-cluster with ORAI1 to couple to and activate ORAI1 channels. The cytosolic C terminus of STIM1 is sufficient to activate ORAI1 currents independent of store depletion. Here we identified an ORAI1-activating small fragment (OASF, amino acids 233-450/474) within STIM1 C terminus comprising the two coiled-coil domains and additional 50-74 amino acids that exhibited enhanced interaction with ORAI1, resulting in 3-fold increased Ca(2+) currents. This OASF, similar to the complete STIM1 C terminus, displayed the ability to homomerize by a novel assembly domain that occurred subsequent to the coiled-coil domains. A smaller fragment (amino acids 233-420) generated by a further deletion of 30 amino acids substantially reduced the ability to homomerize concomitant to a loss of coupling to as well as activation of ORAI1. Extending OASF by 35 amino acids (233-485) did not alter homomerization but substantially decreased efficiency in coupling to and activation of ORAI1. Expressing OASF in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL) mast cells demonstrated its enhanced plasma membrane targeting associated with 2.5-fold larger CRAC currents in comparison with the complete STIM1 C terminus. In aggregate, we have identified two cytosolic key regions within STIM1 C terminus that control ORAI1/CRAC activation: a homomerization domain indispensable for coupling to ORAI1 and a modulatory domain that controls the extent of coupling to ORAI1."
https://openalex.org/W2136773221,"Airway mucus forms the structural basis of the local innate immune defense mechanism. It is an integrated, active, viscoelastic gel matrix evolved to protect the exposed lung from physical, chemical, and pathological erosion. Exosomes are biologically active vesicles secreted by different cell types including epithelial, hematopoietic, and some tumor cells. They are also present in some biological fluids such as serum, urine, breast milk, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that exosome-like vesicles with antiviral properties are present in human tracheobronchial epithelial (HTBE) cell culture secretions. These vesicles have been isolated by differential centrifugation and are characterized further by mass spectrometry, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, electron microscopy, and light-scattering methods. HTBE vesicles exhibited characteristic exosomal size (30-100 nm) and morphology (cup-shaped) with a buoyant density in sucrose of 1.12-1.18 g/ml. Biochemical characterization further revealed typical surface, cytoskeletal, and cytoplasmic proteins characteristic of exosomes, including the multivesicular and late endosomal membrane markers Tsg101 and CD63. The presence of RNA was also observed. The epithelial mucins MUC1, MUC4, and MUC16 also contributed to the vesicles' structure. Notably, alpha-2,6-linked sialic acid was associated with these mucin molecules and subsequent functional analysis showed that these vesicles have a neutralizing effect on human influenza virus, which is known to bind sialic acid. Taken together, these findings suggest that airway epithelial cells release exosome-like vesicles and that these structures may be involved in diverse physiological processes in airway biology, including innate mucosal defense."
https://openalex.org/W1980265098,"The host galaxy of the quasar SDSS J114816.64+525150.3 (at redshift z = 6.42, when the Universe was less than a billion years old) has an infrared luminosity of 2.2 x 10(13) times that of the Sun, presumably significantly powered by a massive burst of star formation. In local examples of extremely luminous galaxies, such as Arp 220, the burst of star formation is concentrated in a relatively small central region of <100 pc radius. It is not known on which scales stars are forming in active galaxies in the early Universe, at a time when they are probably undergoing their initial burst of star formation. We do know that at some early time, structures comparable to the spheroidal bulge of the Milky Way must have formed. Here we report a spatially resolved image of [C ii] emission of the host galaxy of J114816.64+525150.3 that demonstrates that its star-forming gas is distributed over a radius of about 750 pc around the centre. The surface density of the star formation rate averaged over this region is approximately 1,000 year(-1) kpc(-2). This surface density is comparable to the peak in Arp 220, although about two orders of magnitude larger in area. This vigorous star-forming event is likely to give rise to a massive spheroidal component in this system."
https://openalex.org/W2030835578,"Exoribonucleases are important processing enzymes in many aspects of RNA metabolism. The activity of yeast Rat1, a 5′–3′ exonuclease, is stimulated by Rai1. In this work, Liang Tong and colleagues report the structures of two complexes: Rat1–Rai1 and DOM3Z (the mouse Rat1 homologue)–Rai1. These structures reveal the mechanism of exonuclease activity and define the catalytic differences with another class of nucleases containing a PIN domain. In addition, the work reveals that Rai1 has pyrophosphohydrolase activity, the first such activity found in eukaryotes. This study reports the structures of two complexes: Rat1–Rai1 and Dom3Z (the mouse Rat1 homologue)–Rai1. These structures reveal the mechanism of exonuclease activity and define the catalytic differences with another class of nucleases containing a PIN domain. The work also reveals that Rai1 has pyrophosphohydrolase activity, the first such activity found in eukaryotes. The 5′→3′ exoribonucleases (XRNs) comprise a large family of conserved enzymes in eukaryotes with crucial functions in RNA metabolism and RNA interference1,2,3,4,5. XRN2, or Rat1 in yeast6, functions primarily in the nucleus and also has an important role in transcription termination by RNA polymerase II (refs 7–14). Rat1 exoribonuclease activity is stimulated by the protein Rai1 (refs 15, 16). Here we report the crystal structure at 2.2 Å resolution of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Rat1 in complex with Rai1, as well as the structures of Rai1 and its murine homologue Dom3Z alone at 2.0 Å resolution. The structures reveal the molecular mechanism for the activation of Rat1 by Rai1 and for the exclusive exoribonuclease activity of Rat1. Biochemical studies confirm these observations, and show that Rai1 allows Rat1 to degrade RNAs with stable secondary structure more effectively. There are large differences in the active site landscape of Rat1 compared to related and PIN (PilT N terminus) domain-containing nucleases17,18,19,20. Unexpectedly, we identified a large pocket in Rai1 and Dom3Z that contains highly conserved residues, including three acidic side chains that coordinate a divalent cation. Mutagenesis and biochemical studies demonstrate that Rai1 possesses pyrophosphohydrolase activity towards 5′ triphosphorylated RNA. Such an activity is important for messenger RNA degradation in bacteria21, but this is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of this activity in eukaryotes and suggests that Rai1/Dom3Z may have additional important functions in RNA metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2055036333,"The fibrinogen-related protein family (FREP, also known as FBN) is an evolutionarily conserved immune gene family found in mammals and invertebrates. It is the largest pattern recognition receptor gene family in Anopheles gambiae, with as many as 59 putative members, while the Drosophila melanogaster genome has only 14 known FREP members. Our sequence and phylogenetic analysis suggest that this remarkable gene expansion in the mosquito is the result of tandem duplication of the fibrinogen domain. We found that the majority of the FREP genes displayed immune-responsive transcription after challenge with bacteria, fungi, or Plasmodium, and these expression patterns correlated strongly with gene phylogeny and chromosomal location. Using RNAi-mediated gene-silencing assays, we further demonstrated that some FREP members are essential factors of the mosquito innate immune system that are required for maintaining immune homeostasis, and members of this family have complementary and synergistic functions. One of the most potent anti-Plasmodium FREP proteins, FBN9, was found to interact with both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and strongly co-localized with both rodent and human malaria parasites in the mosquito midgut epithelium, suggesting that its defensive activity involves direct interaction with the pathogen. Interestingly, FBN9 formed dimers that bound to the bacterial surfaces with different affinities. Our findings indicate that the A. gambiae FREP gene family plays a central role in the mosquito innate immune system and provides an expanded pattern recognition and anti-microbial defense repertoire.

Our findings indicate that the A. gambiae FREP gene family plays a central role in the mosquito innate immune system and provides an expanded pattern recognition and anti-microbial defense repertoire. Mosquitoes transmit a broad range of human parasitic and viral diseases, of which malaria remains the most devastating disease with a worldwide prevalence of over 400 million cases and 2 million deaths per year. The mosquito innate immunity plays a pivotal role in the interaction between a pathogen and the insect vector, and it determines the mosquito vectorial capacity. This immune defense system is comprised of cellular and humoral mechanisms that are activated upon recognition of invading pathogens by the mosquito pattern recognition receptor (PRR) molecules. Recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) can indirectly trigger a variety of defense mechanisms through the activation of serine protease cascades and intracellular immune signaling pathways that control the transcription of effectors, or it can directly invoke killing mechanisms such as encapsulation and phagocytosis (1Dimopoulos G.

Whereas microbial exposure of mosquitoes can be quite extensive, the molecular mechanisms responsible for recognizing such a diverse range of microbes is not yet well understood. Insect immune surveillance systems lack antibody-mediated pathogen recognition and must instead rely on a rather limited set of pattern recognition receptors that detect invariant and evolutionarily conserved molecules on the surface of pathogens (4Janeway Jr., C.A. Medzhitov R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 197-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (6235) Google Scholar). Such a system would conceptually only be capable of distinguishing between broad categories of pathogens, such as Gram-positive versus Gram-negative bacteria (5Lemaitre B. Reichhart J.M.

Full-length or partial predicted sequences of FREP homologues were aligned using the ClustalX program, and cladograms were constructed by neighbor-joining analysis and displayed through Treeview software. The chromosomal location of each FREP gene was manually searched through Vector-Base, and the relationship between the phylogenetic tree and chromosomal location were drawn manually using Adobe Photoshop 8.0. Secondary structure predictions were obtained using the PHD program, with multiple sequence alignment of FBG domains.

Immune Challenges for Transcriptional Analysis-To prepare bacterial-challenged samples for transcriptional analyses, 4-day-old mosquitoes were first injected with ∼20,000 heat-inactivated Escherichia coli or Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Approximately 10 mosquitoes were collected 4 h after challenge for each replicate, and at least three replicates were included. For the preparation of fungus-challenged samples, 4-day-old female mosquitoes were rolled over in a Petri dish with fully grown Beauveria bassiana (B. bassiana) with spores. Mosquitoes were then released into a paper cup and incubated for 24 h in the regular insectary. Plasmodium infections were carried out according to standard procedures and our established protocols (30Dong Y. Aguilar R. Xi Z. Warr E. Mongin E. Dimopoulos G. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 42Vlachou D. Schlegelmilch T. Christophides G.K. Kafatos F.C. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1185-1195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Plasmodium berghei (P. berghei) infections were performed with a transgenic GFP P. berghei strain of wild-type ANKA at 21 °C, with mosquitoes fed on an uninfected mouse as a control. Plasmodium falciparum (P. falciparum) NF54 gametocyte cultures were prepared as previously described, and mosquitoes were fed on cultures through a membrane feeder at 37 °C and then maintained at 26 °C; mosquitoes fed on uninfected human blood were used as a control (30Dong Y. Aguilar R. Xi Z. Warr E. Mongin E. Dimopoulos G. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 43Carter R. Ranford-Cartwright L. Alano P. Methods Mol. Biol. 1993; 21: 67-88PubMed Google Scholar). Mosquito midguts were dissected at 24 h after feeding, and unfed mosquitoes were removed; the remaining mosquitoes were kept at 21 °C for 13 days or 26 °C for 8 days for P. berghei and P. falciparum infections, respectively. The infection phenotypes were determined as previously described (30Dong Y. Aguilar R. Xi Z. Warr E. Mongin E. Dimopoulos G. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar, 44Vlachou D. Zimmermann T. Cantera R. Janse C.J. Waters A.P. Kafatos F.C. Cell Microbiol. 2004; 6: 671-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Primers Design, Semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and qRT-PCR-The primers used for the RT-PCR transcriptional analysis were designed with the Primer 3 Program on a web-based server. Given that the FBG domain has high homology across all the FREP genes, the designed primer sequences were further BLAST-searched against the whole genome of A. gambiae. The primer sequences with no other hits with over 80% identity were selected. The primer specificity was tested with only one fragment having been amplified; the PCR products obtained were ∼300 bp (supplemental Table S2). Using the 39 FREP genes from the A. gambiae genome that have been well-annotated in Ensembl 26 (Nov. 2004), we designed a panel of 39 pairs of primers. The FBN15 primers amplified two fragments and were therefore excluded from further analysis. The primer sequences used are listed in supplemental Table S2. Reverse transcription was carried out at 42 °C for 2 h using a SuperScript II kit (Invitrogen) and 20-μl reaction mixtures containing oligo (dT) primers and 2 μg of total RNA. The PCR cycles were controlled to produce a non-saturated band, indicating the linear amplification. Optimal cycle numbers were empirically determined from a test PCR run, and three replicates were obtained for each gene. The PCR products were separated by gel electrophoresis and the DNA bands documented using a Fuji camera after SYBR Green staining (Qiagen). Signal intensities from the gels were quantified using Science Lab 98 software (Fuji-film Imaging System). The fold induction or repression of immune-challenged samples was determined by comparing the results obtained to those for the control PBS treatment, normalizing the data to the PCR intensity obtained for the housekeeping ribosomal gene S7. The fold changes in expression were log2-transformed and hierarchically clustered into a color schematic profile using Cluster software, then organized according to transcription specificity by using TreeView software from Eisen Lab. The efficiency of the gene silencing was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), carried out essentially according to Ref. 30Dong Y. Aguilar R. Xi Z. Warr E. Mongin E. Dimopoulos G. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar. Quantification was carried out using the QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) and ABI Detection System ABI Prism 7300. RNAi Gene Silencing and Immune Challenge Assays-To make these assays as cost effective as possible, we employed a protocol based on using the same set of primers that were used in the semi-quantitative PCR for expression analysis to synthesize the required dsRNAs. The plasmid vector LITMUS 28i (New England Biolabs) was engineered as a TA cloning vector by digestion with NsiI and KpnI for 2 h, followed by Klenow treatment for 30 min. The vector was cleaned with the Mini-Elute Enzyme cleaning kit (Qiagen), then incubated with dTTP and Taq polymerase at 70 °C for 1 h. The product was cleaned again with the Qiagen kit before being used as a TA cloning vector, with the cloning site attached and T7 primers at both ends. The 38 FREP PCR fragments were amplified using the primers, then individually cloned into this TA cloning vector. FREP fragments with T7 sequences attached were obtained through a second round of PCR with the T7 primers. The sense and antisense RNAs were then synthesized from these fragments using the T7 MEGAscript kit (Ambion). About 69 nl of dsRNA (3 μg/μl) was introduced into the thorax of cold-anesthetized 4-day-old female mosquitoes using a nano-injector (Nanoject, Drummond) according to established methodology (45Blandin S. Moita L.F. Kocher T. Wilm M. Kafatos F.C. Levashina E.A. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 852-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). For both the control (dsGFP-injected) and experimental (gene dsRNA-injected) groups, ∼80 4-day-old female mosquitoes were injected. Gene silencing was verified 3–4 days after injection by qRT-PCR using at least three biological replicates, with the A. gambiae ribosomal S7 gene as the internal control for the normalization. The primers used for silencing verification are presented in supplemental Table S2. 3–4 days after dsRNA injection, survival analysis of RNAi gene-silenced mosquitoes was carried out according to established protocol (30Dong Y. Aguilar R. Xi Z. Warr E. Mongin E. Dimopoulos G. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Dead mosquitoes were counted and removed daily over a 7-day period after challenge with bacteria. Student’s t test and two-way analysis of variance were used to assess the significance of the gene silencing effect on mosquito survival after challenge, with p values <0.05 being considered significant. P. berghei and P. falciparum infections of RNAi gene-silenced mosquitoes were done essentially according to our previous work (30Dong Y. Aguilar R. Xi Z. Warr E. Mongin E. Dimopoulos G. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e52Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Enumeration of Endogenous Bacteria from RNAi Gene-silenced Mosquitoes-Isolation of bacteria from gene-silenced mosquitoes and colony forming unit (CFU) enumeration and determination were done essentially according to Ref. 10Dong Y. Taylor H.E. Dimopoulos G. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e229Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar. The hemolymph was obtained by perfusion of surface-sterilized mosquitoes 4 days after dsRNA injection, and CFU were determined by plating serial dilutions of the hemolymph on LB agar plates and incubating the plates at 27 °C for 2 days. Each assay was performed using pooled hemolymph from two mosquitoes, and at least 10 independent replicates were obtained for each gene. The species of the isolated bacteria were determined by amplifying a region of the 16S rDNA as described, using primers 27f and 1492r (46Lane D.J. Stackebrandt E. Goodfellow M. Nucleic Acid Techniques in Bacterial Systematics. John Wiley and Sons, New York1991: 115-175Google Scholar). PCR products were sequenced and BLAST-searched against the Nucleotide Collection (nr/nt) data base to verify the species identifications. Anti-FBN9 Antibody-A PCR fragment of FBN9, spanning a region that coded for a peptide from amino acids 47–118 was cloned into the EK-LIC vector according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Novagen). The kanamycin-resistant bacterial colonies were further screened for positive clones by PCR analysis with specific FBN9 primers, and the in-frame sequences with the histidine tag were also confirmed by DNA sequencing. The positive clones were then transformed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS-competent cells (Novagen) and induced with 0.4 m isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The recombinant FBN9 protein was purified on an Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), and the eluted fractions were run on 4–12% SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen, Novex, Tris-glycine gel) to confirm that only a single band had been purified. A polyclonal antibody recognizing FBN9 was prepared by injection of the purified protein into rabbits. The titer and specificity of the antibody were assessed by Western blot analysis using the purified recombinant protein. Immunohistochemical Staining and Confocal Microscopy-Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis of the interaction of the Sua5B cells with FITC conjugates of E. coli and S. aureus (Molecular Probes) was essentially based on the description given in (10Dong Y. Taylor H.E. Dimopoulos G. PLoS Biol. 2006; 4: e229Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). FBN9 antibody and preimmune serum as a control were used at 1:400 dilution. Immunostain"

It is an undifferentiated small round cell tumor of the bone and soft tissue with an unknown cell of origin. Currently, the cure rate for patients with localized disease is only 70%, and is less than 30% for patients showing metastatic disease despite intensive multimodal treatment strategies (1Grier H.E.

Med. 2003; 348: 694-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). There is a need for more effective therapies to treat ESFT, especially in patients with metastases. ESFT is characterized by chromosomal translocations occurring between the genes for the TET (TAF15, EWS, and TLS) family member protein EWS and members of the ETS family of DNA-binding transcription factors. In ∼90% of the cases, the translocation occurs between chromosome 22 and chromosome 11 (2Sandberg A.A. Bridge J.A.

The pathway is composed of three Hh ligands (Sonic, Indian, and Desert Hh) that all bind to the Patched1 receptor. In the absence of Hh ligand, Patched inhibits another transmembrane protein, Smoothened. When Patched is engaged by the Hh ligand, Smoothened is activated because of diminished inhibitory signal from Patched. The signal is then transduced to the important downstream effectors GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3, which act as transcription factors. GLI1 is the most potent isoform at inducing cellular transformation (19Kimura H. Stephen D. Joyner A. Curran T. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 4026-4036Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Many of the mutations in human cancers result in overexpression of Hh ligand, inactivation of Patched1, or increased activation of Smoothened.

The GLI1 inhibitor NSC75503 was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute. All of the compounds were dissolved in DMSO. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay-The chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and as published before (6Abaan O.D. Levenson A. Khan O. Furth P.A. Uren A. Toretsky J.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell lysates were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. Samples immunoprecipitated with anti-FLI1 antibody, no antibody control, or the input were amplified with PCR (see supplemental Table S1 for primer sequences). Luciferase Assays-GLI1 activity was assessed using a pGL3-Basic luciferase construct containing 8× GLI1-binding sites attached to a chicken lens crystalline promoter (pGL38xGLI) (American Type Culture Collection-Johns Hopkins Special Collections, deposited by P. A. Beachy, Manassas, VA) and a Renilla-TK mutant construct (Kindly provided by Dr. Stephen Byers, Georgetown University). COS7 cells were cotransfected with an EWS-FLI1 expression vector or empty vector control (CIneo) in addition to the pGL38xGLI luciferase and Renilla TK mutant constructs with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according the manufacturer’s protocol. In studies using drug treatment, the cells were treated with drug 24 h after transfection, and then luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection. GLI1 promoter activity was measured using the GLI1/pGL3 construct, which contains the full-length GLI1 promoter (kindly provided by Dr. Philip Iannaccone, Northwestern University). An NF-κB responsive construct that has 5× NF-κB-binding sites (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as a negative control. COS7 cells were transfected with either empty vector control or EWS-FLI1 construct in addition to the luciferase constructs with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according the manufacturer’s protocol. Luciferase activity was measured 24 h after transfection. The mutant GLI1 promoter was created by mutating all the possible FLI1 DNA-binding sites GGAA and TTCC to GCTA and TAGC. These mutations have been previously shown to abrogate EWS-FLI1 binding ability (32Uren A. Tcherkasskaya O. Toretsky J.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 13579-13589Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). All of the luciferase assays were performed using a dual luciferase assay kit according the manufacturer’s protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Immunoblotting-Whole cell lysates from cells grown to near confluency were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The membranes were then subject to blocking in 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20) for 1 h. Dilutions for primary were anti-GLI1(L42B10) at 1:1000 (Cell Signaling, Boston, MA), anti-FLI1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:2000, and anti-actin-horseradish peroxidase (C-11, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 1:3000 or β-tubulin (MP Biomedicals, Solon, OH) at 1:5000. Primary antibodies were added to the membrane in 5% nonfat dry milk in 1× TTBS for 2 h. The membrane was then washed three times in 1× TTBS, and horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) in 5% nonfat dry milk was added for 1 h. The blots were than washed three times in 1× TTBS and then developed using Millipore Immobilon Western chemiluminescent horseradish peroxidase substrate per the manufacturer’s instructions (Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA). Chemiluminescence was detected using a Fujifilm LAS-3000 imaging system. Densitometry values were obtained using Multigauge software (FUJIFILM Corp). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR-Total RNA was extracted from cell lines by TRIzol (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed as previously described (33Sacedon R. Varas A. Hernandez-Lopez C. Gutierrez-deFrias C. Crompton T. Zapata A.G. Vicente A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2003; 51: 1557-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). siRNA Experiments-Control scrambled siRNA was purchased from Invitrogen. The sequence is as follows 5′-AAAGTCATCGTGACTACGACG-3′. ON-TARGETplus SMART-pool GLI1 siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon (Dharmacon, Inc., Chicago, IL) that contains four distinct siRNA species targeting different sequences of the GLI1 transcript. TC-32 and TC-71 cells were electroporated in Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) using a Cell-Porator (Invitrogen). For TC-32 cells, 4 million cells were electroporated with 500 nm siRNA at 350 V and plated in triplicate at 1,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Viable cells were quantified using 10 μl of WST-1 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol after 5 days. The rest of the cells were plated in a 6-well dish and were lysed after 5 days for subsequent immunoblotting. For TC-71 cells, 4 million cells were electroporated with 250 nm siRNA at 300 V and plated in triplicate at 5,000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Viable cells were quantified using 10 μl of WST-1 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol after 3 days. The rest of the cells were plated in a 6-well dish and were lysed after 3 days for subsequent immunoblotting. OD values were converted to cell numbers by doing a WST cell titration experiment for both TC-32 and TC-71 and then performing a linear regression using Prism Graphpad 4.0 for Macintosh. Cellular Proliferation and Soft Agar Assays-Cellular proliferation was assessed by triplicate plating at a density of 1000 cells/well in a 96-well plate. Cyclopamine or 75503 at varying concentrations or vehicle alone (1% DMSO) were added in media containing 5% FBS to cells 4 h after plating once the cells had attached. Fresh medium containing drug or vehicle was added every 2 days. Viable cells were quantified using 10μl of WST-1 reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer’s protocol after 72 h. For soft agar assays, 6% SeaPlaqueGTG agarose (Lonza, Rockland, ME) was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline as a stock solution and kept in 65 °C water bath. Bottom agar at 0.6% concentration was added as 1 ml to each well of a 12-well cell culture plate and left to solidify at room temperature. Five thousand of TC32 cells were resuspended in 1 ml of top agar (0.4%) and plated as triplicate. The plate was kept at room temperature for 10–15 min until the top agar solidified and placed in a 37 °C cell culture incubator for 2–3 weeks. Colonies were stained with MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) for 2 h at 37 °C. Images of colonies were taken by Fuji LAS-3000 imaging system, and colony size and counting analysis was carried out by using Multigauge Colony Count Software. The experiments were repeated at least twice. GLI1 Is a Direct Transcriptional Target of EWS-FLI1-Modulation of EWS-FLI1 expression was associated with increased GLI1 mRNA levels in cDNA array experiments (29Smith R. Owen L.A. Trem D.J. Wong J.S. Whangbo J.S. Golub T.R. Lessnick S.L. Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). An observed increase in GLI1 mRNA can be either a direct or indirect effect of EWS-FLI1 expression. Therefore, we evaluated the possibility of GLI1 promoter being a direct target of EWS-FLI1. The GLI1 promoter has previously been mapped and characterized (34Liu C.Z. Yang J.T. Yoon J.W. Villavicencio E. Pfendler K. Walter-house D. Iannaccone P. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 209: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 35Villavicencio E.H. Yoon J.W. Frank D.J. Fuchtbauer E.M. Walter-house D.O. Iannaccone P.M. Genesis. 2002; 32: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Analysis of the GLI1 promoter sequence identified 12 potential EWS-FLI1-binding sites, which are characterized by GGAA (Fig. 1A) (36Mao X. Miesfeldt S. Yang H. Leiden J.M. Thompson C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18216-18222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To show a direct interaction between EWS-FLI1 and the GLI1 promoter in ESFT cells, we performed ChIP experiments (Fig. 1B). We used the FLI1 antibody for immunoprecipitation of EWS-FLI1 because FLI1 is not expressed in ESFT cells (6Abaan O.D. Levenson A. Khan O. Furth P.A. Uren A. Toretsky J.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We designed six primer pairs to cover the entire length of GLI1 promoter (Fig. 1A). ChIP assay revealed interaction between EWS-FLI1 protein and multiple segments of the GLI1 promoter. Primers pairs 1, 3, and 5 gave positive ChIP results, whereas primers 4 and 6 were negative (Fig. 1B). Primer pair 2 gave same intensity bands in both the FLI1 IP and the control IP. Therefore, it was considered a negative result because of nonspecific product formation. PTPL1, a known direct transcriptional target of EWS-FLI1 (6Abaan O.D. Levenson A. Khan O. Furth P.A. Uren A. Toretsky J.A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2715-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Control immunoprecipitations were performed in the absence of primary antibody, and negative controls for the PCR were performed in the absence of DNA. These results suggest that EWS-FLI1 is binding directly to elements of the GLI1 promoter in ESFT cells. The following experiments were designed to study the functional outcome of EWS-FLI1 protein and the GLI1 promoter interaction. GLI1 Gene Promoter Is Activated by EWS-FLI1-We examined whether EWS-FLI1 activates transcription from the GLI1 promoter. COS7 cells were cotransfected with EWS-FLI1 in a CIneo expression vector and the full-length GLI1 gene promoter in a pGL3 basic luciferase vector (GLI1/pGL3). We showed that when EWS-FLI1 protein is expressed, it significantly increased activity of the GLI1 promoter. The experiment has been repeated a total of seven times with the average fold increase of 2.5 (data not shown). The activity of the GLI1 promoter is also increased in a dose-dependent manner compared to the empty vector control (Fig. 1C) with the highest expression of EWS-FLI1 giving a 3.5-fold increase in promoter activity. Transfection of EWS-FLI1 did not increase an NF-KB-responsive promoter (data no shown), which was used as a negative control to rule out the possibility that EWS-FLI1 can nonspecifically activate any reporter construct. We then mutated all the possible FLI1 DNA-binding sites as shown in Fig. 1A to see whether we could abrogate the ability of EWS-FLI1 to increase activity of the GLI1 promoter. When we expressed both the WT and mutant GLI1 promoter luciferase constructs in COS7 cells cotransfected with EWS-FLI1, we saw a 4-fold decrease in activity that reduced the activity back to the WT control. EWS-FLI1 Enhances GLI1 Protein Expression and Activity in COS7 Cells-Following the observation of an increase in GLI1 promoter activity upon EWS-FLI1 expression, we then looked at the effects of expressing EWS-FLI1 on GLI1 protein expression and the activity of GLI1 as a transcription factor. We transfected COS7 cells with EWS-FLI1 and examined endogenous GLI1 protein expression by Western blot. We observed a 1.4-fold increase in GLI1 protein expression when COS7 cells expressed EWS-FLI1 protein (Fig. 2A). COS7 cells were also cotransfected with EWS-FLI1 and a luciferase reporter construct (pGL38xGLI) that contains a GLI1-responsive promoter to examine the effect of EWS-FLI1 on GLI1 transcriptional activity (Fig. 2B). The pGL38xGLI construct contains eight GLI DNA-binding sites attached to the chicken lens crystalline promoter followed by the luciferase gene. The difference between the construct used in Fig. 1 and pGL38xGLI used in Fig. 2 is that one is measuring activity of the GLI1 gene promoter (GLI1/pGL3) stimulated by EWS-FLI1 protein, and the other is measuring activity of a GLI1-responsive promoter (pGL38xGLI) stimulated by GLI1 protein. Expression of EWS-FLI1 in COS7 cells significantly increased pGL38xGLI reporter activity (Fig. 2B). These data further suggest that EWS-FLI1 induces GLI1 protein expression to a functionally significant level, which provides enhanced GLI1 transcriptional activity. To rule out that the observed increase in the GLI1-responsive promoter (pGL38xGLI) may be due to direct transcriptional activity by EWS-FLI1, we used pharmacological inhibitors of GLI1 protein (Fig. 2B). We used NSC75503, which has been previously characterized as a specific inhibitor of GLI1 transcriptional activity (37Lauth M. Bergstrom A. Shimokawa T. Toftgard R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8455-8460Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). We also used cyclopamine, which is a Smoothened antagonist (38Taipale J. Chen J.K. Cooper M.K. Wang B. Mann R.K. Milenkovic L. Scott M.P. Beachy P.A. Nature. 2000; 406: 1005-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar). Cyclopamine was expected to have little to no effect on GLI1 activation by EWS-FLI1, because EWS-FLI1 acts downstream of Smoothened to activate GLI1. When COS7 cells were transfected with EWS-FLI1 and treated with the GLI1 inhibitor 75503, we observed a significant decrease in GLI1 transcriptional activity as measured by the pGL38xGLI reporter construct (Fig. 2B). Cyclopamine decreased GLI1 activity as well but to a much lesser extent (Fig. 2B). These results suggested that the EWS-FLI1-induced increase in GLI1 responsive promoter (pGL38xGLI) activity is mediated by an increase in expression of activated GLI1 protein. GLI1 Is Expressed in ESFT Cell Lines-Because the GLI1 promoter is activated by EWS-FLI1, we explored whether GLI1 protein is expressed in ESFT cell lines. We surveyed GLI1 protein expression in a panel of six ESFT cell lines that express EWS-FLI1. HepG2, a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, was used as a negative control because it expresses low levels of GLI1 protein. All six ESFT cell lines examined had considerably higher GLI1 expression compared with HepG2 cells as determined by densitometric analysis of Western blots. On average, ESFT cells had a 6.2-fold higher level of GLI1 protein expression when compared with HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A). We also performed RT-PCR analysis for Hedgehog pathway components on ESFT and HepG2 cells (Fig. 3B). All ESFT cells lines express GLI1 as well as the GLI target GAS1. A4573 and ES925 also express the GLI target Hhip. HepG2 cells do not express any GLI genes or GAS1. β-Actin was used as a positive control. We therefore conclude that GLI1 is expressed in a majority of ESFT cell lines, which suggests that EWS-FLI1-induced GLI1 expression is a biologically relevant observation. Knockdown of EWS-FLI1 Decreases GLI1 Protein Levels-A673 cells stably transfected with shRNA for EWS-FLI1 were treated with tetracycline to induce shRNA expression. A673 cells were used because they are the only ESFT cell line that can tolerate EWS-FLI1 knockdown. After 96 h EWS-FLI1 expression was decreased upon tetracycline treatment in the shRNA cells (Fig. 3C). When EWS-FLI1 expression was decreased this caused a subsequent 45% decrease in GLI1 levels as determined by densitometric analysis. These data further suggest that EWS-FLI1 alters GLI1 protein expression in ESFT cells. Knockdown of GLI1 in ESFT Cells Decreases Proliferation-TC-71 and TC-32 cells were electroporated with control scrambled or GLI1 siRNA. GLI1 siRNA reduced GLI1 protein in TC-32 cells by 78% and in TC-71 cells by 59% (Fig. 4). After 3 days, TC-71 cells expressing GLI1 siRNA had a 43% decrease in proliferation compared with the control (Fig. 4). The result was statistically significant. After 5 days, TC-32 cells expressing GLI1 siRNA had a 30% decrease in proliferation compared with the control (Fig. 4). This result was also statistically significant. These experiments were repeated four times, and GLI1 protein expression was reduced on average 50% with a standard deviation of 25.7% for TC-32 cells and 55% with a standard deviation of 10.2% for TC-71 cells. Proliferation on average was inhibited 31% with a standard deviation of 14.90% for TC-32 cells and a 36% decrease in proliferation with a standard deviation of 10.0% for TC-71 cells. Targeting GLI1 with a Small Molecule Inhibitor Decreases ESFT Proliferation and Soft Agar Colony Formation-We next examined whether GLI1 plays a role in EWS-FLI1 tumorigenesis. The ESFT cell lines TC-32 and TC-71 were treated with the GLI1 inhibitor 75503 at 10 and 30 μm in 1% DMSO. HepG2 cells were used as a negative control to show that the observed effect was not due to general cell toxicity. After 72 h, the 75503 compound at 10 μm had 43% inhibition of cellular proliferation in TC-71 cells and 31% inhibition in TC-32 cells. There was no growth inhibition in the negative control, HepG2 cells. At a concentration of 30 μm, the 75503 compound had 60% inhibition in TC-71 cells, 84% inhibition in TC-32 cells, and 23% inhibition in HepG2 cells (Fig. 5A). We also treated TC-32 and TC-71 cells with cyclopamine at 10 and 30 μm and compared it with the 75503 compound (Fig. 5B). Cyclopamine was expected to have a smaller effect in inhibiting proliferation of ESFT cells because the EWS-FLI1 acts downstream of Smoothened to activate GLI1. We were able to show that at both 10 and 30 μm, the 75503 compound inhibited proliferation to a greater extent in TC-71 and TC-32 cells compared with cyclopamine. At 10 μm the 75503 compound had 43% inhibition in TC-71 and 31% inhibition in TC-32 cells, both of which were significantly be"

We develop a quantitative model that treats the generation of these fields in an analogous way to that of electronic shot noise, and use this model to specifically address the cause of this $1/f^2$ Brownian noise. The model gives way to two analytically tractable solutions, both displaying Brownian noise: 1) uncorrelated cells that display sharp initial activity, whose extracellular fields slowly decay and 2) rapidly firing, temporally correlated cells that generate UP-DOWN states."
https://openalex.org/W2136712209,"Salicylate (SA, 2-hydroxybenzoate) is a phytohormone best known for its role as a critical mediator of local and systemic plant defense responses. In response to pathogens such as <i>Pseudomonas syringae</i>, SA is synthesized and activates widespread gene expression. In <i>gh3.12/pbs3</i> mutants of <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, induced total SA accumulation is significantly compromised as is SA-dependent gene expression and plant defense. AtGH3 subfamily I and II members have been shown to conjugate phytohormone acyl substrates to amino acids <i>in vitro</i>, with this role supported by <i>in planta</i> analyses. Here we sought to determine the <i>in vitro</i> biochemical activity and kinetic properties of GH3.12/avrPphB susceptible 3 (PBS3), a member of the uncharacterized AtGH3 subfamily III. Using a novel high throughput adenylation assay, we characterized the acyl substrate preference of PBS3. We found PBS3 favors 4-substituted benzoates such as 4-aminobenzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate, with moderate activity on benzoate and no observed activity with 2-substituted benzoates. Similar to known GH3 enzymes, PBS3 catalyzes the conjugation of specific amino acids (<i>e.g.</i> Glu) to its preferred acyl substrates. Kinetic analyses indicate 4-aminobenzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate are preferred acyl substrates as PBS3 exhibits both higher affinities (apparent <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> = 153 and 459 μm, respectively) and higher catalytic efficiencies (<i>k</i><sub>cat</sub><i>/K<sub>m</sub></i> = 0.0179 and 0.0444 μm<sup>–1</sup> min<sup>–1</sup>, respectively) with these acyl substrates compared with benzoate (apparent <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> = 867 μm, <i>k</i><sub>cat</sub>/<i>K<sub>m</sub></i> = 0.0046 μm<sup>–1</sup> min<sup>–1</sup>). Notably, SA specifically and reversibly inhibits PBS3 activity with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 15 μm. This suggests a general mechanism for the rapid, reversible regulation of GH3 activity and small molecule cross-talk. For PBS3, this may allow for coordination of flux through diverse chorismate-derived pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2100582120,"The differentiation of resident fibroblasts to myofibroblasts is central to wound healing. In the context of organ fibrosis, however, persistence of these myofibroblasts is associated with progressive disease. This study examines mechanisms controlling the maintenance of the myofibroblast phenotype. Myofibroblasts were induced by adding transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) (10 ng/ml) to fibroblasts for 72 h. The phenotype was maintained for up to 120 h following removal of TGF-β1. Western blot for pSmad2 and -3 demonstrated persistent phosphorylation despite removal of exogenous TGF-β1. This persistence was because of autocrine synthesis of TGF-β1, which was inhibited by both anti-TGF-β1 antibody and the ALK5 inhibitor SB431542. Persistence of phenotype was also associated with increased hyaluronan (HA) generation, synthesis of the hyaladherin TSG6, and HA pericellular coat formation. These were all inhibited by TGF-β receptor blockade. To further investigate the importance of HA synthesis, 4-methylumbelliferone was used to deplete the cytoplasmic pool of UDP-glucuronic acid, essential for HA chain elongation. This prevented formation of the pericellular HA matrix and decreased expression of α-SMA. 4-Methylumbelliferone had no effect, however, on Smad2 and -3 phosphorylation. Similarly inhibition of HAS2 by short interfering RNA prevented phenotypic activation without altering TGF-β1-dependent Smad phosphorylation, thus suggesting that HA-dependent regulation of cell phenotype was independent of Smad activation. These data suggest that myofibroblasts in areas of fibrosis maintain their own phenotype through autocrine TGF-β1 action and that extracellular HA matrices are an essential mediator of this. We propose a model in which the formation of the pericellular HA matrix regulates the outcome of Smad-dependent autocrine TGF-β1-activated signaling, and therefore persistence of the myofibroblast phenotype.

Increased activity and proliferation of resident fibroblasts are central to wound healing and fibrosis in all tissues. The fibroblast is the most abundant cell type in normal connective tissues and plays a central role in the synthesis, degradation, and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, both in health and disease. Although fibroblastic cells are traditionally considered to have a relatively uniform morphology, they are endowed with multiple functional properties, and several cytoskeletal differentiation markers have been described, which suggest that a phenotypic heterogeneity, related to distinct biological functions, also exists (1Sappino A.P. Schürch W. Gabbiani G. Lab. Investig. 1990; 63: 144-161PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts normally express only two actin isoforms (β and γ). Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that in areas of fibrosis a sub-group of fibroblasts exists, which expresses the smooth muscle isoform of α-actin (α-SMA) 3The abbreviations used are: α-SMA, smooth muscle isoform of α-actin; TGF-β1, transforming growth factor-β1; 4MU, 4-methylumbelliferone; HA, hyaluronan; HAS, HA synthase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; siRNA, short interfering RNA; Q-PCR, quantitative PCR; ANOVA, analysis of variance; HABP, HA-binding protein; HSD, Honest Significant Difference. that is normally expressed constitutively only in smooth muscle cells. It is now clear that these cells represent a sub-population of specialized fibroblasts that have developed a contractile phenotype that is expressed in a number of pathological settings associated with wound healing and fibrosis (2Gabbiani G. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar). These myofibroblasts are responsible for closure of wounds and for the formation of the collagen-rich scar. In addition, their presence in tissues has been established as a marker of progressive fibrosis (3Desmouliere A. Gabbiani G. Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed.

The cytokine transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is recognized as a mediator of wound healing, and its aberrant expression has also been widely implicated in progressive tissue fibrosis (7Desmouliere A.

In addition to its direct effect on extracellular matrix turnover, in vitro and in vivo evidence suggest that it is the primary driving force in fibroblast-myofibroblast differentiation (10Desmouliere A.

Cell Res. 2003; 282: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar).

The mechanism by which stability of myofibroblast phenotype is maintained is, however, poorly understood. Hyaluronan (HA) is a ubiquitous connective tissue glycos-aminoglycan synthesized by HA synthase (HAS) enzymes of which three vertebrate genes have been isolated and characterized as follows: HAS1, HAS2, and HAS3 (12Spicer A.P.

It is known to play a major role in regulating cell-cell adhesion (14Kosaki R. Watanabe K. Yamaguchi Y. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1141-1145PubMed Google Scholar), migration (15Itano N. Atsumi F. Sawai T.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1004-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), and it therefore plays an important role in wound healing. In addition, it is involved in mediating cellular responses to TGF-β. For example, our recent studies in epithelial cells have demonstrated that HA modulates TGF-β signaling following interaction with its receptor, CD44 (21Ito T. Williams J.D. Fraser D.J. Phillips A.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 1979-1988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 22Ito T. Williams J.D. Fraser D.J. Phillips A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25326-25332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that phenotypic conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts is associated with major changes in the production and metabolism of HA (23Jenkins R.H. Thomas G.J. Williams J.D. Steadman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41453-41460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Specifically, they have been shown to accumulate larger amounts of intracellular and extracellular HA and to assemble larger HA pericellular matrices. Inhibition of HA synthesis resulted in abrogation of TGF-β1-mediated myofibroblastic phenotypic conversion demonstrating a key role in facilitating fibroblast-myofibroblast transition (24Meran S. Thomas D. Stephens P. Martin J. Bowen T. Phillips A. Steadman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25687-25697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Furthermore, fibroblast HA generation dictates the end result of activation of TGF-β1-dependent signaling intermediates (25Meran S. Thomas D.W. Stephens P. Enoch S. Martin J. Steadman R. Phillips A.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 6530-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that HA is a critical regulator of fibroblast cell function. However, its role in the maintenance of myofibroblast phenotype has not been examined. The aim of the work outlined in this study is to examine the factors that maintain the stability of the myofibroblast phenotype. In particular the work focuses on the importance of HA and its relationship with TGF-β1 in this process. Materials-All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. PCR and Q-PCR reagents and primers were purchased from Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems (Cheshire, UK). Cell Culture-Monolayers of human lung fibroblasts (AG02262, Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ) were cultured in a 1:1 (v/v) mix of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 (Sigma) containing 2 mm l-glutamine (Sigma), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Sigma), supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Biosera, East Sussex, UK). Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, and fresh growth medium was added to the cells every 3 days until confluent. The cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h before use in experiments. Fibroblast differentiation was mediated by addition of TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml) for 72 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. Resultant myofibroblasts were then washed thoroughly with calcium/magnesium-free PBS. All experiments, unless otherwise stated, were performed in serum-free medium. All experiments were undertaken using cells at passage 8–10. In all experiments nondifferentiated fibroblasts were used as a control. Immunocytochemistry-Cells were grown to 70% confluence in 8-well permanox chamber slides. The culture medium was removed, and the cells washed with sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For immunostaining the cells were fixed in acetone/methanol (1:1 v/v) for 10 min at room temperature. Following fixation, slides were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h prior to a further washing step with PBS. Subsequently, the slides were incubated with murine monoclonal anti-α-SMA clone 1A4 and diluted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS (final dilution 1:30) for 2 h at room temperature. Following a further washing step, slides were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Cambridgeshire, UK) diluted 1:40 in 0.1% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then mounted and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. Quantitative PCR-Q-PCR was used to assess TGF-β1, TSG-6, HAS2, and α-SMA mRNA expression in human lung fibroblasts. The cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and washed with PBS prior to lysis with TRI Reagent and RNA purification according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcription was performed using the random hexamer method. 1 μg of RNA was added to 1 μl of 100 μm random hexamers, 2 μl of 10× PCR buffer, and 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol. The solution was heated to 95 °C for 5 min followed by 4 °C for 2 min. 1 μl (40 units/μl) of ribonuclease inhibitor RNasin (Promega) and 1 μl (200 units/μl) of Superscript were added to each sample and mixed. The solution was incubated at 20 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 40 min, and then 95 °C for 5 min on a GeneAmp PCR system 9700. As a negative control, reverse transcription was performed with sterile H2O replacing the RNA sample. PCR performed using the 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR system from Applied Biosciences. PCR was carried out in a final volume of 20 μl/sample, 1 μl of reverse transcription product, 1 μl of target gene primers and probe (commercially designed and purchased from Applied Biosciences), 10 μl of Taqman Universal PCR Mastermix, and 8 μl of sterile H2O. Amplification was carried out using a cycle of 95 °C for 1 s and 60 °C for 20 s for 40 cycles. As a negative control, PCR was performed with sterile H2O replacing the cDNA sample. PCR was simultaneously done for ribosomal RNA (primers and probe commercially designed and purchased from Applied Biosciences) as a standard reference gene. The comparative CT method was used for relative quantification of gene expression. The CT (threshold cycle where amplification is in the linear range of the amplification curve) value for the standard reference gene (ribosomal RNA) was subtracted from the target gene CT to obtain the ΔCT (ΔCT). The mean ΔCT values for similar samples were then calculated. The expression of the target gene in experimental samples relative to expression in control samples was then calculated using the following Equation 1,2-(ΔCT(1)-ΔCT(2))Eq. 1 where ΔCT(1) is the mean ΔCT calculated for the experimental samples, and ΔCT(2) is the mean ΔCT calculated for the control samples. Western Blot Analysis-Western blot analysis was used to assess expression of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3. Cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and rinsed with cold PBS. Cells were then lysed using 1% protease inhibitor mixture, 1% phenymethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% sodium orthovanadate in RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The samples were scraped, collected, and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay, and the samples were stored at –70 °C until use. Equal amounts of protein were mixed with equal volumes of reducing SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min at 95 °C before loading onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was carried out under reducing conditions at 150 V for 1 h, and the separated proteins were then transferred at 150 V over 90 min to a nitrocellulose membrane (GE Healthcare). The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% nonfat powdered milk for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody (anti-phosphorylated Smad3 or anti-phosphorylated Smad2, diluted 1:1000 or 1:500, respectively, in TBS; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) at 4 °C overnight. The blots were subsequently washed with TBS containing 1% Tween and then incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase, 1:10,000 dilution in TBS containing 5% nonfat powdered milk; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. TGF-β1 ELISA-Cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes, and the TGF-β1 concentration in the cell culture supernatant was determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked TGF-β1-binding protein assay (TGF-β1 “DuoSet ELISA Development System”;R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK). Prior to the assay, any latent TGF-β1 in the samples was acid-activated using 1 m HCl, and the acid then neutralized with 1.2 m NaOH, 0.5 m HEPES. TGFβ1 Bioassay and Transient Transfection-TGF-β1 activity was assessed by bioassay as described previously (26Fraser D.J. Brunskill N.J. Phillips A.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 2565-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The Smad-responsive promoter (SBE)4-Lux was a gift from Aristidis Moustakas (Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden). For transfection of the reporter construct, HK-2 cells were seeded onto a 12-well plate and grown to ∼70% confluence. Cells were growth-arrested in serum-free medium for 4 h and then transfected with 0.9 μg of the Smad responsive promoter-luciferase construct, using the mixed lipofection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at a ratio of 3 μl of Lipofectamine to 1 μg of DNA in serum-free and insulin-free medium. Transfection efficiency was monitored by co-transfection with a Renilla vector. 24 h after transfection, transfection medium was removed; cells were washed with PBS, and then condition media were collected from fibroblasts, and myofibroblasts were added to the HK-2 cells for a further 6 h. Following lysis of the cells in lysis buffer (supplied in Dual-Glo luciferase activity kit (Promega Ltd.)), luciferase activity was then assayed using the Dual-Glo luciferase assay kit as outlined in the manufacturer’s protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla activity. Visualization of Pericellular HA by Particle Exclusion Assay-The exclusion of horse erythrocytes was used to visualize the HA pericellular coat. Formalized horse erythrocytes were washed in PBS and centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 7 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in serum-free medium at an approximate density of 1 × 108 erythrocytes/ml. 500 μl of this suspension was added to each 35-mm dish containing sub-confluent cells and swirled gently for even distribution. The dishes were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to allow the erythrocytes to settle around the cells. Control cells were incubated with 200 μg/ml bovine testicular hyaluronidase in serum-free medium for 30 min prior to the addition of formalized horse erythrocytes. On settling, the erythrocytes were excluded from zones around the cells with HA pericellular coats. This was viewed under the microscope as an area of erythrocyte exclusion. Zones of exclusion were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 135 inverted microscope. Because of the elongated shape of the cells, the exclusion zone at some areas of the cell was not visible. Therefore, the width of the exclusion zone was calculated at the widest point of the cell (usually the nucleus). Determination of HA Concentration-Cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes, and the HA concentration in the cell culture supernatant was determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked HA-binding protein assay (HA “Chugai” quantitative test kit; Corgenix, Petersborough, UK). The assay used microwells coated with a highly specific HA-binding protein (HABP) from bovine cartilage to capture HA and an enzyme-conjugated version of HABP to detect and measure HA in the samples. Briefly, diluted samples and HA reference solutions were incubated in HABP-coated microwells allowing binding of the HA in the samples to the immobilized HABP. The wells were then washed, and HABP conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was added to the wells forming complexes with bound HA. Following a second washing step, a chromogenic substrate (tetramethylbenzidine/H2O2) was added to develop a colored reaction. Stopping solution was added to the wells, and the intensity of the resulting color was measured in optical density units using a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. HA concentrations were calculated by comparing the absorbance of the sample against a reference curve prepared from the reagent blank and five HA reference solutions (50, 100, 200, 500, and 800 ng/ml) included in the kit. The assay is sensitive to 10 ng/ml, with no cross-reactivity with other glycos-aminoglycan compounds. siRNA Transfection of Fibroblasts and Myofibroblasts-Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts were cultured to ∼50% confluence in 12-well culture plates. Medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed thoroughly with PBS before being replaced with 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 growth medium containing no antibiotics. Transient transfection of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts with specific siRNA oligonucleotides (HAS2) was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 2 μl of transfection reagent was diluted in 98 μl of Opti-MEM reduced growth medium (Invitrogen) and left to incubate at room temperature for 5 min. siRNA oligonucleotides were diluted in Opti-MEM reduced growth medium to give a final concentration of 1.2 μm in a total volume of 100 μl. The transfection reagent mix and the siRNA mix were then combined and incubated at room temperature for a further 20 min. The newly formed transfection complexes (200 μl) were added to the medium in the wells of the culture plate so that the final siRNA concentration was 100 nm. The plate was then rocked gently to ensure adequate mixing of the complexes and then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h. After this time the medium was aspirated and replaced with serum-free Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F-12 growth medium with no antibiotics. This was incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for a further 24 h to obtain maximum transfection efficiency. The success of HAS2 knockdown by the siRNA was confirmed by Q-PCR using primers specific to HAS2. Statistical Analysis-Paired Student’s t tests were performed for experiments with only one variable. For experiments with multiple variables, one-way ANOVA was used to identify statistical differences, followed by Tukey’s Honest Significant Difference (HSD) method to paired data. The Tukey’s HSD method applied includes corrections for multiple testing and an adjustment for unbalanced designs. The results are expressed as the means ± S.E. All data were analyzed using software (SPSS 14.0 Chicago, IL), and p < 0.05 was considered significant. Stimulation of Fibroblasts Results in a Stable Myofibroblast Phenotype-Phenotypic conversion of fibroblasts was performed as reported previously (11Evans R.A. Tian Y.C. Steadman R. Phillips A.O. Exp. Cell Res. 2003; 282: 90-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 23Jenkins R.H. Thomas G.J. Williams J.D. Steadman R. J. Biol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 25687-25697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly fibroblasts were stimulated by the addition of recombinant TGF-β1 (10 ng/ml). Activation to a myofibroblastic phenotype was monitored by quantitation of α-SMA mRNA (Fig. 1A). As demonstrated previously, maximal induction of α-SMA was seen after 72 h. Subsequently, the stability of phenotype was confirmed in this model following removal of TGF-β1 containing cell culture medium and addition of serum-free medium alone for a further 120 h and monitoring of α-SMA mRNA by Q-PCR. As demonstrated previously, stability of phenotype was demonstrated by significant greater expression of α-SMA following removal of TGF-β1 as compared with the expression of α-SMA in an unstimulated fibroblast (Fig. 1B). Q-PCR data were also supported by immunohistochemical analysis of α-SMA. There was no detectable α-SMA expression in fibroblasts at any time point (Fig. 1, C and E), whereas positive staining for α-SMA in myofibroblast was apparent at the time of removal of TGF-β1 (Fig. 1D) and for up to 120 h following its removal (Fig. 1F). Maintenance of Myofibroblast Phenotype Is Associated with Smad Phosphorylation and TGF-β1 Autoinduction-Given the importance of TGF-β1 in the phenotypic conversion of fibroblasts, we next examined activation of Smad proteins and the generation of TGF-β1 by myofibroblasts. Fibroblasts were stimulated for 72 h to drive myofibroblastic phenotypic conversion. TGF-β1 was subsequently removed, and serum-free medium was added for a further 72 h. In the myofibroblast, persistent activation of the TGF-β1 signaling intermediate R-Smad, Smad3 was apparent as phosphorylation of Smad3 was seen at all time points following removal of TGF-β1. In contrast, no phosphorylation of Smad3 was seen in unstimulated fibroblasts (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation of the R-Smad was also associated with a reduction in the expression of total Smad3 protein as assessed by Western blot analysis. Following phenotypic conversion, TGF-β1 generation (in the absence of exogenous TGF-β1) was examined at the levels of both transcription (Q-PCR) and protein synthesis (ELISA). At all time points studied, expression of TGF-β1 mRNA was significantly greater than that seen in an unstimulated fibroblast (Fig. 2B). The induction of TGF-β1 mRNA was also accompanied by a significant increase in the concentration of TGF-β1 in the cell culture medium of myofibroblasts as compared with fibroblasts (Fig. 2C). TGF-β1 is generated in a biologically inactive latent form, activation of which may be associated with proteolytic processing of the latent complex (27Sato Y. Okada M. Seguchi T. Kuwano M. Sato S. Furuya A. Hanai N. Tamaoki T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1249-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 28Yu Q. Stamenkovic I. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 163-176PubMed Google Scholar), or also conformation change of the latent complex mediated by integrin binding (29Munger J.S. Huang X. Kawaskatsu H. Griffiths M.J.D. Dalton S.L.

The activity of the TGF-β1 generated by myofibroblasts was assessed in a previously described bioassay (26Fraser D.J. Brunskill N.J. Phillips A.O. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 2565-2574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium from myofibroblasts was added to cells transiently transfected with a Smad-responsive promoter-luciferase construct. There was significant increase in reporter activity following addition of myofibroblast condition medium as compared with fibroblast conditioned medium confirming the presence of increased concentrations of biologically active TGF-β1 (Fig. 3A). In contrast there was no difference in the level of expression of the Alk5 TGF-β receptor as assessed by Western analysis (Fig. 3B). The role of TGF-β1 activity in myofibroblast maintenance of phosphorylation of Smad was subsequently examined by Western blot analysis of phosphorylation of either Smad2 or Smad3 following the addition of the TGF-β receptor/Alk 5 inhibitor, SB431542 (Sigma) (Fig. 3, C and D). Myofibroblast TGF-β1 signaling was inhibited by addition of SB431542 (10 μm) immediately after the removal of endogenous TGF-β1 following myofibroblastic differentiation. The effects on Smad signaling were subsequently followed for 120 h. In contrast to the untreated myofibroblast, no phosphorylation of either Smad2 or Smad3 was detectable in the SB431542-treated cells, thus confirming that Smad activation was the result of autocrine TGF-β1 generation. Finally, the role of autocrine TGF-β1 generation in the maintenance of myofibroblast phenotype was determined by quantitation of α-SMA mRNA by Q-PCR (Fig. 4A) and protein by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 4, B–D) following inhibition of TGF-β1 signaling using the Alk5 inhibitor. The results demonstrated that inhibition of TGF-β R activity was associated with marked reduction of α-SMA expression. Collectively, these data suggest that induction of autocrine TGF-β1 synthesis in the myofibroblast leads to activation of R-Smads and subsequent maintenance of the phenotype of the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2059106630,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and associated liver cirrhosis represent a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. TGF-beta is an important driver of liver fibrogenesis and cancer; however, its actual impact in human cancer progression is still poorly known. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of HCC-derived HCV core natural variants on cancer progression through their impact on TGF-beta signaling.We provide evidence that HCC-derived core protein expression in primary human or mouse hepatocyte alleviates TGF-beta responses in terms or growth inhibition or apoptosis. Instead, in these hepatocytes TGF-beta was still able to induce an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process that contributes to the promotion of cell invasion and metastasis. Moreover, we demonstrate that different thresholds of Smad3 activation dictate the TGF-beta responses in hepatic cells and that HCV core protein, by decreasing Smad3 activation, may switch TGF-beta growth inhibitory effects to tumor promoting responses.Our data illustrate the capacity of hepatocytes to develop EMT and plasticity under TGF-beta, emphasize the role of HCV core protein in the dynamic of these effects and provide evidence for a paradigm whereby a viral protein implicated in oncogenesis is capable to shift TGF-beta responses from cytostatic effects to EMT development."
https://openalex.org/W1967233082,"Background Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) are global health problems. We sought to determine the characteristics, prevalence, and relative frequency of transmission of MDR and XDR TB in Shanghai, one of the largest cities in Asia. Methods TB is diagnosed in district TB hospitals in Shanghai, China. Drug susceptibility testing for first-line drugs was performed for all culture positive TB cases, and tests for second-line drugs were performed for MDR cases. VNTR-7 and VNTR-16 were used to genotype the strains, and prior treatment history and treatment outcomes were determined for each patient. Results There were 4,379 culture positive TB cases diagnosed with drug susceptibility test results available during March 2004 through November 2007. 247 (5.6%) were infected with a MDR strain of M. tuberculosis and 11 (6.3%) of the 175 MDR patients whose isolate was tested for susceptibility to second-line drugs, were XDR. More than half of the patients with MDR and XDR were newly diagnosed and had no prior history of TB treatment. Nearly 57% of the patients with MDR were successfully treated. Discussion Transmission of MDR and XDR strains is a serious problem in Shanghai. While a history of prior anti-TB treatment indicates which individuals may have acquired MDR or XDR TB, it does not accurately predict which TB patients have disease caused by transmission of MDR and XDR strains. Therefore, universal drug susceptibility testing is recommended for new and retreatment TB cases."
https://openalex.org/W2092609668,"For a retrovirus such as HIV to be infectious, a properly formed capsid is needed; however, unusually among viruses, retrovirus capsids are highly variable in structure. According to the fullerene conjecture, they are composed of hexamers and pentamers of capsid protein (CA), with the shape of a capsid varying according to how the twelve pentamers are distributed and its size depending on the number of hexamers. Hexamers have been studied in planar and tubular arrays, but the predicted pentamers have not been observed. Here we report cryo-electron microscopic analyses of two in-vitro-assembled capsids of Rous sarcoma virus. Both are icosahedrally symmetric: one is composed of 12 pentamers, and the other of 12 pentamers and 20 hexamers. Fitting of atomic models of the two CA domains into the reconstructions shows three distinct inter-subunit interactions. These observations substantiate the fullerene conjecture, show how pentamers are accommodated at vertices, support the inference that nucleation is a crucial morphologic determinant, and imply that electrostatic interactions govern the differential assembly of pentamers and hexamers. Retrovirus capsids are polymorphic, consisting of variable hexamer and pentamer aggregates with structures thought to resemble fullerenes. A cryo-electon microscopy/molecular modelling study of capsids assembled from the full-length Rous sarcoma virus capsid protein now confirms the existence of fullerene-like capsid architecture. Two different forms were observed, one composed of 12 pentamers and the other of 12 pentamers and 20 hexamers. Retrovirus capsids are polymorphic, consisting of variable hexamer and pentamer aggregates that are thought to reflect fullerenes. This paper reports the cryo-electron microscopy analysis of RSV capsid protein visualizing pentamers, and confirms that retrovirus capsid has a fullerene-based architecture."
https://openalex.org/W2135145267,"Sexual dimorphisms are typically attributed to the hormonal differences arising once sex differentiation has occurred. However, in some sexually dimorphic diseases that differ in frequency but not severity, the differences cannot be logically connected to the sex hormones. Therefore, we asked whether any aspect of sexual dimorphism could be attributed to chromosomal rather than hormonal differences. Cells taken from mice at d 10.5 postconception (PC) before sexual differentiation, at d 17.5 PC after the first embryonic assertion of sexual hormones, and at postnatal day 17 (puberty) were cultured and exposed to 400 microM ethanol or 20 microM camptothecin or to infection with influenza A virus (multiplicity of infection of 5). The results showed that untreated male and female cells of the same age grew at similar rates and manifested similar morphology. However, they responded differently to the applied stressors, even before the production of fetal sex hormones. Furthermore, microarray and qPCR analyses of the whole 10.5 PC embryos also revealed differences in gene expression between male and female tissues. Likewise, the exposure of cells isolated from fetuses and adolescent mice to the stressors and/or sex hormones yielded expression patterns that reflected chromosomal sex, with ethanol feminizing male cells and masculinizing female cells. We conclude that cells differ innately according to sex irrespective of their history of exposure to sex hormones. These differences may have consequences in the course of sexually dimorphic diseases and their therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2148524250,"Hyaluronic acid is widely used in the treatment of osteoarthritis and exerts significant chondroprotective effects. The exact mechanisms of its chondroprotective action are not yet fully elucidated. Human articular chondrocytes actively produce reactive oxygen and nitrogen species capable of causing cellular dysfunction and death. A growing body of evidence indicates that mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondrial DNA damage play a causal role in disorders linked to excessive generation of oxygen free radicals. We hypothesized that the chondroprotective effects of hyaluronic acid on oxidatively stressed chondrocytes are due to preservation of mitochondrial function and amelioration of mitochondria-driven apoptosis. When primary human chondrocyte cultures were exposed to reactive oxygen or nitrogen species generators, mitochondrial DNA damage along with mitochondrial dysfunction and mitochondria-driven apoptosis accumulated as a consequence. In addition, cytokine-treated primary human chondrocytes showed increased levels of mitochondrial DNA damage. Pretreatment of chondrocytes with hyaluronic acid caused a decrease of mitochondrial DNA damage, enhanced mitochondrial DNA repair capacity and cell viability, preservation of ATP levels, and amelioration of apoptosis. The results of these studies demonstrate that enhanced chondrocyte survival and improved mitochondrial function under conditions of oxidative injury are probably important therapeutic mechanisms for the actions of hyaluronic acid in osteoarthritis."

https://openalex.org/W2082168591,"Since P450scc transforms 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) to 7-dehydropregnenolone (7DHP) in vitro, we investigated sequential 7DHC metabolism by adrenal glands ex vivo. There was a rapid, time- and dose-dependent metabolism of 7DHC by adrenals from rats, pigs, rabbits and dogs with production of more polar 5,7-dienes as detected by RP-HPLC. Based on retention time (RT), UV spectra and mass spectrometry, we identified the major products common to all tested species as 7DHP, 22-hydroxy-7DHC and 20,22-dihydroxy-7DHC. The involvement of P450scc in adrenal metabolic transformation was confirmed by the inhibition of this process by DL-aminoglutethimide. The metabolism of 7DHC with subsequent production of 7DHP was stimulated by forscolin indicating involvement of cAMP dependent pathways. Additional minor products of 7DHC metabolism that were more polar than 7DHP were identified as 17-hydroxy-7DHP (in pig adrenals but not those of rats) and as pregna-4,7-diene-3,20-dione (7-dehydroprogesterone). Both products represented the major identifiable products of 7DHP metabolism in adrenal glands. Studies with purified enzymes show that StAR protein likely transports 7DHC to the inner mitochondrial membrane, that 7DHC can compete effectively with cholesterol for the substrate binding site on P450scc and that the catalytic efficiency of 3βHSD for 7DHP (Vm/Km) is 40% of that for pregnenolone. Skin mitochondria are capable of transforming 7DHC to 7DHP and the 7DHP is metabolized further by skin extracts. Finally, 7DHP, its photoderivative 20-oxopregnacalciferol, and pregnenolone exhibited biological activity in skin cells including inhibition of proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes, and melanoma cells. These findings define a novel steroidogenic pathway: 7DHC→22(OH)7DHC→20,22(OH)27DHC→7DHP, with potential further metabolism of 7DHP mediated by 3βHSD or CYP17, depending on mammalian species. The 5–7 dienal intermediates of the pathway can be a source of biologically active vitamin D3 derivatives after delivery to or production in the skin, an organ intermittently exposed to solar radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2058013358,"We recently demonstrated mitochondrial localization of estrogen receptor β (ERβ). We herein confirm the mitochondrial localization of ERβ by the loss of mitochondrial ERβ immunoreactivity in ERβ knockdown cells. A phenotype change characterized as an increase in resistance to oxidative stressors is associated with ERβ knockdown. ERβ knockdown results in a lower resting mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) and increase in resistance to hydrogen peroxide-induced Δψm depolarization in both immortal hippocampal cells and primary hippocampal neurons. ERβ knockdown cells maintained ATP concentrations despite insults that compromise ATP production and produce less mitochondrial superoxide under oxidative stress. Furthermore, similar mitochondrial phenotype changes were identified in primary hippocampal neurons derived from ERβ knock-out mice. These data demonstrate that ERβ is expressed in mitochondria and function as a mitochondrial vulnerability factor involved in Δψm maintenance, potentially through a mitochondrial transcription dependent mechanism.

Estrogens are known as the major female steroid hormones, which play a fundamental role in the female reproductive system. In recent years, estrogens have been appreciated as pleiotropic hormones that play roles in a wide variety of nonreproductive functions, such as cardiovascular function (1Stevenson J.C. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 74: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), memory and cognition (2Sherwin B.B. J. Psychiatry Neurosci. 1999; 24: 315-321PubMed Google Scholar), bone and mineral metabolism (3Compston J.E. Physiol.

Health Perspect. 1999; 107: 681-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that the majority of the biological effects of estrogens are mediated via two estrogen receptors (ERs) 2The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ERα, estrogen receptor α; ERβ, estrogen receptor β; Δψm, mitochondrial membrane potential; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ROS, reactive oxygen species; AAV-2, adeno-associated virus 2; GFP, green fluorescent protein.: estrogen receptor α (ERα) and estrogen receptor β (ERβ) (5Greene G.L.

Consistent with their wide biological roles in a variety of systems, both ERα and ERβ have been found to be widely distributed in different systems and tissues, including the reproductive system, central nervous system, cardiovascular system, gastrointestinal tract, urogenital tract, bone, and liver (9Gustafsson J.A. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 163: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). ERs have been widely accepted as transcriptional factors that belong to the nuclear receptor superfamily. Classically, it is believed that estrogens could modulate the expression of nuclear estrogen-responsive genes through both ERs. Also, estrogens could elicit rapid, nonnuclear action in a number of biological processes via nongenomic mechanisms mediated by ERs (10Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Consistently, extranuclear localization of both ERα and ERβ has been indicated (11McEwen B. Akama K. Alves S. Brake W.G.

In fact, increasing evidence has demonstrated that ERβ, while expressed in nuclei of some cell types, is mainly localized extranuclearly (14Herrick S.P. Waters E.M. Drake C.T. McEwen B.S. Milner T.A. Brain Res. 2006; 1121: 46-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 15Yang S.H. Liu R. Perez E.J. Wen Y. Stevens Jr., S.M. Valencia T. Brun-Zinkernagel A.M. Prokai L. Will Y. Dykens J. Koulen P.

It became clear, not long after its identification, that ERβ has biological roles distinct from those of ERα (9Gustafsson J.A. J. Endocrinol. 1999; 163: 379-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). ERα and ERβ are encoded by separate genes found at different chromosomal locations. While sharing a high homology in both the DNA binding and ligand binding domains, ERα and ERβ have very low sequence similarity in the N terminus (12%) and C terminus (9%), corresponding to the AF1 and AF2 domain, respectively (19Ascenzi P. Bocedi A. Marino M. Mol. Aspects Med. 2006; 27: 299-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar). Hence, it is not a surprise that ERβ has much lower nuclear transcriptional activity when compared with ERα (20Cowley S.M. Hoare S. Mosselman S. Parker M.G. J. Biol.

Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). There is accumulating evidence suggesting that mitochondria are also important targets for the actions of estrogens (18Chen J.Q. Yager J.D. Russo J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1746: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 27Felty Q. Roy D. J. Carcinog. 2005; 4: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Mitochondria play a fundamental role in cellular respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, and ionic homeostasis as well as synthesis of heme, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotide. Not only is endogenous estrogen synthesized in the mitochondria by aromatase, but exogenously added estrogen is also mainly transported into this organelle (27Felty Q. Roy D. J. Carcinog. 2005; 4: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 28Moats II, R.K. Ramirez V.D. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 58: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar).

Similar perinuclear punctate staining of ERβ has also been reported in a murine mammary epithelial cell line (HC11) and human fetal cortical neurons (33Fried G. Andersson E. Csoregh L. Enmark E.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 6605-6616Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The localization of ERβ in mitochondria suggests that ERβ may function as a mitochondrial component. In the current paper, we demonstrate that ERβ regulates a variety of mitochondrial functions, using a murine hippocampal cell line (HT-22) with permanent knockdown of ERβ by RNA interference (siRNA) and primary hippocampal neurons derived from ERβ knock-out mice. 17β-Estradiol was obtained from Steraloids, Inc. (Newport, RI). Tissue culture materials, MitoSOX™, JC1, Slow-Fade Light Antifade reagent, and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG were obtained from Invitrogen. Charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). ERβ (H-150) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc, Santa Cruz, CA) is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to amino acids 1-150 mapping at the amino terminus of ERβ of human origin. ERα (MC20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) is a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to the 20 amino acids mapping at the C terminus of ERα of human origin. Murine Hippocampus Cell Line-HT-22 cells (gift from Dr. David Schubert, Salk Institute, San Diego, CA), which are an immortalized murine hippocampal cell line, were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and 20 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C in a humid atmosphere with 5% CO2. Rat Primary Hippocampal Neuronal Culture-Sprague-Dawley rat embryos (Charles River, Wilmington, MA) of 18 days were externalized under halothane anesthesia. Hippocampi were dissected and harvested in 2 ml of preparation medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). The hippocampi were treated with trypsin. The tissue was then washed three times using washing medium (Hanks’ medium, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin) and individual cells were isolated by trituration 10 times using three different sizes of fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. The cells were harvested in seeding medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, 19% horse serum) and filtered through a 40-μm filter. The hippocampal cells were seeded on 25-mm coverslips. The cells were incubated in neurobasal medium (Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm glutamine, B27) under normal cell culture conditions. Primary Hippocampal Neuronal Culture from ERβ Knock-out Mice-Breeding pairs of ERβ knock-out mice (homozygous male and heterozygous female) were purchased from Taconic (Hudson, NY) (35Krege J.H. Hodgin J.B. Couse J.F. Enmark E. Warner M. Mahler J.F. Sar M. Korach K.S. Gustafsson J.A. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15677-15682Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar). Postnatal day 1 pups were euthanized, hippocampi were dissected separately from each pup, and neuronal cultures were produced as described above. The hippocampal cells were seeded on 25-mm coverslips and incubated in neurobasal medium. The cells were allowed to grow 4-7 days in culture, and mitochondrial membrane potential was analyzed by JC1 assay. For genotyping, total DNA was purified from the tail using a DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Three primers were used for PCR with the following sequences: Neo06122, 5′-GCA GCC TCT GTT CCA CAT ACA C-3′; mber-C1-2, 5′-CAT CCT TCA CAG GAC CAG ACA C-3′; mber-F2, 5′-TGG ACT CAC CAC GTA GGC TC-3′. The PCR product underwent electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel, and the separation patterns were photographed under UV illumination. Homozygous ERβ knockouts were characterized as a single 404 bp band, while heterozygous knock-out mice were seen as two bands with 404 and 356 bp. siRNA was used to permanently knock down ERβ in HT-22 cells. An ERβ siRNA gene-specific insert was designed that specified a nucleotide sequence from the ERβ cDNA (nucleotides 777-797) (gi:6978816), separated by a short spacer from the reverse complement of the same nucleotide sequence. For the construction of the expression vectors, the following oligonucleotides, that have homology sequence with ERβ, were designed. The selected sequences are homologous for humans, rats, and mice. Thus, the designed ERβ siRNA is effective for cells derived from all three species: 5′-GATCCCCtgtgaaggatgtaaggccttAGAGACATTaaggccttacatccttcacaTTTTTTGAATTCA-3′ and 5′-AGCTTGAATTCAAAAAAtgtgaaggatgtaaggccttAATGTCTCTaaggccttacatccttcacaGGG-3′. The synthetic oligonucleotides for ERβ siRNA were separately annealed, gelpurified, kinased, and ligated to HindIII and BglII-digested pBSH1RNApro to generate expression vectors of pBS-H1-ERβsiRNA (36Sarkar S.N. Das H.K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 87: 333-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The insertion of the synthetic oligonucleotides for ERβ siRNA was confirmed by sequencing using the M13F promoter (SeqWright DNA Technology Services, Houston, TX). The Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) method was used to transfect HT-22 cells with pBS-H1-ERβsiRNA or vector. Following transfection, HT-22 cells were selected for neomycin (G418) resistance (250 μg/ml). G418-resistant clones were isolated and expanded for Western blotting and immunocytochemistry of ERα and ERβ to confirm the knockdown of ERβ. The whole cell protein extracts were combined in Laemmli buffer with β-mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min. Mitochondrial samples (30 μg) were separated by 10% Tris-glycine polyacrylamide gel (Gradipore Ltd., Australia) and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Lanes containing Kaleidoscope prestained standards (Bio-Rad) were used to evaluate the size of the bands detected with ERα and ERβ. The membranes were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS and were incubated overnight at 4 °C with ERβ, ERα, or β-actin antibody. The membranes were repeatedly washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) prior to incubation with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. The blots were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent. Monolayer cells were washed with PBS (pH 7.4) and fixed with cold methanol for 15 min at -20 °C. Cells were rinsed several times in PBS and incubated in ice-cold Triton X-100 for 10 min to permeabilize the cells. Nonspecific sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 5% normal goat serum and 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Cells were then incubated with an ERβ antibody overnight at 4 °C. The sections were washed three times for 10 min each in PBS and then incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature. After washing in PBS three times for 10 min each, the cells were stained with 100 μm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole for 5 min. Cells were mounted with SlowFade Light Antifade reagent and covered with a coverslip. Samples were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope. Cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes at a density of 40,000 cells/dish under normal culture conditions. The cultures were lifted at 12, 24, 48, or 60 h after seeding and stained with trypan blue. The cell numbers were calculated using a hemocytometer. For viability assays, cells were plated at a density of 5000 cells/well in 96-well plates 24 h before the initiation of experiments. Cells were exposed to various treatments for 18-24 h. For Calcein AM assays, cells were rinsed with 1× PBS (pH 7.4) after treatment, and Calcein AM (25 μm) was added. After an incubation of 15 min at 37 °C, Calcein AM fluorescence was determined at an excitation of 485 nm and an emission of 538 nm using a Biotek FL600 microplate reader (Highland Park, VT). Percentage viability was calculated by normalization of all values to the control group (equal to 100%). The fluorescent potentiometric JC-1 dye exists as green monomer at low concentrations or at low Δψm. However, at higher concentrations or higher Δψm, JC-1 forms red fluorescent “J-aggregates” that exhibit a broad excitation spectrum and an emission at ∼590 nm. Thus, the emission of this cyanine dye can be used as a sensitive measure of Δψm. Cells were seeded on 25-mm coverslips and grown for 24 h. Resting Δψm was assessed by JC1 uptake. The coverslip was washed twice and mounted in a cell chamber (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY) in HEPES buffer (145 nm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES). Serial confocal images were taken every 5 min with a confocal scanning laser microscope (Zeiss LSM-410) with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 510 and 590 nm before and after JC1 (5 μg/ml) incubation, respectively. For detection of Δψm depolarization, the cells were incubated with JC1 (10 μg/ml) in media for 0.5 h, and then the coverslip was washed twice and mounted in a cell chamber. Serial confocal images were taken every 10 min with a confocal scanning laser microscope (×40 or ×100 objective) with excitation at 490 nm and emission at 510 and 590 nm. Collapse of Δψm was induced by adding hydrogen peroxide to a final concentration of 1 mm. Quantitative analysis of the dynamic change of the Δψm was performed by measurement of the red fluorescence intensity, using the Meta-Morph software (Carl Zeiss). Experiments were initiated by plating siERβ or vector-transfected HT-22 cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/well in 12-well plates. Seventy-two h later, cells were exposed to 250 or 500 μm H2O2 for 1 h, at which time cells were still alive and attached to the plate. Cellular ATP levels were quantified using a luciferin- and luciferase-based assay. Cells were rinsed with PBS and lysed with ATP-releasing buffer containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.8, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% Triton X-100; 10 μl of the lysate was taken for protein determination. Another 10 μl of the lysate was added to a Nunc 96-well plate. ATP concentrations in lysates were quantified using an ATP determination kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 96-well plates were read using a Biotek FL600 microplate reader. A standard curve was generated using solutions of known ATP concentrations. ATP levels were calculated as nm ATP/mg of protein and normalized to levels in untreated control cultures. Mitochondrial superoxide was determined by a fluorescent dye, MitoSOX™. Cells were seeded on 25-mm coverslips and grown for 24 h before initiation of the experiment. Cells were loaded with MitoSOX™ at a final concentration of 50 μm for 45 min. The coverslip was washed twice and mounted in a cell chamber in HEPES buffer. Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was induced by adding hydrogen peroxide. Serial confocal images were taken every 10 min with a confocal scanning laser microscope (Zeiss LSM-410) with excitation at 510 nm and emission at 580 nm. Quantitative analysis of the dynamic changes in mitochondrial superoxide was performed by measurement of the red fluorescence intensity, using the Meta-Morph software. Mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation from permanent ERβ knockdown HT-22 cells and vector control cells (15Yang S.H. Liu R. Perez E.J. Wen Y. Stevens Jr., S.M. Valencia T. Brun-Zinkernagel A.M. Prokai L. Will Y. Dykens J. Koulen P. Simpkins J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4130-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The absorption of cytochrome c at 550 nm changes with its oxidation state. Cytochrome c oxidase activity was determined by using a cytochrome c oxidase activity assay kit (CYTOC-OX1; Sigma). Briefly, 1 μg of isolated mitochondria preparations was resuspended in enzyme dilution buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, containing 250 mm sucrose) and added to 1× assay buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 120 mm KCl). Fifty μl of ferrocytochrome c substrate solution was added to initiate the reaction. The absorption changes at 550 nm were measured immediately using a spectrophotometer for 45 s. The activity of enzyme was calculated using the formula, units/mg protein = (ΔA/min × dilution factor × 1.1 × 1000)/(volume of enzyme × 21.84). An ERβ siRNA expression cassette under a PolIII promoter was cloned into a site flanked by the AAV-2 terminal repeats. Downstream of the siRNA expression cassette, a GFP expression cassette under the PolII promoter was inserted into that construct, resulting in plasmid that can be packaged in AAV-2. Packaging of the ERβ plasmid in a recombinant AAV serotype 2 was followed by the method described in detail by Klein et al. (37Klein R.L. Hamby M.E. Sonntag C.F. Millard W.J. King M.A. Meyer E.M. Methods. 2002; 28: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293 cells were transfected with the AAV-siERβ-GFP plasmid in an equimolar ratio with the plasmid pDG, which provides the AAV-2 coat protein genes, and adenovirus genes necessary for helper function in packaging (38Zolotukhin S. Potter M. Zolotukhin I. Sakai Y. Loiler S. Fraites Jr., T.J. Chiodo V.A. Phillipsberg T. Muzyczka N. Hauswirth W.W. Flotte T.R. Byrne B.J. Snyder R.O. Methods. 2002; 28: 158-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). At 48 h after transfection, cells were collected and pelleted. The pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl (pH 8) and freeze-thawed three times. The sample was then incubated with 125 units of benzonase (EMD Chemical, Inc., Gibbstown, NJ) per ml of supernatant for 30 min at room temperature. After benzonase treatment, the sample was centrifuged, and the supernatant was applied to 15, 25, 40, and 60% step gradients of iodixinol. The gradient was run at 65,000 rpm in a 70.1 Ti rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) for 1 h at room temperature. The AAV-2 was removed and added to a heparin affinity column (Sigma), and the eluent was washed and concentrated using Amicon Ultra 24 units. The packaging of the AAV-siERβ-GFP construct into virus was confirmed by electron microscopy. The titers of the viral stocks were ∼1012 for siRNA and 1013 for GFP. For AAV-2 infection, primary neurons were treated with 9 × 107 viral particles/50,000 neurons on day 7 in culture. Four days later, cultures were assessed for Δψm and immunocytochemistry. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Comparisons between two groups were performed using Student’s t test. Comparisons of multiple groups were analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s multiple comparison test. For all tests, p < 0.05 was considered significant. All statistical analyses were performed using Prism software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Knockdown of ERβ by RNA Interference in HT-22 Cells-In order to investigate the role of ERβ, we established two permanent siERβ clones together with a vector control clone. The clones were selected against and maintained in G418 medium. All the described experiments were conducted using these permanent cell lines within four passages. In the two permanent ERβ knockdown clones, more than 80% reductions in ERβ expression were achieved without significant changes of ERα expression, as indicated by Western blots (Fig. 1, A and B). To further confirm the immunoblotting results, we conducted immunocytochemistry on these siERβ and vector clones. In vector clones, ERβ was nearly exclusively localized in mitochondria, whereas the mitochondrial immunoreactivity for ERβ was substantially reduced in ERβ knockdown cells (Fig. 1C). siERβ1 was used to investigate the effects of ERβ knockdown in HT-22 cells, siERβ2 had similar effects in all experiments performed (data not shown). Effect of ERβ Knockdown on Cell Vulnerability-We studied the effects of ERβ knockdown on cell proliferation and cell vulnerability to various insults. There was no significant difference in the proliferation rates between the vector and siERβ clones (Fig. 2A) or between siERβ clones and wild type cells. However, ERβ knockdown significantly reduced cell death induced by iodoacetic acid treatment (Fig. 2B). Even more profound phenotype changes, characterized as an increase of resistance to glutamate and H2O2 toxicity, were demonstrated in ERβ knockdown cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Similar results were observed in repeated experiments in both permanent clones of the ERβ knockdown cell lines. Effect of ERβ Knockdown on Mitochondrial Function-We studied the effect of ERβ knockdown on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity. As is evident from Fig. 3A, a significant increase of cytochrome c oxidase activity was seen in the ERβ knockdown cell line, compared with the vector-transfected cell line. We further determined the effect of estrogen treatment on mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity in wild type HT-22 cells. HT-22 cells were treated with 17β-estradiol at the concentration of 100 nm or vehicle (DMSO) for 24 h, mitochondria were separated, and cytochrome c oxidase activity was determined. Compared with vehicle, a significant increase of cytochrome c oxidase activity was indicated in wild type HT-22 cells upon estrogen treatment (Fig. 3A). We studied the effect of ERβ on mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm), using a lipophilic cationic dye, JC-1. Initially, the permanent ERβ knockdown HT-22 or permanent vector control cells were incubated with JC-1 (5 μg/ml), and the uptake of JC-1 into the mitochondria was followed. As is evident from Fig. 3B, the JC-1 uptake rate was much slower in ERβ knockdown HT-22 cells than that in the vector clone, suggesting that these mitochondria in ERβ knockdown cells have a lower resting Δψm. We further assessed ATP production under oxidative stress in siERβ and vector clones. Vector clone exhibited a robust decline in ATP production in response to H2O2 treatment, whereas siERβ cells showed an attenuated decline in ATP levels in response to H2O2 insult (Fig. 3C). Mitochondria are well known as a predominant cellular source of ROS under both physiological and pathological conditions. We assessed the role of E"

Each has individually important biological functions on cell proliferation, apoptosis, development, and oncogenic processes, among others, as shown by numerous studies (3Black A.R. Black J.D.

Genome Biol. 2003; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). KLF5 is most commonly accepted to be an oncogenic factor. Its constitutive expression in fibroblasts results in increased cell colony formation, and oncogenic properties of H-Ras and Wnt-1 are mediated by KLF5 (5Sun R. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

In clinical tumors, the grade of malignancy has been shown to be associated with the expression level of KLF5. In prostate and breast cancers, however, KLF5 is thought to be a tumor suppressor; thus, this factor shows context-dependent properties (5Sun R. Chen X. Yang V.W. J. Biol.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6567-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We first identified this factor as a transcription factor that regulates expression of the embryonic form of smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SMemb/NMHC-B), which is selectively expressed in the proliferative dedifferentiated smooth muscle phenotype (12Watanabe N. Kurabayashi M. Shimomura Y. Kawai-Kowase K. Hoshino Y. Manabe I. Watanabe M. Aikawa M. Kuro-o M. Suzuki T. Yazaki Y. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 182-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Vascular remodeling including coronary artery disease is characterized by atherosclerotic plaque formation in which proliferating smooth muscle cells and neointimal cells encroach upon the vascular lumen (13Libby P. J. Intern. Med. 2000; 247: 349-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Further apoptosis of vascular cells affects remodeling by inducing regression of neointimal hyperplasia after vascular injury (e.g. restenosis) (14Bennett M.R. Heart (Lond.). 2002; 87: 480-487Google Scholar, 15Sata M. Tanaka K. Ishizaka N. Hirata Y. Nagai R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1548-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). KLF5 functions to mediate cardiovascular remodeling in response to external stress (e.g. angiotensin II) by regulating atherosclerosis, angiogenesis, and cardiac hypertrophy (16Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K. Aizawa K. Miyamoto S. Kawai-Kowase K. Moriyama N. Imai Y. Kawakami H. Nishimatsu H. Ishikawa T. Suzuki T. Morita H. Maemura K. Sata M. Hirata Y. Komukai M. Kagechika H. Kadowaki T. Kurabayashi M. Nagai R. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). It is expressed in proliferating smooth muscle cells of coronary artery lesions, namely proliferative stellate-shaped cells, and expression of this factor in lesions is clinically associated with restenosis and cardiac allograft vasculopathy (17Ogata T.

KLF5 expression is therefore associated with proliferating smooth muscle cells in the cardiovasculature (19Hoshino Y. Kurabayashi M. Kanda T. Hasegawa A. Sakamoto H. Okamoto E. Kowase K. Watanabe N.

However, it had yet to be shown how KLF5 directly induces cell proliferation and regulates apoptosis and how KLF5 mediates proliferative activity in vascular lesions and cells. In the present study, we have addressed the direct actions of KLF5 on cell growth and apoptosis in the vasculature and its constituting cells. Preparation of Plasmid Constructs and Recombinant Adenoviruses-pCAG-KLF5 and adenoviral KLF5 and Sp1 constructs were constructed as described previously (16Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K.

Rat Arterial Injury Model, Adenoviral Gene Delivery, and Immunohistochemistry-Male Sprague-Drawley rats (weighing 400-450 g) were anesthetized with chloral hydrate (Wako, 370 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally). Balloon denudation of the left common carotid artery was performed as described previously (8Miyamoto S. Suzuki T. Muto S. Aizawa K. Kimura A. Mizuno Y. Nagino T. Imai Y. Adachi N. Horikoshi M. Nagai R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8528-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Immediately after injury, 50 μl (2 × 109 plaque-forming unit/ml) of adenoviral construct (empty, KLF5 or Sp1) was infused and incubated for 30 min. 14 days after operation, rats were euthanized with a lethal dose of anesthetic. Serial cross sections (6 μm) were obtained from each carotid artery sample and stained with Elastica Van Gieson for morphometric analysis or prepared for immunohistochemistry with anti-KLF5 rat monoclonal antibody (KM1785, 1:4000) or anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) antibody (Dako, 1:1000). All experimental protocols complied with the guide-lines for animal experiments of the University of Tokyo. Cell Preparation and Culture-Rat aortic smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were isolated from the thoracic aorta as described previously and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium/F12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (21Geisterfer A.A. Peach M.J. Owens G.K. Circ. Res. 1988; 62: 749-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Cells between 7 and 12 passages were used in experiments. C2/2 rabbit vascular smooth muscle cells and 10T1/2 mouse myofibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μg of streptomycin/ml, and 100 units of penicillin G/ml. Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation Assay-2 × 105 rat VSMCs were at first infected with each adenoviral construct (100 multiplicities of infection) for 12 h, reseeded in duplicate in 6-well plates, and then starved from serum for 24 h. After serum stimulation, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and then counted using a cell counter (Beckman-Coulter). Experiments were done in triplicate. Cell Cycle Analysis-Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105/well. After serum starvation and transfection of adenoviral construct, cells were stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum. 24 h later, cells were trypsinized, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then fixed with 70% ethanol at -20 °C. The day before analysis, cells were resuspended in propidium iodide buffer (50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 0.1% Triton-X, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05 mg/ml RNase). Cells were transferred to a Falcon 33654 tube and then subjected to flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). Cell cycle distribution was calculated using the ModFit software (Verity Software House). Western Blot Analysis-Western blotting of proteins extracted from VSMCs or rat carotid artery specimens was performed using anti-KLF5 rat monoclonal antibody (KM1785, 1:4000), anti-cyclin D1 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, 1:500), anti-Sp1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500), anti-p21 mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200), anti-p27 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Transduction Laboratories, 1:2000), anti-cyclin E mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:500), anti-cyclin A rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, 1:500), and anti-cleaved caspase 3 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling, 1:500). Protein loading was controlled by probing the same membrane with anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mouse monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, 1:10000) or by anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (AbCam; 1:1000). Semiquantitative Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR-Total RNA was purified from VSMCs and subjected to RT-PCR as described previously (22Aizawa K. Suzuki T. Kada N. Ishihara A. Kawai-Kowase K.

The PCR primers were: rat KLF4, 5′-CTGGCGAGTCTGACATGGCTGTCAG-3′ and 5′-CGCCACTCTCCAGGTCTGTGCCAAC-3′; rat myocardin, 5′-CCAAACCAAAGGTGAAGAAGCTC-3′ and 5′-TGTCTTAACTCTGACACCTTGAG-3′; rat KLF6, 5′-TATCTTCAGGATGAGCCCTGCTAC-3′ and 5′-AGACTTCACCAATGGGATCAGAGG-3′; rat p21, 5′-AGTATGCCGTCGTCTGTTCG-3′ and 5′-GAGTGCAAGACAGCGACAAG-3′; and rat p27, 5′-CAGCTTGCCCGAGTTCTA-3′ and 5′-TGGGGAACCGTCTGAAAC-3′. Co-transfection Reporter Assay-Co-transfection reporter assay was performed as described previously using C2/2 cells (5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plate) transfected with 200 ng of pGL2-human cyclin D1 promoter deletion constructs and 200 ng of pCAG-KLF5 (20Nagata D. Suzuki E. Nishimatsu H. Satonaka H. Goto A. Omata M. Hirata Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 662-669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Assays were done in duplicate, and expression levels of KLF5 were confirmed by immunoblotting with anti-KLF5 antibody. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)-EMSAs were performed using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled double-stranded, synthetic oligonucleotides. Overlapping Sp1-binding sites located upstream (Sp1-1 or Sp1-2) were analyzed. Nucleotides sequences of the sense strand were as follows: Sp1-1wt2wt, 5′-GGCGCCCGCGCCCCCCTCCCCCTGC-3′; Sp1-1mut2mut, 5′-GGCGCaatttCCCCCTaattaTGC-3′; Sp1-1mut2wt, 5′-GGCGCaatttCCCCCTCCCCCTGC-3′; Sp1-1wt2mut, 5′-GGCGCCCGCGCCCCCTaattaGC-3′. The underlined letters depict nucleotide substitutions to induce mutations. Reaction mixtures contained 50 ng of recombinant KLF5-DNA-binding domain protein and 50 ng of probe. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays-Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed as described previously with rat VSMCs cultured in 10-cm dishes stimulated with 10% fetal calf serum or kept deprived from serum after starvation for 48 h (23Kang J.H. Kim M.J. Ko S.H. Jeong I.K. Koh K.H. Rhie D.J. Yoon S.H. Hahn S.J. Kim M.S. Jo Y.H. Diabetologia. 2006; 49: 969-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Chromatin samples were immunoprecipitated with anti-KLF5 rabbit polyclonal antibody (raised against a synthetic peptide) or preimmune serum as control. PCR was performed with the following primers: rat cyclin D1 promoter, 5′-CGGCGATTTGCATATCTACGAAGG-3′ and 5′-AAGCCGGGCAGAGAAAAAGGAG-3′. Construction of Small Hairpin Interfering RNA for KLF5-We searched target sequences for KLF5 RNA interference by an online siRNA sequence selector (Clontech) and used the following sequence, 5′-GGTCCAGACAAGATGTGAA-3′. Designed oligonucleotides were then annealed and ligated into pSIREN, a human pU6 promoter plasmid (Clontech). The ligated construct was verified for KLF5 knockdown and amplified for transfection. Terminal dUTP Nick-end Labeling (TUNEL) Staining and Apoptotic Assays-5 × 104 rat VSMCs were transfected with adenoviral constructs and then treated with 2 μmol/liter anisomysin (Sigma). Apoptotic cells were detected using the in situ cell death detection kit (Takara) and counterstained with propidium iodide. Balloon injured rat carotid arteries were harvested 48 h after balloon injury and stained for apoptotic nuclei using the in situ cell death detection kit (Takara). Specimens were treated with TUNEL reaction mixture and then diaminobenzidine-stained. Statistical Analysis-Data are shown as mean ± S.D. Differences between two groups were analyzed using the Student’s t test. The threshold of significance was taken as p < 0.05. KLF5 Promotes Neointimal Formation and Cell Proliferation-KLF5 expression is induced in the aortic wall by vascular injury in rats and in rabbits and has been suggested to contribute to the remodeling process. However, how it promotes vascular remodeling has not been clarified. We thus overexpressed KLF5 in rats subjected to carotid balloon injury by adenoviral transfer to address the direct effects of KLF5 on vascular remodeling. Under conditions in which overexpression of KLF5 in rat carotid arteries was confirmed by immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting (Fig. 1, A and B), histological examination showed that neointimal formation was markedly increased by adenoviral transfer of KLF5 at 2 weeks after balloon injury (Fig. 1C). Morphometric analysis (n = 10 each) confirmed significantly increased intima/media ratio (I/M) in the KLF5 group (I/M: 1.40 ± 0.23) as compared with Sp1 or empty groups. Sp1, a similar zinc finger transcription factor, was used as control. There was no significant difference in neointimal formation between the empty group (I/M: 0.66 ± 0.26) or the Sp1 group (I/M: 0.70 ± 0.23). PCNA immunostaining showed a significantly higher positive rate in the intimal and medial layers of the KLF5 group (52 ± 12%) as compared with those in the empty group (16 ± 3.7%) or in the Sp1 group (24 ± 3.1%) (Fig. 1D). KLF5 Stimulates SMC Proliferation and Accelerates Cell Cycle Progression-Based on the stimulatory effect of KLF5 on neointimal formation in the animal model, we next examined the effects of KLF5 overexpression on cell proliferation using primary cultured rat VSMCs. KLF5 induction resulted in increased cell proliferation after serum stimulation as compared with those of Sp1 or empty groups (Fig. 2A). Cell cycle analysis showed markedly increased S-phase bulging after KLF5 transfection both in myofibroblasts and in VSMCs, which are the two major cellular components of vascular remodeling (Fig. 2B) (24Hinz B. Phan S.H. Thannickal V.J. Galli A. Bochaton-Piallat M.L. Gabbiani G. Am. J. Pathol. 2007; 170: 1807-1816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). To further investigate the effects of KLF5 on cell cycle progression, expression levels of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs), and other cellular factors were analyzed by Western blot (Fig. 2C) and RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2D). Although serum starvation alone resulted in up-regulation of expression levels of cyclin D1 in the Sp1 group, expression levels were markedly augmented in the KLF5 group at 24 h after serum stimulation. The expression level of cyclin E was higher in the Sp1 group, whereas neither cyclin A nor p27 showed significant difference in expression levels after serum stimulation. In contrast, the expression level of p21 in the KLF5 group was higher than that of the empty group, which was much lower as compared with that induced in the Sp1 group. These different effects between KLF5 and Sp1 on the cyclins and CKIs may explain the different effects among these factors found in cell growth and cell cycle distribution studies. Under the same conditions, we also investigated the transcription levels of other KLFs, namely KLF4, which has also been implicated to be involved in regulating SMC growth, and myocardin, as myocardin has been shown to be a growth inhibitor of SMCs (25Long X. Bell R.D. Gerthoffer W.T. Zlokovic B.V. Miano J.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2008; 28: 1505-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). KLF5 overexpression did not influence the expression levels of KLF4; however, it suppressed those of myocardin. KLF5 Is Directly Recruited to the Cyclin D1 Promoter in VSMCs-Previous studies have shown KLF5 to regulate cyclin D1 in fibroblasts or cancer cell lines (6Nandan M.O. Yoon H.S. Zhao W. Ouko L.A. Chanchevalap S. Yang V.W. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3404-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Chen C. Benjamin M.S. Sun X. Otto K.B. Guo P. Dong X.Y. Bao Y. Zhou Z. Cheng X. Simons J.W. Dong J.T. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1346-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To address the transactivation activity of KLF5 on cyclin D1 in cardiovascular cells, we transfected deletion mutants of the human cyclin D1 promoter reporter into C2/2 cells aiming to map cis-elements that are required for transcriptional activity of the cyclin D1 promoter. Schematic illustrations of the cyclin D1 promoter-reporter deletion constructs are shown (Fig. 3, A, B, and D). Deletion of the putative AP1-binding sites, two NFκB-binding sites, and STAT-binding sites did not affect luciferase reporter activity. pGL2/-161/Sp1, which encodes multiple Sp1-binding sites, an activating transcription factor/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding site, and an NFκB-binding site, had almost the same effect on promoter activity as pGL2/-1719, which encoded the full-length cyclin D1 promoter. Interestingly, when the Sp1-binding sites were deleted (pGL2/-95/ΔSp1), promoter activity decreased to one-half of that of the full-length cyclin D1 promoter. Further deletion of the putative activating transcription factor/cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding site and the NFκB-binding site (pGL2/-23/ΔNFκB3) resulted in reduction of promoter activity almost to the same level as the pGL2-basic vector (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that cis-regulatory elements involved in KLF5-induced transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 lie between -161 bp and -95 bp of the Sp1-binding sites, which is reasonable given that KLF5 and all other Sp/KLF members commonly bind GC-rich sites/Sp1-binding sites (1Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). To further examine the functions of the Sp1-binding sites, analysis using point mutations to each of the sites was done. Insertion of a mutation to the second Sp1-binding site (Sp1-2) resulted in significant reduction in reporter activity as compared with the wild-type construct. We also saw a marginal elevation in reporter activity with mutation of the first Sp1-binding site (Sp1-1). Effects were not seen with mutations in the two downstream Sp1-binding sites (Fig. 3E). EMSA experiments confirmed that KLF5 preferentially binds the Sp1-binding site, Sp1-2. Under conditions in which KLF5 bound a DNA probe containing the first two Sp1-binding sites (Fig. 3F, lane 2) in a sequence-specific manner, as shown by the fact that wild-type competitor could compete out this band (lane 3) but a competitor containing mutant sequences for both Sp1-1 and Sp1-2 could not (lane 4), specific mutations against Sp1-1 and Sp1-2 were tested. These results showed that a mutant probe for Sp1-2 (lane 6) could not compete as well as a mutant for Sp1-1 (lane 5), thus suggesting that KLF5 shows preferential binding to Sp1-2. Collectively, the reporter assay and EMSA show that the actions of KLF5 on the cyclin D1 promoter are mediated by the Sp1-2 site. To further investigate the recruitment of KLF5 to the rat cyclin D1 promoter in vivo, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done. PCR analysis was performed to amplify the region of the rat cyclin D1 promoter from -213 bp to -69 bp that contains the Sp1-binding motifs. In vivo binding of KLF5 to the cyclin D1 promoter was clearly induced in response to serum stimulation (Fig. 3G), which suggested that this interaction was induced by external growth stimulation. This finding is consistent with past studies that have shown that induction of KLF5 activates the PDGF-A chain promoter, which in turn promotes proliferative change through phenotypic modulation mediated by such para/autocrines on VSMCs (16Shindo T.

KLF5 Knockdown Attenuates Cell Proliferation and Cell Cycle Progression-To further investigate the role of KLF5 on cell proliferation in vascular cells, knockdown of KLF5 was carried out using plasmid-based siRNAs. Under conditions of specific knockdown of KLF5 in rat VSMCs, marked suppression of cyclin D1 expression was seen, whereas cyclin A expression was not affected (Fig. 4A). On analysis of cell growth, KLF5 knockdown resulted in significant suppression of VSMC proliferation after serum stimulation (Fig. 4B). To better characterize the inhibitory effect of KLF5 knockdown on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution was analyzed (Fig. 4C). 38% of cells were in the S-phase in the empty group, 30% were in the si-luciferase (siLuc) group, and 18% were in the siKLF5 group. Therefore, S-phase transition was markedly decreased by RNA interference against KLF5. KLF5 Expression Attenuates VSMC Apoptosis-Cell proliferation is inextricably linked to apoptosis. To investigate the contribution of apoptotic properties of KLF5 on cell proliferation, we examined the effects on caspase-3 cleavage by Western blot using rat VSMCs before and after serum stimulation. Cleavage of caspase-3 was seen in the empty and Sp1 groups under serum deprivation and in the Sp1 group after stimulation. In contrast, cleavage was not seen either under serum deprivation or after stimulation in the KLF5 group (Fig. 5A). Even under cytotoxic conditions using anisomycin, KLF5 exhibited protective effects against apoptosis (Fig. 5B). Concurrently, we analyzed apoptosis in the injured arteries using TUNEL staining. At 2 weeks after injury, there were no apoptotic cells seen in the neointimal and medial layers in either group (Fig. 5C). However, arteries administered with KLF5 showed significantly decreased apoptotic cells in the medial layer 48 h after injury (Fig. 5D). This indicates that the anti-apoptotic effect by KLF5 was exerted in the early phase after vascular injury. Direct Promotion of VSMC Proliferation by KLF5 via Transactivation of Cyclin D1 Transcription-In the present study, KLF5 overexpression resulted in promotion of cell proliferation, and gene silencing of KLF5 with RNA interference showed marked suppression of cyclin D1 expression and decreased cell growth. These results suggest that KLF5 acts to induce cell proliferation in cardiovascular cells, VSMCs, and myofibroblasts. As cell growth is coupled with cell cycle progression, we focused on understanding the mechanisms whereby KLF5 regulates cyclin D1, a key initiator of the cell cycle engine. To date, a direct relationship between KLF5 and cyclin D1 had not yet been shown. Our studies for the first time showed direct activation of cyclin D1 by KLF5 with reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation and also that a putative binding motif lies around the Sp1-binding sites in the cyclin D1 promoter region. Thus, mechanistically, induction of KLF5 leads to direct transactivation of cyclin D1 expression, which subsequently stimulates cell proliferation. Transcriptional mechanisms at the chromatin level are another area of interest. Past studies suggest that the coactivator/acetylase p300 is involved in transcriptional activation by KLF5 (8Miyamoto S. Suzuki T. Muto S. Aizawa K. Kimura A. Mizuno Y. Nagino T. Imai Y. Adachi N. Horikoshi M. Nagai R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8528-8541Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 26Munemasa Y. Suzuki T. Aizawa K. Miyamoto S. Imai Y. Matsumura T. Horikoshi M. Nagai R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1171-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For regulation of transcription of the cyclin D1 promoter, it appeared that p300 at least in part is one of the chromatin cofactors that are involved. RNA interference studies showed that knockdown of p300 attenuated acetylated histone levels (as a measure of transcriptional activation), and conversely, that knockdown of KLF5 also attenuated acetylated histone levels as well as promoter recruitment of p300 to a promoter region that mediates KLF5 actions, thus suggesting cooperative actions of KLF5 and p300 in transcriptional activation of this gene promoter. 5Munemasa et al., unpublished observations. Significance of KLF5 in Induction of CDKs and CKIs-Cell proliferation is coupled with cell cycle progression and subsequent mitosis (27Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1992) Google Scholar). Further, cell cycle progression is mediated by cyclins (e.g. cyclin D1, cyclin E, and cyclin A) (28Sherr C.J. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1995; 107: 181-186PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibited by CKIs (e.g. p21 and p27) (29Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). Initiation of S-phase transition is in particular promoted by cyclin D1 (30Sherr C.J. Cell Cycle. 2002; 1: 36-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In cardiovascular cells, induced and forced-expressed KLF5 showed direct recruitment onto the cyclin D1 promoter coupled with markedly increased transactivation of cyclin D1 in contrast to relatively low transactivation of p21, which coordinately resulted in marked cell proliferation. In general, p21 induction suppresses CDK/cyclin complex kinase activity and subsequently induces cell growth arrest (31Andres V. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 63: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, it has also been reported that proper cell cycle progression requires coordinated assembly of p21 and CDK/cyclin complex formation in addition to repression of p21, which results in decreased cell growth (29Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar, 32Sinibaldi D. Wharton W. Turkson J. Bowman T. Pledger W.J. Jove R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10285-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, in our experiment, overexpression of Sp1 in VSMCs resulted in lower induction of cyclin D1 and much higher induction of p21, which subsequently resulted in negative regulation of cardiovascular cell proliferation. KLF6 up-regulation by Sp1 may have further reinforced the expression of p21 in an additive manner (35Benzeno S. Narla G. Allina J. Cheng G.Z. Reeves H.L. Banck M.S. Odin J.A. Diehl J.A. Germain D. Friedman S.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 3885-3891Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). This result was consistent with observations on caspase-3 cleavage. KLF5 overexpression did not, however, reduce the expression levels of p27 at the mRNA or protein levels. This may be due at least in part to context-dependent regulation of p27 expression in VSMCs. Although both PDGF-BB and angiotensin II are mitogenic stimuli, PDGF-BB attenuates p27 expression, but angiotensin II has no effect on expression, thus suggesting the possibility of differential regulation of p27 under cell growth conditions (36Servant M.J. Coulombe P. Turgeon B. Meloche S. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 543-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The different results on cell growth between Sp/KLF families may be due to the different proportion of transactivation effects on CDKs and CKIs. It was also surprising that overexpression of these factors showed opposite effects, one showing proliferative effects, whereas the other showed apoptotic effects, although these two transcription factors belong to the same Sp/KLF family that has similar DNA binding activities (1Suske G. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 238: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). Contribution of KLF5 to Vascular Remodeling, Inhibition of Apoptosis, and Direct Promotion of VSMC Proliferation-The role of KLF5 in vascular pathology was first recognized upon its identification as a regulatory factor of phenotypic modulation that directly controls expression of SMC marker genes and paracrine factors such as PDGF-A chain and transforming growth factor-β in vitro and in vivo (16Shindo T. Manabe I. Fukushima Y. Tobe K. Aizawa K. Miyamoto S. Kawai-Kowase K. Moriyama N. Imai Y. Kawakami H. Nishimatsu H. Ishikawa T. Suzuki T. Morita H. Maemura K. Sata M. Hirata Y. Komukai M. Kagechika H.

KLF5 is presently understood to exhibit growth promoting effects in vascular remodeling through these para/autocrines (37Fujiu K. Manabe I. Ishihara A. Oishi Y. Iwata H. Nishimura G. Shindo T. Maemura K. Kagechika H. Shudo K. Nagai R. Circ. Res. 2005; 97: 1132-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In general, chronological progression of vascular remodeling in response to external injury consists of several phases of cellular activities as exemplified by apoptosis in initial phases and proliferation in later phases. Concerning early apoptotic effects, apoptotic SMC death is seen at early time points after injury, and higher apoptotic rates correlate with decreased neointimal formation or restenosis after angioplasty (38Perlman H. Maillard L. Krasinski K. Walsh K. Circulation. 1997; 95: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 39Malik N. Francis S.E. Holt C.M. Gunn J. Thomas G.L. Shepherd L. Chamberlain J.

Gerontol. 2001; 36: 969-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Significantly decreased apoptosis, as seen in the medial layer of the KLF5 group, recognized as early as 48 h after injury, may have led to increased neointimal formation. In addition to the anti-apoptotic property shown in the present in vitro experiments, KLF5 heterozygous knock-out mice in fact show increased apoptosis after vascular wire injury, thus confirming a regulatory role of KLF5 in vascular pathological apoptosis (41Suzuki T. Nishi T. Nagino T. Sasaki K. Aizawa K. Kada N. Sawaki D. Munemasa Y. Matsumura T. Muto S. Sata M. Miyagawa K. Horikoshi M. Nagai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Concerning late proliferative effects, overexpression of KLF5 significantly increased neointimal formation through direct stimulatory effects on vascular remodeling. KLF5 also showed proliferative effects on SMCs both in vitro and in vivo in the present study (SMC proliferation assay, PCNA labeling, etc). TUNEL staining, however, did not show any apoptotic cells at 14 days after injury in any group, indicating that the stimulatory effect on vascular remodeling in the late phase was due mainly to activation of cell growth. Taken together, KLF5 regulates both apoptosis in the early phase and proliferation in the late phase, thus indicating that this factor acts as a bimodal and likely central regulator of proliferative cardiovascular pathologies.

Despite the importance of this interaction, little is known regarding the underlying regulatory mechanisms. In this study, the binding interface between the pro- and mature domains of the inhibin α-subunit was characterized using in vitro mutagenesis. Three hydrophobic residues near the N terminus of the prodomain (Leu30, Phe37, Leu41) were identified that, when mutated to alanine, disrupted heterodimer assembly and secretion. It is postulated that these residues mediate dimerization by interacting non-covalently with hydrophobic residues (Phe271, Ile280, Pro283, Leu338, and Val340) on the outer convex surface of the mature α-subunit. Homology modeling indicated that these mature residues are located at the interface between two β-sheets of the α-subunit and that their side chains form a hydrophobic packing core. Mutation of these residues likely disturbs the conformation of this region, thereby disrupting non-covalent interactions with the prodomain. A similar hydrophobic interface was identified spanning the pro- and mature domains of the inhibin βA-subunit. Mutation of key residues, including Ile62, Leu66, Phe329, and Pro341, across this interface was disruptive for the production of both inhibin A and activin A.

Ooi G.T. Harrison C. Robertson D.M. Findlay J.K. J. Endocrinol. 2006; 188: 451-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It is recognized that inhibins regulate these processes by inhibiting the stimulatory actions of the structurally related proteins, activins (8Vale W. Rivier J. Vaughan J. McClintock R. Corrigan A. Woo W. Karr D. Spiess J. Nature. 1986; 321: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar). Inhibins are heterodimers of an 18-kDa α-subunit disulfide linked to one of two 13-kDa β-subunits (βA and βB), resulting in inhibin A or inhibin B, respectively. Activins are composed of two β-subunits: βA-βA (activin A), βA-βB (activin AB), and βB-βB (activin B). Inhibin antagonism of activin-related ligands is dependent upon interactions with betaglycan, a cell surface proteoglycan that also acts as a TGFβ2 co-receptor (9Lewis K.A. Gray P.C. Blount A.L. MacConell L.A. Wiater E. Bilezikjian L.M. Vale W. Nature. 2000; 404: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Betaglycan binds inhibin A directly and promotes the formation of a stable high affinity complex involving activin type II receptors (10Wiater E. Vale W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7934-7941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Sequestration of type II receptors in this way prevents their interactions with signaling ligands such as activin A or activin B.Analogous to other members of the TGFβ superfamily, inhibin subunits are synthesized as large precursor molecules. The inhibin α-subunit precursor is divided into three regions by two polyarginine cleavage sites (see Fig. 1A): the 43-amino acid proregion; the 171-amino acid αN region; and the 134-amino acid C-terminal (αC) mature region (11Mason A.J. Farnworth P.G. Sullivan J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The βA-subunit precursor consists of a 290-amino acid prodomain, separated by a polyarginine cleavage sequence from a 116-amino acid C-terminal mature domain (11Mason A.J. Farnworth P.G. Sullivan J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1055-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). During the secretory process, the α- and βA-subunit mature domains fold into a disulfide-linked dimer. The large inhibin precursors are proteolytically cleaved by furin-like proprotein convertases at an RXRR consensus sequence, which separates the prodomains from the mature domains, and the mature inhibin dimers are secreted.It has been postulated that the prodomains of the α- and βA-subunits are necessary for the correct folding, disulfide bond formation, export, and biological activity of inhibin A (12Gray A.M. Mason A.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1328-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 13Russell D.L. Doughton B.W. Tsonis C.G. Findlay J.K. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1994; 100: 115-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar regulatory functions have been ascribed to the prodomains of other TGFβ ligands. For example, the prodomain of TGFβ1 (termed latency-associated protein; LAP) represents a functional binding partner for the mature protein (14Gentry L.E. Webb N.R. Lim G.J. Brunner A.M.

In the current study, the binding interface between the pro- and mature domains of the inhibin α-subunit was characterized. Site-directed mutagenesis identified key hydrophobic residues at this interface, which are conserved across the TGFβ superfamily. Based on these investigations, we predict that a common biosynthetic pathway governs the assembly and secretion of TGFβ ligands.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProduction of Inhibin Mutants-Mutations in the pro- and mature regions of the inhibin α- and βA-subunits were introduced using the QuikChange Lightning site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). pCDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vectors containing either the full-length wild type inhibin α-or βA-subunits served as the templates in these reactions. The mature region of the α-subunit also contained a mutation (N302Q) to ensure that only a 31-kDa inhibin A was produced (30Makanji Y. Harrison C.A. Stanton P.G. Krishna R. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2007; 148: 2309-2316Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For each construct, the mutated region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild type and mutant inhibin A and activin A proteins were produced by transient transfection in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). Briefly, CHO cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/well in a 6-well plate. Wild type or mutant α-subunit DNA (1.6 μg) was combined with βA-subunit DNA (3.3 μg), and Lipofectamine was added according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After a 20-min incubation, DNA/Lipofectamine complexes were added directly to the plated cells and incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM medium (Invitrogen) for a further 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2.The transfected CHO culture medium and cell lysate for each of the inhibin A and activin A mutants were assessed by Western blotting. At 48 h after transfection, the culture medium was removed and concentrated 50-fold using Nanosep microconcentration devices with a 10-K cut-off (Pall Life Sciences, East Hills, NY). The cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). Non-reduced samples were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting. After electrophoresis, samples were transferred onto ECL Hybond membranes (GE Healthcare, Giles, Buckinghamshire, UK). Inhibin α- and βA-subunits were detected using the R1 and E4 antibodies, respectively.Inhibin A ELISA-An inhibin A ELISA (Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, Texas) was used as described (31Robertson D.M. Stephenson T. Pruysers E. Burger H.G. McCloud P. Tsigos A. Groome N. Mamers P. McNeilage J. Jobling T. Healy D. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 191: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), employing kit reagents provided by Oxford Bio-Innovation Ltd. (Upper Heyford, UK). The ELISA utilized the βA-subunit antibody (E4) as capture antibody and α subunit antibody (R1) as label. The sensitivity of the assay was 2 pg/ml.Activin A Immunofluorometric Assay-To measure the concentration of wild type and mutant activin A in the conditioned medium of CHO cells, an activin immunofluorometric assay was employed (32Harrison C.A. Chan K.L. Robertson D.M. Endocrinology. 2006; 147: 2744-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The working range of the assay was 0.03–3 ng/well, and the assay sensitivity was 0.03 ng/well. Activin A assays were measured from duplicate transfections in CHO cells.Production of the βA-Propeptide-Wild type and mutant (I62A or I62A/L66A) βA-propeptides were generated by PCR (antisense primer 5′-CTAGGAATTCCTATTTGTCGTCGTCGTCTTTGTAGTCGGCTCTCTCCCCTCCACTGGGTG-3′) and cloned into the NotI and XbaI sites of a pCDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen). The propeptides were truncated 5′ of the cleavage sites upstream of the mature domain so that only the prodomains were expressed. The primers incorporated a 3′-FLAG tag. The wild type and mutant βA-propeptides were produced by transient transfection in 293T cells (human renal epithelial cells) using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 293T cells were plated at 1.2 × 107 cells/plate in 15-cm plates. Wild type or mutant βA-propeptide DNA (75 μg) were combined with Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After a 20-min incubation, DNA/Lipofectamine complexes were added directly to the plates, which were incubated in serum-free Opti-MEM medium for a further 48 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2. At 48 h after transfection, the 293T conditioned medium was collected and concentrated 30-fold using Amicon Ultra-15 concentration devices with a 10-kDa regenerated cellulose membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Concentrated protein was diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (Complete protease inhibitor mixture tablets, Roche Applied Science, Basel, Switzerland).Analysis of the Interaction between the βA-Propeptide and Mature Inhibin A/Activin A-Conditioned medium from transfected CHO cells expressing wild type and mutant βA-propeptide with a C-terminal FLAG tag was concentrated 50-fold using Nanosep microconcentration devices with a 10-K cut-off (Pall Life Sciences) and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. Non-reduced samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto ECL Hybond membranes (GE Healthcare). Membranes were blocked in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) with 5% milk. The blocking solution was removed by multiple washes in TBS/bovine serum albumin (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20), and the membranes were probed with either 125I-inhibin A or 125I-activin A (400,000 cpm/ml) in TBS/bovine serum albumin. After incubation, the tracer was removed by multiple washes with TBS, and the membranes were exposed to film for up to 4 days at -80 °C and developed.Immunoprecipitation-The ability of the βA-propeptide and activin type II receptors (ActRIIA and ActRIIB) to compete for binding to mature activin A was assessed by immunoprecipitation. Increasing concentrations of ActRIIA and ActRIIB extracellular domains (25 ng–4 μg; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) were added to samples containing wild type βA-propeptide (400 ng) and activin A (12.5 ng). Samples were immunoprecipitated using a FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich) directed against the βA-propeptide. Protein complexes were eluted from the resin using reducing sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, samples were transferred onto an ECL Hybond membrane. The activin βA-subunit was detected using the E4 antibody, and βA-propeptides were identified using the FLAG M2 antibody.In Vitro Bioassay-Wild type and mutant (I62A/L66A) βA-propeptides were assessed for their ability to suppress activin A bioactivity in a mouse adrenocortical cell line (7Farnworth P.G. Wang Y. Leembruggen P. Ooi G.T. Harrison C. Robertson D.M. Findlay J.K. J. Endocrinol. 2006; 188: 451-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, adrenocortical cells were plated in 48-well plates at 114,000 cells/well. After a 24-h incubation, cells were transfected with an activin responsive luciferase reporter construct (pGRAS) using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). The cells were washed 24 h after transfection with complete medium and treated with 400 pm activin A and increasing doses of either wild type or mutant βA-propeptides (0.5–30 nm) or inhibin A (0.1–3 nm). Activin-induced luciferase activity was then determined.Statistics-Significance (p < 0.05) was determined using one-way t tests for independent groups. In Figs. 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7, all error bars shown represent standard deviation.FIGURE 3Effects of βA prodomain (pro-βA) mutations on inhibin/activin biosynthesis. A, alanine substitutions were made in the hydrophobic residues of the inhibin βA prodomain using in vitro mutagenesis. To determine the effects of these amino acid substitutions on inhibin A and activin A production, culture medium from CHO cells transfected with either wild type (lane 1) or mutant βA-subunit (lanes 2–4), in combination with the α-subunit, were analyzed by Western blot. Blots were probed with the E4 mAb, specific for the inhibin/activin mature βA domain (B) and the R1 mAb specific for the inhibin αC (mature) domain (C).

Wild type and mutant βA-propeptide (with C-terminal FLAG tag) were loaded at equivalent concentrations (as determined by Western blotting with the FLAG M2 mAb, top panel) onto SDS-PAGE and transferred to an ECL Hybond membrane. Membranes were probed with either 125I-activin A (middle panel) or 125I-inhibin A (bottom panel). B and C, the ability of the activin type II receptors (ActRIIA and ActRIIB) to compete with the βA-propeptide (proβA) for binding to mature activin A was assessed by immunoprecipitation. Increasing concentrations of ActRIIA (B) and ActRIIB (C) extracellular domains (ECD) (25 ng–4 μg; R&D Systems) were added to samples containing wild type βA-propeptide (400 ng) and activin A (12.5 ng). Samples were immunoprecipitated (IP) using FLAG M2 affinity resin and detected by immunoblot (IB) using the activin βA subunit mAb (E4). To ensure that equal amounts of activin and βA-propeptides were present in each of the samples, immunoblots using the FLAG M2 and E4 antibodies were also performed prior to immunoprecipitation.

Based on previous studies (15Sha X. Yang L. Gentry L.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 827-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 17Young G.D. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol.

Commun. 2004; 315: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the proregion (Cys19–Arg61) was identified as the region most likely to be involved in non-covalent interactions with the mature α-subunit. Hydrophobic residues through this region were substituted with alanine using in vitro mutagenesis. In all, a set of 10 variants mutated at 12 different positions was generated (Fig. 1A).Wild type and mutant proteins were expressed in CHO cells and the conditioned medium and cell lysate were collected. Western blot analysis indicated that conditioned medium from cells transfected with wild type α- and βA-subunits contained both mature (31-kDa) and precursor (65- and 95-kDa) inhibin forms, together with substantial amounts of free α-subunit (50 kDa) (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Mutation of the majority of hydrophobic residues through the proregion had little effect on the amount or the composition of the inhibin forms produced by CHO cells (Fig. 1, B and D). However, three residues (Leu30, Phe37, Leu41) were identified that, when mutated to alanine, resulted in a significant reduction (>80%) in the amount of inhibin A produced and secreted (Fig. 1, B and D). An analysis of the cell lysates from the transfected CHO cells indicated that the decrease in inhibin A production was not due to a loss of α-subunit expression as it was present at similar levels for all mutants tested (Fig. 1C). Rather, the identified point mutations (L30A, F37A, and L41A) appeared to disrupt the dimerization of the α- and βA-subunits, as evidenced by the decrease in dimeric inhibin precursor (Fig. 1C, compare lane 1 with lanes 5, 8, and 10). Together, these results suggest that Leu30, Phe37, and Leu41 are necessary to maintain the inhibin α-subunit in a conformation competent for dimerization with the βA-subunit.Conservation of the Hydrophobic Motif in the Prodomains of TGFβ Ligands-Sequence alignment (as determined using ClustalW) of the 33 human TGFβ family members indicated that Phe37 and Leu41 of the inhibin α-subunit form part of a hydrophobic motif (Hyd-Hyd-X-X-Hyd-X-Hyd), which is present in most family members (Fig. 2). This conservation of hydrophobicity suggests that a common mechanism governing dimer assembly may exist across the TGFβ superfamily.FIGURE 2Sequence alignment of prodomains for human TGFβ ligands. The inhibin α-subunit (Inh α) prodomain was aligned with the prodomains of human TGFβ ligands using ClustalW. The residues are numbered according to the first residue of the signal peptide. The three residues determined in this study to be essential for inhibin dimer formation and secretion (Leu30, Phe37, and Leu41) are highlighted. The identified residues lie within a conserved hydrophobic motif (bottom of alignment). Act, activin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test this, the corresponding hydrophobic residues in the activin βA-subunit (common to both activin A and inhibin A) were substituted for alanine (Fig. 3). βA-subunit point mutations, I62A and L66A, were disruptive for activin A expression. Western blot analysis using an antibody directed against the βA-subunit (Fig. 3B), and an activin A ELISA (Fig. 3E) showed the profound effects these mutations had on activin A production and secretion. Interestingly, inhibin A levels (Fig. 3, C and F), although decreased, were not suppressed to the same extent as activin A levels. As the precursor βA-subunit was present in cell lysates at comparable levels for each of the variants (Fig. 3D), decreased activin and inhibin expression likely occurred because of a defect in folding and/or dimerization. Interestingly, mutation of Val55 of the βA-subunit (corresponding to Leu30 of the α-subunit) had no effect on inhibin A or activin A expression. This residue is upstream of the hydrophobic motif and is less well conserved across the TGFβ family.The βA-Subunit Prodomain Interacts Directly with A"
https://openalex.org/W2112572048,"RNA silencing is a conserved pathway that functions as an antiviral mechanism. The majority of viruses encode silencing suppressors that interfere with siRNA- and miRNA-guided silencing pathways. The insect flock house virus B2 protein (FHVB2) functions as an RNAi silencing suppressor that inhibits siRNA biogenesis. Here, we describe the generation of a GFP silent sensor line (Sf21) and a GFP sensor line expressing FHVB2 to study RNAi suppression mechanisms. Overexpression of FHVB2 resulted in suppression of GFP-RNAi and resumption of GFP expression. Protein fractionation studies with FHVB2-transfected cells showed that FHVB2 associates with a high-molecular-weight complex of Dicer and dsRNA/siRNAs. Yeast two-hybrid and pulldown assays revealed an interaction between FHVB2 and Drosophila Dicer proteins that appeared to involve PAZ domains. To map the FHVB2 domains interacting with Dicer, we used a 17-residue C-terminal deletion mutant. RNAi suppression was reversed in cells transfected with the FHVB2 mutant as revealed by loss of GFP. Additional yeast two-hybrid and in vitro pulldown assays confirmed that the C-terminal region of FHVB2 was involved in the interaction with the PAZ domains of Dicers. These results thus reveal a novel interaction between FHVB2 and Dicer that leads to suppression of siRNA biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1973648996,"Ca(2+) influx via GluR2-lacking Ca(2+)-permeable AMPA glutamate receptors (CP-AMPARs) can trigger changes in synaptic efficacy in both interneurons and principle neurons, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We took advantage of genetically altered mice with no or reduced GluR2, thus allowing the expression of synaptic CP-AMPARs, to investigate the molecular signaling process during CP-AMPAR-induced synaptic plasticity at CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. Utilizing electrophysiological techniques, we demonstrated that these receptors were capable of inducing numerous forms of long-term potentiation (referred to as CP-AMPAR dependent LTP) through a number of different induction protocols, including high-frequency stimulation (HFS) and theta-burst stimulation (TBS). This included a previously undemonstrated form of protein-synthesis dependent late-LTP (L-LTP) at CA1 synapses that is NMDA-receptor independent. This form of plasticity was completely blocked by the selective CP-AMPAR inhibitor IEM-1460, and found to be dependent on postsynaptic Ca(2+) ions through calcium chelator (BAPTA) studies. Surprisingly, Ca/CaM-dependent kinase II (CaMKII), the key protein kinase that is indispensable for NMDA-receptor dependent LTP at CA1 synapses appeared to be not required for the induction of CP-AMPAR dependent LTP due to the lack of effect of two separate pharmacological inhibitors (KN-62 and staurosporine) on this form of potentiation. Both KN-62 and staurosporine strongly inhibited NMDA-receptor dependent LTP in control studies. In contrast, inhibitors for PI3-kinase (LY294002 and wortmannin) or the MAPK cascade (PD98059 and U0126) significantly attenuated this CP-AMPAR-dependent LTP. Similarly, postsynaptic infusion of tetanus toxin (TeTx) light chain, an inhibitor of exocytosis, also had a significant inhibitory effect on this form of LTP. These results suggest that distinct synaptic signaling underlies GluR2-lacking CP-AMPAR-dependent LTP, and reinforces the recent notions that CP-AMPARs are important facilitators of synaptic plasticity in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W2061583388,"Kallikreins-related peptidases (KLKs) are serine proteases and have been implicated in the desquamation process of the skin. Their activity is tightly controlled by epidermal protease inhibitors like the lympho-epithelial Kazal-type inhibitor (LEKTI). Defects of the LEKTI-encoding gene serine protease inhibitor Kazal type (Spink)5 lead to the absence of LEKTI and result in the genodermatose Netherton syndrome, which mimics the common skin disease atopic dermatitis. Since many KLKs are expressed in human skin with KLK5 being considered as one of the most important KLKs in skin desquamation, we proposed that more inhibitors are present in human skin. Herein, we purified from human stratum corneum by HPLC techniques a new KLK5-inhibiting peptide encoded by a member of the Spink family, designated as Spink9 located on chromosome 5p33.1. This peptide is highly homologous to LEKTI and was termed LEKTI-2. Recombinant LEKTI-2 inhibited KLK5 but not KLK7, 14 or other serine proteases tested including trypsin, plasmin and thrombin. Spink9 mRNA expression was detected in human skin samples and in cultured keratinocytes. LEKTI-2 immune-expression was focally localized at the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum at palmar and plantar sites in close localization to KLK5. At sites of plantar hyperkeratosis, LEKTI-2 expression was increased. We suggest that LEKTI-2 contributes to the regulation of the desquamation process in human skin by specifically inhibiting KLK5."
https://openalex.org/W2026087264,"Calcineurin phosphatase plays a crucial role in T cell activation. Dephosphorylation of the nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFATs) by calcineurin is essential for activating cytokine gene expression and, consequently, the immune response. Current immunosuppressive protocols are based mainly on calcineurin inhibitors, cyclosporine A and FK506. Unfortunately, these drugs are associated with severe side effects. Therefore, immunosuppressive agents with higher selectivity and lower toxicity must be identified. The immunosuppressive role of the family of proteins regulators of calcineurin (RCAN, formerly known as DSCR1) which regulate the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway, has been described recently. Here, we identify and characterize the minimal RCAN sequence responsible for the inhibition of calcineurin-NFAT signaling in vivo. The RCAN-derived peptide spanning this sequence binds to calcineurin with high affinity. This interaction is competed by a peptide spanning the NFAT PXIXIT sequence, which binds to calcineurin and facilitates NFAT dephosphorylation and activation. Interestingly, the RCAN-derived peptide does not inhibit general calcineurin phosphatase activity, which suggests that it may have a specific immunosuppressive effect on the calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway. As such, the RCAN-derived peptide could either be considered a highly selective immunosuppressive compound by itself or be used as a new tool for identifying innovative immunosuppressive agents. We developed a low throughput assay, based on the RCAN1-calcineurin interaction, which identifies dipyridamole as an efficient in vivo inhibitor of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway that does not affect calcineurin phosphatase activity.

Neilson J.R. Crabtree G.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2003; 15: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Activated Cn dephosphorylates many substrates, including the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) 1–4 transcription factors, thereby inducing their translocation to the cell nucleus. Nuclear NFAT is a key component of the cytokine gene expression stimulation that triggers T cell activation (2Macian F. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2005; 5: 472-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar). Cn-induced NFAT dephosphorylation is regulated by a Cn-NFAT protein-protein interaction that involves the NFAT PXIXIT motif, which is crucial for NFAT activation and signaling (3Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Current immunosuppressive protocols in transplantation therapies and in the treatment of autoimmune diseases include the administration of cyclosporine A (CsA) or FK506. These drugs are potent inhibitors of Cn phosphatase activity (4Fruman D.A. Klee C.B. Bierer B.E. Burakoff S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The binding of these drugs to intracellular immunophilin receptors, before the interaction with calcineurin, induces complete suppression of Cn phosphatase activity (5Ke H. Huai Q. Biochem. Biophys.

In humans, this family has three members: RCAN1, RCAN2, and RCAN3. RCAN1 has two different and independent Cn-interacting motifs: CIC (Cn inhibitor of Calcipressin) and PXIXXT. In contrast, the interaction between RCAN3 and Cn appears to be driven solely by the CIC motif. Although RCAN proteins can contain both of these Cn-binding sites, only the RCAN CIC motif (consensus sequence in mammals is LGPGEKYELHA(G/A)T(D/E)(S/T)TPSVVV HVC(E/D)S) is responsible for inhibiting Cn-NFAT-dependent signaling in human T cells and, as a result, T cell activation (12Aubareda A.

In the present study, we characterized a minimal RCAN-derived sequence (part of the RCAN CIC motif) that retains the ability to inhibit Cn-NFAT signaling in vivo. The peptides spanning this sequence, RCAN1198–218 from RCAN1 and RCAN3183–203 from RCAN3, were used to conduct a detailed analysis of the RCAN-Cn-binding mechanism. In vitro, these RCAN-derived peptides bind to Cn with high affinity and selectively inhibit the interaction of Cn with NFAT. Our results also suggest that the RCAN-derived peptides impede Cn interaction with the NFAT PXIXIT motif but not with the NFAT LXVP motif. Interestingly, the RCAN-derived peptides characterized here are specific inhibitors of the Cn-NFAT signaling pathway but do not inhibit general Cn phosphatase activity in vitro. Consequently, these peptides could have a favorable profile for immunosuppressive therapy. We hypothesized that these peptides could serve as valuable pharmacological tools for identifying new immunosuppressant compounds. By screening chemical and peptide libraries, we identified dipyridamole to be a regulator of the RCAN-Cn interaction that inhibits the Cn-NFAT signaling pathway in vivo. Plasmid Construct-Overlapping EGFP·RCAN fusion proteins for RCAN1-1 (NCBI accession number AAP96743) and RCAN3-2 (NCBI accession number AF176116) were designed and expressed using standard techniques (12Aubareda A.

Similar procedures were used to synthesize the N-terminal carboxyfluorescein derivatives. Fully deprotected cleaved peptides were precipitated in cold t-butyl methyl ether, centrifuged, dissolved in acetic acid, lyophilized, and purified by reversed phase-high pressure liquid chromatography (17Vilar M.

MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to confirm peptide identity. FK506 was kindly provided by Fujisawa. Dipyridamole and FKBP12 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Pyrimidopyrimidine was synthesized at IIQAB (CSIC, Barcelona, Spain). In Vivo Cellular Assays-COS-7 and U-2 OS cells were transiently transfected with pFLAG-NFAT1 or pNFAT1-EYFP and different EGFP·RCAN plasmids to analyze the inhibition of NFAT nuclear import. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with EGFP·RCAN1 fusion proteins to analyze their interaction with endogenous Cn in co-immunoprecipitation assays. Jurkat cells were electroporated with different EGFP· RCAN plasmids and the 3xNFAT-luciferase reporter to analyze NFAT activity. Endogenous cytokine NFAT-dependent gene expression of Jurkat cells, either untreated or treated with dipyridamole, was analyzed by reverse transcription-PCR. All protocols were performed as described previously (12Aubareda A. Mulero M.C. Perez-Riba M. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Mulero M.C. Aubareda A.

Fluorescence Polarization Measurement and Library Screening-Binding and competition assays were performed on a Wallac VICTOR2 1420 multilabel high throughput screening counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For a detailed description of the assay, see the supplemental data. The truncated human CnAα-(2–347) protein (hereafter referred to as CnA), which contains the catalytic domain and the linker region (see supplemental Fig. 2A for a schematic representation), was used to characterize protein-peptide interactions due to its proven ability to bind NFAT (18Garcia-Cozar F.J.

The Prestwick Chemical Library® was initially screened at 100 μm, and compounds promoting a >45% displacement of the RCAN1198–218-CnA interaction were evaluated in dose-dependent assays. Calcineurin Phosphatase Activity-Cn phosphatase activity was analyzed using the calcineurin cellular assay kit PLUS (BIOMOL International LP) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with the modifications noted in the supplemental data. Identification of the Minimal RCAN Sequence Responsible for Inhibiting the Cn-NFAT Signaling Pathway in Vivo-Immunosupression of the Cn-NFAT signaling pathway in vivo by RCAN proteins is caused by the RCAN CIC motif, which spans amino acids 191–218 for RCAN1 and 178–203 for RCAN3 (12Aubareda A. Mulero M.C. Perez-Riba M. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Mulero M.C. Aubareda A. Schluter A. Perez-Riba M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In this report, we present the minimal RCAN CIC inhibitor consensus sequence, spanning amino acids 198–218 for RCAN1 and 183–203 for RCAN3, that retains this immunosuppressive role (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). These RCAN sequences are directly responsible for inhibiting NFAT nuclear translocation in calcium-stimulated cells (Fig. 1A, compare EGFP·RCAN1-(2–252) full-length protein and EGFP· RCAN1-(198–218) and EGFP·RCAN3-(183–203) proteins with mock vector, FLAG-NFAT1, red panels). In contrast, a full-length RCAN1 mutant lacking this specific sequence fails to inhibit Cn-regulated NFAT nuclear translocation (Fig. 1A, EGFP·RCAN1 (Δ200–219); FLAG-NFAT1, red panel). However, this RCAN1 mutant retains the ability to bind in vivo to endogenous Cn (Fig. 1B, IP α-CnA, lane 5) due to the presence of the PXIXXT motif, which is an additional Cn-interacting motif in RCAN1 (12Aubareda A. Mulero M.C. Perez-Riba M. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1430-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both EGFP·RCAN1-(198–218) and EGFP·RCAN3-(188–203) fusion proteins inhibit NFAT-driven promoters in a dose-dependent manner, with activity comparable with that of the full-length proteins (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that the inhibitory activity of RCAN proteins on the Cn-NFAT signaling pathway is specifically dependent on the minimal RCAN inhibitory consensus sequence identified here. On the strength of these data, we synthesized a series of RCAN-derived peptides, RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203 (Fig. 1, D and E), which do not contain the RCAN PXIXXT motif, and analyzed in vitro the molecular basis of their binding to Cn. RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203 Peptides Bind to CnA with High Affinity-The protein-protein interaction between RCAN1 and Cn is well established in the literature (8Gorlach J. Fox D.S. Cutler N.S.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8719-8725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). However, the only biochemical characterization reported for this interaction involves Cn and a long polypeptide spanning the RCAN1-(196–252) C-terminal amino acids. This RCAN1 region contains both the CIC and the PXIXXT Cn-binding motifs (20Chan B. Greenan G. McKeon F. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, our in vivo results show that the RCAN PXIXXT motif is not essential for exerting a functional inhibitory effect on the Cn-NFAT signaling pathway (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). The RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203 peptides, whose sequences include part of the RCAN CIC but not the RCAN PXIXXT motif (Fig. 1E), were used to obtain a more detailed characterization of the Cn-RCAN interaction. Importantly, this study is the first biochemical analysis of the recently identified Cn-RCAN3 interaction (13Mulero M.C. Aubareda A. Schluter A. Perez-Riba M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We used human CnA and the carboxyfluorescein (CF)-labeled RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203 peptides (CF-RCAN1198–218 and CF-RCAN3183–203, respectively) to explore the protein-peptide interactions by fluorescence anisotropy spectroscopy (21Perez-Paya E. Dufourcq J. Braco L. Abad C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1329: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Both the CF-RCAN1198–218 and the CF-RCAN3183–203 peptide bind to CnA (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively) with apparent dissociation constants (Kd) in the low physiological micromolar range (Fig. 2E). The interaction between CnA and the RCAN-derived peptides was also confirmed qualitatively by peptide-protein cross-linking followed by mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) analysis (data not shown). The specificity of the CF-RCAN1198–218-CnA interaction was assessed by conducting competition experiments with the unlabeled peptide RCAN1198–218, which competed effectively with the interaction, and with a non-related and a scrambled peptide (see “Experimental Procedures”), both of which were unable to compete with the interaction (Fig. 2C). Similar experiments demonstrated the specificity for the binding of CF-RCAN3183–203 to CnA (Fig. 2D). As expected, due to the high amino acid conservation in both RCAN-derived peptides, cross-competition experiments showed cross-affinity for the CnA-binding site (Fig. 2E, see corresponding apparent IC50 values), which suggests that both peptides could interact with the same CnA region. In conclusion, our results show that both RCAN-derived peptides interact specifically and with high affinity with CnA. The CnA-binding PXIXIT Sequence in NFAT Interferes with RCAN-CnA Interaction-Previous reports have demonstrated that two independent NFAT motifs participate in the NFAT-CnA interaction: the PXIXIT motif, which binds to Cn and facilitates NFAT dephosphorylation and activation (3Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), and the LXVP motif (22Park S. Uesugi M. Verdine G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7130-7135Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) (see supplemental Fig. 2B for a schematic representation). We wanted to determine whether the RCAN-derived peptides could inhibit NFAT dephosphorylation by interfering with the Cn-binding sequence motifs in NFAT (Fig. 3). In fact, a peptide derived from the human NFAT1 PXIXIT motif (called PXIXIT) competed strongly with the interactions between CnA and the RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203 peptides (Fig. 3, A and B; apparent IC50 values are shown in Fig. 3E). Similar results (data not shown) were observed when competition experiments were performed with the previously reported VIVIT peptide (16Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), which is a high affinity Cn-binding peptide optimized from the NFAT PXIXIT natural sequence. In contrast, a peptide derived from the NFAT2 LXVP motif (called LXVP) only showed competition at high peptide concentrations (Fig. 3, C and D). An analog peptide in which alanine residues replace the key amino acids of the LXVP peptide (13Mulero M.C. Aubareda A. Schluter A. Perez-Riba M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1773: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) (called mutLXVP, see “Experimental Procedures”) showed no competition (Fig. 3, C and D; apparent IC50 values are summarized in Fig. 3E). As a control, we confirmed that the NFAT peptides PXIXIT and LXVP, but not mutLXVP, were able to compete with the NFAT PXIXIT-CnA interaction in vitro, which suggests that these peptides bind effectively to CnA (data not shown). Overall, these results suggest that RCAN proteins disrupt NFAT binding to CnA. This is caused by the interference between either RCAN1198–218 or RCAN3183–203 and the NFAT PXIXIT peptide, which is crucial in the recognition and dephosphorylation of NFAT by Cn and, by extension, in NFAT activation (3Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Raghavan A. Okamura H. Rao A. Hogan P.G. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has recently been reported that the NFAT PXIXIT sequence motif interacts with CnA through the CnA catalytic domain (amino acids 70–333) (19Takeuchi K. Roehrl M.H. Sun Z.Y. Wagner G. Structure (Camb.). 2007; 15: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Li H. Zhang L. Rao A. Harrison S.C. Hogan P.G. J. Mol.

Chem. 2006; 281: 6227-6235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Our competition experiments strongly support the hypothesis that the RCAN-derived peptides interact with CnA through the Cn catalytic domain, as described for the NFAT PXIXIT sequence motif (19Takeuchi K. Roehrl M.H. Sun Z.Y. Wagner G. Structure (Camb.). 2007; 15: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Li H. Zhang L. Rao A. Harrison S.C. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 1296-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The RCAN-derived Peptides Do Not Inhibit General Cn Phosphatase Activity-The RCAN1 C-terminal region (which includes the CIC and the PXIXXT sequences that bind Cn) has been found to inhibit Cn phosphatase activity on the synthetic substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate (20Chan B. Greenan G. McKeon F. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Ryeom S. Greenwald R.J. Sharpe A.H. McKeon F. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). An in vitro enzyme assay was performed to evaluate the effect of the RCAN-derived peptides on Cn phosphatase activity (Fig. 4A). The RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203 peptides do not inhibit the enzymatic activity of Cn toward the phosphorylated RII peptide substrate (Fig. 4A). As a control, the NFAT LXVP peptide (but not the mut-LXVP) (24Martinez-Martinez S. Rodriguez A. Lopez-Maderuelo M.D. Ortega-Perez I. Vazquez J. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6227-6235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) inhibited Cn phosphatase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, protein-peptide cross-linking and mass spectrometry analyses showed that the phosphorylated RII peptide is able to bind CnA under our experimental conditions (Fig. 4B). Finally, in agreement with the results shown in Fig. 4A, the phosphorylated RII peptide does not compete with the RCAN1198–218-CnA or RCAN3183–203-CnA interactions (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that both RCAN-derived peptides bind to the catalytic domain of CnA without directly affecting the catalytic activity of Cn. This contrasts with CsA and FK506 immunosuppressant drugs, which totally abrogate general Cn phosphatase activity. Therefore, from a therapeutic perspective, the RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203 peptides could be considered novel, highly specific compounds with which to define new specific immunosuppressive drugs. Dipyridamole Interferes with in Vivo Cn-NFAT Signaling-Based on the specific immunosuppressive potential of the RCAN-derived peptides toward the Cn-NFAT signaling pathway, we screened several chemical libraries to identify molecules capable of disrupting the interaction between CnA and the RCAN1198–218 peptide. We first screened a hexapeptide-based library (26Lopez-Garcia B. Perez-Paya E. Marcos J.F. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2002; 68: 2453-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Canela N.

Perez-Paya E. Cell Death Differ. 2006; 13: 1523-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar); however, no suitable hit was found. We then screened the Prestwick Chemical Library®, which comprises 880 biologically active molecules with high chemical and pharmacological diversity; dipyridamole was identified as a compound that competes with CnA for binding to fluorescently labeled RCAN1198–218 peptide. Dipyridamole has been found to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-α production in activated human peripheral blood leukocytes (32Borisy A.A. Elliott P.J. Hurst N.W. Lee M.S. Lehar J. Price E.R. Serbedzija G. Zimmermann G.R. Foley M.A. Stockwell B.R. Keith C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7977-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), but the mechanism responsible for this activity has not yet been described. Moreover, it is difficult to establish a molecular characterization of the mechanism by which dipyridamole binds to CnA due to the intrinsic fluorescence of the molecule. To address this problem, we performed a functional evaluation of the inhibitory effect of dipyridamole on Cn-NFAT signaling (Fig. 5). First, we analyzed the in vitro effect of dipyridamole on Cn phosphatase activity. Our results show that dipyridamole does not inhibit general Cn phosphatase activity (Fig. 5A), which is also the case of RCAN-derived peptides (Fig. 4A). Next, we performed several experiments to determine the in vivo effect of dipyridamole on Cn-NFAT signaling. Dipyridamole inhibits NFAT nuclear translocation in vivo at 50 μm (Fig. 5B). In addition, dipyridamole, but not its synthetic analog pyrimidopyrimidine, specifically inhibits an NFAT-driven promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5C). Consequently, cytokine NFAT-dependent transcription is affected in a dose-dependent manner in human T cells (Fig. 5D). Our in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate the dipyridamole-dependent inhibition of the Cn-NFAT signaling pathway. This inhibitory effect on Cn seems to be specific to the NFAT substrates because dipyridamole does not affect general Cn phosphatase activity. These data constitute the first experimental identification of a disrupter of the interaction between Cn and RCAN in vitro that affects Cn-NFAT dependent signaling in vivo. RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203 Are High Affinity CnA-binding Peptides-We have identified the minimal RCAN region, RCAN1-(198–218) and RCAN3-(183–203), responsible for in vivo inhibition of the Cn-NFAT signaling pathway (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 1). More importantly, biochemical characterization of the interaction between two RCAN-derived peptides spanning these sequences (RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203) and CnA has revealed that both RCAN-derived peptides interact with high affinity with CnA through a region located between amino acids 2 and 347. This region includes the CnA catalytic domain (residues 70–333) and the linker region (residues 335–347) (Fig. 2, A and B, and supplemental Fig. 2A). These results reinforce previous evidence indicating a putative role of the CnA catalytic domain and linker region in binding to RCAN1 (10Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Perez-Riba M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Rothermel B. Vega R.B. Yang J. Wu H. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8719-8725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). These regions have also been implicated in CnA binding to NFAT and other Cn inhibitor proteins such as Cabin1 and AKAP79 (5Ke H. Huai Q. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 311: 1095-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 33Rodriguez A. Martinez-Martinez S. Lopez-Maderuelo M.D. Ortega-Perez I. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9980-9984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that different Cn endogenous inhibitors may interact with Cn through closely related regions. The NFAT PXIXIT Sequence Interferes with the Interaction between RCAN-derived Peptides and CnA-The regulatory mechanism by which Cn binds to NFAT or RCAN proteins is a matter of speculation due to the presence of different Cn-binding sites in NFAT (the PXIXIT and LXVP motif sequences) and in RCAN (the CIC and PXIXXT motif sequences). RCAN proteins have been found in different cell systems to interfere in vivo with Cn-NFAT signaling (10Fuentes J.J. Genesca L. Kingsbury T.J. Cunningham K.W. Perez-Riba M. Estivill X. de la Luna S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1681-1690Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Chan B. Greenan G. McKeon F. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Blood. 2004; 104: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In addition, the RCAN1-4 protein isoform has been found to compete for Cn binding with the VIVIT peptide, which is a peptide derivative of the NFAT PXIXIT sequence motif (35Vega R.B. Yang J. Rothermel B.A. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30401-30407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, a detailed identification of the RCAN sequence responsible for these molecular events was not carried out. The competition experiments presented here describe for the first time the existence of direct competition between RCAN-derived peptides and the NFAT1 PXIXIT peptide for binding to CnA. Therefore, these results could potentially be extrapolated to full-length proteins. The functional consequence of this competition is to prevent NFAT activation and, subsequently, T cell activation. Our results also suggest that the RCAN-derived peptides could bind to CnA through a region that either partially overlaps or is proximal to where the NFAT PXIXIT motif binds. However, we cannot rule out that binding of one peptide (the RCAN-derived peptides) to any other calcineurin domain could affect the enzyme conformation and binding to the other peptide (NFAT PXIXIT peptide). We hypothesized that both RCAN peptides would interact within the catalytic domain of CnA through a region located outside the CnA active site and probably without direct participation of the linker region. This hypothesis is further supported by the recent structural characterization of the protein-protein surface interaction, defined by binding of the VIVIT peptide (16Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) to CnA (19Takeuchi K. Roehrl M.H. Sun Z.Y. Wagner G. Structure (Camb.). 2007; 15: 587-597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Li H. Zhang L. Rao A. Harrison S.C. Hogan P.G. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 1296-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The surface is defined by direct interaction of an exposed short β-strand of CnA and by the β-sheet conformation adopted by the VIVIT peptide. The structure of the complex did not reveal any interactions between the CnA linker region and the peptide. Finally, taking into consideration our data here presented (Fig. 3E), we cannot discard that the NFAT LXVP peptide could also play some role in the competition of the RCAN-derived peptides interaction with CnA. Nevertheless, this competitive effect would be expected to be in a lesser extent than the one mediated by the NFAT PXIXIT peptide. Further experiments would need to be addressed to clarify this point. The RCAN-derived Peptides Do Not Inhibit General Cn Phosphatase Activity-One of the main findings of the present study is that the RCAN-derived peptides do not inhibit Cn phosphatase activity toward phosphorylated RII peptide substrate (Fig. 4A). In addition, the LXVP peptide, which significantly blocks RII dephosphorylation by Cn (24Martinez-Martinez S. Rodriguez A. Lopez-Maderuelo M.D. Ortega-Perez I. Vazquez J. Redondo J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 6227-6235Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), only competed with the RCAN-derived peptides for binding to CnA at high concentrations (Fig. 3, C and D). Neither CsA-cyclophilin A nor FK506-FKBP12 complexes competed with the CnA-RCAN-derived peptide interactions, although both interact with CnA under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Overall, these results suggest that the interaction between RCAN-derived peptides and CnA does not involve the direct participation of the CnA active site. These data differ from those of previous reports, in which the complete C-terminal region of RCAN1 was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of Cn in a phosphatase activity assay using the p-nitrophenyl phosphate or synthetic RII peptide as substrates (20Chan B. Greenan G. McKeon F. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 13075-13080Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 25Ryeom S. Greenwald R.J. Sharpe A.H. McKeon F. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 874-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here, we used well defined C-terminal RCAN-derived peptides, which do not include the RCAN PXIXXT motif and enabled fine characterization of the RCAN motif that inhibits Cn-NFAT signaling in vivo. Interestingly, the RCAN-derived peptides do not abolish Cn phosphatase activity in vitro, unlike CsA or FK506. This suggests that the Cn inhibitory effect of these peptides might be specific to NFAT dephosphorylation. RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203 Are Potential Immunosuppressive Peptides That Could Be Used as Screening Tools-Our data suggest a potential model for the mechanism by which the RCAN-derived peptides bind to Cn via its catalytic domain, through a region located outside the active site. In this position, the RCAN-derived peptides would not inhibit Cn phosphatase activity but would selectively interfere with the Cn-binding PXIXIT motif of NFAT. This effect would, in turn, prevent NFAT dephosphorylation and, as a result, T cell activation. RCAN-derived peptides might also interfere with CnA-binding sites for other proteins, which could be located close to the RCAN-binding site, although this hypothesis demands further examination. The RCAN-derived peptides identified here could constitute novel, selective immunosuppressive lead candidates and potential therapeutic alternatives to CsA or FK506, presumably with fewer side effects (16Aramburu J. Yaffe M.B. Lopez-Rodriguez C. Cantley L.C. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Science. 1999; 285: 2129-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar, 36Noguchi H. Matsushita M. Okitsu T. Moriwaki A. Tomizawa K. Kang S. Li S.T. Kobayashi N. Matsumoto S. Tanaka K. Tanaka N. Matsui H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, given the multiple effects of Cn-dependent NFAT activation on cell regulation, we cannot rule out the possibility that NFAT inhibitors that do not affect the Cn active site could also have some toxic side effects. Specific experiments must be performed to address this question. Nevertheless, these RCAN-derived peptides could be used to identify new, more specific immunosuppressant drugs through the exploration of alternative Cn-binding sites that may inhibit the Ca2+-Cn-NFAT signaling pathway (15Roehrl M.H.

Chem. 2005; 280: 37698-37706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Therefore, the binding site in CnA for the RCAN-derived peptides may be a new target site for the development of such drugs. Based on this hypothesis, we screened chemical libraries under restrictive assay conditions. By imposing screening constraints, we limited the putative hits to molecules that could compete with CF-RCAN1198–218, bind to its binding site in CnA, and inhibit the protein-protein interaction that produces the active CnA-NFAT complex. The screening identified dipyridamole to be a hit compound for the development of this new class of inhibitors. It competed efficiently with CF-RCAN1198–218 in in vitro CnA binding assays. Dipyridamole also inhibited Cn-dependent NFAT nuclear translocation (Fig. 5B), NFAT activity (Fig. 5C), and NFAT-dependent cytokine gene expression in human T cells (Fig. 5D), without affecting general phosphatase activity (Fig. 5A). Although dipyridamole is widely used in clinical practice as an antiplatelet agent to prevent recurrence of ischemic stroke (39De Schryver E.L. Algra A. van Gijn J. Cochrane Database Syst. Rev. 2003; 1CD001820Google Scholar), in recent years, it has also been suggested that this drug could have an immunomodulatory effect in vivo (32Borisy A.A. Elliott P.J. Hurst N.W. Lee M.S. Lehar J. Price E.R. Serbedzija G. Zimmermann G.R. Foley M.A. Stockwell B.R. Keith C.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7977-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 40Weyrich A.S.

However, the molecular mechanism responsible for this novel role remains unknown. Interestingly, our results suggest that dipyridamole may play a role in immunosuppression and that this role could be regulated through the inhibition of the Cn-NFAT signaling pathway. In summary, we have gained crucial insights into the underlying mechanism of Cn binding to RCAN1 and to RCAN3. When overexpressed in cells, the amino acid sequences of RCAN1-(198–218) and RCAN3-(183–203) inhibit Cn-NFAT signaling, thereby preventing activation of NFAT without affecting Cn phosphatase activity. We have also defined two novel sequences, the RCAN1198–218 and RCAN3183–203 peptides, that could be valuable pharmacological tools. Once the current difficulties of intracellular peptide delivery have been overcome, these synthetic peptides could also prove beneficial in immunosuppressive therapy. Using these peptides as screening tools, we identified dipyridamole to be a hit compound for the development of new immunosuppressant molecules, providing advantages over the currently used drugs CsA and FK506.

Electron microscopic analyses have established that NDH-1/complex I has a characteristic L-shaped structure consisting of two domains, a peripheral arm protruding into the cytoplasm (or the matrix) and a membrane domain embedded within the cytoplasmic membrane (or the inner mitochondrial membrane) (11Guénebaut V. Schlitt A. Weiss H. Leonard K. Friedrich T. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 12Clason T. Zickermann V. Ruiz T. Brandt U. Radermacher M. J. Struct.

The NADH binding site and all known redox cofactors of complex I are located in the peripheral domain (14Yagi T. Dinh T.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5515-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 15Yano T. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28606-28611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This was also confirmed by the crystal structure of the peripheral arm from Thermus thermophilus (16Sazanov L.A. Hinchliffe P. Science. 2006; 311: 1430-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Unlike the peripheral arm, the membrane arm does not contain any prosthetic group identified so far. Information about the structural and functional roles of these membrane domain subunits are rather limited despite recent progress in the field of structural biology. Based on the projection structure of the membrane domain and detergent-based fractionation study that led to the disruption of the membrane arm into fragments containing NuoL/M, NuoA/K/N, and NuoH/J subunits, a speculative arrangement of the membrane segment of E. coli NDH-1 has been proposed, wherein subunits NuoA, NuoK, NuoN, NuoJ, and NuoH are present in the vicinity of the peripheral arm, whereas the NuoL and NuoM subunits are distantly located from the peripheral segment (17Di Bernardo S.

Genet. 2006; 43: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).The ND1 subunit is one of seven mitochondrial-encoded hydrophobic subunits (ND1–6 and 4L) of the membrane arm of complex I. The ND1 subunit is a mutational hot spot for mitochondrial diseases like LHON (24Valentino M.L. Barboni P. Ghelli A. Bucchi L. Rengo C. Achilli A. Torroni A. Lugaresi A. Lodi R. Barbiroli B. Dotti M. Federico A. Baruzzi A. Carelli V. Ann. Neurol. 2004; 56: 631-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and MELAS (25Kirby D.M. McFarland R. Ohtake A. Dunning C. Ryan M.T. Wilson C. Ketteridge D. Turnbull D.M. Thorburn D.R. Taylor R.W. J. Med. Genet. 2004; 41: 784-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), underscoring its physiological role. Subunit NuoH in E. coli (a homolog of the mitochondrial ND1 subunit) is one of the most conserved subunits of the membrane domain. Mutations in the NuoH (Nqo8) subunit from Paracoccus denitrificans were previously reported to alter the affinity of complex I for ubi-Q (26Kurki S. Zickermann V. Kervinen M. Hassinen I. Finel M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13496-13502Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Various inhibitors were reported to label the ND1/NuoH subunit (21Murai M. Ishihara A. Nishioka T. Yagi T. Miyoshi H. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 6409-6416Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Yagi T. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16150-16155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Earley F.G.P.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3264-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Subunit NuoH/ND1 is believed to be involved in Q/inhibitor binding (29Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2266-2274Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The essential role of ND1 on the activity and assembly of complex I was implied earlier in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, in which deletion of the ND1 subunit prevented the assembly of complex I (30Cardol P. Matagne R.F. Remacle C. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1211-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Subunit NuoH/ND1 was thus assumed to play roles in assembly/communication between the peripheral and membrane domains (31Roth R. Hagerhall C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, experimental evidence is lacking. Sequence comparison among various species shows that charged residues in all four cytoplasmic side loops of the NuoH subunit are comprehensively conserved. There are numerous implications for short-range electrostatic forces involved in maintaining subunit-subunit interactions as reported for V-ATPase (32Jones R.P. Durose L.J. Findlay J.B. Harrison M.A. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3933-3941Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the NuoH subunit interacts electrostatically with neighboring subunits by means of these charged amino acids. To investigate the role of the residues that could be associated with subunit-subunit interaction, we have systematically generated a set of point mutations of highly conserved amino acid residues of the NuoH subunit from E. coli, and thus attempted to understand the structural and functional importance of this subunit. The results indicate that NuoH, through its conserved residues in the cytoplasmic side loops, is involved in connecting the membrane arm with the peripheral arm, presumably with the NuoB and/or NuoCD subunit of NDH-1.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials-The pGEM-T Easy Vector was from Promega (Madison, WI).

Sequences of primers used for this purpose are listed in supplemental Table S1. A DNA fragment, which includes the nuoH gene, its upstream 1-kb DNA segment, and its downstream 1-kb DNA segment, was amplified from E. coli DH5α by PCR using primers A and D. The amplified DNA fragment containing the nuoH gene was then cloned into pGEM-T-Easy vector following the manufacturer’s protocol, and its sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. The fragment bearing the nuoH gene was then subcloned into integration vector pKO3. The resulting plasmids were designated pGEM/nuoH-T and pKO3/nuoH-T, respectively (Fig. 1A). Later, a 1-kb DNA upstream segment including the 5′-sequence of the nuoH gene was cloned by PCR using primers A and B, generating fragment nuoH-U. Similarly, a 1-kb DNA downstream segment including the 3′ sequence of the nuoH gene was cloned by PCR using primers C and D, generating fragment nuoH-D. Both fragments were cloned in pGEM-T Easy Vector. The spectinomycin encoding gene from transposon Tn554 of Staphylococcus aureus (33Murphy E. Huwyler L. Freire Bastos M.C. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3357-3365Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) was obtained by PCR amplification using primers E2 and F2, both containing the HindIII restriction site. The spc fragment obtained was cloned in pGEM-T Easy Vector. Furthermore, the spc gene was inserted between nuoH-U and nuoH-D fragments with the help of the HindIII site generating the nuoH(spc) fragment (Fig. 1B) and then assembled in pGEM generating the pGEM/nuoH(spc) plasmid (Fig. 1C). The fragment harboring the spc cassette was finally subcloned in pKO3 with the help of SmaI and SalI restriction sites generating the pKO3/nuoH(spc) plasmid (Fig. 1C). To prepare pKO3 vectors carrying mutated nuoH genes, pGEM/nuoH-T was first mutagenized individually with the synthetic oligonucleotides listed in supplemental Table S1 using the QuikChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions to introduce nuoH point mutations. The generation of the desired mutations was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. The pGEM constructs were then digested with SmaI and SalI, and DNA fragments containing the desired nuoH point mutations were finally transferred to integration plasmid pKO3 at the SmaI/SalI sites. The resulting plasmids were referred to as pKO3/nuoH (mutant). To evaluate possible effects of the entire process of gene manipulation in generation of point mutations on the E. coli cells, we also constructed a control pKO3 vector, using the same procedure except that the wild-type nuoH gene derived from pGEM(nuoH-T) without any mutation was inserted into the SmaI and SalI sites of pKO3.Preparation of nuoH Knock-out and Mutant Cells-E. coli strain MC4100 (F–, araD139, Δ(arg F-lac)U169, ptsF25, relA1, flb5301, rpsL 150.λ–) was used to generate knock-out and site-specific mutations of nuoH employing the pKO3 system. The process was carried out according to the method of Link et al. (34Link A.J. Phillips D. Church G.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6228-6237Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) with a minor modification as described previously by Kao et al. (9Kao M.C. Di Bernardo S. Perego M. Nakamaru-Ogiso E.

E. coli nuoH knock-out (NuoH-KO mutant) was constructed by replacement of the nuoH gene in the nuo operon for the nuoH(spc) fragment inserted in the pKO3 plasmid. The NuoH-KO mutant obtained was verified by PCR sequencing using specific oligonucleotides and stored in glycerol at –80 °C. In subsequent steps the pKO3/nuoH (mutant) plasmids were used for construction of site-directed nuoH mutants. The control mutant (KO-rev) was generated in the same way except that, instead of using pKO3/nuoH (mutant), the pKO3 (nuoH-T) carrying the wild-type nuoH gene was employed in the recombination process. The correct introduction of point mutations in the chromosome was finally confirmed by direct DNA sequencing.Bacterial Growth and Membrane Preparation-The E. coli membrane preparation was done according to Kao et al. (8Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were first grown in LB medium from freshly streaked plates at 37 °C for 10 h and used to inoculate 250 ml of terrific broth and cells were cultivated at 37 °C with shaking until A600 was ∼2. The cells were then harvested and resuspended at 10% (w/v) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 15% (w/v) glycerol. 0.5 mg/ml of lysozyme was added to the cell suspension followed by incubation on ice for 30 min and sonicated twice with a 15-s pulse. The cell suspension was then passed twice through the “French pressure cell press” at 25,000 p.s.i. After cell debris was removed, the supernatant was ultracentrifuged at 50,000 × g for 35 min in a Beckman Spinco 60Ti rotor. The collected pellet was resuspended in the same buffer, and the resulting membrane suspension was either used immediately for enzyme assays or stored in small aliquots at –80 °C for later use.Gel Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting Analysis-10 μg of protein from each membrane suspension was first subjected to SDS-PAGE using the discontinuous system of Laemmli (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206048) Google Scholar). The expression of the NDH-1 subunits was then determined by using antibodies specific to NuoB, NuoCD, NuoE, NuoF, NuoG, NuoI, and NuoM in Western blot experiments. The assembly of NDH-1 was evaluated by using BN-PAGE according to Schägger and von Jagow (36Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1886) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (10Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36914-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). For NADH dehydrogenase activity staining of NDH-1 gels were incubated in 2 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 2.5 mg/ml of p-nitro blue tetrazolium and 150 μm NADH for 2 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 7% acetic acid.Enzymatic Assay-In addition to NDH-1, E. coli also contains an alternative NADH-Q oxidoreductase, NDH-2. The E. coli NDH-2 is a small, FAD-dependent enzyme that is insensitive to capsaicin (37Satoh T. Miyoshi H. Sakamoto K. Iwamura H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 38Yagi T. Arch. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7732-7737Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, to measure the activities derived solely from NDH-1, we used dNADH as the substrate in enzymatic assays throughout this study. All measurements of enzymatic activity were carried out at 30 °C using a Olis-SLM DW-2000 spectrophotometer. The dNADH oxidase activity was assayed at 340 nm as described previously (10Torres-Bacete J. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 36914-36922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The dNADH-DB reductase activity measurements were conducted in the presence of 10 mm KCN, 0.15 mm dNADH, and 0.1 mm DB. The dNADH-K3Fe(CN)6 reductase activity was measured at 420 nm in the presence of 10 mm KCN, 0.15 mm dNADH, and 1 mm K3Fe(CN)6. The ∈340 = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1 for dNADH and ∈420 = 1.00 mm–1 cm–1 for K3Fe(CN)6 were used for analyses.The generation of membrane potential by NuoH mutants was monitored optically with indicator dye oxonol VI as described previously (8Kao M.C. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9545-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Kao M.C. Di Bernardo S. Perego M. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Matsuno-Yagi A. Yagi T. J.

The reaction was started by addition of 0.2 mm dNADH and absorbance changes at 630 minus 603 nm were monitored. Proton-pumping activity of NDH-1 was estimated from ACMA fluorescence quenching as described by Amarneh and Vik (40Amarneh B. Vik S.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 4800-4808Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by adding 0.2 mm dNADH.Other Analytical Procedures-Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard according to the manufacturer's instructions. Any variations from the procedures and other details are described in the figure legends.RESULTSSequence Analysis of the NuoH Subunit-The E. coli NuoH subunit is a polypeptide of 325 amino acid residues. A topology of the E. coli NuoH subunit was proposed based on the most reasonable predictions offered by a composite of computer programs including TopPredII (41Claros M.G. Von Heijne G. Comput. Appl.

The E. coli NuoH subunit is predicted to contain eight transmembrane segments (designated TM1–8 from the N to C terminus), with both the N- and C-terminal regions oriented toward the periplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 2). The final model also accommodated the experimentally determined topology of the Rhodobacter capsulatus NuoH subunit (31Roth R. Hagerhall C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Speculative topology of the E. coli NuoH subunit. The prediction has been performed on the basis of a composite of computer programs, including the reported topology of its Rhodobacter counterpart (31Roth R. Hagerhall C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1504: 352-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The eight transmembrane segments of the E. coli NuoH subunit from the N terminus to the C terminus are designated TM1–8. The four cytoplasmic side loops are marked as C1–C4, whereas P1–P3 represent three periplasmic side loops. The N and C terminus of the subunit are exposed to the periplasmic side of the membrane. Amino acid residues mutated in this study are displayed as black squares, and some are marked by their E. coli numbering.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)According to the sequence alignment, many residues were found to be extensively conserved particularly in all four cytoplasmic side loops (C1–4) (supplemental Fig. S1). These loops, especially C1 and C3, are highly enriched in charged residues, indicative of the electrostatic interaction with neighboring subunits. Our data base search revealed that in C1, Arg37, Arg46, Pro49, and Asp63 are almost perfectly conserved among all species examined. Residues Glu36, Gln44, Lys70, and Glu71 are highly conserved except that, in some species, they are replaced by some other similar residues. Similarly, C3 contains Asp213, Glu220, and Glu228 as almost invariant residues, whereas Arg209, Glu216, and Glu218 are highly conserved. It should be noted that most of these residues are also conserved in the EchB, HycD, and HyfC subunits of multisubunit membrane-bound energy-converting [Ni-Fe] Ech hydrogenase, hydrogenase 3, and hydrogenase 4 complexes, respectively.Subunit ND1 is described to be a mutational hot spot for LHON (24Valentino M.L.

Oxygen consumption rates and electron transport chain complex activities were titrated with appropriate inhibitors to determine the flux control coefficients and the inhibition thresholds in rat brain synaptosomes. The flux control coefficients for complex I, complex II/III, complex III, and complex IV were found to be 0.30 ± 0.07, 0.20 ± 0.03, 0.20 ± 0.05, and 0.08 ± 0.05, respectively. Inhibition thresholds for complex I, complex II/III, complex III, and complex IV activities were determined to be ∼10, ∼30, ∼35, and 50–65%, respectively, before major changes in oxygen consumption rates were observed. These results indicate that, of the electron transport chain components, complex I exerts a high level of control over synaptosomal bioenergetics, suggesting that complex I deficiencies that are present in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease, are sufficient to compromise oxygen consumption in the synaptosomal model of the nerve terminal.

Complex I (EC 1.6.5.3) activity is decreased by 30–40% in the substantia nigra region of the parkinsonian brain postmortem (4Schapira A.H. Cooper J.M. Dexter D. Clark J.B. Jenner P. Marsden C.D. J. Neurochem. 1990; 54: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). More recently, it was found that complex I is reduced in the frontal cortex of the PD brain (5Parker Jr., W.D. Parks J.K. Swerdlow R.H. Brain Res. 2008; 1189: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). This finding, together with the observations of a mutation in the mitochondrial DNA encoding the ND5 subunit of complex I, has lead to suggestions that the complex I decrease may be evident throughout the parkinsonian brain (7Smigrodzki R.

Commun. 2005; 326: 667-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Postmortem studies on the Alzheimer brain found that complex IV (EC 1.9.3.1) activity was reduced by ∼27% in the cerebral cortex, by ∼37% in the temporal cortex, and by ∼52% in the hippocampus (1Kish S.J.

Examination of the respiratory chain complexes in the brains of Huntington disease patients showed decreased complex II/III (EC 1.8.3.1) activity in the caudate (∼29%) and putamen (∼67%) and reduced complex IV activity in the putamen (∼62%) and caudate nucleus (∼30%) in mitochondrial membranes (3Browne S.E.

Using a metabolic control analysis approach, respiratory chain complexes were found to have different flux control coefficient (FCC) values and inhibition threshold levels depending on the tissue source (9Rossignol R.

The FCC is a measure of the control exerted by an individual ETC complex over oxidative phosphorylation.

However, these studies do not take into account channeling of respiratory substrates to the mitochondria inside a neuron or nerve terminal, which may possibly lead to differences in energy states when compared with in vivo mitochondria. This paper determined the FCCs and inhibition thresholds for complex I, complex II/III, complex III (EC 1.10.2.2), and complex IV over the control of oxygen consumption in in situ mitochondria in rat brain synaptosomes. Materials-Female Wistar rats (∼250 g) were provided by the Bioresources Unit, Biochemistry Department, Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland. Chemicals were supplied by Sigma or by BDH, Dagenham, Essex, UK. Preparation of Synaptosomes-The method of synaptosome preparation was based on that by Lai and Clark (14Lai J.C. Clark J.B. Biochem. J. 1976; 154: 423-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Two female Wistar rats were killed by cervical dislocation, and the brains were chopped, rinsed, and homogenized using glass Kontes homogenizing tube in STE buffer (320 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 3 min. Subsequently the supernatants were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The pellets were resuspended and placed on a discontinuous Ficoll gradient and were centrifuged in an ultracentrifuge at 28,000 rpm for 45 min at 4 °C. Synaptosomes were removed from the Ficoll gradient, were resuspended in STE buffer, and were stored on ice. The protein concentration was calculated using the method of Bradford (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215653) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as the reference standard. Oxygen Consumption Experiments-The rate of synaptosomal oxygen consumption (JO2) was determined using a Clark-type oxygen electrode. Synaptosomes (1 mg/ml) were incubated in Krebs buffer (3 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm glucose, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) at 37 °C in the reaction chamber, and the appropriate inhibitor was added, giving a final volume of 3 ml. The inhibitors were chosen according to the complex of interest; rotenone was used to inhibit complex I activity, myxothiazol to inhibit complex II/III and complex III activities, and KCN to inhibit complex IV activity. The rates of oxygen consumption were monitored for 6–7 min before the reaction was stopped, and the samples were stored at –80 °C for spectrophotometric examination of complex activities. Electron Transport Chain Assays-The samples prepared from the oxygen consumption experiments were freeze-fractured three times using liquid nitrogen and were examined for their corresponding complex activity. All assays were performed on a Cary UV spectrophotometer at 37 °C. The method used to measure complex I activity was based on a modification of the method of Ragan et al. (16Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T.

IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 79-112Google Scholar), which involved monitoring the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm. 100 μg of synaptosomes were added to plastic cuvettes containing reaction buffer (10 mm MgCl2 and 25 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4) 0.15 mm NADH, 2.5 mg of bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm KCN, giving a final volume of 1 ml. Decylubiquinone (50 μm) was added to start the reaction, and the rates were monitored for 7–8 min. Rotenone (10 μm) was added to obtain the rotenone-insensitive rate for a further 5–6 min. Complex II/III activity was determined using a modification of the method of King (17King T.S. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 217-235Google Scholar), which followed the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm. Samples (50 μg of synaptosomal protein) were added to plastic cuvettes containing buffer (100 mm potassium phosphate, 0.3 mm potassium-EDTA, pH 7.4), 1 mm KCN, and 100 μm cytochrome c with a final volume of 1 ml. The reaction was initiated by the addition of succinate (20 mm). After 7–8 min, myxothiazol (1 μm) was added to determine the myxothiazol-insensitive rate. Complex III activity was examined using an assay based on the method of Ragan et al. (16Ragan C.I. Wilson M.T. Darley-Usmar V.M. Lowe P.N. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Mitochondria, A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1987: 79-112Google Scholar), which monitored the oxidation of decylubiquinol as an increase in absorbance at 550 nm. Decylubiquinol was prepared from the reduction of decylubiquinone with sodium borohydride and extraction in cyclohexane, dried under nitrogen. The reaction mixture consisted of 25 mm potassium phosphate, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.2, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm KCN, 100 μm oxidized cytochrome c, 600 μm n-dodecyl β-maltoside, 35 μm decylubiquinol, and 10 μm rotenone in 1-ml plastic cuvettes. The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μg of synaptosomal samples, and the rates were followed for 7–8 min. A few grains of ascorbate were added to reduce the remaining cytochrome c. The results were expressed as first-order decay rate constants (k). The activity of complex IV was determined using the method of Wharton and Tzagoloff (18Wharton D.C. Tzagoloff A. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 10: 245-250Crossref Scopus (1330) Google Scholar), which monitored the oxidation of cytochrome c by complex IV as a decrease in absorbance at 550 nm. Cytochrome c was reduced with ascorbic acid and passed through a PD10 gel filtration column. The assay cuvettes contained 50 μm reduced cytochrome c and 100 μl of potassium phosphate buffer (100 mm), pH 7.0, with a final volume of 1 ml made up with water. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 50 μg of synaptosomes. The results were expressed as first-order decay rate constants (k). Calculation of Flux Control Coefficients-Metabolic control analysis (19Heinrich R. Rapoport T.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 42: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar, 20Kacser H. Burns J.A. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1973; 27: 65-104PubMed Google Scholar) was used to determine the FCCs for the complexes of interest (Equation 1).FCC=(dJO2/d(inhibitor)/dVc/d(inhibitor))Eq. 1 dJO2/d(inhibitor) is the rate of change of oxygen consumption (entire flux) at low concentrations of the inhibitor, and dVc/d(inhibitor) is the rate of change of the complex activity at low concentrations of the inhibitor. The lines fitted to the complex activity and oxygen consumption data, at low concentrations of inhibitor, generated r2 values above 0.9 for the calculations of FCCs. Titration of Complex I Activity-Increasing concentrations of rotenone decreased the rate of synaptosomal oxygen consumption and the activity of complex I (Fig. 1). Complex I activity decreased linearly to 90% over the rotenone concentration range of 0–1 nm; however, oxygen consumption rates remained between 100 and 97%. As the concentration of rotenone increased above 1 nm, both rates decreased rapidly, with complex I activity falling more quickly than oxygen consumption. The FCC for complex I was calculated by dividing the rate of oxygen consumption, at lower concentrations of rotenone, by the rate of complex I activity, at lower concentrations of the inhibitor (Equation 1), which gave the FCC for complex I as 0.30 ± 0.07 (Table 1). The threshold level of complex I inhibition was determined from a curve that expressed the rate of synaptosomal oxygen consumption as a function of inhibition of complex I activity (Fig. 2). The complex I inhibition threshold was found to be ∼10%, beyond which the rate of oxygen consumption decreased rapidly. At 40% complex I inhibition, synaptosomal oxygen consumption was reduced by ∼60%.TABLE 1Flux control coefficient values and inhibition thresholds for complexes I, II/III, III, and IV in rat brain synaptosomesRespiratory chain complexFlux control coefficientInhibition threshold%Complex I0.30 ± 0.07∼10Complex II/III0.20 ± 0.03∼30Complex III0.20 ± 0.05∼35Complex IV0.08 ± 0.0250-65 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 2Low inhibition threshold for complex I in rat brain synaptosomes.

Analysis of FCCs from different tissue sources found that oxidative phosphorylation in muscle and heart mitochondria was controlled at the level of the respiratory chain, whereas other factors such as ATP synthase and the phosphate carrier play larger roles, along with the respiratory chain complexes, in the control of oxidative phosphorylation in brain, kidney, and liver mitochondria (9Rossignol R. Letellier T. Malgat M. Rocher C. Mazat J.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Along with differing tissue sources and varying energy states, age can be an additional factor affecting the spread of control. Synaptosomes from young (3 months) and old (24 months) rat brains showed altered patterns of control among substrate oxidation, phosphorylating system, and proton leak in maximally phosphorylating mitochondria (23Joyce O.J. Farmer M.K. Tipton K.F. Porter R.K. J. Neurochem. 2003; 86: 1032-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The results in this paper demonstrate that complex I is the major control point of the ETC complexes for oxygen consumption in nerve terminal mitochondria. The FCC value for complex I (0.30 ± 0.07) was higher than those for complex II/III (0.20 ± 0.03), complex III (0.20 ± 0.05), and complex IV (0.08 ± 0.02), and the complex I inhibition threshold level (∼10%) was lower than those for complex II/III (∼30%), complex III (∼35%), and complex IV (50–65%). Considering the observation that neuronal cells cannot function anaerobically when operating at maximal glycolytic rates (24Pauwels P.J. Opperdoes F.R. Trouet A. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), impaired activity of the respiratory chain complexes (above the threshold levels) may reduce oxygen consumption in the nerve terminal, with subsequent reductions in ATP (11Davey G.P.

The lower inhibition threshold for complex I implies that complex I defects may have the greatest ability, of the ETC complexes examined, to induce a reduced bioenergetic status in the nerve terminal. A 40% reduction in complex I activity, such as that present in PD, would reduce oxygen consumption in the nerve terminal by ∼60%. Metabolic control analysis studies performed on isolated brain mitochondria reported a much lower complex I inhibition threshold for synaptic mitochondria (∼25%) than nonsynaptic mitochondria (∼72%) (11Davey G.P. Peuchen S. Clark J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12753-12757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 12Davey G.P. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). In this study, complex I in the synaptosomal mitochondria was inhibited by only ∼10% before a decrease in oxygen consumption was observed, which is more in accordance with the level calculated for synaptic mitochondria, as would be expected, because a similar sample of mitochondria exists in isolated synaptic mitochondria preparations as in the synaptosomal preparations. A previous study showed that complex I activity was 36% lower in synaptic mitochondria than in nonsynaptic mitochondria (25Almeida A. Brooks K.J. Sammut I. Keelan J. Davey G.P. Clark J.B. Bates T.E. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 212-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which may somewhat explain the lower thresholds obtained in synaptic and synaptosomal mitochondria when compared with nonsynaptic mitochondria. Similarly, a recent study found that complex I activity in C57BL/6J mouse brain synaptic mitochondria was 45% lower than that in nonsynaptic mitochondria (26Kiebish M.A. Han X. Cheng H. Lunceford A. Clarke C.F. Moon H. Chuang J.H. Seyfried T.N. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 299-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Above 20% complex I inhibition, the mitochondrial membrane potential decreased significantly in resting rat brain synaptosomes, and above 40% complex I inhibition, glutamate release was increased, whereas ATP levels were reduced in depolarized rat brain synaptosomes (27Kilbride S.M. Telford J.E. Tipton K.F. Davey G.P. J. Neurochem. 2008; 106: 826-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ∼16% inhibition of complex I activity has been reported to result in increased production of reactive oxygen species in guinea pig synaptosomes (28Sipos I. Tretter L. Adam-Vizi V. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 112-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Thus, adequate complex I activity appears to be crucial for normal mitochondrial function. Those results, examined along with the results from this study, imply that the complex I inhibition above ∼10% could initially cause decreased oxygen consumption, with greater inhibition leading to downstream effects such as mitochondrial membrane potential depolarization, glutamate release, decreased ATP levels, and increased levels of reactive oxygen species. In this study, the inhibition thresholds for complex II/III and complex III were determined. The complex II/III inhibition threshold was found to be ∼30%, and the complex III inhibition threshold was calculated to be ∼35%. The similar inhibition thresholds obtained for complex II/III and complex III imply that complex II does not exert much effect on the complex II/III threshold and that the complex II/III threshold is largely dependent on complex III. In addition, these results suggest that determination of the inhibition threshold and FCC for complex III can be performed by examining complex II/III activity or complex III activity. The synaptosomal complex III inhibition threshold was lower than the thresholds reported for complex III in nonsynaptic mitochondria (∼70%) and synaptic mitochondria (∼80%) (10Rossignol R. Malgat M. Mazat J.P. Letellier T.M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33426-33432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 11Davey G.P. Peuchen S. Clark J.B. J. Biol.

The complex IV inhibition threshold in in situ mitochondria was found to be in the range of 50–65%. The complex IV threshold level was determined to be ∼70% in synaptic mitochondria (11Davey G.P. Peuchen S. Clark J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12753-12757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) and ∼60% in nonsynaptic mitochondria (12Davey G.P. Clark J.B. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1617-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), implying that complex IV possesses similar levels of control of oxygen consumption rates in in situ mitochondria as in isolated rat brain mitochondria. In vivo metabolic control analysis studies, performed on HepG2 cells, showed that complex IV had a lower threshold (∼49%) in the absence of oligomycin (state 3 respiration), compared with a threshold of ∼75% in the presence of oligomycin (state 4 respiration) (21Piccoli C. Scrima R. Boffoli D. Capitanio N. Biochem. J. 2006; 396: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Studies have shown that in situ synaptosomal mitochondria respire at a rate between state 3 and state 4, with the initial rate being closer to state 4 (29Scott I.D. Nicholls D.G. Biochem. J. 1980; 186: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Therefore, the synaptosomal model is more comparable with the HepG2 cells in the presence of oligomycin. In accordance with the results reported here, complex I possessed the highest level of control of the ETC complexes in isolated rat brain synaptic mitochondria (11Davey G.P. Peuchen S. Clark J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12753-12757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). The FCCs for complex II/III (0.20 ± 0.03) and complex III (0.20 ± 0.05) in synaptosomal mitochondria are more compatible with the FCC for complex III from synaptic mitochondria (0.20) than the FCC from nonsynaptic mitochondria (0.15). The FCC for complex IV in synaptosomes was 0.08 ± 0.02, implying that the level of control possessed by complex IV in in situ mitochondria was lower than that possessed by complex IV in both synaptic and nonsynaptic mitochondria, with FCCs of 0.13 and 0.24, respectively. Discrepancies between the results for isolated mitochondria and those reported here may be partly accounted for by the observation that isolated mitochondria were provided with a model, such as glutamate and malate or succinate, and the FCCs and inhibition threshold levels were determined with the mitochondria in state 3. This is different from the synaptosomal situation, which involves the generation of endogenous substrates for mitochondria from glucose through the processes of glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. According to the theory of metabolic control analysis, the sum total of the FCCs of the processes involved in oxidative phosphorylation is equal to 1. Aside from the respiratory chain complexes, other processes that exert control over oxidative phosphorylation are proton leak, phosphate carrier, pyruvate carrier, ATP synthase, adenine nucleotide carrier, glycolysis, and citric acid cycle. It is suggested from our results that the ETC complexes exert a high level of control over oxidative phosphorylation, considering that the FCCs for the ETC complexes account for 0.58 ± 0.12 of the total value. To conclude, it is evident from the results obtained here that complex I exerted the greatest level of control of the respiratory chain complexes over oxygen consumption in in situ mitochondria. Lower inhibition thresholds for complex I, complex II/III, complex III, and complex IV imply that they are more tightly controlled in in situ mitochondria than in the isolated mitochondrial studies. The FCC values for the ETC complexes in synaptosomes show a similar pattern of control over the process of oxygen consumption when compared with that in isolated synaptic mitochondria.

https://openalex.org/W2003655375,"Glycoside hydrolase family 55 consists of beta-1,3-glucanases mainly from filamentous fungi. A beta-1,3-glucanase (Lam55A) from the Basidiomycete Phanerochaete chrysosporium hydrolyzes beta-1,3-glucans in the exo-mode with inversion of anomeric configuration and produces gentiobiose in addition to glucose from beta-1,3/1,6-glucans. Here we report the crystal structure of Lam55A, establishing the three-dimensional structure of a member of glycoside hydrolase 55 for the first time. Lam55A has two beta-helical domains in a single polypeptide chain. These two domains are separated by a long linker region but are positioned side by side, and the overall structure resembles a rib cage. In the complex, a gluconolactone molecule is bound at the bottom of a pocket between the two beta-helical domains. Based on the position of the gluconolactone molecule, Glu-633 appears to be the catalytic acid, whereas the catalytic base residue could not be identified. The substrate binding pocket appears to be able to accept a gentiobiose unit near the cleavage site, and a long cleft runs from the pocket, in accordance with the activity of this enzyme toward various beta-1,3-glucan oligosaccharides. In conclusion, we provide important features of the substrate-binding site at the interface of the two beta-helical domains, demonstrating an unexpected variety of carbohydrate binding modes."

Here, we report that the proteome of the egg coat in the solitary ascidian <i>Ciona intestinalis</i>, called vitelline coat (VC) fraction, contains more than 800 proteins identified by mass spectrometry-based analyses. Over 100 proteins were enriched in the VC fraction compared with the VC-free egg proteome. The most abundant component in the VC was an apolipoprotein-like protein. The VC contained multiple homologs of mammalian zona pellucida (ZP) proteins, the number of which was unexpectedly large and most of which possessed epidermal growth factor-like repeats. Furthermore, the present study revealed that two fibrinogen-like proteins, v-Themis-A and -B, both of which are expressed in the VC, are the molecules responsible for the two self-sterility loci that were identified by our previous genetic study in this species."

In these contexts, annexin 2 has the capacity to bind the negatively charged lipid components of the vesicles while also potentially regulating the actin-based structures that promote vesicle formation, budding, and transport.

Phosphorylation of annexin 2 by v-Src was shown to completely inhibit this activity (21Hubaishy I. Jones P.G. Bjorge J. Bellagamba C. Fitzpatrick S. Fujita D.J. Waisman D. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14527-14534Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), suggesting that v-Src or c-Src could play a role in regulating annexin-actin interactions in vivo. Such a role for annexin 2 would be consistent with some of the downstream consequences of v-Src activation, which include remodeling of the cytoskeleton, extensive cellular ruffling, stress-fiber breakdown, and ultimately, focal adhesion turnover (22Boschek C.B.

Consistent with previous reports, we observed that annexin 2 becomes phosphorylated when v-Src is active (3Saris C.J. Tack B.F. Kristensen T. Glenney Jr., J.R. Hunter T. Cell. 1986; 46: 201-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 33de Graauw M. Tijdens I. Smeets M.B. Hensbergen P.J. Deelder A.M. van de Water B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1029-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that cells lacking annexin 2 fail to undergo the phenotypic changes and anchorage-independent growth that characterize transformation and show that phosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine 576 is defective. We also show that the targeting of activated Src to the plasma membrane and its subsequent internalization and sorting onto Rab11-positive endosomes are compromised. Thus, our data reveal a major role for phosphorylated annexin 2 as a downstream effector of Src, inducing dynamic restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton, and also show that it has an essential upstream activity, regulating Src targeting and subsequent recycling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Antibodies-Rat-1 fibroblasts containing the L29A temperature-sensitive, constitutively active mutant of v-Src were a kind gift from Margaret Frame. MIO cells are a spontaneously immortalized human Müller (retinal glial) cell line described elsewhere (12Hayes M.J. Shao D. Bailly M. Moss S.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1816-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The anti-annexin 2 monoclonal antibody HH7 was a kind gift from Volker Gerke, and the antibody to total Src was a kind gift from Michael Way. Anti-FAK antibodies came from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and FAK-pY576, FAK-pY925, Src family-pY416, and paxillin-pY118 came from BIOSOURCE. Alexa Fluor-conjugated phalloidins were obtained from Molecular Probes.Indirect Immunofluorescence-Cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min, washed twice with PBS, and then stained with primary antibodies in PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100 overnight at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times for 10 min with PBS and then incubated with secondary antibodies and/or Alexa Fluor-conjugated phalloidin (to observe the F-actin cytoskeleton) for 45 min at 37 °C. They were then washed a further three times and mounted in VECTASHIELD. Images were collected on a Leica SP2 AOBS confocal microscope.Annexin 2 Depletion with siRNA-Annexin 2-specific siRNA oligonucleotides (target sequence AAGTGCCTATGGGTCAA) were obtained from Qiagen. R1LA29 cells were plated on Matek dishes or in 24-well plates in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum overnight to provide a 40% confluent population. Complexes were made according to the manufacturer's instructions in Opti-MEM. Cells were transfected for 2 days and then treated with a second dose of siRNA complexes for a further 2 days. In most experiments, an siRNA duplex designed against green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as a control. In the experiments in which the cells were subsequently to be transiently transfected with GFP constructs, an siRNA duplex designed against human annexin 11 (which had been shown not to work in these cells) was used as a control. The efficiency of protein depletion was assessed by Western blotting.Rescue of Knockdown Phenotype Using hdanx2-GFP-Cells were depleted of annexin 2 for 3 days as described above and then were transiently transfected with either a GFP empty vector (Clontech) or a vector encoding GFP fused to the C terminus of annexin 2 (referred to as hdanx2-GFP) into which three silent mutations had been introduced (12Hayes M.J. Shao D. Bailly M. Moss S.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1816-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These variations from the normal sequence render transcripts from the construct resistant to hybridization with the siRNA complexes and are therefore not subject to degradation. Cells were left for a further 2 days in the presence of siRNA to allow endogenous annexin 2 to be robustly depleted in siRNA-transfected cells and to give the introduced hdanx2-GFP construct time to be expressed. After the first 24 h, some cells were placed at 35 °C to activate v-Src. Cells were then fixed and stained for F-actin with Cy5-phalloidin and Src-pY416 (to allow identification of the knockdown phenotype) and were imaged by confocal microscopy. Green cells expressing either hdanx2-GFP or GFP alone were counted and scored as being either transformed or untransformed. At least 300 GFP- or hdanx2-GFP-expressing cells were analyzed on three separate plates in three independent experiments.Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting-1 × 108 R1LA29 cells were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped off the flask with a rubber policeman, and resuspended in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4). They were passaged 10 times though a 22-gauge needle and then spun on a microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was carefully removed so as not to disturb the pellet and was spun again for a further 10 min. 400 μl of supernatant was then incubated for 90 min at 4 °C with 8 μg of the anti-annexin 2 monoclonal antibody or total mouse IgG control (Caltag Laboratories) and 35 μl of 50% Protein G-Sepharose 4B (Sigma). The samples were washed four times with 1.5 ml of lysis buffer and once with 1.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). Following SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, tyrosine-phosphorylated annexin 2 was identified using the pTyr-100 monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling).Anchorage-independent Growth-Cells were initially depleted of annexin 2 for 3 days with siRNA or treated with a GFP-specific control siRNA. They were then grown in soft agarose (0.4% agarose matrix in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 5% fetal bovine serum on a lower layer of 0.6% agarose in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 5% fetal bovine serum) at 41 or 35 °C for the final 48 h to activate v-Src and to allow colonies to form. Colonies were observed by low power phase microscopy and were classified according to how many cells were present in each clump of cells. The data were calculated from the mean of three plates.Statistical Methods-Student's t test was carried out to test the significance of all quantified observations. Two-tailed tests were carried out assuming that control and test samples were of equal variance.RESULTSRedistribution of Annexin 2, v-Src, and FAK-pY576 during Transformation-To test the hypothesis that a functional relationship may exist between annexin 2, Src, and FAK, we used the well characterized Rat-1 embryonic fibroblast model of v-Src transformation that expresses the thermoactivatable LA29 mutant of Src (R1LA29 cells). In agreement with other studies, we found that when cells were cultured at 41 °C (the nonpermissive temperature), the F-actin cytoskeleton appeared to be predominantly organized into basal stress fibers, with the cells flattened and apparently contact-inhibited (27Frame M.C. Fincham V.J. Carragher N.O. Wyke J.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Annexin 2 is distributed throughout the cytoplasm in such cells but is excluded from the nucleus, and there is little detectable staining of Src-pY416 (Fig. 1A). Phosphorylation of Src at tyrosine 416 (Src-pY416) stabilizes the protein in an open conformation (25Frame M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 114-130PubMed Google Scholar) and is indicative of its activity. Over a 48-h time course following a switch to the permissive temperature (35 °C), annexin 2 became enriched at the cell cortex, and Src-pY416 was observed at the focal adhesions (not visible in Fig. 1, which shows a confocal section through the middle of the cell, but clear in Fig. 3A) and then also the plasma membrane. Transformation was also accompanied by dramatic rearrangement of the F-actin cytoskeleton and a change in cell shape. Thus, cells switched from a flattened, stress fiber-dominated phenotype to become rounder, elongated, or fusiform with cortical F-actin. Western blot analysis revealed rapid appearance of Src-pY416, FAK-pY925, and paxillin-pY118 at 1 h (Fig. 1B). Phosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine 576 (in the kinase domain activation loop) appeared somewhat later. In some experiments, we observed an apparent biphasic peak of phosphorylation of Src and FAK-pY925 (as shown in these blots), but this was not seen consistently. We did not observe tyrosine phosphorylation of annexin 2 in cells at 41 °C, but after 4 h at 35 °C, it became detectable and was strongly phosphorylated by 18 h (Fig. 1C). These findings are consistent with published reports of annexin 2 tyrosine phosphorylation by the temperature-sensitive NY68 Src mutant (35Garber E.A. Krueger J.G. Hanafusa H. Goldberg A.R. Virology. 1983; 126: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 36Yamaoka K. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Fukuda H. Akita Y. Kurosawa K. Yamamoto Y. Sanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 345: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the relocalization of annexin 2 to the cortex is evident even after 1 h at the permissive temperature (see example in Fig. 3), suggesting that annexin 2 translocates before it becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated. By 48 h, many of the cells showed marked enrichment of Src-pY416 and annexin 2 in the cortex, in ruffles, on large macropinosomes, and on perinuclear vesicles (Fig. 1A, inset). When we examined R1LA29 cells transiently transfected with a GFP fusion of the temperature-sensitive LA29 Src mutant, we observed migration of v-Src-GFP from what appeared to be focal adhesions (short, linear, and basal structures at the periphery of the cell) to large macropinosomes when they were grown at the permissive temperature (supplemental Fig. 1 and movie). The protein appeared to spool off the focal adhesion onto the nascent macropinosome. Similar results were observed for c-Src-GFP (data not shown).FIGURE 3Relocalization of FAK-pY576 in response to v-Src-mediated cell transformation is dependent upon annexin 2. R1LA29 cells were partially depleted of annexin 2 as described in the legend to Fig. 5, fixed, and immunostained for annexin 2 (anx 2), FAK-pY576, and F-actin in both the untransformed and transformed states. Following the switch from restrictive to permissive temperature for 1 h, annexin 2-depleted cells (pink arrowheads) remained large and flat with numerous focal adhesions enriched in FAK-pY576. In contrast, annexin 2-positive cells acquired a transformed phenotype in which annexin 2 relocalized to the cell cortex. By 8 h, there was a dramatic increase in the cellular content of FAK-pY576 in annexin 2-positive cells, in which it relocalized to the annexin 2-rich cortex and to the perinuclear annexin 2-rich and actin-rich vesicles (white arrowheads). Relocalization of FAK-pY576 did not occur in annexin 2-depleted cells.

Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2177-2185Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), we were able to partially phenocopy cellular transformation by overexpression of an annexin 2Y23E-GFP (phosphomimetic) fusion protein. Cells overexpressing this construct showed varying degrees of actin remodeling, including the restructuring of stress fibers, cellular ruffling, and macropinosome formation (data not shown). Taken together, these observations support the notion that annexin 2, when phosphorylated by v-Src on tyrosine 23, is an important effector of actin remodeling.Annexin 2 Is Required for Plasma Membrane Targeting of v-Src-To determine whether annexin 2 is required for the relocalization of temperature-sensitive v-Src, we used siRNA to deplete R1LA29 cells of annexin 2 prior to switching the cells to the permissive temperature. At the restrictive temperature, annexin 2-depleted cells were not morphologically different from wild-type cells, and there was no obvious difference in the staining intensity or localization of active Src, F-actin, or FAK-pY576 (Figs. 2A and 3). At the permissive temperature, however, cells lacking annexin 2 failed to exhibit the relocalization of active Src, FAK-pY576, paxillin-pY118, and actin to the perinuclear endosomal compartment, membrane ruffles, or macropinosomes, and the morphological changes associated with transformation did not occur. The cells remained large and flat with abundant stress fibers. Cells depleted of annexin 2 still contained active Src, as observed on Western blotting (Fig. 2B), but this was almost entirely localized at focal adhesions (see white arrowheads at the 24-h time point in Fig. 2A). Fig. 2 (C and D) shows histograms representing the proportion of Src phosphorylation on tyrosine 416 observed at various time points and the efficiency of annexin 2 knockdown achieved at each time point. There was no statistically significant difference in the kinetics of v-Src phosphorylation (believed to be an auto-catalytic event) between control and annexin 2-depleted cells, suggesting that v-Src activation alone is insufficient to elicit the morphological changes associated with transformation.FIGURE 2Membrane targeting of activated Src requires annexin 2. A, R1LA29 cells were depleted of annexin 2 by siRNA treatment for 4 days at 41 °C. Cultures were then moved to 35 °C for the times indicated prior to fixation and immunostaining for annexin 2 (anx 2), Src-pY416, and F-actin. The top panel shows confocal sections at the base of cells grown at 41 °C, with both annexin 2-positive and annexin 2-negative cells in the field of view. Annexin 2 is present throughout the cytoplasm, the actin cytoskeleton is dominated by stress fibers, and Src-pY416 is undetectable. After 4 h at 35 °C, annexin 2, actin, and Src-pY416 appear at the actin-rich cortex and in a perinuclear vesicular domain (pink arrowheads), whereas there is no appearance of Src-pY416 at these sites and no change in cell shape in annexin 2-depleted cells. After 24 h, Src-pY416 is clearly enriched at the focal adhesions (white arrowheads) in annexin 2-depleted cells, but there is no morphological transformation. Insets show diagrammatic representations of the confocal plane. Scale bars, 25 μm. B, whole cell extracts were prepared from R1LA29 cells following a 4-day culture at 41 °C in the presence of control or annexin 2 siRNA and from cells that had been switched to the permissive temperature for the times indicated and immunoblotted as described in the legend to Fig. 1B. The right panel shows extracts from the control siRNA-treated cells at the restrictive temperature and after 36 h at the permissive temperature. There is an increase in phosphorylation of Src on phospho-Tyr416 and of paxillin on phospho-Tyr118, but phosphorylation on FAK at phospho-Tyr576 is impaired. C, densitometric analysis of Src-pY416 Western blots in control and annexin 2-depleted cells shows that the band intensity, indicative of Src activation, increases in a similar manner under both experimental conditions. KD, knockdown. D, a densitometric analysis shows that annexin 2 levels are maintained at least 50% below the control (Ctrl; when normalized to tubulin) for the duration of the experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Phosphorylation of FAK on tyrosine 576 was visualized by immunostaining both control and annexin 2-depleted cells (Fig. 3). Levels of FAK-pY576 were almost undetectable by Western blot analysis following siRNA treatment for annexin 2 (Fig. 2B), whereas total FAK in the cells remained constant (data not shown). In annexin 2-depleted cells, FAK-pY576 remained tightly associated with the focal adhesions (Fig. 3, pink arrowheads), whereas in annexin 2-positive cells, FAK-pY576 levels increased, and the protein relocated, together with annexin 2, to the cortex and to perinuclear vesicles (white arrowheads). The kinetics of phosphorylation of other potential targets of activated Src such as paxillin-pY118 and FAK-pY925 (data not shown) were not affected by the depletion of annexin 2 (Fig. 2B).We also investigated annexin 2 involvement in the activation of endogenous c-Src by performing siRNA experiments to deplete annexin 2 in MIO cells, an untransformed, spontaneously motile glial cell line described in previous studies (12Hayes M.J. Shao D. Bailly M. Moss S.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1816-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In these cells, Src-pY416 is normally enriched at dynamic ruffles and at the cell cortex, whereas in cells depleted of annexin 2, Src-pY416 was mislocalized to the ends of F-actin stress fibers (supplemental Fig. 2). We showed previously that the abundant F-actin stress fibers in annexin 2-depleted MIO cells are tethered at focal adhesions (12Hayes M.J. Shao D. Bailly M. Moss S.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1816-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); thus, annexin 2 depletion in both MIO and R1LA29 cells results in the accumulation of active Src at focal adhesions.To confirm that the resistance of annexin 2-depleted cells to transformation by Src was a direct result of the loss of annexin 2 and not due to some other epiphenomenon, we performed a “reversal of phenotype” experiment in which an siRNA-resistant “hardened” annexin 2-GFP fusion protein (hdanx2-GFP) was expressed in knockdown R1LA29 cells (12Hayes M.J. Shao D. Bailly M. Moss S.E. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1816-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The proportion of cells that appeared to be flat and untransformed (by examination of the actin phenotype, cell shape, and localization of active Src to the plasma membrane) was established at both the permissive and nonpermissive temperatures. As expected, a higher proportion of cells remained morphologically untransformed when annexin 2 was depleted. However, more of these cells subsequently adopted a transformed phenotype when the hdanx2-GFP construct was expressed compared with those transformed with GFP alone, indicating that ectopic overexpression of annexin 2 can indeed compensate for loss of the endogenous protein (supplemental Fig. 3).Targeting of Annexin 2 and Src to Rab11-positive Vesicles-In cells in which v-Src is fully active, we observed relocalization of annexin 2, Src-pY416, FAK-pY576, FAK-pY925, paxillin-pY118, PAK1 (data not shown), and F-actin not only to dynamic actin-rich ruffles at the cell cortex but also to cytoplasmic and perinuclear vesicles (Fig. 4, A and D). A subset of the annexin 2-positive vesicles, most notably those at the perinuclear compartment, also labeled positively for the recycling endosomal marker Rab11 (Fig. 4B, pink arrowheads). To confirm this result and to examine the role of annexin 2 in the formation of this endosomal compartment, cells were transiently transfected with Rab11-GFP (Fig. 4C). At the nonpermissive temperature and despite forced expression, Rab11-GFP was very faint in all cells, exhibiting some perinuclear enrichment with vesicles throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, following a period of growth at the permissive temperature, Rab11-GFP-positive vesicles formed a more prominent perinuclear aggregation, in addition to a marked increase in Rab11-GFP at the plasma membrane. The Rab11-GFP-positive perinuclear compartment also stained for annexin 2 (Fig. 4C), which, taken"
https://openalex.org/W2113294504,"ErbB4, a type I transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase, is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family. Its cleavage releases an intracellular C-terminal domain (ICD), which can be either degraded following ubiqitination or translocated to the nucleus and regulate gene expression. There are 2 ErbB4 ICD isoforms: CYT-1 and CYT-2. We and others have previously reported that following cleavage, CYT-2 selectively translocates to the nucleus. In the current study we found that following cleavage, the intracellular levels of CYT-1 ICD decreased rapidly, while levels of CYT-2 ICD remained relatively stable. CYT-1 ICD degradation could be prevented by administration of either the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin or the lysosome inhibitor chloroquine, indicating both proteasomal and lysosomal degradation. Further studies implicated Nedd4, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a mediator of CYT-1 ubiquitination and degradation. The interaction of Nedd4 with CYT-1 was shown by coimmnunoprecipitation, an in vitro direct binding assay, and an in vitro ubiquitination assay. Three PPxY or PY motifs present in the CYT-1 C terminus are necessary for binding by Nedd4 WW domains, because impaired interactions are seen in mutation of any of the PY motifs. Nedd4-CYT-1 binding was associated with increased CYT-1 ubiquitination following proteasome inhibitor treatment. Impaired Nedd4 binding to CYT-1 by PY motif mutations led to increased CYT-1 ICD stability, whereas only one of the PY motif mutations (Y1056A), which disrupts the binding sites for both a WW domain and an SH2 domain of PI3 kinase, demonstrated enhanced nuclear translocation following HB-EGF treatment. These studies indicate that Nedd4 mediates ErbB4 CYT-1 ICD ubiquitination and degradation, and the prevention of both WW binding and PI3 kinase activity are required for ErbB4 nuclear translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2059485989,"Common features of the extracellular carbohydrate-active virulence factors involved in host-pathogen interactions are their large sizes and modular complexities. This has made them recalcitrant to structural analysis, and therefore our understanding of the significance of modularity in these important proteins is lagging. Clostridium perfringens is a prevalent human pathogen that harbors a wide array of large, extracellular carbohydrate-active enzymes and is an excellent and relevant model system to approach this problem. Here we describe the complete structure of C. perfringens GH84C (NagJ), a 1001-amino acid multimodular homolog of the C. perfringens micro-toxin, which was determined using a combination of small angle x-ray scattering and x-ray crystallography. The resulting structure reveals unprecedented insight into how catalysis, carbohydrate-specific adherence, and the formation of molecular complexes with other enzymes via an ultra-tight protein-protein interaction are spatially coordinated in an enzyme involved in a host-pathogen interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2023387505,"GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, is synthesized by glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). GAD exists in two adult isoforms, GAD65 and GAD67. During embryonic brain development at least two additional transcripts exist, I-80 and I-86, which are distinguished by insertions of 80 or 86 bp into GAD67 mRNA, respectively. Though it was described that embryonic GAD67 transcripts are not detectable during adulthood there are evidences suggesting re-expression under certain pathological conditions in the adult brain. In the present study we systematically analyzed for the first time the spatiotemporal distribution of different GADs with emphasis on embryonic GAD67 mRNAs in the postnatal brain using highly sensitive methods.QPCR was used to precisely investigate the postnatal expression level of GAD related mRNAs in cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and olfactory bulb of rats from P1 throughout adulthood. Within the first three postnatal weeks the expression of both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNAs reached adult levels in hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum. The olfactory bulb showed by far the highest expression of GAD65 as well as GAD67 transcripts. Embryonic GAD67 splice variants were still detectable at birth. They continuously declined to barely detectable levels during postnatal development in all investigated regions with exception of a comparatively high expression in the olfactory bulb. Radioactive in situ hybridizations confirmed the occurrence of embryonic GAD67 transcripts in the olfactory bulb and furthermore detected their localization mainly in the subventricular zone and the rostral migratory stream.Embryonic GAD67 transcripts can hardly be detected in the adult brain, except for specific regions associated with neurogenesis and high synaptic plasticity. Therefore a functional role in processes like proliferation, migration or synaptogenesis is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W1963794591,"CO dehydrogenase from the Gram-negative chemolithoautotrophic eubacterium Oligotropha carboxidovorans OM5 is a structurally characterized molybdenum-containing iron-sulfur flavoenzyme, which catalyzes the oxidation of CO (CO + H(2)O --> CO(2) + 2e(-) + 2H(+)). It accommodates in its active site a unique bimetallic [CuSMoO(2)] cluster, which is subject to post-translational maturation. Insertional mutagenesis of coxD has established its requirement for the assembly of the [CuSMoO(2)] cluster. Disruption of coxD led to a phenotype of the corresponding mutant OM5 D::km with the following characteristics: (i) It was impaired in the utilization of CO, whereas the utilization of H(2) plus CO(2) was not affected; (ii) Under appropriate induction conditions bacteria synthesized a fully assembled apo-CO dehydrogenase, which could not oxidize CO; (iii) Apo-CO dehydrogenase contained a [MoO(3)] site in place of the [CuSMoO(2)] cluster; and (iv) Employing sodium sulfide first and then the Cu(I)-(thiourea)(3) complex, the non-catalytic [MoO(3)] site could be reconstituted in vitro to a [CuSMoO(2)] cluster capable of oxidizing CO. Sequence information suggests that CoxD is a MoxR-like AAA+ ATPase chaperone related to the hexameric, ring-shaped BchI component of Mg(2+)-chelatases. Recombinant CoxD, which appeared in Escherichia coli in inclusion bodies, occurs exclusively in cytoplasmic membranes of O. carboxidovorans grown in the presence of CO, and its occurrence coincided with GTPase activity upon sucrose density gradient centrifugation of cell extracts. The presumed function of CoxD is the partial unfolding of apo-CO dehydrogenase to assist in the stepwise introduction of sulfur and copper in the [MoO(3)] center of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W2016129775,"Acetyl-CoA carboxylases ACC1 and ACC2 catalyze the carboxylation of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, regulating fatty-acid synthesis and oxidation, and are potential targets for treatment of metabolic syndrome. Expression of ACC1 in rodent lipogenic tissues and ACC2 in rodent oxidative tissues, coupled with the predicted localization of ACC2 to the mitochondrial membrane, have suggested separate functional roles for ACC1 in lipogenesis and ACC2 in fatty acid oxidation. We find, however, that human adipose tissue, unlike rodent adipose, expresses more ACC2 mRNA relative to the oxidative tissues muscle and heart. Human adipose, along with human liver, expresses more ACC2 than ACC1. Using RT-PCR, real-time PCR, and immunoprecipitation we report a novel isoform of ACC2 (ACC2.v2) that is expressed at significant levels in human adipose. The protein generated by this isoform has enzymatic activity, is endogenously expressed in adipose, and lacks the N-terminal sequence. Both ACC2 isoforms are capable of de novo lipogenesis, suggesting that ACC2, in addition to ACC1, may play a role in lipogenesis. The results demonstrate a significant difference in ACC expression between human and rodents, which may introduce difficulties for the use of rodent models for development of ACC inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2049407608,"The cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP, also called catabolite gene activator protein or CAP) plays a key role in metabolic regulation in bacteria and has become a widely studied model allosteric transcription factor. On binding its effector cAMP in the N-terminal domain, CRP undergoes a structural transition to a conformation capable of specific DNA binding in the C-terminal domain and transcription initiation. The crystal structures of Escherichia coli CRP (EcCRP) in the cAMP-bound state, both with and without DNA, are known, although its structure in the off state (cAMP-free, apoCRP) remains unknown. We describe the crystal structure at 2.0A resolution of the cAMP-free CRP homodimer from Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)R(v) (MtbCRP), whose sequence is 30% identical with EcCRP, as the first reported structure of an off-state CRP. The overall structure is similar to that seen for the cAMP-bound EcCRP, but the apo MtbCRP homodimer displays a unique level of asymmetry, with a root mean square deviation of 3.5A between all Calpha positions in the two subunits. Unlike structures of on-state EcCRP and other homologs in which the C-domains are asymmetrically positioned but possess the same internal conformation, the two C-domains of apo MtbCRP differ both in hinge structure and in internal arrangement, with numerous residues that have completely different local environments and hydrogen bond interactions, especially in the hinge and DNA-binding regions. Comparison of the structures of apo MtbCRP and DNA-bound EcCRP shows how DNA binding would be inhibited in the absence of cAMP and supports a mechanism involving functional asymmetry in apoCRP."
https://openalex.org/W2082162627,"Endosialidases (endoNs), as identified so far, are tailspike proteins of bacteriophages that specifically bind and degrade the alpha2,8-linked polysialic acid (polySia) capsules of their hosts. The crystal structure solved for the catalytic domain of endoN from coliphage K1F (endoNF) revealed a functional trimer. Folding of the catalytic trimer is mediated by an intramolecular C-terminal chaperone domain. Release of the chaperone from the folded protein confers kinetic stability to endoNF. In mutant c(S), the replacement of serine 911 by alanine prevents proteolysis and generates an enzyme that varies in activity from wild type. Using soluble polySia as substrate a 3-times higher activity was detected while evaluation with immobilized polySia revealed a 190-fold reduced activity. Importantly, activity of c(S) did not differ from wild type with tetrameric sialic acid, the minimal endoNF substrate. Furthermore, we show that the presence of the chaperone domain in c(S) destabilizes binding to polySia in a similar way as did selective disruption of a polySia binding site in the stalk domain. The improved catalytic efficiency toward soluble polySia observed in these mutants can be explained by higher dissociation and association probabilities, whereas inversely, an impaired processivity was found. The fact that endoNF is a processive enzyme introduces a new molecular basis to explain capsule degradation by bacteriophages, which until now has been regarded as a result of cooperative interaction of tailspike proteins. Moreover, knowing that release of the chaperone domain confers kinetic stability and processivity, conservation of the proteolytic process can be explained by its importance in phage evolution."

The crystal structures of YesW in complex with rhamnose and ligand-free YesX were determined at 1.32 and 1.65 A resolution, respectively. The YesW amino acid residues such as Asn(152), Asp(172), Asn(532), Gly(533), Thr(534), and Tyr(595) in the active cleft bind to rhamnose molecules through hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. Other rhamnose molecules are accommodated at the noncatalytic domain far from the active cleft, revealing that the domain possibly functions as a novel carbohydrate-binding module. A structural comparison between YesW and YesX indicates that a specific loop in YesX for recognizing the terminal saccharide molecule sterically inhibits penetration of the polymer over the active cleft. The loop-deficient YesX mutant exhibits YesW-like endotype activity, demonstrating that molecular conversion regarding the mode of action is achieved by the addition/removal of the loop for recognizing the terminal saccharide. This is the first report on a structural insight into RG-I recognition and molecular conversion of exotype to endotype in polysaccharide lyases."
https://openalex.org/W1999269655,"The Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) genes bmp2 and bmp4 are expressed in highly conserved patterns in the developing vertebrate inner ear. It has, however, proved difficult to elucidate the function of BMPs during ear development as mutations in these genes cause early embryonic lethality. Previous studies using conditional approaches in mouse and chicken have shown that Bmp4 has a role in semicircular canal and crista development, but there is currently no direct evidence for the role of Bmp2 in the developing inner ear.We have used an RNA rescue strategy to test the role of bmp2b in the zebrafish inner ear directly. Injection of bmp2b or smad5 mRNA into homozygous mutant swirl (bmp2b(-/-)) embryos rescues the early patterning defects in these mutants and the fish survive to adulthood. As injected RNA will only last, at most, for the first few days of embryogenesis, all later development occurs in the absence of bmp2b function. Although rescued swirl adult fish are viable, they have balance defects suggestive of vestibular dysfunction. Analysis of the inner ears of these fish reveals a total absence of semicircular canal ducts, structures involved in the detection of angular motion. All other regions of the ear, including the ampullae and cristae, are present and appear normal. Early stages of otic development in rescued swirl embryos are also normal.Our findings demonstrate a critical late role for bmp2b in the morphogenesis of semicircular canals in the zebrafish inner ear. This is the first demonstration of a developmental role for any gene during post-embryonic stages of otic morphogenesis in the zebrafish. Despite differences in the early stages of semicircular canal formation between zebrafish and amniotes, the role of Bmp2 in semicircular canal duct outgrowth is likely to be conserved between different vertebrate species."
https://openalex.org/W2091517584,"Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) is a cardiogenic and cardiohypertrophic growth factor. ProHB-EGF, a product of the Hb-egf gene and the precursor of HB-EGF, is anchored to the plasma membrane. Its ectodomain region is shed by a disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs) when activated by various stimulations. It has been reported that an uncleavable mutant of Hb-egf, uc-Hb-egf, produces uc-proHB-EGF, which is not cleaved by ADAMs and causes dilation of the heart in knock-in mice. This suggests that the shedding of proHB-EGF is essential for the development and survival of cardiomyocytes: however, the molecular mechanism involved has remained unclear. In this study, we investigated the relationship between uc-proHB-EGF expression and cardiomyocyte survival. Human uc-proHB-EGF was adenovirally introduced into the rat cardiomyoblast cell line H9c2, and the cells were cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Uc-proHB-EGF-expressing H9c2 cells underwent apoptosis under normoxic conditions, which distinctly increased under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, we observed an increased Caspase-3 activity, reactive oxygen species accumulation, and an increased c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity in the uc-proHB-EGF-expressing H9c2 cells. Treatment of the uc-proHB-EGF transfectants with inhibitors of Caspase-3, reactive oxygen species, and JNK, namely, Z-VAD-fmk, N-acetylcysteine, and SP600125, respectively, significantly reduced hypoxic cell death. These data indicate that insufficiency of proHB-EGF shedding under hypoxic stress leads to cardiomyocyte apoptosis via Caspase-3- and JNK-dependent pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2111677295,"Homologous pairing, an essential process for homologous recombination, is the formation of a heteroduplex joint by an invading single-stranded DNA tail and a complementary sequence within double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The base rotation of the parental dsDNA, to switch from parental base pairs to heteroduplex ones with the invading single-stranded DNA, sterically requires vertical extension between adjacent base pairs, which inevitably induces untwisting of the dsDNA. RecA is a prototype of the RecA/Rad51/Dmc1 family proteins, which promote ATP-dependent homologous pairing in homologous DNA recombination in vivo, except in mitochondria. As predicted by the requirement for the untwisting, dsDNA bound to RecA is extended and untwisted, and homologous pairing by RecA in vitro is extensively stimulated by the negative supercoils of dsDNA substrates. D-loop formation in negatively supercoiled dsDNA, which serves as an assay for homologous pairing, is also catalyzed in an ATP-independent manner by proteins structurally unrelated to RecA, such as Mhr1. Mhr1 is required for yeast mitochondrial DNA recombination instead of RecA family proteins. Inconsistent with the topological requirements, tests for the effects of negative supercoils revealed that Mhr1 catalyzes homologous pairing with relaxed closed circular dsDNA much more efficiently than with negatively supercoiled dsDNA. Topological analyses indicated that neither the process nor the products of homologous pairing by Mhr1 involve a net topological change of closed circular dsDNA. This would be favorable for homologous recombination in mitochondria, where dsDNA is unlikely to be under topological stress toward unwinding. We propose a novel topological mechanism wherein Mhr1 induces untwisting without net topological change.

A key intermediate step in homologous recombination is homologous pairing, in which a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) tail derived from a double-stranded break invades a homologous sequence within intact dsDNA, resulting in heteroduplex joint formation with the complementary sequence of the dsDNA by replacing a parental strand. Heteroduplex joints are formed by switching base pairs of the parental dsDNA to heteroduplex base pairs between the invading ssDNA and the complementary sequence of the dsDNA, which requires extension between adjacent base pairs of the dsDNA to provide a space for the rotation of bases for the base pair switch (5Nishinaka T. Shinohara A. Ito Y. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11071-11076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The extension of dsDNA is necessarily associated with its untwisting (6Stasiak A. DiCapua E. Koller T. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 557-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 7Stasiak A. DiCapua E. Nature. 1982; 299: 185-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), which generates positive supercoiling in the remaining region in closed circular dsDNA (cc-dsDNA; Fig. 1, from DNA 1 to DNA 2). A negatively supercoiled cc-dsDNA substrate neutralizes the positive supercoils, but a relaxed cc-dsDNA substrate accumulates the positive supercoils, which will resist the formation of heteroduplex joints. Homologous pairing activities are typically assayed in vitro by examining the formation of D-loops, using negatively supercoiled cc-dsDNA (natural cc-dsDNA, called “form I”) and homologous ssDNA oligonucleotides as substrates (8Shibata T.

Biol. 1977; 116: 783-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). A D-loop consists of a heteroduplex joint and a loop of a displaced parental strand of the dsDNA, with the associated untwisting of the parental dsDNA (9Beattie K.L. Wiegand R.C. Radding C.M. J. Mol.

Consistent with these topological requirements in homologous pairing and D-loop formation, negative supercoils were shown to be essential for uncatalyzed D-loop formation (10Holloman W.K. Wiegand R. Hoessli C. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2394-2398Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and to stimulate RecA- and Rad51-catalyzed D-loop formation extensively, as compared with the initial velocity with dsDNA without supercoils (11Shibata T.

RecA is the prototype of the RecA/Rad51/Dmc1 family proteins, which are essential to catalyze homologous pairing through an ATP-dependent reaction in homologous DNA recombination in prokaryotic genomes and eukaryotic nuclei (8Shibata T.

Cellular DNA is likely to be relaxed by the potent activities of DNA topoisomerases, but the factors required to fulfill the topological requirement for homologous pairing in vivo remain unidentified, especially in mitochondria. Homologous recombination in bacterial viruses and the mitochondria of yeasts and mammals is independent of the RecA/Rad51/Dmc1 family proteins. Instead, we found that in yeast, mtDNA recombination depends on Mhr1, a protein structurally unrelated to RecA/Rad51 (3Ling F. Morioka H. Ohtsuka E. Shibata T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 4956-4963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Ling F. Makishima F. Morishima N. Shibata T.

EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential components of the machinery that drives oxidative respiration-dependent energy production. mtDNA undergoes extensive mitotic homologous recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (20Dujon B. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 505-635Google Scholar) and humans (21Kraytsberg Y. Schwartz M. Brown T.A. Ebralidse K. Kunz W.S. Clayton D.A. Vissing J. Khrapko K. Science. 2004; 304: 981Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 22Zsurka G. Hampel K.G. Kudina T. Kornblum C. Kraytsberg Y. Elger C.E. Khrapko K. Kunz W.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2007; 80: 298-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). In addition, Mhr1 is a critical player in the vegetative segregation of heteroalleles that leads to a genetic state in which all of the copies of mtDNA in each cell or in each individual (in the case of healthy human babies) share an identical sequence (called “homoplasmy”) (20Dujon B. Strathern J.N. Jones E.W. Broach J.R. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces: Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1981: 505-635Google Scholar). The function of Mhr1 in homoplasmy is in sharp contrast to the generally accepted roles of homologous recombination in nuclear genomes; i.e. homologous recombination, and in particular meiotic recombination, contributes to genetic diversification. Mhr1 functions in homoplasmy to initiate the rolling circle mode of mtDNA replication to form concatemers, which are selectively transmitted to daughter cells, leading to homoplasmy (19Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 23Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). RecA does not initiate this mode of DNA replication in wild type Escherichia coli cells (24Cohen A. Clark A.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 327-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to identify the differences and similarities between the homologous pairing catalyzed by the RecA/Rad51/Dmc1 family proteins and that catalyzed by Mhr1 to provide insights into the differences between the two genetic outcomes. The ATP-independent D-loop formation mediated by Mhr1 and other proteins structurally unrelated to RecA may be a type of complementary strand annealing (i.e. a two-strand reaction) through the mechanism proposed for uncatalyzed D-loop formation. This idea is based on the following observations. Negatively supercoiled dsDNA tends to melt and create ssDNA regions (9Beattie K.L. Wiegand R.C. Radding C.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 783-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and some non-RecA proteins (λ phage β protein, RecT, Rad52, and RecO) have potent activity to anneal complementary ssDNA molecules (25Muniyappa K. Radding M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7472-7478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Hall S.D. Kane M.F. Kolodner R.D. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 277-287Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Mortensen U.H. Bendixen C. Sunjevaric I. Rothstein R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1998; 95: 6049-6054Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). If this model is correct, then Mhr1 would absolutely require negative supercoiling for the apparently homologous pairing. Alternatively, the D-loop formation catalyzed by non-RecA proteins is a true homologous pairing reaction, including ssDNA invading an internal, homologous sequence in dsDNA (i.e. a three-strand reaction). This model was proposed based on structural analysis of an ssDNA oligonucleotide bound to either RecA or Rad51 in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable ATP analogue, which suggested that homologous pairing is an intrinsic function of DNA molecules rather than a specific function of proteins (5Nishinaka T. Shinohara A. Ito Y. Yokoyama S. Shibata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11071-11076Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 29Shibata T. Nishinaka T. Mikawa T. Aihara H. Kurumizaka H. Yokoyama S. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8425-8432Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, topological analyses originally aimed at testing the above alternative models revealed an unexpected feature of the Mhr1-catalyzed homologous pairing, which is prevented by negative supercoils and generates no net topological changes of dsDNA substrates during and after the reactions. This finding suggests a novel mechanism wherein Mhr1 extends and untwists dsDNA to promote homologous pairing. Purification of Mhr1-The purified Mhr1 used in this study was obtained as previously described (19Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Standard Reaction Buffer-The standard buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. DNA Substrates-The methods for the preparation of supercoiled pGsat4 and fX174 RF I (replicative form I) cc-dsDNA and ssDNA oligonucleotide (50-mer oligonucleotides) and for the 5′-end labeling of the ssDNA oligonucleotide with 32P were described previously (19Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Negatively supercoiled pUC18 plasmid DNA was prepared from pUC18 plasmid DNA-harboring E. coli XL2-blue cells (endA1 gyrA96(nalR) thi-1 recA1 relA1 lac glnV44 F′ [::Tn10 proAB+ lacIq Δ(lacZ)M15] hsdR17(rK- mK+)) (Stratagene), using an illustra plasmidPrep Mini Spin Kit (GE Healthcare). The amounts of DNA are expressed as the amounts of nucleotides, unless otherwise stated. Preparation of Relaxed cc-dsDNA-Partially or fully relaxed cc-dsDNA was prepared by treating negatively supercoiled pUC18 plasmid DNA (209 μm in nucleotides) with 0.025 units/μl or 0.1 units/μl calf thymus topoisomerase I (Takara Shuzo Co., Kyoto, Japan) in a 20-μl reaction mixture at 37 °C for 30 min. The topoisomerase I was then completely removed from the reaction solution by a phenol/chloroform extraction, and the DNA was purified with an illustra plasmidPrep Mini Spin Kit. When we analyzed the Mhr1-catalyzed formation of three-stranded structures in the presence of active topoisomerase I, which should release any topological stress during the reaction, the topoisomerase removal and DNA purification procedures were not performed. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously to analyze the relaxed cc-dsDNA (30Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Nakasu S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2705-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Standard D-loop Formation Assay-The standard reaction mixture (20.5 μl) for the assay consisted of 15.6 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 1.8 mm dithiothreitol, 88 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm MgCl2. After the 32P-labeled ssDNA oligonucleotide (1.0 μm final concentration after dsDNA was added, unless otherwise stated) was incubated with 1.95 μm (final concentration) Mhr1 in the reaction mixture (19.5 μl) for 5 min at 37 °C, 1 μl of dsDNA was added to a concentration of 15 μm, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated period of time. For the reaction with E. coli RecA, 1.3 mm ATP and MgCl2 (final concentration, 13 mm) were added together with the dsDNA. After the proteins were removed, the products (D-loops) were assayed by agarose gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to an imaging plate, which was analyzed with a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer. Details of the assay have been described previously (19Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A Restriction Endonuclease Protection Assay for Homologous Pairing-The homologous three-stranded structures, formed as a result of homologous pairing, are protected from restriction enzymes. A restriction endonuclease protection assay based on this principle was performed according to a previously described method (32Pezza R.J. Voloshin O.N. Vanevski F. Camerini-Otero R.D. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1758-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), with a slight modification. In four sets of the reaction mixture (7.0 μl), Mhr1 at various concentrations was incubated with an ssDNA oligonucleotide (1.3 μm final concentration after dsDNA was added) bearing the sequence encompassing either the NdeI site from pUC18 (NdeI ssDNA oligonucleotide, 5′-CGGCATCAGAGCAGATTGTACTGAGAGTGCACCATATGCGGTGTGAAATACCGCACAGAT-3′; in two sets) or the SspI site from pUC18 (SspI ssDNA oligonucleotide, 5′-AATGTTGAATACTCATACTCTTCCTTTTTCAATATTATTGAAGCATTTATCAGGGTTATT-3′; in two sets) in the standard reaction buffer at 37 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, to each sample containing the Mhr1-ssDNA oligonucleotide complexes (7.0 μl), 3.0 μl of supercoiled or relaxed pUC18 dsDNA or ScaI-linearized pUC18 dsDNA (to a final concentration of 41.8 μm) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. To each one from the two sets of reaction mixtures containing the same ssDNA oligonucleotide, the NdeI or SspI restriction endonuclease (1.0 unit/μl or 0.5 units/μl, respectively) was then added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow DNA cleavage. When the formation of homologous three-stranded structures by Mhr1 was analyzed in the absence of topological stress (i.e. in the presence of eukaryotic topoisomerase I, which relaxes both negative and positive supercoils), we first relaxed the samples of negatively supercoiled pUC18 cc-dsDNA (209 μm) with 0.025 units/μl or 1.0 unit/μl calf thymus topoisomerase I at 37 °C for 30 min in a 20-μl reaction mixture. After a 1.5-fold dilution of the reaction solution containing the relaxed pUC18 cc-dsDNA (final concentration, 41.8 μm) and active topoisomerase I (final concentration, 0.005 or 0.2 units/μl) by the standard reaction buffer, 3 μl of the diluted dsDNA containing the topoisomerase were added to the Mhr1-ssDNA oligonucleotide complexes (7.0 μl) and mixed, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The NdeI was then added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. After the DNA substrates were incubated with Mhr1 and then treated with a restriction enzyme, all of the proteins were removed by the addition of 1 μl of 10% SDS and 1 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K, followed by an incubation at 37 °C for 15 min. The DNA was then analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels in the presence of 0.3 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The signals from the various DNA species in the gel were quantified by a Southern blot analysis, using [32P] pUC18 DNA as a probe, after the DNA was transferred to N+ nylon membranes. The signals were analyzed with a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer (19Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Assay for the Protein-free Products of Homologous Pairing by Mhr1 in the Presence of Topoisomerase I Using cc-dsDNA Substrates-In each reaction (20 μl), negatively supercoiled cc-dsDNA (pUC18 plasmid DNA (245 μm) or φX174 RF I cc-dsDNA (172 μm)) was treated in the standard reaction buffer with 1.0 unit/μl calf thymus topoisomerase I at 37 °C for 30 min. Then 3.0 μl of relaxed cc-dsDNA (final concentration in the reaction mixture, 49.0 μm for pUC18 plasmid DNA and 34.5 μm for φX174 RF I cc-dsDNA) in standard buffer containing active topoisomerase were added to 7.0 μl of a solution containing 32P-labeled ssDNA oligonucleotide (1.3 μm calculated final concentration, assuming that all DNA was recovered during the labeling and purifying processes) and 0 or 3.9 μm (final concentration) Mhr1 in the standard reaction buffer, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.2 units/μl topoisomerase I. After the proteins were removed by adding 1 μl of 10% SDS and 1 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K at 37 °C for 20 min, the DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels (2 V/cm) for 11 h in a cold room (4 °C). The products were also assayed by two-dimensional electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels in the cold room, as described (30Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Nakasu S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2705-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to an imaging plate, which was analyzed with a Fuji BAS2000 image analyzer, as described previously (19Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Assay for the Topological Status of the Products of Homologous Pairing by Mhr1-Relaxed cc-dsDNA was prepared by incubating negatively supercoiled pUC18 plasmid DNA (209 μm) with 1.0 unit/μl calf thymus topoisomerase I at 37 °C for 30 min. To initiate Mhr1-catalyzed homologous pairing, the relaxed pUC18 cc-dsDNA and active calf thymus topoisomerase I were added to the reaction mixture (the final dsDNA concentration and the amount of the topoisomerase I were ∼41.8 μm and 0.2 units/μl, respectively) containing Mhr1-NdeI ssDNA oligonucleotide complexes, formed by the incubation of 1.3 μm NdeI-ssDNA oligonucleotides with 3.9 μm Mhr1. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. As a control, Mhr1 was omitted from the reaction. After a phenol/chloroform extraction, the DNA products were alkaline-treated (pH 13.0) to dissociate the ssDNA oligonucleotide from the cc-dsDNA, neutralized to reform the double helix, and then analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. The first and second dimensions of gel electrophoresis were both performed at 1.3 V/cm for 11 h at room temperature, but the second one was performed in the presence of 0.02 μg/ml ethidium bromide at room temperature, as described (30Kikuchi A. Asai K. Nature. 1984; 309: 677-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 31Nakasu S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 2705-2710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assay for cc-dsDNA Binding by Mhr1-In each reaction (10 μl), negatively supercoiled cc-dsDNA (pUC18 plasmid DNA, 41.8 μm in nucleotides) was mixed with Mhr1 at various concentrations (0, 0.93, and 1.9 μm) in the standard reaction buffer and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The Mhr1-cc-dsDNA complexes were then subjected to a gel shift assay, as previously described (19Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Assay for Topological Changes of cc-dsDNA Due to Mhr1 Binding-In each reaction (20 μl), negatively supercoiled cc-dsDNA (pUC18 plasmid DNA; 209 μm) was treated with 1.0 unit/μl calf thymus topoisomerase I at 37 °C for 30 min. Then the reaction mixture was diluted 1.5-fold by the standard reaction buffer, 3 μl of the diluted solution (containing relaxed cc-dsDNA, final concentration 41.8 μm) were added to 7.0 μl of a solution containing Mhr1 at various concentrations (0, 0.93, and 1.9 μm), and the solution was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 0.2 units/μl topoisomerase I. The DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels (2 V/cm) for 11 h at room temperature, after the topoisomerase I was removed by a phenol/chloroform extraction. Mhr1 Promotes D-loop Formation in Vitro from Negatively Supercoiled cc-dsDNA and Homologous ssDNA Oligonucleotides-When negatively supercoiled cc-dsDNA and homologous ssDNA oligonucleotide fragments (or ssDNA oligonucleotides) are incubated in the presence of an excess amount of an ATP-dependent homologous pairing protein (RecA or Dmc1), D-loops are quickly formed and then are actively dissociated in an ATP-hydrolysis-dependent manner. This process occurs as a part of “the D-loop cycle” (34Shibata T. Ohtani T. Iwabuchi M. Ando T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13981-13986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wu A.M. Kahn R.

Chem. 2004; 279: 35263-35272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We found that purified Mhr1 promotes D-loop formation from these substrates via a reaction that is independent of ATP (19Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Unlike the RecA/Dmc1-catalyzed reaction, in the Mhr1-catalyzed reaction, the D-loops were formed as a result of a simple time-dependent reaction (Fig. 2). D-loop formation depended on the presence of Mhr1 and the homology between the dsDNA and ssDNA oligonucleotide (Fig. 2). After the proteins were removed, the products of the Mhr1-promoted reaction were determined to be authentic D-loops, because they migrated on gels with the same velocity as that observed for D-loops formed by RecA, and they dissociated following the cleavage of the dsDNA outside the homologous region (19Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This is critical proof for D-loop formation by Mhr1, since it is well established that in the absence of a topological constraint toward untwisting (generated by negative supercoils of dsDNA substrate), D-loops spontaneously and quickly dissociate (37Radding C.M. Beattie K.L. Holloman W.K. Wiegand R.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 116: 825-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We next studied the effects of negative supercoils and topological constraints of cc-dsDNA substrates on Mhr1-catalyzed homologous pairing. Due to the characteristics described above, the D-loop formation assay is not suitable to detect the products of homologous pairing using dsDNA substrates with variable topological conditions. Therefore, we quantified the Mhr1-catalyzed homologous pairing activity using the restriction endonuclease protection assay described by Ferrin and Camerini-Otero (38Ferrin L.J. Camerini-Otero R.D. Science. 1991; 254: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) as a reliable assay for homologous pairing, to test the effects of supercoils and topological constraints. This assay is based on the principle that the three-stranded structures formed through homologous pairing of dsDNA and a ssDNA oligonucleotide by homologous DNA-pairing proteins, such as RecA, are resistant to restriction endonucleases (38Ferrin L.J. Camerini-Otero R.D. Science. 1991; 254: 1494-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To detect the formation of homologous three-stranded structures, we first used negatively supercoiled plasmid cc-dsDNA (pUC18) bearing a single NdeI cleavage site and a single SspI site as the dsDNA substrate and ssDNA oligonucleotides containing a sequence homologous to the region around the NdeI (NdeI ssDNA oligonucleotide) or SspI (SspI ssDNA oligonucleotide) cleavage site. If three-stranded structures formed as a result of homologous pairing after the incubation of the dsDNA with the NdeI or SspI ssDNA oligonucleotide and a homologous pairing protein, then the dsDNA would become resistant to NdeI or SspI, respectively, whereas it would remain sensitive to SspI or NdeI, respectively (Fig. 3A, a). The resistance was dependent on the incubation with Mhr1 and the combination of the oligonucleotide and the restriction endonuclease that recognized the restriction site within the oligonucleotide (Fig. 3B, a). For optimal protection of the dsDNA by Mhr1, the ssDNA oligonucleotide and Mhr1 had to be incubated together before the addition of dsDNA; the simultaneous addition of the ssDNA oligonucleotide and dsDNA decreased the degree of protection, whereas the incubation of the dsDNA with Mhr1 before the addition of the ssDNA oligonucleotide did not protect the dsDNA from the endonuclease (data not shown). The signals representing the protected dsDNA with a three-stranded structure became smaller when an excess amount of Mhr1 was added (Fig. 3, B (a and c) and C (a and c)). This and previous results (19Ling F. Shibata T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4730-4740Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) showed that excessive levels of the enzyme prevent Mhr1-catalyzed homologous pairing of dsDNA and the ssDNA oligonucleotide, as also observed with two other AT"
https://openalex.org/W2072507519,"To better understand the mechanism of steps in early transcription by RNA polymerase II (pol II), we investigated the molecular determinants of transcript slipping within complexes assembled on promoters containing a pre-melted transcription bubble from –9 to +3. Transcript slippage occurs when an RNA transcript contains a repetitive sequence that allows the transcript to slip back and pair with the template strand of the DNA at a new register before transcription continues. We established the contributions of individual transcription factors, DNA elements, and RNA length to slipping on a heteroduplex template using a highly purified human pol II transcription system. We found that transcripts slip at a very defined point in the transcription reaction, after pol II completes phosphodiester bond synthesis at register +5. This point is set by the position of the polymerase active site on the DNA template, as opposed to the length of the transcript, as well as by a repetitive CUCU sequence that must occur from +2 to +5. Interestingly, slipping at this juncture is induced by TATA-binding protein and transcription factor IIB and requires a TATA box but not a transcription factor IIB recognition sequence. We propose a model in which transcribing complexes, upon completing phosphodiester bond synthesis at register +5, enter one of two branches in which they either complete productive synthesis of the transcript or undergo multiple rounds of transcript slipping.

Transcription of mRNA by pol 3The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; TBP, TATA-binding protein; AdMLP, adenovirus major late promoter; nt, nucleotide; BRE, transcription factor IIB recognition sequence. II is a complex process that involves the highly regulated interplay of promoter DNA, many protein factors, and the transcript RNA itself. The promoter DNA influences the level of transcription and the position at which RNA synthesis begins through sequences in the regulatory and core promoter elements (1Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar, 2Kadonaga J.T. Cell. 2004; 116: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In addition, the conformation of promoter DNA can regulate the level of transcription, both in the presence and absence of histones (3Hieb A.R. Baran S. Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F.

The general transcription factors, including TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH, are required for pol II to transcribe in a specific fashion in most, if not all, genes (8Thomas M.C. Chiang C.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 105-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Regulated gene-specific transcription in cells requires a plethora of additional factors, including activators, repressors, co-regulators, and chromatin-modifying factors (2Kadonaga J.T.

In addition to the promoter and protein factors, biochemical studies have shown that the RNA transcript is not simply the product of the reaction, but it also stabilizes elongation complexes through the RNA: DNA hybrid and influences transformations that occur during early transcription (3Hieb A.R. Baran S. Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 10Kireeva M.L. Komissarova N. Waugh D.S. Kashlev M. J. Biol.

Biol. 2002; 22: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although the core factors required for pol II to synthesize a transcript in vitro are understood, structural and biochemical studies are still uncovering new information about the mechanism by which this process occurs and is regulated. Biochemical studies have shown that the transcription reaction is composed of a series of steps that minimally include the following: preinitiation complex formation, open complex formation, initiation, escape commitment, promoter escape, elongation, termination, and reinitiation. During preinitiation complex formation, pol II and the general transcription factors assemble at the promoter (8Thomas M.C. Chiang C.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2006; 41: 105-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Before transcription initiates, the DNA around the start site melts from approximately –9 to +3 with the help of the ATP-dependent helicase activity of TFIIH to form open complexes that contain a transcription bubble (4Holstege F.C.P. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 12Holstege F.C.P. van der Vliet P.C. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1666-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In vitro, transcription can occur in the absence of TFIIE and TFIIH from negatively supercoiled DNA (13Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 14Parvin J.D. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1993; 73: 533-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), as well as from heteroduplex templates containing mismatches from –9 to +3 that create a bubble (15Pan G. Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30101-30104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When provided with nucleotides, open complexes initiate transcription and synthesize 2–3-nt RNA transcripts, typically in an abortive fashion (13Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Cell. 1994; 77: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 16Luse D.S. Jacob G.A. J. Biol.

Initiation complexes commit to proceed forward through the reaction upon addition of the fourth nucleotide during a step termed escape commitment (11Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 18Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40483-40491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Complexes then proceed through promoter escape, during which numerous structural re-arrangements occur en route to formation of stable elongation complexes (19Dvir A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1577: 208-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have provided insight into many of the transformations that occur during promoter escape, including changes in the transcription bubble, transcript slippage, pausing of ternary complexes, release of TFIIB from the promoter, and formation of a stable RNA:DNA hybrid (4Holstege F.C.P.

Kinetic studies have identified the rate-limiting step in transcription in vitro as occurring during promoter escape (3Hieb A.R. Baran S. Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 24Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9232-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Experiments monitoring the melted region of DNA during promoter escape have shown that the upstream edge of the transcription bubble initially remains anchored while the downstream edge extends, thereby increasing the size of the bubble (4Holstege F.C.P. Fiedler U. Timmers H.T.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7468-7480Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 22Pal M. Ponticelli A.S. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 101-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After the bubble extends to 18 melted base pairs and synthesis of minimally a 7-nt RNA occurs, the upstream edge of the melted region re-anneals in a process termed bubble collapse; when this occurs the stability of transcribing complexes increases (22Pal M. Ponticelli A.S. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 101-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). During promoter escape, transcribing complexes can undergo transcript slippage (20Pal M. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Pal M. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5700-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Transcript slippage can occur when the RNA transcript contains a repetitive sequence, such as the CUCUCU observed in RNAs transcribed from the adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP). The repeat sequence allows the transcript to slip back by 2 bases and re-pair with the template strand at a different register before transcription continues, resulting in transcripts that are minimally 2 nt longer than expected. Additional rounds of slipping and extension can occur, resulting in ladders of products that increase in size by increments of 2 nt. Transcript slippage during promoter escape has been shown to be a sensor for ternary complex stability; once complexes complete the structural transformations that occur en route to becoming stable, processive complexes, then the ability of the transcript to slip is greatly reduced (21Pal M. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5700-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here we investigated the properties of transcript slippage in complexes assembled on AdMLP DNA containing a pre-melted transcription bubble from –9 to +3. Complexes begin slipping at a very defined point in the transcription reaction, after pol II completes phosphodiester bond synthesis at register +5. The position at which transcript slippage occurs is set by the position of the polymerase active site on the DNA template, as opposed to the length of the RNA transcript. Slipping at this juncture in the reaction is induced by TBP and TFIIB; it does not occur with pol II itself. Slipping also requires a TATA box, but it does not depend on a BRE. We propose that upon completing phosphodiester bond synthesis at register +5, transcribing complexes either complete productive synthesis of the transcript or undergo multiple rounds of transcript slipping. Preparation of Transcription Factors and Templates-Recombinant human TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF, and native human pol II were prepared as described previously (24Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9232-9237Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Weaver J.R. Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39860-39869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The wild-type bubble template contained the AdMLP core promoter sequence from –40 to +20, with the sequence of the nontemplate strand changed to match that of the template strand from –9 to +3 (see Fig. 1A). The template and non-template strand oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) were annealed in buffer containing 2 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.2 mm EDTA, and 250 mm KCl by heating to 95 °C for 3 min and then cooling to 25 °C at a rate of 0.1 °C/s using a thermocycler. The G-oligo (Fig. 3A) was ordered from Invitrogen.FIGURE 3Transcript slippage occurs after register +4 and prior to +9. A, DNA oligonucleotide (G-oligo) that inhibits the step of escape commitment represses both transcript slippage and synthesis of the productive transcript. Reactions were performed on the wild-type template (+11G) in the absence of GTP; the expected 10-nt product is indicated with an asterisk. When included, the G-oligo (1 μm) was added to reactions just prior to addition of the nucleotides. B, transcript slippage occurs prior to the rate-limiting step of productive transcription. Reactions were performed on the +6G template with pulse-chase labeling, and transcription was stopped at the time points indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Vitro Transcription Assays-Reactions were 20 μl and performed in a buffer containing 10% glycerol, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.9), 50 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 7 units of RNase Out (Invitrogen). Transcription factors and template DNA were used at the following final concentrations: 2 nm TBP, 10 nm TFIIB, 4 nm TFIIF, 1–3 nm pol II, and 1–2 nm DNA template and were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Transcription was initiated by addition of 500 μm ApC (Sigma), 100 μm UTP, and 25 μm [α-32P]CTP (5 μCi). When included GTP was added at 100 μm. For pulse-chase reactions, a pulse NTP solution was added for 15 s, resulting in final concentrations of 500 μm ApC, 100 μm UTP, and 1 μm [α-32P]CTP (5 μCi). A chase NTP solution was then added that increased the CTP concentration from 0.1 to 1 mm, and in some experiments included 100 μm GTP. After 20 min of transcription, reactions were stopped using 3.1 m ammonium acetate, 20 mm EDTA, 10 μg of carrier yeast RNA, and 15 μg of proteinase K. Transcripts were ethanol-precipitated, resolved by 20% denaturing PAGE, and visualized using phosphorimagery. Transcript Slippage on a Heteroduplex Template Exhibits Unique Characteristics-To investigate the mechanism of early transcription by pol II, we utilized a highly purified human transcription system containing TBP, TFIIB, TFIIF, pol II, and the AdMLP. To observe in vitro transcription using this minimal set of factors that lacked TFIIE and TFIIH, we took advantage of a linear AdMLP template containing mismatched sequence from –9 to +3, thereby creating a heteroduplex that mimicked the transcription bubble (Fig. 1A). Using the initiating dinucleotide ApC, along with CTP and UTP, a 10-nt RNA was synthesized from this template. Addition of GTP extended the product to 12 nt. When we performed transcription reactions with this bubble template, we observed a pattern of several products as opposed to only the expected products of 10 and 12 nt (Fig. 1B). All of the products initiated at the start site because bands virtually disappeared in control reactions performed in the absence of ApC (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 5–8 with lanes 1–4). The pattern of bands we observed was reminiscent of that documented by Pal and Luse (20Pal M. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Pal M. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5700-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) when they first reported that pol II can undergo transcript slippage during early transcription. In addition to the expected products of 10 and 12 nt, we observed predominant bands spaced by 2 nt (e.g. 7, 9, 11, and 13 nt), leading us to conclude that these products arose from transcript slippage. There are, however, differences between the transcript slippage we observed and that described previously. First, we observed products shorter than the expected product (7 and 9 nt, and 11 nt in the presence of GTP). Second, in the presence of GTP, the sizes of the slipped products did not change, but the size of the expected product shifted from 10 to 12 nt (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 3 and 4). This result indicated that the slipped transcripts never reached register +11 where the first G could be incorporated. To further probe this, we treated reactions with RNase T1, which cleaves 3′ of single-stranded G residues. The RNase treatment caused no change in the ladder of slipped products, but it did shorten the expected product synthesized in the presence of GTP from 12 to 10 nt, also indicating that the slipped RNAs do not contain G residues (Fig. 1C). Observing that the slipped products do not incorporate GTP suggested that the complexes undergoing transcript slippage were not capable of proceeding through promoter escape to reach register +11. To test this directly, we performed a pulse-chase experiment and monitored the fate of transcripts produced within the first 15 s after addition of nucleotides to preinitiation complexes. Reactions were pulsed for 15 s with [α-32P]CTP, UTP, and ApC, and then chased with a large excess of unlabeled CTP for 10 min. GTP was then added to determine the extent to which slipped RNAs could be extended by two nucleotides. As shown in Fig. 1D, the pattern and intensity of slipped products did not change upon addition of GTP; however, the expected product shifted from 10 to 12 nt. This indicated that the slipped products were either aborted or were part of ternary complexes not capable of resuming productive transcription once slipping had begun. Transcript Slippage on a Bubble Template Occurs after Phosphodiester Bond Synthesis at Register +5-To define the first point in the reaction at which transcript slippage could occur, we created a series of bubble templates in which the first G/C (nontemplate/template strand) was placed at every position from +11 (wild type) back to +6, which is the first position a G can be placed while still maintaining a repetitive CUCU sequence. Omitting GTP from reactions allowed us to pause transcribing complexes at specific positions during early transcription and ask whether or not slipping occurred. In the absence of GTP, we observed slipped products from each template (Fig. 2). The expected length of the non-slipped (productive) products shifted with different templates in accordance with the position of the first G. By contrast, all templates showed the same pattern of slipped products as follows: transcripts spaced 2 nt apart beginning with 7 nt, with the predominant slipped transcripts being 9, 11, and 13 nt. This suggested that on the AdMLP bubble template, slipping first occurred at register +5 after synthesis of ACUCU. At this point the transcript can slip back, with the 3′ end moving from register +5 to register +3, re-pair with the DNA, and be extended to 7 nt, after which the cycle of slipping can occur again. The predominant products of 9, 11, and 13 nt that we observed resulted from 2, 3, and 4 rounds of slipping and extension. Less prominent products of 15, 17, and 19 nt were also observed, indicating that additional rounds of slipping occurred. We were not able to see the 5-nt RNA produced from paused complexes on the +6G template, most likely because all RNA produced on this template underwent transcript slippage. To further probe the position in the transcription reaction at which slipping on a bubble template occurs, we took advantage of an inhibitor we previously found to block a very specific step in early transcription. The inhibitor, a DNA oligonucleotide consisting of 20 guanosine residues (G-oligo), blocks a step in transcription termed escape commitment that occurs during translocation of the pol II active site after synthesis of a 4-nt RNA (11Kugel J.F.

We reasoned that if slipping occurs after phosphodiester bond synthesis at register +5, then an inhibitor that blocks transcription prior to this point should inhibit transcript slippage as well as synthesis of the productive transcript. When we added the G-oligo to transcription reactions, both the expected 10-nt product and the slipped products were inhibited (Fig. 3A). This shows that slipping occurs after synthesis of a 4-nt RNA. Moreover, because slipping was inhibited by the G-oligo, we can conclude that the slipped products arise from complexes that proceed through the normal escape commitment step in the transcription reaction. Our previous kinetic studies found that the rate-limiting step in early transcription occurs after synthesis of an 8-nt RNA as the polymerase active site translocates to the ninth register (3Hieb A.R. Baran S. Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our studies here predict that transcribing complexes begin slipping prior to the rate-limiting step. Although slipped RNAs reach lengths beyond 8 nt, it was not known whether complexes undergoing slipping would proceed through the typical slow transformation. To address these issues, we measured the rate at which slipped transcripts accumulate on the +6G template using pulse-chase conditions to limit detectable transcription to a single round. We found that the pattern and intensity of slipped products did not change over time (Fig. 3B). This shows that complexes begin slipping prior to the rate-limiting step during promoter escape, that slipping itself (be it one or multiple rounds) is quite rapid, and that complexes undergoing slipping do not proceed through the slow transition that typically occurs after synthesis of an 8-nt RNA, despite the lengths of many slipped products being longer than 8 nt. The Point at Which Transcript Slippage Occurs Is Set by the Repeat Sequence from +2 to +5 and the Position of the Polymerase Active Site on the DNA-We next asked whether slipping required that the CUCU repeat sequence that allows slipping to occur be located from +2 to +5. In the context of the +8G template we changed the sequence at +3 from T/T to G/G (nontemplate/template strand); therefore, the RNA transcribed in the absence of GTP would have the sequence ACCCUCU (see the sequences at the top of Fig. 4A). Therefore, the only CUCU repeat sequence is present at +4 to +7. As shown in Fig. 4A, transcript slippage did not occur on this template. This indicates that it is not simply the presence of a CUCU repeat in the RNA that induces transcript slippage on a bubble template. Rather, the CUCU repeat needs to occur at a specific register during early transcription, namely from +2 to +5, for slipping to occur. We previously found that the points at which escape commitment and the rate-limiting step occur are set by the length of the transcript as opposed to the position of the pol II active site on the DNA template (3Hieb A.R. Baran S. Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We speculated that this might be a general feature of transitions that occur during early transcription; hence we asked whether the point in the reaction at which transcript slippage occurs is set by the length of the RNA (5 nt) or by the position of the pol II active site on the DNA (register +5). To do so, we took advantage of the ability of pol II to initiate transcription at –1 in the presence of the dinucleotide CpA. We monitored transcript slippage from the +6G promoter in the absence of GTP when the start site was changed from +1 to –1 by replacing ApC with CpA. Doing so increased the length of the RNA from 5 to 6 nt at the point at which ternary complexes paused, without changing the position of the pol II active site along the DNA. As shown in Fig. 4B, moving the initiation site from +1 to –1 on the +6G promoter did not change the amount or pattern of slipped products that occurred, rather it changed the size of the products. In other words, a pattern of 6-, 8-, 10-, 12-, and 14-nt products was observed with CpA instead of the 7-, 9-, 11-, 13-, and 15-nt products observed with ApC. Hence, the position at which slipping occurred did not correlate with the length of the RNA that contained the CUCU repeat; slipping occurred at register +5 after synthesis of either a 5- or a 6-nt transcript. Rather, the position at which slipping occurred (register +5) correlated with the position of the pol II active site on the promoter. TBP and TFIIB Are Required to Induce Transcript Slippage on a Bubble Template-pol II itself, in the absence of general transcription factors, can specifically initiate transcription from a bubble template when a dinucleotide primer is used (26Keene R.G. Luse D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11526-11534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This provided the opportunity to probe the contributions that the general transcription factors make to transcript slippage. We first performed experiments in which each factor in the transcription reaction was individually omitted. As shown in Fig. 5A, when either TBP or TFIIB was omitted, slipping no longer occurred (compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). When TFIIF was omitted (Fig. 5A, lane 4), slipping occurred although to a lower extent. Omitting all three general factors resulted in a single 12-nt product produced by pol II alone (Fig. 5A, lane 6), although the amount of product was far less than that observed when any single general factor was omitted. (To better see the product in Fig. 5A, lane 6, a darker exposure of the gel is shown to the right.) We also performed reactions in which each general factor was individually added to pol II alone or to pol II/TFIIF. We again found that both TBP and TFIIB were needed in order for slipping to occur, and that the amount of slipped product was increased by TFIIF (Fig. 5B). Finally, we speculated that perhaps TBP or TFIIB alone could force transcript slippage to occur if present at higher concentrations. When TBP and TFIIB were individually titrated to 10-fold higher concentrations, transcript slippage did not occur (Fig. 5C). We conclude that transcript slippage on a bubble template requires both TBP and TFIIB and is enhanced by TFIIF. Slipping on a Bubble Template Requires a TATA Box-To determine whether specific protein-DNA contacts involving TBP and TFIIB were important for slipping, we deleted the core promoter from upstream, first removing the BRE and then the TATA box (Fig. 6A). As shown in Fig. 6B (lanes 1–4), transcript slippage did not require the BRE; in its absence TBP and TFIIB induced transcript slippage. This indicated that contacts between TFIIB and DNA were likely not the cause of slipping. Further deleting the DNA to omit the TATA box eliminated slipping (Fig. 6B, lanes 5–8). We conclude that the TATA box is required for slipping to occur, consistent with a model in which DNA-bound TBP facilitates, but is not sufficient for, transcript slippage. To further understand the mechanism of the early steps in transcription by human pol II, we investigated the molecular determinants of transcript slippage on a heteroduplex template. We determined the contributions of individual transcription factors, DNA elements, and RNA length to slipping. We found that the point in the transcription reaction at which slipping can first occur is after phosphodiester bond synthesis at register +5. This point is dictated by the position of the polymerase active site on the DNA and a repetitive CUCU sequence occurring from +2 to +5 in the RNA. TBP and TFIIB are required for slipping on a bubble template, as are contacts between TBP and the TATA box. We propose a model in which the transcription reaction branches at register +5 between productive complexes and complexes that undergo transcript slippage. Moreover, slippage is a sensor for contacts in the network of TBP, TFIIB, and pol II interactions that are important during early transcription. Fig. 7 shows a model in which transcribing complexes, upon completing bond synthesis at register +5, either proceed through promoter escape or undergo one or more rounds of transcript slippage. Complexes that slip give rise to transcripts that are minimally 7 nt in length and increase in size by 2 nt with each additional round of slipping. We found that the pattern of slipped products did not change as transcription was paused at each register beyond +5, indicating that slipping could first occur at +5. Kinetic experiments showed that complexes begin slipping prior to the rate-limiting step, which is complete by register +9. When the template was mutated such that the CUCU repeat first occurred from +4 to +7, slipping did not occur, indicating that on the heteroduplex template the position at which the reaction branches between productive transcription and slipping is uniquely positioned at register +5. Our data also show that once complexes begin slipping, they cannot resume productive transcription. Similarly, once complexes commit to proceeding with productive transcription, they do not slip despite a repetitive sequence that would permit slipping to occur at register +7. This means that in complexes that undergo slipping, the pol II active site never progresses beyond register +5. Prior to register +5, both slipped and productive complexes undergo the same transformations during early transcription because the G-oligo (which blocks translocation of the pol II active site after synthesis of a 4-nt RNA (11Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar)) inhibited both slipping and synthesis of the productive transcript. Some of the characteristics that define transcript slippage on a heteroduplex template are different from other steps we have characterized that occur during early transcription. For example, the point in the reaction at which slipping can occur is set by the position of the pol II active site on the DNA. This is different from the step of escape commitment and the rate-limiting step, the positions of which are both set by the length of the RNA (4 and 8 nt, respectively) (3Hieb A.R. Baran S. Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This indicates that slipping is more tightly linked to the conformation of the DNA, for example the position and size of the transcription bubble, as opposed to the length of the RNA:DNA hybrid. We also found that transcript slippage depends on the general transcription factors TBP and TFIIB, whereas both escape commitment and the rate-limiting step depends only on pol II; these transformations occur in the absence of general factors (3Hieb A.R. Baran S. Goodrich J.A. Kugel J.F. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 11Kugel J.F. Goodrich J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 762-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These contrasting characteristics demonstrate that the contributions made by transcription factors, DNA elements, and RNA length to the mechanisms by which steps in early transcription occur are not universal. Transcript slippage was first characterized by Pal and Luse (20Pal M. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Pal M. Luse D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5700-5705Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using linear AdMLP templates and HeLa nuclear extracts. They observed products in 2-nt increments longer than expected, found that slipping was significantly reduced at register +8/+9, and found that slipping was greatly reduced when transcription was initiated at –1 with the dinucleotide CpA. In these experiments, the ability of a complex to undergo transcript slippage was a reflection of ternary complex stability; when complexes completed the stabilizing structural transformations that occur during promoter escape, the ability of the transcript to slip was greatly reduced. Slipping on a heteroduplex template is different in that it occurs uniquely at register +5, results in products both shorter and longer than the expected transcript, occurs whether transcription initiates at –1 or +1, and likely reflects the role of protein-protein and protein-DNA contacts involving TBP, TFIIB, and pol II during early transcription. The ability of transcripts to slip may be a general sensor for unique structural transformations that occur during early transcription. The observation that TBP and TFIIB induce transcript slippage on a heteroduplex template in a TATA box-dependent fashion indicates that slipping is a sensor for contacts that occur between TBP/TATA, TFIIB, and pol II. Previous studies have shown that contacts between TFIIB and pol II influence steps that occur after preinitiation complexes have formed (reviewed in Ref. 27Deng W. Roberts S.G. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2007; 116: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, slipping could be triggered by TFIIB-pol II interactions that are critical for the mechanism of early transcription. The requirement for TBP and a TATA box to observe slipping could either indicate that the TBP-DNA complex is required to recruit and position TFIIB in preinitiation complexes or that direct contacts between pol II and TBP also participate in inducing complexes to slip. In this manner, the network of contacts between TBP-TATA, TFIIB, and pol II that are critical for forming preinitiation complexes also have the potential to impede productive transcription."

https://openalex.org/W2020424448,"Tallysomycins (TLMs) belong to the bleomycin family of anticancer antibiotics. TLMs differ from bleomycins primarily by the presence of a 4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-l-talose sugar attached to C-41 as part of a glycosylcarbinolamide. We previously proposed, on the basis of bioinformatics analysis of the <i>tlm</i> biosynthetic gene cluster from <i>Streptoalloteichus hindustanus</i> E465-94 ATCC 31158, that the <i>tlmK</i> gene is responsible for the attachment of this sugar moiety. We now report that inactivation of <i>tlmK</i> in <i>S. hindustanus</i> abolished TLM A and TLM B production, the resultant Δ<i>tlmK</i> mutant instead accumulated five new metabolites, and introduction of a functional copy of <i>tlmK</i> to the Δ<i>tlmK</i> mutant restored TLM A and TLM B production. Two major metabolites, TLM K-1 and TLM K-2, together with three minor metabolites, TLM K-3, TLM K-4, and TLM K-5, were isolated from the Δ<i>tlmK</i> mutant, and their structures were elucidated. These findings provide experimental evidence supporting the previous functional assignment of <i>tlmK</i> to encode a glycosyltransferase and unveil two carbinolamide pseudoaglycones as key intermediates in the TLM biosynthetic pathway. TlmK stabilizes the carbinolamide intermediates by glycosylating their hemiaminal hydroxyl groups, thereby protecting them from hydrolysis during TLM biosynthesis. In the absence of TlmK, the carbinolamide intermediates fragment to produce an amide TLM K-1 and aldehyde intermediates, which undergo further oxidative fragmentation to afford carboxylic acids TLM K-2, TLM K-3, TLM K-4, and TLM K-5."
