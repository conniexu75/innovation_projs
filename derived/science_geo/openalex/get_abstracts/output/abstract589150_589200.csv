Recent advances in band theory have expanded the classification of fermions in crystals, and revealed crystal symmetry-protected electron excitations that have no high-energy counterparts. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we demonstrate the existence of a triply degenerate point in the electronic structure of MoP crystal, where the quasiparticle excitations are beyond the Majorana-Weyl-Dirac classification. Furthermore, we observe pairs of Weyl points in the bulk electronic structure coexisting with the 'new fermions', thus introducing a platform for studying the interplay between different types of fermions."

A sample of 327 primary caregivers was recruited through a one-stage cluster sampling in Ningxiang County of Hunan province, China. Family burden was assessed using the Family Burden Interview Schedule (FBIS) of Pai and Kapur. Our results showed that the mean score of FBIS was 23.62±9.76 (range, 0-48), with over half (52%) caregivers reported their family burden being moderate and severe. Among the six domains of family burden, financial burden (76%) was the commonest burden, while disruption of family interactions (37%) was the least mentioned. A multivariate analysis of family burden revealed that patient being admitted for over 3 times, caregiver being female, having a middle school education, and with additional dependents, as well as higher care network function were positive predictors of family burden, while higher patient function and family function, and increasing patient age were negative predictors of family burden. Intervention to decrease family burden may be best served by improving family function and exploring alternative care model instead of hospitalization."
https://openalex.org/W2655076168,"Bisphenol A (BPA) exposure has been suspected to be associated with deleterious effects on health including obesity and metabolically-linked diseases. Although bisphenols F (BPF) and S (BPS) are BPA structural analogs commonly used in many marketed products as a replacement for BPA, only sparse toxicological data are available yet. Our objective was to comprehensively characterize bisphenols gene targets in a human primary adipocyte model, in order to determine whether they may induce cellular dysfunction, using chronic exposure at two concentrations: a ""low-dose"" similar to the dose usually encountered in human biological fluids and a higher dose. Therefore, BPA, BPF and BPS have been added at 10 nM or 10 μM during the differentiation of human primary adipocytes from subcutaneous fat of three non-diabetic Caucasian female patients. Gene expression (mRNA/lncRNA) arrays and microRNA arrays, have been used to assess coding and non-coding RNA changes. We detected significantly deregulated mRNA/lncRNA and miRNA at low and high doses. Enrichment in ""cancer"" and ""organismal injury and abnormalities"" related pathways was found in response to the three products. Some long intergenic non-coding RNAs and small nucleolar RNAs were differentially expressed suggesting that bisphenols may also activate multiple cellular processes and epigenetic modifications. The analysis of upstream regulators of deregulated genes highlighted hormones or hormone-like chemicals suggesting that BPS and BPF can be suspected to interfere, just like BPA, with hormonal regulation and have to be considered as endocrine disruptors. All these results suggest that as BPA, its substitutes BPS and BPF should be used with the same restrictions."
https://openalex.org/W2719167248,"Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is a powerful antagonist of canonical WNT signaling pathway, and is regarded as a biomarker for osteoporosis. Its expression is highly correlated with bone mass and osteoblasts maturation. In this study, mouse primary bone marrow cells and osteoblast cell lines were used. Luciferase reporter assay and western blotting methods were employed to validate if miRNA-433-3p epigenetically regulated DKK1 translation. Rat bone marrow derived osteoblasts were infected with lentivirus vector in which miR-433-3p was constructed. The authors constructed lentivirus mediated miRNA-433-3p stable expression and examined the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and mineral deposition level in vitro. In situ hybridization method was used to observe miR-433-3p in primary osteoblasts. We built up an OVX rat model to mimic postmenopausal osteoporosis, and found aberrant circulating miR-433-3p and miR-106b, which were not reported previously. Results showed that miR-433-3p potentially regulated DKK1 mRNA, Furthermore, the correlation of serum DKK1 with circulating miR-433-3p level was significant (r = 0.7520, p = 0.046). In the luciferase reporter assay, we found that miR-433-3p siRNA decreased luminescence signal, indicating direct regulation of miR-433-3p on DKK1 mRNA. When the miR-433-3p binding site in DKK1 3’UTR was mutant, such reduction was prohibited. Western blotting result validated that miR-433-3p inhibited over 90% of DKK1 protein expression. Similarly, the change of protein expression was not observed in mutant group. The stable expression of lentivirus mediated miR-433-3p increased ALP activity and mineralization both in human and rat derived immortalized cells. We found that primary osteoblasts had higher miR-433-3p level compared with immortal cells through real-time PCR, as well as in situ hybridization experiment. Conclusively, our findings further emphasized the vital role of miR-433-3p in DKK1/WNT/β-catenin pathway through decreasing DKK1 expression and inducing osteoblasts differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2638864431,"Curcumin, an extract from the turmeric rhizome (Curcuma longa), is known to exhibit anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, chemopreventive and antitumoral activities against aggressive and recurrent cancers. Accumulative data indicate that curcumin may induce cancer cell death. However, the detailed mechanism underlying its pro-apoptotic and anti-cancer effects remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined the signaling pathways triggered by curcumin, specifically, the exact molecular mechanisms of curcumin-induced apoptosis in highly metastatic human prostate cancer cells. The effect of curcumin was evaluated using for the first time in prostate cancer, a gel-free shotgun quantitative proteomic analysis coupled with Tandem Mass Tag isobaric labeling-based-signaling networks. Results were confirmed at the gene expression level by qRT-PCR and at the protein expression level by western blot and flow cytometry. Our findings revealed that curcumin induced an Endoplasmic Reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in PC3. The mechanisms by which curcumin promoted cell death in these cells were associated with cell cycle arrest, increased reactive oxygen species, autophagy and the Unfolded Protein Response. Furthermore, the upregulation of ER stress was measured using key indicators of ER stress: Glucose-Regulated Protein 78, Inositol-Requiring Enzyme 1 alpha, Protein Disulfide isomerase and Calreticulin. Chronic ER stress induction was concomitant with the upregulation of pro-apoptotic markers (caspases 3,9,12) and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. The downregulated proteins include anti-apoptotic and anti-tumor markers, supporting their curcumin-induced pro-apoptotic role in prostate cancer cells. Taken together, these data suggest that curcumin may serve as a promising anticancer agent by inducing a chronic ER stress mediated cell death and activation of cell cycle arrest, UPR, autophagy and oxidative stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2645404107,"As a catadromous species, salinity is a key parameter that affects gonadal development of Chinese mitten crab Eriocheir sinensis during reproductive migration. It is however unclear the effects of salinity on the gonadal development of male E. sinensis as well as their physiological responses to salinity during reproductive migration. This study investigated the effects of four salinities (0 ‰, 6 ‰, 12 ‰ and 18 ‰) on gonadal development, osmoregulation and metabolism of adult male E. sinensis over a 40-day period. The results showed that elevating salinity promote gonadal development, increase hemolymph osmolality and K+ and Mg2+ concentrations (P < 0.05). The 12 ‰ salinity resulted in the highest contents of taurine and arginine in the hemolymph while the highest contents of threonine, phenylalanine, lysine, ß-alanine, tryptophan, ornithine and total free amino acids were found for 0 ‰ treatment (P < 0.05). A decreasing trend was detected for the Na+/K+-ATPase activity and its mRNA expression level in the posterior gills with salinity (P < 0.05). Total saturated fatty acids in the anterior gills decreased with increasing salinity (P < 0.05); the 0 ‰ treatment had the highest total polyunsaturated fatty acids in the posterior gills while total n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids increased with salinity (P < 0.05). The hemolymph glucose and uric acid showed a decreasing trend as salinity while an increasing trend was found for the hemolymph triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < 0.05). The 12 ‰ treatment had the highest levels of hemolymph malonaldehyde and hepatopancreatic γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (P < 0.05). In conclusion, these results suggested that the brackish water promote gonadal development of male E. sinensis, and increase osmolality and ionic concentrations in hemolymph while reduced the activity of Na+ /K+- ATPase and its mRNA expression in the posterior gills as well as metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2692261634,"The number of patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) is increasing worldwide and most of them will require cardiac surgery, once or more, during their lifetime. The total volume of cardiac surgery in CHD patients at a national level and the associated mortality and predictors of death associated with surgery are not known. We aimed to investigate the surgical volume and associated mortality in CHD patients in England.Using a national hospital episode statistics database, we identified all CHD patients undergoing cardiac surgery in England between 1997 and 2015.We evaluated 57,293 patients (median age 11.9years, 46.7% being adult, 56.7% female). There was a linear increase in the number of operations performed per year from 1,717 in 1997 to 5,299 performed in 2014. The most common intervention at the last surgical event was an aortic valve procedure (9,276; 16.2%), followed by repair of atrial septal defect (9,154; 16.0%), ventricular septal defect (7,746; 13.5%), tetralogy of Fallot (3,523; 6.1%) and atrioventricular septal defect (3,330; 5.8%) repair. Associated mortality remained raised up to six months following cardiac surgery. Several parameters were predictive of post-operative mortality, including age, complexity of surgery, need for emergency surgery and socioeconomic status. The relationship of age with mortality was ""U""-shaped, and mortality was highest amongst youngest children and adults above 60 years of age.The number of cardiac operations performed in CHD patients in England has been increasing, particularly in adults. Mortality remains raised up to 6-months after surgery and was highest amongst young children and seniors."
https://openalex.org/W2656885479,"Background This study aimed to investigate the pathophysiology of hepatic microcirculatory dysfunction in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Methods In Wistar rats, NAFLD model was induced by 20 weeks of high-fat diet (HFD) feeding. Rolling and adhesion of leukocytes and tissue perfusion in hepatic microcirculation were examined using in vivo microscopic and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI), respectively. Oxidative stress and inflamatory parameters were analysed by TBARs, catalase enzyme activity, RT-PCR and ELISA. The participation of advanced glycation end-products (AGE) and its receptor RAGE was evaluated by the measurement of gene and protein expression of RAGE by RT-PCR and Western-blot, respectively and by liver and serum quantification of fluorescent AGEs. Results Wistar rats fed high-fat diet (HFD) showed increase in epididymal and abdominal fat content, systolic arterial blood pressure, fasting blood glucose levels, hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol, and impairment of glucose and insulin metabolisms. Liver histology confirmed the presence of steatosis and ultrasound analysis revealed increased liver size and parenchymal echogenicity in HFD-fed rats. HFD causes significant increases in leukocyte rolling and adhesion on hepatic microcirculation and decrease in liver microvascular blood flow. Liver tissue presented increase in oxidative stress and inflammtion. At 20 weeks, there was a significantly increase in AGE content in the liver and serum of HFD-fed rats and an increase in RAGE gene expression in the liver. Conclusion The increase in liver AGE levels and microcirculatory disturbances could play a role in the pathogenesis of liver injury and are key components of NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W2648902637,"Flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) is a structure selective endonuclease required for proficient DNA replication and the repair of DNA damage. Cellularly active inhibitors of this enzyme have previously been shown to induce a DNA damage response and, ultimately, cell death. High-throughput screens of human cancer cell-lines identify colorectal and gastric cell-lines with microsatellite instability (MSI) as enriched for cellular sensitivity to N-hydroxyurea series inhibitors of FEN1, but not the PARP inhibitor olaparib or other inhibitors of the DNA damage response. This sensitivity is due to a synthetic lethal interaction between FEN1 and MRE11A, which is often mutated in MSI cancers through instabilities at a poly(T) microsatellite repeat. Disruption of ATM is similarly synthetic lethal with FEN1 inhibition, suggesting that disruption of FEN1 function leads to the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks. These are likely a result of the accumulation of aberrant replication forks, that accumulate as a consequence of a failure in Okazaki fragment maturation, as inhibition of FEN1 is toxic in cells disrupted for the Fanconi anemia pathway and post-replication repair. Furthermore, RAD51 foci accumulate as a consequence of FEN1 inhibition and the toxicity of FEN1 inhibitors increases in cells disrupted for the homologous recombination pathway, suggesting a role for homologous recombination in the resolution of damage induced by FEN1 inhibition. Finally, FEN1 appears to be required for the repair of damage induced by olaparib and cisplatin within the Fanconi anemia pathway, and may play a role in the repair of damage associated with its own disruption."
https://openalex.org/W2640176347,"To use the ""apparent diffusion coefficient"" (Dapp) as a quantitative imaging parameter, well-suited test fluids are essential. In this study, the previously proposed aqueous solutions of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) were examined and temperature calibrations were obtained. For example, at a temperature of 20°C, Dapp ranged from 1.594 (95% CI: 1.593, 1.595) μm2/ms to 0.3326 (95% CI: 0. 3304, 0.3348) μm2/ms for PVP-concentrations ranging from 10% (w/w) to 50% (w/w) using K30 polymer lengths. The temperature dependence of Dapp was found to be so strong that a negligence seems not advisable. The temperature dependence is descriptively modelled by an exponential function exp(c2 (T - 20°C)) and the determined c2 values are reported, which can be used for temperature calibration. For example, we find the value 0.02952 K-1 for 30% (w/w) PVP-concentration and K30 polymer length. In general, aqueous PVP solutions were found to be suitable to produce easily applicable and reliable Dapp-phantoms."
https://openalex.org/W2683084668,"Ionizing radiation from natural sources or anthropogenic activity has the potential to cause oxidative stress or genetic damage in living organisms, through the ionization and excitation of molecules and the subsequent production of free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS). The present work focuses on radiation-induced biological effects using the zebrafish (Danio rerio) vertebrate model. Changes in developmental traits and gene expression in zebrafish were assessed after continuous external gamma irradiation (0.4, 3.9, 15 and 38 mGy/h) with corresponding controls, starting at 2.5 hours post fertilization (hpf) and lasting through embryogenesis and the early larval stage. The lowest dose rate corresponded to recommended benchmarks at which adverse effects are not expected to occur in aquatic ecosystems (2–10 mGy/day). The survival observed at 96 hours post fertilization (hpf) in the 38 mGy/h group was significantly lower, while other groups showed no significant difference compared to controls. The total hatching was significantly lower from controls in the 15 mGy/h group and a delay in hatching onset in the 0.4 mGy/h group was observed. The deformity frequency was significantly increased by prolonged exposure duration at dose rates ≥ 0.4 mGy/h. Molecular responses analyzed by RNA-seq at gastrulation (5.5 hpf transcriptome) indicate that the radiation induced adverse effects occurred during the earliest stages of development. A dose-response relationship was found in the numbers of differentially regulated genes in exposure groups compared to controls at a total dose as low as 1.62 mGy. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis identified retinoic acid receptor activation, apoptosis, and glutathione mediated detoxification signaling as the most affected pathways in the lower dose rate (0.54 mGy/h), while eif2 and mTOR, i.e., involved in the modulation of angiogenesis, were most affected in higher dose rates (5.4 and 10.9 mGy/h). By comparing gene expression data, myc was found to be the most significant upstream regulator, followed by tp53, TNF, hnf4a, TGFb1 and cebpa, while crabp2b and vegfab were identified as most frequent downstream target genes. These genes are associated with various developmental processes. The present findings show that continuous gamma irradiation (≥ 0.54 mGy/h) during early gastrula causes gene expression changes that are linked to developmental defects in zebrafish embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2703441741,"The use of long-term catheterisation to manage insensate bladders, often associated with spinal cord injury (SCI), increases the risk of microbial colonisation and infection of the urinary tract. Urinary tract infection (UTI) is typically diagnosed and treated based on the culturing of organisms from the urine, although this approach overlooks low titer, slow growing and non-traditional pathogens. Here, we present an investigation of the urinary tract microbiome in catheterised SCI individuals, using T-RFLP and metagenomic sequencing of the microbial community. We monitored three neurogenic patients over a period of 12 months, who were part of a larger study investigating the efficacy of probiotics in controlling UTIs, to determine how their urinary tract microbial community composition changed over time and in relation to probiotic treatment regimens. Bacterial biofilms adherent to urinary catheters were examined as a proxy for bladder microbes. The microbial community composition of the urinary tract differed significantly between individuals. Probiotic therapy resulted in a significant change in the microbial community associated with the catheters. The community also changed as a consequence of UTI and this shift in community composition preceded the clinical diagnosis of infection. Changes in the microbiota due to probiotic treatment or infection were transient, resolving to microbial communities similar to their pre-treatment communities, suggesting that the native community was highly resilient. Based on these results, we propose that monitoring a patient's microbial community can be used to track the health of chronically catheterized patients and thus, can be used as part of a health-status monitoring program."
https://openalex.org/W2950902065,"Protein kinases are critical drug targets for treating a large variety of human diseases. Type-III kinase inhibitors have attracted increasing attention as highly selective therapeutics. Thus, understanding the binding mechanism of existing type-III kinase inhibitors provides useful insights into designing new type-III kinase inhibitors. In this work, we have systematically studied the binding mode of MEK-targeted type-III inhibitors using structural systems pharmacology and molecular dynamics simulation. Our studies provide detailed sequence, structure, interaction-fingerprint, pharmacophore and binding-site information on the binding characteristics of MEK type-III kinase inhibitors. We hypothesize that the helix-folding activation loop is a hallmark allosteric binding site for type-III inhibitors. Subsequently, we screened and predicted allosteric binding sites across the human kinome, suggesting other kinases as potential targets suitable for type-III inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W2645333552,"Recently, resistance to the pyrethroid bifenthrin was detected and confirmed in field populations of western corn rootworm, Diabrotica virgifera virgifera LeConte from southwestern areas of Nebraska and Kansas. As a first step to understand potential mechanisms of resistance, the objectives of this study were i) to assess adult mortality at diagnostic concentration-LC99 to the pyrethroids bifenthrin and tefluthrin as well as DDT, ii) estimate adult and larval susceptibility to the same compounds as well as the organophosphate methyl-parathion, and iii) perform synergism experiments with piperonyl butoxide (PBO) (P450 inhibitor) and S,S,S-tributyl-phosphorotrithioate (DEF) (esterase inhibitor) in field populations. Most of the adult field populations exhibiting some level of bifenthrin resistance exhibited significantly lower mortality to both pyrethroids and DDT than susceptible control populations at the estimated LC99 of susceptible populations. Results of adult dose-mortality bioassays also revealed elevated LC50 values for bifenthrin resistant populations compared to the susceptible control population with resistance ratios ranging from 2.5 to 5.5-fold for bifenthrin, 28 to 54.8-fold for tefluthrin, and 16.3 to 33.0 for DDT. These bioassay results collectively suggest some level of cross-resistance between the pyrethroids and DDT. In addition, both PBO and DEF reduced the resistance ratios for resistant populations although there was a higher reduction in susceptibility of adults exposed to PBO versus DEF. Susceptibility in larvae varied among insecticides and did not correlate with adult susceptibility to tefluthrin and DDT, as most resistance ratios were < 5-fold when compared to the susceptible population. These results suggest that both detoxifying enzymes and target site insensitivity might be involved as resistance mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2706832864,"Type II Bartter syndrome is caused by mutations in the renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) channel, but the molecular mechanisms underlying this disease are poorly defined. To rapidly screen for ROMK function, we developed a yeast expression system and discovered that yeast cells lacking endogenous potassium channels could be rescued by WT ROMK but not by ROMK proteins containing any one of four Bartter mutations. We also found that the mutant proteins were significantly less stable than WT ROMK. However, their degradation was slowed in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor or when yeast cells contained mutations in the CDC48 or SSA1 gene, which is required for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD). Consistent with these data, sucrose gradient centrifugation and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that most ROMK protein was ER-localized. To translate these findings to a more relevant cell type, we measured the stabilities of WT ROMK and the ROMK Bartter mutants in HEK293 cells. As in yeast, the Bartter mutant proteins were less stable than the WT protein, and their degradation was slowed in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor. Finally, we discovered that low-temperature incubation increased the steady-state levels of a Bartter mutant, suggesting that the disease-causing mutation traps the protein in a folding-deficient conformation. These findings indicate that the underlying pathology for at least a subset of patients with type II Bartter syndrome is linked to the ERAD pathway and that future therapeutic strategies should focus on correcting deficiencies in ROMK folding.

Approximately one-third of all proteins in eukaryotes are targeted to the secretory pathway. Among these substrates, secreted and membrane proteins play a pivotal role in intercellular communication and the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Protein folding in the secretory pathway must therefore be meticulously controlled. However, many proteins fold slowly or inefficiently. This can lead to the accumulation of misfolded proteins and subsequent delivery to cellular quality control machineries that target aberrant polypeptides for degradation or for refolding with the assistance of molecular chaperones (1.Brandvold K.R.

When a misfolded protein in the secretory pathway is targeted for degradation, it can follow one of several routes: 1) chaperone-mediated selection in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), 2The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumERADER-associated degradationKirinwardly rectifying family of potassium channelsROMKrenal outer medullary potassium channelCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorENaCepithelial sodium channelG6PDglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. retrotranslocation to the cytoplasm, and degradation by the cytoplasmic proteasome; 2) aggregation and delivery to the lysosome for destruction via autophagy; 3) entrapment within early compartments in the secretory pathway; or 4) trafficking to the Golgi apparatus or plasma membrane, where post-ER quality control pathways select the protein for degradation in the lysosome. In the first of these routes, proteasome-dependent degradation proceeds via a process known as ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Over 70 human diseases have been linked to ERAD, either through overzealous degradation of modestly misfolded proteins or failure to recognize toxic proteins (3.Guerriero C.J. Brodsky J.L.

A key player in the regulation of salt and potassium homeostasis in the kidney is ROMK (KCNJ1, Kir1.1), which is a member of the inwardly rectifying family of potassium channels (Kir) (26.Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Inward rectifier potassium channels.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). ROMK is expressed at the apical surface of epithelial cells in the distal nephron, including the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the cortical collecting duct (27.Wang W.

Molecular diversity and regulation of renal potassium channels.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 319-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In the thick ascending limb, ROMK participates in potassium recycling across the apical membrane, a process vital to support the function of the NKCC2 co-transporter that represents the rate-limiting step for salt reabsorption in this nephron segment (29.Hebert S.C. Andreoli T.E. Control of NaCl transport in the thick ascending limb.Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: F745-F756PubMed Google Scholar). In the cortical collecting duct, ROMK contributes to a major potassium excretory pathway in concert with the high-conductance, calcium-activated BK potassium channels (30.Rieg T. Vallon V.

Molecular defects in ROMK channel trafficking that give rise to type II Bartter syndrome have also been described (41.Schwalbe R.A. Bianchi L. Accili E.A. Brown A.M.

Bartter syndromes and other salt-losing tubulopathies.Nephron Physiol. 2006; 104: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and it is unknown whether any of the disease-causing mutations enhance the selection of ROMK for ERAD. ROMK exists as three isoforms (ROMK1–3), each with different N-terminal amino acid sequences that are generated via alternative splicing and promoter usage (44.Boim M.A. Ho K. Shuck M.E.

Mutations in any of the isoforms lead to a constellation of deleterious effects associated with type II Bartter syndrome, and to date ∼60 disease-causing mutations in the gene encoding ROMK (KCNJ1) have been identified (47.Welling P.

Genet. 2008; 40: 592-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar) (Human Gene Mutation Database; OMIM number 600359). Type II Bartter syndrome is evident in the antenatal period and includes polyhydramnios, prematurity, polyuria, nephrocalcinosis, osteopenia, and transient hyperkalemic metabolic acidosis followed by lifelong hypokalemic alkalosis (49.Seyberth H.W. Schlingmann K.P. Bartter- and Gitelman-like syndromes: salt-losing tubulopathies with loop or DCT defects.Pediatr. Nephrol. 2011; 26: 1789-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Bartter mutants caused by N-terminal nonsense or frameshift mutations have clear deleterious consequences on protein expression. The other mutations can generally be grouped into two broad categories: those that disrupt the biophysical properties of the channel, such as gating, ion selectivity, or ligand binding, and those that disrupt trafficking and reduce ROMK channel surface density at the plasma membrane (50.Fang L. Li D. Welling P.A. Hypertension resistance polymorphisms in ROMK (Kir1.1) alter channel function by different mechanisms.Am. J. Physiol.

Among the ∼60 known type II Bartter mutations, four mutations known to affect protein trafficking, A198T, R212P, H270Y, and Y314C, are clustered in the β-sheet–rich immunoglobulin-like domain in the cytosolic C-terminal region of ROMK (Fig. 1). Previous studies demonstrated that some of these mutations impede post-ER trafficking in Xenopus oocytes or HEK 293 cells (51.Peters M. Ermert S. Jeck N. Derst C. Pechmann U. Weber S.

The Kir channel immunoglobulin domain is essential for Kir1.1 (ROMK) thermodynamic stability, trafficking and gating.Channels. 2009; 3: 57-68Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because these Bartter mutants are retained in the ER and may exhibit folding defects, the goal of the current study was to test the hypothesis that the mutations destabilize ROMK so that it is instead targeted for ERAD. To this end, we developed a new ROMK1 yeast expression system that allows for a facile and quantitative read-out for ROMK1 function and plasma membrane residence. We discovered that yeast cells expressing the Bartter mutants grow poorly on low-K+ media, suggesting that the mutant proteins are unstable and/or fail to traffic to the plasma membrane. As hypothesized, degradation was proteasome-dependent, relied on the AAA+ ATPase Cdc48, and was mediated by the Hsp70 molecular chaperone, which plays a role in the selection of other unstable ion channels (53.Grove D.E.

Sucrose gradient centrifugation and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that the majority of ROMK1 was ER-localized, consistent with the mutant channels being subjected to ERAD. We then validated these findings in human cells and showed that the Bartter syndrome-associated ROMK1 alleles are similarly targeted for ERAD. This study demonstrates for the first time that Bartter syndrome is one of a growing number of diseases linked to the ERAD pathway and that the yeast ROMK1 expression system can be co-opted to elucidate the molecular defects associated with other ROMK1 mutants. To determine the molecular basis of Bartter disease-causing mutations in ROMK1, we initially took advantage of a well-established phenotypic assay in yeast. Budding yeast have a robust potassium uptake system, enabling them to grow on micromolar concentrations of the ion. The high-affinity potassium transporters Trk1 and Trk2 are central to this system, but yeast lacking these genes fail to propagate on relatively low (∼3–25 mm) potassium. However, heterologous expression of potassium channels from other organisms rescues the potassium-sensitive phenotype of trk1Δtrk2Δ yeast (57.Nakamura R.L. Gaber R.F. Studying ion channels using yeast genetics.Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and numerous studies have exploited this phenomenon to probe genetic interactions, identify small molecule modulators, and establish structure-function characteristics of diverse potassium channels (25.Kolb A.R.

Therefore, we expressed rat ROMK1 in trk1Δtrk2Δ yeast to assess whether growth on low potassium could be restored. Initial attempts to express ROMK1 in trk1Δtrk2Δ yeast failed to reveal growth rescue on low potassium media (see below and Fig. 2). This contrasts with the strong rescue phenotype observed in yeast expressing the inwardly rectifying channel Kir2.1 (25.Kolb A.R. Needham P.G. Rothenberg C. Guerriero C.J. Welling P.A. Brodsky J.L. ESCRT regulates surface expression of the Kir2.1 potassium channel.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2014; 25: 276-289Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which shares ∼40% sequence identity with ROMK1 (64.Sievers F. Wilm A. Dineen D. Gibson T.J. Karplus K. Li W. Lopez R. McWilliam H. Remmert M. Söding J. Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Fast, scalable generation of high-quality protein multiple sequence alignments using Clustal Omega.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2011; 7: 539Crossref PubMed Scopus (6946) Google Scholar). To remedy this problem, we made two targeted mutations in the ROMK1-encoding gene. First, ROMK1 contains an intracellular acid-sensitive gate, which keeps the channel closed under conditions of cellular acidification (65.Rapedius M. Fowler P.W. Shang L. Sansom M.S. Tucker S.J. Baukrowitz T. H bonding at the helix-bundle crossing controls gating in Kir potassium channels.Neuron. 2007; 55: 602-614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) but is absent in Kir2.1. We hypothesized that this pH gate closes ROMK because the yeast cytosol is acidic (pH 5.5–6.8) (66.Imai T. Ohno T. Measurement of yeast intracellular pH by image processing and the change it undergoes during growth phase.J Biotechnol. 1995; 38: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Therefore, Lys-80, which is crucial for pH gating (67.Sackin H. Nanazashvili M. Palmer L.G. Li H. Role of conserved glycines in pH gating of Kir1.1 (ROMK).Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 3582-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), was mutated to Met (K80M). Second, ROMK1 primarily resides in the ER in mammalian cells due to the presence of multiple RXR motifs at both the N- and C-terminal domains. Aldosterone-regulated phosphorylation at Ser-44 by SGK-1 overrides ER retention, promoting anterograde traffic (68.Yoo D. Fang L. Mason A. Kim B.Y. Welling P.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 23066-23075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). To favor ER exit in yeast, Ser-44 was mutated to Asp (S44D). Next, vectors engineered for the constitutive expression of ROMK1, each of the single mutants as well as the double mutant, were constructed and introduced into trk1Δtrk2Δ yeast as well as into a strain that our group has previously identified as deficient in a negative regulator of Kir2.1, trk1Δtrk2Δvps23Δ (25.Kolb A.R.

Interleukin-10 (IL-10) secretion and lymphocyte exhaustion are the main features of sepsis-induced immunosuppression. However, the relationship between IL-10 and the lymphocyte is still unclear. We investigated if IL-10/lymphocyte ratio (IL10LCR) were associated with mortality in severe septic patients. Methods Adult patients with severe sepsis admitted to ICU of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University were identified from October 2012 to August 2013. Within 24 hours of ICU admission, peripheral whole blood was collected for the measurement of IL-10 using commercial multiplex bead-based assay kits and determination of lymphocyte count from laboratory data. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Results A total of 63 severe sepsis patients were identified. There were 20 (32%) patients died within 28 days. IL10LCR in non-survival patients was significantly higher than survival patients (median (IQR) 36.78 (12.34–79.63) ng/ml2 versus 11.01(5.41–27.50) ng/ml2, P = 0.002). Correlation analysis showed that IL10LCR was significantly correlated with APACHE II score (Spearman’s rho = 0.424, P<0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed the area under the curve was 0.749 for IL10LCR level to predict 28-day mortality with sensitivity and specificity at 70.0% and 74.4%, respectively. At an optimal cutoff of 23.39ng/ml2, Kaplan-Meier curve showed survival in patients with IL10LCR level above 23.39ng/ml2 was significantly lower than in patients with IL10LCR level less than 23.39ng/ml2 (P = 0.001 by log-rank test). Conclusion IL10LCR level is significantly associated with the severity and outcome of severe septic patients. It may serve as a biomarker for sepsis-induced immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2713393684,"Pre-roost murmuration displays by European starlings Sturnus vulgaris are a spectacular example of collective animal behaviour. To date, empirical research has focussed largely on flock movement and biomechanics whereas research on possible causal mechanisms that affect flock size and murmuration duration has been limited and restricted to a small number of sites. Possible explanations for this behaviour include reducing predation through the dilution, detection or predator confusion effects (the “safer together” hypotheses) or recruiting more birds to create larger (warmer) roosts (the “warmer together” hypothesis). We collected data on size, duration, habitat, temperature and predators from >3,000 murmurations using citizen science. Sightings were submitted from 23 countries but UK records predominated. Murmurations occurred across a range of habitats but there was no association between habitat and size/duration. Size increased significantly from October to early February, followed by a decrease until the end of the season in March (overall mean 30,082 birds; maximum 750,000 birds). Mean duration was 26 minutes (± 44 seconds SEM). Displays were longest at the start/end of the season, probably due to a significant positive relationship with day length. Birds of prey were recorded at 29.6% of murmurations. The presence of predators including harrier Circus, peregrine Falco peregrinus, and sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus was positively correlated with murmuration size (R2 = 0.401) and duration (R2 = 0.258), especially when these species were flying near to, or actively engaging with, starlings. Temperature was negatively correlated with duration but the effect was much weaker than that of day length. When predators were present, murmurations were statistically more likely to end with all birds going down en masse to roost rather than dispersing from the site. Our findings suggest that starling murmurations are primarily an anti-predator adaptation rather than being undertaken to attract larger numbers of individuals to increase roost warmth."
https://openalex.org/W2625363962,"In the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) total tau (T-tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau181), and the 42 amino acid isoform of alpha β-amyloid (Aβ) are well established surrogate CSF markers. However, there is a constant need for new diagnostic markers to identify the disease at a very early stage. The identification of new molecules for AD diagnosis and monitoring in CSF is hampered by several ""confounding"" factors including intra- and inter-individual, pre-analytical and analytical variabilities. In an attempt to partially overcome patient's variability and to determine new molecules significantly dysregulated in CSF, we assessed the proteome profile of low molecular weight protein species in CSF and serum of the same patients. CSFs and sera from 36 ADs, 32 iNPHs (idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus) and 12 controls were compared by MALDI profiling (non-parametric statistics, CV<20%, AUC>0.750). After protein identification by mass spectrometry, the proteoform composition was assessed by 2-D DIGE/MS. Results indicated that CSF of iNPH can be used as control. Serum and CSF of AD patients shows a specific protein profile compared to iNPH samples. A variation (p<0.01) of Apo A-1 levels in AD, together with a specific dysregulation of Apo A-1 proteoforms was observed. The profiling of CSF and serum of the same patients, suggests that the decrement of total Apo A-1 occurs specifically in CSF. Serum and CSF of AD shows a characteristic Apo A-1 proteoform pattern suggesting it as potential marker which can support the clinical workflow adopted for AD diagnosis and progression."

Overall, 14.7% of respondents reported occasional and 4.2% intensive online-sex use. In multivariate analysis, online-sex use was significantly positively associated with male sex, younger age, unemployment and an anxious partner attachment pattern and negatively with conscientiousness and agreeableness.Arousal and satisfaction by virtual enactment of sexual phantasies may be attractive for anxiously attached persons who find it difficult to commit to a real life relationship due to fear of rejection or low self-esteem. More knowledge about the individual antecedents of intensive online-sex use may also be helpful for the development of consultation and treatment strategies for excessive and addictive online-sex use."

Objective To evaluate the impact of glycemic status on radiological findings of PTB in diabetic patients. Methods Between January 2010 and December 2015, chest radiographs (CXRs) in consecutive 214 DM patients with culture-proved PTB and 123 available thoracic computed tomography (CT) scans were enrolled. An equal number of non-DM patients with similar demographics was included as the control group. Glycemic status was assessed by glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and a cutoff of 8% was used to further investigate radiological features of diabetic PTB. Two radiologists and one pulmonologist reviewed the chest images independently. Results Compared with non-DM patients, primary PTB pattern and extensive disease on CXRs as well as primary PTB pattern, large non-cavitary nodule, more than one cavity in a single lesion, unusual location, and all lobe involvement of lesions on thoracic CT scans were more common in DM patients. Furthermore, diabetics with HbA1c > 8% were more likely to exhibit unusual findings (P < 0.001), far advanced extensive lesions (P < 0.001) on CXRs, lymphadenopathy (P = 0.028), more than one cavity in a single lesion (P < 0.001) and all lobe involvement (P = 0.041) on thoracic CT scans.

Given an increased risk of atypical radiological presentations of PTB in DM patients, physicians should be alert and pay more attention to those with poor glycemic control."
https://openalex.org/W2718565370,"To quantitatively investigate the characteristics of eyes with pituitary adenoma presented by three-dimensional (3D) spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) using three common indices, including thickness, optical intensity ratio, and optical intensity attenuation coefficient (OIAC).The SD-OCT database of 38 patients with pituitary adenoma and 39 normal controls were included in the study. Quadrantal and average measurements of thickness, optical intensity ratio, and OIAC were calculated for macular retinal nerve fiber layer (mRNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL) combined with inner plexiform layer (IPL) (GCIPL) and/or the collective ganglion cell complex (GCC). The parameters of patients and controls were compared by unpaired t-test and Mann-Whitney U-test. The relationships between the optical intensity ratio and the thickness of mRNFL and GCIPL were evaluated by Pearson's correlation. Diagnostic performances of these indices were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Significant decreases in thickness existed in the mRNFL and nasal GCC of patients compared with controls (p-values of 0.000 to 0.039). Optical intensity ratios in the relevant retinal layers of patients were almost all lower than those of controls. In patients, optical intensities were increased in the mRNFL but decreased in the GCIPL along with an increase of retinal thicknesses. The OIAC measurements were significantly higher in the upper quadrants and global average of the mRNFL in patients. The areas under the ROC curves (AUC) obtained by global average mRNFL thickness was significantly greater than that of the global average OIAC in the mRNFL (p = 0.0265).Thicknesses of the mRNFL and nasal GCC were significantly decreased in the retinas of patients with pituitary adenoma compared with controls. The differences of the optical intensity ratio and OIAC between patients and controls were not all statistically significant. Thickness was more sensitive than optical characteristics indices in distinguishing pituitary adenoma from controls."
https://openalex.org/W2671945830,"Constant exposure to moderate heat facilitates progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation in the hypothalamus of heat-acclimated (HA) rats. In this study, we investigated neural phenotype and responsiveness to heat in HA rats’ hypothalamic newborn cells. Additionally, the effect of hypothalamic neurogenesis on heat acclimation in rats was evaluated. Male Wistar rats (5 weeks old) were housed at an ambient temperature (Ta) of 32°C for 6 days (STHA) or 40 days (LTHA), while control (CN) rats were kept at a Ta of 24°C for 6 days (STCN) or 40 days (LTCN). Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was intraperitoneally injected daily for five consecutive days (50 mg/kg/day) after commencing heat exposure. The number of hypothalamic BrdU-immunopositive (BrdU+) cells in STHA and LTHA rats was determined immunohistochemically in brain samples and found to be significantly greater than those in respective CN groups. In LTHA rats, approximately 32.6% of BrdU+ cells in the preoptic area (POA) of the anterior hypothalamus were stained by GAD67, a GABAergic neuron marker, and 15.2% of BrdU+ cells were stained by the glutamate transporter, a glutamatergic neuron marker. In addition, 63.2% of BrdU+ cells in the POA were immunolabeled with c-Fos. Intracerebral administration of the mitosis inhibitor, cytosine arabinoside (AraC), interfered with the proliferation of neural progenitor cells and acquired heat tolerance in LTHA rats, whereas the selected ambient temperature was not changed. These results demonstrate that heat exposure generates heat responsive neurons in the POA, suggesting a pivotal role in autonomic thermoregulation in long-term heat-acclimated rats."
https://openalex.org/W2710384694,"Introduction In the last decade microRNAs (miRNAs) have been widely investigated in prostate cancer (PCa) and have shown to be promising biomarkers in diagnostic, prognostic and predictive settings. However, tumor heterogeneity may influence miRNA expression. The aims of this study were to assess the impact of tumor heterogeneity, as demonstrated by a panel of selected miRNAs in PCa, and to correlate miRNA expression with risk profile and patient outcome. Material and methods Prostatectomy specimens and matched, preoperative needle biopsies from a retrospective cohort of 49 patients, who underwent curatively intended surgery for localized PCa, were investigated with a panel of 6 miRNAs (miRNA-21, miRNA-34a, miRNA-125b, miRNA-126, miRNA-143, and miRNA-145) using tissue micro-array (TMA) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Inter- and intra-patient variation was assessed using intra-class correlation (ICC). Results Four miRNAs (miRNA-21, miRNA-34a, miRNA-125, and miRNA-126) were significantly upregulated in PCa compared to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and except for miRNA-21 these miRNAs documented a positive correlation between the expression level in PCa cores and their matched BPH cores, (r > 0.72). The ICC varied from 0.451 to 0.764, with miRNA-34a showing an intra-tumoral heterogeneity accounting for less than 50% of the total variation. Regarding clinicopathological outcomes, only miRNA-143 showed potential as a prognostic marker with a higher expression correlating with longer relapse-free survival (p = 0.016). Conclusion The present study documents significant upregulation of the expression of miRNA-21, miRNA-34a, miRNA-125, and miRNA-126 in PCa compared to BPH and suggests a possible prognostic value associated with the expression of miRNA-143. The results, however, document intra-tumoral heterogeneity in the expression of various miRNAs calling for caution when using these tumor tissue biomarkers in prognostic and predictive settings."
https://openalex.org/W2708943350,"Background Exposure to soybean allergens has been linked to asthma outbreaks. Exposure to diesel exhaust particles (DEP) has been associated with an increase in the risk of asthma and asthma exacerbation; however, in both cases the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood, as does the possible interaction between the two entities. Objective To investigate how the combination of soybean allergens and DEP can affect the induction or exacerbation of asthma in a murine model. Methods BALB/c mice received intranasal instillations of saline, 3 or 5 mg protein/ml soybean hull extract (SHE), or a combination of one of these three solutions with DEP. Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), pulmonary inflammation in bronchoalveolar lavage, total serum immunoglobulin E and histological studies were assessed. Results A 5 mg protein/ml SHE solution was able by itself to enhance AHR (p = 0.0033), increase eosinophilic inflammation (p = 0.0003), increase levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F and CCL20, and reduce levels of IFN-γ. The combination of 5 mg protein/ml SHE with DEP also produced an increase in AHR and eosinophilic inflammation, but presented a slightly different cytokine profile with higher levels of Th17-related cytokines. However, while the 3 mg protein/ml SHE solution did not induce asthma, co-exposure with DEP resulted in a markedly enhanced AHR (p = 0.002) and eosinophilic inflammation (p = 0.004), with increased levels of IL-5, IL-17F and CCL20 and decreased levels of IFN-γ. Conclusions & clinical relevance The combination of soybean allergens and DEP is capable of triggering an asthmatic response through a Th17-related mechanism when the soybean allergen concentration is too low to promote a response by itself. DEP monitoring may be a useful addition to allergen monitoring in order to prevent new asthma outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W2646300815,"Feature extraction for Acoustic Bird Species Classification (ABSC) tasks has traditionally been based on parametric representations that were specifically developed for speech signals, such as Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC). However, the discrimination capabilities of these features for ABSC could be enhanced by accounting for the vocal production mechanisms of birds, and, in particular, the spectro-temporal structure of bird sounds. In this paper, a new front-end for ABSC is proposed that incorporates this specific information through the non-negative decomposition of bird sound spectrograms. It consists of the following two different stages: short-time feature extraction and temporal feature integration. In the first stage, which aims at providing a better spectral representation of bird sounds on a frame-by-frame basis, two methods are evaluated. In the first method, cepstral-like features (NMF_CC) are extracted by using a filter bank that is automatically learned by means of the application of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) on bird audio spectrograms. In the second method, the features are directly derived from the activation coefficients of the spectrogram decomposition as performed through NMF (H_CC). The second stage summarizes the most relevant information contained in the short-time features by computing several statistical measures over long segments. The experiments show that the use of NMF_CC and H_CC in conjunction with temporal integration significantly improves the performance of a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based ABSC system with respect to conventional MFCC."
https://openalex.org/W2704162737,"Objectives To investigate whether patients with normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) have a higher incidence of stroke. Design A population-based retrospective cohort study based on data from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2010. Methods Data were retrospectively collected from the NHIRD. A total of 245 (20.1%) patients with a history of stroke at the time of glaucoma diagnosis were excluded, and 1,218 patients with NTG who were 20 years of age and older were identified. Patients’ age, gender and pre-existing comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes, congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation and disorders of lipid metabolism, were recorded. The propensity score method with a 1:5 matching ratio was used to minimize selection bias. Cox regression with robust variance estimation was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of developing stroke between the NTG and control groups. Results After adjusting for patient age, gender, and pre-existing comorbidities, the HR was 6.34, indicating that the incidence of stroke was significantly higher in patients with NTG than in controls. Furthermore, a higher risk of stroke was also found in most subgroups with the above-mentioned comorbidities. Conclusion NTG is a significant risk factor for subsequent stroke in most of the described comorbidity subgroups. Early interventions for stroke prevention should be provided to newly diagnosed patients with NTG."

During October 1, 2006-June 30, 2014, China expanded MDR-TB care through a partnership with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria (Global Fund). We analyzed data on site expansion, patient enrolment, treatment outcomes, cost per patient, and overall programme expenditure. China expanded MDR-TB diagnostic and treatment services from 2 prefectures in 2006 to 92 prefectures, covering 921 of the country's 3,000 counties by June 2014. A total of 130,910 patients were tested for MDR-TB, resulting in 13,744 laboratory-confirmed cases, and 9,183 patients started on MDR-TB treatment. Treatment success was 48.4% (2011 cohort). The partnership between China and the Global Fund resulted in enormous gains. However, changes to health system TB delivery and financing coincided with the completion of the Global Fund Programme, and could potentially impact TB and MDR-TB control. Transition to full country financial ownership is proving difficult, with a decline in enrollment and insufficient financial coverage. Given needed improvement to the current treatment success rates, these factors jeopardise investments made for MDR-TB control and care. China now has a chance to cement its status in TB control by strengthening future financing and ensuring ongoing commitment to quality service delivery."
https://openalex.org/W2659623895,"To elucidate the etiology of type 1 diabetes, the affected pancreas needs to be thoroughly characterized. Pancreatic innervation has been suggested to be involved in the pathology of the disease and a reduction of sympathetic innervation of the islets was recently reported. In the present study, we hypothesized that parasympathetic innervation would be altered in the type 1 diabetes pancreas. Human pancreatic specimens were obtained from a unique cohort of individuals with recent onset or long standing type 1 diabetes. Density of parasympathetic axons was assessed by immunofluorescence and morphometry. Our main finding was a reduced density of parasympathetic axons in the exocrine, but not endocrine compartment of the pancreas in individuals with recent onset type 1 diabetes. The reduced density of parasympathetic axons in the exocrine compartment could have functional implications, e.g. be related to the exocrine insufficiency reported in type 1 diabetes patients. Further studies are needed to understand whether reduced parasympathetic innervation is a cause or consequence of type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2665699568,"Background Systolic left ventricular function strongly influences the blood pressure waveform. Therefore, pressure-derived parameters might potentially be used as non-invasive, diagnostic markers of left ventricular impairment. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of pressure-based parameters in combination with electrocardiography (ECG) for the detection of left ventricular systolic dysfunction defined as severely reduced ejection fraction (EF). Methods and results Two populations, each comprising patients with reduced EF and pressure-matched controls, were included for the main analysis (51/102 patients) and model testing (44/88 patients). Central pressure was derived from radial readings and used to compute blood flow. Subsequently, pulse wave analysis and wave intensity analysis were performed and the ratio of the two peaks of forward intensity (SDR) was calculated as a novel index of ventricular function. SDR was significantly decreased in the reduced EF group (2.5 vs. 4.4, P<0.001), as was central pulse pressure, augmentation index and ejection duration (ED), while the QRS-duration was prolonged. SDR and ED were independent predictors of ventricular impairment and when combined with QRS in a simple decision tree, a reduced EF could be detected with a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 80%. The independent power of ED, SDR and QRS to predict reduced EF was furthermore confirmed in the test population. Conclusion The detection or indication of reduced ejection fraction from pressure-derived parameters seems feasible. These parameters could help to improve the quality of cardiovascular risk stratification or might be used in screening strategies in the general population."
https://openalex.org/W2632178812,"The incidence of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Albania is higher than in other countries of southern Europe, however the role of local sand fly species in the transmission of Leishmania infantum was not addressed conclusively. In 2006, a country-wide collection of sand flies performed in 14 sites selected based on recent occurrence of VL cases showed that Phlebotomus neglectus was by far the most prevalent species (95.6%). Furthermore, 15% of pools made from 422 P. neglectus females tested positive for Leishmania sp. genomic DNA. In the same year, Culicoides trapping was performed for bluetongue disease surveillance in 91 sites of southern Albania, targeting livestock farms regardless recent occurrence of VL in the surveyed areas. In 35 sites where sand flies were collected along with midges, Phlebotomus perfiliewi was the most prevalent among the Phlebotomus species identified, however search for leishmanial DNA in females of this species was unsuccessful. In 2011, sand flies were trapped in 4 sites of north Albania characterized by high VL incidence, and females were dissected to search for Leishmania infections. Both P. neglectus and P. tobbi were collected at high densities. Two positive specimens were detected from a sample of 64 P. neglectus trapped in one site (3.1%). Parasites were successfully cultured from one specimen and characterized as belonging to Leishmania infantum zymodeme MON-1, the only zymodeme so far identified as the agent of human and canine leishmaniasis in the country. Altogether our studies indicate that P. neglectus is the main leishmaniasis vector in Albania."
https://openalex.org/W2636185829,"Background Weight-change across parities and/or current BMI may influence maternal and fetal morbidity and requires to be differentiated to better inform weight-management guidance. Methods Direction, pattern and magnitude of weight-change across three consecutive parities and thereby two inter-pregnancy periods was described in 5079 women. The association between inter-pregnancy weight-change versus current BMI and adverse maternal events, SGA-birth and preterm delivery at second and third pregnancy were investigated by logistic regression. Results More women gained weight across the defined childbearing period than lost it, with ~35% of normal and overweight women gaining sufficient weight to move up a BMI-category. Nine patterns of weight-change were defined across two inter-pregnancy periods and 50% of women remained weight-stable throughout (within 2BMI units/period). Women who were overweight/obese at first pregnancy had higher risk of substantial weight-gain and loss (>10kg) during each of two inter-pregnancy periods. Inter-pregnancy weight-gain (> 2BMI units) between first and second pregnancy increased the risk of maternal morbidity (1or more event of hypertensive disease, caesarean-section, thromboembolism) at second pregnancy, while weight-loss (>2BMI units) increased the risk of SGA-birth. Similarly, increased risk of maternal morbidity at the third pregnancy was influenced by weight-gain during both inter-pregnancy periods but not by current BMI-category. Both weight-gain between first and second pregnancy, and being overweight/obese by third pregnancy protected the fetus against SGA-birth whereas weight-loss between second and third pregnancy doubled the SGA risk. Conclusion Half the women studied exhibited significant weight-fluctuations. This influenced their risk of maternal morbidity and SGA-birth at second and third pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W2627672251,"The Brazilian AIDS epidemic has been characterized by an increasing rate of BF1 recombinants and so far eight circulating recombinant forms/CRFs_BF1 have been described countrywide. In this study, pol sequences (protease/PR, reverse transcriptase/RT) of 87 BF1 mosaic isolates identified among 828 patients living in six Brazilian States from three geographic regions (Central West, North, Northeast) were analyzed. Phylogenetic and bootscan analyses were performed to investigate the evolutionary relationship and mosaic structure of BF1 isolates. Those analyses showed that 20.7% of mosaics (18 out of 87) were CRFs-like isolates, mostly represented by CRF28/CRF29_BF-like viruses (14 out of 18). We also identified five highly supported clusters that together comprise 42 out of 87 (48.3%) BF1 sequences, each cluster containing at least five sequences sharing a similar mosaic structure, suggesting possible new unidentified CRFs_BF1. The divergence time of these five potential new CRFs_BF1 clusters was estimated using a Bayesian approach and indicate that they probably originated between the middle 1980s and the middle 1990s. DNA was extracted from whole blood and four overlapping fragments were amplified by PCR providing full/near full length genomes (FLG/NFLG) and partial genomes. Eleven HIV-1 isolates from Cluster # 5 identified in epidemiologically unlinked individuals living in Central West and North regions provided FLG/NFLG/partial genome sequences with identical mosaic structure. These viruses differ from any known CRF_BF1 reported to date and were named CRF90_BF1 by the Los Alamos National Laboratory. This is the 9th CRF_BF1 described in Brazil and the first one identified in Central West and North regions. Our results highlight the importance of continued molecular screening and surveillance studies, especially of full genome sequences to understand the evolutionary dynamics of the HIV-1 epidemic in a country of continental dimensions as Brazil."
https://openalex.org/W2670295665,"While widespread transcriptome changes were previously observed with seed dormancy loss, this study specifically characterized transcriptional changes associated with the increased seed dormancy and dormancy loss of the gibberellin (GA) hormone-insensitive sleepy1-2 (sly1-2) mutant. The SLY1 gene encodes the F-box subunit of an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase needed for GA-triggered proteolysis of DELLA repressors of seed germination. DELLA overaccumulation in sly1-2 seeds leads to increased dormancy that can be rescued without DELLA protein destruction either by overexpression of the GA receptor, GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF1b (GID1b-OE) (74% germination) or by extended dry after-ripening (11 months, 51% germination). After-ripening of sly1 resulted in different transcriptional changes in early versus late Phase II of germination that were consistent with the processes known to occur. Approximately half of the transcriptome changes with after-ripening appear to depend on SLY1-triggered DELLA proteolysis. Given that many of these SLY1/GA-dependent changes are genes involved in protein translation, it appears that GA signaling increases germination capacity in part by activating translation. While sly1-2 after-ripening was associated with transcript-level changes in 4594 genes over two imbibition timepoints, rescue of sly1-2 germination by GID1b-OE was associated with changes in only 23 genes. Thus, a big change in sly1-2 germination phenotype can occur with relatively little change in the global pattern of gene expression during the process of germination. Most GID1b-OE-responsive transcripts showed similar changes with after-ripening in early Phase II of imbibition, but opposite changes with after-ripening by late Phase II. This suggests that GID1b-OE stimulates germination early in imbibition, but may later trigger negative feedback regulation."

Materials and methods Our institutional review board approved this prospective study, and all patients provided written informed consent. Among 1840 ultrasound-guided percutaneous biopsies performed from August 2013 to December 2014, 145 non-mass breast lesions with suspicious microcalcifications on mammography or corresponding magnetic resonance imaging finding were subjected to 13-gauge VAB or 14-gauge CCNB. We evaluated the technical success rates, average specimen numbers, and tissue sampling time. We also compared the results of percutaneous biopsy and final surgical pathologic diagnosis to analyze the rates of diagnostic upgrade or downgrade. Results Ultrasound-guided VAB successfully targeted and sampled all lesions, whereas CCNB failed to demonstrate calcification in four (10.3%) breast lesions with microcalcification on specimen mammography. The mean sampling time were 238.6 and 170.6 seconds for VAB and CCNB, respectively. No major complications were observed with either method. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) lesions were more frequently upgraded after CCNB (8/23 and 3/5, respectively) than after VAB (2/26 and 0/4, respectively P = 0.028). Conclusion Non-mass breast lesions were successfully and accurately biopsied using cable-free VAB. The underestimation rate of ultrasound-detected non-mass lesion was significantly lower with VAB than with CCNB. Trial registration CRiS KCT0002267."
https://openalex.org/W2683959215,"Over the course of a year, more than 20,000 patients in Taiwan require prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV). Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database for patients between 2005 and 2011 were used to conduct a retrospective analysis on ventilator dependence. The study subjects were PMV patients aged <17 years in Taiwan. A multiple regression model employing general estimating equations was applied to investigate the factors affecting the use of medical resources by children and adolescent PMV patients. A Cox proportional hazard model was incorporated to explore the factors affecting the survival of these patients. Data were collected for a total of 1,019 children and adolescent PMV patients in Taiwan. The results revealed that the average number of outpatient visits per subject was 32.1 times per year, whereas emergency treatments averaged 1.56 times per year per subject and hospitalizations averaged 160.8 days per year per subject. Regarding average annual medical costs, hospitalizations accounted for the largest portion at NT$821,703 per year per subject, followed by outpatient care at NT$123,136 per year per subject and emergency care at NT$3,806 per year per subject. The demographic results indicated that the patients were predominately male (61.24%), with those under 1 year of age accounting for the highest percentage (36.38%). According to the Kaplan—Meier curve, the 1-year and 5-year mortality rates of the patients were approximately 32% and 47%, respectively. The following factors affecting the survival rate were considered: age, the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), diagnosis type necessitating ventilator use, and whether an invasive ventilator was used. This study investigated the use of medical resources and the survival rates of children and adolescent PMV patients. The findings of this study can serve as a reference for the National Health Insurance Administration in promoting its future integrated pilot projects on ventilator dependency."
https://openalex.org/W2689875962,"Selecting parents and evaluating progenies is a very important step in breeding programs and involves approaches such as understanding the initial stages of growth and characterizing the variability among genotypes for different parameters, such as physiological, growth, biomass partitioning and nutrient translocation to the aerial part. In these cases, facilitating tools can be used to understand the involved gene dynamics, such as diallel crosses and genetic and phenotypic correlations. Our main hypothesis is that the contrasting phenotypes of these parental genotypes of cocoa used are due to genetic factors, and progenies derived from crosses of these parental genotypes are useful for breeding programs related to plant architecture, physiological parameters and translocation of mineral nutrients. We aimed to evaluate the combining abilities in progenies of cacao (Theobroma cacao L) originating from contrasting parents for canopy vigor. Emphasis was given to the evaluation of morphological and physiological parameters and the phenotypic and genotypic correlations to understand the dynamics of the action of the genes involved, as well as in expression profile from genes of gibberellins biosynthesis pathway in the parents. Fifteen F1 progenies were obtained from crosses of six clones (IMC 67, P4B, PUCALA, SCA 6, SCA 24 and SJ 02) that were evaluated in a randomized complete block design with four replicates of 12 plants per progeny, in a balanced half table diallel scheme. It is possible to identify and select plants and progenies of low, medium and high height, as there is expressive genetic variability for the evaluated parameters, some of these on higher additive effects, others on larger nonadditive effects and others under a balance of these effects. Most physiological parameters evaluated show that for selection of plants with the desired performance, no complex breeding methods would be necessary due to the high and medium heritability observed. Strong genetic components were observed from many of the correlations, which indicate the possibility to formulate selection indices for multi-traits, such as dwarfism or semidwarfism, tolerance to increase of leaf sodium concentrations and maintenance of the photosynthetic apparatus integrity under these conditions. Additionally, plants with higher carbon fixation, better water use, higher carboxylation efficiency and greater magnesium accumulation in leaves can be selected."
https://openalex.org/W2709681324,"Human anaplasmosis (HA) is an emerging tick-borne disease that may present as a mild flu-like illness or a life threatening, sepsis-like condition. Although disease severity is hypothesized to relate to immunopathology and immune dysfunction in humans, studies to directly measure immune responses in infected humans have been very limited. We quantified cytokines in 80 confirmed HA patients using a multiplex chemiluminescence immunoassay system and compared similarly measured responses in 1000 control subjects. Pro-inflammatory cytokines were significantly elevated in HA patients (all seven p<0.0001). Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) concentrations were particularly high, with average concentrations 7.8 times higher in the HA patients than the controls. A subset of cytokines consisting of IL-1β, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-10 was also coordinately high and significantly associated with severity of thrombocytopenia in HA patients. Patients with infections in the very acute stage (≤ 4 days ill) tended to have the highest IFN-γ, IL-12p70, and IL-2 levels. Higher concentrations of IL-13 and IL-5 were associated with diarrhea and vomiting. Our findings support a pathophysiological role for a pro-inflammatory response in HA, especially with regard to the modulation of hematopoiesis and subsequent hematopoietic complications."
https://openalex.org/W2646393821,"Pulmonary dendritic cells drive lung responses to foreign antigens, including Saccharopolyspora rectivirgula, a causative agent of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. While the airway inflammatory mechanisms involved in hypersensitivity pneumonitis are well described, the mechanisms leading to the break in homeostasis and hypersensitivity pneumonitis onset are not well-described, and could involve CD103+ dendritic cells, which are found at baseline and during inflammatory responses in the lung. However, recent demonstration of the ability of CD103+ dendritic cells to induce inflammatory responses starkly contrasts with their classically described role as regulatory cells. These discrepancies may be attributable to the lack of current information on the importance of CD103 expression and modulation on these cells during inflammatory episodes.To verify the importance of CD103 expression in the regulation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, wild-type and Cd103-/- mice were exposed intranasally to S. rectivirgula and airway inflammation was quantified. Surface expression of CD103 in response to S. rectivirgula exposure was studied and cell transfers were used to determine the relative importance of CD103 expression on dendritic cells and T cells in regulating the inflammation in hypersensitivity pneumonitis.Cd103-/- mice developed an exacerbated inflammatory response as early as 18h following S. rectivirgula exposure. CD103 expression on dendritic cells was downregulated quickly following S. rectivirgula exposure, and cell transfers demonstrated that CD103 expression on dendritic cells specifically (and not T cells) regulates the onset and severity of this response.All in all, we demonstrate that CD103 expression by dendritic cells, but not T cells, is crucial for homeostasis maintenance and the regulation of the TH17 airway inflammatory response in hypersensitivity pneumonitis."
https://openalex.org/W2651760723,"We evaluated effect of horizontal rectus surgery on sub-A or sub-V pattern intermittent exotropia. We enrolled patients with sub-A or sub-V pattern intermittent exotropia. The sub-A pattern was diagnosed when the eyes diverged less than 10 prism diopters (PD) from upgaze to downgaze, and sub-V pattern when the divergence was 14 PD or less from downgaze to upgaze. Patients had undergone horizontal rectus surgery without vertical transposition of horizontal rectus muscle or oblique muscle weakening. The patients were divided into two groups: sub-A pattern (group A) and sub-V pattern (group V). The outcome measures were change of amount of pattern and rate of collapse of pattern postoperatively. The amount of pattern (vertical incomitance) was amount of difference in exodeviation between upgaze and downgaze. Collapse of pattern was defined as disappearance of difference in exodeviation between upgaze and downgaze. In groups A and V, preoperative amounts of pattern were 4.9 PD and 6.8 PD, respectively. A significant reduction in amount of pattern was observed in both groups throughout the follow-up period (p<0.05). At postoperative 6 months, the amounts of pattern were 1.0 PD and 1.2 PD and the extents of reduction in amount of pattern were 4.4 PD and 5.9 PD. The rates of collapse of pattern at postoperative 6 months were 77.8 and 60.0%, respectively. In the patients with sub-A or sub-V pattern exotropia, horizontal rectus surgery without vertical transposition or oblique muscle weakening can successfully collapse the pattern."
https://openalex.org/W2657047917,"The rising tide of sepsis, a leading cause of death in the US and globally, is not adequately controlled by current antimicrobial therapies and supportive measures, thereby requiring new adjunctive treatments. Severe microvascular injury and multiple organ failure in sepsis are attributed to a ""genomic storm"" resulting from changes in microbial and host genomes encoding virulence factors and endogenous inflammatory mediators, respectively. This storm is mediated by stress-responsive transcription factors that are ferried to the nucleus by nuclear transport shuttles importins/karyopherins. We studied the impact of simultaneously targeting two of these shuttles, importin alpha 5 (Imp α5) and importin beta 1 (Imp β1), with a cell-penetrating Nuclear Transport Modifier (NTM) in a mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis. NTM reduced nuclear import of stress-responsive transcription factors nuclear factor kappa B, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 alpha, and activator protein 1 in liver, which was also protected from sepsis-associated metabolic changes. Strikingly, NTM without antimicrobial therapy improved bacterial clearance in blood, spleen, and lungs, wherein a 700-fold reduction in bacterial burden was achieved while production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in blood plasma was suppressed. Furthermore, NTM significantly improved thrombocytopenia, a prominent sign of microvascular injury in sepsis, inhibited neutrophil infiltration in the liver, decreased L-selectin, and normalized plasma levels of E-selectin and P-selectin, indicating reduced microvascular injury. Importantly, NTM combined with antimicrobial therapy extended the median time to death from 42 to 83 hours and increased survival from 30% to 55% (p = 0.022) as compared to antimicrobial therapy alone. This study documents the fundamental role of nuclear signaling mediated by Imp α5 and Imp β1 in the mechanism of polymicrobial sepsis and highlights the potential for targeting nuclear transport as an adjunctive therapy in sepsis management."
https://openalex.org/W2671703654,"The beneficial effects of bioidentical ovarian steroid hormone therapy (HT) during the perimenopause are gaining recognition. However, the positive effects of estrogen (E) plus or minus progesterone (P) administration to ovariectomized (Ovx) lab animals were recognized in multiple systems for years before clinical trials could adequately duplicate the results. Moreover, very large numbers of women are often needed to find statistically significant results in clinical trials of HT; and there are still opposing results being published, especially in neural and cardiovascular systems. One of the obvious differences between human and animal studies is diet. Laboratory animals are fed a diet that is low in fat and refined sugar, but high in micronutrients. In the US, a large portion of the population eats what is known as a ""western style diet"" or WSD that provides calories from 36% fat, 44% carbohydrates (includes 18.5% sugars) and 18% protein. Unfortunately, obesity and diabetes have reached epidemic proportions and the percentage of obese women in clinical trials may be overlooked. We questioned whether WSD and obesity could decrease the positive neural effects of estradiol (E) in the serotonin system of old macaques that were surgically menopausal. Old ovo-hysterectomized female monkeys were fed WSD for 2.5 years, and treated with placebo, Immediate E (ImE) or Delayed E (DE). Compared to old Ovx macaques on primate chow and treated with placebo or E, the WSD-fed monkeys exhibited greater individual variance and blunted responses to E-treatment in the expression of genes related to serotonin neurotransmission, CRH components in the midbrain, synapse assembly, DNA repair, protein folding, ubiquitylation, transport and neurodegeneration. For many of the genes examined, transcript abundance was lower in WSD-fed than chow-fed monkeys. In summary, an obesogenic diet for 2.5 years in old surgically menopausal macaques blunted or increased variability in E-induced gene expression in the dorsal raphe. These results suggest that with regard to function and viability in the dorsal raphe, HT may not be as beneficial for obese women as normal weight women."

To overcome the hurdles of sub-optimal disease surveillance reporting from the health facilities to relevant authorities, the Ministry of Health in Kenya piloted mSOS (mobile SMS-based disease outbreak alert system) in 2013-2014. In this paper, we report the results of the qualitative study, which examined factors that influence the performances of mSOS implementation. In-depth interviews were conducted with 11 disease surveillance coordinators and 32 in-charges of rural health facilities that took part in the mSOS intervention. Drawing from the framework analysis, dominant themes that emerged from the interviews are presented. All participants voiced their excitement in using mSOS. The results showed that the technology was well accepted, easy to use, and both health workers and managers unanimously recommended the scale-up of the system despite challenges encountered in the implementation processes. The most challenging components were the context in which mSOS was implemented, including the lack of strong existing structure for continuous support supervision, feedback and response action related to disease surveillance. The study revealed broader health systems issues that should be addressed prior to and during the intervention scale-up."
https://openalex.org/W2686219636,"Background Intracoronary infusion of autologous bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BMMNC), after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), has been shown to improve myocardial function. However, therapeutic efficacy is limited, possibly because cell retention rates are low, suggesting that optimization of cell retention might increase therapeutic efficacy. Since retention of injected BMMNC is observed only within infarcted, but not remote, myocardium, we hypothesized that adhesion molecules on activated endothelium following reperfusion are essential. Consequently, we investigated the role of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) in BMMNC retention in swine undergoing reperfused AMI produced by 120 min of percutaneous left circumflex coronary occlusion. Methods and results VCAM-1 expression in the infarct and remote region was quantified at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 35 days, post-reperfusion (n≥6 swine per group). Since expression levels were significantly higher at 3 days (2.41±0.62%) than at 7 days (0.98±0.28%; p<0.05), we compared the degree of cell retention at those time points in a follow-up study, in which an average of 43·106 autologous BMMNCs were infused intracoronary at 3, or 7 days, post-reperfusion (n = 6 swine per group) and retention was histologically quantified one hour after intracoronary infusion of autologous BMMNCs. Although VCAM-1 expression correlated with retention of BMMNC within each time point, overall BMMNC retention was similar at day 3 and day 7 (2.3±1.3% vs. 3.1±1.4%, p = 0.72). This was not due to the composition of infused bone marrow cell fractions (analyzed with flow cytometry; n = 5 per group), as cell composition of the infused BMMNC fractions was similar. Conclusion These findings suggest that VCAM-1 expression influences to a small degree, but is not the principal determinant of, BMMNC retention."
https://openalex.org/W2721655047,"This article builds on the premise that human consumption of goods, food and transport are the ultimate drivers of climate change. However, the nature of the climate change problem (well described as a tragedy of the commons) makes it difficult for individuals to recognise their personal duty to implement behavioural changes to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, this article aims to analyse the climate change issue from a human-scale perspective, in which each of us has a clearly defined personal quota of CO2 emissions that limits our activity and there is a finite time during which CO2 emissions must be eliminated to achieve the ""well below 2°C"" warming limit set by the Paris Agreement of 2015 (COP21). Thus, this work's primary contribution is to connect an equal per capita fairness approach to a global carbon budget, linking personal levels with planetary levels. Here, we show that a personal quota of 5.0 tons of CO2 yr-1 p-1 is a representative value for both past and future emissions; for this level of a constant per-capita emissions and without considering any mitigation, the global accumulated emissions compatible with the ""well below 2°C"" and 2°C targets will be exhausted by 2030 and 2050, respectively. These are references years that provide an order of magnitude of the time that is left to reverse the global warming trend. More realistic scenarios that consider a smooth transition toward a zero-emission world show that the global accumulated emissions compatible with the ""well below 2°C"" and 2°C targets will be exhausted by 2040 and 2080, respectively. Implications of this paper include a return to personal responsibility following equity principles among individuals, and a definition of boundaries to the personal emissions of CO2."
https://openalex.org/W2696357186,"Lipoyl(Octanoyl) Transferase 2 (LIPT2) is a protein involved in the post-translational modification of key energy metabolism enzymes in humans. Defects of lipoic acid synthesis and transfer start to emerge as causes of fatal or severe early-onset disease. We show that the first 31 amino acids of the N-terminus of LIPT2 represent a mitochondrial targeting sequence and inhibition of the transit of LIPT2 to the mitochondrion results in apoptotic cell death associated with activation of the apoptotic volume decrease (AVD) current in normotonic conditions, as well as over-activation of the swelling-activated chloride current (IClswell), mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, caspase-3 cleavage and nuclear DNA fragmentation. The findings presented here may help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying derangements of lipoic acid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2629691120,"Lupus is characterized by a loss of B cell tolerance leading to autoantibody production. In this study, we explored the mechanisms underlying this loss of tolerance using B6 congenic mice with an interval from New Zealand Black chromosome 1 (denoted c1(96-100)) sufficient for anti-nuclear antibody production. Transgenes for soluble hen egg white lysozyme (sHEL) and anti-HEL immunoglobulin were crossed onto this background and various tolerance mechanisms examined. We found that c1(96-100) mice produced increased levels of IgM and IgG anti-HEL antibodies compared to B6 mice and had higher proportions of germinal center B cells and long-lived plasma cells, suggesting a germinal center-dependent breach of B cell anergy. Consistent with impaired anergy induction, c1(96-100) double transgenic B cells showed enhanced survival and CD86 upregulation. Hematopoietic chimeric sHEL mice with a mixture of B6 and c1(96-100) HEL transgenic B cells recapitulated these results, suggesting the presence of a B cell autonomous defect. Surprisingly, however, there was equivalent recruitment of B6 and c1(96-100) B cells into germinal centers and differentiation to splenic plasmablasts in these mice. In contrast, there were increased proportions of c1(96-100) T follicular helper cells and long-lived plasma cells as compared to their B6 counterparts, suggesting that both B and T cell defects are required to breach germinal center tolerance in this model. This possibility was further supported by experiments showing an enhanced breach of anergy in double transgenic mice with a longer chromosome 1 interval with additional T cell defects."
https://openalex.org/W2667918582,"HIV persists because a reservoir of latently infected CD4 T cells do not express viral proteins and are indistinguishable from uninfected cells. One approach to HIV cure suggests that reactivating HIV will activate cytotoxic pathways; yet when tested in vivo, reactivating cells do not die sufficiently to reduce cell-associated HIV DNA levels. We recently showed that following reactivation from latency, HIV infected cells generate the HIV specific cytotoxic protein Casp8p41 which is produced by HIV protease cleaving procaspase 8. However, cell death is prevented, possibly due to low procaspase 8 expression. Here, we tested whether increasing procaspase 8 levels in CD4 T cells will produce more Casp8p41 following HIV reactivation, causing more reactivated cells to die. Screening 1277 FDA approved drugs identified 168 that increased procaspase 8 expression by at least 1.7-fold. Of these 30 were tested for anti-HIV effects in an acute HIVIIIb infection model, and 9 drugs at physiologic relevant levels significantly reduced cell-associated HIV DNA. Primary CD4 T cells from ART suppressed HIV patients were treated with one of these 9 drugs and reactivated with αCD3/αCD28. Four drugs significantly increased Casp8p41 levels following HIV reactivation, and decreased total cell associated HIV DNA levels (flurbiprofen: p = 0.014; doxycycline: p = 0.044; indomethacin: p = 0.025; bezafibrate: P = 0.018) without effecting the viability of uninfected cells. Thus procaspase 8 levels can be increased pharmacologically and, in the context of HIV reactivation, increase Casp8p41 causing death of reactivating cells and decreased HIV DNA levels. Future studies will be required to define the clinical utility of this or similar approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2700623028,"Orally administered vaccine bacteria usually persist for a period of time in the intestinal tracts of immunized individuals, and are excreted in feces to the environment resulting in a potential biosafety issue. The releasing risk can be minimized by immediate elimination of the persistent vaccine bacteria once adequate protective immune responses have been elicited by the vaccine bacteria. In a previous study, inducible expression of truncated yncE gene (yncE*) was found lethal to host bacteria. This feature has an application potential in biosafety control. Here, we assessed the efficacy of YncE* in eliminating an attenuated strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium in a mouse model. To this end, a pBAD-derived plasmid containing yncE* under the control of the Ara promoter was transformed into a ΔphoPQ mutant of S. Typhimurium. Our data show that the induced expression of yncE* in the presence of arabinose eliminated the vaccine bacteria both in vitro and in vivo. BALB/c mice with or without streptomycin-pretreatment were used to assess the efficacy of YncE* in vivo. Oral administration of 500 μl of 20% arabinose at 24 h postvaccination removed the vaccine bacteria from the guts of the tested mice without streptomycin-pretreatment. For streptomycin-pretreated mice, which were colonized with higher levels of Salmonella, an additional gavage of arabinose was required to completely eliminate the vaccine bacteria in the guts of the tested mice. The orally administered arabinose did not affect the persistence of bacteria that had penetrated the intestinal mucosa of the immunized mice. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the protection rate between the routine immunization and the immunization with the arabinose treatment. The results indicate that the yncE* element improves the biosafety of the bacterial vaccine, and can be taken in consideration in future design of live bacterial vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2643683252,"As an inhibitor of microtubule assembly, combretastatin A-4 (CA-4)-induced biological responses in tumor cells have been well known, but the corresponding changes in nano-biophysical properties were not investigated given the lack of an ideal tool. Using AFM technique, we investigated the alteration of nano-biophysical properties when CA-4-treated tumor cells underwent the different biological processes, including cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and autophagy. We found that CA-4-resistant cells were rougher with the presence of characteristic ""ridges"", indicating that the development of ""ridge"" structure may be a determinant of the sensitivity of cells to CA-4 compounds. CA-4 induced G2/M arrest and apoptosis in sensitive cells but triggered anti-apoptotic autophagy in resistant cells. CA-4 treatment caused an increase in stiffness in both sensitive and resistant cells. However, these cells exhibited different changes in cell surface roughness. CA-4 decreased Ra and Rq values in sensitive cells but increased these values in resistant cells. The reorganization of F-actin might contribute to the different changes of nano-biophysical properties in CA-4-sensitive and-resistant cells. Our results suggest that cellular nano-biophysical properties, such as ""ridges"", roughness and stiffness, could be applied as potential biomarkers for evaluating CA-4 compounds, and knowledge regarding how biological alterations cause changes in cellular nano-biophysical properties is helpful to develop a new high-resolution screening tool for anti-tumor agents."
https://openalex.org/W2692214264,"EGFR inhibitors, even with therapeutics superiorities in anticancer, can cause idiosyncratic pulmonary and hepatic toxicities that are associated with the reactive electrophile bioactivated by Cytochrome P450s (P450s). Until now, neither has the electrophilic intermediate been caught experimentally, nor has the subtle mechanism been declared. Herein, the underlying mechanism of bioactivation mediated by P450s was explored by DFT calculations for a case of EGFR inhibitor, Erlotinib. Based on the calculation and analysis, we suggest that with other metabolites, reactive electrophiles of Erlotinib: epoxide and quinine-imine, can be generated by several steps along the oxidative reaction pathway. The generation of epoxide needs two steps: (1) the addition of Erlotinib to Compound I (Cpd I) and (2) the rearrangement of protons. Whereas, quinine-imine needs a further oxidation step (3) via which quinone is generated and ultimately turns into quinine-imine. Although both reactive electrophiles can be produced for either face-on or side-on pose of Erlotinib, the analysis of energy barriers indicates that the side-on path is preferred in solvent environment. In the rate-determining step, e.g. the addition of Erlotinib to the porphyrin, the reaction barrier for side-on conformation is decreased in aqueous and protein environment compared with gas phase, whereas, the barrier for face-on pose is increased in solvent environment. The simulated mechanism is in good agreement with the speculation in previous experiment. The understanding of the subtle mechanism of bioactivation of Erlotinib will provide theoretical support for toxicological mechanism of EGFR inhibitors."
