https://openalex.org/W2922292434,"Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) promote endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and procoagulant state. We investigated the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on prothrombotic state and endothelial function in mice and in human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). Human aPL were injected to C57BL/6 mice treated or not with HCQ. Vascular endothelial function and eNOS were assessed in isolated mesenteric arteries. Thrombosis was assessed both in vitro by measuring thrombin generation time (TGT) and tissue factor (TF) expression and in vivo by the measurement of the time to occlusion in carotid and the total thrombosis area in mesenteric arteries. TGT, TF, and VCAM1 expression were evaluated in HAEC. aPL increased VCAM-1 expression and reduced endothelium dependent relaxation to acetylcholine. In parallel, aPL shortened the time to occlusion and extended thrombus area in mice. This was associated with an overexpression of TF and an increased TGT in mice and in HAEC. HCQ reduced clot formation as well as TGT, and improved endothelial-dependent relaxations. Finally, HCQ increased the p-eNOS/eNOS ratio. This study provides new evidence that HCQ improves procoagulant status and vascular function in APS by modulating eNOS, leading to an improvement in the production of NO."
https://openalex.org/W2922285504,"As in many nations, air pollution linked to rapid industrialization is a public health and environmental concern in Malaysia, especially in cities. Understanding awareness of air pollution and support for environmental protection from the general public is essential for informing governmental approaches to dealing with this problem. This study presents a cross-sectional survey conducted in the Klang Valley and Iskandar conurbations to examine urban Malaysians' perception, awareness and opinions of air pollution. The survey was conducted in two languages, English and Malay, and administered through the online survey research software, Qualtrics. The survey consisted of three sections, where we collected sociodemographic information, information on the public perception of air quality and the causes of air pollution, information on public awareness of air pollution and its related impacts, and information on attitudes towards environmental protection. Of 214 respondents, over 60% were positive towards the air quality at both study sites despite the presence of harmful levels of air pollution. The air in the Klang Valley was perceived to be slightly more polluted and causing greater health issues. Overall, the majority of respondents were aware that motor vehicles represent the primary pollution source, yet private transport was still the preferred choice of transportation mode. A generally positive approach towards environmental protection emerged from the data. However, participants showed stronger agreement with protection actions that do not involve individual effort. Nonetheless, we found that certain segments of the sample (people owning more than three vehicles per household and those with relatives who suffered from respiratory diseases) were significantly more willing to personally pay for environmental protection compared to others. Implications point to the need for actions for spreading awareness of air pollution to the overall population, especially with regards to its health risks, as well as strategies for increasing the perception of behavioural control, especially with regards to motor vehicles' usage."
https://openalex.org/W2921418834,"H. pylori infection and eradication cause perturbations of the gut microbiome. The gut microbiota has been identified as a potential contributor to metabolic diseases. We evaluate whether these alterations in intestinal microbiota composition produced by H. pylori infection and its posterior eradication with antibiotic treatment could be associated with glucose homeostasis in metabolically healthy subjects.Forty adult patients infected with H. pylori and 20 control subjects were recruited. The infected subjects were evaluated before and two months after eradication treatment (omeprazole, clarithromycin, amoxicillin). The microbiota composition in fecal samples was determined by 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4) sequencing using Illumina Miseq.Patients (pre- and post-H. pylori eradication) showed a decreased bacterial richness and diversity with respect to controls. There was an improvement in glucose homeostasis in subjects two months after H. pylori eradication treatment. Changes in the amount of Rikenellaceae, Butyricimonas, E. biforme, B. fragilis, and Megamonas were inversely associated with changes in the glucose level or related parameters (Hb1ac) in H. pylori eradication subjects.H. pylori infection and eradication with antibiotic treatment causes alteration of the human gut microbiome. The increase in SCFA-producing bacteria and glucose-removing bacteria, specifically members of Megamonas, Rikenellaceae and Butyricimonas, has been related with an improvement in glucose homeostasis after H. pylori eradication with antibiotic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2921119069,"The physiological role of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is to provide a source of cells to replace mesenchymal-derivatives in stromal tissues with high cell turnover or following stromal tissue damage to elicit repair. Human MSCs have been shown to suppress in vitro T-cell responses via a number of mechanisms including indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). This immunomodulatory capacity is likely to be related to their in vivo function in tissue repair where local, transient suppression of immune responses would benefit differentiation. Further understanding of the impact of locally modulated immune responses by MSCs is hampered by evidence that IDO is not produced or utilized by mouse MSCs. In this study, we demonstrate that IDO-mediated tryptophan starvation triggered by human MSCs inhibits T-cell activation and proliferation through induction of cellular stress. Significantly, we show that despite utilizing different means, immunomodulation of murine T-cells also involves cellular stress and thus is a common strategy of immunoregulation conserved between mouse and humans."
https://openalex.org/W2921690046,"In diet-induced obesity, metformin (MF) has weight-lowering effect and improves glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity. However, there is no information on the efficiency of MF and the mechanisms of its action in melanocortin-type obesity. We studied the effect of the 10-day treatment with MF at the doses of 200, 400 and 600 mg/kg/day on the food intake and the metabolic and hormonal parameters in female C57Bl/6J (genotype Ay/a) agouti-mice with melanocortin-type obesity, and the influence of MF on the hypothalamic signaling in obese animals at the most effective metabolic dose (600 mg/kg/day). MF treatment led to a decrease in food intake, the body and fat weights, the plasma levels of glucose, insulin and leptin, all increased in agouti-mice, to an improvement of the lipid profile and glucose sensitivity, and to a reduced fatty liver degeneration. In the hypothalamus of obese agouti-mice, the leptin and insulin content was reduced and the expression of the genes encoding leptin receptor (LepR), MC3- and MC4-melanocortin receptors and pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), the precursor of anorexigenic melanocortin peptides, was increased. The activities of AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and the transcriptional factor STAT3 were increased, while Akt-kinase activity did not change from control C57Bl/6J (a/a) mice. In the hypothalamus of MF-treated agouti-mice (10 days, 600 mg/kg/day), the leptin and insulin content was restored, Akt-kinase activity was increased, and the activities of AMPK and STAT3 were reduced and did not differ from control mice. In the hypothalamus of MF-treated agouti-mice, the Pomc gene expression was six times higher than in control, while the gene expression for orexigenic neuropeptide Y was decreased by 39%. Thus, we first showed that MF treatment leads to an improvement of metabolic parameters and a decrease of hyperleptinemia and hyperinsulinaemia in genetically-induced melanocortin obesity, and the specific changes in the hypothalamic signaling makes a significant contribution to this effect of MF."
https://openalex.org/W2920967811,"During experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model for multiple sclerosis associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) overexpress proteoglycan nerve/glial antigen 2 (NG2), proliferate, and make contacts with the microvessel wall. To explore whether OPCs may actually be recruited within the neurovascular unit (NVU), de facto intervening in its cellular and molecular composition, we quantified by immunoconfocal morphometry the presence of OPCs in contact with brain microvessels, during postnatal cerebral cortex vascularization at postnatal day 6, in wild-type (WT) and NG2 knock-out (NG2KO) mice, and in the cortex of adult naïve and EAE-affected WT and NG2KO mice. As observed in WT mice during postnatal development, a higher number of juxtavascular and perivascular OPCs was revealed in adult WT mice during EAE compared to adult naïve WT mice. In EAE-affected mice, OPCs were mostly associated with microvessels that showed altered claudin-5 and occludin tight junction (TJ) staining patterns and barrier leakage. In contrast, EAE-affected NG2KO mice, which did not show any significant increase in vessel-associated OPCs, seemed to retain better preserved TJs and BBB integrity. As expected, absence of NG2, in both OPCs and pericytes, led to a reduced content of vessel basal lamina molecules, laminin, collagen VI, and collagen IV. In addition, analysis of the major ligand/receptor systems known to promote OPC proliferation and migration indicated that vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA), and the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) were the molecules most likely involved in proliferation and recruitment of vascular OPCs during EAE. These results were confirmed by real time-PCR that showed Fgf2, Pdgfa and Tgfb expression on isolated cerebral cortex microvessels and by dual RNAscope-immunohistochemistry/in situ hybridization (IHC/ISH), which detected Vegfa and Vegfr2 transcripts on cerebral cortex sections. Overall, this study suggests that vascular OPCs, in virtue of their developmental arrangement and response to neuroinflammation and growth factors, could be integrated among the classical NVU cell components. Moreover, the synchronized activation of vascular OPCs and pericytes during both BBB development and dysfunction, points to NG2 as a key regulator of vascular interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2921893728,"Previously, we showed that mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) can be mobilized into peripheral blood using electroacupuncture (EA) at acupoints, LI-4, LI-11, GV-14, and GV-20. The purpose of this study was to determine whether EA-mobilized MSC could be harvested and expanded in vitro to be used as an autologous cell therapy in horses. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) isolated from young and aged lame horses (n = 29) showed a marked enrichment for MSCs. MSC were expanded in vitro (n = 25) and administered intravenously at a dose of 50 x 106 (n = 24). Treatment resulted in significant improvement in lameness as assessed by the American Association of Equine Practitioners (AAEP) lameness scale (n = 23). MSCs exhibited immunomodulatory function by inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation and induction of IL-10. Intradermal testing showed no immediate or delayed immune reactions to MSC (1 x 106 to 1 x 104). In this study, we demonstrated an efficient, safe and reproducible method to mobilize and expand, in vitro, MSCs in sufficiently high concentrations for therapeutic administration. We confirm the immunomodulatory function of these cells in vitro. This non-pharmacological and non-surgical strategy for stem cell harvest has a broad range of biomedical applications and represents an improved clinically translatable and economical cell source for humans."

Microbes can cause autoimmunity, trigger autoimmunity in genetically susceptible individuals or prevent autoimmunity. There were reports about intestinal flora changes in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) patients, but no data were available in northeast China. In this study, we investigated the intestinal flora changes of SLE patients in Heilongjiang province located in northeast China.Feces from 16 SLE patients and 14 healthy volunteers were employed to extract bacterial DNA, amplify 16s RNA of bacteria, and analyze the biological information by sequencing. The statistical analysis used the SPSS version of 17.We found that there were 1 phylums, 4 families and 9 genera in the intestinal flora of SLE patients. And the nine differences genera can be used to distinguish SLE patients from normal people.We found an increase of Proteobacteria and a decrease of Ruminococcaceae in SLE patients in different regions. In addition, we found that some proteins, enzymes, and diseases were significantly associated with SLE."
https://openalex.org/W2922077187,"Fermented dairy products can be rich in beneficial microbes and one such product with potential is mabisi. Mabisi is a traditional fermented milk product from Zambia made through spontaneous fermentation of raw milk at ambient temperature using a calabash (gourd), clay pot, plastic or metal container. The fermentation takes about 48 hours after which the product is stirred and ready for consumption. This study was aimed at determining the types of production methods of mabisi and identifying the critical production process parameters. A survey was conducted using interviews and observations to determine the existing production practices/technologies and to capture indigenous knowledge on mabisi production in nine provinces of Zambia. We found seven different production methods which we coined; tonga, thick-tonga, illa, barotse, backslopping, cooked and creamy types. Interestingly, the tonga-type mabisi was produced throughout the country by different ethnic groups. The main process parameters were found to be fermentation time and temperature, type of containers, presence/absence of backslopping, agitation, heating and cooling, removal of whey and addition of raw milk. And further found that mabisi is a versatile product consumed with a wide variety of foods. This basic information is crucial for production process optimisation and microbial communities dynamics studies."
https://openalex.org/W2922249907,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the consequence of implementing a Nordic Hamstring exercise (NHE) protocol during the first 15 to 17 weeks of the season to assess the effect on sprinting and NHE strength (NHEs) in professional football players. The study examined 50 healthy male professional football players (age 18.8±0.8yr; height 176.8±6.9cm; weight 71.3±5.7kg) belonging to 3 of the reserve squads of three Spanish La-Liga clubs divided in 2 intervention teams [Nordic-Group1 (NG-1) and Nordic-Group2 (NG-2, extensive experience in NHE)] and 1 team as a control-group (CG). NHEs and linear sprint (T5, T10, T20-m) were evaluated at the beginning of the season and at the end of an intervention period of conditioning and football training, supplemented with a NHE protocol (24 sessions for NG-1 and 22 sessions for NG-2) or without using the NHE at all (CG). Sprint times were substantially improved in all groups (ES from -2.24±0.75 to -0.60±0.37). NHEs was enhanced absolute and relative to body-mass only in NG-1 after the training period (ES from 0.84±0.32 to 0.74±0.26), while in the NG-2 there were only improvements in average NHEs relative to body-mass (ES = 0.39±0.36). The improvements in T20-m were substantially greater in NG-2 vs. NG-1, and there were no differences in sprint performance changes between NG-1 and CG. Changes in sprinting performance and NHEs were unrelated. NHEs was largely correlated with the body-mass of the players. Results indicate that the improvements in sprint are not dependent on the NHEs changes, with no relationships between NHEs and sprint performance, and between sprint changes and changes in NHEs."
https://openalex.org/W2922322478,"This study examines how negative shocks due to, for example, natural disasters propagate through supply chains. We apply a simulation technique to actual supply chain data covering most Japanese firms. To investigate the property of the propagation in the network, we test different types of artificial negative shocks. We find that, first, network structures severely affect the speed of propagation in the short run, and the total loss in the long run. The scale-free nature of the actual supply-chain network—that is, the power-law degree distribution—leads to faster propagation. Second, more intensive damages—that is, more damages suffered by fewer firms—result in faster propagation than extensive damages of the same total size. Third, the actual supply-chain network has innate robustness that comes from substitutability of supplies. If the supply-chain network has severe substitutability, the propagation of negative shocks becomes substantially large. Fourth, direct damages in urban regions promote faster propagation than those in rural regions. Fifth, different sectoral damages show significant differences in the speed of propagation. Finally, we check the indirect damage triggered by a single firm’s loss: 9.7% of all firms contribute to significant loss, and this loss accounts for more than 10% of the damage to the entire production. The simulations conspicuously show that different direct damages, even if they have the same total magnitude of damages, can generate considerably different damages because of the structure of the supply-chain network."
https://openalex.org/W2908816484,"Monitoring Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) effects is necessary to capture resistant patients and stop or change treatment. The aim of this study was to assess the tumor response at an early stage, after the first doses of the NAC, based on the variability of the backscattered ultrasound energy, and backscatter statistics. The backscatter statistics has not previously been used to monitor NAC effects. The B-mode ultrasound images and raw radio frequency data from breast tumors were obtained using an ultrasound scanner before chemotherapy and 1 week after each NAC cycle. Twenty-four malignant breast cancers, qualified for neoadjuvant treatment before surgery, were included in the study. The shape parameter of the homodyned K distribution and integrated backscatter, along with the tumor size in the longest dimension, were determined based on ultrasound data and used as markers for NAC response. Cancer tumors were assigned to responding and non-responding groups, according to histopathological evaluation, which was a reference in assessing the utility of markers. Statistical analysis was performed to rate the ability of markers to predict NAC response based on data obtained after subsequent therapeutic doses. Statistically significant differences between groups were obtained after 2, 3, 4, and 5 doses of NAC for quantitative ultrasound markers and after 5 doses for the assessment based on maximum tumor dimension. After the second and third NAC courses the marker, which was a linear combination of both quantitative ultrasound parameters, was characterized by an AUC of 0.82 and 0.91, respectively. The introduction of statistical parameters of ultrasonic backscatter to monitor the effects of chemotherapy can increase the effectiveness of monitoring and contribute to a better personalization of NAC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2922020058,"Habitat shifts that occur during the life cycles of marine fishes influence population connectivity and structure. A generalized additive modeling approach was used to characterize relationships between environmental variables and the relative abundance of red snapper Lutjanus campechanus over unconsolidated substrate on the continental shelf (<150 m) of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (GoM) at three different life stages: juvenile (age-0, <125 mm FL), sub-adult (age-1-2, 125–300 mm FL), and adult (age-2+, >300 mm FL). Fisheries independent data (2008–2014) were used to develop separate models for both the eastern and western GoM, and final models were used to predict the relative availability of suitable habitat for each life stage across the two regions. Predictor variables included in final models varied by age class and region, with depth, dissolved oxygen, longitude, and distance to artificial structure common to most models. Depth was among the most influential variables in all models, and preferred depth increased with increasing size/age. Regional differences in fish-habitat relationships were also observed, as relative abundance of larger red snapper over unconsolidated substrates was more closely linked to artificial structure in the eastern GoM. The location of predicted high quality habitat for juvenile red snapper was greatest on the inner Texas shelf and a smaller area east of the Mississippi River Delta, suggesting these two areas may represent important nursery grounds for the respective regions. Clear ontogenetic shifts in the spatial distribution of predicted high quality habitat were evident in both the eastern (expansion from west to east with age) and western (shift from inshore to offshore) GoM. Given the unique population dynamics between the eastern and western GoM, improving our understanding of spatial and temporal variability in habitat quality may be important to maintaining connectivity between juvenile and adult habitats, and may enhance recovery and management of red snapper stocks in the GoM."
https://openalex.org/W2922410370,"Francisella tularensis is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular pathogen and the causative agent of a lethal human disease known as tularemia. Due to its extremely high virulence and potential to be used as a bioterror agent, F. tularensis is classified by the CDC as a Category A Select Agent. As an intracellular pathogen, F. tularensis during its intracellular residence encounters a number of oxidative and nitrosative stresses. The roles of the primary antioxidant enzymes SodB, SodC and KatG in oxidative stress resistance and virulence of F. tularensis live vaccine strain (LVS) have been characterized in previous studies. However, very fragmentary information is available regarding the role of peroxiredoxin of the AhpC/TSA family (annotated as AhpC) of F. tularensis SchuS4; whereas the role of AhpC of F. tularensis LVS in tularemia pathogenesis is not known. This study was undertaken to exhaustively investigate the role of AhpC in oxidative stress resistance of F. tularensis LVS and SchuS4. We report that AhpC of F. tularensis LVS confers resistance against a wide range of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, and serves as a virulence factor. In highly virulent F. tularensis SchuS4 strain, AhpC serves as a key antioxidant enzyme and contributes to its robust oxidative and nitrosative stress resistance, and intramacrophage survival. We also demonstrate that there is functional redundancy among primary antioxidant enzymes AhpC, SodC, and KatG of F. tularensis SchuS4. Collectively, this study highlights the differences in antioxidant defense mechanisms of F. tularensis LVS and SchuS4."
https://openalex.org/W2921719515,"Porphyromonas gulae, an animal periodontal pathogen, possess fimbriae classified into three genotypes (A-C) based on the diversity of fimA genes encoding FimA. Accumulating evidence suggests that P. gulae strains with type C fimbriae are more virulent as compared to those with other types. The ability of these organisms to adhere to and invade gingival epithelial cells has yet to be examined. P. gulae showed the greatest levels of adhesion and invasion at a multiplicity of infection of 100 for 90 min. P. gulae type C and some type B strains invaded gingival epithelial cells at significantly greater levels than the other strains, at the same level of efficiency as P. gingivalis with type II fimbriae. Adhesion and invasion of gingival epithelial cells by P. gulae were inhibited by cytochalasin D and sodium azide, indicating the requirements of actin polymerization and energy metabolism for those activities. Invasion within gingival epithelial cells was blocked by staurosporine, whereas those inhibitors showed little effects on adhesion, while nocodazole and cycloheximide had negligible effects on either adhesion or invasion. P. gulae proteases were found to be essential for adhesion and invasion of gingival epithelial cells, while its DNA and RNA, and protein synthesis were unnecessary for those activities. Additionally, α5β1 integrin antibodies significantly inhibited adhesion and invasion by P. gulae. This is the first report to characterize P. gulae adhesion and invasion of human gingival epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2949369125,"In plants, myo-inositol-1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakisphosphate (InsP6), also known as phytic acid (PA), is a major component of organic phosphorus (P), and accounts for up to 85% of the total P in seeds. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), PA mainly accumulates in rice bran, and chelates mineral cations, resulting in mineral deficiencies among brown rice consumers. Therefore, considerable efforts have been focused on the development of low PA (LPA) rice cultivars. In this study, we performed genetic and molecular analyses of OsLpa1, a major PA biosynthesis gene, in Sanggol, a low PA mutant variety developed via chemical mutagenesis of Ilpum rice cultivar. Genetic segregation and sequencing analyses revealed that a recessive allele, lpa1-3, at the OsLpa1 locus (Os02g0819400) was responsible for a significant reduction in seed PA content in Sanggol. The lpa1-3 gene harboured a point mutation (C623T) in the fourth exon of the predicted coding region, resulting in threonine (Thr) to isoleucine (Ile) amino acidsubstitution at position 208 (Thr208Ile). Three-dimensional analysis of Lpa1 protein structure indicated that myo-inositol 3-monophosphate [Ins(3)P1] could bind to the active site of Lpa1, with ATP as a cofactor for catalysis. Furthermore, the presence of Thr208 in the loop adjacent to the entry site of the binding pocket suggests that Thr208Ile substitution is involved in regulating enzyme activity via phosphorylation. Therefore, we propose that Thr208Ile substitution in lpa1-3 reduces Lpa1 enzyme activity in Sanggol, resulting in reduced PA biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2921185472,"Early lactation is an energy-demanding period for dairy cows which may lead to negative energy balance, threatening animal health and consequently productivity. Herein we studied hepatic mitochondrial function in Holstein-Friesian multiparous dairy cows during lactation, under two different feeding strategies. During the first 180 days postpartum the cows were fed a total mixed ration (70% forage: 30% concentrate) ad libitum (non-grazing group, G0) or grazed Festuca arundinacea or Mendicago sativa plus supplementation (grazing group, G1). From 180 to 250 days postpartum, all cows grazed Festuca arundinacea and were supplemented with total mixed ration. Mitochondrial function was assessed measuring oxygen consumption rate in liver biopsies and revealed that maximum respiratory rate decreased significantly in grazing cows during early lactation, yet was unchanged in non-grazing cows during the lactation curve. While no differences could be found in mitochondrial content or oxidative stress markers, a significant increase in protein lysine acetylation was found in grazing cows during early lactation but not in cows from the non-grazing group. Mitochondrial acetylation positively correlated with liver triglycerides and β-hydroxybutyrate plasma levels, well-known markers of negative energy balance, while a negative correlation was found with the maximum respiratory rate and sirtuin 3 levels. To our knowledge this is the first report of mitochondrial function in liver biopsies of dairy cows during lactation. On the whole our results indicate that mitochondrial function is impaired during early lactation in grazing cows and that acetylation may account for changes in mitochondrial function in this period. Additionally, our results suggest that feeding total mixed ration during early lactation may be an efficient protective strategy."

Background Despite the prevalence of congenital heart disease (CHD) in childhood, little is known about the experiences and impacts on the children and their caregivers after CHD diagnosis and surgery. Such knowledge is needed for meaningful support. Design A qualitative descriptive study. Methods Twenty-two caregivers of CHD children undergoing cardiac surgery participated in semi-structured interviews at a University Children’s Hospital in China. Data were collected by an experienced and trained interviewer. Qualitative content analysis was chosen to describe the experiences of the caregivers. Results Caregivers of CHD children experienced significant demands. After the children underwent their CHD operations, the caregivers experienced complex psychological feelings and excessive stress impacting upon theirlives. In addition, caregivers constantly adapted their roles with self-fulfillment in caring activities. Conclusions CHD surgery has a major impact on the emotions and daily lives of children and their caregivers. This study offers a framework for understanding the importance of actively listening to caregivers so coping strategies can be implemented. Relevance to clinical practice Theexperiencesdescribed in this study contribute to a better understanding of the needs of caregivers whose children underwent CHD operations.

https://openalex.org/W2920965285,"High-risk neuroblastoma (NB) is lethal childhood cancer. Published data including ours have reported the anti-proliferative effect of Xanthohumol (XN), a prenylated chalcone, in various cancer types suggesting that XN could be a useful small molecule compound against cancer. The TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL) is an endogenous ligand that is expressed in various immune cells. TRAIL mediates apoptosis through binding of transmembrane receptors, death receptor 4 (DR4) and/or death receptor 5 (DR5). Cancer cells are frequently resistant to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, and the cause of this may be decreased expression of death receptors. This study aimed to identify combination therapies that exploit XN for NB. First, the effect of XN on cellular proliferation in human NB cell lines NGP, SH-SY-5Y, and SK-N-AS were determined via MTT assay, colony forming assay, and real-time live cell imaging confluency. XN treatment causes a statistically significant decrease in the viability of NB cells with IC50 values of approximately 12 μM for all three cell lines. Inhibition of cell proliferation via apoptosis was evidenced by an increase in pro-apoptotic markers (cleaved PARP, cleaved caspase-3/-7, and Bax) and a decrease in an anti-apoptotic marker, Bcl-2. Importantly, XN treatment inhibited PI3K/Akt pathway and associated with increased expression of DR5 by both mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, a statistically significant synergistic reduction was observed following combination treatment (50%) compared to either TRAIL (5%) or XN (15%) alone in SK-N-AS cells. Therefore, this study shows XN treatment reduces NB cell growth via apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, and enhanced growth reduction was observed in combination with TRAIL. This is the first study to demonstrate that XN alters the expression of DR5 as well as the synergistic effect of XN on TRAIL in NB and provides a strong rationale for further preclinical analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2921533828,"Considering the serious land-based pollution and the weak water exchange ability of western Laizhou Bay, it is essential to conduct an ecological risk assessment of the pollutants in this area. In this study, the ecological risk caused by heavy metals deposited in the surface sediments and those resuspended in the seawater of western Laizhou Bay was evaluated using probabilistic approaches. First, the concentrations of seven heavy metals, namely As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, and Zn, in the surface sediments and seawater of western Laizhou Bay were detected during the spring and autumn of 2016. The concentrations of As, Cd, Cr, Cu, and Pb were found to be at levels comparable to those in the other global coastal systems, while those of Hg and Zn were lower than those in other coastal areas. Next, an ecological risk assessment of heavy metals in the surface sediments was performed using a typical potential ecological risk index and refined by using a Monte Carlo simulation. The results suggested low risk for the heavy metals detected in the sediments of western Laizhou Bay, with the exception of Hg in September 2016, which showed a probability (0.03%) of moderate risk. Meanwhile, the aquatic ecological risk assessment of the heavy metals was performed by applying a combination of hazard quotient (HQ) and joint probability curve. While the ecological risk of Cd, Hg, and Pb was found to be acceptable, the HQs for Cr, Cu, and Zn were greater than 1, and the overall risk probability of their adverse effects was higher than 0.05, suggesting certain ecological risk. Specifically, in the case of As, the overall risk probability was lower than 0.05, suggesting that its ecological risk was acceptable, although its HQ was greater than 1. Thus, by applying the probabilistic approaches, the ecological risk of the heavy metals in western Laizhou Bay was better characterized in this study, avoiding both overestimation and underestimation of ecological risk."

We assessed the reliability characteristics of the sublingual microcirculation parameters Vascular Density (VD), Red Blood Cell Filling (RBCF), and Perfused Boundary Region (PBR) as obtained by sidestream darkfield imaging.For each of the three parameters, the variance components of measurement, the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC), the Standard Error of Measurement, and the limits of agreement were estimated for the intra-rater setting (N = 50) and the inter-rater setting (N = 48). Subsequently, as a proof of concept, the reliability measures were used for a power analysis to design studies to evaluate the effect of acute stimuli-i.e. having a meal (N = 50) and cigarette smoking (N = 21) on the three parameters.Reproducibility was poor for all three parameters. The intra-rater ICC for 2 measurements was 0.28 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.53) for the VD, 0.51 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.69) for the RBCF, and 0.33 (95% CI: 0.08-0.56) for the PBR. The standard errors of measurement and the limits of agreement for all three parameters were larger than most statistically significant intra-individual or inter-individual differences reported in previous studies. The proofs of concept showed that sample sizes in excess of 600 subjects are necessary to reach statistical significance for the observed effects of having a meal or smoking on VD and PBR.The reliability of the three sublingual microcirculation parameters in their current form appears to be low and a large sample size is advisable for their use in conditions similar to those we describe."
https://openalex.org/W2921929874,"Apples contain bioactive compounds with the potential to alleviate clinical signs associated with obesity, a phenomenon likely related to the composition and function of the gut microbiota. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of apple supplementation on the fecal microbiota and gut metabolites of Dawley Sprague rats fed a high-fat (HF group) or a low-fat (LF group) diet. The fecal microbiota was examined using 16S marker sequencing targeting the V4 region in a MiSeq instrument (Illumina). With the exception of Blautia, which was higher in supplemented rats compared to controls within the LF group, significant differences in fecal microbiota between supplemented rats and controls were only found in the HF group. This suggests that the effect of apple supplementation on the gut microbiota is strongly dependent on the composition of the diet, a phenomenon with potential consequences for obese human patients. Principal Coordinate Analysis of unweighted UniFrac distances revealed a clear strong separation of bacterial communities based on diet (HF and LF, P = 0.001, R = 0.69, ANOSIM test) and based on apple supplementation within the HF group, albeit less strongly (P = 0.006, R = 0.27, ANOSIM test). No differences were found for fecal SCFAs but proteomics and metabolomics analyses showed differential expression of both proteins and metabolites between supplemented rats and controls in the HF group. The results of this study can guide future explorations of the effect of apple supplementation on human health."
https://openalex.org/W2922074949,"Healthcare providers have key roles in the prevention of, detection of, and interventions for human trafficking. Yet caring for trafficked persons is particularly challenging: patients whose identities are unknown, unreliable, or false could receive subpar care from providers delivering care in a vacuum of relevant information. The application of precision medicine principles and integration of biometric data (including genetic information) could facilitate patient identification, enable longitudinal medical records, and improve continuity and quality of care for this vulnerable patient population. Scant empirical data exist regarding healthcare system preparedness and care for the needs of this vulnerable population nor data on perspectives on the use and risks of biometrics or genetic information for trafficked patients.To address this gap, we conducted mixed-methods research involving semi-structured interviews with key informants, which informed a subsequent broad survey of physicians and registered nurses.Our findings support the perception that trafficked persons obtain care yet remain unnoticed or undocumented in the electronic health record. Our survey findings further reveal that healthcare providers remain largely unaware of human trafficking issues and are inadequately prepared to provide patient-centered care for trafficked and unidentified patients.Meaningful efforts to design and implement precision medicine initiatives in an inclusive way that optimizes impacts are unlikely to succeed without concurrent efforts to increase general awareness of and preparedness to care for trafficked persons. Additional research is needed to examine properly the potential utility for biometrics to improve the delivery of care for trafficked patients."
https://openalex.org/W2922413207,"Automatic algorithms for stent struts segmentation in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of coronary arteries have been developed over the years, particularly with application on metallic stents. The aim of this study is three-fold: (1) to develop and to validate a segmentation algorithm for the detection of both lumen contours and polymeric bioresorbable scaffold struts from 8-bit OCT images, (2) to develop a method for automatic OCT pullback quality assessment, and (3) to demonstrate the applicability of the segmentation algorithm for the creation of patient-specific stented coronary artery for local hemodynamics analysis.The proposed OCT segmentation algorithm comprises four steps: (1) image pre-processing, (2) lumen segmentation, (3) stent struts segmentation, (4) strut-based lumen correction. This segmentation process is then followed by an automatic OCT pullback image quality assessment. This method classifies the OCT pullback image quality as 'good' or 'poor' based on the number of regions detected by the stent segmentation. The segmentation algorithm was validated against manual segmentation of 1150 images obtained from 23 in vivo OCT pullbacks.When considering the entire set of OCT pullbacks, lumen segmentation showed results comparable with manual segmentation and with previous studies (sensitivity ~97%, specificity ~99%), while stent segmentation showed poorer results compared to manual segmentation (sensitivity ~63%, precision ~83%). The OCT pullback quality assessment algorithm classified 7 pullbacks as 'poor' quality cases. When considering only the 'good' classified cases, the performance indexes of the scaffold segmentation were higher (sensitivity >76%, precision >86%).This study proposes a segmentation algorithm for the detection of lumen contours and stent struts in low quality OCT images of patients treated with polymeric bioresorbable scaffolds. The segmentation results were successfully used for the reconstruction of one coronary artery model that included a bioresorbable scaffold geometry for computational fluid dynamics analysis."
https://openalex.org/W2920905063,"Number magnitude estimation has been investigated over the last decades using different tasks including non-symbolic numerosity but also number line estimation tasks. Recently, a bi-directional mapping process was suggested for numerosity estimation accounting for underestimation in a perception version of the task (i.e., indicating the number of non-symbolic dots in a set) and overestimation in the corresponding production task (i.e., produce the number of dots indicated by a symbolic number). In the present study, we evaluated the generalizability of these estimation biases in perception and production tasks to bounded and unbounded number line estimation. Importantly, target numbers were underestimated/overestimated by participants in the perception/production version of numerosity estimation as well as unbounded number line estimation. However, this pattern was reversed for bounded number line estimation. Thereby, the present data indicate a conceptual similarity of unbounded number line estimation and the established non-symbolic numerosity estimation task as a measure of numerical estimation. Accordingly, this corroborates the notion that unbounded number line estimation may reflect a purer measure of number magnitude representation than the bounded task version. Furthermore, our findings strengthen the bi-directional mapping hypothesis for numerical estimation by providing evidence for its generalizability to unbounded number line estimation for the first time."
https://openalex.org/W2921366073,"The main aim of the present study was to explore the value of several measures of handwriting in the study of motor abnormalities in patients with bipolar or psychotic disorders. 54 adult participants with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder and 44 matched healthy controls, participated in the study. Participants were asked to copy a handwriting pattern consisting of four loops, with an inking pen on a digitizing tablet. We collected a number of classical, non-linear and geometrical measures of handwriting. The handwriting of patients was characterized by a significant decrease in velocity and acceleration and an increase in the length, disfluency and pressure with respect to controls. Concerning non-linear measures, we found significant differences between patients and controls in the Sample Entropy of velocity and pressure, Lempel-Ziv of velocity and pressure, and Higuchi Fractal Dimension of pressure. Finally, Lacunarity, a measure of geometrical heterogeneity, was significantly greater in handwriting patterns from patients than from controls. We did not find differences in any handwriting measure on function of the specific diagnosis or the antipsychotic dose. Results indicate that participants with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder exhibit significant motor impairments and that these impairments can be readily quantified using measures of handwriting movements. Besides, they suggest that motor abnormalities are a core feature of several mental disorders and they seem to be unrelated to the pharmacological treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2921389142,"Aim We hypothesized that compromised cardiac output in asphyxiated infants may influence on the rate of disappearance of lactate due to insufficient perfusion. Methods The study was a prospective, observational study, where infants with perinatal asphyxia who met the criteria for therapeutic hypothermia were included. Cardiac output, stroke volume and heart rate were measured by electrical velocimetry in 15 newborn infants with perinatal asphyxia during the first six hours of active therapeutic hypothermia. Results from routine blood samples were collected retrospectively. Cardiac parameters were also measured in 10 healthy, term infants after caesarian section. Cardiac parameters were compared between the asphyxiated group and the control group prior to and during hypothermia. Rate of disappearance of lactate was correlated to cardiac output in the asphyxiated infants. Results Cardiac output was stable in the healthy infants from 0.5 to 6 hours postnatally. The infants with perinatal asphyxia had lower cardiac output prior to and during therapeutic hypothermia compared to the control group. Rate of disappearance of lactate was not related to cardiac output. Conclusion An association between disappearance of lactate acidosis and low cardiac output was not confirmed. A low rate of disappearance of lactate may rather be an indicator of organ injury due to asphyxia."
https://openalex.org/W2920945176,"Safety-net health systems, which serve a disproportionate share of patients at high risk for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, may use revenue generated by the federal drug discount pricing program, known as 340B, to support multidisciplinary care. Budgetary impacts of repealing the drug-pricing program are unknown. Our objective was to conduct a budgetary impact analysis of a multidisciplinary primary care-based HCV treatment program, with and without 340B support.We conducted a budgetary impact analysis from the perspective of a large safety-net medical center in Boston, Massachusetts. Participants included 302 HCV-infected patients (mean age 45, 75% male, 53% white, 77% Medicaid) referred to the primary care-based HCV treatment program from 2015-2016. Main measures included costs and revenues associated with the treatment program. Our main outcomes were net cost with and without 340B Drug Pricing support.Total program costs were $942,770, while revenues totaled $1.2 million. With the 340B Drug Pricing Program the hospital received a net revenue of $930 per patient referred to the HCV treatment program. In the absence of the 340B program, the hospital would lose $370 per patient referred. Ninety-seven percent (68/70) of patients who initiated treatment in the program achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR) at a net cost of $4,150 each, among this patient subset.The 340B Drug Pricing Program enabled a safety-net hospital to deliver effective primary care-based HCV treatment using a multidisciplinary care team. Efforts to sustain the 340B program could enable dissemination of similar HCV treatment models elsewhere."
https://openalex.org/W2921677077,"The purpose of this study was to investigate muscle activity variability within and between the right and left side of lumbar muscles in patients with chronic low back pain (cLBP) compared to healthy controls (HCs) during sustained quiet sitting. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were collected bilaterally from the lumbar muscles with 2 high density surface EMG grids of 9x14 electrodes. Root mean square values (RMS) over 1-sec epochs of all bipolar EMG leadings were obtained. Between-sides alternating activation was computed, as well as temporal- and spatial variability within the electrode grids through the coefficient of variation and correlations between RMS distributions. The subjective influence of sitting was evaluated by the rating of perceived exertion and the amount of LBP on a numeric pain rating scale. Compared to HCs, the patients with cLBP had lower temporal (p = 0.03) and similar spatial muscle activity variability during sitting, despite a more variable sitting position. This did not result in increased muscle fatigue indicated by EMG, but the patients with cLBP reported higher levels of RPE during- and more LBP after the sitting and as a consequence ended the sitting earlier than HCs (p < 0.01). Present findings lend support to the presence of less tolerance for low-level static muscle load in patients with cLBP."
https://openalex.org/W2922476419,"Has the maximum human lifespan been reached? The current record stands at 122 years, 164 days and has held for over 20 years and is more than four and three quarter years higher than the previous record. The value and persistence of this record have surprised some researchers, with some even questioning its veracity. There have been previous attempts in the literature to answer questions about how long this record might stand and whether it is truly exceptional but the focus has been mainly on the record ages, using ad hoc tools. This article contributes in two new ways. First we study lifespan records via the (inter-) record times and second we make use of specific tools from statistical Records Theory. We find that the occurrence of the present record was not surprising. We estimate around a 25% chance that the record would have survived until now and around a one in five chance that it will survive until 2050, demonstrating remarkable persistence."
https://openalex.org/W2920965087,"Some individuals seek to enhance their cognitive capabilities through the use of pharmacology. Such behavior entails potential health risks and raises ethical concerns. The aim of this study was to examine whether a precursor of behavior, ethical judgement towards the use of existing biological cognitive enhancers (e.g., coffee, legal and illegal drugs), is shaped by the perceived characteristics of these cognitive enhancers. Students and employees completed an online questionnaire which measured perceived characteristics of 15 substances presented as potential cognitive enhancers and a measure of ethical judgement towards these cognitive enhancers. Results of mixed model regression analyzes show that ethical judgement is more favourable when cognitive enhancers are perceived as being legal, familiar, efficient, and safe for users' health, supporting all hypotheses. Results further show that 36% of variance (in the null model) lies at the level of cognitive enhancers and 21% at the level of participants. In conclusion, cognitive enhancers vary widely in terms of ethical judgement, which is explained by the perception of the mentioned characteristics. Implications regarding prevention and policy-making are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2921271217,"Purpose The Ponseti Method has dramatically altered the management of clubfoot, with particular implications for limited-resource settings. We sought to describe outcomes of care and risk factors for sub-optimal results using the Ponseti Method in Haiti. Methods We conducted a records review of patients presenting from 2011–2015 to a CURE Clubfoot clinic in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. We report patient characteristics (demographics and clinical), treatment patterns (cast number/duration and tenotomy rates), and outcomes (relapse and complications). We compared treatment with benchmarks in high-income nations and used generalized linear models to identify risk factors for delayed presentation, increased number of casts, and relapse. Results Amongst 168 children, age at presentation ranged from 0 days (birth) to 4.4 years, 62% were male, 35% were born at home, 63% had bilateral disease, and 46% had idiopathic clubfeet. Prior treatment (RR 6.33, 95% CI 3.18–12.62) was associated with a higher risk of delayed presentation. Risk factors for requiring ≥ 10 casts included having a non-idiopathic diagnosis (RR 2.28, 95% CI 1.08–4.83) and higher Pirani score (RR 2.78 per 0.5 increase, 95% CI 1.17–6.64). Female sex (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.01–2.34) and higher Pirani score (RR 1.09 per 0.5 increase, 95% CI 1.00–1.17) were risk factors for relapse. Compared to North American benchmarks, children presented later (median 4.1 wks [IQR 1.6–18.1] vs. 1 wk), with longer casting (12.5 wks [SD 9.8] vs. 7.1 wks), and higher relapse (43% vs. 22%). Conclusions Higher Pirani score, prior treatment, non-idiopathic diagnosis, and female sex were associated with a higher risk of sub-optimal outcomes in this low-resource setting. Compared to high-income nations, serial casting began later, with longer duration and higher relapse. Identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes in a low-resource setting can guide counseling, program development, and resource allocation."
https://openalex.org/W2922455591,"Epiphyton, Renalcis, and Girvanella are ubiquitous genera of calcified cyanobacteria/algae from Early Paleozoic shallow-marine limestones. One genus, Epiphyton, is characterized by a particular dendritic outline, and extensive research has revealed the morphology of calcified remains although little information on cellular structure is known. The mass occurrence of calcified Epiphyton in microbialites from Cambrian Miaolingian, the Mianchi area of North China is preserved as black clots within thrombolites and have dendritic and spherical outlines when viewed with a petrographic microscope. These remains, visible under scanning electron microscope (SEM), also comprise spherical or rectangle capsules. These capsules are made up from external envelopes and internal calcite with numerous pits, which closely resemble modern benthic coccoid cyanobacteria. These pits are between 2 μm and 4 μm in diameter and are interpreted here to represent the remnants of degraded coccoid cells, while the calcite that surrounds these pits is interpreted as calcified thin extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). In contrast, associated capsular envelopes represent thick EPS mineralized by calcium carbonate with an admixture of Al-Mg-Fe silicates. Dendritic 'thalli' are typically stacked apically because of the repeated growth and calcification of these capsules. Carbon and oxygen isotope results are interpreted to indicate that both photosynthesis and heterotrophic bacterial metabolism (especially sulfate reducing bacteria) contributed to carbonate precipitation by elevated alkalinity. Epiphyton are therefore here interpreted as colonies of calcified coccoid cyanobacteria, and the carbonate-oversaturated seawater during the Cambrian was conducive to their mineralization."
https://openalex.org/W2922267751,"Recent experiments have reported an effect of weak radiofrequency magnetic fields in the MHz-range on the concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in living cells. Since the energy that could possibly be deposited by the radiation is orders of magnitude smaller than the energy of molecular thermal motion, it was suggested that the effect was caused by the interaction of RF magnetic fields with transient radical pairs within the cells, affecting the ROS formation rates through the radical pair mechanism. It is, however, at present not entirely clear how to predict RF magnetic field effects at certain field frequency and intensity in nanoscale biomolecular systems. We suggest a possible recipe for interpreting the radiofrequency effects in cells by presenting a general workflow for calculation of the reactive perturbations inside a cell as a function of RF magnetic field strength and frequency. To justify the workflow, we discuss the effects of radiofrequency magnetic fields on generic spin systems to particularly illustrate how the reactive radicals could be affected by specific parameters of the experiment. We finally argue that the suggested workflow can be used to predict effects of radiofrequency magnetic fields on radical pairs in biological cells, which is specially important for wireless recharging technologies where one has to know of any harmful effects that exposure to such radiation might cause."
https://openalex.org/W2921477495,"The μ opioid receptor (μOR), which is part of the G protein-coupled receptors family, is a membrane protein that is modulated by its lipid environment. In the present work, we model μOR in three different membrane systems: POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine), POPE (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine), and DPPC (1, 2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine) through 45 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations at the coarse-grained level. Our theoretical studies provide new insights to the lipid-induced modulation of the receptor. Particularly, to characterize how μOR interacts with each lipid, we analyze the tilt of the protein, the number of contacts occurring between the lipids and each amino acid of the receptor, and the μOR-lipid interface described as a network graph. We also analyze the variations in the number and the nature of the protein contacts that are induced by the lipid structure. We show that POPC interacts preferentially with helix 1 (H1) and helices H5-H6, POPE, with H5-H6 and H6-H7, and DPPC, with H4 and H6. We demonstrate how each of the three lipids shape the structure of the μOR."
https://openalex.org/W2920969417,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is an important target for treating systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, our study revealed three levels of TGF-β1 expression in SSc patients, indicating that inhibiting TGF-β is not sufficient to treat SSc. A previous clinical trial also displayed disappointing results. Thus, our study attempted to search for a potential novel approach. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) indicated that the SSc pathological pathways were closely associated with store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE)-regulated signals, and SOCE activity was found to be increased in SSc fibroblasts. Further treatment of SSc fibroblasts with SOCE inhibitors, 2APB, and associated calcium channel inhibitors SKF96365, and indomethacin, showed that the SOCE inhibitors selectively decreased fibrosis markers and altered the cell morphology. Consequently, SOCE inhibitors, especially 2APB and indomethacin, caused the dedifferentiation of SSc fibroblasts via cytoskeleton remodeling and altered collagen secretion and restored the cell mobility. We further explained SSc pathogenesis as fibroblast differentiation with SOCE. Treatment with exogenous factors, gelatin-1, FAM20A and human albumin, which were identified from the conditioned medium of SSc fibroblasts, was important for regulating the differentiation of fibroblasts with higher levels of SOCE and α-SMA. Conclusively, to treat SSc, blockage of the increased SOCE activity in SSc induces the dedifferentiation of SSc fibroblasts and simultaneously changes the extracellular matrix (ECM) structure to limit SSc pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2920988244,"Insomnia symptoms are common among young adults and affect about 5% to 26% of 19 to 34-year-olds. In addition, insomnia is associated with poor mental health and may affect daily performance. In research, as well as in clinical practice, sleep questionnaires are used to screen for and diagnose insomnia. However, most questionnaires are not developed according to current DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. An exception is the recently developed Sleep Condition Indicator (SCI), an eight-item scale screening for insomnia.The aim of this study was to perform a Classical Test Theory (CTT) based psychometric evaluation of the SCI in a sample of Swedish university students, by taking the ordinal nature of item level data into account.The SCI was translated into Swedish and distributed online to undergraduate students at three Swedish universities, within programs of health, psychology, science or economy. Of 3673 invited students, 634 (mean age 26.9 years; SD = 7.4) completed the questionnaire that, in addition to the SCI, comprised other scales on sleep, stress, lifestyle and students' study environment. Data were analyzed according to CTT investigating data completeness, item homogeneity and unidimensionality.Polychoric based explorative factor analysis suggested unidimensionality of the SCI, and internal consistency was good (Cronbach's alpha, 0.91; ordinal alpha, 0.94). SCI scores correlated with the Insomnia Severity Index (-0.88) as well as with sleep quality (-0.85) and perceived stress (-0.50), supporting external construct validity.These observations support the integrity of the of the SCI. The SCI demonstrates sound CTT-based psychometric properties, supporting its use as an insomnia screening tool."
https://openalex.org/W2921536215,"BACKGROUND Early initiation of antiretroviral therapy (eiART) can improve clinical outcomes for persons with HIV and reduce onward transmission risk. Baseline drug resistance testing (bDRT) can inform regimen selection upon subsequent treatment initiation. We examined the uptake of eiART and bDRT within 3 months and 30 days of HIV diagnosis. METHODS We analyzed a population-based sample from the San Francisco Department of Public Health HIV/AIDS Case Registry of newly-diagnosed HIV/non-AIDS individuals between 2001 and 2015 who received care at publicly-funded facilities (N = 3,124). RESULTS Uptake of eiART within 3 months of diagnosis increased significantly from 2001 to 2015 (p<0.001), peaking at 74% in 2015. bDRT uptake also increased significantly (p<0.001), peaking at 55% in 2012. eiART uptake was observed to be significantly associated with gender, age, race/ethnicity and transmission risk. There were no significant differences observed in demographic and risk characteristics of persons receiving bDRT in the more recent years. Of 990 persons diagnosed between 2010 and 2015, eiART uptake within 30 days of diagnosis increased from 13% to 38% (p<0.001); bDRT uptake increased from 35% to 39% but the change was not significant (p = 0.141). CONCLUSIONS Observed increases in eiART and bDRT uptake from 2010 to 2015 may reflect the adoption of treatment as prevention and a local public health policy statement in 2010 recommending treatment initiation at time of diagnosis irrespective of CD4 count. Concerns about stigma may underlie disparities in eiART, however such concerns would not bear as directly on a provider-initiated laboratory test like bDRT."
https://openalex.org/W2921970467,"Studies on cross-modal interaction have demonstrated attenuated as well as facilitated effects for both neural responses as well as behavioral performance. The goals of this pilot study were to investigate possible cross-modal interactions of tactile stimulation on visual working memory and to identify possible neuronal correlates by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). During fMRI, participants (n = 12 females, n = 12 males) performed a verbal n-back task (0-back and 2-back tasks) while tactile pressure to the left thumbnail was delivered. Participants presented significantly lower behavioral performances (increased error rates, and reaction times) during the 2-back task as compared to the 0-back task. Task performance was independent of pressure in both tasks. This means that working memory performance was not impacted by a low salient tactile stimulus. Also in the fMRI data, no significant interactions of n-back x pressure were observed. In conclusion, the current study found no influence of tactile pressure on task-related brain activity during n-back (0-back and 2-back) tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2922242099,"Air pollution is well-known as a major risk to public health, causing various diseases including pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases. As social concern increases, the amount of air pollution data is increasing rapidly. The purpose of this study is to statistically characterize dependence between major cities in China based on a measure of directional dependence estimated from PM2.5 measurements. As a measure of the directional dependence, we propose the so-called copula directional dependence (CDD) using beta regression models. An advantage of the CDD is that it does not rely on strict assumptions of specific probability distributions or linearity. We used hourly PM2.5 measurement data collected at four major cities in China: Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, and Shanghai, from 2013 to 2017. After accounting for autocorrelation in the PM2.5 time series via nonlinear autoregressive models, CDDs between the four cities were estimated to produce directed network structures of statistical dependence. In addition, a statistical method was proposed to test the directionality of dependence between each pair of cities. From the PM2.5 data, we could discover that Chengdu and Guangzhou are the most closely related cities and that the directionality between them has changed once during 2013 to 2017, which implies a major economic or environmental change in these Chinese regions."
https://openalex.org/W2951671058,"Best practices in laboratory culture management often include cryopreservation of microbiota, but this can be challenging with some virus particles. By preserving viral isolates researchers can mitigate genetic drift and laboratory-induced selection, thereby maintaining genetically consistent strains between experiments. To this end, we developed a method to cryopreserve the model, green-alga infecting virus, Paramecium bursaria Chlorella virus 1 (PBCV-1). We explored cryotolerance of the infectivity of this virus particle, whereby freezing without cryoprotectants was found to maintain the highest infectivity (~2.5%). We then assessed the cryopreservation potential of PBCV-1 during an active infection cycle in its Chlorella variabilis NC64A host, and found that virus survivorship was highest (69.5 ± 16.5%) when the infected host is cryopreserved during mid-late stages of infection (i.e., coinciding with virion assembly). The most optimal condition for cryopreservation was observed at 240 minutes post-infection. Overall, utilizing the cell as a vehicle for viral cryopreservation resulted in 24.9-30.1 fold increases in PBCV-1 survival based on 95% confidence intervals of frozen virus particles and virus cryopreserved at 240 minutes post-infection. Given that cryoprotectants are often naturally produced by psychrophilic organisms, we suspect that cryopreservation of infected hosts may be a reliable mechanism for virus persistence in non-growth permitting circumstances in the environment, such as ancient permafrosts."
https://openalex.org/W2921443350,"Objective To develop and internally validate the PROgnosis of functional recovery after Trauma (PRO-Trauma) prediction model. Design A prospective single-center longitudinal cohort study. Patients were assessed at 6 weeks and 12 months post-injury. Methods Patients that presented at the emergency department with an acute traumatic injury, were prompted for participation. Patients that completed the assessments at 6 weeks and 12 months post injury were included. Exclusion criteria: age < 18, age > 65, pathologic fractures, injuries that resulted in severe neurologic deficits. The predicted outcome, functional recovery, was defined as a Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment (SMFA-NL) Problems with Daily Activities (PDA) subscale ≤ 12.2 points at 12 months post-injury (Dutch population norm). Predictors were: gender, age, living with partner, number of chronic health conditions, SMFA-NL PDA score 6 weeks post-injury, ICU admission, length of stay in hospital, injury severity score, occurrence of complications and treatment type. All predictors were obtained before 6 weeks post-injury. Missing data were multiply imputed. Predictor variables were selected using backward stepwise multivariable logistic regression. Hosmer-Lemeshow tests were used to evaluate calibration. Bootstrap resampling was used to internally validate the final model. Results A total of 246 patients were included, of which 104 (44%) showed functional recovery. The predictors in the final PRO-Trauma model were: living with partner, the number of chronic health conditions, SMFA-NL PDA subscale score at 6 weeks post-injury and length of stay in hospital. The apparent R2 was 0.33 [0.33;0.34], the c-statistic was 0.79 [0.79;0.80]. Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated good calibration (p = 0.92). Optimism-corrected R2 was 0.28 [0.27;0.29] and the optimism-corrected Area Under the Curve was 0.77 [0.77;0.77]. Conclusion The PRO-Trauma prediction model can be used to obtain valid predictions of attaining functional recovery after trauma at 12 months post-injury. The PRO-Trauma prediction model showed acceptable calibration and discrimination."

Other causes of neutropenia were excluded. Bone marrow morphology, clonogenic tests and/or the peripheral blood CD 34+ cell count, and apoptotic rate were evaluated in 61 patients with neutropenia lasting > 12 months or severe infections. The peripheral blood CD 34+ cell count and apoptotic rate were evaluated in five patients with shorter neutropenia. The median follow-up time was 29 months (range 7–180 months). Forty-seven patients (71.2%) had a spontaneous recovery after 7–180 months (median 29 months). The group of patients younger than 24 months at diagnosis (n = 50) had a higher probability of recovery (40/50 vs. 7/16 χ2 p<0.01) with a shorter period of neutropenia (median 26 versus 47 months, Kaplan-Meier analysis p = 0.001). The colony-forming units–granulocyte-macrophage (CFU-GM) were significantly decreased in 26/35 patients (74%) evaluated for clonogenic tests. All patients with normal CFU-GM recovered (9/9 patients); whereas, neutropenia persisted in 12/26 patients with reduced CFU-GM (46%, Pearson χ2 p = 0.02). In 36/55 (65%) patients evaluated by flow cytometry we observed reduced circulating CD34+ cells compared with controls of the same age. An increase in the circulating CD34+ cell apoptotic rate was observed in 28/55 patients (51%). Infections requiring hospitalization were observed in 9/18 (50%; Pearson χ2, p = 0.03) patients with both decreased circulating CD34+ cells and increased CD34+ apoptotic rates. In the group aged < 24 months, we observed a significant correlation between the persistence of neutropenia and decreased circulating CD34+ cells (Pearson χ2 p = 0.008). In conclusion, reduced CFU-GM and circulating hematopoietic progenitors were observed in a subgroup of children with chronic neutropenia who were positive for anti-neutrophil antibodies and had a higher incidence of severe infections and delayed spontaneous remission."

Specifically, using two real-effort laboratory tasks, we investigate how competitive prizes, social-value generation and public awards affect effort allocation decisions between the tasks. We find that all three types of incentives significantly focus effort allocation towards the task they are applied in, but the effect varies significantly between men and women. The highest effort distortion lies with competitive incentives, which is due to the effort allocation decision of men. Women exert similar amount of effort across the three incentive conditions, with slightly lower effort levels in the social-image incentivized tasks. Our results inform how and why genders differences may persist in competitive workplaces."
https://openalex.org/W2921561878,"The anti-diuretic hormone arginine vasopressin is thought to be a detrimental factor in polycystic kidney disease (PKD). We previously reported that high water intake (HWI) reduced urine osmolality and urinary arginine vasopressin, improved renal function, and reduced the kidney/body weight ratio in PCK rats, an orthologous model of human PKD. In PKD patients, however, it is reported that HWI increases total kidney volume, urine volume, and urine sodium excretion, which could be a consequence of high salt intake. In the current study, we loaded PCK rats with high salt concurrently with HWI to determine whether this human-imitated condition exacerbates disease progression. PCK rats were assigned into 4 groups: control group (CONT: distilled water), HWI group (HWI: 5% glucose in water), HWI with 0.2% NaCl group (HWI+0.2%NaCl), and HWI with 0.45% NaCl group (HWI+0.45%NaCl). Total water intake during the experimental period was increased by 1.86-, 2.02-, and 2.42-fold in HWI, HWI+0.2%NaCl, and HWI+0.45%NaCl, and sodium intake was increased by 2.55- and 5.83-fold in HWI+0.2%NaCl and HWI+0.45%NaCl, respectively, compared with CONT. Systolic blood pressure was higher in HWI+0.2%NaCl and HWI+0.45%NaCl than in both CONT and HWI. Serum urea nitrogen, kidney/body weight ratio, cAMP, cystic area, and fibrosis index were significantly lower in HWI compared with CONT, and these ameliorative effects were not abrogated in either HWI+0.2%NaCl or HWI+0.45%NaCl. The amount of sodium excreted into the urine was increased by 2.50- and 8.38-fold in HWI+0.2%NaCl and HWI+0.45%NaCl, respectively, compared with HWI. Serum sodium levels were not different between the groups. These findings indicate that the beneficial effect of HWI against the progression of cystic kidney disease was not affected even by high salt-overload in this rodent model of PKD."
https://openalex.org/W2981822756,"Among various approaches to the repeated measures analysis in crossover clinical trials, the general linear models (GLMs) with correlated errors attract substantial attention due to their simplicity in model specification, implementation, and interpretation. The goal of this research note is to conduct simulation studies to numerically investigate the impact of model misspecification in the GLMs with correlated errors in the analysis of crossover trials. A series of synthetic two-treatment and three-treatment crossover trials were designed, and simulation studies were conducted to assess how treatment effect estimation, type I error rates, and power can be affected by misspecified period effects, carryover effects, and variance-covariance structures in the GLMs. Numerical studies confirm that (i) the GLMs with terms for both carryover and period effects and with an unstructured variance-covariance matrix can provide unbiased treatment effect estimates and control of Type I error rates and that (ii) misspecification in either period effects, carryover effects, or covariance structures in the GLMs can induce inflated type I error, declined power, or biased treatment effect estimates. Although methodologic contribution of this research note is minimal, we provide practical recommendations and advice to pharmaceutical sponsors and other investigational drugs and device applicants in designing and analyzing crossover trials using the GLMs with correlated errors."
https://openalex.org/W2922511817,"Salvia splendens is a perennial, ornamental herbaceous flower that is widely cultivated as a bedding plant in gardens. The development of novel S. splendens cultivars and investigating the relevant molecular mechanisms are of great significance. In this study, RNA-sequencing and real-time PCR methods were used to analyze the possible molecular mechanism of S. splendens mutant, SX919M. From the wild-type S. splendens 919CK, we firstly selected a natural mutant, SX919M, which displayed multiple branches, clustered spheroids, and radial symmetrical inflorescence with higher numbers of calyces, ovules, stamens, and perianth tubes. Further, the RNA-seq was used to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the mutant which included a total of 3568 upregulated and 3290 downregulated unigenes. We further observed that the indole alkaloid biosynthesis pathway showed the highest DEG enrichment, which was supported by a significant increase in the IAA content in mutant SX919M. In addition, we validated three DEGs, namely, CL2200.Contig2_All encoding methyl IAA esterase, CL12462.Contig1_All and CL12462.Contig2_All, which encoded strictosidine synthase, upregulated in mutant SX919M. We selected a novel S. splendens germplasm SX919M with a high ornamental value and determined that the upregulation of IAA biogenesis may be associated with its development."
