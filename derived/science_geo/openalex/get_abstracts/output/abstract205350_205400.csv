https://openalex.org/W2014703611,"The administration of 3,4-benzpyrene to rats markedly increases the activities of certain liver microsomal enzymes which metabolize foreign compounds. Evidence based on studies of enzyme induction is presented which suggests the presence in liver microsomes of several enzymes which can catalyze the same type of reaction."

The hydrogen-sensing, platinum black-tipped catheter is uniquely sensitive in detecting the left-to-right shunts."
https://openalex.org/W2069686850,"Respiratory sinus arrhythmia in waking man is described by differential equations which relate thorax circumference acceleration to instantaneous heart rate. Consequent experiments show that the arrhythmia is initiated by stretch receptors within the thorax rather than by hemodynamic or central factors, and that it is due mainly to superimposed biphasic inspiratory heart rate transients of about 15 seconds' duration. Analysis of respiration heart rate reflex provides a new quantitative physiological tool."

https://openalex.org/W2027064418,The direct addition of indole-3-acetic acid into sterile-cultured stem pith sections of Nicotiana tabacum through inserted glass pipettes has induced cell division and differentiation where such activity would not normally occur. This evidence lends support to the theory that indole-3-acetic acid is the hormone that limits xylogenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1993297802,"EPITHELIAL mucous secretions in mammals are comprised mainly of mucosubstances1 consisting of some or all of the carbohydrates, glucosamine, galactosamine, galactose, fucose and sialic acid bound to protein2. In some secretions there are also small amounts of acidic aminopolysaccharides containing hexosamine, uronic acid and sometimes ester sulphate. Mucosubstances with the above composition, but excluding sialic acid, resemble blood-group substances, and fractions with high blood-group activity have been obtained from various secretions, including gastric juice, as well as from gastric mucosa."

https://openalex.org/W1976580513,"ESTIMATES of the MNSs gene frequencies in the English population have been based hitherto on the results of tests with anti-M, -N and -S only1,2. Recently, a supply of the very rare anti-s was made available through the kindness of Dr. J. O'Riordan of Dublin3, and a random series of 1,000 Sutton blood donors was tested with all four antisera. The samples were also tested with anti-Mia, -Vw and -Mg. All were negative with the last two antisera, but one donor was found to be Ms/Ns, Mi(a +) Vw −, and a study of her family showed Mi a to be travelling with Ns. The results of the major grouping tests are given in Table 1."

https://openalex.org/W2071084813,"IT has been shown by Walker1 that in a mouse-liver homogenate in isotonic sucrose solution by far the greater part of the β-glucuronidase activity sediments in the cytoplasmic granules (mitochondria and microsomes). It was concluded that little, if any, of the enzyme is present in the nuclei or free in the cytoplasm. This was also true of rapidly growing or regenerating liver. Within the granules the enzyme displayed only fractional activity due to its inaccessibility to substrate. In these respects β-glucuronidase, in rat liver at least, resembles a number of hydrolytic enzymes, which, it has been suggested, are enclosed together within a special type of subcellular particle, the lysosome2."

https://openalex.org/W2020296647,"THE importance of oxidative phosphorylation in the respiratory chain of living organisms has led to intensive research into the possible in vivo and in vitro mechanisms of phosphorylation1, and several theories have been advanced which postulate quinol phosphates2–4 (or analogous nitrogenous systems derived from riboflavin5,6) as the active intermediates in phosphate transfer."

This compound, of which the (−) isomer has an analgesic effect twenty times as great as that of morphine, is now undergoing clinical trials in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W2041574204,"A LARGE number of publications have dealt with the influence of the adrenal cortex on the morphology of the thymus. Adrenalectomy has been found to result in an enlargement of the thymus1,2. The administration of various preparations of adrenal cortex (in large amounts) resulted in atrophy of the thymus. This was confirmed with purified cortico-adrenal extract3, cortisone3, dehydrocorticosterone4 and deoxycorticosterone4. The same effect could be obtained with adrenocorticotrophic hormone5. Since the active fraction of the thymus can be obtained in a purified form6 and since a minute quantity of this fraction can be bioassayed7, we thought it of interest to investigate the effects of adrenalectomy on the thymus by these techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2025311826,"γ-Butyrobetaine, in comparison with its methyl ester, γ-carbomethoxypropyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide, is biologically inert. When injected into mice and insects or assayed on the frog9s rectus abdominis muscle, γ-carbomethoxypropyltrimethyl-ammonium bromide has pharmacological properties resembling those of acetylcholine. Although reported to be present in rat brain during the convulsions induced by dieldrin poisoning, γ-butyrobetaine has not been found in the nervous tissue of the roach after treatment with dieldrin."

https://openalex.org/W2069040046,"WE have investigated the characteristics of Geiger–Müller counters containing mixtures of argon with small quantities of xenon (0–7 per cent), oxygen (0–0.5 per cent) and nitrogen (∼ 1 per cent), to total pressures of 700 mm. mercury. That counters filled with this mixture would behave as ‘fast’ counters in a manner similar to organically quenched counters was first reported by Shore1, although Riedel2 reported that using the filling recommended by Shore produced no Geiger region. Using counters of the conventional ‘gamma’ type, glass bodies with cylindrical cathodes of various materials together with a 4.7 megohm series resistor and a linear amplifier of a gain of about 25, we find that optimum proportions of the gas mixture to produce the best plateaux are : xenon (3.5 per cent), oxygen (0.3 per cent), nitrogen (1.2 per cent), with argon added to give a total pressure of 700 mm. mercury. Such a mixture gave a plateau about 170 V. in length, with a starting voltage of 1,460 V. and a plateau slope of 0.02 per cent/V."

By gas-liquid chromatographic techniques, the major aroma-producing substances have been identified as isobutyl and ethyl acetate. Lesser amounts of isoamyl acetate, ethanol, and methanol were also present."
