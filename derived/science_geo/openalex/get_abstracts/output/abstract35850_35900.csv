https://openalex.org/W2087103619,"The visual cortex of many adult mammals has patches of cells that receive inputs driven by the right eye alternating with patches that receive inputs driven by the left eye. These ocular dominance patches (or ""columns"") form during early life as a consequence of competition between the activity patterns of the two eyes. A mathematical model of several biological mechanisms that can account for this development is presented. Analysis of this model reveals the conditions under which ocular dominance segregation will occur and determines the resulting patch width. Simulations of the model also exhibit other phenomena associated with early visual development, such as topographic refinement of cortical receptive fields, the confinement of input cell connections to patches, monocular deprivation plasticity including a critical period, and the effect of artificially induced strabismus. The model can be used to predict the results of proposed experiments and to discriminate among various mechanisms of plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2069825098,"Amino acid sequence of the precursor of the phosphorylated N-glycoprotein (pp63) secreted by rat hepatocytes was deduced from the cDNA sequence. This polypeptide (Mr = 40,586) was rich in both cysteine and proline and contained three potential N-glycosylation sites. A single pp63 mRNA species (approximately 2000 bp), found in normal hepatocytes but not in FaO hepatoma cells, appeared to result from transcription of a single gene. pp63 purified by affinity chromatography inhibited insulin receptor tyrosine kinase and receptor autophosphorylation. Only the phosphorylated form of the protein was active. In additon, pp63 antagonized the growth-promoting action of insulin in FaO cells but did not affect hormone-mediated increase in amino acid transport capacity or tyrosine aminotransferase induction in these cells."
https://openalex.org/W1586566732,"A new peptide family (endothelin (ET] consisting of three members in mammals appears to be present in mice according to genomic Southern blot analysis. Two ET-related genes were identified by cloning and sequence analysis of a mouse genome. One encoded a peptide identical to porcine and human vasoconstrictor peptide ET, and the other encoded a novel peptide differing from ET in 3 amino acid residues, with 4 cysteines in the same positions as in ET. This novel peptide was synthesized and confirmed to have in vivo pressor activity similar to that of ET. Northern blot analysis, however, indicated the gene of this novel peptide to be expressed only in the intestine, and not in other tissues or cell lines, or endothelial cells. Furthermore, the peptide evoked a strong contractile response in the guinea pig ileum. This peptide may thus be reasonably classified as a gastrointestinal peptide, vasoactive intestinal contractor."
https://openalex.org/W1488798457,"Human folate-binding proteins (FBPs) are single chain glycoproteins that contain a high affinity binding site for folates and methotrexate and occur in a soluble or membrane-associated form. The membrane-associated FBP is involved in the uptake of physiologic folates and methotrexate. In this study, human FBP cDNA clones were isolated from human malignant nasopharyngeal carcinoma (KB) cell and placental cDNA libraries by means of oligonucleotide probes derived from determined internal amino acid sequences. The longest cDNA nucleotide sequence is 1126 base pairs and encodes a polypeptide that contains 257 amino acid residues (calculated molecular mass = 29,817). The deduced amino acid sequence is 80% homologous to a bovine soluble FBP, is greater than 99% homologous to the reported partial amino acid sequence of the human soluble FBP, contains three potential N-linked glycosylation sites, and has hydrophobic amino- and carboxylterminal regions which are consistent with a signal peptide and a potential membrane-anchoring domain, respectively. On Northern blot analysis, radiolabeled cDNA probes hybridize to a single 1100-base pair mRNA species that is expressed to a variable degree in human KB cells, placenta, brain, and epithelial mRNA but is not detectable in human liver mRNA. In vitro translation of RNA transcripts from the FBP cDNA inserts yields a 30-kDa and a 42-kDa polypeptide in the absence and presence of microsomal membranes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1654852813,"Nucleotide sequence analysis of human and guinea pig genomic DNA encoding a new member of the insulin receptor (IR) family revealed that the predicted primary structure of this IR-related protein is as similar to the IR and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I receptor as the IR and IGF-IR are to each other. The conservation of this IR-related sequence among mammals and with the IR and IGF-IR suggests that this IR-related protein is a novel receptor for insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, or an as yet unidentified peptide hormone or growth factor belonging to the insulin family."
https://openalex.org/W1566384129,"Phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) catalyzes the first reaction in the biosynthesis from phenylalanine of a wide variety of phenylpropanoid natural products including lignin, flavonoid pigments, and phytoalexins. In bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), PAL is encoded by a family of three genes. We show here by RNase protection with gene-specific probes that these genes are expressed differentially during development and in response to different environmental cues. While all three genes are expressed at high levels in roots, only PAL1 and PAL2 are expressed in shoots and only PAL1 is expressed in leaves. Strikingly, PAL2 is expressed at very high levels in petals, where PAL1 is only very weakly expressed and PAL3 is not expressed. All three genes are induced by mechanical wounding of hypocotyls, but fungal infection only activates PAL1 and PAL3. Illumination of etiolated hypocotyls activates PAL1 and PAL2 but not PAL3. Corresponding differential patterns of synthesis of specific PAL polypeptide isoforms were observed by two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of in vitro translation products encoded by RNA isolated from hypocotyls stimulated by light, wounding, or infection. The specific isoforms encoded by transcripts of the three PAL genes were identified by inhibition of synthesis in vitro with gene-specific anti-sense transcripts followed by comparative two-dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis of the pattern of translation products. These data indicate that selective expression of PAL genes encoding functional variants is governed by a complex set of regulatory networks for developmental and environmental control of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W1588998681,"In TtT 97 cells, a thyrotropin-producing mouse pituitary tumor, thyroid hormone rapidly inhibits the transcription rate of both the thyrotropin α- and β-subunit (TSHβ) genes, and this closely parallels the increase in nuclear thyroid hormone receptor occupancy. In this study, we have identified regions of the mouse TSHβ gene which are involved in mediating tissue-specific and thyroid hormone-regulated expression. Transient expression studies were performed using a series of chimeric plasmids in which 5′-flanking DNA was ligated to the firefly luciferase gene. Following transfection by electroporation, efficient expression of TSHβ 5′-flanking luciferase constructs occurred only in cells derived from TtT 97 tumors which express the endogenous TSHβ gene. Deletion analysis demonstrated that the region of the 5′-flanking DNA between positions −271 and −80 relative to the major transcriptional start site is important for TSHβ promoter activity in thyrotropes. No expression was measurable in mouse L cells, a fibroblast line, whereas a low level of expression was seen in MGH 101A cells derived from a thyrotropic tumor which no longer expresses the TSHβ gene. Reduced expression of TSHβ constructs was also found in GH3 and GH4 pituitary tumor lines. Addition of thyroid hormone effectively inhibited the level of transient TSHβ promoter activity in TtT 97 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect was more pronounced and more accurately reflected the transcription rate data when transfected cells were derived from tumors treated with thyroid hormone for 5 days prior to transfection. Deletion of all but 46 base pairs of TSHβ gene 5′-flanking DNA and 3 base pairs of the first exon had no effect on thyroid hormone inhibition. This indicates that signals sufficient for transcriptional regulation of the TSHβ gene by thyroid hormone reside in the vicinity of the proximal promoter and may act by interfering with basal transcriptional factors."
https://openalex.org/W1543244403,"Abstract Caldesmon is a smooth muscle and nonmuscle regulatory protein that interacts with actin, myosin, tropomyosin, and calmodulin. Two overlapping clones, isolated from a chicken oviduct cDNA plasmid library and a chicken gizzard cDNA lambda NM1149 library, were used to generate a 4108-base pair sequence coding for one caldesmon. Expression of the coding sequence confirms this is one of the large smooth muscle caldesmons. The deduced protein molecular weight is 86.974, significantly less than the molecular weights estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. The protein has a high content of Gly, Lys, Arg, and Ala; there are two cysteine residues, one at either end of the molecule. Comparison with the Protein Identification Resource database demonstrates a similarity with a tropomyosin binding domain of troponin T, but none with any calmodulin or actin binding proteins. The center of the protein has an 8-fold repeat of a 13 amino acid sequence whose general motif is -Glu3-(Lys/Arg)2-Ala2-Glu2-(Lys/Arg)1-X-(Lys/Arg)1-Ala1-, where X is Glu, Gln, or Ala. Comparison with peptide sequences from a chymotryptic fragment that binds actin and calmodulin places this domain on the C terminus of caldesmon adjacent to the troponin T similarity. A tentative map of the major binding domains is proposed on the basis of available data."
https://openalex.org/W1595245947,"The chicken progesterone receptor A and B proteins differ by an additional 128 amino acids located at the N terminus of the B protein. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that these two proteins arise by alternate initiation of translation from two in-phase AUG codons located on a single mRNA transcript. Both proteins are transcriptionally active in terms of their ability to activate a progesterone-responsive target gene. These results suggest a functional significance for evolutionary conservation of two forms of this steroid receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1577909016,"Abstract The histone-like protein HU serves as an accessory factor that can facilitate the interaction of certain proteins with their specific DNA binding sites. Examples occur in different systems for prokaryotic DNA replication, transcription, and gene regulation. The protein-DNA interactions that are stimulated by HU generally involve coiling or looping of the DNA, and the possibility has been considered that HU exerts its effect by contributing flexibility to different DNA binding sites, but there has been no direct demonstration of this. To explore the possibility that HU can mediate tight DNA curvatures, we studied its effect on the formation of DNA circles when DNA ligase cyclizes short linear DNA fragments. It is demonstrated that HU greatly increases the cyclization rates of all fragments that were examined having lengths greater than 98 base pairs. Fragments of 99, 108, 120, or 126 base pairs could not cyclize in the absence of HU, but cyclization went rapidly with HU, showing that HU can mediate very tight DNA curvatures."
https://openalex.org/W1538365263,"In vitro aging at pH 7.4, 37 degrees C causes natural sequence recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH), methionyl rhGH, and human pituitary growth hormone to become substrates for bovine brain protein carboxyl methyltransferase, an enzyme that modifies the side chain alpha-carboxyl group present at atypical isoaspartyl linkages. The substrate capacity of rhGH increased at a rate of 1.8 methyl-accepting sites/day/100 molecules of hormone. Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) of trypsin digests of aged rhGH revealed two altered peptides not present in digests of control rhGH. These two fragments, which had the amino acid compositions of residues 128-134 (Leu-Glu-Asp-Gly-Ser-Pro-Arg) and 146-158 (Phe-Asp-Thr-Asn-Ser-His-Asn-Asp-Asp-Ala-Leu-Leu-Lys), contained the majority of the induced methylation sites, 22 and 58%, respectively. Isoaspartate can result from deamidation of asparagine or isomerization of aspartate. Isomerization of Asp-130, the only candidate site in 128-134, was corroborated by coelution of the altered fragment with the synthetic isoaspartyl peptide upon reversed-phase HPLC. Evidence is presented that the altered 146-158 fragment is a mixture of two peptides resulting from deamidation of Asn-149 to form 70-80% isoaspartate and 20-30% aspartate at this position. The position of isoaspartate in the altered 146-158 fragment was deduced from mass spectrometry, which indicated a single deamidated asparagine; from methylation stoichiometry, which indicated only one methylation site; and from automated Edman degradation, which showed an absence of asparagine and a low yield of aspartate at position 149. These results show that isoaspartate formation from both aspartate and asparagine is a significant, and possibly the major, source of spontaneous covalent alteration of rhGH and that enzymatic carboxyl methylation provides a powerful tool for assessing this type of modification."
https://openalex.org/W1499915655,"Abstract In the presence of MnII, H2O2, and glutathione (GSH), manganese peroxidase oxidized veratryl alcohol (I) to veratraldehyde (IV). Anisyl alcohol (II) and benzyl alcohol (III) were also oxidized by this system to their corresponding aldehydes (V and VI). In the presence of GSH, chemically prepared MnIII or gamma-irradiation also catalyzed the oxidation of I, II, and III to IV, V, and VI, respectively. GSH and dithiothreitol rapidly reduced MnIII to MnII in the absence of aromatic substrates and the dithiothreitol was oxidized to its disulfide (4,5-dihydroxyl-1,2-dithiane). These results indicate that the thiol is oxidized by enzyme-generated MnIII to a thiyl radical. The latter abstracts a hydrogen from the substrate, forming a benzylic radical which reacts with another thiyl radical to yield an intermediate which decomposes to the benzaldehyde product. In the presence of MnII, GSH, and H2O2, manganese peroxidase also oxidized 1-(4-ethoxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-2-(4'-hydroxymethyl-2'-methoxyphenoxy)- 1,3-dihydroxypropane (XII) to yield vanillyl alcohol (VII), vanillin (VIII), 1-(4-ethoxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,3-dihydroxypropane (XVI), 1-(4-ethoxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1-oxo-3-hydroxypropane (XIX), and several C alpha oxidized dimeric products. Abstraction of the C alpha (A ring) hydrogen of the dimer (XII) yields a benzylic radical, leading to C beta oxygen ether cleavage. The resultant intermediates yield the ketone (XIX) and vanillyl alcohol (VII) or vanillin (VIII). Alternatively, benzylic radical formation at the C' alpha position (B ring) leads to radical cleavage, yielding a quinone methide and a C beta radical, which yield vanillin and the 1,3-diol (XVI), respectively. In these reactions, MnIII oxidizes a thiol to a thiyl radical which subsequently abstracts a hydrogen from the substrate to form a benzylic radical. The latter undergoes nonenzymatic reactions to yield the final products."
https://openalex.org/W1603607026,"Abstract The number of phosphatidylserine molecules involved in activating protein kinase C was determined in a mixed micelle system where one monomer of protein kinase C binds to one detergent:lipid micelle of fixed composition. Unusually high cooperativity, specificity, and multiplicity in the protein kinase C-phospholipid interaction are demonstrated by examining the lipid dependence of enzymatic activity. The rates of autophosphorylation and substrate (histone) phosphorylation are specifically regulated by the phosphatidylserine content of the micelles. Hill coefficients of 8-11 were calculated for phosphatidylserine-dependent stimulation of enzyme activity, with a maximum occurring in micelles containing greater than or equal to 12 phosphatidylserine molecules. The high specificity that exists is illustrated by the fact that phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol, but not phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidic acid, can replace only some of the phosphatidylserine molecules. We propose that Ca2+ and acidic phospholipids cause the protein to undergo a conformation change revealing multiple phosphatidylserine binding sites and resulting in the highly cooperative and specific interaction of protein kinase C with phosphatidylserine. Consistent with this, the proteolytic sensitivity of protein kinase C increases approximately 10-fold in the presence of phosphatidylserine and Ca2+ compared to Ca2+ alone. The high degree of cooperativity and specificity may provide a sensitive method for the physiological regulation of protein kinase C by phospholipid."
https://openalex.org/W1564064803,"Abstract The specificity of the phospholipid cofactor requirement of rat brain protein kinase C was investigated using Triton X-100 mixed micellar methods. Sixteen analogues of phosphatidylserine were prepared and tested for their ability to support protein kinase C activity, [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding, and protein kinase C binding to mixed micelles. Phosphatidylserinol, -L-serine methyl ester, -N-acetyl-L-serine, -2-hydroxyacetate, -3-hydroxypropionate, and -4-hydroxybutyrate did not activate protein kinase C in mixed micelles containing 2 mol % of sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol. This indicates that both the carboxyl and amino moieties are important for activation. Phosphatidyl-D-serine and -L-homoserine were incapable of supporting full activation; this demonstrates stereospecificity and the importance of the distance between the phosphate and carboxyl and amino moieties. Since 1,2-rac-phosphatidyl-L-serine and 1,3-phosphatidyl-L-serine fully supported protein kinase C activity, the stereochemistry within the glycerol backbone at the interface was not necessary for maximal activation. Neither lysophosphatidyl-L-serine nor 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine supported protein kinase C activity implying that the interfacial conformation is critical to the activation process. The phospholipid dependencies of [3H]phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate binding and of protein kinase C binding to mixed micelles containing sn-1,2-dioleoylglycerol did not mirror those for activation. The data demonstrate that protein kinase C possesses a high degree of specificity with respect to phospholipid activation and implicate several functional groups within the phospho-L-serine polar head group in binding and activation."
https://openalex.org/W1517784889,"Abstract Thyroid hormone regulation of the human thyrotropin beta-subunit gene (TSH beta) was examined in a human embryonal cell line (293). Transient expression studies were performed with chimeric plasmids containing the reporter gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. Sequences in the first exon between +9 and +37 base pairs (bp) enhanced gene expression from the human TSH beta promoter in the absence of thyroid hormone as well as mediated a concentration-dependent triiodothyronine (L-T3) decrease in gene expression. Thyroid hormone inhibition of expression was also conferred to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter by inserting +3 to +37 bp of the human TSH beta gene downstream from the start of transcription. Primer extension analysis of RNA from transfected cell cultures revealed accurate transcription initiation in only those constructs which contained sequences between +9 and +37 bp. Moreover, RNA analysis confirmed that L-T3 inhibition of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity from chimeric pTSH beta CAT constructs occurred at a pretranslational level. In addition, a nuclear thyroid hormone receptor, c-erbA-beta, bound to this region in an avidin-biotin DNA binding assay. These data suggest that L-T3, bound to its receptor, may inhibit human TSH beta expression by interfering with an element that functions to enhance gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1524776434,"Abstract The minimal structure in the heat-stable inhibitor protein of cAMP-dependent protein kinase required for a low nanomolar potency of inhibition is the peptide Thr6-Tyr-Ala-Asp-Phe-Ile-Ala-Ser-Gly-Arg-Thr-Gly-Arg-Arg-Asn-Ala-+ ++Ile22-NH2 (PKI-(6-22)-amide). While primary structural determinants for interaction with the protein kinase are distributed throughout the 17 residues of this peptide, we have previously shown that phenylalanine 10 in the NH2-terminal portion is a particularly important determinant for high affinity binding (Glass, D. B., Cheng, H.-C., Mende-Mueller, L., Reed, J., and Walsh, D. A. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 8802-8810). To investigate this requirement further, peptide analogs of PKI-(6-22)-amide in which various natural and nonstandard amino acids are substituted for phenylalanine 10 have been synthesized and tested for inhibitory potency against the catalytic subunit of the protein kinase. Consistent with the importance of the hydrophobicity of phenylalanine, an alanine 10 substitution analog exhibited a 270-fold decrease in inhibitory potency, whereas the leucine 10 analog lost only 33-fold in activity as compared to the parent peptide PKI-(6-22)-amide. Peptides containing the spatial conformation analogs D-phenylalanine, homophenylalanine, or phenylglycine were 60-120-fold less potent than the parent peptide. Peptides containing various para-substituted phenylalanines at position 10 were only 5-11-fold less potent. One exception to this was (4'-azidophenylalanine 10)PKI-(6-22)-amide, which was nearly equipotent with the parent inhibitor. The most potent analogs were those peptides containing highly aromatic residues at position 10. The 2'-thienylalanine 10, tryptophan (formyl) 10, tryptophan 10, and the 1'-naphthylalanine 10 analogs were 3-fold less potent, equipotent, slightly more potent, and 4-fold more potent than the parent peptide inhibitor, respectively. We conclude that phenylalanine 10 in PKI-(6-22)-amide, and presumably in the native protein inhibitor, interacts through specific hydrophobic and/or aromatic binding to a hydrophobic pocket or cleft near the active site of the protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2132223750,"Abstract A novel aminopeptidase active toward D-amino acid-containing peptides, D-amino acid amides, and D-amino acid esters has been purified 2,800-fold to homogeneity from a bacterium Ochrobactrum anthropi SCRC C1-38, which had been isolated from soil. The enzyme has a molecular weight of about 122,000 and is composed of two identical subunits (Mr = 59,000). The optimal pH for activity was 8.0. It showed strict D-stereospecificity toward substrates including low molecular weight D-amino acid amides such as D-alanine amide, D-alpha-aminobutyric acid amides, and D-serine amide; D-alanine N-alkylamides such as D-alanine-p-nitroanilide, D-alanine benzylamide, and D-alanine n-butylamide; and peptides with a D-alanine at the NH2 terminus such as D-alanylglycine, D-alanylglycylglycine, D-alanyl-L-alanyl-L-alanine, and D-alanine oligomers. Generally, the enzyme did not act on substrates composed of L-amino acid at the NH2 terminus, although it showed low stereospecificity only toward substrates such as the methyl esters of L-alanine, L-serine, and L-alanine-p-nitroanilide. Comparing the Km and Vmax values for the major substrates, it is clear that the enzyme prefers peptides to amino acid arylamides or amino acid amides. The enzyme was tentatively named as D-aminopeptidase. EDTA and divalent cations have no effect on the enzyme activity. The enzyme appears to be a thiol peptidase."

https://openalex.org/W1585374470,"The isolation of an acidic protein, pI 4.5, that is abundant in turkey gizzard is described. Its apparent molecular weight measured by electrophoretic procedures is 24,000. This protein is phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase and one phosphorylation site is indicated. From sequence determinations of tryptic peptides it is concluded that this protein is closely related to the C-terminal part of smooth muscle myosin light chain kinase. The initiation site for the protein is to the C-terminal side of the calmodulin-binding site. From the sequence data an estimated molecular weight is 18,000. This protein is expressed independently, as indicated by a blocked N terminus, and is probably the translation product of the 2.7-kilobase RNA detected previously in chicken gizzard (Guerriero, V., Jr., Russo, M. A., Olson, N. J., Putkey, J. A., and Means, A. R. (1986) Biochemistry 25, 8372-8381).

https://openalex.org/W1501916493,"We have previously reported that troponin T (TnT), a regulatory protein in muscle contraction, undergoes a switch from the larger, acidic embryonic form to the smaller, basic adult form during rat heart development (Jin, J.-P., and Lin, J.J.-C. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 7309-7315). To investigate the significance and the molecular mechanism of this isoform switching, cDNA clones encoding rat cardiac TnT were obtained by screening a cDNA library constructed from young rat cardiac poly(A)+ RNAs using the expression vector lambda gt11. Clone RCT10 proved to be a full length clone containing 50 base pairs (bp) of 5'-untranslated sequence, 870 bp of coding sequence, and 196 bp plus poly(A) tail at the 3'-untranslated region. In the other cDNA clone (RCT11), the entire 3'-untranslated sequence and most of the coding sequence were identical with that of RCT10, but an additional 30-bp insert was present in the coding region from residues 18 to 27. This insertion sequence appeared to code for a fragment (EDWSEEEEDE) highly enriched in acidic amino acid residues. Thus, RCT11 might represent a clone encoding the embryonic isoform of rat cardiac TnT. S1 nuclease RNA mapping analysis using end-labeled RCT11 cDNA probes confirmed that this region of the sequence is different in embryonic and adult isoform mRNAs. These results suggest that both embryonic and adult isoforms of rat cardiac TnT are generated from the same primary transcript by developmentally regulated alternative splicing. The amino acid sequence deduced from RCT10 cDNA exhibits 87%, 85%, and 72% homology with bovine, rabbit, and chicken cardiac TnTs, respectively, but less homology (57-59%) with the known skeletal TnTs from human, rat, rabbit, and chicken. Moreover, both the 5'- and the 3'-untranslated sequences of rat cardiac TnT mRNA are completely different from those reported for rat skeletal TnT mRNA, suggesting that rat cardiac TnT is coded from a gene distinct from the rat skeletal TnT gene."
https://openalex.org/W1497265739,"This report describes the preparation of a library of oligosaccharide probes (neoglycolipids) from N-glycosylated proteins, characterization of the probes by liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry, and investigation of their reactions with 125I-labeled bovine serum conglutinin by chromatogram binding assays. The results, together with additional binding studies using neoglycolipids derived from purified complex type bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary oligosaccharides from urine, or their glycosidase-treated products, have shown that the combining specificity of conglutinin includes structures not only on high mannose-type oligosaccharides but also on hybrid- and complex-type chains. With high mannose-type oligosaccharides there is increased reactivity from the Man5 to the Man8 structures, indicating a preference for the terminal Man α1–2 sequence. With complex- and hybrid-type oligosaccharides, the requirements for binding are the presence of nonreducing terminal N-acetylglucosamine or mannose residues, but the presence of a bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue may inhibit binding. From these results it is deduced that the reactivity of conglutinin with the complement glycopeptide iC3b rather than the intact glycoprotein C3 is due to the oligosaccharide accessibility rendered by proteolysis in the complement cascade."
https://openalex.org/W1554943252,"Abstract The T-cell antigen receptor is a multisubunit complex consisting of at least seven chains. Based upon structural and genetic considerations, we have divided these chains into three groups. The alpha and beta subunits (Ti) are the clonotypic chains responsible for antigen recognition. Three chains that are invariant among all T-cells define the CD3 complex. These include the CD3 gamma, delta, and epsilon chains. The zeta chain is a distinct component that, like the CD3 chains, is invariant among all T-cells. In the majority of receptors, zeta is found as a disulfide-linked homodimer. We have recently shown that approximately 10% of zeta is disulfide-linked to a chain which we have called eta. A preliminary model has been proposed, suggesting that there are two subclasses of receptors, depending upon the presence within the complex of either the zeta-zeta homodimer or the zeta-eta heterodimer. Evidence has been presented that these two subclasses may perform distinct signaling functions. In this paper the eta chain is characterized to determine whether it is structurally related to the zeta chain and, in particular, whether it might represent a post-translational modification of zeta. We can identify specific antigenic epitopes that are shared by both zeta and eta. However, not all antibodies raised against zeta can directly recognize eta. The apparent molecular mass of eta is 22 kDa, whereas zeta has a molecular mass of 16 kDa. We are unable to demonstrate any post-translational covalent modifications of eta to explain the difference in apparent molecular weight. These include phosphorylation, glycosylation, or sulfation. Amino acid incorporation studies demonstrate that the amino acid composition of eta is distinct from that of zeta. All of the eta in a T-cell is found in association with the rest of the components of the T-cell receptor. In addition, our anti-eta antibodies allow us to directly recognize human eta, which has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 23 kDa. Thus, eta and zeta appear to be related but distinct proteins, and we would propose that eta is the second member of the zeta group of components of the T-cell receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1515462367,"Abstract In addition to lamins A, B, and C (Gerace, L., Blum, A., and Blobel, G. (1978) J. Cell Biol. 79, 546-566), the rat liver nuclear lamina has recently been shown to contain two higher molecular weight (70,000-75,000, pI 5.7-5.8) quantitatively less prominent nuclear polypeptides (Lehner, C.F., Kurer, V., Eppenberger, H. M., and Nigg, E. A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 13293-13301). In the present study two-dimensional tryptic peptide mapping and Western blotting with affinity-purified chicken and human sera have been utilized to examine the structural relationships and the tissue distribution of these quantitatively less prominent mammalian lamins (termed lamins D and E in this study). Lamins D and E have indistinguishable one- and two-dimensional proteolytic maps. Whereas the one-dimensional proteolytic maps of lamins D and E show several degradation products which are of similar molecular mass to polypeptides seen in one-dimensional proteolytic maps of lamins A, B, and C, the two-dimensional tryptic maps of D and E are distinct from those of lamins A, B, and C, suggesting that lamins D and E are produced by transcription of one or more unique genes. Nonetheless, affinity-purified anti-D/E antibodies (raised against lamin E) cross-react with lamin B, suggesting the presence of a shared epitope. Moreover, a human autoantibody cross-reacts with all five lamins after affinity elution from any of the five, suggesting the presence of another epitope which is shared by all five polypeptides. All five lamins were undetectable in rodent epididymal sperm. In contrast, lamins D and E were readily detected in a variety of rat somatic tissues (liver, kidney, prostate, brain, heart) including lymphoid cells, a cell type depleted of lamins A and C. During mitogenic stimulation of lymphocytes, the signal for lamins A and C increased 5-fold, the signal for lamins D and E increased 2-fold, but the signal for lamin B remained unchanged, suggesting that levels of lamins D and E are regulated independently from those of the major lamins."

The oxidation of malonate and methylmalonate semialdehydes by this enzyme is CoA-dependent, the products being acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA, respectively. Expected activity with ethylmalonate semialdehyde as substrate was not found. Methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase was separated on DEAE-Sephacel into two isoforms which differ in mobility during nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The two forms are immunologically cross-reactive and exhibit the same N-terminal sequence, suggesting that one form is the product of the other. The monomer molecular mass, determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, was 58 kDa. The native molecular mass, estimated by gel filtration, was 250 kDa, suggesting a tetrameric structure."
https://openalex.org/W1605840656,"Abstract The porphobilinogen deaminase gene encodes the third enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway. This gene is expressed in a tissue-specific manner and gives rise to two isoenzymatic forms encoded by mRNA species differing in their 5' extremity. Recent studies in human demonstrated that the tissue-specific expression of the porphobilinogen deaminase gene is determined in erythropoietic cells, by the utilization of a specific promoter situated 3' to the housekeeping promoter used in other cell types. This results, through differential splicing, in the mutually exclusive presence of either exon 1 or exon 2 in mature mRNAs. Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of the porphobilinogen deaminase gene from mouse. The overall organization of the mouse gene is similar to that of the human one. In the housekeeping promoter, only a short stretch of homology is found including two potential Sp1 binding sites; in contrast, more extensive similarity appears in the erythroid-specific promoter including two motifs also found in globin gene, a CACCC box, and a recently described Ery F1 consensus binding sequence. We derived a set of single-stranded probes corresponding to different parts of the mouse gene to carry out a detailed analysis of the transcriptional unit in various cell types, using a run-on transcription assay on isolated nuclei. In liver cells, the first (non-erythropoietic) exon is more actively transcribed than parts of the gene situated downstream, suggesting that the elongation of transcripts is blocked within the 5' part of the first intron. In erythropoietic cells, the downstream promoter becomes activated; surprisingly, the initiation of transcription is also enhanced from the upstream (housekeeping) promoter and most of the transcripts initiated at the housekeeping promoter stop downstream of the first exon, between the two promoters."
https://openalex.org/W1613409465,"Proteoglycan biosynthesis was studied in human monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM) after exposure to typical activators of the monocyte/macrophage system: interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). By morphological examination, both monocytes and MDM were stimulated by these activators. Treatment with IFN-gamma resulted in a slight decrease in the expression of [35S]chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (CSPG) in both monocytes and MDM, whereas LPS treatment increased the [35S]CSPG expression 1.8 and 2.2 times, respectively. PMA, in contrast, decreased the CSPG expression 0.4 times in monocytes, whereas MDM were stimulated to increase the biosynthesis 1.9 times. An increase in the sulfate density of the chondroitin sulfate chains was evident following differentiation of monocytes into MDM due to the expression of disulfated disaccharide units of the chondroitin sulfate E type (CS-E). However, monocytes exposed to PMA did also express disaccharides of the chondroitin sulfate E type. Furthermore, the expression of CS-E in MDM was increased 2 times following PMA treatment. An inactive phorbol ester, phorbol 12,13-diacetate, did not affect the expression of CS-E in either monocytes or MDM when compared with control cultures, suggesting that protein kinase C-dependent signal pathways may be involved in the regulation of sulfation of CSPG. Exposure to LPS or IFN-gamma did not lead to any changes in the sulfation of the chondroitin sulfate chains."
https://openalex.org/W1559438128,"Abstract Using the UVRABC nuclease as a reagent coupled with DNA restriction and hybridization analysis we have developed a method to quantify N-acetoxy-2-acetylaminofluorene (NAAAF)-induced DNA damage in the coding and noncoding sequences of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. High performance liquid chromatography analysis shows that the only DNA adduct formed in NAAAF-treated CHO cells is N-(deoxyguanosine-C8-yl)-2-aminofluorene (dG-C8-AF). DNA sequencing analysis demonstrates that the UVRABC nuclease incises at all potential sites in which dG-C8-AF adduct may form in linear DNA fragments. We have found that the formation and removal of dG-C8-AF adducts in the coding and 3' downstream noncoding sequences of the DHFR domain are similar in cells treated with 10 microM NAAAF (3.1 adducts/14 kilobases); DNA adduct removal attains 70% for both sequences within 24 h. This result contrasts with that obtained for the repair of cyclobutane dipyrimidines in the DHFR gene, in which the repair efficiency is much higher in the coding region than in the 3' downstream noncoding region. Our results suggest that in CHO cells the repair pathway for aminofluorene DNA adducts is not the same as that for cyclobutane dipyrimidines. This new technique has the potential to detect a variety of chemical carcinogen induced DNA adducts at the gene level in cultured cells and in DNA isolated from animal tissues."

https://openalex.org/W1578242789,Abstract We have recently described an 18-kilodalton polypeptide (p18) that is present in much greater abundance in acute leukemic blast cells (myeloid and lymphoid) than in resting or proliferating nonleukemic lymphoid cells or chronic lymphoid and myeloid leukemic cells. In this report we describe the cloning of two different sized full-length cDNAs that code for p18. The two cDNAs differ in their 3'-noncoding regions as a result of alternative polyadenylation. Analysis of the complete nucleotide sequence and the corresponding amino acid sequence did not reveal significant homology to any previously described sequences. We show evidence that this gene is highly conserved in several animal species and low stringency hybridization studies suggest that the p18 gene may be a member of a family of partially homologous genes in the human genome.
https://openalex.org/W1515360022,"A 2-kilobase fragment from the 5′-flanking region of the human myoglobin gene extending from −2038 to +7 relative to the cap site regulates expression of a heterologous reporter gene in a cell-specific and developmentally regulated manner. Functional analyses of 5′ and internal deletions indicate that sequences located between −261 and −205 are essential for muscle-specific expression in cooperation with the myoglobin core promoter. A 167-base pair fragment containing these sequences (−371 to −205) enhances expression from myoglobin core promoter elements in a manner that is independent of its orientation and position relative to the cap site. When linked to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter, this 167-base pair fragment of the myoglobin gene also enhances expression in differentiated myotubes but not in undifferentiated myoblasts or fibroblasts. Nucleotide sequences within the region that is essential for enhancing activity (−261 to −205) are conserved in other mammalian myoglobin genes (seal, mouse) and resemble sequences within control regions of other genes that are expressed selectively in striated myocytes. These data indicate that the 5′-flanking region of the human myoglobin gene contains an enhancer-like element that is important for transcriptional activation during myocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1587033309,"Abstract Heparin cofactor II (HCII) is a highly specific serine proteinase inhibitor, which complexes covalently with thrombin in a reaction catalyzed by heparin and other polyanions. The molecular basis for the thrombin specificity may be explained by the identification here of a segment of HCII including residues 54-75 that binds to thrombin. A synthetic peptide, HCII(54-75), based on this segment of HCII, Gly-Glu-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Leu-Glu- Lys-Ile-Phe-Ala-Glu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Tyr-Ile-Asp inhibited thrombin's cleavage of fibrinogen. Clotting activity of thrombin was inhibited 50% at a concentration of 28 microM. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that HCII(54-75) inhibited thrombin's cleavage of both the A alpha and B beta polypeptides in fibrinogen. However, the peptide did not block thrombin's active site, as hydrolysis of chromogenic substrates was not inhibited. HCII(54-75) probably binds to the same site on thrombin as do carboxyl-terminal residues of hirudins, thrombin inhibitors of leeches. HCII(54-75) inhibited binding of thrombin to a synthetic peptide corresponding to residues 54-66 of hirudin PA, but the hirudin peptide was about 30-fold more potent in binding and clotting assays. Both synthetic peptides, as a result of their polyanionic character, might be expected to stimulate the reaction of HCII with thrombin. However, the hirudin-related peptide inhibited this reaction, suggesting that it blocked a site on thrombin required for interaction with HCII. HCII(54-75) had a net stimulatory effect on the thrombin-HCII reaction as a consequence of its lower affinity for thrombin and greater negative charge relative to the hirudin-related peptide. These studies suggest that residues 54-75 of HCII interact with a noncatalytic binding site on thrombin and that this interaction contributes to efficient inhibition of thrombin by HCII."
https://openalex.org/W1509725445,"A massive proliferation of peroxisomes occurs in the yeast Candida boidinii when methanol is utilized as the sole carbon source; these peroxisomes contain the enzymes which catalyze the initial steps of methanol utilization. The most abundant peroxisomal membrane-associated protein has an apparent molecular mass of 20 kDa and is termed PMP20. We report the isolation of two genes that encode very similar forms of PMP20; this is the first report of genes that encode proteins associated with peroxisomal membranes. Southern analysis demonstrates that the two genes are on different loci, although there are several homologous regions of both 5'- and 3'-untranslated sequence. One of the areas of 5' homology is within the untranslated region of the mRNA. Within the coding region there are 35 base differences between the two genes that are reflected in only five amino acid differences. The mRNAs representing both genes of PMP20 are induced in cells grown in methanol-containing medium and are below detection in cells grown in glucose. S1 nuclease protection analysis indicates that there is a 2.5-fold difference in mRNA expression between the two genes when induced. The predicted sequences of both PMP20 genes show the absence of a cleaved amino-terminal leader sequence and the presence of only 1 cysteine residue. In agreement with previous biochemical data suggesting a peripheral association of this protein with the membrane (Goodman, J. M., Maher, J., Silver, P. A., Pacifico, A., and Sanders, D. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 3464-3468), there are no obvious membrane spanning regions predicted in the sequences. Both PMP20 gene products contain the carboxyl-terminal sequence AKL, similar to the putative SKL peroxisomal sorting sequence (Gould, S. J., Keller, G.-A., and Subramani, S. (1988) J. Cell Biol. 107, 897-905)."
https://openalex.org/W1537524289,"Cancer has two fundamental features: neoplasia, representing the aberrant expression of a normal cell proliferation response, and malignancy, an ability to penetrate normal tissue boundaries. Although the role of oncogenes in neoplastic transformation is becoming clearer, malignancy remains far less well understood. Normal rat fibroblasts exhibit a staged response to anoxia which, if expressed in an uncontrolled fashion, may contribute vital aspects to the malignant phenotype. The response begins with induction of retrotransposon-like VL30 element transcription, progresses through induction of several intracellular proteins, and is followed by secretion of three major proteins including the protease cathepsin L. The induced VL30 element RNA encodes a 61-kDa secretory protein of unknown function. The response of fibroblasts to anoxia is evidently not a survival response. Instead, the response represents a close match to the role of fibroblasts during the early stages of wound healing where they are active under near-anoxic conditions. Malignant cancer cells are known to exhibit several of the characteristics we find induced in fibroblasts by anoxia. Conversion to the malignant phenotype may represent coordinate loss of control of this normal cellular response."
https://openalex.org/W1573404455,"Abstract To separate the interfacial and catalytic reactions of lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), we carried out the first investigation of its reaction with water-soluble substrates. We used a continuous spectrophotometric assay for the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids to determine the chain length specificity of the enzyme and its modulation by anions and apolipoproteins in solution. By chemical modification of amino acid residues, we demonstrated that the active site serine and histidine residues participate in both the esterase and acyltransferase reactions but that cysteine residues are not involved in the esterase reaction. The kinetics of the LCAT reaction were measured for p-nitrophenyl esters of fatty acids having up to six (C-6) carbons in length. With increasing acyl chain lengths the optimal reaction rates occurred for the C-5 ester and Km and Vmax values decreased progressively, while the specificity constant, kcat/Km, increased. The same series of substrates and longer chain esters, up to C-16, were also reacted with LCAT in the presence of Triton X-100 in order to determine the general trends for the reaction rates as a function of chain length. The observed trends for the reaction rates and kinetic constants were attributed to an increasing binding affinity for the longer acyl chains in a large hydrophobic cavity, with a concomitant restriction in the motions of the substrates and a decreased probability for the correct positioning of the ester bond for hydrolysis, resulting in a decreased substrate turnover. Since the kinetics of the interfacial reactions of LCAT are very sensitive to the presence of anions and apolipoproteins, in particular apoA-I, we investigated the effects of these modulators on the reactions of LCAT in solution. Unlike the interfacial reactions, the hydrolysis of the p-nitrophenyl esters was not affected by 0.1 M concentrations of anions nor by water-soluble apolipoproteins (apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoCs). Thus the regulation of the activity of LCAT is mediated largely by the interfaces on which it acts."

https://openalex.org/W44418652,"Histone proteins, which were assembled into chromatin using the Xenopus oocyte S-150 extract, were analyzed on acid-urea gels and Triton-acid-urea gels to determine their state of modification. We find that histone H4, which is present in a diacetylated form in the oocyte S-150, gradually loses its acetate groups as the DNA is packaged into chromatin. Thus, this process parallels the one observed in vivo during chromatin formation in growing eucaryotic cells. Histone H4 deacetylation in the oocyte S-150 is a DNA-dependent reaction. This reaction is blocked when butyrate (an inhibitor of histone deacetylase) is added at the onset of the chromatin assembly process. When butyrate is added at the end of the assembly process, no de novo acetylation of the nucleosomal histone H4 is observed. Chromatin with regularly spaced nucleosomes, displaying periodicities ranging from 160 to 220 base pairs, can be assembled in vitro with the oocyte S-150 (Rodriguez-Campos, A., Shimamura, A., and Worcel, A. (1989) J. Mol. Biol., in press). This chromatin may contain either deacetylated histone H4 when assembled under standard conditions or diacetylated H4 when assembled in the presence of butyrate. Both types of chromatin display identical structures upon digestion with nucleases. The potential applications of this system toward the study of the naturally occurring diacetylated histone H4 are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1482664330,"Synovial tissue hyperplasia in basic calcium phosphate deposition disease has been suggested to develop through the stimulation of cell growth by basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals deposited in joints. These crystals have been used in vitro to stimulate DNA synthesis in quiescent fibroblasts to experimentally study this proliferative disease. The stimulation of DNA synthesis, in density-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cells, by BCP crystals was inhibited after down-regulating protein kinase C activity with 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol 13-acetate (TPA). No effect on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulated DNA synthesis was observed under the same conditions. The expression of c-myc and c-fos increased in response to BCP stimulation in a manner similar to the increase produced by stimulation with PDGF. The BCP stimulation of c-fos and c-myc messages was inhibited 60 and 90%, respectively, in TPA-pretreated, protein kinase C-down-regulated cells. The induction of these transcripts by PDGF was unaffected in cells pretreated with TPA. TPA was unable to stimulate c-fos and c-myc expression or DNA synthesis following protein kinase C down-regulation. Both PDGF and TPA stimulated phosphorylation of an 80-kDa protein, whereas BCP crystals had no effect on phosphorylation of this protein. The exposure of density-arrested Balb/c 3T3 cells to BCP crystals had no effect on high affinity epidermal growth factor receptor binding under conditions in which PDGF and TPA reduced epidermal growth factor binding. The data suggest that PDGF can act to stimulate c-fos and c-myc expression as well as DNA synthesis through a protein kinase C-independent pathway, whereas BCP crystals require at least endogenous levels of protein kinase C to stimulate these events."
https://openalex.org/W2118134790,"Abstract The purpose of this investigation was to develop immunologic probes to prolactin-like protein A (PLP-A) that could be used to characterize the protein and its distribution in various tissues. Five oligopeptides corresponding to different regions of the predicted PLP-A amino acid sequence (peptides 1-13, 62-76, 101-114, 129-145, and 152-164) were chemically synthesized by solid phase methodology. The peptides were purified to homogeneity by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography and coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The peptide-keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugates were used to immunize rabbits. Immune responses were monitored by enzyme-linked immunoassay. Reactivity of the antipeptide antisera with placental proteins was determined by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation analyses. All of the peptides except peptide 1-13 yielded significant immune responses. Antisera to peptides 101-114, 129-145, and 152-164 each specifically recognized proteins of Mr 29,000 and 33,000 from cytosol preparations of rat placental tissue and showed limited or no cross-reactivity with other members of the prolactin-growth hormone family. Three experiments were performed to determine whether the Mr 29,000 and 33,000 species were glycosylated derivatives of an Mr 25,000 precursor. Treatment of placental cytosolic preparations with N-Glycanase prior to immunoblotting resulted in the identification of only an Mr 25,000 species. It was also determined that the Mr 29,000 and 33,000 species specifically bound to concanavalin A. Furthermore, tunicamycin shifted the synthesis of PLP-A by placental explants from the Mr 29,000 and 33,000 forms to the Mr 25,000 species. The Mr 29,000 and 33,000 species were identified in serum obtained from pregnant and fetal rats but not in serum from nonpregnant females or males. We conclude that PLP-A is expressed in rat placenta. An Mr 25,000 precursor (predicted from PLP-A cDNA and these results) is glycosylated to either the Mr 29,000 or 33,000 form, both of which predominate in placenta and in circulation."

Comparison of pituitary extracts and purified bST by Western blot analysis of two-dimensional gels suggested that the immunoreactive somatotropin species present in the extract were also present in the purified material, with no significant losses or degradation as a result of the purification method. NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicated the presence of equal quantities of Ala-Phe-Pro-Ala-Met-Ser-Leu-Ser- and Phe-Pro-Ala-Met-Ser-Leu-Ser- sequences. The Met-Ser-Leu-Ser-NH2-terminal sequence, a degradation product observed in NIH standard lots, was not detected. Assay of bioactivity in a bovine liver receptor-binding assay and in a female rat growth assay showed pituitary bST and recombinant methionyl-bovine somatotropin to be equipotent. Tryptic maps and sequence analysis of pituitary-derived somatotropin suggest the presence of isoaspartate derivatization at Asp128."

The compositions of the two compounds were determined by releasing the acyl components by exhaustive acid-catalyzed methanolysis and identifying them as their methyl esters by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The sugar component was identified by converting it to the alditol acetate derivative of glucosamine in a two-step reduction and identifying it as such by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The linkages of the fatty acyl components to the sugar residue and the configuration of the sugar component was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The complete structures of the two compounds were further confirmed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. It is still unsure whether the de-O-acylated derivative was formed from the di-acyl compound by de-O-acylation during acid hydrolysis. These structures represent the first report of 2-amino-2-deoxy-gluco-hexuronic acid in the free lipid A of a Gram-negative bacterium and confirms our earlier contention (Hollingsworth, R.I., and Carlson, R.

https://openalex.org/W1589637358,"Abstract The polypyrimidine tract, located at the 3' end of intron 1 of the adenovirus major late transcript, was studied for its role in splicing using cell-free preparations isolated from HeLa cells. A plasmid (pIz) was constructed in which seven purine bases were substituted for pyrimidine bases within the 14-nucleotide polypyrimidine sequence. Runoff transcripts extending to the middle of intron 2 were tested for their ability to support in vitro splicing. The efficiency of these reactions was compared with pre-mRNA transcripts made from the wild-type nonmutated plasmid (p1-2). Neither spliced products nor splicing intermediates were detected in reactions with the pIz pre-mRNA. The formation of the nucleoprotein complexes involved in splicing was examined with this altered pre-mRNA. No 55 S splicing complex was detected and only low levels of the 30 S presplicing complex formed (30-fold less than with wild-type pre-mRNA). However, when a longer runoff transcript was prepared from the polypyrimidine mutated plasmid pIz, spliced RNA was formed. This activity required specific downstream sequences, since transcripts produced from pIz which contained substituted downstream sequences were not spliced. Although intron 2 of the adenovirus major late transcript does not contain a discernible 3' polypyrimidine sequence, pre-mRNA (p2-3) containing this intron was efficiently spliced. However, when the 3' region of intron 2 was substituted for the polypyrimidine sequence of intron 1, the resulting pre-mRNA did not support efficient splicing in vitro. However, when the polypyrimidine sequence of intron 1 was substituted for the sequence at the 3' end of intron 2, efficient splicing occurred, and the rate of formation of splicing intermediates and the accumulation of nucleoprotein complexes was greater than with the wild-type pre-mRNA (p2-3)."
https://openalex.org/W1553228079,"The abundance and distribution of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) oligomeric forms expressed in skeletal muscle is strongly dependent upon the activity state of the cells. In this study, we examined several stages of AChE biogenesis to determine which ones were regulated by muscle activity. Inhibiting spontaneous contraction of tissue-cultured quail myotubes with tetrodotoxin (TTX) reduces AChE activity by approximately 30% of the levels found in actively contracting cells. This decrease is due primarily to the loss of 20 S asymmetric (collagen-tailed) AChE from TTX-treated cultures and is reflected in reduced pool sizes for both cell surface and intracellular AChE molecules. Using monoclonal anti-AChE antibodies to immunoprecipitate and quantify isotopically labeled enzyme molecules, we show that AChE down-regulation by TTX is not mediated through changes in the rates of synthesis or degradation of AChE polypeptide chains. Newly synthesized AChE polypeptides acquire enzymatic activity at the same rate in TTX-treated cultures as in actively contracting cells, however, a larger percentage of catalytically active dimers and tetramers are secreted from TTX-treated cultures compared with controls. These results suggest that TTX-induced down-regulation of asymmetric AChE occurs at the level of assembly of globular AChE molecules with collagen-like tail subunits in the Golgi apparatus, rather than through changes in the availability of catalytic subunits. Thus, post-translational mechanisms appear to play an important role in regulating the abundance and distribution of this important synaptic component in skeletal muscle."
https://openalex.org/W1545547870,"We have studied the kinetics of breakage of apurinic (AP) sites by the intercalating agent 9-aminoellipticine using fluorimetric methods with single (ss)- and double (ds)-stranded apurinic DNA. In order to understand the chemical process, high performance liquid chromatography was used to follow the reaction kinetics with the apurinic oligonucleotide model T(AP)T. The unstable intermediate, which is responsible for the beta-elimination step, is a Schiff base resulting from the interaction of the amino group of the aromatic amine with the aldehyde function of the deoxyribose moiety (AP site). Fluorescence occurs simultaneously with the breakage of both ss and ds DNA and of the oligonucleotide and arises from the formation of a conjugated double bond on the Schiff base through the beta-elimination reaction. In optimal conditions, the second order rate constant for the fluorescence build up is 15 x 10(3) min-1 M-1 for ds DNA and 0.105 x 10(3) min-1 M-1 for T(AP)T. The ability of 9-aminoellipticine to induce fluorescence and breakage of ss DNA and T(AP)T shows that intercalation is not essential for this reaction to occur. Nevertheless, the greater rate constant with DNA suggests that stacking is an important parameter for the reaction of the aromatic amine with the AP site."

https://openalex.org/W1561435461,"Chalcone isomerase from soybean is inactivated by stoichiometric amounts of p-mercuribenzoate or HgCl2. Spectral titration of the enzyme with p-mercuribenzoate indicates that a single thiol group is modified. Treatment of modified enzyme with KCN or thiols results in a complete restoration of enzyme activity demonstrating that the inactivation is not due to irreversible protein denaturation. A product of the enzymatic reaction, naringenin, provides complete kinetic protection against inactivation by both mercurials. The binding constant (33 microM) for naringenin determined from the concentration dependence of the protection agrees with the inhibition constant (34 microM) for naringenin as a competitive inhibitor of the catalytic reaction. This agreement demonstrates that the observed kinetic protection results from the specific binding of naringenin to the active site. Incubation of native chalcone isomerase with sodium tetrathionate (0.1 M) results in a slow time-dependent loss of enzymatic activity. The inactivation of chalcone isomerase by tetrathionate and N-ethylmaleimide becomes very rapid in the presence of 6 M urea, indicating that the native tertiary structure is responsible for the low reactivity of the enzymatic thiol. The stoichiometric modification of reduced and denatured chalcone isomerase by [3H] N-ethylmaleimide indicates that the enzyme contains only a single cysteine residue and does not contain any disulfides. The evidence presented suggests that the only half-cystine residue in chalcone isomerase is located in the active site and thereby provides the first clue to the location of the active site in chalcone isomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1487232647,"Prior studies demonstrated that 1,2-diacylglycerols stimulated degradation of the choline-containing phospholipids, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin, in GH3 pituitary cells by a phospholipase A2 and a sphingomyelinase, respectively (Kolesnick, R. N. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 16759-16762). The present studies demonstrate that the phenothiazine trifluoperazine also stimulates degradation of these phospholipids. Trifluoperazine (25 microM) reduced phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin levels to 81 and 58% of control, respectively, after 30 min in cells labeled for 48 h with [3H] choline. Choline-containing metabolites were released specifically into the cytosolic fraction. The level of cytosolic phosphocholine, but not choline or CDP-choline, increased to 150% of control. These events were not mediated by inhibition of phosphatidylcholine synthesis. The level of 1,2-diacylglycerols, but not lysophosphatidylcholine or glycerol-3-phosphocholine, also increased. These data are most consistent with phosphatidylcholine degradation via a phospholipase C. Trifluoperazine-stimulated sphingomyelin degradation was accompanied by quantitative generation of ceramides consistent with activation of a sphingomyelinase. In contrast to trifluoperazine, choline-containing metabolites were released into the medium during stimulation by the 1,2-diacylglycerol 1,2-dioctanoyl-glycerol. Although both trifluoperazine and 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol increased ceramide levels, only 1,2-dioctanoylglycerol increased the sphingoid base level from 24 to 43 pmol/10(6) cells. Hence, trifluoperazine appears to deplete an intracellular pool of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin by a different mechanism than 1,2-diacylglycerols. This is the first report of phenothiazine-induced degradation of choline-containing phospholipids."

Three hexapeptides of the general sequence Val-Tyr-Pro-isoAsp-X-Ala, in which isoAsp represents an L-isoaspartyl residue and X represents Gly, Ser, or Ala, are methylated with the same order of preference following their microinjection into oocytes as in a purified system containing bovine brain protein carboxyl methyltransferase and S-adenosyl-L-[methyl-3H]methionine. The affinities of the enzyme for the glycyl, seryl, and alanyl variants of the peptides in vitro are 4.25, 3.04, and 1.67 microM, respectively. A nonapeptide of the sequence Lys-Ala-Ser-Ala-isoAsp-Leu-Ala-Lys-Tyr is a higher affinity substrate for the methyltransferase in vitro, characterized by a Km of 0.88 microM, but it is modified to a lesser extent in oocytes, partially because of its reduced stability in cytoplasm. The hexapeptide Val-Tyr-Pro-Asp-Gly-Ala, which contains an aspartyl residue in the usual stereoconfiguration, is not methylated either in vitro or in intact oocytes. Microinjection of any of the four isoaspartyl-containing peptides greatly stimulates total carboxyl methylation in oocytes, with rate increases ranging from 19- to 51-fold after the injection of 30 pmol of peptide. The protein ovalbumin is also modified following its microinjection into oocytes to near its calculated methyl-accepting capacity. Each of the isoaspartyl peptides can act as a competitive inhibitor of ovalbumin methylation both in vitro and in microinjected oocytes. The inhibitory potencies of the peptides parallel their specific methyl-accepting activities. The results demonstrate that the oocyte may be a useful model for studying the significance of protein carboxyl methylation because of the large functional excess of methylation capacity and the fidelity of the reactions compared to those observed in purified systems. This excess capability may have physiological significance when structurally abnormal proteins accumulate as a result of cellular stress and or aging."
https://openalex.org/W1536087025,Branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase is a heteroprotein complex of mitochondria and commits the branched chain alpha-ketoacids to their catabolic fate. Inherited nuclear mutations in humans decrease the activity of this complex and result in maple syrup urine disease. Here we demonstrate the restoration of branched chain alpha-ketoacid dehydrogenase activity to fibroblasts from a child with this disorder by transfection with a cDNA for the prebranched chain acyltransferase. Prior to transfection these fibroblasts contained the prebranched chain acyltransferase gene but failed to transcribe the gene and thus lacked the protein. Regulation of the restored complex by phosphorylation mechanisms resembles that of wild-type cells. These results describe a human cell modeling system for testing engineered proteins and support the possibility of gene replacement therapy for this human disorder.
