Whether such findings represent a causal contribution, or reflect opportunistic passengers of neurodegeneration, is also difficult to resolve. We constructed multiscale networks of the late-onset AD-associated virome, integrating genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and histopathological data across four brain regions from human post-mortem tissue. We observed increased human herpesvirus 6A (HHV-6A) and human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) from subjects with AD compared with controls. These results were replicated in two additional, independent and geographically dispersed cohorts. We observed regulatory relationships linking viral abundance and modulators of APP metabolism, including induction of APBB2, APPBP2, BIN1, BACE1, CLU, PICALM, and PSEN1 by HHV-6A. This study elucidates networks linking molecular, clinical, and neuropathological features with viral activity and is consistent with viral activity constituting a general feature of AD.

This study elucidates networks linking molecular, clinical, and neuropathological features with viral activity and is consistent with viral activity constituting a general feature of AD. Important roles for microbes and antimicrobial defenses in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been postulated or evaluated for at least six decades, beginning with Sjögren in 1952 (Sjogren et al., 1952Sjogren T. Sjogren H. Lindgren A.G. Morbus Alzheimer and morbus Pick; a genetic, clinical and patho-anatomical study.Acta Psychiatr. Neurol. Scand., Suppl. 1952; 82: 1-152PubMed Google Scholar). “Slow virus” was one of the early names used for the illness that eventually came to be known as prion disease, referring to the hypothesis that conventional viruses might be capable of acting to cause not only acute encephalitis, but also a progressive neuronal destruction process that might engender less inflammation because of its slowly progressive nature (Sigurðsson, 1954Sigurðsson B. Rida, a chronic encephalitis of sheep: with general remarks on infections which develop slowly and some of their special characteristics.Brit. Vet. J. 1954; 110: 341-344Crossref Google Scholar). Measles (MV) is a conventional virus that can act through acute inflammatory and slow neurodegenerative processes, occasionally re-emerging as a fatal brain disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) up to a decade after a typical acute MV infection (Murphy and Yunis, 1976Murphy J.V. Yunis E.J. Encephalopathy following measles infection in children with chronic illness.J. Pediatr. 1976; 88: 937-942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Beginning with Crapper McLachlan in 1980 (Middleton et al., 1980Middleton P.J. Petric M. Kozak M. Rewcastle N.B. McLachlan D.R. Herpes-simplex viral genome and senile and presenile dementias of Alzheimer and Pick.Lancet. 1980; 1: 1038Abstract PubMed Google Scholar), several investigators have proposed that AD is an SSPE-like illness, caused by a slow virus form of herpes simplex (Itzhaki, 2014Itzhaki R.F.

Hundreds of reports have associated AD with diverse bacterial and viral pathogens (Itzhaki et al., 2016Itzhaki R.F. Lathe R. Balin B.J. Ball M.J. Bearer E.L. Braak H. Bullido M.J. Carter C.

The results of these studies, taken in aggregate, are suggestive of a viral contribution to AD, though findings offer little insight into potential mechanisms, and a consistent association with specific viral species has not emerged. Recent reports demonstrate that diverse classes of microbes can stimulate amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation and deposition as part of an intra-CNS anti-microbial innate immune response whereby the amyloidosis triggered by various microbes results in the coating of the infectious particles by the growing amyloid aggregate (Soscia et al., 2010Soscia S.J.

These microbes coated with aggregated Aβ become unable to interact with cell surfaces, thereby arresting the infectious process. We designed this study to map and compare biological networks underlying two distinct AD-associated phenotypes using multiple independent datasets collected from human subjects. We began with a computational network characterization of a specific endophenotype of AD: brains meeting neuropathological criteria for AD from individuals who were cognitively intact at the time of death (Liang et al., 2010Liang W.S. Dunckley T. Beach T.G. Grover A. Mastroeni D. Ramsey K. Caselli R.J. Kukull W.A. McKeel D. Morris J.C. et al.Neuronal gene expression in non-demented individuals with intermediate Alzheimer’s Disease neuropathology.Neurobiol. Aging. 2010; 31: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), which we refer to here as “preclinical AD” (Sperling et al., 2011Sperling R.A. Aisen P.S. Beckett L.A. Bennett D.A. Craft S. Fagan A.M. Iwatsubo T. Jack Jr., C.R. Kaye J. Montine T.J. et al.Toward defining the preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease: recommendations from the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer’s Association workgroups on diagnostic guidelines for Alzheimer’s disease.Alzheimers Dement. 2011; 7: 280-292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). We presumed that a network model of preclinical AD (and its comparison with networks built from cognitively intact persons without neuropathology) might provide novel insights into the molecular context of neuropathology in the absence of clinical symptoms. Alternatively, since these individuals had eluded cognitive decline despite significant AD pathology, we reasoned that this might illuminate protective or resilience mechanisms. Functional genomic analysis of preclinical AD network alterations revealed multiple lines of evidence consistent with viral activity. We then directly evaluated viral activity in a multiscale network analysis of four large, multi-omic datasets (comprising samples from individuals with “clinical AD” as well as neuropathologically and cognitively normal controls) that included next generation sequencing data, enabling direct examination of viral DNA and RNA sequences. This study presents novel evidence linking the activity of specific viruses with AD. This has been enabled by comprehensive molecular profiling of large patient cohorts, facilitating the integration of diverse biomedical data types into an expansive view spanning multiple disease stages, brain regions, and -omic domains. This has also allowed us to direct our analysis in an entirely data-driven manner and benefit from a form of data capable of implicating specific viral species. Our results offer evidence of complex viral activity in the aging brain, including changes specific to AD, particularly implicating Herpesviridae, HHV-6, and HHV-7. Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence that specific viral species contribute to the development of neuropathology and AD. We constructed, mapped, and compared differences between distinct gene regulatory networks to investigate functional molecular changes underlying the etiology of AD (Figure 1). We used laser-captured neuronal gene expression data to construct probabilistic causal networks (PCN) representing preclinical AD and also healthy control (individuals without cognitive impairment or neuropathology) (Liang et al., 2007Liang W.S. Dunckley T. Beach T.G. Grover A. Mastroeni D. Walker D.G. Caselli R.J. Kukull W.A. McKeel D.

We focused on samples derived from brain regions associated with the most profound neuronal loss: the entorhinal cortex (Gómez-Isla et al., 1996Gómez-Isla T. Price J.L. McKeel Jr., D.W. Morris J.C. Growdon J.H. Hyman B.T. Profound loss of layer II entorhinal cortex neurons occurs in very mild Alzheimer’s disease.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4491-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (EC) and the hippocampus (Hyman et al., 1984Hyman B.T. Van Hoesen G.W. Damasio A.R. Barnes C.L. Alzheimer’s disease: cell-specific pathology isolates the hippocampal formation.Science. 1984; 225: 1168-1170Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (HIP). We built each PCN using a modified “inductive causation with latent variables” procedure (Pearl, 2009Pearl J. Causality. Cambridge University Press, 2009Crossref Google Scholar), constructing separate preclinical AD and control (CON) networks including paired samples from EC and HIP for each donor, and for each network, nominated genes that regulate the expression of unexpectedly large subnetworks as “network drivers” (see STAR Methods and Table S1). Edge reproducibility in PCNs has been demonstrated to be strongly dependent on sample size; however, detection of highly connected nodes is more robust across a range of sample sizes (Cohain et al., 2017Cohain A. Divaraniya A.A. Zhu K. Scarpa J.R. Kasarskis A. Zhu J. Chang R. Dudley J.T. Schadt E.E. Exploring the reproducibility of probabilistic causal molecular network models.Pac. Symp. Biocomput. 2017; 22: 120-131PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore focused initially on characterizing the set of drivers present only in the CON network (“Lost in preclinical AD”) and those present only in the preclinical AD network (“Gained in preclinical AD”) as a means to prioritize differences between preclinical AD and CON states. We found that promoters of both sets of drivers are strongly enriched (compared with the rest of the network) for a shared set of C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor (C2H2-TF) binding motifs (Figure 1E), especially SP1, MAZ, NRF1, and EGR1. This prompted us to evaluate other co-regulatory features associated with C2H2-TF activity that might explain a general shift in their collective activity. We found that G-quadruplex (G4) sequences are strongly enriched among the promoters of both sets of drivers in the network, but that the “Lost in preclinical AD” drivers have significantly more G4 motifs within their introns, exons, and 3′-UTR on both coding and non-coding strands (Figures 1F and 1G). We concordantly found a strong negative correlation between gene G4 density (G4 motif count, normalized by gene length), and gene expression in the EC in preclinical AD and clinical AD samples (Figure 1H). Given the complex roles for G4 in dynamically regulating mRNA transcription, stability, translation, and localization (Rhodes and Lipps, 2015Rhodes D. Lipps H.J. G-quadruplexes and their regulatory roles in biology.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: 8627-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that a global shift in G4 regulation or stability could explain the differences in C2H2-TF regulatory programs—for example, changes in expression and network influence of genes with especially high G4 density in locations like the 3′-UTR that are associated with alternative polyadenylation and miRNA-mediated regulation (Beaudoin and Perreault, 2013Beaudoin J.D. Perreault J.P. Exploring mRNA 3′-UTR G-quadruplexes: evidence of roles in both alternative polyadenylation and mRNA shortening.Nucleic Acids Res. 2013; 41: 5898-5911Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Identification of strong C2H2-TFs and G4 functional patterns in the differential network analysis suggested a potential role for virus-mediated network activities in AD (Figure 1D, see Table S1). Enrichments among the network drivers (gained and lost) in preclinical AD implicated viral infection susceptibility risk genes, as well as host differential gene expression changes associated with viral infection. We also noted findings around C2H2-TF and G4 sequences that are implicated in a range of proviral and antiviral contexts, including SP1: (1) binding with Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) protein Rta to regulate host and viral SP1 target genes (Chang et al., 2005Chang L.K. Chung J.Y. Hong Y.R. Ichimura T. Nakao M. Liu S.T. Activation of Sp1-mediated transcription by Rta of Epstein-Barr virus via an interaction with MCAF1.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 6528-6539Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); (2) regulating Human Immunodeficiency Virus 2 (HIV-2) LTR transcription (Harrich et al., 1989Harrich D. Garcia J. Wu F. Mitsuyasu R. Gonazalez J. Gaynor R. Role of SP1-binding domains in in vivo transcriptional regulation of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat.J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2585-2591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and (3) mediating antiviral effects against Human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Scholz et al., 2004Scholz M. Vogel J.U. Höver G. Prösch S. Kotchetkov R. Cinatl J. Koch F. Doerr H.W. Cinatl Jr., J. Thrombin induces Sp1-mediated antiviral effects in cytomegalovirus-infected human retinal pigment epithelial cells.Med. Microbiol. Immunol. (Berl.). 2004; 193: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In addition, G4 sequences are recognized as important regulatory features for viral pathogens such as EBV and HSV-1(Artusi et al., 2016Artusi S. Perrone R. Lago S. Raffa P. Di Iorio E. Palù G. Richter S.N. Visualization of DNA G-quadruplexes in herpes simplex virus 1-infected cells.Nucleic Acids Res. 2016; 44: 10343-10353PubMed Google Scholar), dynamically impacting translation of viral proteins (Murat et al., 2014Murat P. Zhong J. Lekieffre L. Cowieson N.P. Clancy J.L. Preiss T. Balasubramanian S. Khanna R. Tellam J. G-quadruplexes regulate Epstein-Barr virus-encoded nuclear antigen 1 mRNA translation.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2014; 10: 358-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Patterns of miRNA target enrichments identified by the differential network analysis of preclinical AD versus CON, as well as multiregional differential gene expression changes in clinical AD samples, offered an additional line of evidence for virally mediated network activity. We looked for significant overlap between experimentally validated gene targets of human miRNAs (Hsu et al., 2011Hsu S.D. Lin F.M. Wu W.Y. Liang C. Huang W.C. Chan W.L. Tsai W.T. Chen G.Z. Lee C.J. Chiu C.M. et al.miRTarBase: a database curates experimentally validated microRNA-target interactions.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39: D163-D169Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar) and multiregional differential gene expression signatures from preclinical AD samples (Liang et al., 2010Liang W.S. Dunckley T. Beach T.G. Grover A. Mastroeni D. Ramsey K. Caselli R.J. Kukull W.A. McKeel D. Morris J.C. et al.Neuronal gene expression in non-demented individuals with intermediate Alzheimer’s Disease neuropathology.Neurobiol. Aging. 2010; 31: 549-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), clinical AD samples (Liang et al., 2008Liang W.S. Dunckley T. Beach T.G. Grover A. Mastroeni D. Ramsey K. Caselli R.J. Kukull W.A.

Genomics. 2008; 33: 240-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), as well as “Lost in preclinical AD” and “Gained in preclinical AD” drivers. This identified a number of miRNA with gene networks overlapping many of these AD contexts, particularly miR-155, a multifunctional miR with associations to malignancy, innate immunity, and DNA virus activity. Interactions between miR-155 and viral biology are well established, including perturbation of miR-155 by EBV to stabilize viral latency (Gatto et al., 2008Gatto G. Rossi A. Rossi D. Kroening S. Bonatti S. Mallardo M.

HHV-6A in vitro infection of thyrocytes and T cells alters the expression of miRNA associated to autoimmune thyroiditis.Virol. J. 2017; 14: 3Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar) and coding of a miR-155 functional ortholog by Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) (Gottwein et al., 2007Gottwein E. Mukherjee N.

Virol. 2009; 83: 489-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Considering these findings, we sought to directly evaluate viral DNA and RNA sequences in the context of clinical AD. We performed this investigation using four large, independent multiomic datasets from individuals with clinical AD as well as neuropathologically and cognitively normal controls. To evaluate differential viral abundance in AD, we initially performed RNA-seq on samples from a cohort of AD and Control brains from the Mount Sinai Brain Bank (MSBB) and quantified differences in viral sequences between groups. We began by profiling MSBB sample transcriptomes across four brain regions, (superior temporal gyrus [STG], n = 137, anterior prefrontal cortex [APFC], n = 213, inferior frontal gyrus [IFG], n = 186, and parahippocampal gyrus [PHG], n = 107), which we used to quantify the presence and abundance of 515 viral species known or suspected to infect humans as a primary host (Brister et al., 2015Brister J.R. Ako-Adjei D. Bao Y. Blinkova O. NCBI viral genomes resource.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D571-D577Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We applied a viral mapping approach (Figure S1), based on a modified ViromeScan workflow (Rampelli et al., 2016Rampelli S. Soverini M. Turroni S. Quercia S. Biagi E. Brigidi P. Candela M. ViromeScan: a new tool for metagenomic viral community profiling.BMC Genomics. 2016; 17: 165Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), optimized for detection specificity, rather than sensitivity to allow us to discriminate between viruses with highly homologous regions, and to ensure we were not falsely including human-derived transcripts when summarizing viral abundance. We estimated viral abundance at two levels. We summarized RNA reads to the level of the entire viral sequence, with the aim of estimating “total viral transcription.” We then summarized the RNA reads to the level of individual genomic features based on counting reads that overlap any of the genomic features included in the NCBI annotations for that viral sequence (Brister et al., 2015Brister J.R. Ako-Adjei D. Bao Y. Blinkova O. NCBI viral genomes resource.Nucleic Acids Res. 2015; 43: D571-D577Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Throughout this study, we have evaluated viral abundance according to these two levels separately. We identified differential abundance of multiple viral species in the APFC and STG (Figure 2A, Table S2). The most consistent difference we saw was an AD-associated increase in the abundance of two closely related Roseoloviruses, HHV-6A and HHV-7, across the APFC and STG. The third Roseolovirus, HHV-6B had a discordant profile with increased abundance in AD in the STG, and reduced in the APFC. Viral gene-level differential expression (Figure 2B, Table S2) identified increased abundance across the APFC and STG regions of the HHV-6A U3/U4 genes (positional homologs of human cytomegalovirus [HCMV] US22, with transactivating effects on other viral species [Mori et al., 1998Mori Y. Yagi H. Shimamoto T. Isegawa Y. Sunagawa T. Inagi R. Kondo K. Tano Y. Yamanishi K. Analysis of human herpesvirus 6 U3 gene, which is a positional homolog of human cytomegalovirus UL 24 gene.Virology. 1998; 249: 129-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar]) and the HHV-7 direct repeat terminal gene, DR1. To understand whether our observations of altered viral abundance in AD would also be preserved in additional cohorts, we incorporated post-mortem brain RNA-seq data from three additional, independent consortium studies: (1) Religious Orders Study47 (ROS), a longitudinal clinico-pathological study comprising 300 samples from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of individuals with AD and healthy controls, (2) Memory and Aging Project (Bennett et al., 2012aBennett D.A.

Alzheimer Res. 2012; 9: 646-663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (MAP) comprising 298 samples from the DLPFC of individuals with AD, as well as healthy controls, and (3) Mayo Temporal Cortex (Allen et al., 2016Allen M. Carrasquillo M.M. Funk C. Heavner B.D. Zou F. Younkin C.S. Burgess J.D. Chai H.S. Crook J. Eddy J.A. et al.Human whole genome genotype and transcriptome data for Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.Sci. Data. 2016; 3: 160089Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) (MAYO TCX) comprising 278 samples from the temporal cortex of individuals with AD, pathological aging (PA) (Dickson et al., 1992Dickson D.W. Crystal H.A. Mattiace L.A. Masur D.M. Blau A.D. Davies P. Yen S.H. Aronson M.K. Identification of normal and pathological aging in prospectively studied nondemented elderly humans.Neurobiol. Aging. 1992; 13: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and healthy controls. Our goal was to process these additional samples using the procedure described above and integrate the results (Table S2) into a meta-analysis of viral abundance in AD (Figures 2E and 2F). Our main finding was a consistently increased abundance of HHV-6A and HHV-7, driven mainly by the “unique” region of each virus (the full viral sequence excluding the ∼15 kb flanking DRL and DRR terminal repeats). We also observed an increased abundance of the HSV-1 latency-associated transcript (LAT), supporting an increased rate of HSV-1 infection (latent or otherwise) in AD. These additional validations support the main findings originally observed in the MSBB cohort, that multiple viruses are at increased abundance in AD, across multiple brain tissues, with prominent roles for Roseoloviruses HHV-6A and HHV-7. We utilized the PA and PSP samples available within the MAYO TCX cohort to perform comparisons against these additional neurodegenerative disorders, to understand whether our findings were specific to AD or perhaps reflect a more general feature of neurodegenerative processes. In a comparison of AD versus PA, we found an increased abundance of HHV-6A and HHV-7 (Figure S2). When we compared AD versus PSP, we found increased HHV-7 in AD, but reduced HHV-6A. Taken together, these observations suggest that elevated HHV6-A and HHV-7 are not ubiquitous features of neurodegenerative disease, although HHV-6A may also be relevant to other diseases such as PSP. We looked for evidence of viral DNA in whole-exome sequencing (WES) data that was generated on STG samples (n = 286) in the MSBB cohort, applying a similar procedure to that used in evaluating viral RNA abundance (Figure S1). We detected viral DNA for multiple viruses, and identified an increased abundance of HHV-6A (Figures 2C and 2D, Table S2). This was primarily due to reads mapping to HHV-6A Region 8009-151234, which comprises the “unique” region of HHV-6A (and is consistent with our findings in the RNA sequences). Chromosomal integration of HHV-6A into host subtelomeric regions is well described (Arbuckle et al., 2010Arbuckle J.H. Medveczky M.M. Luka J. Hadley S.H. Luegmayr A. Ablashi D. Lund T.C. Tolar J. De Meirleir K. Montoya J.G. et al.The latent human herpesvirus-6A genome specifically integrates in telomeres of human chromosomes in vivo and in vitro.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2010; 107: 5563-5568Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), occurring via a mechanism involving homologous recombination between telomeric repeats and the DRR. Excision and reactivation of integrated HHV-6A is associated with preferential loss of the entire DRL, facilitating viral circularization and rolling circle replication (Prusty et al., 2013Prusty B.K. Krohne G. Rudel T. Reactivation of chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus-6 by telomeric circle formation.PLoS Genet. 2013; 9: e1004033Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This may indicate that the HHV-6A DNA that we find as more abundant in AD reflects HHV-6A that has undergone reactivation from a chromosomally integrated form, although we have not evaluated this directly.

https://openalex.org/W2809237949,"Summary Chromatin regulators play a broad role in regulating gene expression and, when gone awry, can lead to cancer. Here, we demonstrate that ablation of the histone demethylase LSD1 in cancer cells increases repetitive element expression, including endogenous retroviral elements (ERVs), and decreases expression of RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) components. Significantly, this leads to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) stress and activation of type 1 interferon, which stimulates anti-tumor T cell immunity and restrains tumor growth. Furthermore, LSD1 depletion enhances tumor immunogenicity and T cell infiltration in poorly immunogenic tumors and elicits significant responses of checkpoint blockade-refractory mouse melanoma to anti-PD-1 therapy. Consistently, TCGA data analysis shows an inverse correlation between LSD1 expression and CD8+ T cell infiltration in various human cancers. Our study identifies LSD1 as a potent inhibitor of anti-tumor immunity and responsiveness to immunotherapy and suggests LSD1 inhibition combined with PD-(L)1 blockade as a novel cancer treatment strategy."
https://openalex.org/W2809594440,"Transposable elements represent nearly half of mammalian genomes and are generally described as parasites, or “junk DNA.” The LINE1 retrotransposon is the most abundant class and is thought to be deleterious for cells, yet it is paradoxically highly expressed during early development. Here, we report that LINE1 plays essential roles in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and pre-implantation embryos. In ESCs, LINE1 acts as a nuclear RNA scaffold that recruits Nucleolin and Kap1/Trim28 to repress Dux, the master activator of a transcriptional program specific to the 2-cell embryo. In parallel, LINE1 RNA mediates binding of Nucleolin and Kap1 to rDNA, promoting rRNA synthesis and ESC self-renewal. In embryos, LINE1 RNA is required for Dux silencing, synthesis of rRNA, and exit from the 2-cell stage. The results reveal an essential partnership between LINE1 RNA, Nucleolin, Kap1, and peri-nucleolar chromatin in the regulation of transcription, developmental potency, and ESC self-renewal."

Our findings suggest a link between INM metabolism and genome regulation and have potential relevance for human lipodystrophy. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) synthesizes phospholipids for membrane growth and cell proliferation, and triacylglycerol (TAG) to store energy (van Meer et al., 2008van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W. Membrane lipids: Where they are and how they behave.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (4481) Google Scholar). TAG and phospholipids have common precursors, and the flow of lipids into storage or growth is a key cellular decision that is balanced with nutrient availability (Figure 1A). Phosphatidic acid (PA) is a lipid precursor at the branch point of the lipid storage and growth pathways (Figure 1A) (Carman and Han, 2011Carman G.M. Han G.S. Regulation of phospholipid synthesis in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 859-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). PA is either converted into cytidyldiphosphate diacylglycerol (CDP-DAG) by yeast Cds1 (human CDS1) to promote new phospholipid synthesis or is dephosphorylated by Pah1 (human Lipin) to produce diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG, a signaling lipid, is phosphorylated by the Dgk1 kinase to regenerate PA, or is metabolized further into TAG. TAGs and steryl esters are stored in lipid droplets, which are synthesized on the ER and outer nuclear membrane (ONM) (Hashemi and Goodman, 2015Hashemi H.F. Goodman J.M.

Although lipid droplets have sporadically been observed inside the nucleus of some mammalian cells (Layerenza et al., 2013Layerenza J.P. González P. García de Bravo M.M. Polo M.P. Sisti M.S.

Nuclear lipid droplets identified by electron microscopy of serial sections.BMC Res. Notes. 2013; 6: 386Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), lipid droplet synthesis is considered to be the task of the ER/ONM (Figure 1B). The lipid composition of cellular organelles is customized to their functions, and the lipid composition of membranes can vary, including lipid asymmetry across the bilayer as well as in the lateral dimension (van Meer et al., 2008van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W. Membrane lipids: Where they are and how they behave.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (4481) Google Scholar). The ER, the cell’s main lipid factory, is contiguous with the ONM, which is joined with the inner nuclear membrane (INM) at membrane openings occupied by nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) (Ungricht and Kutay, 2017Ungricht R. Kutay U. Mechanisms and functions of nuclear envelope remodelling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 229-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Given that lipids can laterally diffuse within membranes (Figure 1B), it is generally assumed that the INM passively receives lipids from the ONM/ER and is itself metabolically silent (van Meer et al., 2008van Meer G. Voelker D.R. Feigenson G.W. Membrane lipids: Where they are and how they behave.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 112-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (4481) Google Scholar). The INM is enriched in proteins that are required for genome regulation, inheritance, and protection, including integral and peripheral membrane proteins (Ungricht and Kutay, 2017Ungricht R. Kutay U. Mechanisms and functions of nuclear envelope remodelling.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2017; 18: 229-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that specific lipids interact with the transmembrane domain of particular proteins (Gao et al., 2016Gao Y. Cao E. Julius D. Cheng Y. TRPV1 structures in nanodiscs reveal mechanisms of ligand and lipid action.Nature. 2016; 534: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Hence, the specific INM proteome might reflect a functionally tailored lipid environment. It is therefore important to know what the INM lipids are and where they come from. We have developed tools to directly examine the INM lipid composition in living cells and combine a lipid biosensor strategy with specific perturbations of lipid metabolism. Our study argues that the INM is a metabolically active territory, whose chemical reactions could influence numerous aspects of genome function. The INM and ONM are only 10–50 nm apart and biochemical fractionation fails to separate them into pure fractions that would be suitable for lipidomics (Monneron et al., 1972Monneron A. Blobel G. Palade G.E. Fractionation of the nucleus by divalent cations. Isolation of nuclear membranes.J. Cell Biol. 1972; 55: 104-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In order to explore the lipid composition of the INM, we designed a set of genetically encoded, fluorescently labeled biosensors that visualize PA and DAG in living yeast cells. By appending or omitting a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to the sensors, we can assess PA and DAG levels in the nuclear as well as the cytoplasmic membrane compartment. The Q2 domain of the S. cerevisiae transcription factor Opi1 specifically recognizes high PA levels at the plasma membrane with a consistent pattern across a cell population (Figure 1C) confirming earlier reports (Loewen et al., 2004Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Phospholipid metabolism regulated by a transcription factor sensing phosphatidic acid.Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). When increasing the sensor concentration about 10-fold, the fluorescence intensity at the plasma membrane increases correspondingly, but no other membrane compartments become stained (Figures S1A and S1B). In contrast to this cytoplasmic sensor, an NLS version of the PA sensor showed a diffuse intranuclear signal (Figure 1C; see Figures S1C for sensor specificity, S1D for expression levels, and S1E and S1F for the import mechanism). Consistent results were obtained by using the PA-sensing domain of the S. cerevisiae Spo20 protein (Figures S2A and S2B) (Nakanishi et al., 2004Nakanishi H. de los Santos P. Neiman A.M. Positive and negative regulation of a SNARE protein by control of intracellular localization.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1802-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). These data suggest that PA is present at lower levels at the INM and ONM/ER compared to the PA-rich plasma membrane under the conditions tested. To detect the downstream lipid DAG, we used the DAG-specific recognition domains of R. norvegicus protein kinase C (PKCβ C1a+C1b) (Lučić et al., 2016Lučić I. Truebestein L. Leonard T.A. Novel Features of DAG-Activated PKC Isozymes Reveal a Conserved 3-D Architecture.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 121-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We detected DAG predominantly at the vacuolar membrane, but not at the ONM and ER (Figure 1D; see also Figures S2C for sensor specificity and S1D for expression levels). This specific distribution was retained when we overexpressed the sensor (Figures S2D and S2E). Both 10-fold and approximately 40-fold overexpression strongly increased the signal at the vacuole, yet little DAG signal was observed at the ONM/ER or the plasma membrane. This suggests a major difference in DAG levels between the vacuolar membrane and the ONM/ER/plasma membrane. To test whether the sensor can in principle detect DAG in membrane compartments other than the vacuole, we conditionally targeted Pah1 to the PA-rich plasma membrane in order to ectopically convert PA into DAG. Upon tethering a constitutively active variant of Pah1 (Pah1 7A) to the plasma membrane protein Pma1, the DAG sensor stained the plasma membrane in addition to the vacuole, with about equal intensity (Figure S2F). This indicates that the DAG sensor is able to detect newly synthesized DAG at an ectopic location, and that enrichment of the sensor on the vacuole does not prevent it from recognizing other DAG-containing membranes.Figure S2Characterization of Lipid Sensor Specificity, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Live imaging of cells expressing the plasmid-based PA sensor Spo20-mCherry with or without the Nup60 NLS.

Targeting wild-type Pah1 to the PM resulted in a modest increase of DAG in this location, possibly because of an inefficient activation by the ER-resident Nem1-Spo7 phosphatase complex, which activates Pah1 through dephosphorylation (Santos-Rosa et al., 2005Santos-Rosa H.

Given the lack of DAG detection at the ONM/ER, it was striking to see that the NLS-bearing version of the DAG sensor targeted the INM (Figure 1D). The NLS-DAG sensor is expressed at similar levels as the non-NLS version and the sensor fluorescent intensities at the INM and vacuolar membrane are in a similar range (Figures 1D and S1D). This suggests that the difference in DAG detection between ONM/ER and INM is not a result of different sensor concentrations. Moreover, a version of the NLS-DAG sensor (Q63/Q128 > E) that is deficient in DAG binding distributes throughout the nucleoplasm (Figure S2C). Hence, the nuclear rim localization of the sensor is most likely a consequence of DAG recognition at the INM rather than exclusion by chromatin or unspecific interactions with INM proteins. Finally, DAG recognition per se does not appear to be influenced by appending an NLS to the sensor, since the NLS-DAG sensor was bound to the vacuole when its nuclear import was blocked (Figure S1F). In summary, our findings indicate a potential enrichment of DAG at the INM. To validate the INM localization of the DAG sensor, we performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) with lipid sensors fused to the C-terminal half of the Venus fluorophore (VC) and two nuclear proteins, Pus1 and Nup60, fused to the N-terminal half of the fluorophore (VN) (Figure 1E). Pus1 is a pseudouridine synthase in the nucleoplasm; Nup60 is a basket nucleoporin, exclusively localized on the nuclear face of the NPC. The NLS version of the DAG sensor interacted with the nucleoplasmic Pus1-VN specifically at the nuclear rim consistent with the presence of DAG at the INM (Figure 1F). Also, Nup60 interacted with the NLS-DAG sensor confirming its INM localization. In contrast, the DAG sensor without NLS failed to interact with Pus1-VN and Nup60-VN. The NLS-PA sensor showed fluorescent complementation with Pus1-VN in the nucleoplasm and Nup60-VN at the nuclear rim consistent with its nucleoplasmic localization in wild-type cells (Figure 1F). A faint BiFC signal of the PA sensor without exogenous NLS in Nup60-VN-expressing cells likely stems from an intrinsic NLS that is present in the Q2 domain of the PA sensor and leads to weak nuclear import (Loewen et al., 2004Loewen C.J. Gaspar M.L. Jesch S.A. Delon C. Ktistakis N.T. Henry S.A. Levine T.P. Phospholipid metabolism regulated by a transcription factor sensing phosphatidic acid.Science. 2004; 304: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The PA and DAG sensors did not interfere with cell growth under the conditions tested, making it unlikely that they cause major alterations of lipid metabolism (Figure S1G). If DAG is indeed enriched at the INM, we should be able to convert this pool into PA by experimentally increasing Dgk1 activity at the INM (Figure S3A). Dgk1 is an ER-resident transmembrane protein and is expected to follow a different nuclear import route than soluble cargo. We therefore appended the NLS of the INM-resident transmembrane protein Heh2 (Meinema et al., 2011Meinema A.C. Laba J.K. Hapsari R.A. Otten R. Mulder F.A. Kralt A. van den Bogaart G. Lusk C.P. Poolman B. Veenhoff L.M. Long unfolded linkers facilitate membrane protein import through the nuclear pore complex.Science. 2011; 333: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) to Dgk1 and analyzed its localization. Overexpressed wild-type Dgk1 was detected both at the peripheral ER and at the nuclear envelope (NE) and induced NE proliferations consistent with previous reports (Figures S3B and S3C) (Han et al., 2008aHan G.S. O’Hara L. Carman G.M. Siniossoglou S. An unconventional diacylglycerol kinase that regulates phospholipid synthesis and nuclear membrane growth.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 20433-20442Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In contrast, the NLS version of Dgk1 removed the enzyme from the peripheral ER while targeting the NE, suggesting its nuclear import (Figure S3B). Indeed, immunogold electron microscopy (EM) demonstrated that wild-type Dgk1 is present on both sides of the NE (i.e., INM and ONM), whereas NLS-Dgk1 is enriched mainly at the inner side of the NE (Figure S3D). Importantly, NLS-Dgk1 caused a release of the NLS-DAG sensor from the INM into the nucleoplasm with concomitant binding of the NLS-PA sensor to the INM, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant of NLS-Dgk1 failed to release the NLS-DAG sensor from the INM (Figure S3E). These results suggest that our lipid sensors can specifically detect a Dgk1-mediated interconversion of DAG into PA at the INM. Taken together, our data demonstrate that a DAG lipid sensor recognizes the INM differently from the ONM/ER, likely as the result of a different lipid composition (Figure 1G). This raises the important question whether the INM exhibits a unique lipid metabolic activity, which could be functionally important in cell physiology. To explore whether the INM is metabolically active, we measured its lipid composition upon reprogramming lipid metabolism toward lipid storage (Figure 2A). Cds1 inhibition is expected to channel PA into the Pah1-dependent branch of TAG synthesis and storage. To create this condition, we employed a temperature-sensitive mutant of Cds1 (cds1-ts; Figure S4A) and measured PA levels at the INM with the NLS-bearing PA sensor at the permissive (23°C) and restrictive (37°C) temperatures. Lipid storage was monitored by staining lipid droplet (LD) neutral lipids with the BODIPY 493/503 dye. When cds1-ts cells were grown at the permissive temperature (23°C), they showed low PA levels at the INM and small cytoplasmic lipid droplets (cLDs), similar to wild-type cells grown at 23°C or 37°C (Figure 2B). In contrast, cds1-ts cells at the restrictive temperature (37°C) showed large cLDs, consistent with a role of yeast and human Cds1 in influencing lipid droplet size (Fei et al., 2011Fei W. Shui G.

Strikingly, we detected some large BODIPY-positive structures, typically one or two per cell, that enriched the NLS-bearing PA sensor on their surface. Moreover, these structures localized to the nuclear interior as judged by the NPC marker Nup188-GFP (Figure 2B; see Figure S4B for specificity control). These features suggest that the observed structures are intranuclear and represent nuclear lipid droplets (nLDs) with a core of BODIPY-stainable neutral lipids and a PA-rich lipid layer on the surface. To understand how nLDs form, we followed their emergence after Cds1 inhibition (Figure 2C and Videos S1 and S2). PA levels at the INM began to rise after 2 hr at the restrictive temperature, PA started to accumulate at small BODIPY-positive foci at the INM after 3 hr, and prominent nLDs had formed after 4 hr, which absorbed almost the entire pool of nuclear PA on their surface. Quantification of nLD biogenesis in multiple cells confirms the redistribution of the NLS-PA sensor from the nucleoplasm to the INM and, finally, onto the nLD surface. nLDs were found in approximately one-third of cds1-ts cells at 37°C (Figure 2D) and exhibited a similar diameter as cLDs (Figure 2E). To study nLD ultrastructure, we employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM). After 4 hr of Cds1 inactivation at 37°C, we observed prominent nLDs, often close to the INM (Figure 2F), which likely correspond to the BODIPY-positive and NLS-PA-sensor-enriched structures seen by live-cell fluorescence microscopy. To exclude the possibility that nLD production merely reflects a mutant condition, we supplemented exponentially growing wild-type cells with 0.5"

In areas V4 and IT of macaques, we found that firing rates and stimulus representations were enhanced by attention but only following a MS toward the attended stimulus. The onset of neural attentional modulations was tightly coupled to the MS onset. The results reveal a major link between the effects of covert attention on cortical visual processing and the overt movement of the eyes."
https://openalex.org/W2809448717,"Focal malformations of cortical development (FMCDs), including focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) and hemimegalencephaly (HME), are major etiologies of pediatric intractable epilepsies exhibiting cortical dyslamination. Brain somatic mutations in MTOR have recently been identified as a major genetic cause of FMCDs. However, the molecular mechanism by which these mutations lead to cortical dyslamination remains poorly understood. Here, using patient tissue, genome-edited cells, and mouse models with brain somatic mutations in MTOR, we discovered that disruption of neuronal ciliogenesis by the mutations underlies cortical dyslamination in FMCDs. We found that abnormal accumulation of OFD1 at centriolar satellites due to perturbed autophagy was responsible for the defective neuronal ciliogenesis. Additionally, we found that disrupted neuronal ciliogenesis accounted for cortical dyslamination in FMCDs by compromising Wnt signals essential for neuronal polarization. Altogether, this study describes a molecular mechanism by which brain somatic mutations in MTOR contribute to the pathogenesis of cortical dyslamination in FMCDs."

To track research output, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of TB research from the past decade. Methods The Web of Science database was searched for publications from January 2007 to December 2016 with “tuberculosis” in the title. References were analysed using the R bibliometrix package. A year-stratified 5% random subset was drawn to extract funding sources and identify research areas. Findings The annual growth rate of publications was 7.3%, and was highest (13.1%) among Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). The USA was the most productive country, with 18.4% of references, followed by India (9.7%), China (7.3%), England (6.5%), and South Africa (3.9%). In the subset analysis, the most common research area was ‘fundamental research’ (33.8%). Frequently acknowledged funders were US and EU-based, with China and India emerging as top funders. Collaborations appeared more frequently between high-income countries and low/medium income countries (LMICs), with fewer collaborations among LMICs. Conclusion The past decade has seen a continued increase in TB publications. While USA continues to dominate research output and funding, BRICS countries have emerged as major research producers and funders. Collaborations among BRICS would enhance future TB research productivity."
https://openalex.org/W2809379800,"Many brain regions contain local interneurons of distinct types. How does an interneuron type contribute to the input-output transformations of a given brain region? We addressed this question in the mouse retina by chemogenetically perturbing horizontal cells, an interneuron type providing feedback at the first visual synapse, while monitoring the light-driven spiking activity in thousands of ganglion cells, the retinal output neurons. We uncovered six reversible perturbation-induced effects in the response dynamics and response range of ganglion cells. The effects were enhancing or suppressive, occurred in different response epochs, and depended on the ganglion cell type. A computational model of the retinal circuitry reproduced all perturbation-induced effects and led us to assign specific functions to horizontal cells with respect to different ganglion cell types. Our combined experimental and theoretical work reveals how a single interneuron type can differentially shape the dynamical properties of distinct output channels of a brain region."
https://openalex.org/W2810018031,"The strength model of self-control is one of the most influential and well-established models of self-regulation in social psychology. However, recent attempts to replicate the ego depletion effect have sometimes failed. The goal of this study is to investigate self-reported replication rates and the frequency of a set of questionable research practices (QRP) in ego depletion research. A literature search resulted in 1721 researchers who had previously published on ego depletion. They were invited to participate in an anonymous online survey. The respondents (n = 277), on average, had published over three papers on ego depletion, and had completed more than two additional, unpublished studies. Respondents indicated that in more than 40% of their studies, results were similar in magnitude to those reported in the existing literature, and more than 60% reported conducting a priori power analyses. 39.2% of respondents were aware of other researchers who engaged in the surveyed QRP's, while 37.7% affirmed to have employed said QRP's. These results underline the importance of reducing QRP's to reliably test the validity of the ego depletion effect."
https://openalex.org/W2810374485,"Many current faculty believe that teaching effort and research success are inversely correlated. This trade-off has rarely been empirically tested; yet, it still impedes efforts to increase the use of evidence-based teaching (EBT), and implement effective teaching training programs for graduate students, our future faculty. We tested this tradeoff for graduate students using a national sample of life science PhD students. We characterize how increased training in EBT impacts PhD students' confidence in their preparation for a research career, in communicating their research, and their publication number. PhD students who invested time into EBT did not suffer in confidence in research preparedness, scientific research communication, or in publication number. Instead, overall, the data trend towards a slight synergy between investing in EBT and research preparation. Thus, the tension between developing research and teaching skills may not be salient for today's graduate students. This work is proof of concept that institutions can incorporate training in EBT into graduate programs without reducing students' preparedness for a research career. Although some institutions already have graduate teaching programs, increasing these programs at scale, and including training in EBT methods could create a new avenue for accelerating the spread of evidence-based teaching and improved teaching across higher education."
https://openalex.org/W2811098460,"Exiguobacterium antarcticum strain B7 is a psychrophilic Gram-positive bacterium that possesses enzymes that can be used for several biotechnological applications. However, many proteins from its genome are considered hypothetical proteins (HPs). These functionally unknown proteins may indicate important functions regarding the biological role of this bacterium, and the use of bioinformatics tools can assist in the biological understanding of this organism through functional annotation analysis. Thus, our study aimed to assign functions to proteins previously described as HPs, present in the genome of E. antarcticum B7. We used an extensive in silico workflow combining several bioinformatics tools for function annotation, sub-cellular localization and physicochemical characterization, three-dimensional structure determination, and protein-protein interactions. This genome contains 2772 genes, of which 765 CDS were annotated as HPs. The amino acid sequences of all HPs were submitted to our workflow and we successfully attributed function to 132 HPs. We identified 11 proteins that play important roles in the mechanisms of adaptation to adverse environments, such as flagellar biosynthesis, biofilm formation, carotenoids biosynthesis, and others. In addition, three predicted HPs are possibly related to arsenic tolerance. Through an in vitro assay, we verified that E. antarcticum B7 can grow at high concentrations of this metal. The approach used was important to precisely assign function to proteins from diverse classes and to infer relationships with proteins with functions already described in the literature. This approach aims to produce a better understanding of the mechanism by which this bacterium adapts to extreme environments and to the finding of targets with biotechnological interest."

Gene expression studies are valuable in overcoming such challenges since they can shed light on differentially regulated pathways and may ultimately identify valuable biomarkers. This two-stage transcriptome-wide study, including 397 ALS patients and 645 control subjects, identified 2,943 differentially expressed transcripts predominantly involved in RNA binding and intracellular transport. When batch effects between the two stages were overcome, three different models (support vector machines, nearest shrunken centroids, and LASSO) discriminated ALS patients from control subjects in the validation stage with high accuracy. The models’ accuracy reduced considerably when discriminating ALS from diseases that mimic ALS clinically (N = 75), nor could it predict survival. We here show that whole blood transcriptome profiles are able to reveal biological processes involved in ALS. Also, this study shows that using these profiles to differentiate between ALS and mimic syndromes will be challenging, even when taking batch effects in transcriptome data into account."

Methods Secondary data from the 2013 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) was used. Households whose head of household and spouse (for married households) were 18 to 64 years old were included. Results Households with 1 to 3 chronic conditions had higher odds of having any OOPC compared to households with no chronic conditions (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.39, 2.17) (p < .01). Households with 1 to 3 and 4 or more chronic health conditions were associated with higher odds of having any medical debt (AOR 2.24, 95% CI 1.75 to 2.87; AOR 5.04, 95% CI 3.04 to 8.34) compared to those with no chronic conditions (p < 0.01). Similarly, 1 to 3 and 4 or more chronic health conditions was associated with higher amounts of OOPC (Exponentiated Coefficient 1.18, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.36; Exponentiated Coefficient 1.56, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.07) and medical debt (Exponentiated Coefficient 1.69, 95% CI 1.23 to 2.34; Exponentiated Coefficient 2.73, 95% CI 1.19 to 6.25) compared to households with no chronic conditions (p < 0.05).

https://openalex.org/W2811434135,"Methamphetamine (Meth) is a widely abused psychoactive drug that primarily damages the nervous system, notably causing dopaminergic neuronal apoptosis. CCAAT-enhancer binding protein (C/EBPβ) is a transcription factor and an important regulator of cell apoptosis and autophagy. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP5) is a proapoptotic factor that mediates Meth-induced neuronal apoptosis, and Trib3 (tribbles pseudokinase 3) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-inducible gene involved in autophagic cell death through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. To test the hypothesis that C/EBPβ is involved in Meth-induced IGFBP5-mediated neuronal apoptosis and Trib3-mediated neuronal autophagy, we measured the protein expression of C/EBPβ after Meth exposure and evaluated the effects of silencing C/EBPβ, IGFBP5, or Trib3 on Meth-induced apoptosis and autophagy in neuronal cells and in the rat striatum after intrastriatal Meth injection. We found that, at relatively high doses, Meth exposure increased C/EBPβ protein expression, which was accompanied by increased neuronal apoptosis and autophagy; triggered the IGFBP5-mediated, p53-up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA)-related mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway; and stimulated the Trib3-mediated ER stress signaling pathway through the Akt-mTOR signaling axis. We also found that autophagy is an early response to Meth-induced stress upstream of apoptosis and plays a detrimental role in Meth-induced neuronal cell death. These results suggest that Meth exposure induces C/EBPβ expression, which plays an essential role in the neuronal apoptosis and autophagy induced by relatively high doses of Meth; however, relatively low concentrations of Meth did not change the expression of C/EBPβ in vitro. Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of C/EBPβ in low-dose Meth-induced neurotoxicity.-Xu, X., Huang, E., Luo, B., Cai, D., Zhao, X., Luo, Q., Jin, Y., Chen, L., Wang, Q., Liu, C., Lin, Z., Xie, W.-B., Wang, H.

Ninety three days old plants during grain filling stage were subjected to heat stress at an elevated temperature of 37°C and 42°C for different time intervals (30 min, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h). Two subtractive cDNA libraries were prepared with RNA isolated from leaf samples at 37°C and 42°C heat stress. The ESTs obtained were reconfirmed by reverse northern dot blot hybridization. A total of 175 contigs and 403 singlets were obtained from 1728 ESTs by gene ontology analysis. Differential expression under heat stress was validated for a few selected genes (10) by qRT-PCR. A transcript showing homology to Hsp90 was observed to be upregulated (7.6 fold) under heat stress in cv. C306. CDS of TaHsp90 (Accession no. MF383197) was isolated from cv. C306 and characterized. Heterologous expression of TaHsp90 was validated in E. coli BL21 and confirmed by protein gel blot and MALDI-TOF analysis. Computational based analysis was carried out to understand the molecular functioning of TaHsp90. The heat stress responsive SSH library developed led to identification of a number of heat responsive genes/ESTs, which can be utilized for unravelling the heat tolerance mechanism in wheat.

Here, we tested two CRISPR-edited DMD monkeys (both were 4 years old) that were identified as mutant. The MT-1 is a biallelic knockout homozygous with a 1-bp deletion, and 100% of tested blood, muscle, and skin cells are mutant. The MT-2 is a mosaic mutant monkey with 2-bp deletions, containing about 50% mutant cells (Fig. 1A). OTs were analyzed in both mutant monkeys and one age-matched WT sibling control (WT-1). A total of 17 presumptive OT sites were predicted with CCTop (CRISPR/Cas9 target online predictor) software according to PAM loci and similarity of sgRNA and were identified through Sanger sequences with specific primers. Consequently, there was no OT occurring at these predicted sites (Fig. 1 (B–E) and Table S1). To further validate on- and off-targets at WGS level, the single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions or deletions (indels) were examined at a depth of 60× to cover variants of lower frequencies, including coding region, RNA splicing, up- and downstream, intron, intergenic region, and 5′-UTR. There are 7,546,817 SNVs and 1,324,952 indels in MT-1 (Fig. 2A) and 8,935,763 SNVs and 1,445,207 indels in MT-2 (Fig. 2B), respectively. Detailed comparisons of indels and SNVs of MT-1 versus WT-1 and MT-2 versus WT-1 are shown in Tables S2–S5. Compared with the reference genome, a total of 847 homologous sequences of sgRNA were screened out with the NCBI alignment tool blastn (Table S6). There were 510 general sites in MT-1, including 442 SNVs and 68 indels, and 592 general sites in MT-2, containing 535 SNVs and 57 indels. We used the WGS sequence of the WT sibling first and then an online genomic database as reference to filter the SNVs and indels step by step. According to the identity of genomes between reference and sibling, SNVs were filtered, and there remained 208 SNVs in MT-1 and 227 SNVs in MT-2 in intronic or intergenic regions, but not in the coding region, splicing, and up- and downstream in both mutant monkeys (Table 1). In contrast with inbred mice, humans and monkeys have rich genome diversity and complex individual differences. We mainly focused on the identification of indels that contain almost all of the mutations introduced by nonhomologous end joining, because they are the hallmarks of endonuclease-induced damage (9Zhao H.

Similarly, given the identity with reference and WT control, we filtered and excluded repetitive sequence and genomic WGS sequence assemblies (NW_xxx). The remaining three indels in MT-1 and two in MT-2 were validated using Sanger sequence, and we found that there were one intronic indel in MT-1 and two intergenic indels in MT-1 and MT-2, respectively. To investigate the potential interaction with dystrophin gene for these five indels, we searched them in the genome bank of Macaca mulatta from NCBI. The four intergenic sequences and the intronic one could not be found in known coding genes. There is a single exonic indel located at the expected locus, the same as with Sanger sequencing (Table 1). Together, these results indicated that all on-target but no off-target mutations exist in functional genome regions of DMD monkeys.Table 1Summary of on- and off-target sites detected by whole-genome sequencingTarget typesCRISPR-editing MT-1CRISPR-editing MT-2PredictedFilteredPredictedFilteredTotal OT sites510211592229 Total SNVs442208535227 Coding region0000 RNA splicing0000 Upstream0000 Downstream3040 Intron1165111639 Intergene323157415188 Total indels683572 Coding region0000 RNA splicing0000 Up- and downstream0000 Intron151120 Intergene532452On-target exon1111 Open table in a new tab The OT effect is an important issue for both animal model construction and gene therapy.

In view of genome diversity and complex individual differences in monkeys, we focused on indels and filtered the data with steps similar to those used in the methods for rodents. We found that no functional OTs happened in single sgRNA-induced DMD monkey models. The above OT analysis indicated that gene targets in rodents and monkeys display different consequences, case by case. Therefore, with regard to safety concerns of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, OT analysis should be a regular assessment in model construction and therapeutic research. The result of no OT in the functional regions of the DMD monkey genome will encourage us to perform gene correction. Our present findings also imply that our previous result of presumptive OTs are faithful, demonstrating the stability in vivo and the safety of precise gene editing. With the improvement of efficacy, CRISPR/Cas9 would be better applied in clinical research and disease treatment. DMD rhesus monkey models were reported previously (8Chen Y. Zheng Y. Kang Y. Yang W.

For OT assessment, blood, ear tissues (cells), and muscle samples were taken in a minimally invasive manner from three 4-year-old healthy siblings, one of them an untreated WT control and the other two CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutant monkeys. All animal procedures were approved in advance by the institutional animal care and use committee and were performed in accordance with the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International for the ethical treatment of primates. Genomic DNA was extracted with the DNeasy blood and tissue kit (Qiagen) according to the kit instructions. The sequence of the targeting region was analyzed by PCR, and the complete process was performed by initial incubation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 20 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s and then 10 cycles of 98 °C for 10 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 40 s. The PCR products were purified, and 200 ng of DNA/sample was digested with 0.3 μl of T7 endonuclease in a 20-μl reaction volume for 30 min at 37 °C. Then the product was isolated by a 3% agarose gel. To assess mosaic status, purified PCR products were ligated with the TA cloning vector and transfected into Escherichia coli–competent cells. Single colonies were picked and sequenced, and chimeric rate was analyzed by sequencing results. A total of 17 presumptive OT sites were predicted with CCTop software (http://crispr.cos.uni-heidelberg.de/index.html) 5Please note that the JBC is not responsible for the long-term archiving and maintenance of this site or any other third party hosted site.

OTs were identified through Sanger sequences with specific primers (Table S2). Blood samples of WT-1, MT-1, and MT-2 monkeys were taken, and genomic DNA was subjected to standard whole-genome DNA library preparation for high-throughput sequencing (Illumina platform) with a mean coverage of 60×. According to the Illumina sequencing features, using double-end sequencing data, we required Q30 to have an average ratio above 80% and an average error rate below 0.1%.

Finally, we marked duplicate reads using Picard (http://sourceforge.net/projects/picard).5 All polymorphic SNVs and indel sites in the genome were extracted, and high-confidence SNVs and indel data sets were ultimately obtained and analyzed. Obtained data sets were used to compare the sgRNA sequence with the reference genome. All potential polymorphic SNVs and indels sites in the genome were extracted by SAMtools and Picard tools. We then ultimately obtained highly confident SNVs and indel data sets along with repeatability and other factors for further filtering. These OT sites contained 1–5 base mismatches with the 20-bp target sequence and at least one mismatch in the PAM-proximal seed region via the NCBI alignment tool blastn. To find more SNVs and indel sites, sgRNA homologous regions were amplified 150 bp in their upstream and downstream, respectively. All obtained potential OT sites were differentiated as exon (coding region), RNA splicing, up- and downstream, intronic, and intergenic regions.

https://openalex.org/W2809814483,"Over the last decade, the number of viral genome sequences deposited in available databases has grown exponentially. However, sequencing methodology vary widely and many published works have relied on viral enrichment by viral culture or nucleic acid amplification with specific primers rather than through unbiased techniques such as metagenomics. The genome of RNA viruses is highly variable and these enrichment methodologies may be difficult to achieve or may bias the results. In order to obtain genomic sequences of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) from positive nasopharyngeal aspirates diverse methodologies were evaluated and compared. A total of 29 nearly complete and complete viral genomes were obtained. The best performance was achieved with a DNase I treatment to the RNA directly extracted from the nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA), sequence-independent single-primer amplification (SISPA) and library preparation performed with Nextera XT DNA Library Prep Kit with manual normalization. An average of 633,789 and 1,674,845 filtered reads per library were obtained with MiSeq and NextSeq 500 platforms, respectively. The higher output of NextSeq 500 was accompanied by the increasing of duplicated reads percentage generated during SISPA (from an average of 1.5% duplicated viral reads in MiSeq to an average of 74% in NextSeq 500). HRSV genome recovery was not affected by the presence or absence of duplicated reads but the computational demand during the analysis was increased. Considering that only samples with viral load ≥ E+06 copies/ml NPA were tested, no correlation between sample viral loads and number of total filtered reads was observed, nor with the mapped viral reads. The HRSV genomes showed a mean coverage of 98.46% with the best methodology. In addition, genomes of human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV) and human parainfluenza virus types 1-3 (HPIV1-3) were also obtained with the selected optimal methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2810908011,"Background Allergy to bee and wasp venom can lead to life-threatening systemic reactions. The identification of the culprit species is important for allergen-specific immunotherapy. Objectives To determine a panel of recombinant bee and wasp allergens which is suitable for the identification of bee or wasp as culprit allergen sources and to search for molecular surrogates of clinical severity of sting reactions. Methods Sera from eighty-seven patients with a detailed documentation of their severity of sting reaction (Mueller grade) and who had been subjected to titrated skin testing with bee and wasp venom were analyzed for bee and wasp-specific IgE levels by ImmunoCAPTM. IgE-reactivity testing was performed using a comprehensive panel of recombinant bee and wasp venom allergens (rApi m 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 10; rVes v 1 and 5) by ISAC chip technology, ImmunoCAP and ELISA. IgG4 antibodies to rApi m 1 and rVes v 5 were determined by ELISA and IgE/IgG4 ratios were calculated. Results from skin testing, IgE serology and IgE/IgG4 ratios were compared with severity of sting reactions. Results The panel of rApi m 1, rApi m 10, rVes v 1 and rVes v 5 allowed identification of the culprit venom in all but two of the 87 patients with good agreement to skin testing. Severities of sting reactions were not associated with results obtained by skin testing, venom-specific IgE levels or molecular diagnosis. Severe sting reactions were observed in patients showing < 1 ISU and < 2kUA/L of IgE to Api m 1 and/or Ves v 5. Conclusion We identified a minimal panel of recombinant bee and wasp allergens for molecular diagnosis which may permit identification of bee and/or wasp as culprit insect in venom-sensitized subjects. The severity of sting reactions was not associated with parameters obtained by molecular diagnosis."
https://openalex.org/W2809745859,"Background A decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is reportedly associated with increased prevalence rates of cognitive impairment. However, data concerning the association between the cerebral saturation of oxygen (rSO2) and cognitive function of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) is limited. This study aimed to (i) elucidate the clinical factors associating with cerebral rSO2 and (ii) investigate the association between cerebral rSO2 and cognitive assessment in CKD patients. Methods A total of 40 CKD patients not requiring dialysis (26 men and 14 women; mean age, 61.0 ± 2.7 years) were recruited. The numbers of patients at each CKD stage were as follows: G1, 5; G2, 8; G3a, 6; G3b, 5; G4, 11; and G5, 5. Cerebral rSO2 was monitored at the forehead using the oxygen saturation monitor INVOS 5100C. The cognitive function of each patient was confirmed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results Cerebral rSO2 levels were significantly higher in CKD patients than in hemodialysis patients (63.8 ± 1.5% vs. 44.9 ± 2.2%, p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that cerebral rSO2 was independently associated with eGFR (standardized coefficient: 0.530), serum albumin concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.365), and serum sodium concentration (standardized coefficient: 0.224). Furthermore, MMSE showed a significantly positive correlation with cerebral rSO2 (r = 0.624, p < 0.001). Conclusions Cerebral rSO2 was affected by eGFR and serum albumin and sodium concentrations in CKD patients. Furthermore, cerebral rSO2 monitoring, which reflected MMSE scores, might be a useful method for assessing cognitive function in CKD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2809927759,"Climate screens are typically used inside glass greenhouses to improve control of humidity and temperature, and thus reduce energy expenditure. Shade nets are more appropriate to use, either with or without polyethylene cladding, at locations less-reliant on climate control, but where protection against hail, wind and excessive solar radiation might be needed. In addition, insect screens and nets can be employed to hinder insect pests and other invertebrates entering either type of production environment, and to keep invertebrates used in pest management contained inside. Screens and nets both transmit sunlight in a wavelength-specific manner, giving them the potential to affect plant morphology and physiology. Screens and nets of various colours and nominal shading factors have been described and studied; however, detailed measurements of their spectral characteristics are scarce. We measured solar spectral photon-irradiance and its attenuation by climate screens, shade nets, insect nets, greenhouse glass, and polyethylene covers. Our aim was to elucidate the effects of different patterns, colours, and shading factors, on light quality in production environments. Our measurements reveal that there are large differences both in the fraction of global irradiance attenuated and spectral ratios received under materials that are otherwise superficially similar in terms of their appearance and texture. We suggest that the type of spectral characterization that we performed is required to fully interpret the results of research examining plant responses to different types of screen and net. These data on spectral irradiance would benefit material manufacturers, researchers, growers, and horticultural consultants, enabling material selection to better match the solutions sought by growers and their desired outcomes regarding plant performance."
https://openalex.org/W2810725449,"The inventory and input/output balance of trace elements in farmland play an important role in risk assessment and soil management, but there is little information about nationwide changes of the input/output balance of trace elements in farmland in China. In the present study, the inventory of trace element inputs to farmland was updated based on the dataset from the literature published during 2006-2015, and changes of the input/output balance were investigated. Compared with 1999-2006, net inputs of Cr, Ni, and Zn increased by 52.9%, 59.7%, and 20.6%, respectively. The increases in fossil fuel derived energy consumption, industrial manufacture, municipal solid waste incineration, and transportation were the predominant contributors to these increases. Net inputs of Cd, Cu, and Hg decreased dramatically by 46.7%, 25.2%, and 50.4%, respectively. The decreases are due to the strict management of feed additives, fertilizers, and emissions of atmospheric pollutants. Net inputs of As and Pb still remained relatively stable. These results demonstrated that better achievements have been gained by administration of air, water and soil in China. Regulation of atmospheric emission for Cr, Ni, and Zn was recommended as atmospheric deposition was the predominant source for increases of Cr, Ni, and Zn inputs to farmland across China."
https://openalex.org/W2811000215,"Background Experiences during a stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), including pain, delirium, physical deterioration, and the critical illness itself, may all influence survivors’ health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, few studies have examined the influence of social support, comorbidity, and pain interference on ICU survivors’ HRQOL. Objectives To investigate possible associations between social support, number of comorbidities, and pain interference on HRQOL in ICU survivors. Methods ICU survivors responded to a survey 3 months (n = 118) and 1 year (n = 89) after ICU discharge. HRQOL was measured using the Short Form Health Survey-12 (v1), social support using the revised Social Provision Scale, pain interference using the Brief Pain Inventory–Short Form, and comorbidities using the Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire. Results Physical and mental HRQOL were reduced at both 3 months and 1 year in ICU survivors compared with the general population. This reduction was more pronounced at 3 months for physical HRQOL, while a small reduction in mental HRQOL was not clinically relevant. Social support was statistical significantly positively associated with mental HRQOL at 3 months, while number of comorbidities was statistical significantly associated with a reduction in physical HRQOL at 3 months and 1 year and mental HRQOL at 1 year. Lastly pain interference was significantly associated with a reduction in physical HRQOL at 3 months and 1 year. Conclusions ICU survivors primarily report reduced physical HRQOL. Social support was positively associated with mental HRQOL, while number of comorbidities, and pain interference were all significantly associated with a reduction in HRQOL. Pain interference was associated with the largest reduction in HRQOL."
https://openalex.org/W2810878132,"The incorporation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for generating in vitro models that truly represent the microarchitecture found in human tissues. However, the cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions in vitro remains poorly understood in placental trophoblast biology. We investigated the effects of varying the surface properties (surface thickness and stiffness) of two ECMs, collagen I and Matrigel, on placental trophoblast cell morphology, viability, proliferation, and expression of markers involved in differentiation/syncytial fusion. Most notably, thicker Matrigel surfaces were found to induce the self-assembly of trophoblast cells into 3D spheroids that exhibited thickness-dependent changes in viability, proliferation, syncytial fusion, and gene expression profiles compared to two-dimensional cultures. Changes in F-actin organization, cell spread morphologies, and integrin and matrix metalloproteinase gene expression profiles, further reveal that the response to surface thickness may be mediated in part through cellular stiffness-sensing mechanisms. Our derivation of self-assembling trophoblast spheroid cultures through regulation of ECM surface alone contributes to a deeper understanding of cell-ECM interactions, and may be important for the advancement of in vitro platforms for research or diagnostics."
https://openalex.org/W2809926919,"TGF-β signaling is a cellular pathway that functions in most cells and has been shown to play a role in multiple processes, such as the immune response, cell differentiation and proliferation. Recent evidence suggests a possible interaction between TGF-β signaling and the molecular circadian oscillator. The current study aims to characterize this interaction in the zebrafish at the molecular and behavioral levels, taking advantage of the early development of a functional circadian clock and the availability of light-entrainable clock-containing cell lines.Smad3a, a TGF-β signaling-related gene, exhibited a circadian expression pattern throughout the brain of zebrafish larvae. Both pharmacological inhibition and indirect activation of TGF-β signaling in zebrafish Pac-2 cells caused a concentration dependent disruption of rhythmic promoter activity of the core clock gene Per1b. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling in intact zebrafish larvae caused a phase delay in the rhythmic expression of Per1b mRNA. TGF-β inhibition also reversibly disrupted, phase delayed and increased the period of circadian rhythms of locomotor activity in zebrafish larvae.The current research provides evidence for an interaction between the TGF-β signaling pathway and the circadian clock system at the molecular and behavioral levels, and points to the importance of TGF-β signaling for normal circadian clock function. Future examination of this interaction should contribute to a better understanding of its underlying mechanisms and its influence on a variety of cellular processes including the cell cycle, with possible implications for cancer development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W2810604767,"Wild rodents are important hosts for tick larvae but co-infestations with other mites and insects are largely neglected. Small rodents were trapped at four study sites in Berlin, Germany, to quantify their ectoparasite diversity. Host-specific, spatial and temporal occurrence of ectoparasites was determined to assess their influence on direct and indirect zoonotic risk due to mice and voles in an urban agglomeration. Rodent-associated arthropods were diverse, including 63 species observed on six host species with an overall prevalence of 99%. The tick Ixodes ricinus was the most prevalent species, found on 56% of the rodents. The trapping location clearly affected the presence of different rodent species and, therefore, the occurrence of particular host-specific parasites. In Berlin, fewer temporary and periodic parasite species as well as non-parasitic species (fleas, chiggers and nidicolous Gamasina) were detected than reported from rural areas. In addition, abundance of parasites with low host-specificity (ticks, fleas and chiggers) apparently decreased with increasing landscape fragmentation associated with a gradient of urbanisation. In contrast, stationary ectoparasites, closely adapted to the rodent host, such as the fur mites Myobiidae and Listrophoridae, were most abundant at the two urban sites. A direct zoonotic risk of infection for people may only be posed by Nosopsyllus fasciatus fleas, which were prevalent even in the city centre. More importantly, peridomestic rodents clearly supported the life cycle of ticks in the city as hosts for their subadult stages. In addition to trapping location, season, host species, body condition and host sex, infestation with fleas, gamasid Laelapidae mites and prostigmatic Myobiidae mites were associated with significantly altered abundance of I. ricinus larvae on mice and voles. Whether this is caused by predation, grooming behaviour or interaction with the host immune system is unclear. The present study constitutes a basis to identify interactions and vector function of rodent-associated arthropods and their potential impact on zoonotic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2810268382,"Wheat grains are an important source of human food but current production amounts cannot meet world needs. Environmental conditions such as high temperature (above 30°C) could affect wheat production negatively. Plants from two wheat genotypes have been subjected to two growth temperature regimes. One set has been grown at an optimum daily mean temperature of 19°C while the second set of plants has been subjected to warming at 27°C from two to 13 days after anthesis (daa). While warming did not affect mean grain number per spike, it significantly reduced other yield-related indicators such as grain width, length, volume and maximal cell numbers in the endosperm. Whole genome expression analysis identified 6,258 and 5,220 genes, respectively, whose expression was affected by temperature in the two genotypes. Co-expression analysis using WGCNA (Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis) uncovered modules (groups of co-expressed genes) associated with agronomic traits. In particular, modules enriched in genes related to nutrient reservoir and endopeptidase inhibitor activities were found to be positively associated with cell numbers in the endosperm. A hypothetical model pertaining to the effects of warming on gene expression and growth in wheat grain is proposed. Under moderately high temperature conditions, network analyses suggest a negative effect of the expression of genes related to seed storage proteins and starch biosynthesis on the grain size in wheat."

The most common surgical indications for corneal transplantation were Fuchs' endothelial corneal dystrophy (35.2%) and keratoconus (18.9%) with keratoconus being the leading cause during early years (from 2004 to 2009) and Fuch's dystrophy being the leading cause from 2010 to 2015. Overall, the total count of performed keratoplasties increased, from 385 corneal transplantations during the first 6-year period to 800 corneal transplantations during the second 6-year period (P = 0.008, using Mann-Whitney test). The Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty has become the favored surgical method for endothelial disorders with the number of Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasties increasing significantly from 2008 to 2015. This increasing trend was statistically significant (P < 0.001 using multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS). A decreasing trend was also noted for the rate of penetrating keratoplasty since 2008 (P < 0.001 using MARS).This research showed major changes in the preferred corneal transplantation techniques and leading indications for keratoplasty over the last 12 years. More importantly, it seems that the rapid development and implementation of endothelial keratoplasty, especially the Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty, has had a profound effect on and begun a new era in corneal transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2809764229,"Ants are emerging model systems to study cellular signaling because distinct castes possess different physiologic phenotypes within the same colony. Here we studied the functionality of inotocin signaling, an insect ortholog of mammalian oxytocin (OT), which was recently discovered in ants. In Lasius ants, we determined that specialization within the colony, seasonal factors, and physiologic conditions down-regulated the expression of the OT-like signaling system. Given this natural variation, we interrogated its function using RNAi knockdowns. Next-generation RNA sequencing of OT-like precursor knock-down ants highlighted its role in the regulation of genes involved in metabolism. Knock-down ants exhibited higher walking activity and increased self-grooming in the brood chamber.

https://openalex.org/W2809950152,"Ischemic heart disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Interventional reperfusion induces further damage to the ischemic myocardium through neutrophil infiltration and acute inflammation. As caspase recruitment domain-containing protein 9 (CARD9) plays a critical role in innate immune response and inflammation, we hypothesized that CARD9 knockout would provide protection against ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury through attenuation of acute inflammatory responses. C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and CARD9-/- mice were subjected to 45 min left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion followed by 24-h reperfusion. Area at risk (AAR) and infarct size were measured by Evans blue and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Frozen heart sections were stained with anti-mouse GR-1 antibody to detect infiltrated neutrophils. Concentrations of cytokines/chemokines TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL-1 and MCP-1 were determined in heart tissue homogenate and serum by ELISA assay. Western immunoblotting analyses were performed to measure the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK. Our results indicate that following I/R, infarct size was significantly smaller in CARD9-/- mice compared to WT. The number of infiltrated neutrophils was significantly lower in CARD9-/- mice compared to WT. Levels of TNF-α, IL-6, CXCL-1 and MCP-1 were significantly reduced in heart tissue and serum from CARD9-/- mice compared to WT. CARD9-/- mice also exhibited significantly lower levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK. Taken together, our results suggest that CARD9 knockout protects the heart from ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, possibly through reduction of neutrophil infiltration and attenuation of CARD9-associated acute inflammatory signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2809960384,"Efficient conversion of cellulosic sugars in cellulosic hydrolysates is important for economically viable production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass, but the goal remains a critical challenge. The present study reports a new approach for simultaneous fermentation of cellobiose and xylose by using the co-culture consisting of recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae specialist strains. The co-culture system can provide competitive advantage of modularity compared to the single culture system and can be tuned to deal with fluctuations in feedstock composition to achieve robust and cost-effective biofuel production. This study characterized fermentation kinetics of the recombinant cellobiose-consuming S. cerevisiae strain EJ2, xylose-consuming S. cerevisiae strain SR8, and their co-culture. The motivation for kinetic modeling was to provide guidance and prediction of using the co-culture system for simultaneous fermentation of mixed sugars with adjustable biomass of each specialist strain under different substrate concentrations. The kinetic model for the co-culture system was developed based on the pure culture models and incorporated the effects of product inhibition, initial substrate concentration and inoculum size. The model simulations were validated by results from independent fermentation experiments under different substrate conditions, and good agreement was found between model predictions and experimental data from batch fermentation of cellobiose, xylose and their mixtures. Additionally, with the guidance of model prediction, simultaneous co-fermentation of 60 g/L cellobiose and 20 g/L xylose was achieved with the initial cell densities of 0.45 g dry cell weight /L for EJ2 and 0.9 g dry cell weight /L SR8. The results demonstrated that the kinetic modeling could be used to guide the design and optimization of yeast co-culture conditions for achieving simultaneous fermentation of cellobiose and xylose with improved ethanol productivity, which is critically important for robust and efficient renewable biofuel production from lignocellulosic biomass."

In this study, we found that lipin-1 deficiency in mice is associated with a marked accumulation of abnormal mitochondria and autophagic vacuoles in glycolytic muscle fibers. Our studies using lipin-1-deficient myoblasts suggest that lipin-1 participates in B-cell leukemia (BCL)-2 adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (Bnip3)-regulated mitophagy by interacting with microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain (LC)3, which is an important step in the recruitment of mitochondria to nascent autophagosomes. The requirement of lipin-1 for Bnip3-mediated mitophagy was further verified in vivo in lipin-1-deficient green fluorescent protein-LC3 transgenic mice (lipin-1-/--GFP-LC3). Finally, we showed that lipin-1 deficiency in mice resulted in defective mitochondrial adaptation to starvation-induced metabolic stress and impaired contractile muscle force in glycolytic muscle fibers. In summary, our study suggests that deregulated mitophagy arising from lipin-1 deficiency is associated with impaired muscle function and may contribute to muscle rhabdomyolysis in humans.-Alshudukhi, A.

https://openalex.org/W2811390491,"The social and economic consequences of the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2007-9 has had serious impacts on population health, economic prospects, and overall wellbeing in all generations, particularly Millennials, Generation X, and Baby Boomers. The ways in which intergenerational inequality and global economic crises have affected population health, particularly with respect to excessive drinking and substance use in disadvantaged population groups has been understudied. Consequently, in this article, we seek to characterise the effects of the GFC on national trends in binge alcohol and substance use among Millennials, Generation X, and Baby Boomers. By doing so, we aim to contribute to a fuller understanding of the ways in which socioeconomic disadvantage engendered by the GFC has disparately affected the wellbeing of these generational cohorts.We present results from National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2007-16 to characterise binge alcohol and substance use among different generational cohorts in the United States during and after the GFC. Bivariate descriptive analysis and maximum-likelihood logit regressions focused on: (a) individual substances and binge drinking, (b) poly-use and (c) any use to simultaneously model how socioeconomic, demographic, and health characteristics were related to past-month substance use and to report the social, economic, and demographic correlates of substance use. Socioeconomic vulnerability was captured on a five-point scale comprised of: (1) health insurance status, (2) government assistance, (3) income, (4) self rated health, and (5) employment status. Millennials showed generally higher risk of binge alcohol and substance use during 2007-16 than Generation X, while Baby Boomers generally exhibited lower risk. Comparison of individual and poly-use patterns for the birth cohorts before and after reveals: Millennials were at significantly increased risk of use of binge alcohol (AOR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.46-1.56), cocaine (AOR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.03-1.37), heroin (AOR = 1.39; 95% CI = 1.01-1.91), and oxycontin (AOR = 2.33; 95% CI = 1.74-3.12) than Gen X while Baby Boomers were at significantly reduced risk of all substances. Nevertheless, Millennials were at significantly reduced risk of crack use (AOR = 0.33; 95% CI = 0.25-0.43) and poly-use (AOR = 0.56; 95% CI = 0.45-0.70) compared to Gen X. These differences may be related to measures of austerity and socioeconomic vulnerability. Millennials exhibited the highest vulnerability related to austerity with an average vulnerability score of 0.97 (95% CI = 0.96-0.98) while Baby Boomers exhibited the lowest average vulnerability score of 0.65 (95% CI = 0.64-0.66) with Generation X in between with 0.72 (95% CI = 0.71-0.73). Increased social and economic vulnerability after the 2007 crisis is strongly associated with higher rates of substance use in all generations.Millennials have been especially affected by socioeconomic changes associated with the GFC as reflected by their heightened vulnerability and increased use of binge alcohol and other substances compared to preceding generations. These findings suggest that attention is needed to address disparities in socioeconomic vulnerability, relationships to substance use and overall mental health of Millennials to mitigate the potential long term negative impacts of the GFC. In the context of a continuing international opioid and heroin crisis, the ways in which Millennials have been differentially affected warrants much greater attention both from policymakers and from researchers."

We demonstrate a method to combine bio-conjugation, SDS-PAGE, and silver staining in order to separate carbon nanotubes on the basis of length. Egg-white lysozyme, conjugated covalently onto the single-walled carbon nanotubes surfaces using carbodiimide method. The proposed conjugation of a biomolecule onto the carbon nanotubes surfaces is a novel idea and a significant step forward for creating an indicator for length-based carbon nanotubes separation. The conjugation step was followed by SDS-PAGE and the nanotube fragments were precisely visualized using silver staining. This high precision, inexpensive, rapid and simple separation method obviates the need for centrifugation, additional chemical analyses, and expensive spectroscopic techniques such as Raman spectroscopy to visualize carbon nanotube bands. In this method, we measured the length of nanotubes using different image analysis techniques which is based on a simplified hydrodynamic model. The method has high precision and resolution and is effective in separating the nanotubes by length which would be a valuable quality control tool for the manufacture of carbon nanotubes of specific lengths in bulk quantities. To this end, we were also able to measure the carbon nanotubes of different length, produced from different sonication time intervals."

The goal of this study was to explore the effects of phthalates on the growth of normal MCF-10A breast cells modulated by breast fibroblasts. Fibroblasts were derived from normal mammary tissue adjacent to both estrogen receptor (ER) positive and negative primary breast cancers, which were grown separately from nontumorigenic MCF-10A epithelial cells. MCF-10A co-culture cells were treated with 10 nM 17β-estradiol (E2), Butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), di(n-butyl) phthalate (DBP), and di(20ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) (10 and 100 nM). After incubation for 120 hours, the cells were harvested and extracted for MTT assay. Western blot analysis was used to evaluate the proliferative pathway proteins and the effects on ER α. Only fibroblasts from ER (+) breast cancer significantly stimulated proliferation of MCF-10A cells. Exposure of the co-culture to E2, BBP, DBP, DEHP, and E2 combined with one of these phthalates resulted in significantly increased cell proliferation, as well as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and ER α expressions. The present study demonstrates that phthalates express a significant influence in fibroblast-epithelial interactions, similarly to the effects of E2 on breast cells. The effects of phthalates on normal breast cells depend upon ER modulating actions. In breast carcinogenesis, phthalates should be considered as having endocrine disrupting potential, even at low concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2811415807,"In protected areas around the world, wildlife habituate to humans and human infrastructure, potentially resulting in human-wildlife conflict, and leading to trophic disruptions through excess herbivory and disconnection of predators from prey. For large species that threaten human safety, wildlife managers sometimes attempt to reverse habituation with aversive conditioning. This technique associates people as a conditioned stimulus with a negative, unconditioned stimulus, such as pain or fright, to increase wariness and prevent the need for lethal wildlife management. Resistance to aversive conditioning by some habituated individuals often results in more frequent conditioning events by managers, but there are few studies of conditioning frequency with which to evaluate the usefulness of this management response. We evaluated the effect of conditioning frequency on the wariness of elk (Cervus canadensis) by subjecting marked individuals to predator-resembling chases by people over a period of three months. In that time, animals were subjected to conditioning a total of 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9 times which we analyzed as both an ordinal variable and a binary one divided into low (3–5) and high (6–9) conditioning frequencies. We measured wariness before, during, and after the conditioning period using flight response distances from an approaching researcher. During the conditioning period, overall wariness increased significantly for elk in both treatment groups, although the increase was significantly greater in individuals subjected to high conditioning frequencies. However in the post-conditioning period, wariness gains also declined most in the high-frequency group, equating to more rapid extinction of learned behaviour. Across all treatment frequencies, rapid changes in flight responses also characterized the individuals with the lowest wariness at the beginning of the study period, suggesting that individuals with greater behavioural flexibility are more likely to habituate to both people and their attempts to change wariness via aversive conditioning. Together, our results imply that aversive conditioning may be most effective at intermediate frequencies and that its utility might be further increased with proactive assessment of individual personalities in habituated wildlife."
https://openalex.org/W2810161438,"Soil salinization is a major factor limiting crop growth and development in many areas. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is an important warm-season grass species used for biofuel production. The objective of this study was to investigate antioxidant metabolism, proline,and protein variation associated with alkali-salt tolerance among 30 switchgrass lines and identify metabolic markers for evaluating alkali-salt tolerance of switchgrass lines. The grass lines were transplanted into plastic pots containing fine sand. When the plants reached E5 developmental stage, they were subjected to either alkali-salt stress treatment (150 mM Na+ and pH of 9.5) or control (no alkali-salt stress) for 20 d. The 30 switchgrass lines differed in alkali-salt tolerance as determined by the level of leaf malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant enzyme activity [(superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX)], proline and protein. Alkali-salt stress increased MDA, proline, SOD, reduced CAT activity, but its effect on protein and APX varied depending on lines. Wide variations in the five parameters existed among the 30 lines. In general, the lines with higher CAT activity and lower proline content under alkali-salt stress had less MDA, exhibiting better alkali-salt tolerance. Among the five parameters, CAT can be considered as valuable metabolic markers for assessment of switchgrass tolerance to alkali-salt stress."
https://openalex.org/W2810302726,"Very little information is available on emergence of rare arable plants (RAP) in relation to soil disturbance and seed burial conditions in Europe. This information is essential to design conservation and soil management strategies to prevent the decline of these species in agroecosystems. The objective of this research was to investigate the effect of soil cultivation with burial time on the emergence and seed persistence of RAP. Seeds of 30 RAP species were collected from Spanish arable fields and subjected to two tillage treatments: (a) no soil disturbance, and (b) autumnal soil disturbance down to 10 cm depth every year. The treatments simulated no-till and tilled (disking), respectively. In plots under no-till, RAP seeds were sown at 1-cm depth. In the tilled plots, seeds were sown homogeneously mixed in the top 1–10 cm of soil. The trial was established every two consecutive seasons, and each trial was maintained for two years. Annual cumulative plant emergence was calculated each year; whereas the first trial was monitored for a third year to estimate seed longevity using a persistence index. The response in emergence of the 30 RAP to annual tillage varied among species. With burial time (number of years), higher emergence was observed for seeds sown in tilled soil. This was true across all species, and with strong season effects. The persistence index was correlated with seed weight, species with bigger seeds had low persistence indices while no pattern was observed for small seeded species. Most RAP species, particularly those with high persistence, showed induction of secondary dormancy processes, highlighting the importance of tillage to promote RAP emergence, and hence, seed bank replenishment. Therefore, as time passes the absence of soil tillage may represent a driver of RAP seed bank decline for those species with secondary dormancy processes. In conclusion, it is important to design soil management strategies, such as regular tillage to promote emergence, on a species basis to preserve RAP in Europe."
https://openalex.org/W2811367759,"Tuberculosis is a major public health problem in Liberia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the incidence of tuberculosis in Liberia is significantly increasing from year to year. However, little is known about the performance of the programme and the challenges after the 14 years of civil war which ended in 2003.The purpose of the study was to evaluate the performance of the TB programme of Liberia.The study utilised mixed research design; both quantitative and qualitative methods were used in this study conducted from 2013 to 2014. For the quantitative part of the study, a questionnaire, laboratory performance and eleven years TB programme data (2003-2013) were used. For the performance of tuberculosis laboratory testing, all the 107 functional tuberculosis microscopy centers in Liberia were included. For the qualitative part of the study, an interview of 10 informants and two focus group discussions (FGDs) were also conducted, each comprising of eight people. Themes and subthemes emerged from the two FGDs. Data was analysed in line with the Donabedian model. Quantitative findings were analysed and presented using both descriptive and inferential statistics.The study findings pointed out that there was overall improvement in the performance of the tuberculosis control programme in Liberia from 2003 to 2013. The percentage of cured patients was 60% in 2005 and 62% in 2013. Percentage of treatment completed was 16% in 2005 and 21% in 2013. The case detection rate was 57% and treatment success rate 80% in 2013. The default rate was 11% in 2013. Of the 139 participants, 120 (86%) completed TB treatment while 19 (14%) did not.Between 2003 and 2013, the National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Control Programme (NLTCP) succeeded in restoring the TB services and improving some of the TB treatment outcomes including the Directly observed treatment short courses(DOTS) coverage. Despite these improvements, the TB treatment, laboratory services and human resource capacity lagged behind. The TB programme of Liberia needs to develop new strategies to address its challenges."

In order to assess the biological effects on the wild population of black scallops, bivalves were place in four different locations: in the three ports (semi-closed areas), and in a marshland uncontaminated site (closed area). Biomarkers of effects (heavy metals) and exposure (oxidative stress and immunological effects) were assessed in the digestive glands of specimens in order to compare two techniques of sampling: “pool” technique and “inter-subject” technique. Our findings reported in the both techniques show significant modulation of GST (detoxification), SOD (antioxidant response) and MDA (lipid peroxidation) in bivalves exposed to a specific contamination in each port. Laccase-type enzyme also highlighted an important aspect in terms of biomarker response of the immune function at the 7th day of exposition. Overall, our study demonstrated that the “pool” technique using the same quality indicator M. varia could be used to obtain reliable results at lower costs. In contrast, in fundamental context, the “inter-subject” technique could bring more precise results to light. However, it requires burdensome and costly handling."
https://openalex.org/W2811443836,"The human pulmonary valve, one of the key cardiac structures, plays an important role in circulatory system. However, there are few mathematical models to accurately simulate it. In this paper, we establish a geometric model of the normal human pulmonary valve from a mathematical perspective in the fully opening case. Based on the statistical data of the human pulmonary valves, we assume that the motions of the three cusps are symmetrical in the cardiac cycle. Thus, we first propose that each cusp is a part of the cylindrical shell according to its structure and physiological feature. The parameters for the pulmonary valve cusps in three-dimensional space are obtained by the fitting functions. We verify the accuracy of our results by comparing the areas of the pulmonary valve and pulmonary valve flap."
https://openalex.org/W2809692153,"There is much evidence that neural activity in the human brain is modulated by task difficulty, particularly in visual, frontal, and parietal cortices. However, some basic psychophysical tasks in visual perception do not give rise to this expected effect, at least not in the visual cortex. In the current study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to record brain activity while systematically manipulating task difficulty in a motion discrimination task, by varying the angular difference between the motion direction of random dots and a reference direction. We used both a blocked and an event-related design, and presented stimuli in both central and peripheral vision. The behavioral psychometric function, across angular differences of 3°, 9°, 15°, or 80°, spanned the full response range, as expected. The mean blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signals were also correlated within-participants between the blocked and event-related designs, across all brain areas tested. Within the visual cortex, the voxel response patterns correlated more within-conditions (e.g., 3° and 3°) than between-conditions (e.g., 3° and 9°), in both designs, further attesting to the reasonable quality of the BOLD data. Nevertheless, the BOLD-o-metric functions (i.e., BOLD activity as a function of task difficulty) were flat in the whole-brain and region-of-interest (ROI) analyses, including in the visual cortex, the parietal cortex, in both designs, and in foveal and peripheral visual fields alike. Indeed, there was little difference between BOLD activity during the 3° and 80° conditions. Some suggestive evidence of difficulty modulation was revealed only in the superior and inferior frontal gyri for the blocked design. We conclude that, in motion discrimination, there is no systematic BOLD modulation that accompanies the standard psychometric function across different hierarchies of cortical areas, except for the frontal lobe of the brain."

Whether S. invicta stings also have negative effects on mental health is not clear. In the present study, the psychological impact of S. invicta stings was evaluated using a questionnaire that included a previously published posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) checklist, the Patient Health Questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scale, the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 5th scale (PSQI(5)). A total of 96 valid questionnaires were obtained; 37 participants were placed in the stung group, and 59 participants were placed in the unstung group. Our results showed that symptoms of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances were not associated with S. invicta stings (for GAD-7 scale, Pearson Chi-Square test, χ2 = 0.152, df = 1, P = 0.697; for the BAI, χ2 = 2.252, df = 1, P = 0.133; for the PHQ-9, χ2 = 0.098, df = 1, P = 0.754; for the PSQI(5), χ2 = 0.536, df = 1, P = 0.453). In total, 2 of 83 individuals stung by S. invicta met the criteria (>50) for PTSD. However, there was no significant difference on PTSD between those stung by S. invicta in the 30-day group and the over 30-day group (χ2 = 0.318, df = 1, P = 0.573). Overall, our data do not show an effect of S. invicta stings on mental health as measured using a range of indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2810162157,"Extra-articular manifestations of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), potentially due to systemic inflammation, include cardiovascular disease and sarcopenic obesity. Adiponectin, an adipose-derived cytokine, has been implicated in inflammatory processes in RA, but little is known regarding its association with inflammation in a pre-clinical period. Therefore, we investigated whether adiponectin was associated with inflammatory markers in individuals at risk for RA, and whether RA-related autoimmunity modifies these associations.We analyzed samples from 144 first-degree relatives (FDRs) of RA probands, of whom 23 were positive for anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and/or ≥ 2 rheumatoid factor isotypes (IgM, IgG or IgA). We called this phenotype the 'high risk autoantibody profile (HRP)' as it has been shown in prior work to be >96% specific for future RA. We measured adiponectin, cytokines, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Using linear mixed effects models, we evaluated interaction between HRP positivity and adiponectin on inflammatory markers, adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, body mass index, pack-years smoking, and use of cholesterol-lowering medications.In everyone, adiponectin concentration was inversely associated with hsCRP and IL-1β in adjusted models, where a 1% higher adiponectin was associated with a 26% lower hsCRP (p = 0.04) and a 26% lower IL-1β (p = 0.04). Significant interactions between HRP and adiponectin for associations with GM-CSF, IL-6, and IL-9 were detected in fully adjusted models (p = 0.0006, p = 0.006, p = 0.01, respectively). In HRP positive FDRs but not HRP negative FDRs, a 1% higher adiponectin was associated with 97% higher GM-CSF, 73% higher IL-6, and 54% higher IL-9 concentrations.Adiponectin associates with inflammatory markers, and these associations differ in individuals with a high-risk autoantibody profile compared with those without. The interaction between adiponectin and autoimmunity warrants further investigation into the potential systemic effects of RA-related autoantibodies and adiponectin on inflammation in the absence of clinically apparent RA."
https://openalex.org/W2811366505,"A number of studies have demonstrated that the Sirtuin family member, Sirt1, is a key integrator of growth, metabolism, and lifespan. Sirt1 directly interacts with and deacetylates key regulators of the circadian clock, positioning it to be an important link between feeding and circadian rhythms. In fact, one study suggests that Sirt1 is necessary for behavioral anticipation of limited daily food availability, a circadian process termed food anticipatory activity (FAA). In their study, mice overexpressing Sirt1 had enhanced FAA, while mice lacking Sirt1 had little to no FAA. Based on the supposition that Sirt1 was indeed required for FAA, we sought to use Sirt1 deletion to map the neural circuitry responsible for FAA. We began by inactivating Sirt1 using the cell-type specific Cre-driver lines proopiomelanocortin, but after observing no effect on body weight loss or FAA we then moved on to more broadly neuronal Cre drivers Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and nestin. As neither of these neuronal deletions of Sirt1 had impaired FAA, we then tested 1) a broad postnatal tamoxifen-inducible deletion, 2) a complete, developmental knockout of Sirt1, and 3) a gene replacement, catalytically inactive, form of Sirt1; but all of these mice had FAA similar to controls. Therefore, our findings suggest that FAA is completely independent of Sirt1."

A 6.48 log10 reduction of P. rhodanensis was achieved at 500V for 80 pulse. The fluorescent staining with Propidium Iodide (PI) verified that the rate of sublethal injury cells maximum up to 27.2% under 200 V. MPEF can cause the damage of cell morphology and ultrastructure, meanwhile causing a decrease in cellular enzymes, antioxidant enzyme activity and cell membrane fluidity. The leakage of intracellular compounds (protein, nucleic acid, K+, Mg2+) and Ca2+-ATPase gradually increased as the growth of voltage, especially the proportion of protein in the supernatants increased from 2.0% to 26.4%. Flow cytometry analysis showed that MPEF has significant effect on membrane potential, but no obvious influence on non-specific esterase. MPEF can cause the changing of the secondary structure of protein, at the same time, double helix structure of DNA became loose and unwinding. These results provide a theoretical guidance for the widespread using of MPEF technology in the application of a non-thermal processing technique for food."
https://openalex.org/W2810598659,"The village and street dogs represent a unique model of canine populations. In the absence of selective breeding and veterinary care, they are subject mostly to natural selection. Their analyses contribute to understanding general mechanisms governing the genetic diversity, evolution and adaptation. In this study, we analyzed the genetic diversity and population structure of African village dogs living in villages in three different geographical areas in Northern Kenya. Data obtained for neutral microsatellite molecular markers were compared with those computed for potentially non-neutral markers of candidate immunity-related genes. The neutral genetic diversity was similar to other comparable village dog populations studied so far. The overall genetic diversity in microsatellites was higher than the diversity of European pure breeds, but it was similar to the range of diversity observed in a group composed of many European breeds, indicating that the African population has maintained a large proportion of the genetic diversity of the canine species as a whole. Microsatellite marker diversity indicated that the entire population is subdivided into three genetically distinct, although closely related subpopulations. This genetical partitioning corresponded to their geographical separation and the observed gene flow well correlated with the communication patterns among the three localities. In contrast to neutral microsatellites, the genetic diversity in immunity-related candidate SNP markers was similar across all three subpopulations and to the European group. It seems that the genetic structure of this particular population of Kenyan village dogs is mostly determined by geographical and anthropogenic factors influencing the gene flow between various subpopulations rather than by biological factors, such as genetic contribution of original migrating populations and/or the pathogen-mediated selection. On the other hand, the study of oldest surviving dogs suggested a biological mechanism, i.e. a possible advantage of the overal heterozygosity marked by the the microsatellite loci analyzed."
https://openalex.org/W2811007503,"T cells play a crucial role in orchestrating body immune responses. T cell hyperfunction, however, leads to inflammation and induction of autoimmune diseases. Understanding of T cell regulation mechanisms and successful modulation of T cell responses is beneficial in treatment of disease associated to T cell hyperresponsiveness. Our previous study indicated that monoclonal antibody (mAb) P-3E10, a mAb to Na, K ATPase β3 subunit, inhibited anti-CD3-induced PBMC proliferation. In the current study, we further investigated the mechanism of mAb P-3E10 in the induction of T cell hypofunction. We demonstrated that mAb P-3E10 decreased T cell proliferation and Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokine production. Monocytes were the cells playing a key role in mediation of mAb P-3E10 induced T cell hypofunction. The inhibition of T cell activation by mAb P-3E10 required cell contact between monocytes and T cells. The mAb P-3E10 induced the down-expression level of MHC class II and CD86 and increased IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-α production of monocytes. We concluded that ligation of the Na, K ATPase β3 subunit on monocytes by mAb P-3E10 arbitrated T cell hypofunction. This mAb might be a promising novel immunotherapeutic antibody for the treatment of hyperresponsive T cell associated diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2810966613,"Heterosporis sutherlandae is an emerging microsporidian fish parasite in the Great Lakes region. H. sutherlandae forms lesions in the muscle tissue of fishes important to aquaculture and sport fishing. These lesions render the filet inedible and may have fitness consequences. We evaluated the prevalence and severity of H. sutherlandae among yellow perch (Perca flavescens) in a known-positive Minnesota lake, and used an equilibrium yield model to evaluate impacts on harvest. Twenty-eight percent of the 400 yellow perch sampled were infected with H. sutherlandae. Males were 1.5 times more likely to be infected than females and were more severely infected. The presence of the parasite did not vary with relative weight or age, but infection severity was highest among older individuals that were in better condition. These results suggest that males are more susceptible to infection, and that infection is not associated with maturity or a gape-limiting food source. These results also suggest that heterosporosis increases in severity with time or by increased exposure. Our equilibrium yield model found that a 10% increase in mortality due to H. sutherlandae could result in 30% and 10% reductions in yield and mean catch weight, respectively. The results of this study direct future field sampling and laboratory experiments to further understand and predict the impacts of this parasite."
