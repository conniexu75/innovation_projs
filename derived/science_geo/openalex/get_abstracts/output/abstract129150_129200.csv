https://openalex.org/W2097767970,"Growth factors can promote cell survival by activating the phosphatidylinositide-3'-OH kinase and its downstream target, the serine-threonine kinase Akt. However, the mechanism by which Akt functions to promote survival is not understood. We show that growth factor activation of the PI3'K/Akt signaling pathway culminates in the phosphorylation of the BCL-2 family member BAD, thereby suppressing apoptosis and promoting cell survival. Akt phosphorylates BAD in vitro and in vivo, and blocks the BAD-induced death of primary neurons in a site-specific manner. These findings define a mechanism by which growth factors directly inactivate a critical component of the cell-intrinsic death machinery."
https://openalex.org/W1980768491,"Recently we purified a 900 kDa cytokine-responsive IκB kinase complex (IKK) and molecularly cloned one of its subunits, IKKα, a serine kinase. We now describe the molecular cloning and characterization of IKKβ, a second subunit of the IKK complex. IKKβ is 50% identical to IKKα and like it contains a kinase domain, a leucine zipper, and a helix-loop-helix. Although IKKα and IKKβ can undergo homotypic interaction, they also interact with each other and the functional IKK complex contains both subunits. The catalytic activities of both IKKα and IKKβ make essential contributions to IκB phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. While the interactions between IKKα and IKKβ may be mediated through their leucine zipper motifs, their helix-loop-helix motifs may be involved in interactions with essential regulatory subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2085052924,"Cyclooxygenase (COX) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs) and exists in two isoforms, COX-1 and COX-2. In spite of long-standing speculation, definitive roles of PGs in various events of early pregnancy remain elusive. We demonstrate herein that the targeted disruption of COX-2, but not COX-1, in mice produces multiple failures in female reproductive processes that include ovulation, fertilization, implantation, and decidualization. Using multiple approaches, we conclude that these defects are the direct result of target organ-specific COX-2 deficiency but are not the result of deficiency of pituitary gonadotropins or ovarian steroid hormones, or reduced responsiveness of the target organs to their respective hormones."
https://openalex.org/W2033228162,"We have reconstituted the ubiquitination pathway for the Cdk inhibitor Sic1 using recombinant proteins. Skp1, Cdc53, and the F-box protein Cdc4 form a complex, SCFCdc4, which functions as a Sic1 ubiquitin-ligase (E3) in combination with the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (E2) Cdc34 and E1. Cdc4 assembled with Skp1 functions as the receptor that selectively binds phosphorylated Sic1. Grr1, an F-box protein involved in Cln destruction, forms complexes with Skp1 and Cdc53 and binds phosphorylated Cln1 and Cln2, but not Sic1. Because the constituents of the SCF complex are members of protein families, SCFCdc4 is likely to serve as the prototype for a large class of E3s formed by combinatorial interactions of related family members. SCF complexes couple protein kinase signaling pathways to the control of protein abundance."
https://openalex.org/W1966034049,"In S. cerevisiae, the G1/S transition requires Cdc4p, Cdc34p, Cdc53p, Skp1p, and the Cln/Cdc28p cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk). These proteins are thought to promote the proteolytic inactivation of the S-phase Cdk inhibitor Sic1p. We show here that Cdc4p, Cdc53p, and Skp1p assemble into a ubiquitin ligase complex named SCFCdc4p. When mixed together, SCFCdc4p subunits, E1 enzyme, the E2 enzyme Cdc34p, and ubiquitin are sufficient to reconstitute ubiquitination of Cdk-phosphorylated Sic1p. Phosphorylated Sic1p substrate is specifically targeted for ubiquitination by binding to a Cdc4p/Skp1p subcomplex. Taken together, these data illuminate the molecular basis for the G1/S transition in budding yeast and suggest a general mechanism for phosphorylation-targeted ubiquitination in eukaryotes."
https://openalex.org/W2049344067,"The rat thyroid Na+/I− symporter (NIS) was expressed inXenopus laevis oocytes and characterized using electrophysiological, tracer uptake, and electron microscopic methods. NIS activity was found to be electrogenic and Na+-dependent (Na+ ≫ Li+ ≫ H+). The apparent affinity constants for Na+ and I− were 28 ± 3 mm and 33 ± 9 ॖm, respectively. Stoichiometry of Na+/anion cotransport was 2:1. NIS was capable of transporting a wide variety of anions (I−, ClO3−, SCN−, SeCN−, NO3−, Br−, BF4−, IO4−, BrO3−, but perchlorate (ClO4−) was not transported. In the absence of anion substrate, NIS exhibited a Na+-dependent leak current (∼357 of maximum substrate-induced current) with an apparent Na+ affinity of 74 ± 14 mm and a Hill coefficient (n) of 1. In response to step voltage changes, NIS exhibited current transients that relaxed with a time constant of 8–14 ms. Presteady-state charge movements (integral of the current transients) versus voltage relations obey a Boltzmann relation. The voltage for half-maximal charge translocation (V 0.5) was −15 ± 3 mV, and the apparent valence of the movable charge was 1. Total charge was insensitive to [Na+] o, but V 0.5 shifted to more negative potentials as [Na+] o was reduced. NIS charge movements are attributed to the conformational changes of the empty transporter within the membrane electric field. The turnover rate of NIS was ≥22 s−1 in the Na+ uniport mode and ≥36 s−1 in the Na+/I− cotransport mode. Transporter density in the plasma membrane was determined using freeze-fracture electron microscopy. Expression of NIS in oocytes led to a ∼2.5-fold increase in the density of plasma membrane protoplasmic face intramembrane particles. On the basis of the kinetic results, we propose an ordered simultaneous transport mechanism in which the binding of Na+ to NIS occurs first.

It is now firmly established that active accumulation of iodide (I−) by the thyroid gland epithelium, previously referred to as the 舠iodide pump舡 or 舠iodide trap,舡 is a Na+-dependent secondary active transport process mediated by the Na+/I− symporter (NIS), 1The abbreviations used are: NIS, Na+/I− symporter; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; FRTL, Fisher rat thyroid line; hPEPT1, human intestinal oligopeptide transporter; IMP, intramembrane particle; n, Hill coefficient; N, sample size; SGLT, Na+/glucose cotransporter; SMIT, Na+/myo-inositol cotransporter. an integral plasma membrane protein of the basolateral membrane of the thyroid gland follicular cells. Iodide transport into the thyroid gland has attracted substantial scientific and clinical interest due to the importance of I− in the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones triiodothyronine and tetraiodothyronine, and to the significance of NIS in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disorders (1Carrasco N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). A cDNA clone encoding NIS has recently been isolated, sequenced, and expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (2Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Oocytes injected with NIS cRNA exhibit a 700-fold increase in perchlorate-sensitive I− uptake. This study reports a comprehensive characterization of rat NIS function expressed in X. laevis oocytes. NIS activity is Na+-dependent and electrogenic, and the stoichiometry of cotransport is 2 Na+:1 anion. Kinetics of transport as a function of external Na+ and substrate concentration suggest an ordered binding of Na+ and substrate to the transporter in which binding of Na+ occurs first. Substrate selectivity experiments show that a variety of anions are transported into the cell via NIS. However, perchlorate, the most potent known inhibitor of NIS, is not transported. Measurements of charge movements associated with NIS conformational changes, and substrate-uncoupled Na+-dependent leak currents of NIS have provided insight into the nature of Na+/I− cotransport. Combined data from electrophysiological measurements and freeze fracture electron microscopy suggest that NIS may be multimeric in its functional form. NIS cRNA (50 ng) was microinjected into stage V-VI X. laevis oocytes (2Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar, 3Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and the oocytes were maintained in Barth's solution at 18 °C until used for experiments. Oocytes were superfused with buffers containing (in mm): 100–0 NaCl, 0–100 choline chloride, 2 KCl, 1 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, pH 7.5. Chloride was replaced with gluconate in Cl−-free solutions. For cation selectivity experiments, NaCl was replaced with choline chloride or LiCl at pH 7.5 or choline chloride at pH 5.0 (adjusted with MES). Electrophysiological recordings were done using the two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique at 22 ± 1 °C (4Loo D.D.F. Hazama A. Supplisson S. Turk E. Wright E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5767-5771Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To obtain current/voltage (I/V) or charge/voltage (Q/V) relations, the pulse protocol (pCLAMP, Axon Instruments) consisted of 100-ms voltage steps from a holding potential (V h) of −50 mV to a series of test voltages (V m) from +50 to −150 mV in 20 mV decrements. Currents from three sweeps were averaged, low-pass filtered at 500 Hz, and sampled at 100 ॖs. Uptake of125I− (15 ॖCi/mol; Amersham Corp.) was determined in NIS cRNA-injected oocytes in the presence of 100 mm Na+ and 50 ॖm I−. V h was −90 mV, and substrate-evoked inward currents were recorded for 10 min. Total inward charge movement was determined by integration of the current with time. At the end of the recording period, oocytes were washed with ice-cold choline buffer, solubilized with 107 sodium dodecyl sulfate, and assayed for125I− content. 22Na+(2.5 ॖCi/mol; DuPont) uptake was determined in the presence of 30 mm Na+ (choline, 70 mm) and in the presence or absence of 5 mm anionic substrate. After maximum charge (Q max) measurements (see below), oocytes were fixed as described previously (5Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Images of P (protoplasmic) and E (exoplasmic) fracture faces where enlarged to a final magnification of × 75,000 and intramembrane particles (IMP) from both the P and E fracture faces where counted from known areas of the membrane. Total number of transporters per oocyte was estimated by determining the total area of the oocyte plasma membrane from the total plasma membrane capacitance (5Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and assuming a membrane specific capacitance of 1 microfarads/cm2. The diameter of the P face IMPs was measured directly from the negative using a profile projector (Nikon, model 6c). Substrate-evoked currents were obtained as the difference in steady-state current measured in the absence and presence of substrate and were fitted to, I=ImaxS·[S]n(K0.5S)n+[S]nEquation 1 where I is the evoked current, Imax S is the maximum current, S is the substrate (anion or Na+), K0.5 S is the substrate concentration at half-maximal current, and n is the Hill coefficient. To obtain the presteady-state currents, total currents were fitted to Equation 2, and transporter-mediated transients were determined by subtracting the capacitive and steady-state components, Itotal(t)=ICmexp(−t/τ1)+IPSexp(−t/τ2)+ISSEquation 2 where I total is the total current,I Cm is the initial membrane capacitive current, τ1 is the time constant of I Cm,I PS is the initial presteady-state current, τ2 is the time constant of I PS, and I SS is the steady-state current. Q/V relations were obtained by integration of the presteady-state current with time for various voltages and were fitted to the Boltzmann relation, Q−QhypQmax=11+exp[z(Vm−V0.5)F/RT]Equation 3 where the total charge Q max =Q dep − Q hyp(Q dep and Q hyp representQ at depolarizing and hyperpolarizing limits), zis the apparent valence of the moveable charge,V m is the membrane voltage during the pulse,V 0.5 is the membrane voltage at which half of the total charge has moved, F is Faraday's constant,R is the gas constant, and T is the absolute temperature. Unless otherwise indicated, results obtained from experiments on individual oocytes are presented, but all experiments were repeated on at least three oocytes from different donor frogs. Data fits were performed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments) or Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). Errors are reported as S.E. of the estimate obtained from the fit or as S.E. of the mean obtained from data from several oocytes. Electrogenicity of NIS is shown in Fig.1. Addition of 500 ॖmI− to the bathing medium caused an inward current of ∼400 nA in an oocyte expressing NIS. ClO4− (500 ॖm), a specific blocker of I− transport by the Na+/I− symporter, abolished the I−-evoked inward current. Fig.2 shows typical I/Vrelationships in a NIS-expressing oocyte before (A) and after (B) addition of I− (500 ॖm) to the bath. In the absence of substrate (Fig. 2 A), after the initial fast capacitive transient (τ = 0.5 ms), NIS exhibited slower presteady-state currents that relaxed to a steady state with a time constant of 8–14 ms (see also Fig. 8). Presteady-state currents were apparently abolished by the addition of I− (Fig.2 B). Addition of I− led to a depolarization of the membrane, the magnitude of which depended on the level of NIS expression, and ranged from 5 to 50 mV (not shown).Figure 2Voltage and concentration dependence of I−-induced inward currents. Current traces were obtained from a NIS cRNA-injected oocyte before (A) and after (B) addition of I− (500 ॖm) to the perfusion solution. The pulse protocol is shown. In Athe presteady-state currents associated with NIS are evident (see also Fig. 8). B, addition of I− (500 ॖm) apparently eliminated the presteady-state currents and induced an inward current. Dotted traces show current at the holding potential and emphasize the difference caused by the addition of I−. C, net I−-evoked inward current was taken as the difference between the steady-state current in the presence (1–100 ॖm) and absence of I− and plotted as a function ofV m.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 8Presteady-state currents: charge movement. A, typical current traces of a NIS-expressing oocyte in response to voltage steps from a V h of −50 mV in the absence of substrate. The pulse protocol was as shown in Fig. 2. The current trace for each voltage step was fitted to Equation 2. τ1, the time constant of the membrane capacitive current was ∼0.5 ms for the largest voltage step (100 mV). The dotted line represents zero current at V h. B, carrier-mediated transient currents. The traces in this figure were obtained by subtracting the capacitive and steady-state components (obtained from Equation 2) from the total current (A) and are plotted 1.5 ms after the onset of the voltage step. C, Q/V relation of charge movements. Q was determined by time integration of the carrier-mediated transient currents (B) for the ON (Q ON; •) and OFF (Q OFF; ○) transients. The smooth line is a single Boltzmann fit to the average of Q ON andQ OFF according to Equation 3. Q max = 12 ± 0.6 nanocoulombs,z = 0.9 ± 0.1, V 0.5 = −17 ± 2 mV. D, τ/V relation of the charge transfer. τ was determined from the fit of the total currents in A to Equation 2. τON /V (•) was bell-shaped and the smooth line is a Gaussian fit to τON. τmax was 14 ms, and the voltage at which τmax was observed (V τmax) was −54 ± 2 mV. τOFF was voltage-independent and is shown for +50 mV (○). The time constants of the membrane capacitive currents for the ON (▪) and OFF (□) responses are also shown (∼0.5 ms).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The magnitude of the I−-induced inward current increased with hyperpolarizing potentials, but did not saturate within this voltage range (−150 to −10 mV; Fig. 2 C). Iodide-induced inward current was concentration-dependent and saturable. At each voltage, the net I−-induced current was plotted as a function of [I−] and fitted to Equation 1(n = 1). At −50 mV, the apparent affinity constant of NIS for I−(K 0.5I−) ranged from 15 to 75 ॖm and averaged 33 ± 9 ॖm(N = 7; Fig.3 A). The apparent affinity constant of NIS for iodide (K 0.5I−) was relatively voltage-independent between −150 and −50 mV and increased at potentials more positive than −50 mV (Fig. 3 B). Maximal iodide-induced current (I maxI−) increased in a superlinear fashion as the membrane was driven toward more negative potentials and did not saturate in this voltage range (Fig. 3 C). Fig. 4 shows the relative substrate selectivity of NIS. In this experiment, current was monitored as anions were added (500 ॖm) to the perfusion solution. The best transported substrates were I−, ClO3−, SCN−, SeCN−, and NO3−. SCN− was transported to a significant extent, but ClO4− was not transported at all. The transported anions did not induce an appreciable inward current in H2O-injected oocytes from the same batch (see below). NO2−, HCO3−, acetate, succinate, SO32−, CO32−, S2O32−, and P2O44− were not transported (not shown). The relative apparent affinity of NIS for anions (TableI) were: I− (1.00) ≥ SeCN− (0.87) > SCN− (0.34) > ClO3− (0.12) > NO3− (0.04). The relativeI max values (I maxI− = 1) ranged from 0.8 to 1.5 (Table I). The voltage dependence of K 0.5and I max was the same for all of the above anions (not shown).Table IKinetics of anion cotransportAnionK 0.5I maxॖmI−33 ± 91.00SeCN−38 ± 150.8 ± 0.1SCN−96 ± 90.8 ± 0.2ClO3−277 ± 201.0 ± 0.2NO3−739 ± 2231.5 ± 0.2I maxsubstrate values have been normalized toI maxI− obtained from the same oocyte from which the substrate-induced current was obtained.

Values are mean ± S.E. from at least three oocytes. Reported values are for V m = −50 mV. ClO4− completely blocked the current generated by 50 ॖm I−, with an apparent half-inhibition constant (K i ClO4−) of 1.8 ± 0.4 ॖm (N = 4). K i ReO4−was also very low (3.2 ± 0.4 ॖm; N= 5), but this inhibitor could only block the I−-induced current by 86 ± 37. This could be due to the fact that at high concentrations (500 ॖm), ReO4− itself can induce a very small inward current (Fig. 4). BF4− and IO4− (500 ॖm) reduced the I−-evoked (50 ॖm) inward currents by 74 ± 107 and 21 ± 67, respectively (N = 3). In some control (non-injected) oocytes, I− induced a small but detectable inward current, which was prominent at high iodide concentrations (>500 ॖm) and at depolarizing membrane potentials (−10 to +50 mV). These iodide currents were insensitive to perchlorate. Of the anions that are readily transported by NIS (I−, ClO3−, SCN−, SeCN−, and NO3−), only ClO3− did not exhibit this behavior. Therefore, we chose to use ClO3− as a model anion for further kinetic studies. When Na+ in the perfusion solution was isotonically replaced with choline, no I−-induced (500 ॖm) inward current was observed at either pH 7.5 or 5.0. Li+, however, was able to drive transport at a reduced level. At −150 mV, the Li+/I− current was 10–207 of the Na+/I− current (not shown). In Fig.5 A, inward currents induced by 0.25, 1, and 5 mm ClO3− are plotted as a function of external Na+ concentration ([Na+] o). At each substrate concentration, inward currents saturated with increasing [Na+] o. The Hill coefficient for Na+ was ∼2 regardless of the substrate concentration and V m; at [ClO3−] = 1 mm andV m = −50 mV, n = 2.2 ± 0.1. I maxNa+ increased with increasing substrate concentration (Fig. 5 B) and the apparent affinity of NIS for Na+ increased as [ClO3−] was increased (Fig.5 C). At −50 mV, at [ClO3−] = 0.25, 1, and 5 mm, K 0.5Na+ was 57 ± 7, 39 ± 3, and 28 ± 3 mm, respectively. Examination of substrate kinetics at different [Na+] o (Fig.6 A) showed that althoughI maxClO3−remained constant as [Na+] o was lowered (Fig.6 B), the apparent affinity of NIS for substrate decreased dramatically (Fig. 6 C);K 0.5ClO3−was 271 ± 5 ॖm at 100 mm[Na+] o and 1671 ± 263 ॖm at 20 mm [Na+] o. Fig.7 A shows the voltage-dependence ofK 0.5ClO3−at various [Na+] o. Regardless of [Na+] o,K 0.5ClO3−approached 150 ॖm at hyperpolarizing limits. At less negative membrane potentialsK 0.5ClO3−varied greatly depending on [Na+] o. As withK 0.5ClO3−,K 0.5Na+ varied with voltage and with the concentration of cosubstrate (Fig. 7 B). In the absence of substrate, NIS cRNA-injected oocytes exhibited presteady-state current transients in response to step changes in V m (Figs.2 A and 8 A). These current transients were not observed in control H2O-injected oocytes (see Ref. 3Parent L. Supplisson S. Loo D.D.F. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1992; 125: 49-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Fitting of the current traces (both ON and OFF; Fig.8 A) to Equation 2 resolved three components: (i) a fast component (τ ∼0.5 ms) due to oocyte membrane capacitive currents (also seen in control oocytes); (ii) a second slower component (τ ≈8–14 ms), which was the NIS-mediated current; and (iii) a steady-state current due to 舠leak舡 pathways in NIS and the membrane. To obtain the carrier-mediated transients, the membrane capacitive and steady-state components were subtracted from the total current (Fig. 8 B). At each clamped voltage, integration of the carrier-mediated currents (Fig. 8 B) with time yielded the charge (Q) moved by NIS within the membrane electric field. Fig. 8 C shows a Q/V relationship for NIS. Q ON and Q OFFwere equal and opposite in sign and reversed atV h (−50 mV). The Q/V curve fitted a single Boltzmann relation (Equation 3) with aV 0.5 of −15 ± 3 mV and a z of 0.9 ± 0.1 (N = 8). The time constant of the slow current transient was voltage-dependent for the ON response. τON /V was bell-shaped and ranged from 8 to 14 ms with its maximum value at ∼−55 mV (V τmax) (Fig. 8 D). τOFF was voltage-independent at ∼10 ms (○; Fig.8 D). Fig. 9 A shows Q/Vcurves at 0–100 mm [Na+] o. There was no loss in Q max as [Na+] o was reduced from 100–20 mm (Fig. 9 B), butV 0.5 shifted from −17 mV at 100 mm[Na+] o to −90 mV at 20 mm[Na+] o (Fig. 9 C). z was ∼1 at all Na+ concentrations. The maximum value of the time constant of the relaxation currents (τmax ≈14 ms) did not change as [Na+] o was reduced (not shown), but V τmax shifted from ∼−55 mV at 100 mm [Na+] o to ∼−74 mV at 20 mm [Na+] o (not shown). Addition of either substrate or inhibitor led to a reduction inQ max (Fig.10 A). As the concentration of substrate or inhibitor was increased, the decrease inQ max followed a hyperbolic function (not shown). With ClO3−, 50 percent reduction inQ max was reached at 586 ± 80 ॖm (N = 3). The ClO3−-induced reduction inQ max was directly proportional to the steady-state ClO3−-induced inward current (Fig. 10 B). At −50 and −150 mV, the slope of the plot I versus Q was 36 ± 2 s−1 and 61 ± 4 s−1, respectively. In NIS-expressing oocytes, replacement of 100 mm choline chloride with NaCl caused an inward current that was much larger (>100 nA; Fig.11 A) than that seen in H2O-injected oocytes (<20 nA at −50 mV). Addition of 500 ॖm I− caused a further increase in the inward current. The Na+-dependent inward current, in the absence of substrate, is referred to as the NIS Na+ leak current. The Na+ leak current was saturable with increasing [Na+] o. At −50 mV, the [Na+] o at which the leak current was half-maximal ( K0.5leak) was 74 ± 14 mm (N = 3; Fig. 11 B), and the Hill coefficient was 0.9 ± 0.1 (N = 3). Control H2O-injected oocytes exhibited inward Na+currents that had a half-saturation constant of 9 ± 2 mm (N = 3). The magnitude of the leak current increased linearly with the level of expression, such that there was a direct linear correlation between the leak current and the substrate-induced current. At −150 mV, the plot of maximum leak current as a function of maximum ClO3−-induced current ( Imaxleak versus I maxClO−3) yielded a slope of 0.34 ± 0.04 (N = 7; not shown). Fig.12 A shows a current record from a NIS-expressing oocyte held at −90 mV and perfused with a solution containing I− (100 mmNa+, 50 ॖm I−, and 15 ॖCi/mol125I−) for 10 min. Integration of the I−-evoked inward current yielded the net positive charge that entered the oocyte during the recording period (shaded region). In the same oocyte, I− uptake was measured by determination of 125I− content. A plot of the net inward charge versus I− uptake from 10 oocytes revealed a linear relation with a slope of 0.76 ± 0.03 inward charge per iodide uptake (Fig. 12 B). In Fig.12 C, inward charge is plotted as a function of Na+ uptake. Inward current was induced by 5 mmClO3− for 10 min in the presence of 30 mm Na+ and 2.5 ॖCi/mol22Na+. The slope of the line was 0.42 ± 0.04 inward charge per Na+ uptake (N = 6). Freeze-fracture electron micrographs of the P fracture face from the plasma membrane of a control H2O-injected oocyte and an oocyte expressing NIS are shown in Fig. 13. In the control oocyte, the density of IMPs in the P face was 356 ± 69/ॖm2 (mean ± S.D.; Fig. 13 A). The endogenous intramembrane particles showed a relatively homogenous distribution with a mean diameter of 7.6 ± 1.2 nm (N = 875). Oocytes expressing NIS showed a ∼2.5-fold increase in the density of P face particles to 887 ± 146/ॖm2 (Fig. 13 B). In contrast, the density of IMPs in the E face was not altered by expression of NIS (not shown; see Ref. 5Zampighi G.A. Kreman M. Boorer K.J. Loo D.D.F. Bezanilla F. Chandy G. Hall J.E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1995; 148: 65-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In addition, P face intramembrane particles of NIS-expressing oocytes showed a greater heterogeneity in size. Analysis of the diameter of P face IMPs (N = 856) in oocytes expressing NIS showed two prominent populations: one at 7.2 ± 0.5 nm corresponding to the endogenous particles and another at 9.0 ± 0.6 nm due to NIS particles. In the oocyte in Fig. 13 B,Q max was 18 nanocoulombs and the total number of transporters (N NIS) in the plasma membrane was 3.5 × 1010. Q max =N NIS Ze, where Z is the valence of the moveable charge per NIS particle, and e is the electronic charge. Therefore, Z was estimated to be ∼3 electronic charges. Cloning of the Na+/I− symporter and its expression inX. laevis oocytes has made it possible to carry out a thorough functional characterization of this transporter. Iodide transport via NIS generates a net influx of positive charge (an inward current) that depolarizes the membrane. The inward current is Na+-dependent, stimulated by I−, and coupled to Na+ and I− influx. Uptake studies indicate that 2 Na+ ions are transported with one anion, resulting in inward movement of one positive charge. Previously, the electrogenic nature of the Na+/I−symporter had been suggested in experiments using plasma membrane vesicles from hog thyroid (6O'Neill B. Magnolato D. Semenza G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 896: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The apparent affinity constant of NIS for I− (33 ± 9 ॖm at −50 mV) is in general agreement with those obtained in uptake studies in NIS-expressing X. laevisoocytes (36 ॖm) (2Dai G. Levy O. Carrasco N. Nature. 1996; 379: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar), FRTL-5 cells (30 ॖm) (7Weiss S.J. Philp N.J. Grollman E.F. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 1108-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and membrane vesicles derived form porcine thyroid (5 ॖm) (6O'Neill B. Magnolato D. Semenza G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 896: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 8Nakamura Y. Ohtaki S. Yamazaki I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 544-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is significant to note that the reported free iodide concentration in the mammalian plasma is 50–300 nm (1Carrasco N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), while theK 0.5I− determined in this and other studies is in the low micromolar range. The apparent affinity constant of NIS for Na+ (28 ± 3 mm at −50 mV and saturating substrate) is also comparable with that found in other studies (∼50 mm) (6O'Neill B. Magnolato D. Semenza G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 896: 263-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Kaminsky S.M. Levy O. Garry M.T. Carrasco N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In addition to I−, a number of other anions are transported by NIS: I− ≥ SeCN− > SCN− > ClO3− > NO3−. The only apparent common denominator for the well transported substrates is anionic monovalency. The closer the size of the monovalent anion to that of I−, the better it is transported (10Halmi N.S. Vitam. Horm. 1961; 19: 133-163Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). No conclusion, however, can be drawn regarding the molecular geometry of a good substrate. Iodide is nearly spherical while SeCN− and SCN− are near-linear; ClO3− has a trigonal pyramidal geometry; and NO3− is planar. Regardless of the geometry of the anion, the qualitative similarity of transport kinetics of I−, SeCN−, SCN−, ClO3−, and NO3− suggests that their mechanism of transport may be the same. A number of anions can significantly inhibit I− transport. Most notable is ClO4−, the most potent known inhibitor of NIS (K i ClO4−= 1.8 ± 0.4 ॖm). Previous reports suggested that ReO4− (perrhenate) is transported into the thyroid (10Halmi N.S. Vitam. Horm. 1961; 19: 133-163Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our results show that ReO4− is also a very potent blocker (K i ReO4−= 3.2 ± 0.4 ॖm), but at high concentrations (>500 ॖm) it is transported via NIS to a very small extent (Fig. 4). ClO4− and SCN−were traditionally used as competitive inhibitors of I−uptake in the thyroid gland, and both were believed to be transported via the Na+/I− cotransport system (1Carrasco N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 11Anbar M. Guttmann S. Lewitus Z. J. Appl. Radiat. Isot. 1959; 7: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In our system, SCN− is transported, but perchlorate is not. That perchlorate is not transported by NIS is not unique to theXenopus oocyte expression system as similar results have been obtained with rat NIS expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (12Yoshida A. Sasaki N. Mori A. Taniguchi S. Mitani Y. Ueta Y. Hattori K. Sato R. Hisatome I. Mori T. Shigemasa C. Kosugi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 231: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our data, however, cannot exclude electroneutral Na+/ClO4− transport (1:1 coupling ratio). Thus, anions that effectively interact with NIS can be subdivided into three groups: (i) anions that are readily transported; e.g.I−, SeCN−, SCN−, ClO3−, and NO3−; (ii) anions that partially inhibit I− transport, but are themselves transported to some extent; e.g. IO4−, BF4−, and ReO4−; and (iii) anions that completely inhibit transport; ClO4−. Although no conclusion can be drawn about the molecular commonality of the first group, anions belonging to the second and third groups all have a tetrahedral molecular geometry with an anionic volume very similar to that of I− (13Wolf J.

MEIS1 is able to rescue hth mutant phenotypes and can induce the cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of EXD in cell culture and Drosophila embryos. Thus, Meis1 is a murine homolog of hth. MEIS1/HTH also specifically binds to EXD with high affinity in vitro. These data suggest a novel and evolutionarily conserved mechanism for regulating HOX activity in which a direct protein-protein interaction between EXD and HTH results in EXD's nuclear translocation."

There are three distinct PPARs, termed α, δ (also called ॆ, NUC-1), and γ, each encoded by a separate gene and showing a distinct tissue distribution (for review, see Refs. 1Desvergne B. Wahli W.

Activated PPARs heterodimerize with another nuclear receptor, RXR and alter transcription of target genes after binding to specific response elements or PPREs. PPREs consist of a direct repeat of the nuclear receptor hexameric DNA recognition motif spaced by one nucleotide. Numerous PPAR target genes have been identified (for review, see Ref. 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Since they are activated by various fatty acid metabolites as well as several drugs used in the treatment of metabolic disorders, PPARs can be considered as key messengers that modulate nutritional, pharmacological, and metabolic stimuli into changes in gene expression. PPARs were initially considered orphan receptors, since no direct binding of the various activators to the receptors could be demonstrated. However, PPARα has recently been shown to bind and be activated by leukotriene B4 and fibrates (6Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). In addition, prostaglandin J2 derivatives and the antidiabetic thiazolidinediones have been shown to be natural and synthetic ligands for PPARγ, respectively (7Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J.

Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar), and it is expressed primarily in tissues that have a high level of fatty acid catabolism such as liver (11Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1995; 137: 354-366Crossref Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). In the liver, PPARα modulates oxidation of fatty acids and detoxification of several xenobiotic compounds. Numerous studies have demonstrated that several genes encoding enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as ॆ- and ω-oxidation, contain a PPRE in their promoter region and are under transcriptional control of PPARα (reviewed in Ref. 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, PPARα knockout mice, which are apparently healthy under basal conditions, are not able to induce genes involved in ॆ- and ω-oxidation when treated with compounds that activate PPARα (12Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Fatty acid oxidation pathways have diverse roles in physiology, extending from a role in lipid metabolism strictu sensu to a role in the metabolism of various lipid mediators and signaling factors (6Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar).In addition to its role in ω- and ॆ-oxidation pathways, PPARα was suggested to be important in the control of extracellular lipid metabolism (for review, see Refs. 1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Bauerle P. Inducible Gene Expression. Boston Birkhauser, Cambridge, MA1994: 142-176Google Scholar, 2Green S. Mutat.

Lipidol. 1997; 8: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). For example, PPARα activators such as fibrates have an important role in the control of HDL cholesterol levels. Gene expression of apoA-I and apoA-II, the major apolipoproteins in HDL, is controlled by PPARα. Thus, these protagonists of reverse cholesterol transport (13Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a protective pathway against coronary artery disease (14Miller N.E. Am. Heart J. 1987; 112: 825-836Google Scholar), can be modulated by PPARα (reviewed in Refs. 3Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys.

Besides the role of PPARs in HDL metabolism, they also affect metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles (reviewed in Refs. 3Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys.

In fact, activation of either PPARα and/or PPARγ has pronounced triglyceride-lowering effects in animals and man due to effects on both clearance and production rates of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.Given the effects of treatment with PPARα activators on lipoprotein metabolism, the goal of this study was to analyze in a more direct fashion whether PPARα is involved in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism. Thus, we examined lipoprotein metabolism in PPARα-deficient mice. These data unequivocally demonstrate that PPARα has an important regulatory role in lipid metabolism.DISCUSSIONSince peroxisome proliferators induce altered expression of genes encoding peroxisomal ॆ-oxidation enzymes, microsomal ω-oxidation enzymes, and apolipoproteins, a role in lipid homeostasis for these compounds can be hypothesized. This idea is further supported by the known triglyceride-lowering effects of fibrates, a commonly used class of hypolipidemic agents. Recently it was shown that several peroxisome proliferators including fibrates and a fatty acid derivative are capable of activating PPARα. To better delineate a role for PPARα in lipid homeostasis, we examined lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in PPARα-deficient mice.Serum lipid and lipoprotein parameters were markedly altered in PPARα (−/−) mice compared with PPARα (+/+) mice. Most striking was the consistent increase in total and HDL cholesterol levels in the PPARα (−/−) mice. This increase in HDL cholesterol levels was associated with a parallel elevation in serum apoA-I levels, which was associated with higher levels of hepatic apoA-I mRNA levels. Despite the higher level of serum HDL cholesterol, the composition and the size distribution of HDL particles was not different between the two genotypes. This suggests that the increase in serum HDL cholesterol in the PPARα (−/−) mice was essentially due to an increase in the amount of circulating HDL lipoproteins. Another strong argument supporting an active role of PPARα in the control of HDL metabolism was provided by the absence of a similar regulatory effect of fibrate lipid-lowering drugs on liver apoA-I and apoA-II mRNA and serum apoA-I and apoA-II levels in PPARα (−/−) animals. In fact, apoA-I mRNA levels were, as reported previously (20Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouët S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.-C. Rubin E. Denèfle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), decreased after fibrate treatment in PPARα (+/+) animals, whereas no regulation was observed in the (−/−) mice. Similar to previous work in humans (27Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.-C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), apoA-II mRNA and serum levels were only increased by fibrates in PPARα (+/+), but not in (−/−) mice. Combined, these observations clearly establish PPARα as a key regulatory factor in HDL metabolism.The pathways through which PPARα and its activators/ligands alter apolipoprotein expression and HDL metabolism is an active area of research. There is some confusion in this area that stems from differences between human and rodent apoA-I gene regulation by fibrates. In rats, serum HDL cholesterol and hepatic apoA-I mRNA levels are typically down-regulated by fibrates (20Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouët S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.-C. Rubin E. Denèfle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin.

Atherosclerosis. 1987; 63: 57-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which fibrates exert an overall negative effect on the minimal promoter of the mouse apoA-I gene are as of yet not defined.The present results, which demonstrate an increase in liver apoA-I mRNA levels under basal conditions in PPARα (−/−) mice and show no regulatory effect of fibrates in these mice, are consistent with a negative regulatory effect of PPAR activators on rodent apoA-I expression (20Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouët S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.-C. Rubin E. Denèfle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This indicates that PPARα is one of the key players in determining liver apoA-I expression.Human liver apoA-II expression is stimulated by PPARα. In fact, PPAR induces apoA-II expression through interaction with a PPRE located in the apoA-II J site (27Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.-C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The absence in PPARα (−/−) mice of increased apoA-II mRNA and serum levels, typically observed in PPARα (+/+) mice after fibrate treatment, indicates that regulatory mechanisms similar to those for the human apoA-II gene must exist in mice. The regulatory function of PPARα on gene expression of these two major HDL apolipoproteins may have important clinical implications in man. Since apoA-I and apoA-II are major determinants of HDL metabolism, alterations in their gene expression could significantly affect reverse cholesterol transport pathway, which seems to protect against coronary atherosclerosis.PPARα (+/+) mice fed the 0.17 Wy 14,643 diet have significantly lower hepatic apoC-III mRNA levels and triglyceride concentration compared with control untreated (+/+) mice. This is consistent with previous reports showing a similar reduction in apoC-III levels in rats after treatment with hypolipidemic fibrates (21Staels B. Vu-Dac N. Kosykh V. Saladin R. Fruchart J.C.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast, PPARα (−/−) mice fed Wy 14,643 did not exhibit the prototypical response to a peroxisome proliferator since hepatic apoC-III mRNA and triglyceride levels were not different compared with control (+/+) mice. These observations demonstrate that Wy 14,643-induced reductions in hepatic apoC-III mRNA and triglyceride metabolism are mediated by PPARα and hence establish a role for PPARα in the control of VLDL and triglyceride metabolism in addition to its role in HDL metabolism described above.Our observations are also consistent with previous studies, which suggested that activation of PPARα results in lower serum triglyceride levels in animals and man. Steady state triglyceride levels are dependent on two pathways, endogenous synthesis and tissue clearance. Production of triglycerides in the liver is controlled in large part by substrate (fatty acids) availability, whereas tissue clearance of triglycerides is dependent on lipoprotein lipase activity and apolipoprotein C-III. Fibrates can affect both of these processes (reviewed in Ref. 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). For example, fibrates have been shown to stimulate lipolysis and clearance of triglycerides due to decreased transcription and production of apoC-III (21Staels B. Vu-Dac N. Kosykh V. Saladin R.

The effect of peroxisome proliferators on apoC-III expression may involve competition by PPAR for binding to a cis-acting sequence on the apoC-III promoter as well as a direct repression of hepatic nuclear factor-4 expression (25Hertz R.

In addition to apoC-III-mediated effects on the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins induced by PPARα, this receptor also influences production rates of these particles. Fibrate activation of PPARα in the liver stimulates fatty acid uptake and conversion to acyl-CoA derivatives by the induction of the genes coding for the fatty acid transporter protein 2Martin, G., Schoonjans, K., Lefebvre, A., Staels, B., and Auwerx, J.

The resulting acyl-CoA derivatives in hepatocytes are then more efficiently oxidized by induction of fatty acid ॆ-oxidation pathways in peroxisomes and mitochondria (see above). Besides modulating ॆ-oxidation of fatty acids, PPARα activation can also inhibitde novo fatty acid synthesis that contributes to decreased triglyceride synthesis and VLDL production (reviewed in Ref. 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Hence, both enhanced catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles as well as reduced secretion of VLDL particles are mechanisms that contribute to the hypolipidemic effect of PPARα activation.Our results clearly show that PPARα modulates lipid metabolism in a homeostatic mechanism since mice lacking functional PPARα have higher levels of serum HDL. In addition, PPARα has an important role in mediating the effects of fibrates on apolipoprotein, HDL, and triglyceride metabolism. Our observations in the PPARα-deficient mouse warrant further studies to delineate the role of normal and abnormal PPAR activity in man. It may be especially interesting to evaluate genetic linkage in the PPARα gene from patients with abnormalities in lipid metabolism such as hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or combined hyperlipidemia. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator-response element; HDL, high density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein. 1The abbreviations used are: PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; PPRE, peroxisome proliferator-response element; HDL, high density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein. are a subfamily of the nuclear hormone receptor gene family. There are three distinct PPARs, termed α, δ (also called ॆ, NUC-1), and γ, each encoded by a separate gene and showing a distinct tissue distribution (for review, see Refs. 1Desvergne B. Wahli W.

Activated PPARs heterodimerize with another nuclear receptor, RXR and alter transcription of target genes after binding to specific response elements or PPREs. PPREs consist of a direct repeat of the nuclear receptor hexameric DNA recognition motif spaced by one nucleotide. Numerous PPAR target genes have been identified (for review, see Ref. 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Since they are activated by various fatty acid metabolites as well as several drugs used in the treatment of metabolic disorders, PPARs can be considered as key messengers that modulate nutritional, pharmacological, and metabolic stimuli into changes in gene expression. PPARs were initially considered orphan receptors, since no direct binding of the various activators to the receptors could be demonstrated. However, PPARα has recently been shown to bind and be activated by leukotriene B4 and fibrates (6Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). In addition, prostaglandin J2 derivatives and the antidiabetic thiazolidinediones have been shown to be natural and synthetic ligands for PPARγ, respectively (7Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 12953-12956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3443) Google Scholar). PPARα was the first PPAR to be identified (10Isseman I. Green S. Nature. 1990; 347: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (3019) Google Scholar), and it is expressed primarily in tissues that have a high level of fatty acid catabolism such as liver (11Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1995; 137: 354-366Crossref Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). In the liver, PPARα modulates oxidation of fatty acids and detoxification of several xenobiotic compounds. Numerous studies have demonstrated that several genes encoding enzymes involved in metabolic pathways, such as ॆ- and ω-oxidation, contain a PPRE in their promoter region and are under transcriptional control of PPARα (reviewed in Ref. 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, PPARα knockout mice, which are apparently healthy under basal conditions, are not able to induce genes involved in ॆ- and ω-oxidation when treated with compounds that activate PPARα (12Lee S.S.T. Pineau T. Drago J. Lee E.J. Owens J.W. Kroetz D.L. Fernandez-Salguero P.M. Westphal H. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3012-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar). Fatty acid oxidation pathways have diverse roles in physiology, extending from a role in lipid metabolism strictu sensu to a role in the metabolism of various lipid mediators and signaling factors (6Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in ω- and ॆ-oxidation pathways, PPARα was suggested to be important in the control of extracellular lipid metabolism (for review, see Refs. 1Desvergne B. Wahli W. Bauerle P. Inducible Gene Expression. Boston Birkhauser, Cambridge, MA1994: 142-176Google Scholar, 2Green S. Mutat. Res. 1995; 333: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 3Schoonjans K. Staels B.

For example, PPARα activators such as fibrates have an important role in the control of HDL cholesterol levels. Gene expression of apoA-I and apoA-II, the major apolipoproteins in HDL, is controlled by PPARα. Thus, these protagonists of reverse cholesterol transport (13Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 211-228Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a protective pathway against coronary artery disease (14Miller N.E. Am. Heart J. 1987; 112: 825-836Google Scholar), can be modulated by PPARα (reviewed in Refs. 3Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys.

Besides the role of PPARs in HDL metabolism, they also affect metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles (reviewed in Refs. 3Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 907-925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys.

In fact, activation of either PPARα and/or PPARγ has pronounced triglyceride-lowering effects in animals and man due to effects on both clearance and production rates of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Given the effects of treatment with PPARα activators on lipoprotein metabolism, the goal of this study was to analyze in a more direct fashion whether PPARα is involved in the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism. Thus, we examined lipoprotein metabolism in PPARα-deficient mice. These data unequivocally demonstrate that PPARα has an important regulatory role in lipid metabolism. DISCUSSIONSince peroxisome proliferators induce altered expression of genes encoding peroxisomal ॆ-oxidation enzymes, microsomal ω-oxidation enzymes, and apolipoproteins, a role in lipid homeostasis for these compounds can be hypothesized. This idea is further supported by the known triglyceride-lowering effects of fibrates, a commonly used class of hypolipidemic agents. Recently it was shown that several peroxisome proliferators including fibrates and a fatty acid derivative are capable of activating PPARα. To better delineate a role for PPARα in lipid homeostasis, we examined lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in PPARα-deficient mice.Serum lipid and lipoprotein parameters were markedly altered in PPARα (−/−) mice compared with PPARα (+/+) mice. Most striking was the consistent increase in total and HDL cholesterol levels in the PPARα (−/−) mice. This increase in HDL cholesterol levels was associated with a parallel elevation in serum apoA-I levels, which was associated with higher levels of hepatic apoA-I mRNA levels. Despite the higher level of serum HDL cholesterol, the composition and the size distribution of HDL particles was not different between the two genotypes. This suggests that the increase in serum HDL cholesterol in the PPARα (−/−) mice was essentially due to an increase in the amount of circulating HDL lipoproteins. Another strong argument supporting an active role of PPARα in the control of HDL metabolism was provided by the absence of a similar regulatory effect of fibrate lipid-lowering drugs on liver apoA-I and apoA-II mRNA and serum apoA-I and apoA-II levels in PPARα (−/−) animals. In fact, apoA-I mRNA levels were, as reported previously (20Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouët S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.-C. Rubin E. Denèfle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar), decreased after fibrate treatment in PPARα (+/+) animals, whereas no regulation was observed in the (−/−) mice. Similar to previous work in humans (27Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.-C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), apoA-II mRNA and serum levels were only increased by fibrates in PPARα (+/+), but not in (−/−) mice. Combined, these observations clearly establish PPARα as a key regulatory factor in HDL metabolism.The pathways through which PPARα and its activators/ligands alter apolipoprotein expression and HDL metabolism is an active area of research. There is some confusion in this area that stems from differences between human and rodent apoA-I gene regulation by fibrates. In rats, serum HDL cholesterol and hepatic apoA-I mRNA levels are typically down-regulated by fibrates (20Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouët S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.-C. Rubin E. Denèfle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin.

Atherosclerosis. 1987; 63: 57-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which fibrates exert an overall negative effect on the minimal promoter of the mouse apoA-I gene are as of yet not defined.The present results, which demonstrate an increase in liver apoA-I mRNA levels under basal conditions in PPARα (−/−) mice and show no regulatory effect of fibrates in these mice, are consistent with a negative regulatory effect of PPAR activators on rodent apoA-I expression (20Staels B. Van Tol A. Andreu T. Auwerx J. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1992; 12: 286-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Berthou L. Duverger N. Emmanuel F. Langouët S. Auwerx J. Guillouzo A. Fruchart J.-C. Rubin E. Denèfle P. Staels B. Branellec D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2408-2416Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). This indicates that PPARα is one of the key players in determining liver apoA-I expression.Human liver apoA-II expression is stimulated by PPARα. In fact, PPAR induces apoA-II expression through interaction with a PPRE located in the apoA-II J site (27Vu-Dac N. Schoonjans K. Kosykh V. Dallongeville J. Fruchart J.-C. Staels B. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). The absence in PPARα (−/−) mice of increased apoA-II mRNA and serum levels, typically observed in PPARα (+/+) mice after fibrate treatment, indicates that regulatory mechanisms similar to those for the human apoA-II gene must exist in mice. The regulatory function of PPARα on gene expression of these two major HDL apolipoproteins may have important clinical implications in man. Since apoA-I and apoA-II are major determinants of HDL metabolism, alterations in their gene expression could significantly affect reverse cholesterol transport pathway, which seems to protect against coronary atherosclerosis.PPARα (+/+) mice fed the 0.17 Wy 14,643 diet have significantly lower hepatic apoC-III mRNA levels and triglyceride concentration compared with control untreated (+/+) mice. This is consistent with previous reports showing a similar reduction in apoC-III levels in rats after treatment with hypolipidemic fibrates (21Staels B. Vu-Dac N. Kosykh V. Saladin R. Fruchart J.C. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 705-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Haubenwallner S. Essenburg A.D. Barnett B.C. Pape M.E. DeMattos R.B. Krause B.R. Minton L.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In contrast, PPARα (−/−) mice fed Wy 14,643 did not exhibit the prototypical response to a peroxisome proliferator since hepatic apoC-III mRNA and triglyceride levels were not different compared with control (+/+) mice. These observations demonstrate that Wy 14,643-induced reductions in hepatic apoC-III mRNA and triglyceride metabolism are mediated by PPARα and hence establish a role for PPARα in the control of VLDL and triglyceride metabolism in addition to its role in HDL metabolism described above.Our observations are also consistent with previous studies, which suggested that activation of PPARα results in lower serum triglyceride levels in animals and man. Steady state triglyceride levels are dependent on two pathways, endogenous synthesis and tissue clearance. Production of triglycerides in the liver is controlled in large part by substrate (fatty acids) availability, whereas tissue clearance of triglycerides is dependent on lipoprotein lipase activity and apolipoprotein C-III. Fibrates can affect both of these processes (reviewed in Ref. 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). For example, fibrates have been shown to stimulate lipolysis and clearance of triglycerides due to decreased transcription and production of apoC-III (21Staels B. Vu-Dac N. Kosykh V. Saladin R. Fruchart J.C. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 705-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Haubenwallner S. Essenburg A.D. Barnett B.C. Pape M.E. DeMattos R.B. Krause B.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), an apolipoprotein that limits tissue clearance of triglyceride. The effect of peroxisome proliferators on apoC-III expression may involve competition by PPAR for binding to a cis-acting sequence on the apoC-III promoter as well as a direct repression of hepatic nuclear factor-4 expression (25Hertz R. Bishara-Shieban J. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In addition to apoC-III-mediated effects on the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins induced by PPARα, this receptor also influences production rates of these particles. Fibrate activation of PPARα in the liver stimulates fatty acid uptake and conversion to acyl-CoA derivatives by the induction of the genes coding for the fatty acid transporter protein 2Martin, G., Schoonjans, K., Lefebvre, A., Staels, B., and Auwerx, J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., manuscript in press. and acyl-CoA synthase (31Schoonjans K. Staels B. Grimaldi P. Auwerx J. Eur. J.

In contrast, PPARα (−/−) mice fed Wy 14,643 did not exhibit the prototypical response to a peroxisome proliferator since hepatic apoC-III mRNA and triglyceride levels were not different compared with control (+/+) mice. These observations demonstrate that Wy 14,643-induced reductions in hepatic apoC-III mRNA and triglyceride metabolism are mediated by PPARα and hence establish a role for PPARα in the control of VLDL and triglyceride metabolism in addition to its role in HDL metabolism described above. Our observations are also consistent with previous studies, which suggested that activation of PPARα results in lower serum triglyceride levels in animals and man. Steady state triglyceride levels are dependent on two pathways, endogenous synthesis and tissue clearance. Production of triglycerides in the liver is controlled in large part by substrate (fatty acids) availability, whereas tissue clearance of triglycerides is dependent on lipoprotein lipase activity and apolipoprotein C-III. Fibrates can affect both of these processes (reviewed in Ref. 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). For example, fibrates have been shown to stimulate lipolysis and clearance of triglycerides due to decreased transcription and production of apoC-III (21Staels B. Vu-Dac N. Kosykh V. Saladin R. Fruchart J.C. Dallongeville J. Auwerx J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 705-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Haubenwallner S. Essenburg A.D. Barnett B.C. Pape M.E. DeMattos R.B. Krause B.R.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar), an apolipoprotein that limits tissue clearance of triglyceride. The effect of peroxisome proliferators on apoC-III expression may involve competition by PPAR for binding to a cis-acting sequence on the apoC-III promoter as well as a direct repression of hepatic nuclear factor-4 expression (25Hertz R. Bishara-Shieban J. Bar-Tana J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13470-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In addition to apoC-III-mediated effects on the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins induced by PPARα, this receptor also influences production rates of these particles. Fibrate activation of PPARα in the liver stimulates fatty acid uptake and conversion to acyl-CoA derivatives by the induction of the genes coding for the fatty acid transporter protein 2Martin, G., Schoonjans, K., Lefebvre, A., Staels, B., and Auwerx, J. (1997) J. Biol. Chem., manuscript in press. and acyl-CoA synthase (31Schoonjans K. Staels B. Grimaldi P. Auwerx J. Eur. J.

The resulting acyl-CoA derivatives in hepatocytes are then more efficiently oxidized by induction of fatty acid ॆ-oxidation pathways in peroxisomes and mitochondria (see above). Besides modulating ॆ-oxidation of fatty acids, PPARα activation can also inhibitde novo fatty acid synthesis that contributes to decreased triglyceride synthesis and VLDL production (reviewed in Ref. 4Schoonjans K. Staels B. Auwerx J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1302: 93-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Hence, both enhanced catabolism of triglyceride-rich particles as well as reduced secretion of VLDL particles are mechanisms that contribute to the hypolipidemic effect of PPARα activation. Our results clearly show that PPARα modulates lipid metabolism in a homeostatic mechanism since mice lacking functional PPARα have higher levels of serum HDL. In addition, PPARα has an important role in mediating the effects of fibrates on apolipoprotein, HDL, and triglyceride metabolism. Our observations in the PPARα-deficient mouse warrant further studies to delineate the role of normal and abnormal PPAR activity in man. It may be especially interesting to evaluate genetic linkage in the PPARα gene from patients with abnormalities in lipid metabolism such as hypoalphalipoproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, or combined hyperlipidemia.

Antibodies to this protein and a recombinant form of it block cisternal stacking in a cell-free system, justifying its designation as a Golgi ReAssembly Stacking Protein (GRASP65). One of the two minor targets of NEM is GM130, previously implicated in the docking of transport vesicles and mitotic fragmentation of the Golgi stack. GRASP65 is complexed with GM130 and is tightly bound to Golgi membranes, even under mitotic conditions when both are heavily phosphorylated. These results link vesicle docking, stacking of Golgi cisternae, and the disruption of both of these interactions during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2113585283,"Different olfactory cues elicit distinct behaviors such as attraction, avoidance, feeding, or mating. In the nematode C. elegans, these cues are sensed by a small number of olfactory neurons, each of which expresses several different odorant receptors. The type of behavioral response elicited by an odorant could be specified by the olfactory receptor or by the olfactory neuron in which the receptor is activated. The attractive odorant diacetyl is detected by the receptor protein ODR-10, which is normally expressed in the AWA olfactory neurons. The repulsive odorant 2-nonanone is detected by the AWB olfactory neurons. Transgenic animals that express ODR-10 in AWB rather than AWA avoid diacetyl, while maintaining qualitatively normal responses to other attractive and repulsive odorants. Animals that express ODR-10 simultaneously in AWA and AWB have a defective response to diacetyl, possibly because of conflicting olfactory inputs. Thus, an animal's preference for an odor is defined by the sensory neurons that express a given odorant receptor molecule."

Monoglyceride lipase was cloned from a mouse adipocyte cDNA library. The predicted amino acid sequence consisted of 302 amino acids, corresponding to a molecular weight of 33,218. The sequence showed no extensive homology to other known mammalian proteins, but a number of microbial proteins, including two bacterial lysophospholipases and a family of haloperoxidases, were found to be distantly related to this enzyme. By means of multiple sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction, the structural elements in monoglyceride lipase, as well as the putative catalytic triad, were identified. The residues of the proposed triad, Ser-122, in a GXSXG motif, Asp-239, and His-269, were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Northern blot analysis revealed that monoglyceride lipase is ubiquitously expressed among tissues, with a transcript size of about 4 kilobases."

FTI-277 accumulated Calu-1 and A-549 lung carcinoma and Colo 357 pancreatic carcinoma cells in G2/M, T-24 bladder carcinoma, and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells in G0/G1, but had no effect on cell cycle distribution of pancreatic (Panc-1), breast (SKBr 3 and MDAMB-231), and head and neck (A-253) carcinoma cells. Furthermore, treatment of Calu-1, Panc-1, Colo 357, T-24, A-253, SKBr 3, and MDAMB-231 cells with GGTI-298, but not FTI-277, induced the protein expression levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF.

It is generally assumed that GGTase-I inhibitors would exert a gross toxic effect because the number of geranylgeranylated proteins in the cell exceeds that of farnesylated proteins by about a factor of 5 (15Casey P.J.

Recent reports from our group have suggested, however, that GGTI-298, a CAAX peptidomimetic GGTase-I inhibitor, may not be simply toxic (9Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M.

For example, we showed that GGTI-298 arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, induced apoptosis, and enhanced nitric-oxide synthase-2 induction by IL-1ॆ. In this report we extended our studies to investigate the effects of GGTI-298 and the FTase specific inhibitor FTI-277 on cell cycle events that may contribute to their growth arrest activity. Very early, it was suggested by Pardee (17Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 1286-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (1061) Google Scholar) that, at various stages of the cell cycle, so-called 舠checkpoints舡 existed whose function was to ensure that cell growth occurred only if a number of minimum requirements were met. Today, it is widely accepted that the cell cycle has several such 舠checkpoints舡 which receive signals from a variety of processes to ensure that a cell replicates only if its genetic code is intact and functional and only if the cell is metabolically prepared for the next phase of the cell cycle. The restriction point in G1 has become the subject of intense research efforts, and some of the processes regulating the G1 to S transition are now beginning to be understood (for a review, see Ref. 18Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2590) Google Scholar). In a G1 arrested cell, transcriptional activity is low due to a major transcriptional activator, E2F, being bound to and inactivated by the hypophosphorylated form of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Upon phosphorylation through cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), Rb dissociates from E2F, resulting in an increase in transcriptional activity mediated by free E2F (reviewed in Ref. 19Hinds P.W. Weinberg R.A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). CDKs have been found to be the catalytic subunits in complexes containing a CDK and a cyclin as the regulatory subunit. The activity of cyclin/CDK complexes is regulated by varying expression levels of the cyclins, whereas CDK levels remain fairly constant throughout the cell cycle (reviewed in Ref. 20Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar). More recently, it was shown that cyclin/CDK activity is also regulated through a number of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. The first such inhibitor was p21WAF, which was described by four independent research groups to be a universal inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (21Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3176) Google Scholar, 22Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J.

Research on the role of the tumor suppressor p53 as a mediator of G1 arrest in response to DNA damage led to the discovery that p21WAF is a downstream effector of p53 (25Dulic V. Kaufmann W.K. Wilson S.J. Tisty T.D. Lees E. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Reed S.I. Cell. 1994; 76: 1013-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). It was also shown that the p21WAF promoter contained a binding site for p53 and that p53 acted as a transcriptional activator for p21WAF (22Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5235) Google Scholar). Another CDK inhibitor, p27KIP, was first discovered in HeLa cells as a heat-stable inhibitory activity of cyclin E and D1 kinase activities (26Hengst L. Dulic V. Stingerland J.M. Lees E. Reed S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5291-5295Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and in the yeast two-hybrid system it was shown to interact with cyclin D1/CDK2 (27Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar). It was subsequently found that p27KIP was involved in the growth arrest caused by transforming growth factor-ॆ (TGF-ॆ) and contact inhibition, and since then it has been suggested that p27KIP mediates general antiproliferative effects in response to certain growth inhibitory signals (28Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3213) Google Scholar). Both p21WAF and p27KIP bind to and inactivate a variety of cyclin/CDK complexes, and existing data indicate that both cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors inhibit cyclin/CDK activity by stoichiometric binding to the cyclin regulatory subunit (reviewed in Ref. 28Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3213) Google Scholar). While it appeared that p27KIPmediated a more general antiproliferative response, p21WAFseemed to be associated with DNA damage. However, recent results suggest that p21WAF not only mediates growth arrest and apoptosis in response to DNA damage but may also be responsible for the antiproliferative effects of certain growth inhibitory stimuli, such as TGF-ॆ(29Datto M.B. Li Y. Panus J.F. Howe D.J. Xiong Y. Wang X.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5545-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar), mimosine (30Alpan R.S. Pardee A.B. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 893-901PubMed Google Scholar), okadaic acid, and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (31Zeng Y.X. el-Deiry W.S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1557-1564PubMed Google Scholar), and differentiating agents (32Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. el-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar). In all of these cases, p21WAFinduction seemed to be independent of p53 function. Additional evidence for the existence of p53-dependent and -independent p21WAF-induction pathways arises from a recent study showing that TGF-ॆ and p53 act through distinct elements on the p21WAF promoter (33Datto M.B. Yu Y. Wang X.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28623-28628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Although there is now a growing body of evidence that p21WAF can mediate a p53-independent cell cycle arrest, the function and regulation of p21WAF in response to cytoinhibitory agents remains unclear. In this report, we present evidence that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation leads to a G0/G1 block and a p53-independent induction of p21WAF. Furthermore, the work also demonstrates that inhibition of protein farnesylation results in either no effect on cell cycle distribution or accumulation of cells in G0/G1 or G2/M, depending on the type of human tumor cells. In all cases, however, these effects of FTI-277 are not due to changes in the levels of p21WAF or p27KIP. The FTase-specific peptidomimetic FTI-277 and the GGTase-I-specific peptidomimetic GGTI-298 were synthesized as described previously (9Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M.

Calu-1 cells were grown to 307 confluency and treated with vehicle or inhibitors for 48 h. Total RNA was isolated as described in Chomczynski and Sacchi (37Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63169) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were solubilized in 4 m guanidinium isothiocyanate, proteins and DNA were extracted with phenol-chloroform at pH 4, and RNA was precipitated from the aqueous phase with isopropyl alcohol. Pellets were washed with ethanol and redissolved in 0.57 SDS, and the amount of RNA was determined by UV spectroscopy. RNA aliquots (10–15 ॖg) were electrophoresed on a 17 agarose gel, transferred to nylon hybridization membranes (GeneScreen, NEN Life Science Products) and blotted with radiolabeled p21WAF and cyclophilin cDNA probes (32Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. el-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar). Hybridized membranes were exposed to x-ray film for 1–3 days depending on signal intensity. Cells were plated in 100-mm Petri dishes and treated with inhibitors or vehicle as described for the Western blot procedure, and nuclei were prepared as described (38Vindelov L.L. Christensen I.J. Nissen N.I. Cytometry. 1983; 3: 323-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were harvested by gentle scraping, pelleted by low speed centrifugation, resuspended in 200 ॖl of citrate buffer (250 mm sucrose, 40 mm trisodium citrate, 57 Me2SO, pH 7.6), and frozen at −80 °C. Before staining, cells were thawed quickly and treated with 450 ॖl of trypsin (30 ॖg/ml) followed by treatment with 375 ॖl of trypsin inhibitor (0.5 mg/ml) and RNase A (0.1 mg/ml). Nuclei were stained with 375 ॖl of ice-cold staining solution (0.4 mg/ml propidium iodide, 1.16 mg/ml spermine × 4 HCl). All solutions were prepared in a stock solution containing 3.4 mm trisodium citrate, 0.17 Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm spermine × 4 HCl, 0.5 mmTris-base, pH 7.6. DNA content was determined in a FACStar flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Unless otherwise stated, the proportions of cell in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phase were calculated from their DNA histogram using the BDIS Consort software package (Ver. 3.0, Becton-Dickinson). We have recently shown that the GGTase-I inhibitor GGTI-298 arrested NIH 3T3 and Rat-1 cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, whereas the FTase inhibitor FTI-277 had no effect on the cell cycle distribution of these cells. This study, however, was carried out in fibroblasts, and the effects of these inhibitors on epithelial cells where most human tumors originate from is not known. Furthermore, the effects of these inhibitors on cell cycle events that are involved in their ability to inhibit growth of tumors have not been investigated. We therefore used eight human carcinoma cell lines of epithelial origin (two pancreatic (Panc-1 and Colo 357), two breast (SKBr3 and MDAMB-231), two lung (Calu-1 and A-549), one bladder (T-24), one head and neck (A-253)), and one fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) to evaluate the effects of FTI-277 and GGTI-298 on cell cycle events. We first concentrated on three cell lines, Calu-1, A-253, and T-24. Cells were treated with vehicle or inhibitors as described under 舠Experimental Procedures,舡 and their DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with propidium iodide. Fig.1 shows that Calu-1, A-253, and T-24 cells treated with vehicle contained about 407 of the cells in G0/G1, 407 in S, and 207 in G2/M. GGTI-298 accumulated 70 to 907 of the cells in G0/G1. A similar effect on cell cycle distribution was observed with lovastatin, an inhibitor of protein geranylgeranylation and farnesylation. Thus, GGTI-298 and lovastatin led to a G0/G1 arrest in Calu-1, T-24, and A-253 cells. We next determined whether or not GGTI-298 can induce a G0/G1 block in other human tumor cell lines. Table I shows that GGTI-298 was able to induce an accumulation in G0/G1 in all cells evaluated including two breast, two lung, two pancreatic, one bladder, and one head and neck carcinomas, as well as a fibrosarcoma.Table IEffects of GGTI-298 and FTI-277 on cell cycle phase distribution in human tumorsCell linePercent G0/G1Percent G2/MControlFTI-277GGTI-298ControlFTI-277GGTI-298Calu-1533483164210Panc-1554684212418Colo-35751438715287T-2437639826202A-25338348619248SKBr350518513225MDAMB-23155609317163HT1080327883241811A-54955568613323Human tumor cell lines were treated with either vehicle, FTI-277 (5 ॖm) or GGTI-298 (15 ॖm), and cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Data are representative of at least two independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Human tumor cell lines were treated with either vehicle, FTI-277 (5 ॖm) or GGTI-298 (15 ॖm), and cell cycle distribution was determined by flow cytometry as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Data are representative of at least two independent experiments. In contrast to GGTI-298, which induced a G0/G1 block in all cells evaluated, the effects of FTI-277 were cell-type-dependent. The cell cycle distribution of A-253, Panc-1, SKBr3, and MDAMB-231 cells was little affected by treatment with FTI-277 (Fig. 1 and Table I). However, T-24 and HT-1080 cells accumulated in G0/G1; and Calu-1, A-549, and Colo 357 cells showed a G2/M enrichment after FTI-277 treatment (Fig. 1and Table I). This is an important finding since our previous work showed that, in NIH 3T3 and Rat-1 cells, FTI-277 does not affect cell cycle distribution (9Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar). To investigate possible mechanisms by which lovastatin, GGTI-298, and FTI-277 interfere with cell cycle progression in human tumors, we treated A-253, T-24, and Calu-1 cells for 48 h with lovastatin (30 ॖm), FTI-277 (5 ॖm), and GGTI-298 (15 ॖm) and immunoblotted cellular lysates with antibodies to p27KIP and p21WAF as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Fig.2 shows that exponentially growing Calu-1, A-253, and T-24 cells express little or no p21WAF. In contrast to cells treated with vehicle, those treated with GGTI-298 or lovastatin accumulated large quantities of p21WAF. However, treatment of cells with FTI-277 did not result in induction of the protein levels of p21WAF (Fig. 2, top panel). Higher concentrations of FTI-277 (up to 20 ॖm) did not affect p21WAF expression (data not shown). To determine whether this effect is specific to p21WAF, we carried out similar studies investigating the effects of prenyltransferase inhibitors on the protein levels of another cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27KIP. In contrast to the results with p21WAF, exponentially growing human tumor cells, treated with vehicle only, expressed detectable levels of p27KIP (Fig. 2, bottom panel). Treatment of Calu-1, A-253, and T-24 with lovastatin, GGTI-298, or FTI-277 did not affect protein levels of p27KIP (Fig. 2, bottom panel). The effect of GGTI-298, FTI-277, and lovastatin on the levels of p21WAF mRNA were next investigated by Northern blot analysis. Fig. 3 shows that exponentially growing Calu-1 cells expressed low levels of p21WAFmRNA. Treatment with GGTI-298 and lovastatin, but not FTI-277, induced accumulation of large amounts of p21WAF mRNA. To determine whether the induction of p21WAF correlates with inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation and cell cycle arrest, we treated Calu-1 cells with various concentrations of GGTI-298 and evaluated p21WAF protein levels, Rap1A processing (a small G-protein that is exclusively geranylgeranylated by GGTase-I), and cell cycle distribution as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Fig. 4 shows that GGTI-298 inhibited the processing of Rap1A in a dose-dependent manner (processed form of Rap1A (geranylgeranylated) migrates faster in SDS-PAGE than the unprocessed form) (9Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4 also shows that GGTI-298 induced the expression of p21WAF in a dose-dependent manner. However, GGTI-298 had little effect on the expression levels of cyclin E and cyclin D1 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the concentrations of GGTI-298 required to induce accumulation of cells in G0/G1 paralleled those required to induce p21WAF and to inhibit Rap1A processing (Fig. 4).Figure 4GGTI-298 Concentration-response effects on cell cycle events. Calu-1 cells were treated with GGTI-298 (0–15 ॖm), and the cells were processed and analyzed for Rap1A processing, p21WAF and cyclin D1 and E expression, and percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Data are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Finally to determine the spectrum of human tumors where GGTI-298 can induce p21WAF, we analyzed by Western blotting the protein levels of p21WAF before and after treatment with GGTI-298 in the human tumor panel described in Table I. All human tumors evaluated except HT-1080 and A-549 expressed low background levels of p21WAF (Table II). In all seven tumors that expressed low levels of p21WAF, GGTI-298 induced the expression of p21WAF (Table II). In HT-1080 and A-549 cells, that started out with high basal levels of p21WAF, no further increase in p21WAFexpression levels was seen (Table II).Table IIEffects of GGTI-298 and FTI-277 on p21WAF protein expression in human tumorsCell linep21WAF expressionControlFTI-277GGTI-298Calu-1−−+Panc-1−−+Colo-357−−+T-24−−+A-253−−+SKBr3−−+MDAMB-231−−+HT1080+++A-549+++Human tumor cell lines were treated with either vehicle, FTI-277 (5 ॖm) or GGTI-298 (15 ॖm), and p21WAFprotein levels were determined by Western blotting as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 The (−) and (+) signs designate low and high levels of expression of p21WAF protein, respectively.

Data are representative of at least two independent experiments. The results described in this manuscript clearly demonstrate that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation induces only a G1block, whereas inhibition of protein farnesylation can result either in a G1 block, a G2/M enrichment, or no effect on cell cycle distribution. The results also demonstrate that GGTI-298 but not FTI-277 induces the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21WAF. Several important conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, in T-24 and HT-1080 cells, either farnesylated or geranylgeranylated proteins can be involved in the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle. This is different from NIH 3T3, Rat-1, Calu-1, A-253, Panc-1, Colo 357, SKBr3, MDAMB-231, and A-549 cells where only geranylgeranylated proteins appear to be involved in the G1/S transition. Second, both GGTI-298 and FTI-277 caused G1 arrest in T-24 cells, yet only GGTI-298 induced p21WAF. Thus, in these cells, a farnesylated protein must be involved in the G1 to S phase transition, but this protein is not involved in the regulation of p21WAFinduction. Third, the fact that FTI-277 induced an enrichment in G2/M phase suggests that at least in some human tumors (i.e. A-549, Colo 357, and Calu-1), farnesylated proteins may play an important role in this phase transition of the cell cycle. Several geranylgeranylated and farnesylated proteins are possible candidates for the observed effects of FTI-277 and GGTI-298 on cell cycle distribution. For example, the Rho family of small G-proteins that are geranylgeranylated such as RhoA and Rac1 have been implicated in the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle (39Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). Since geranylgeranylation of these proteins is important for their cellular localization and function, inhibition of this posttranslational modification by GGTI-298 would be expected to prevent cells from entering S phase and cause their accumulation in the G1phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, constitutive activation of RhoA and Rac1 in their GTP-locked forms has been shown to result in transformation, and dominant negative forms of these proteins partially reverse malignant transformation by Ras (40Qiu R.-G.

Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6443-6453Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that GGTI-298 inhibits the growth of Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 cells, 2J. Sun, Y. Qian, A. D. Hamilton and S. M. Sebti, unpublished results. consistent with the suggestion that RhoA and Rac1 act downstream of Ras and giving further support to their importance in the mechanism of action of GGTI-298. Possible farnesylated targets for the actions of FTI-277 on cell cycle distribution are the Ras proteins. K-Ras is an unlikely target since its prenylation is resistant to FTI-277 (4Lerner E.C.

Even at concentrations as high as 50 ॖm, FTI-277 does not inhibit K-Ras prenylation in human tumors (8Lerner E.C. Zhang T.T. Knowles D. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). This is due to alternative prenylation by GGTase-I of K-Ras when cells are treated with FTase inhibitors (4Lerner E.C.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14093-14097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is our finding that K-Ras prenylation is inhibited in human tumors only when co-treated with FTI-277 and GGTI-298 (8Lerner E.C. Zhang T.T. Knowles D. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, K-Ras is not expected to play a role in FTI-277 effects on cell cycle distribution since, alone, FTI-277 is able to induce G1 block or G2/M enrichment. N- and H-Ras, on the other hand, may play a role since their prenylation is inhibited at concentrations (5 ॖm) that affect cell cycle distribution (8Lerner E.C. Zhang T.T. Knowles D. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Alternatively, other farnesylated proteins such as lamins or RhoB may also be important (42Lebowitz P.F. Du W. Prendergast G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16093-16095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The fact that FTI-277 has different effects on the cell cycle in different cell lines is intriguing and suggests that farnesylated proteins may be involved in both G2/M and G1/S phase transitions of the cell cycle. The results also suggest that the ability of FTI-277 to affect the cell cycle may be dependent on other genetic alterations that the tumor harbors. For example, the levels of cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, their inhibitors, or the status of tumor suppressor genes such as p53 and Rb, that are all involved in cell cycle regulation, may determine whether an inhibitor of protein farnesylation results in G1 block or G2/M enrichment. Whether the ability of FTI-277 to inhibit tumor growth depends on its cell cycle effects is not clear. We do know that FTI-277 inhibits the tumor growth in nude mouse xenografts of Calu-1 cells (13Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4243-4247PubMed Google Scholar), A-549, and Panc-1 cells2 and the growth on soft agar of Calu-1, A-549, Colo 357 (8Lerner E.C. Zhang T.T. Knowles D. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1283-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), MDA-MB-231, and SKBr3. 3E. Lerner, Y. Qian, A. D. Hamilton and S. M. Sebti, unpublished results. These results would argue against a requirement of G1 block or G2/M enrichment for the ability of FTI-277 to inhibit tumor growth. Seven out of the nine human tumor cell lines used in this study expressed low levels of p21WAF that were induced by GGTI-298. Since GGTI-298 also induced a G1 block in these cells, the results suggest that GGTI-298 induces a G1-block through an induction of p21WAF, which in turn could inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases. Consistent with this is our recent observation that GGTI-298 induces hypophosphorylation of Rb, a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinases (data not shown). However, GGTI-298 also induces a G1 block without further increases of the level of p21WAF in the two out of nine human tumor cell lines that express a high basal level of p21WAF. This implies that GGTI-298 can induce a G1 block by a mechanism that does not involve p21WAF induction, at least in human tumor cells that express high basal levels of p21WAF. Unlike FTI-277, which can block cells in G1 or induce G2/M enrichment, lovastatin blocks cells primarily in the G1 phase (43Keyomarsi K. Sandoval L. Band V. Pardee A.B. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 3602-3609PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of lovastatin to block cells in G1 appears to be due to its ability to inhibit protein geranylgeranylation rather than farnesylation. Indeed, several recent reports have shown that the lovastatin-induced G1 block can be released by GGOH (44McGuire T.F. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 305-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 45Crick D.C. Waechter C.J. Andres D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biotech. 1996; 9: 37-42PubMed Google Scholar), implicating geranylgeranylated proteins in the effects of lovastatin. Furthermore, we have also shown that lovastatin-induced apoptosis in A-549 (11Miguel K. Pradines A. Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Favre G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1846-1850PubMed Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cells 4W. Stark, P. Davies, A. D. Hamilton and S. M. Sebti, unpublished results. can be overcome by GGOH. Similarly, the ability of lovastatin to induce nitric-oxide synthase-2 is also dependent on inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation since it is reversed by GGOH but not FOH (16Finder J.D. Litz J.L.

Besides its ability to inhibit tumor growth and affect cell cycle in some cells, FTI-277 has little effect on other cellular events. In contrast, GGTI-298 causes profound changes in cell physiology. For example GGTI-298, but not FTI-277, inhibits PDGF- and EGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of their receptors (10McGuire T.F. Qian Y. Vogt A. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27402-27407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), enhances induction of nitric-oxide synthase-2 (16Finder J.D. Litz J.L. Blaskovich M.A. McGuire T.F.

Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Favre G. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1846-1850PubMed Google Scholar). Whether these effects are related to the ability of GGTI-298 to induce p21WAF is not known. This induction of p21WAF, however, is p53-independent. Since p21WAF is a major negative regulator of the G1 to S transition, further development of GGTase-I inhibitors may in the future lead to antineoplastic agents that not only act as general cytotoxic agents but possibly restore p53-dependent growth inhibitory responses in cells lacking functional p53.

We examined the role of protein kinase C (PKC) in the signal transduction pathway by which 20-HETE induces vasoconstriction and inhibition of whole-cell K+current in cat cerebral vascular smooth muscle. 20-HETE induced a concentration-dependent constriction in isolated pressurized cat middle cerebral arteries (−29 ± 87 at 1 ॖm). However, in the presence of anN-myristoylated PKC pseudosubstrate inhibitor peptide (MyrΨPKC-I(19–27)), 20-HETE induced a concentration-dependent vasodilation (26 ± 47 at 1 ॖm). In whole-cell voltage clamp studies, application of 20-HETE inhibited whole-cell K+ current recorded in cat cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells, an effect that was attenuated by MyrΨPKC-I(19–27).

The underlying cellular-ionic mechanism of this vasoconstrictor response appears to be depolarization-induced influx of calcium secondary to inhibition of large conductance calcium-activated potassium channels (KCa) (4Harder D.R.

Independent of the depolarization induced by inhibitory effects on KCa, recent data indicate that 20-HETE also activates L-type calcium channels in a concentration-dependent manner, an effect that is antagonized by nifedipine (8Harder D.R.

(Lond.). 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). Several reports identify a role for 20-HETE in the regulation of renal tubular ion transport. In cells of the thick ascending limb of the rat kidney, 20-HETE decreases the open state probability of an apical 70 pS K+ channel (10Wang W. Lu M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1995; 106: 727-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), thus regulating K+ recycling across the membrane and Na+ resorption. In the medullary thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, Na+-K+-(NH4+)-2Cl−transport activity is reduced by 20-HETE (11Amlal H. Legoff C. Vernimmen C. Paillard M. Bichara M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C455-C463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In proximal tubular epithelial cells, the activity of the Na+-K+ATPase is reduced by 20-HETE, an effect that is dependent upon activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (12Ominato M. Satoh T. Katz A.I. J.

These observations implicate 20-HETE in a diverse array of effector functions. However, the exact signal transduction pathway by which 20-HETE exerts these effects is unknown. Most of the effects described above could be related to an increased activity of PKC (15Liu J.-P. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1996; 116: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 16Blobe G.C.

Pharmacol. 1994; 72: 1392-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), we hypothesize that the effects of 20-HETE on cerebral arterial tone and whole-cell K+ channel current involve activation of PKC. In this report, we provide functional evidence indicating that 20-HETE promotes cerebral vasoconstriction and inhibition of whole-cell K+ current via a pathway that involves PKC. We also provide biochemical evidence that 20-HETE increases the phosphorylation of myristoylated, alanine-rich PKC substrate (MARCKS) in cultured cat cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in a concentration-related and PKC-dependent manner. Isolated cat middle cerebral arteries (outside diameter, 200–400 ॖm; length, 10–12 mm) were placed in a perfusion chamber, cannulated with glass micropipettes, and secured in place with 8-O polyethylene suture (Ethicon, Inc., Somerville, NJ), and side branches were tied off with 10-O polyethylene suture using a stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Berlin, Germany). The arterial segments were bathed in physiological salt solution (PSS) equilibrated with a 957 O2-57 CO2 gas mixture at 37 °C. During the experiment, the outflow cannula was clamped off, and the vessels were pressurized to 80 mm Hg. The inflow cannula was connected in series with a volume reservoir and a pressure transducer (Gould Instruments Division, Cleveland, Ohio) to monitor intraluminal pressure. Internal diameters of the vessels were measured with a video system composed of a CCTV camera (KP-130AU, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan), a TV monitor (CVM-1271, Sony, Tokyo, Japan), and a videomicrometer system (model 305, Colorado Video, Inc., Boulder, CO). After an equilibration period of 30 min, the arterial segments were preconstricted with 5 ॖmserotonin, and the vasodilator response to acetylcholine (1 ॖm) was determined. Vessels that exhibited no response to either serotonin or acetylcholine were excluded from the study. Cumulative concentration-response curves for 20-HETE (0.1–1000 nm) were obtained, in the absence or presence of the PKC inhibitor MyrΨPKC-I(19–27), by adding it to the bath and allowing a 10-min equilibration period. Internal diameters were measured 2–5 min after application of 20-HETE. Cerebral microvessels were isolated according to a protocol published previously (4Harder D.R. Gebremedhin D. Narayanan J. Jefcoat C. Falck J.R. Campbell W.B. Roman R. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: H2098-H2107PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adult mongrel cats were anesthetized as described above, and vessels were isolated by microdissection. Isolated vessels were minced and placed in a low-Ca2+ PSS containing 134 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.24 mm KH2PO4, 0.05 mmCaCl2, 11 mm glucose, and 10 mmHEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Vessel fragments were transferred to a vial containing 88.5 units/ml collagenase type II, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm trypsin inhibitor in low-Ca2+ PSS. The vial was placed in a water-jacketed beaker on a microstirrer, and the tissue was stirred (12 rpm) at 37 °C for a total of 1 h in the enzyme solution. At 5-min intervals, the supernatant fractions were collected and checked for appearance of dispersed cells under a microscope; fresh enzyme solution was added to the vessels for continued digestion and fraction collection. Pieces of vessel were disrupted mechanically by forcing them repeatedly through a Pasteur pipette. Fractions containing the cell suspension were transferred to a test tube and diluted with normal PSS and placed on ice. Aliquots of cells were removed from the suspension for immunofluorescence staining with anti-smooth muscle α-actin antibody (Cy3 conjugate, Sigma) and anti-factor VIII antibody (FITC conjugate, Atlantic) to confirm vascular smooth muscle origin of the cells and to assess possible contamination with endothelial cells. VSMCs thus isolated were found to be free of endothelial cell contamination and were used for seeding of cultures and for electrophysiological experiments. Outward whole-cell K+ current were recorded at room temperature from cerebral arterial muscle cells using pipette or intracellular solution containing 145 KCl mm, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mmEGTA, 2 mm magnesium adenosine triphosphate, 0.1 mm GTP, and 10 mm HEPES, with the final pH adjusted to 7.2 with KOH. The external solution bathing the cells was composed of 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, and 10 mm glucose, with pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Outward whole-cell K+ current were elicited every 1 s by depolarizing pulses of 300-ms duration from a holding potential of −70 mV to 80 mV in 10-mV increments. The effect of increasing concentrations of 20-HETE was studied before and after application of the cell-permeable PKC inhibitor, MyrΨPKC-I(19–27) (Calbiochem). The effect of the PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; Sigma) on whole-cell K+ current was studied by addition to the bath. The identification of this outward current as Ca2+-activated K+ current was justified by its sensitivity to blockade by low concentration (1 mm) of tetraethylammonium chloride or charybdotoxin (50 nm) and activation by the calcium ionophore A23187 (1 ॖm) (data not shown). Freshly dissociated cat cerebral VSMCs were prepared as detailed above. Cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 containing 207 fetal bovine serum and 17 penicillin-streptomycin, then plated onto 35-mm tissue culture dishes, and incubated at 37 °C, 57 CO2. Cell culture medium was changed twice daily for the first 3 days of culture. After 6 days of culture, the cells were suspended by treatment with trypsin-EDTA in PBS and transferred to 75-cm2 tissue culture flasks and grown in media as described above for 1 week. After 1 week, cells were split into 12-well plates for MARCKS assay or frozen in liquid nitrogen for future use. Cat cerebral VSMCs were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 207 fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 17 penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated at 37 °C with 957 humidity and 57 CO2. Cells were seeded into 12-well plates at equal density (104cells/well) and allowed to reach 807 confluence (107cells/well). MARCKS extraction was performed based on a modification of a protocol published previously and normalized to cell number prior to lysis (26Robinson P.J. Liu J.P. Chen W. Wenzel T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Prior to [32P]orthophosphate labeling, cells were serum starved for 48 h in DMEM F-12/Ham's medium with 17 penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were washed two times with phosphate-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 ॖCi of32Pi (DuPont NEN) were added in 1 ml of phosphate-free DMEM per well and incubated for 6 h at 37 °C, 57 CO2. After 6 h, test compounds 20-HETE, PMA, and PKC inhibitor were added, followed by incubation for 5 min at 37 °C. The medium was removed rapidly, the wells were washed once with PBS, and 175 ॖl of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm ZnSO4, 1 mmNa3VO4, 5 mg/ml saponin, 0.27 glycerol, and 0.57 Triton X-100) were immediately added. After 5 min of incubation in lysis buffer at room temperature, cells were scraped into a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, vortexed 20 s, and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 5 min to pellet debris. The supernatant was removed to a 1.5-ml tube, and 700 ॖl of ice-cold methanol, 175 ॖl of ice-cold chloroform, and 550 ॖl of deionized H20 were added, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged at 9000 ×g for 2 min at room temperature. The aqueous phase was removed, and 600 ॖl of ice-cold methanol were added, followed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 5 min to pellet precipitated protein. The supernatant was removed, and the samples were dried in a vacuum concentrator for 5 min to remove residual chloroform/methanol. The pellets were resuspended in 130 ॖl of 2 × SDS Laemmli sample buffer by vigorous vortexing. 130 ॖl of 807 acetic acid were added, and the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min. The acid-insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Acid-soluble proteins (MARCKS) in the supernatant were removed to a fresh tube and dried in a vacuum concentrator for 3 h, washed by resuspension in 500 ॖl of distilled water, and dried for an additional 3 h under high heat. The final sample was resuspended in 50 ॖl of 0.25 × SDS sample buffer by vigorous vortexing, boiled 3 min, and loaded along with molecular weight standards (Bio-Rad) onto 3.57 stacking/107 resolving SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (Bio-Rad Ready Gels). Following SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the gels were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were washed once with PBS, wrapped in plastic, and autoradiographed using DuPont Reflections film. Western blotting was performed to confirm equal loading and the identity of MARCKS by probing the membranes with a monoclonal antibody directed against human MARCKS (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) (data not shown). Quantitation was achieved by scanning densitometry of autoradiograms (Molecular Dynamics, Personal Densitometer) and verified by scintillation counting of excised nitrocellulose squares corresponding to MARCKS identified by Western blotting. Data are presented as the mean percentage of change in autoradiogram density for experimental treatments (PMA, 20-HETE) from the mean vehicle-treated autoradiogram density. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. where appropriate. Significant differences represent ap < 0.05 using a paired Student's ttest. 20-HETE was purchased from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA), MyrΨPKC-I(19–27) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA), and [32P]orthophosphate was from DuPont NEN (Boston, MA). DMEM, RPMI 1640, and antibiotics were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Bethesda, MD). All other chemicals were supplied by Sigma unless otherwise noted. The effects of increasing concentrations of 20-HETE on the inner diameter of isolated pressurized (80 mm Hg) cat middle cerebral arteries, in the absence or presence of MyrΨPKC(19–27) (50 ॖm), are depicted in Fig. 1. Inhibition of PKC by this pseudosubstrate peptide has been demonstrated previously to be potent and highly specific (27House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 28Eichholtz T. de Bont D.B.A. de Widt J. Liskamp R.M.J. Ploegh H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1982-1986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under control conditions, cumulative addition of increasing concentrations of 20-HETE (1 nm, 100 nm, 300 nm, and 1 ॖm) to the bath resulted in a concentration-dependent reduction in inner diameter. The percentage of change in diameter from baseline averaged −6 ± 37 (mean ± S.E.) at 1 nm, −13 ± 37 at 100 nm, −21 ± 47 at 300 nm, and −29 ± 77 at 1 ॖm (n = 6 for all concentrations studied). The vasoconstrictor effect of 20-HETE reached a maximum within 2–5 min. After washout of 20-HETE from the bath, the cannulated arterial segment was pretreated for 10 min with MyrΨPKC-I(19–27) (50 ॖm) by addition to the bath. No significant changes in the baseline diameter of the arterial segment were observed for a 10-min period after addition of the inhibitor alone. Cumulative addition of 20-HETE (1 nmto 1 ॖm) in the presence of MyrΨPKC-I(19–27) resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in diameter; the percentage of change in diameter averaged 4 ± 37 (mean ± S.E.) at 1 nm, 13 ± 67 at 100 nm, 20 ± 77 at 300 nm, and 27 ± 117 at 1 ॖm (n = 6 for all concentrations studied). The arterial preparations were washed repeatedly with fresh PSS for 30 min, after which time the effect of cumulative addition of 20-HETE (1 nm to 1 ॖm) to the bath was redetermined. The vasoconstrictor response to 20-HETE returned to the pre-inhibitor treatment level; the percentage of change in diameter from baseline averaged −13 ± 67 (mean ± S.E.) at 1 nm, −19 ± 117 at 100 nm, −28 ± 167 at 300 nm, and −34 ± 197 at 1 ॖm(n = 6 for all concentrations studied). These results demonstrate that the vasoconstrictor action of 20-HETE can be reversibly abolished by inhibition of PKC and indicates that this response is dependent on a signal transduction pathway in which PKC plays an integral role. The effects of 20-HETE on whole-cell K+ current in freshly dispersed cat cerebral VSMCs were studied using the whole-cell voltage clamp technique (29Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigwort F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15138) Google Scholar). Addition of increasing concentrations of 20-HETE (100–300 nm) to the bathing solution resulted in significant inhibition of peak whole-cell K+ current by 38 ± 47 (n = 5) at 100 nm and by 58 ± 97 (n = 5) at 300 nm (p < 0.001 compared with control) (Fig.2). 20-HETE did not appear to shift the current-voltage relationship, thus suggesting that 20-HETE decreases whole-cell current amplitude by decreasing either the probability of channel opening or the number of active channels. Addition of the MyrΨPKC-I(19–27) (100 nm) alone did not change the amplitude of the whole-cell K+ current as compared with control (Fig. 3). In the presence of MyrΨPKC-I(19–27) (100 nm), addition of 20-HETE (300 nm) to the bath failed to inhibit whole-cell K+ current (Fig. 3), indicating that inhibition of PKC prevents the inhibitory action of 20-HETE on whole-cell K+ current. In a separate series of experiments, activation of PKC by addition of 100 nm PMA resulted in a diminution of peak whole-cell outward current (Fig.4), indicating that known activators of PKC, such as PMA (30Castagna M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Sano K. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7847-7851Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), reduce the amplitude of whole-cell K+ current in cat cerebral VSMCs. The inhibitory effects of PMA on whole-cell K+ current were prevented by prior addition of 100 nm MyrΨPKC-I(19–27). Taken together, these results indicate that 20-HETE inhibits whole-cell K+ current in cat cerebral VSMCs by a mechanism that involves PKC activation.Figure 3Inhibition of PKC attenuates the inhibition of whole-cell K+ currents by 20-HETE.

Biochem. 1995; 233: 448-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). MARCKS is a heat-stable, acid-soluble protein that migrates at 80–87 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels (26Robinson P.J. Liu J.P. Chen W. Wenzel T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Previous studies in rat aortic smooth muscle cells have demonstrated expression of MARCKS, and the phosphorylation of MARCKS in these cells can be modulated by activators of PKC such as PMA and angiotensin II (26Robinson P.J. Liu J.P. Chen W. Wenzel T. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 172-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We exploited these properties of MARCKS to determine if 20-HETE induces a PKC-mediated phosphorylation of MARCKS in primary cultures of cat cerebral VSMCs. Acetic acid extraction of proteins from 32Pi-labeled VSMCs treated with PMA (100 nm) in the absence or presence of MyrΨPKC-I(19–27) (100 ॖm) or 20-HETE (100 nm and 1 ॖm) demonstrated a PKC-dependent effect of PMA and a concentration-related effect of 20-HETE on MARCKS phosphorylation (Fig.5). Treatment with PMA (100 nm) increased MARCKS phosphorylation by 73 ± 167, as assessed by scanning densitometry of autoradiograms. This PMA-induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation was completely abolished by pretreatment of cells for 5 min with 100 ॖmMyrΨPKC-I(19–27). Similarly, 20-HETE also induced an increase in MARCKS phosphorylation by 29 ± 187 at 100 nm and 46 ± 107 at 1 ॖm, as assessed by scanning densitometry of autoradiograms. The relative number of moles of 32P incorporated into MARCKS in response to the different treatments was assessed by scintillation counting of excised nitrocellulose squares corresponding to MARCKS. Baseline incorporation was 2.08 ± 0.14 fmol 32P, whereas treatment with PMA increased incorporation to 9.72 ± 0.53 fmol 32P, and treatment with 20-HETE increased incorporation to 6.23 ± 0.49 fmol and 7.47 ± 0.65 fmol at 100 nm and 1 ॖm, respectively (p < 0.05 for all with respect to baseline, n = 6). To determine if the 20-HETE induced increase in MARCKS phosphorylation was dependent on PKC activation, we treated cells with 1 ॖm 20-HETE and examined the effect of increasing concentrations of MyrΨPKC-I(19–27).

Further, the majority of work examining the role of Src family members in RTK signal transduction has been performed in fibroblasts transfected with the RTK of interest (13Kypta R.M. Goldberg Y.

In this study, we have found that Lyn is the dominant Src family member expressed in SCF-responsive cell lines as well as in normal hematopoietic progenitor cells. Further, we have demonstrated that Lyn associates with the juxtamembrane region of c-Kit (amino acids 544–577, a region just distal of the transmembrane domain) and that SCF induces rapid increases in both tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn as well as its kinase activity in vitro. Treatment of cells with antisense oligonucleotides specific for Lyn, or a Src family inhibitor, resulted in dramatic inhibition of SCF-induced proliferation. In total, these studies demonstrate that Lyn is activated by SCF and suggest that it plays a critical role in SCF-induced proliferation.RESULTSTo determine whether SCF activated Src family members in hematopoietic cells, we first examined expression of Src family members in the SCF-responsive cell line Mo7e (Fig.1 A). These cells expressed low levels of Fgr, as well as strikingly high levels of both p56 lyn and p53 lyn. Lyn was also the dominant Src family member expressed in progenitor cells isolated from human fetal liver and normal human bone marrow (data not shown). The high expression of Lyn in SCF-responsive tissues led us to examine whether SCF induced phosphorylation of Lyn. Addition of SCF to Mo7e cells resulted in a rapid and protracted increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn (Fig.1 B, upper panel). Similar results were obtained with MB-02 cells (Fig. 1 C, upper panel), an erythroblastic, SCF-responsive human cell line, as well as with normal progenitor cells isolated from human fetal liver (Fig. 1 D). In each of these experiments, immunoblotting with antibody specific for Lyn indicated that increases in the levels of Lyn did not account for the increase in tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1, B andC, lower panels). These data demonstrate that SCF induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn in two SCF-responsive cell lines as well as in normal progenitor cells. Interestingly, though p56 lyn was the dominant phosphoprotein in each cell line or tissue examined, SCF-induced phosphorylation of p53 lyn could also be observed when the experiments shown in Fig. 1 (B–D) were exposed for a longer period of time (data not shown). Thus, SCF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of both Lyn isoforms within minutes of addition to cells.To determine if SCF activated Lyn kinase activity, we examined the effects of SCF on Lyn autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation in in vitro immune complex assays. As demonstrated in Fig.2 A, treatment of Mo7e cells with SCF induced increases in Lyn autophosphorylation. Although p56 lyn was more heavily phosphorylated than p53 lyn, darker exposure of Fig. 2 A demonstrated that autophosphorylation of p53 lyn also increased after SCF treatment (data not shown). In addition to autophosphorylated p56 lyn, a 120-kDa phosphoprotein (p120) was detected in immune complex assays performed with Lyn immunoprecipitates but not in control immunoprecipitates. Our preliminary studies suggest that p120 can be reprecipitated with c-cbl antiserum and are consistent with a large body of work suggesting that the c-cbl proto-oncogene product associates with Lyn in several hematopoietic lineages (28Tezuka T.

We next examined whether SCF induced increases in the capacity of Lyn to phosphorylate a tyrosine kinase substrate in vitro. Fig.2 B demonstrates that phosphorylation of enolase was dramatically increased after stimulation of cells with SCF. These data demonstrate that stimulation with SCF induces increases in both Lyn autophosphorylation as well as increases in Lyn kinase activityin vitro.Figure 2SCF activates Lyn kinase activity in vitro. A, Lyn autophosphorylation is increased after treatment of cells with SCF. Mo7e cells were stimulated the indicated times with SCF, lysed, and immunoprecipitated (IP) with antiserum specific for Lyn or control serum (Cnt). Immune complex assays were performed, and samples resolved with SDS-PAGE and visualized with autoradiography. B, SCF induces increases in the capacity of Lyn to phosphorylate enolase.

Samples were resolved with SDS-PAGE and visualized with autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A second protein coimmunoprecipitating with Lyn was a 145-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein readily detectable in anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots of Lyn immunoprecipitates (Fig.3 A). A 145-kDa protein was also observed in Lyn immunoprecipitates from cells metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine (Fig. 3 B). Notably, these studies demonstrated that some p145 coimmunoprecipitated with Lyn in resting cells and that the amount of p145 in the immunoprecipitates increased after stimulation with SCF (Fig.3 B). The similarity in the molecular weight of p145 and c-Kit, the SCF receptor, led us to examine whether this protein was c-Kit. Indeed, Fig. 3 C demonstrates that c-Kit coimmunoprecipitated with Lyn. We did not assess whether Lyn could be coimmunoprecipitated with antiserum specific for c-Kit because both the Mo7e and MB-02 cell lines expressed extremely high levels c-Kit as compared with Lyn.Figure 3c-Kit coimmunoprecipitates with Lyn.

GST fusion proteins encoding specific regions of the intracellular domain of c-Kit were prepared and tested for the capacity to coprecipitate Lyn. We first assessed whether Lyn could be coprecipitated with a GST fusion protein encoding the juxtamembrane region of c-Kit. Competition studies with phosphopeptides have suggested that the juxtamembrane regions of the PDGF and CSF-1 RTKs are involved in interaction with Src family members (16Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Yokote K. Engstrom A. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 31Alonso G. Koegl M. Mazurenko N. Courtneidge S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9840-9848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Because Src family members associate with the PDGF and CSF-1 receptors through SH2 domains, we reasoned that Lyn association with c-Kit was likely to be phosphotyrosine-dependent (14Twamley G.M. Kypta R.M. Hall B. Courtneidge S.A. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1893-1901PubMed Google Scholar, 15Courtneidge S.A. Dhand R. Pilat D. Twamley G.M. Waterfield M.D. Roussel M.F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 943-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). To generate phosphorylated fusion protein, we expressed the GST-Kit juxtamembrane fusion protein in bacteria that could be induced to express the Elk tyrosine kinase (TKX1). Anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting confirmed that the fusion protein produced by the TKX1 bacteria contained significant levels of phosphotyrosine as compared with fusion protein expressed in DH5α bacteria (data not shown). We next examined the ability of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated GST-Kit juxtamembrane fusion protein (isolated from TKX1 or DH5α bacteria, respectively) to coprecipitate Lyn from lysates of Mo7e cells. Fig.4 A demonstrates that Lyn coprecipitated with the tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-Kit juxtamembrane fusion protein (purified from TKX1 bacteria) but not with unphosphorylated fusion protein (purified from DH5α bacteria). In addition, and somewhat surprisingly, tyrosine-phosphorylated GST-Kit juxtamembrane fusion protein coprecipitated Lyn from the lysates of both unstimulated and SCF-stimulated Mo7e cells. These data suggest that activation of Lyn is not necessary for association with phosphorylated c-Kit in vitro. Fig. 4 A also demonstrates that the GST control protein did not coprecipitate Lyn. We next examined whether Lyn was capable of associating with other regions in the c-Kit intracellular domain. Fig. 4 B demonstrates that Lyn did not associate with GST fusion proteins encoding a significant portion of either catalytic domain (K1 and Y823), the c-Kit kinase insert (KINS), or the carboxyl tail (C-tail) region.Figure 4The juxtamembrane region of c-Kit associates with Lyn. A, tyrosine-phosphorylated GST fusion protein encoding the c-Kit juxtamembrane region coprecipitates Lyn from Mo7e lysates. Mo7e cells (2 × 107) were incubated with either medium or SCF (100 ng/ml) for the indicated times. Cells were lysed and clarified, and coprecipitations were performed for 3 h at 4 °C with either GST or the GST-Kit juxtamembrane fusion protein (JXM) isolated from either DH5α or TKX1 bacteria and bound to glutathione-Sepharose. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon, and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody specific for Lyn. IP designates immunoprecipitation, andPI designates preimmune serum used for control immunoprecipitation. B, Lyn does not associate with the other regions of c-Kit. Clarified lysates from Mo7e cells stimulated with SCF were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with GST or GST fusion proteins (juxtamembrane, designated JXM; kinase region 1, designated K1; kinase insert, designated KINS; the region surrounding tyrosine 823 in kinase region 2, designatedY823; or carboxyl tail, designated C-Tail) bound to glutathione-Sepharose.

Mo7e cells were treated overnight with antisense or sense oligonucleotide, treated with additional oligonucleotides the next morning, and then incubated an additional 3 h. Proliferation assays were then performed with either medium or SCF. Shown in Fig.5 A are the effects of senseversus antisense oligonucleotides on SCF-induced proliferation of Mo7e cells. Cells treated with 0.75 ॖmor more of antisense oligonucleotides demonstrated a 907 inhibition of SCF-induced proliferation as compared with corresponding concentrations of sense oligonucleotides. Further, control experiments with nonsense oligonucleotide demonstrated that the inhibition of SCF-induced proliferation was specific for the antisense sequence (Fig.5 B). The effect of antisense oligonucleotides on expression of both p56 lyn and p53 lyn is demonstrated in Fig. 5C. Although low levels of Lyn protein could still be detected in cells treated with antisense oligonucleotides, expression was decreased significantly as compared with cells treated with sense oligonucleotides in multiple experiments. These data suggest that the decrease in SCF-induced proliferation is related to decreases in expression of Lyn protein. Identical results were obtained with normal progenitor cells isolated from human fetal liver (data not shown). Interestingly, treatment of Mo7e cells with Lyn antisense oligonucleotides also inhibited proliferation induced by GM-CSF, a growth factor that interacts with a receptor that is not a RTK (data not shown). We next examined the effects of the Lyn antisense oligonucleotides on PMA-induced proliferation. Unfortunately, the toxicity of these compounds singularly was markedly enhanced when used in combination. Cells cultured with both PMA and the Lyn oligonucleotides (sense or antisense) died.Figure 5Decreased expression of Lyn protein results in a decrease in SCF-induced proliferation. A, SCF-induced proliferation in Mo7e cells is inhibited by Lyn antisense oligonucleotides. Mo7e cells were treated with the indicated concentration of either sense or antisense oligonucleotide overnight. The following morning cells were treated with oligonucleotides for 3 h and SCF-induced proliferation assessed as described under 舠Materials and Methods.舡 Data are presented as the mean of triplicate points. B, a nonsense oligonucleotide sequence does not inhibit SCF-induced proliferation. Mo7e cells were treated with either medium or 0.75 ॖm antisense, sense, or nonsense oligonucleotides as described in A. Proliferation assays were then performed. Data are presented as the mean of triplicate points. C, treatment with Lyn antisense oligonucleotides results in reduction in expression of Lyn protein. Mo7e cells were treated with 1 ॖm sense or antisense oligonucleotides as described in A. Cells were lysed and equivalent amounts of protein were resolved using SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon. Immunoblotting (IB) for Lyn protein was performed with antibody specific for Lyn and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further assess the role of Lyn in SCF signal transduction, we examined the effect of the Src family inhibitor PP1 on SCF-induced [3H]thymidine incorporation (32Hanke J.H.

Mo7e cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of SCF and increasing concentrations of PP1 (0.037–20 ॖm). As shown in Fig.6 A, decreases in SCF-induced proliferation were noted at concentrations as low as 1.25 ॖm, with maximal inhibition observed at 5 ॖm PP1. Fig. 6 B demonstrates that a concentration of PP1 sufficient to inhibit all SCF-induced proliferation had minimal effect on PMA-induced proliferation. In total, the data from the antisense and PP1 studies suggest that Lyn plays a role in SCF-induced proliferation.Figure 6Treatment with PP1 inhibits proliferation induced by SCF but not PMA.

While much is known about activation of Src family members in response to EGF, PDGF, and CSF-1 in fibroblasts transfected with the appropriate RTK, little is known about the role of Src family members in the signal transduction pathway of SCF, a growth factor critical for normal hematopoiesis. The goal of these studies was to determine if SCF activated Src family members in hematopoietic cells and address their possible role in SCF signal transduction. We chose to examine Lyn because it was the most highly expressed Src family member in two SCF-responsive cell lines as well as in normal progenitor cells (Fig.1 A). Our studies demonstrate that SCF induced rapid increases in Lyn tyrosine phosphorylation in both hematopoietic cell lines as well as normal progenitor cells isolated from human fetal liver (Fig. 1). Further, in vitro kinase assays demonstrated that SCF induced increases in Lyn autophosphorylation as well as increases in the capacity of Lyn to phosphorylate enolase, a tyrosine kinase substrate (Fig. 2). In total, these data demonstrate that treatment of hematopoietic cells with SCF activates the Src family member Lyn.Previous work has demonstrated that numerous signal transduction components associate either directly or indirectly with RTKs.

Metabolic labeling studies with [35S]methionine demonstrated that a 145-kDa protein coimmunoprecipitated with Lyn in Mo7e cells (Fig.3 B). A 145-kDa phosphotyrosyl protein was also observed in Lyn immunoprecipitates after stimulation with SCF (Fig. 3 A). The similarity in size of the 145-kDa protein with the SCF receptor led us to examine whether p145 was c-Kit. Indeed, antiserum specific for c-Kit recognized p145 in immunoblotting studies (Fig. 3 C). Although our studies indicate that a fraction of the SCF receptor was constitutively associated with Lyn, stimulation with SCF clearly increased the amount of c-Kit that coimmunoprecipitated with Lyn (Fig.3 C). Studies with GST fusion proteins demonstrated that Lyn interacted with tyrosine residues in the c-Kit juxtamembrane region (Fig. 4). In contrast, Lyn did not bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated GST fusion proteins encoding the first catalytic domain, the kinase insert, the majority of the second catalytic domain or the carboxyl tail. Although these data do not exclude the possibility that Lyn is capable of associating with other regions of c-Kit after phosphorylation endogenously, our results demonstrate that Lyn is capable of associating with the tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Kit juxtamembrane region. These findings are consistent with previous work with Src family members and the CSF-1 and PDGF RTKs and suggest that Lyn interacts with the juxtamembrane region of c-Kit through its SH2 domain (14Twamley G.M.

To elucidate its biological function, we first set out to identify RNA species that bound to Sam68 with high affinity using in vitro selection. From a degenerate 40-mer pool, 15 RNA sequences were selected that bound to Sam68 with K d values of 12–140 nm. The highest affinity RNA sequences (K d ∼12–40 nm) contained a UAAA motif; mutation to UACA abolished binding to Sam68. Binding of the highest affinity ligand, G8-5, was assessed to explore the role of different regions of Sam68 in RNA binding. The KH domain alone did not bind G8-5, but a fragment containing the KH domain and a region of homology within the Sam68 subgroup of KH-containing proteins was sufficient for G8-5 binding. Deletion of the KH domain or mutation of KH domain residues analogous to loss-of-function mutations in the human Fragile X syndrome gene product and the Caenorhabditis elegans tumor suppressor protein Gld-1 abolished G8-5 binding. Our results establish that a KH domain-containing protein can bind RNA with specificity and high affinity and suggest that specific RNA binding is integral to the functions of some regulatory proteins in growth and development.

The major target of Src in mitotic fibroblasts appears to be Sam68, which is phosphorylated by Src and which forms a stable complex with Src via interactions involving both the Src SH2 and SH3 (Src-homology 3) domains (7Fumagalli S.

Sam68 is a nuclear protein the sequence of which is similar to some RNA-binding proteins, particularly in that it includes a KH domain.KH domains, first identified in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, have been found in diverse proteins of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin (10Gibson T.J.

Many KH-containing proteins have been shown to functionally interact with RNA in vivo and some have been shown to bind RNA in vitro. Examples include Escherichia coli NusA, which stabilizes transcriptional complexes at RNA hairpins to prevent termination (13Liu K. Hanna M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1996; 87: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) have been traced to substitutions of conserved amino acids within their KH domains. These substitutions result in growth or developmental defects, which are often more severe than the corresponding null phenotypes, suggesting that KH domains play essential roles in the functions of these proteins. However, with the exception of Fmr1 (see 舠Discussion舡), the effects of these mutations on RNA binding have not previously been determined.Sequence alignment shows that Sam68 belongs to a distinct 舠Sam68 subgroup舡 of KH-containing proteins, which includes the C. elegans tumor suppressor gene product Gld-1 (18Jones A.R. Schedl T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), the mousequaking gene product (20Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), and the mammalian splicing factors Zfm1/SF1 (21Arning S. Gruter P. Bilbe G. Kramer A. RNA (N. Y.). 1996; 2: 794-810PubMed Google Scholar, 22Toda T. Iida A. Miwa T. Nakamura Y. Imai T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Subgroup members all share a single highly conserved KH domain and a region of homology of ∼60 amino acids immediately upstream of the KH domain. We call this the SGQ (Sam68/Gld-1/Quaking homology) region.The fact that Sam68 binds to ribonucleotide homopolymers in vitro with a preference for poly(U) (9Taylor S.J. Anafi M. Pawson T. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10120-10124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and poly(A) 2Q. Lin, unpublished data. 2Q. Lin, unpublished data. provides direct evidence that it can interact with RNA. If so, it is possible that it may interact with RNA in vivo and that Src may regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level via Sam68. This hypothesis could be related to the observation that the introduction of v-Src can alter cellular RNA splicing and/or transport (23Neel H. Gondran P. Weil D. Dautry F. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A first step in exploring this hypothesis is to determine whether Sam68 has high affinity, specific RNA ligands. We identified such ligands by in vitro selection and determined the RNA and protein determinants of specific RNA binding. Our results indicate that Sam68 indeed recognizes specific RNAs in a KH-dependent manner and, by sequence homology, suggest that the functional lesions in some related RNA binding proteins result from defects in specific RNA binding.DISCUSSIONWe demonstrated previously that Sam68 binds ribonucleotide homopolymers, with a preference for poly(U) (9Taylor S.J. Anafi M. Pawson T. Shalloway D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10120-10124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, as it is unlikely that this is a physiological target, we used in vitro selection to determine whether Sam68 can bind specific RNA sequences with high affinity. Using SELEX, 15 RNA sequences were identified that bound to Sam68 with affinities as high asK d ∼12 nm. These affinities are in the same range as those reported for the binding of RNA to other RNA-binding proteins (28McCarthy J.E.G. Kollmus H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 191-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), consistent with the possibility that such binding may reflect physiologically significant interactions. Although no long consensus motif was identified, the 13 highest affinity (K d ∼12–60 nm) sequences all contained AU-rich stretches of 6–16 bases. In particular the 10 highest affinity binding species each contained a UAAA motif. Importantly, a single A to C mutation within this motif abolished binding of G8-5, the highest affinity RNA, to Sam68, implying that this motif is involved in high affinity binding, either directly or by contributing to a suitable structural conformation of the RNA. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a KH domain-containing protein binding to RNA with both specificity and high affinity; it will be interesting to see if G8-5 is a high affinity target of other such proteins, particularly members of the Sam68 subgroup. In any event, the finding that Sam68 selects RNA ligands with recognizable sequence traits and that high affinity binding can be modulated at the single base level strongly suggests a capacity for specific RNA bindingin vivo.Although the UAAA motif present in the highest affinity binding RNAs was not extensive enough to allow data base searches for matching sequences, we have noticed that it does match the last four bases of the mammalian polyadenylation signal AAUAAA (29Proudfoot N. Cell. 1991; 64: 671-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In fact, the whole poly(A) signal is contained within three of the selected sequences (G7-9, G8-4, G7-4, Fig. 2 A), although not in G8-5. The presence of AU-rich stretches in all of the selected sequences also raises the possibility that Sam68 might interact with AU-rich elements in the 3′-untranslated regions of mRNAs for proto-oncoproteins and cytokines whose expression is regulated by controlling RNA stability. Indeed, four of the selected sequences (but not G8-5) include the AUUUA motif common to one type of AU-rich element (30Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). The potential for involvement of Sam68 in regulation of polyadenylation or RNA stability clearly warrants further investigation. Furthermore, the sequence information obtained from our SELEX experiments should prove invaluable in the design of probes or inhibitors of Sam68 function in vivo.Investigating the other side of the RNA-protein interaction, we showed that the Sam68 KH domain was required but not sufficient for specific RNA binding. Although deletion of the KH domain abolished G8-5 binding, a fusion protein containing the KH domain (including the third α-helix, which is important for structural stability (12Musco G. Stier G. Joseph C. Morelli M.A.C. Nilges M. Gibson T.J. Pastore A. Cell. 1996; 85: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar)) did not bind G8-5. However, high affinity binding to G8-5 was conferred when the fusion protein was extended to include the SGQ region. The observation that the Sam68 KH domain alone does not bind a high affinity, specific RNA ligand is consistent with previous demonstrations that the multiple KH domains in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (three domains) and Fmr1 (two domains) appear to cooperate in binding to ribonucleotide homopolymers (31Siomi H. Choi M. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1994; 77: 33-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Perhaps the SGQ region in Sam68 cooperates with the KH domain in a similar manner. It will be interesting to see if other single KH domain proteins,e.g. Mer1, have similar cooperative requirements.Small deletions and point mutations within the Sam68 KH domain were sufficient to abolish specific RNA binding. It may be significant that deletion of residues 206–218 disrupts RNA binding. This corresponds structurally to the fourth loop of the KH domain (between ॆ-strands 2 and 3), which is highly conserved in the Sam68 subgroup but is not conserved or not present in KH domains from other proteins (12Musco G. Stier G. Joseph C. Morelli M.A.C. Nilges M. Gibson T.J. Pastore A. Cell. 1996; 85: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This loop could therefore be a determinant of RNA binding specificity for the Sam68 subgroup.The KH domain residues that we chose to mutate were selected because they are analogous to residues whose mutation can seriously derange growth and development in model organisms or human patients (see Introduction). The biochemical basis of most of these effects has not been firmly established. One exception is the case of Fragile X syndrome, the most common form of hereditary mental retardation, where a connection to RNA binding has been suggested. The syndrome is usually caused by expansion of trinucleotide repeats in the untranslated region of the fmr1 gene resulting in loss of its expression (17Verkerk A.J.M.H. Pieretti M. Sutcliffe J.S. Fu Y.-H. Kuhl D.P. Pizzuti A. Reiner O. Richards S. Victoria M.F. Zhang F.P. Eussen B.E. van Ommen G.-J.B. Blonden L.A.J. Riggins G.J. Chastaine J.L. Kunst C.B. Galjaard H. Caskey C.T. Nelson D.L. Oostra B.A. Warren S.T. Cell. 1991; 65: 905-914Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2862) Google Scholar). However, in one patient a severe form of the disease is associated with mutation of a conserved Ile residue in the second KH domain of Fmr1 (19De Boulle K. Ververk A.J.M.H. Reyniers E. Vits E. Hendrickx J. van Roy B. Van den Bos F. de Graaff E. Oostra B.A. Willems P.J.A. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 31-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar), and mutation of this residue can diminish Fmr1 binding to poly Uin vitro (31Siomi H. Choi M. Siomi M.C. Nussbaum R.L. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1994; 77: 33-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, we found that the analogous mutation in the Sam68 KH domain (I184N) abolishes binding to a specific, high affinity RNA ligand, G8-5. Notably, structural studies show that this mutation disrupts KH domain structure (12Musco G. Stier G. Joseph C. Morelli M.A.C. Nilges M. Gibson T.J. Pastore A. Cell. 1996; 85: 237-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).Two of the other point mutants were studied because they are analogous to loss-of-function mutations in gld-1 andquaking, the biochemical basis of which is unknown. Thegld-1 gene of C. elegans is a germ line-specific tumor suppressor gene that plays an essential role in oogenesis (18Jones A.R. Schedl T. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1491-1504Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Mutation of Gly227, the first Gly in the invariant GXXG KH domain motif, results in tumor formation, as in the null allele, indicating it is a loss of function mutation. Our results show that the analogous Sam68 mutation (G178E) abolishes binding to G8-5, suggesting that specific RNA binding is essential for Gld-1 tumor suppressor function. Similarly, loss of specific RNA binding could explain the ability of mutation of either Gly in the GXXG motif in the second KH domain of C. elegans Mex-3 to destroy its ability to regulate cell fate during early development (15Draper B.W. Mello C.C. Bowerman B. Hardin J. Priess J.R. Cell. 1996; 87: 205-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).Interestingly, the mouse quaking gene provides a converse example. Mutations in this gene result in severe defects in myelination in the central nervous system during early development and an Asp to Gly mutation in its SGQ region causes embryonic lethality (20Ebersole T.A. Chen Q. Justice M.J. Artzt K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). However, the corresponding E128G mutation in Sam68 has no effect on high affinity RNA binding, suggesting that this mutation in Quaking may affect other essential functions. However, based on our proposal that SGQ may cooperate with KH in specific RNA binding, the possibility that this residue is important for binding of Quaking-specific RNA targets can certainly not be excluded.In the absence of a more specific test, we and others have previously used binding to ribonucleotide homopolymer beads as a functional indication of RNA binding. However, our present results show that binding to poly(U) beads is unaffected by two loss-of-function point mutations (G178E and I184N), which completely abolish binding to the specific G8-5 target and is only partially diminished by deletion of the entire KH domain. We therefore believe that, whereas homopolymeric ribonucleotides are useful indicators of RNA binding potential, studies with specific RNAs are more relevant probes of biological function. Importantly the effects of functional mutations on high affinity RNA binding suggest that interaction between the RNA species selected by SELEX and Sam68 are not fortuitous but are of functional relevance.Our results indicate that Sam68 is able to bind RNA with specificity and high affinity, raising the possibility that it plays a specific role in post-transcriptional regulation of RNA processing and gene expression in a way that could be affected by Src. Numerous biochemical and genetic studies provide examples of post-transcriptional control of gene expression. 1) Genetic studies in Drosophila have illustrated the central importance of alternative splicing in sex- and tissue-specific gene expression and indicate that regulation of splicing will play a fundamental role in controlling growth and developmental specific gene expression in eukaryotes (32Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 33Chabot B. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 472-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). 2) The essential Rev protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 mediates the nuclear export of incompletely spliced RNAs that encode viral structural proteins (34Cullen B.R. Malim M.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 346-350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 35Fischer U. Huber J. Boelens W.C. Mattaj I.W. Hurt E.C. Cell. 1995; 82: 475-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Normal host cell proteins may similarly control cellular nucleocytoplasmic RNA transport in uninfected cells. 3) The stability of some mRNAs encoding growth regulatory proteins such as Myc and Fos is regulated by the binding of specific RNA binding proteins to 3′-untranslated region AU-rich elements (30Chen C.-Y.A. Shyu A.-B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 465-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar). 4) The translation of mRNAs can be regulated by cytoplasmic polyadenylation; c-mos translation is specifically activated by polyadenylation in the context of meiotic maturation (36Sheets M.D. Wu M. Wickens M. Nature. 1995; 374: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). 5) 舠Zipcode舡 sequences in 3′-untranslated regions of some mRNAs control their subcellular localization (37Kislauskis E.H. Singer R.H. Curr. Biol. 1992; 4: 975-978Crossref Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For instance, ॆ-actin mRNA is directed to the cell periphery following growth factor treatment (38Latham Jr., V.M. Kislauskis E.H. Singer R.H. Ross A.F. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1211-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 39Hill M.A. Schedlich L. Gunning P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1221-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 6) Translation is regulated by signal transduction pathways from cell surface receptors that result in phosphorylation of components of the translational machinery (40Brown E.J. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1996; 86: 517-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These events have been shown, or are presumed, to be mediated by a diverse group of proteins that can interact with target RNAs under control of upstream regulatory proteins.Because of its ability to specifically interact with RNA and with growth regulatory proteins such as Src, Sam68 is in a unique position to mediate post-transcriptional control of gene expression. Although its presence in the nucleus suggests a role for Sam68 in transcription or in the early steps of RNA processing, it is becoming clear that many apparently nuclear RNA binding proteins are able to shuttle between nucleus and cytoplasm by virtue of specific nuclear export and import sequences (41Fischer U. Michael W.M. Luehrmann R. Dreyfuss G. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 290-293Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The possibility that Sam68 may do the same is strengthened by the finding that Sam68 can interact with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of poliovirus and that Sam68 redistributes from the nucleus to cytoplasmic sites of viral replication a few hours after poliovirus infection of HeLa cells (42McBride A.E. Schlegel A. Kirkegaard K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2296-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Moreover, Sam68 could potentially interact with cytoplasmic RNAs during mitosis and these interactions might be modified by binding to and phosphorylation by Src.The high degree of sequence conservation between Sam68 and its relatives points to conservation of biochemical function and specific RNA binding. Since Gld-1 and Quaking play essential roles in regulation of growth and development in worms and mice, it is likely that Sam68 will play a key role in mammalian growth and/or developmental control. A role in growth control and cell cycle regulation is suggested by its association with a proto-oncoprotein, Src, specifically during mitosis. More direct evidence for a role of Sam68 in cell cycle control is provided by recent results showing that expression of a splice variant of Sam68 in which part of the KH domain is deleted inhibits serum-stimulated progression into S phase of the cell cycle (24Barlat I.

Sam68 is a nuclear protein the sequence of which is similar to some RNA-binding proteins, particularly in that it includes a KH domain. KH domains, first identified in heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, have been found in diverse proteins of prokaryotic and eukaryotic origin (10Gibson T.J. Rice P.M. Thompson J.D. Heringa J.

The core resembles the apical domain of GroEL but lacks the hydrophobic residues implied in binding of substrates to group I chaperonins. Rather, a large hydrophobic surface patch is found in a novel helix-turn-helix motif, which is characteristic of all group II chaperonins including the eukaryotic TRiC/CCT complex. Models of the holochaperonin, which are consistent with cryo electron microscopy data, suggest a dual role of this helical protrusion in substrate binding and controlling access to the central cavity independent of a GroES-like cochaperonin."
https://openalex.org/W2022942610,"The NADPH oxidase cytochromeb 558 is a membrane heterodimer comprised of a glycosylated 91-kDa subunit, gp91 phox, and a nonglycosylated 22-kDa subunit, p22 phox. The role of heme in cytochrome b 558 biosynthesis was studied using succinyl acetone, an inhibitor of heme synthesis, in PLB-985 myeloid cells undergoing granulocytic differentiation. Succinyl acetone markedly reduced expression of p22 phox and the mature 91-kDa form of gp91 phox but not its 65-kDa high mannose precursor, in association with a profound reduction in NADPH oxidase activity. Expression of non-heme-containing cytosolic oxidase components was unaffected. The reduction in cytochrome b 558 expression and NADPH oxidase activity was prevented by adding exogenous heme and was reversible upon removal of succinyl acetone. Transgenic expression of gp91 phox in monkey COS-7 and murine 3T3 cells, both of which lacked endogenous p22 phox mRNA, demonstrated that p22 phox was not required for maturation of gp91 phox carbohydrate to complex oligosaccharides. However, coexpression of transgenic p22 phox increased the abundance of the mature gp91 phox glycoprotein. These results suggest that heme incorporation plays an important role in cytochromeb 558 assembly and provide further support for the concept that stability of p22 phox and the mature gp91 phox subunit is increased by heterodimer formation."

One of the most abundant lesions in both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA is 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG). We report here the partial purification and characterization of a mitochondrial oxidative damage endonuclease (mtODE) from rat liver that recognizes and incises at 8-oxoG and abasic sites in duplex DNA. Rat liver mitochondria were purified by differential and Percoll gradient centrifugation, and mtODE was extracted from Triton X-100-solubilized mitochondria.

Gel filtration chromatography predicts mtODE's molecular mass to be between 25 and 30 kDa. mtODE has a monovalent cation optimum between 50 and 100 mm KCl and a pH optimum between 7.5 and 8. mtODE does not require any co-factors and is active in the presence of 5 mm EDTA. It is specific for 8-oxoG and preferentially incises at 8-oxoG:C base pairs. mtODE is a putative 8-oxoG glycosylase/lyase enzyme, because it can be covalently linked to the 8-oxoG oligonucleotide by sodium borohydride reduction.

Reactive oxygen species are generated in cells as a by-product of cellular respiration. Reactive oxygen species react with proteins, lipids and DNA causing cellular damage. When DNA is the target, a variety of DNA adducts are formed. Among these, 8-oxoG is one of the most abundant lesions generated (1Ames B.N. Free Radical Res.

Since many reactive oxygen species are generated by oxidative processes that occur in mitochondria, it is of great interest to understand the oxidative DNA damage processing in these organelles. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is composed of a 16.5-kilobase pair circular genome, encoding 13 structural genes, 22 tRNAs, and two rRNAs. The DNA lies in close proximity to the free radical-producing electron transport chain, and it has been reported that mtDNA contains a higher level of oxidative DNA damage than nuclear DNA (6Richter C. Park J.W. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 6465-6467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Since mtDNA is subjected to relatively high levels of oxidative damage, mitochondria need DNA repair mechanisms to maintain their DNA genomes. Mitochondrial DNA repair mechanisms differ from those in the nucleus. Evidence to suggest that mitochondria lacked DNA repair mechanisms came from the observation that UV damage is not repaired in mitochondria (7Clayton D.A. Doda J.N. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 89: 7370-7374Google Scholar,8LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Beecham E.J. Stevnsner T. Wassermann K. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), while it is efficiently processed in the nucleus by nucleotide excision repair. In addition, damage caused by cisplatin and nitrogen mustard, agents that are known to induce DNA adducts that are substrates for the nuclear nucleotide excision repair pathway, is inefficiently repaired in mitochondria (8LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Beecham E.J. Stevnsner T. Wassermann K. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). From these studies it has been widely assumed that mitochondria have no DNA repair capacity. Clearly, nucleotide excision repair, as it exists in the nucleus, does not appear to be present in mitochondria. However, it still remains to be determined whether nucleotide excision repair factors participate in mitochondrial DNA repair. This laboratory and others have demonstrated that mitochondria repair some forms of DNA damage. DNA damage induced by monofunctional alkylating agents, alloxan, streptozotocin, and acridine orange, agents that generate lesions known to be repaired by base excision repair (BER), is removed from mtDNA (8LeDoux S.P.

Further support for BER in mitochondria comes from the fact that enzymes involved in BER such as uracil DNA glycosylase, apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonucleases, and a methyl transferase have been purified from mitochondria (14Anderson C.T. Friedberg E.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1980; 8: 875-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 15Domena J.D. Timmer R.T. Dicharry S.A. Mosbaugh D.W.

Recently, recombination repair has been reported in mitochondria (8LeDoux S.P. Wilson G.L. Beecham E.J. Stevnsner T. Wassermann K. Bohr V.A. Carcinogenesis. 1992; 13: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 19Thyagarajan B. Padua R.A. Campbell C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27536-27543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Thus, it is evident that mitochondria contain some base excision and recombinational DNA repair mechanisms. BER is an important mechanism that cells use for the removal of oxidative DNA damage. In the process of BER, a damage-specific glycosylase recognizes a damaged base and then cleaves theN-glycosylic bond between the sugar and the base, generating an AP site. Some glycosylases have an associated AP lyase function that cleaves the DNA phosphate backbone, while others rely on AP endonucleases for strand cleavage. Next, a phosphodiesterase excises the 3′-terminal unsaturated sugar derivative. The resulting one-nucleotide gap is resynthesized by a DNA polymerase, and the ends are sealed by a DNA ligase (20Dianov G. Lindahl T. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 1069-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The isolation of oxidative damage repair glycosylases from higher eukaryotes has been challenging due to the fact that these enzymes are typically expressed at very low levels in cells. Only recently have genetic approaches proven successful in the cloning of the yeast, mouse, and human enzymes (21van der Kemp P.A. Thomas D. Barbey R. de Oliveira R. Boiteux S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The purification of enzymes from mitochondria is even further complicated by the necessity to isolate pure mitochondria in sufficient quantities for such studies. This together with the low abundance of these enzymes has been the reason for the lack of progress in the isolation of mitochondrial repair enzymes. Thus, no oxidative damage-processing enzymes from mitochondria have been purified or characterized extensively. Previous studies from this laboratory and others suggested that mitochondria may contain a glycosylase/lyase enzyme responsible for the removal of oxidative damage (13Taffe B.G. Larminat F. Laval J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 929-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In our recent study on the repair of oxidative damage in mitochondria, Chinese hamster ovary cells were exposed to acridine orange plus light for the purpose of introducing 8-oxoG and other oxidative DNA damage lesions (13Taffe B.G. Larminat F. Laval J. Croteau D.L. Anson R.M. Bohr V.A. Mutat. Res. 1996; 364: 183-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The DNA repair profile showed that these lesions were rapidly removed from the mitochondrial genome with more than 607 of the lesions repaired within 4 h, suggesting that mammalian cells possess mitochondrial enzymes that recognize and remove 8-oxoG. In this study, we have partially purified a mitochondrial oxidative damage endonuclease that is responsible for the recognition and incision of 8-oxoG and abasic sites. This is the first report of the purification of an 8-oxoG DNA damage-processing enzyme from mitochondria. Livers were removed from 6-month-old male white Wistar rats (Gerontology Research Center animal colony). The columns and chromatography matrices were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, and E-64 were from Boehringer Mannheim. Benzamidine HCl, dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were from Sigma. Radioisotopes were from NEN Life Science Products. G-25 spin columns were purchased from 5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc. (Boulder, CO). T4 polynucleotide kinase was obtained from U.S. Biochemical Corp. Fpg protein was provided by Dr. Arthur Grollman (Stony Brook, NY). Endonuclease III and endonuclease IV were purchased from Trevigen, Inc. Uracil DNA glycosylase was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. To determine the localization of mtODE within the mitochondria, Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria were subjected to a nonspecific protease treatment. The Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria were separated into two samples; one was incubated with Pronase (7.5 mg/ml) and resuspended in 120 mm KCl and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, while the other fraction was incubated with buffer. mtODE activity was assayed from both fractions with protease inhibitors present as described below. To confirm the localization of mtODE within mitochondria, the Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria were subjected to fractionation by digitonin according to the method of Ragan (27Ragan C.I. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Practical Approach Series. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 80-83Google Scholar). Digitonin fractionation separated the mitochondria into two compartments, the outer membrane and inner membrane/matrix fractions. Once separated, the composition of the individual fractions was examined by enzymatic analysis. The activity of monoamine oxidase, a marker for the outer membrane, was measured spectrophotometrically according to the method described by Ragan (27Ragan C.I. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Practical Approach Series. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 80-83Google Scholar). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was measured spectrophotometrically as a marker for the inner membrane/matrix compartment as described by Sottocasa et al.(28Sottocasa G.L. Kuylenstierna B. Ernsterl L. Bergstrand A. J. Cell Biol. 1967; 32: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Also, lactate dehydrogenase activity was measured to determine the level of cytosolic contamination in the Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria as described by Wroblewski et al. (29Wroblewski F. LaDue J.S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Bio. Med. 1955; 9: 210-213Crossref Scopus (2025) Google Scholar). mtODE activity was measured as described below. All oligonucleotides were from Midland Certified Reagent Co., except for the TG oligonucleotide and its complementary strand, which were synthesized by Paragon Biotech, Inc. In addition, the TOG oligonucleotide, containing the 8-oxoG, was provided by Dr. Francis Johnson (Stony Brook, NY). The sequences of the oligonucleotides utilized in this study are displayed in Table I. Oligonucleotides containing either the DNA lesion of interest or an unmodified base were 5′-end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. To separate the free [γ-32P]ATP from the oligonucleotides, the reaction mixture was passed through a G-25 spin column. Complementary oligonucleotides were annealed in 100 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, and 1 mm EDTA by heating the oligonucleotides to 80 °C and then allowed to cool slowly to room temperature.Table IOligonucleotide substrates usedThe important features of the olignucleotides are underlined and in boldface type.

Incision reactions (20 ॖl) contained 40 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.6), 75 mm KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5.9 nm32P-labeled duplex, and the column fractions at the amounts indicated for each experiment. The reaction was incubated overnight at 32 °C and then terminated by the addition of 0.8 ॖl of 5 mg/ml proteinase K and 0.8 ॖl of 107 SDS and incubated for 15 min at 55 °C. The DNA was ethanol-precipitated by the addition of 4 ॖl of 11 mammonium acetate, 1 ॖg of glycogen, and 60 ॖl of ethanol. The DNA was pelleted, dried, then resuspended in formamide dye containing 907 formamide, 0.0027 of bromphenol blue, and 0.0027 xylene cyanol, heated to 80 °C for 2 min, and subjected to electrophoresis on a denaturing 207 polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. Samples containing the AP oligonucleotide were heated to 55 °C, instead of 80 °C, prior to loading due to the heat lability of the AP site. After electrophoresis, the gel was subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C. Quantitation of results employed a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant NT software. We define 1 unit of 8-oxoG endonuclease activity as 1 fmol of oligonucleotide incised during an 18-h incubation at 32 °C. The AP oligonucleotide listed in Table I was originally synthesized with a uracil at the 11th position. To generate the abasic site oligonucleotide, uracil DNA glycosylase (1 unit) was incubated with the uracil-containing oligonucleotide duplex for 30 min at 37 °C. To demonstrate that AP sites were generated, endonuclease III (1 unit), IV (1 unit), or Fpg protein (0.8 unit) were added and incubated with the duplex for 2 h, under the conditions described for oligonucleotide incision assay. More than 977 of the oligonucleotide was incised by each enzyme. To generate the ring-opened guanine adduct, FapyG, the FC oligonucleotide (Table I) was treated with dimethyl sulfate and alkali according to Chetsanga and Lindahl (30Chetsanga C.J. Lindahl T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1979; 6: 3673-3684Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The resultant oligonucleotide product was designated FapyG. To demonstrate that this treatment induced the FapyG adduct, the oligonucleotide was duplexed with its complementary oligonucleotide and incubated with Fpg protein (0.8 unit) for 2 h at 37 °C under oligonucleotide incision assay conditions. Greater than 577 of the oligonucleotide was sensitive to Fpg cleavage. To determine whether any abasic sites were generated in the course of preparing the substrate, the FapyG duplex was incubated with endonuclease IV (1 unit) or endonuclease III (1 unit), resulting in 3 and 67 of the oligonucleotide being incised, respectively. Mitochondria were purified from rat liver using a combination of differential and Percoll gradient centrifugation (modified from Ref. 31Gasnier F. Rousson R. Lerme F. Vaganay E. Louisot P. Gateau-Roesch O. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 212: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Briefly, fresh liver was minced and homogenized in 1 × M-SHE buffer (0.21 m mannitol, 0.07 msucrose, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.75 mmspermidine). The following protease inhibitors were added just before use: 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 2 ॖm benzamidine-HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Unbroken cells and nuclei were pelleted at 500 ×g. The supernatant, containing the mitochondria, was centrifuged at 9,500 × g to pellet the mitochondria. The mitochondria were resuspended and washed twice with 1 × M-SHE buffer. Mitochondria (2 ml) were layered onto a Percoll solution (37.5 ml; 507 Percoll and 507 2 × M-SHE) and centrifuged at 50,000 × g in a Ti-60 rotor for 1 h. The brown mitochondrial band was collected either by fractionating the gradient or by direct syringe aspiration. The collected mitochondria were pooled, diluted 10-fold with 1 × M-SHE, and then pelleted by centrifugation. The mitochondria were resuspended in 50 ml of 1 × M-SHE, washed, pelleted, and then frozen at −80 °C until lysis. The Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria (1.7 g) were resuspended in 15 ml of buffer A containing 300 mm KCl. Buffer A contained 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 57 glycerol, 0.0157 Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and the following protease inhibitors were added just before use: 1 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 1 ॖg/ml pepstatin A, 1 ॖg/ml chymostatin A, 2 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 2 ॖmbenzamidine HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 ॖm E-64. Mitochondria were solubilized by adding sterile filtered 107 Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 0.57 and then clarified by centrifugation for 1 h at 130,000 ×g in a SW-50.1 rotor, (fraction I). The clarified mitochondrial supernatant (fraction I, 453 mg) was applied to a 15-ml DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated with buffer A containing 300 mm KCl. After applying the sample, the column was washed with 50 ml of the same buffer. Five-ml fractions were collected. The majority of the mtODE activity did not bind the column. Fractions containing the bulk of the protein were pooled, and the salt concentration was adjusted to 100 mm KCl with buffer A and designated fraction II. Fraction II (384 mg) was loaded directly onto a FPLC 10/10 HR Mono S column equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm KCl. The column was washed with equilibration buffer until a stable base line was attained and then eluted with a 40-ml linear KCl gradient (100 mm to 1 m KCl). One-ml fractions were collected. Fractions were dialyzed against buffer A containing 100 mm KCl overnight and assayed for mtODE activity. The 8-oxoG oligonucleotide incising activity eluted after the bulk of the protein as a single peak at approximately 650 mm KCl (fraction III). At this stage in the purification, mtODE has an absolute requirement for detergent in the dialysis buffer. Fraction III (0.586 mg) was dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 300 mm KCl, 57 glycerol, 0.0157 Triton X-100, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) and loaded onto a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 gel filtration column that had been equilibrated with buffer B. The column was calibrated with blue dextran 2000, albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsinogen A, and ribonuclease A (low molecular weight standards; Pharmacia). The column fractions (0.4 ml) were dialyzed against buffer A overnight and then assayed for activity. The elution profile of standard proteins was used to calculate the molecular weight of mtODE. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated, and stored in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, and 507 glycerol at 4 °C (fraction IV, 0.097 mg). Reactions were carried out as described above except that the experiments were performed in the presence of 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaBH4 (freshly prepared), and 20 mm KCl instead of 75 mm KCl (modified from Ref. 32Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). To monitor the extent of the incision, 2 ॖl of the reaction was added to 5 ॖl of formamide dye, heated to 80 °C for 2 min, and then electrophoresed through a 207 polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. To detect the covalent complex, 15 ॖl of the reaction was added to 15 ॖl of 2 × SDS-PAGE loading buffer (Novex), boiled for 10 min, and then separated by a 127 PAGE gel (Novex). Quantitation of the results was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The major source of DNA repair enzymes is the nucleus; therefore, purification of mitochondria is a crucial step in the isolation of mitochondrial DNA repair enzymes. Using mitochondria isolated by differential and Percoll gradient centrifugation, we identified an enzymatic activity that specifically incised an 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotide (Fig.1 A, lanes 3 and4). To determine whether the mtODE activity was contained within the mitochondria, the Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria were treated with a nonspecific protease, Pronase, at 7.5 mg/ml for 9 min on ice. This exposure to protease causes extensive digestion of myofibrils and inactivates cytosolic enzymes in routine preparation of heart mitochondria. When compared with mitochondria that had not been exposed to protease, 847 of mtODE's activity remained (Fig.1 A, compare lanes 4 and 6). To further demonstrate that the mtODE activity is contained within mitochondria, submitochondrial fractions were prepared by treating the Percoll gradient-purified mitochondria with digitonin as described by Ragan (27Ragan C.I. Darley-Usmar V.M. Rickwood D. Wilson M.T. Practical Approach Series. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 80-83Google Scholar). Fractionation by digitonin produced two fractions, an outer membrane and a mitoplast fraction. The mitoplast fraction contains both the mitochondrial inner membrane and matrix compartments. The mitochondrial outer membrane fraction was associated with enhanced monoamine oxidase activity and low cytochrome c oxidase and mtODE activity (Table II). When compared with the outer membrane compartment, the mitoplasts had lower monoamine oxidase activity and higher cytochrome c oxidase and mtODE activity. The majority of mtODE's activity (887) co-localized to the mitoplast compartment along with the cytochrome c oxidase activity. Lactate dehydrogenase was assayed in the crude liver homogenate and in the Percoll gradient-purified mitochondrial fractions to determine the level of cytosolic protein contamination. The activity declined 14-fold from 8.4 ± 0.1 to 0.6 ± 0.1 ॖmol/mg/min, respectively, suggesting limited amounts of cytosolic contamination.Table IIEnzyme activities in fractionated mitochondriaFractionMonoamine oxidase2-aEnzyme activities were measured as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.Cytochrome coxidase2-aEnzyme activities were measured as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.mtODE2-aEnzyme activities were measured as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.nmol/mg/minॖmol/mg/minfmol/100 ॖg proteinMitochondria8.6 (2.8)16.3 (2.4)38.7 (3.0)Mitoplasts2-bPercoll gradient purified mitochondria were fractionated by treatment with digitonin as described by Ragan (27).8.3 (1.0)12.1 (0.7)28.4 (1.8)Outer membrane2-bPercoll gradient purified mitochondria were fractionated by treatment with digitonin as described by Ragan (27).61.7 (7.6)5.2 (2.0)3.9 (3.7)2-a Enzyme activities were measured as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Data are presented as the mean ± S.E.2-b Percoll gradient purified mitochondria were fractionated by treatment with digitonin as described by Ragan (27Ragan C.I.

Open table in a new tab An oligonucleotide duplex containing a unique 8-oxoG was employed as a substrate to follow the purification of an 8-oxoG incising activity from rat liver mitochondria. mtODE was purified approximately 500-fold from isolated mitochondria, and the purification is summarized in Table III. The most purified fraction has three bands migrating at approximately the 30,000 molecular weight range as detected by silver staining of a SDS-polyacrylamide gel.Table IIIPurification of mtODE from rat liver mitochondriaFractionVolumeTotal proteinActivity3-aOne unit of activity is defined as 1 fmol of 8-oxoG oligonucleotide incised per 18-h incubation.Specific activitymlmg10 3 units10 3 units/mg I.

Open table in a new tab As determined by gel filtration, the active enzyme eluted at a position corresponding to a molecular weight range of 25,000–30,000, assuming a globular protein (Fig. 2). mtODE has an optimum KCl concentration between 50 and 100 mm KCl. While it is active across a broad pH range, its pH optimum is between pH 7.5 and 8.0. Divalent cations are not required, and mtODE is resistant to 5 mm EDTA. The substrate specificity of mtODE (fraction IV) was examined. The oligonucleotide incision assay was carried out using a panel of substrates including single-stranded oligonucleotides, duplexed oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG, an abasic site, FapyG adducts, or their respective unmodified control oligonucleotide duplexes (Fig. 3). mtODE does not incise 8-oxoG in single-stranded DNA (lane 2); however, duplexed 8-oxoG and abasic sites are cleaved by mtODE (lanes 4 and 6, respectively). Duplexes containing the ring-opened guanine adduct, FapyG, were also not recognized by the mtODE. As seen in Fig. 3, there is a weak incision product produced in the FapyG lane (47 of oligonucleotide incised); however, this is due to AP sites in the oligonucleotide and not to cleavage of FapyG residues, because both endonuclease IV and III were able to generate the same level of incision (3 and 67 of oligonucleotide incised, respectively). The lack of FapyG cleavage was confirmed by another assay. We measured the release of [3H]FapyG from calf thymus DNA by the assay described by de Oliveira (33de Oliveira R. van der Kemp P.A.

The docking/fusion of GLUT4 vesicles with the plasma membrane appeared to utilize a similar mechanism, since expression of a dominant interfering mutant of syntaxin-4 prevented both insulin- and osmotic shock-induced GLUT4 translocation. However, although the insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport activity was completely inhibited by wortmannin, activation by osmotic shock was wortmannin-insensitive. Furthermore, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation and activation of the Akt kinase, whereas osmotic shock was completely without effect. Surprisingly, treatment of cells with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, or microinjection of phosphotyrosine antibody prevented both the insulin- and osmotic shock-stimulated translocation of GLUT4. In addition, osmotic shock induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of several discrete proteins including Cbl, p130 cas, and the recently identified soluble tyrosine kinase, calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase (CADTK). In contrast, insulin had no effect on CADTK but stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl and the tyrosine dephosphorylation of pp125FAK and p130 cas.

In these tissues, insulin increases glucose uptake by regulating the intracellular trafficking of the GLUT4 protein. In the basal state, GLUT4 cycles continuously between the plasma membrane and one or more intracellular compartments, with the vast majority of the transporter residing within the cell interior (3Jhun B.H.

Activation of the insulin receptor triggers a large increase in the rate of GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis in addition to a smaller decrease in the rate of internalization by endocytosis. This insulin-dependent shift in the cellular dynamics of GLUT4 vesicle trafficking results in a net increase of GLUT4 protein level on the cell surface, thereby increasing the rate of glucose uptake (for recent reviews, see Refs.5Holman G.D.

Furthermore, growth factor activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, also known as protein kinase B or RAC-PK, is a downstream target of the activated PI 3-kinase (27Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M.

In this regard, stable expression of a constitutively active membrane bound form of Akt in 3T3L1 adipocytes resulted in increased glucose transport and persistent localization of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane (31Kohn A.D.

For example, osmotic shock of fibroblasts has recently been reported to stimulate Akt kinase activity in a manner analogous to growth factor activation (33Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This finding is of particular interest, since early studies in the 1960s and 1970s demonstrated that hyperosmolarity had potent insulin-like properties on glucose metabolism, including activation of glucose transport in adipocytes and skeletal muscle (34Kuzuya T. Samols E. Williams R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Clausen T. Gliemann J. Vinten J. Kohn P.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Based upon these data, we hypothesized that a comparison between the effect of insulin and osmotic shock may provide an important approach to identify common and unique signaling pathways leading to increased glucose transport activity. In the present study we demonstrate that, similar to insulin, osmotic shock of 3T3L1 adipocytes stimulates glucose transport activity through increased GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. Insulin- and osmotic shock-stimulated GLUT4 translocation also share a common docking/fusion mechanism requiring syntaxin-4 as a functional t-SNARE. However, in contrast to insulin, osmotic shock stimulates GLUT4 translocation by activation of a tyrosine kinase signaling pathway independent of the PI 3-kinase and the Akt kinase. These data demonstrate the presence of a novel tyrosine kinase signaling pathway that converges with the insulin-stimulated pathway for GLUT4 translocation downstream from both the PI 3-kinase and Akt kinase in adipocytes.DISCUSSIONIt has been well established that insulin stimulates the translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter isoform from intracellular vesicular storage sites to the plasma membrane in both muscle and adipose cells. This translocation process accounts for the majority of the insulin-stimulated increase in glucose transport activity. Although the mechanism by which insulin orchestrates these intracellular trafficking events has not been determined, several important signaling molecules have been implicated in this process. For example, reduction of IRS-1 level by either ribozyme expression in adipocytes or homologous recombination in mice resulted in an impairment of insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity and GLUT4 translocation (79Quon M.J.

More recently, it has been shown that growth factor activation of the Akt kinase is PI 3-kinase-dependent, and stable overexpression of a constitutively active membrane-bound form of Akt induces persistent activation of glucose transport activity and cell surface localization of the GLUT4 protein (31Kohn A.D.

Introduction of nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues, muscle contraction/exercise, okadaic acid, and anoxia can all stimulate glucose transport activity (40Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J.

Since none of these stimuli result in the activation of the insulin receptor kinase itself, it is presumed that they converge with the insulin signal pathway at a more distal signaling step. In particular, early studies on glucose transport activity observed that osmotic shock is a potent activator of glucose uptake in adipocytes and skeletal muscle (34Kuzuya T. Samols E. Williams R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 2277-2283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Clausen T. Gliemann J. Vinten J. Kohn P.G. Biochim. Biophys.

Thus, we reasoned that the dissection of osmotic shockversus insulin signaling might provide new insight into glucose transport regulation by identifying common and/or distinct pathways leading to GLUT4 translocation.Based on this speculation, we first determined whether osmotic shock stimulated glucose transport activity by inducing the translocation of GLUT4. Our data demonstrate that, compared with insulin, the relative extent of GLUT4 translocation (approximately 507 of the insulin effect) directly correlated with the relative increase in glucose transport activity. More interestingly, the ability of osmotic shock to stimulate GLUT4 translocation occurred by a PI 3-kinase-insensitive pathway. The presence of a PI 3-kinase-insensitive pool of translocating GLUT4 vesicles has also been observed in other systems. For example, exercise or contraction of skeletal muscle is also a potent activator of glucose transport activity and GLUT4 translocation, which occurs in a wortmannin-insensitive manner (61Lund S. Holman G.D. Schmitz O. Pedersen O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5817-5821Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 63Yeh J.-I. Gulve E.A. Rameh L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2107-2111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Furthermore, GLUT4 translocation induced by other stimuli such as the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, or uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation is also independent of PI 3-kinase activation (85Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 87Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Gautier N. Cormont M. Van Obberghen E.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Since a previous study observed that osmotic shock of COS-7 cells resulted in the activation of Akt (33Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Tanaka M. Ono Y. Tokunaga C. Kuroda S. Kikkawa U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7639-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), we speculated that the Akt kinase could be a potential point of convergence between insulin and osmotic shock signaling downstream of the PI 3-kinase. However, in contrast to insulin, osmotic shock was unable to induce either Akt phosphorylation or protein kinase activation in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes. At present, we do not know the basis for the difference between osmotic shock stimulation of Akt in COS-7 cellsversus 3T3L1 adipocytes. Nevertheless, our data clearly demonstrate that the ability of osmotic shock to induce GLUT4 translocation is independent of both PI 3-kinase and Akt activation.Surprisingly, however, pretreatment of the 3T3L1 adipocytes with the selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein prevented both insulin- and osmotic shock-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Consistent with the requirement of a tyrosine kinase signaling cascade, single cell microinjection of phosphotyrosine antibodies also prevented both insulin- and osmotic shock-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. Although there are caveats associated with the use of both kinase inhibitors and high concentrations of microinjected antibodies, the fact that both agents that utilize distinct mechanisms to block protein kinase activity were effective independent inhibitors of insulin- and osmotic shock-stimulated GLUT4 translocation strongly suggests that osmotic shock functions through a tyrosine kinase signaling pathway.The ability of osmotic shock to directly stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation events was confirmed by phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Several discrete tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the range of 115–130 kDa and 55–70 kDa were clearly induced by osmotic shock treatment without any evidence of either insulin receptor or IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, no detectable plasma membrane proteins were tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to osmotic shock. Consistent with previous studies, we did observe an apparent insulin-induced dephosphorylation of plasma membrane-associated pp125FAK. Furthermore, insulin also induced the tyrosine dephosphorylation of p130 cas, which presumably results from the tyrosine dephosphorylation and inactivation of pp125FAKactivity. In any case, since osmotic shock had no effect on the phosphorylation state of pp125FAK but enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of p130 cas, it is unlikely that pp125FAK or p130 cas are involved in a convergent pathway leading to GLUT4 translocation.pp125FAK and CADTK are two members of a new tyrosine kinase family characterized by a centrally located tyrosine kinase domain, at least two proline-rich domains, and a focal adhesion targeting sequence. However, these enzymes do not have intrinsic SH2 or SH3 domains but rather provide tyrosine autophosphorylation sites and SH3 domain recognition sequences with which other SH2 and SH3 domain containing effector proteins can associate. CADTK was originally identified as a trimeric G protein-coupled receptor-stimulated soluble tyrosine kinase that can also be activated by both calcium- and protein kinase C-dependent and independent pathways (44Yu H.

One important difference between pp125FAK and CADTK is that in adherent cells pp125FAK is constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated, whereas CADTK is neither active nor tyrosine-phosphorylated (77Li X. Earp H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14341-14348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Rather, CADTK is rapidly activated (within 15 s) by a variety of agonists and growth factors (44Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M.

The basal tyrosine phosphorylation state of paxillin and p130 cas have been correlated with pp125FAKactivation, whereas CADTK appears responsible for the agonist-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of these two cytoskeletal proteins (44Yu H. Li X. Marchetto G.S. Dy R. Hunter D. Calvo B. Dawson T.L. Wilm M. Anderegg R.J. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. J. Biol.

These results are similar to the data presented in this manuscript in which the basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation state of p130 cas appears to be controlled by pp125FAK. However, the osmotic shock-dependent increase in CADTK tyrosine phosphorylation correlated with the increase in p130 cas tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, CADTK remains a potential tyrosine kinase candidate that (i) phosphorylates p130 cas and (ii) mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation pathway from osmotic shock to GLUT4 translocation.In addition to pp125FAK, p130 cas, and CADTK, Cbl is another protein in this molecular weight range that undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation by multiple stimuli. Recently, insulin has been reported to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes but not in 3T3L1 fibroblasts or other cell types transfected to express the insulin receptor (78Ribon V. Saltiel A.R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 839-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We have also observed that both insulin and osmotic shock induced a transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl. However, osmotic shock stimulated a significantly greater extent of Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation than insulin but was not as effective as insulin in promoting GLUT4 translocation. Thus, although it remains possible that Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation is a point of convergence between insulin- and osmotic shock-induced GLUT4 translocation, these differences make this possibility less likely.In summary, our data demonstrate that there is a novel insulin receptor-independent tyrosine kinase pathway leading to GLUT4 translocation in adipocytes. This signaling pathway does not require the targeting and/or activation of the PI 3-kinase or the Akt kinase. However, it apparently utilizes, at least in part, the same vesicle docking/fusion mechanism (syntaxin-4) that is used by insulin. Whether CADTK, which is a genistein-inhibitable tyrosine kinase that is activated by osmotic shock, and/or Cbl tyrosine phosphorylation are causally related to the stimulation of GLUT4 translocation is an important issue for future investigation. The facilitative glucose transporters are a family of related integral membrane proteins that are responsible for the regulation of whole body and cellular glucose homeostasis. Unlike other members of this family, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter isoform (GLUT4) 1The abbreviations used are: GLUT4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter isoform; PI 3-kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase, CADTK, calcium-dependent tyrosine kinase; SN"

To evaluate the role of PLTP in vivo we generated recombinant adenovirus vectors containing either human PLTP cDNA (rPLTP.AdV) or the reporter luciferase cDNA as a control. After intravenous infusion of 4 × 107 plaque-forming units (low dose) and 4 × 108 plaque-forming units (high dose) of rPLTP.AdV into mice, PLTP activity in plasma increased from base-line levels of 8.4 ± 0.2 to 108 ± 17 and from 8.9 ± 0.6 to 352 ± 31 ॖmol/ml/h, respectively, on day 4 (both p < 0.001). Thus, both low and high doses of rPLTP.AdV led to pronounced overexpression of human PLTP in mice. On day 4 after treatment, mice treated with low and high doses of rPLTP.AdV showed decreased HDL cholesterol (−547 and −917) and apoA-I (−647 and −987) (allp < 0.05). Kinetic studies revealed that the fractional catabolic rates of HDL labeled with [3H]phosphatidylcholine, [14C]phosphatidylcholine ether, [3H]cholesteryl ether, and 125I-labeled mouse apoA-I were increased by 8.5-, 8.7-, 3.8-, and 2.8-fold, respectively, in mice treated with low dose rPLTP.AdV (all p < 0.001). After injection of labeled HDL, mice treated with rPLTP.AdV showed an increased accumulation of labeled PC ether (+3047) and cholesteryl ether (+927) in the liver (both p < 0.05). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of plasma 5 min after injection of HDL labeled with 125I-apoA-I demonstrated increased levels of newly generated pre-ॆ-HDL in mice overexpressing PLTP. In conclusion, HDL remodeling mediated by PLTP generates nascent, lipid-poor apoA-I in vivo and accelerates the hepatic uptake of HDL surface and core lipids in mice treated with rPLTP.AdV.

The rate of spontaneous transfer of phospholipids between circulating lipoproteins in human plasma is too slow to allow for the rapid intravascular remodeling of lipoproteins (1Tall A.R.

Of the two plasma lipid transfer proteins, only CETP is capable of additionally catalyzing the transfer of neutral core lipids between HDL and other lipoproteins, whereas PLTP is not (5Tall A.R.

In the last 2 years, our understanding of the structure of PLTP has advanced considerably (13Albers J.J. Tu A.-Y. Wolfbauer G. Cheung M.C. Marcovina S.M. Curr. Opin.

Despite these advances, the physiological role of PLTP in lipoprotein metabolism is still unclear.

We conclude that pronounced overexpression of PLTP in vivo (i) leads to shedding of nascent, lipid-poor apoA-I from mature HDL particles; (ii) increases the plasma clearance of phospholipids, cholesteryl esters, and apoA-I in HDL leading to low HDL levels; and (iii) enhances the hepatic uptake of phospholipids and cholesteryl esters from HDL.

Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2474) Google Scholar), i.e.rLucif.AdV, was generated in an analogous way. An appropriate aliquot of the purified recombinant adenovirus containing either 4 × 107 plaque-forming units (pfu) or 4 × 108pfu was infused into the saphenous vein of the mice on day 0 of the study. Male C57Bl mice (4–7 months of age) were housed at the National Institutes of Health under protocols approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the NHLBI and fed a regular chow diet (NIH-07 chow diet 57 fat; Zeigler Brothers Inc., Gardners, PA). Blood samples from the retroorbital plexus were obtained from mice fasted for 4 h and anesthetized with methoxyflurane (Pitman-Moore, Mundelein, IL), placed into precooled tubes containing EDTA (final concentration 4 mm), centrifuged at 2500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, and aliquots of plasma were stored at −70 °C. Ten ॖl of plasma from fasting mice was diluted 1:50 with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and total cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and free cholesterol were determined using enzymatic kits from Sigma and Wako Chemicals (Richmond, VA) and the COBAS MIRA Plus automated chemistry analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Systems, Branchburg, NJ). HDL cholesterol was measured by dextran sulfate precipitation (Ciba-Corning, Oberlin, OH), as described previously (22Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrot C.L. Applebaum-Bowden D. Meyn S. Talley G. Paigen B. Maeda N. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined with the BCA protein reagent (Pierce). Apolipoproteins A-I and A-II were quantitated by a sandwich or competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively, utilizing polyclonal antibodies raised in rabbits and purified mouse apoA-I and apoA-II as protein standards. Two-dimensional electrophoresis of plasma lipoproteins was performed as described previously (23Asztalos B.F. Sloop C.H. Wong L. Roheim P.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1169: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Briefly, in the first dimension, lipoproteins were separated by electrophoresis on 0.77 agarose gels; subsequently, in the second dimension, lipoprotein size was determined by nondenaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis (2–367). After blotting, membranes were developed with polyclonal anti-mouse apoA-I antibodies. For visualization of PLTP protein in mouse plasma by immunoblot, 0.2 ॖl of plasma was resuspended in 20 ॖl of sample buffer, separated in a 4–207 Tris-glycine gel (Novex, San Diego, CA), and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride microporous membranes (Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride; Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Human PLTP was identified by blotting with rabbit anti-human PLTP IgG (kindly provided by Dr. Christian Ehnholm) and visualized by a biotinylated secondary antibody (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Plasma lipoproteins from either individual mice or pooled mouse plasma were separated by gel filtration using two Superose 6 HR 10/30 columns connected in series (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Lipoproteins were eluted at a constant flow rate of 0.3 ml/min with PBS buffer containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.027 sodium azide. PLTP activity was measured as the ability of plasma to facilitate the transfer of [3H]dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine ([3H]PC) from PC vesicles to HDL3 as described previously (24Speijer H. Groener J.E.M. van Ramshorst E. van Tol A. Atherosclerosis. 1991; 90: 159-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 25Damen J. Regts J. Scherphof G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 712: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 ॖmol ofl-α-phosphatidylcholine type XI-E (Sigma), 1 ॖCi ofl-α-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (NEN Life Science Products), and 0.1 ॖmol of butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma) were mixed, and the lipids were dried down under nitrogen, suspended in 1 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4), probe-sonicated, and centrifuged to remove lipid aggregates and titanium debris. Plasma samples were incubated with [3H]PC vesicles (125 nmol of PC) and HDL3 (250 ॖg of protein) in a final volume of 400 ॖl of 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation, vesicles were precipitated by the addition of 300 ॖl of a solution of 500 mm NaCl, 215 mm MnCl2, 445 units/ml heparin, the precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and 500 ॖl of the supernatant were counted in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Sample volumes were chosen to keep phospholipid transfer in the linear range of the assay. Transfer of [3H]PC during the incubation was less than 157 of the total counts. Phospholipid transfer activity is expressed as ॖmol of PC transferred/ml plasma/h. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (22Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrot C.L. Applebaum-Bowden D. Meyn S. Talley G. Paigen B. Maeda N. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, livers from mice killed 4 days after infusion of rLucif.AdV were homogenized, subjected to three freeze/thaw cycles, and centrifuged. The supernatants were incubated with luciferin in the presence of a reaction mixture containing 16.4 mm MgCl2 and 5.4 mm ATP, and light emission was quantitated with a luminometer. Mouse HDL were labeled with [3H]PC and [14C]dihexadecylether-PC as described previously (3Tollefson J.H. Albers J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 797-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma from male C57Bl mice was adjusted to a density of 1.063 g/ml with KBr and centrifuged for 5 h at 95,000 rpm in a TLA-100.2 rotor using a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments) at 5 °C. The 1.063 infranatant was adjusted to a density of 1.21 g/ml with KBr and centrifuged for 10 h at 95,000 rpm at 5 °C (26Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6476) Google Scholar). The 1.21 g/ml supernatant containing the HDL was subsequently dialyzed against PBS. Fifty ॖCi ofl-α-dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine or [14C]dihexadecylether-PC (both from NEN Life Science Products) were dried under nitrogen, dissolved in 957 ethanol, and incubated with the isolated HDL for 18 h at 37 °C. The labeled HDL were then reisolated at d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml and dialyzed extensively against PBS. Labeled HDL showed no appreciable degradation of apolipoproteins based on immunoblot analysis. Homogeneous labeling of HDL was ascertained by superimposing radioactivity and chemistry profiles obtained by fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). More than 987 of the label comigrated with dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine on thin layer chromatography. l-α-Phosphatidylcholine type XI-E (Sigma), cholesteryl-1,2-[3H]hexadecylether (NEN Life Science Products), and butylated hydroxytoluene (Sigma) (500/1/6; mol/mol/mol) were dried down under nitrogen, and then 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, EDTA 0.017 was added and liposomes were prepared from these constituents by sonication as described previously (27Morton R.E. Zilversmit D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11992-11995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Liposomes were incubated with mouse HDL (d 1.063–1.21 g/ml, 3 mg of total protein) and mouse d > 1.21 serum (30 mg of total protein) for 18 h at 37 °C. Labeled HDL were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation at 1.063 and 1.21 g/ml density in a TLA-100.2 rotor using a TL-100 ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) (26Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6476) Google Scholar). Labeled HDL showed no appreciable degradation of apoA-I and apoA-II as judged by immunoblot analysis. Homogeneous labeling of HDL was ascertained by superimposing radioactivity and chemistry profiles obtained by FPLC. More than 99.77 of the label comigrated with cholesteryl esters on thin layer chromatography. Less than 3.87 of [3H]cholesteryl ether was transferred from labeled HDL to LDL (HDL-CE:LDL-CE mass ratio = 0.1) in 0.15 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, during an 18-h incubation at 37 °C without the addition of CETP. Lyophilized mouse apoA-I was iodinated by a modification of the iodine monochloride method (28McFarlane A.S. Nature. 1958; 182: 53Crossref PubMed Scopus (1497) Google Scholar) as described previously (29Gregg R.E. Zech L.A. Schaefer E.J. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1167-1176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 0.5 mol of iodine was incorporated per mol of protein. Four ॖg of 125I-mouse apoA-I were mixed with mouse HDL (250 ॖg of protein), isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation (1.063–1.21 g/ml) (26Havel R.J. Eder H.A. Bragdon J.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1955; 34: 1345-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (6476) Google Scholar), and dialyzed extensively against sterile PBS containing 0.017 EDTA at 4 °C. Radioactivity was quantitated in a Packard Cobra γ-counter (Packard Instrument Co.). One million dpm of HDL labeled with [3H]PC, [14C]dihexadecylether-PC, [3H]cholesterylpalmityl-ether, or 5 ॖCi of125I-labeled mouse apoA-I were injected into the saphenous veins of mice that had been infused with 4 × 107 pfu of rPLTP.AdV or rLucif.AdV, respectively, 4 days previously. Plasma disappearance curves were generated by dividing the plasma radioactivity at each time point by the plasma radioactivity at the initial 1-min time point, which was the same among the study groups (all p > 0.4). The fractional catabolic rate was determined from the area under the plasma radioactivity curves using a multiexponential curve fitting technique on the SAAM program (30Berman M. Weiss M. SAAM Manual, DHEW Publication (National Institutes of Health) 78:180. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1978Google Scholar). ApoA-I production rates were calculated from the following formula: production rate = (apoA-I plasma concentration × plasma volume × fractional catabolic rate)/weight. After the 15-min blood sample was collected, a subset of mice injected with [14C]dihexadecylether-PC or [3H]cholesterylpalmityl-ether-labeled HDL were perfused with cold 0.15 m NaCl; livers, heart, lung, spleen, kidneys, adrenals, and testes were harvested and extracted in 20 volumes of chloroform-methanol, 2:1 (v/v); phases were separated by the addition of water (31Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and aliquots of the lower phase were counted in a Tri-Carb 2500 TR liquid scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Mean recoveries at 15 min were higher than 897 of injected counts for all groups with no statistical differences between the groups (both p > 0.7). Values are presented as means ± S.E. Comparisons between groups of mice treated with equivalent doses of rPLTP.AdV and rLucif.AdV, respectively, were made using Student'st test for independent samples (two-tailed). To investigate the in vivo role of PLTP, we utilized rAdV to express human PLTP as well as the reporter gene luciferase in male C57Bl/6 mice. Immunoblot analysis using rabbit anti-human PLTP IgG confirmed the presence of authentic PLTP (81 kDa) in the plasma of mice treated with rPLTP.AdV (Fig.1 A). Two different doses of recombinant adenovirus, a low dose corresponding to 4 × 107 pfu and a high dose corresponding to 4 × 108 pfu were studied. The radioassay utilized to quantitate PLTP expression has been previously demonstrated to be specific for PLTP (5Tall A.R. Abreu E. Shuman J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2174-2180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Tu A.-Y. Nishida H.I. Nishida T. J. Biol.

Acta. 1982; 712: 444-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and involves the transfer of [3H]PC from PC liposomes to HDL. On day 4 after infusion of low and high doses of rPLTP.AdV, phospholipid transfer activity in plasma was increased to 108 ± 17 and 352 ± 31 ॖmol/ml/h compared with mice receiving equivalent doses of rLucif.AdV (7.0 ± 0.96 and 8.3 ± 0.48 ॖmol/ml/h) (both p < 0.001) (TableI). Analysis of the time course of expression of PLTP in a subset of mice injected with high dose rPLTP.AdV revealed that PLTP activity in plasma peaked at day 4 and gradually decreased thereafter (Fig. 1 A). However, even at day 15 after treatment, PLTP activity was still increased at 30.2 ± 1.68 ॖmol/ml/h compared with control mice (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1 A). The time course of expression of the PLTP transgene is, thus, similar to that of several other transgenes delivered previously by the same vector (22Kashyap V.S. Santamarina-Fojo S. Brown D.R. Parrot C.L. Applebaum-Bowden D. Meyn S. Talley G. Paigen B. Maeda N. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1612-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 32Applebaum-Bowden D.

Thus, adenovirus-mediated delivery of the human PLTP cDNA primarily to the mouse liver leads to a significant, although transient, increase of biologically active PLTP in mouse plasma.Table IPhospholipid transfer activity in plasma in C57Bl mice after infusion of recombinant adenovirusrAdVPLTP ActivityPreinfusionPostinfusionॖmol/ml/hrPLTP.AdV Low dose (4 × 107pfu)8.4 ± 0.20108 ± 16.641-ap < 0.001 (rPLTP.AdV low doseversus rLucif.AdV low dose).

Groups were compared using Student's ttest for independent samples (two-tailed). Table II summarizes the effects of PLTP overexpression on the plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations on day 4 after infusion of low and high doses of rPLTP.AdV compared with age- and sex-matched control mice receiving an equivalent amount of rLucif.AdV. In the low dose rPLTP.AdV group, cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, HDL-cholesterol, apoA-I, and apoA-II decreased by 55, 48, 55, 54, 64, and 677, respectively, after treatment (all p < 0.05) (Table II). In the high dose rPLTP.AdV group, cholesterol decreased by 277, and triglycerides, phospholipids, HDL-cholesterol, apoA-I, and apoA-II decreased by 79, 45, 91, 98, and 1007 after treatment (all p < 0.005) (Table II). Comparison of the time course of PLTP activity in plasma (Fig. 1 A) and the time course of the decrease in HDL established a strong inverse relationship between the level of overexpression of PLTP at days 2–11 and the level of HDL cholesterol (Fig. 1 B) and apoA-I (Fig. 1 C). On day 15 after treatment, when PLTP activity in plasma was still increased at 30.2 ± 1.68 ॖmol/ml/h (p < 0.001), no changes in plasma lipids were detectable (data not shown). Examination of HDL subfractions by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis showed an almost complete loss of α-migrating HDL and, interestingly, an increase in pre-ॆ-HDL on day 4 after treatment with rPLTP.AdV (Fig.2). At base line, FPLC showed that the lipoprotein profiles of the study groups were very similar and that HDL was the major lipoprotein (data not shown). In mice treated with low dose rPLTP.AdV, FPLC analysis on day 4 revealed a marked decrease in HDL phospholipids and cholesterol (Fig.3, A and B). Mice treated with high dose rPLTP.AdV showed an even more pronounced decrease in HDL, and, additionally, an increase in VLDL phospholipids and cholesterol (Fig. 3, A and B). Immunoblot analysis of the VLDL indicated that the lipoprotein particles contained apoB-48, apoB-100, and apoE (data not shown).Table IIPlasma lipids and lipoproteins in C57Bl mice after infusion of low (4 × 107 pfu) and high doses (4 × 108 pfu) of recombinant adenovirusAdVCholesterolTriglyceridesPhospholipidsHDL-CholesterolApoA-IApoA-IImg/dlLow dose rPLTP.AdV (4 × 107 pfu) Preinfusion105 ± 4.299 ± 9.3195 ± 7.470 ± 3.7100 ± 8.211.0 ± 3.7 Postinfusion47 ± 11.92-ap < 0.001.51 ± 6.82-ap < 0.001.88 ± 16.92-ap < 0.001.32 ± 8.82-ap < 0.001.36 ± 11.32-ap < 0.001.3.6 ± 2.32-bp < 0.0"

To further characterize endophilin, we generated an antipeptide antibody. Endophilin is enriched in the brain, and immunofluorescence analysis reveals a high concentration of the protein in synaptic terminals, where it colocalizes with synaptojanin. In vitro binding assays demonstrate that endophilin binds through its src homology 3 domain to synaptojanin, and immunoprecipitation analysis with the antiendophilin antibody reveals that endophilin is stably associated with synaptojanin in the nerve terminal. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody against amphiphysin I and II, which interact through their src homology 3 domains with dynamin and synaptojanin at sites distinct from those for endophilin, reveals a second stable complex, which includes dynamin and synaptojanin but excludes endophilin. These data demonstrate that synaptojanin is present in two separate complexes in the nerve terminal and support an important role for endophilin in the regulation of synaptojanin function.

These data demonstrate that synaptojanin is present in two separate complexes in the nerve terminal and support an important role for endophilin in the regulation of synaptojanin function. The accuracy and speed of information processing in the nervous system is critically dependent on 舠fast舡 synaptic transmission. At the presynaptic level, there are two key events underlying this process: the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles from the nerve terminal, resulting in neurotransmitter release, and the endocytosis of synaptic vesicle membranes, which restores the releasable vesicle pool. Although knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying exocytosis has advanced considerably in recent years, the process of endocytosis is still poorly understood. One of the few molecules with an established function in endocytosis is the GTPase dynamin, which participates in the fission of endocytic vesicles (for review, see Ref. 1De Camilli P. Takei K. McPherson P.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The role of dynamin in endocytosis was first predicted by studies on the Drosophila shibiremutant in which mutations of Drosophila dynamin lead to a block of synaptic vesicle endocytosis (2Chen M.S.

Nature. 1991; 351: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutations in the GTPase domain of mammalian dynamin inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis when overexpressed in fibroblasts (4Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 5van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J.

The C terminus of dynamin contains a proline-rich region that interacts with proteins containing Src homology 3 (SH3) domains (7Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). An important SH3 domain-containing binding partner for dynamin is amphiphysin I (8David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 9Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P. J. Biol.

Amphiphysin I is enriched in nerve terminals and is homologous to the yeast proteins RVS161 and RVS167 (10David C. Solimena M. De Camilli P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), mutations in which cause endocytic defects (11Munn A.L. Stevenson B.J. Geli M.I. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1721-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The SH3 domain-mediated interaction between dynamin and amphiphysin I appears to be an essential step in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles, serving to target dynamin to clathrin-coated pits (12Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 13Shupliakov O. Löw P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). In the nerve terminal, amphiphysin I is likely targeted to these endocytic sites through SH3 domain-independent interactions with the clathrin adaptor protein 2 (AP2) (8David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 14Wang L.-H. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol.

Recently, we and others have identified a novel amphiphysin isoform, referred to as amphiphysin II, that also binds through its SH3 domain to dynamin (15Leprince C. Romero F. Cussac D. Vayssiere B.

Both amphiphysin I and II also interact with clathrin, which is likely to contribute to amphiphysin targeting to the endocytic machinery (17Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I. McPherson P.S. J.

Several other proteins besides dynamin and the amphiphysins have been implicated in endocytosis, although compelling evidence for their roles is still lacking. Synaptojanin is a nerve terminal-enriched protein, which, like dynamin, binds to the amphiphysin I and II SH3 domains and undergoes dephosphorylation upon synaptic terminal depolarization (17Ramjaun A.R.

Synaptojanin is an inositol 5-phosphatase with activity against a number of substrates, including inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, insitol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (21McPherson P.S.

Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of synaptojanin is similar to the cytosolic domain of the yeast protein SAC1, which has been implicated in vesicular trafficking, likely via alterations in phospholipid metabolism and diacylglycerol production (24Kearns B.G. McGee T.P. Mayinger P. Gedvilaite A. Phillips S.E. Kagiwada S. Bankaitis V.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The C terminus of synaptojanin is proline-rich and binds to the SH3 domains of amphiphysin I and II. Recently, another SH3 domain-containing protein, SH3P4 (25Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nature Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), was identified as a major binding partner for synaptojanin (26de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). We had independently isolated SH3P4 as a member of a novel SH3 domain-containing family of proteins with unknown function using an expression library screen with an SH3 domain peptide ligand (25Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nature Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the current study, we determined that SH3P4 is brain specific and is enriched in the presynaptic nerve terminal. Using in vitrobinding assays, we determined that SH3P4, amphiphysin I, and amphiphysin II each bind to distinct sites within the proline-rich tail of synaptojanin, and the three proteins can bind to synaptojanin simultaneously. However, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that,in situ, two separate and stable synaptojanin complexes are formed: synaptojanin with SH3P4, and synaptojanin with amphiphysin I or II and dynamin. These results suggest an important role for SH3P4 in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, possibly through regulating the recruitment of synaptojanin to the site of endocytosis, and we thus renamed SH3P4 as endophilin. Polyclonal antiendophilin antibodies (1903 and 1904) were made against an 18-residue peptide (residues 256–272, CQPKPRMSLEFATGDSTQ), synthesized at the W. M. Keck Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University (New Haven, CT), and conjugated to KLH (Calbiochem) as described (27Schneider W.J. Slaughter C.J. Goldstein J.L. Anderson R.G.W. Capra J.D.

The conjugated peptide was injected into rabbits (approximately 600 ॖg per rabbit) using Titermax adjuvant (CytRx Corp.) with standard protocols.

The supernatant was diluted to 2 mg/ml of protein in 20 mmHEPES-OH, pH 7.4, containing 0.83 mm benzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 17 Triton X-100 (Buffer A), and 1-ml aliquots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the GST fusion proteins described above (approximately 25 ॖg/ml of each protein) prebound to glutathione-Sepharose. After incubation, samples were washed three times in 1 ml of buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and prepared for Western blot analysis. Nitrocellulose membranes with protein fractions purified by endophilin affinity chromatography were incubated overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline (50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.3, 150 mm NaCl) containing 37 bovine serum albumin, 0.17 Tween-20, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 500,000 cpm/ml of phosphorylated full-length endophilin GST fusion protein. The fusion protein was phosphorylated with heart muscle protein kinase (Sigma) following the protocol supplied by the manufacturer of the pGEX-2TK vector (Pharmacia). Transfers were then washed three times for 5 min each in Tris-buffered saline and exposed to film. For the overlay assays on synaptojanin, full-length synaptojanin and a synaptojanin deletion mutant lacking the 231-amino acid proline-rich C terminus (synaptojanin R-2) were purified from Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells after baculovirus-mediated expression as described (26de Heuvel E.

To construct a synaptojanin deletion mutant lacking the last 127 amino acids of the proline-rich C terminus, PCR was performed on a full-length synaptojanin cDNA (clone 9) (21McPherson P.S.

The forward primer (5′-GGTGATGTCGACGACTAC) corresponds to nucleotides 3178–3195 spanning a SalI site, and the reverse primer, R-1 (5′-GCGGTCGACAAGCTTTTATGCAAGTCCGGCTTGAGG) corresponds to nucleotides 3619–3636 and encodes a SalI site flanking aHindIII site.

The clones were packaged into baculovirus and used to infect Sf9 cells, and the expressed proteins were purified as described (26de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 ॖg each of the various synaptojanin proteins were run on SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and overlaid with GST-endophilin, GST-amphiphysin I, GST-amphiphysin II, or GST alone as described (19McPherson P.S. Czernic A.J. Chilcote T.J. Onofri F. Benfenati F. Greengard P. Schlessinger J. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6486-6490Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A (His)6-endophilin fusion protein was prepared by digesting the pGEX-2TK plasmid containing full-length endophilin, prepared as described above, withBamHI and EcoRI and ligating the liberated fragment into the BamHI–EcoRI sites of pTrcHisA (Invitrogen). The (His)6 fusion protein was expressed and purified as recommended for the QIA express system using Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen). To examine the interactions of endophilin and amphiphysin with synaptojanin and dynamin, approximately 2 ॖg of GST fusion proteins of the SH3 domains of amphiphysin I or amphiphysin II, precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads, were incubated with 1 ॖg of purified synaptojanin or dynamin and increasing concentrations of purified (His)6/endophilin. Dynamin was purified from Sf9 cells after baculovirus-induced expression as described (32Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and was a generous gift of Dr. Sandra Schmid (Scripps Research Institute). The reactions were carried out in 1 ml of Buffer A for 4 h at 4 °C. For all binding assays, at the end of the incubations, the beads were pelleted by microcentrifugation, washed three times in 1 ml of Buffer A, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and prepared for Western blot analysis. A crude synaptosomal fraction (P2′) was prepared from rat brain as described (33Huttner W.B. Schiebler W. Greengard P. De Camilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1374-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). It was resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES-OH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 0.83 mmbenzamidine, 0.23 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 ॖg/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 ॖg/ml leupeptin (Buffer B). The samples were then homogenized with a Polytron, Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 0.17, and the samples were incubated for 20 min at 4 °C before removing insoluble material by centrifugation at 75,000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman TLA 100.2 rotor. The supernatant was precleared with protein A-Sepharose and was then incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with antiendophilin (1903) or antiamphiphysin sera (1874) precoupled to protein A-Sepharose. Finally, samples were washed three times with 1 ml of Buffer B containing 0.17 Triton X-100 and were eluted with SDS sample buffer. To further characterize endophilin, we generated polyclonal rabbit antisera (1903 and 1904) against a peptide sequence specific to the protein. After affinity purification, both antibodies recognized a single 40-kDa band on strips of crude brain homogenate (data not shown). Endophilin has a predicted molecular mass of 39,880 Da (25Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nature Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). When tested on immunoblots from a variety of tissues, endophilin immunoreactivity was observed only in brain (Fig.1). We next examined the subcellular localization of endophilin on frozen sections from rat brain using immunofluorescence. Endophilin immunoreactivity had a predominantly punctate appearance, indicative of a concentration of the antigen in presynaptic nerve terminals (Fig.2, A and B). There was also a relatively high level of immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm of cell bodies. Cell nuclei were immunonegative, as were axons. The pattern of endophilin immunoreactivity looked very similar to that of synaptojanin, as well as the synaptic markers synapsin (Fig.2 B) and synaptophysin (data not shown). Interestingly, endophilin, like synaptojanin, appeared to be absent from mossy fiber axon terminals in the CA3 region of the hippocampus (Fig.2 B), which was the only brain region examined where endophilin and synaptojanin did not co-localize with known synaptic markers. To identify binding partners of endophilin, we performed affinity chromatography on crude rat brain extracts using a full-length endophilin GST fusion protein. We then overlaid the column elution fraction with radiolabeled endophilin and observed three major bands at 145, 135, and 100 kDa (Fig.3 A). Western blots of the elution fractions identified the 145- and 100-kDa bands as synaptojanin and dynamin, respectively (Fig. 3 B). The identity of the 135-kDa endophilin-binding protein remains unknown. To further delineate the interactions, affinity chromatography was performed using GST fusion proteins encoding the N-terminal and the SH3 domains of endophilin, and both synaptojanin and dynamin were found to specifically bind to the SH3 domain (Fig. 3 B). In addition to endophilin, synaptojanin can also bind to amphiphysin I (8David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar) and amphiphysin II (17Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To begin to determine the sites of interaction on synaptojanin for these three proteins, the 170-kDa isoform of synaptojanin (34Ramjaun A.R. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24856-24861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as well as the 145-kDa isoform and two deletion constructs lacking the last 127 amino acids of the proline-rich C terminus (synaptojanin R-1) or the entire 231 amino acid proline-rich C terminus (synaptojanin R-2), were purified from Sf9 cells after baculovirus-mediated expression. Western blot analysis confirmed an equal loading of each protein (Fig. 4). These constructs were then overlaid with GST fusion proteins containing either the SH3 domain of endophilin, amphiphysin I, or amphiphysin II. GST alone did not interact with any of the synaptojanin proteins (Fig.4). In contrast, endophilin and amphiphysin I SH3 domain fusion proteins bound to the 170- and 145-kDa isoforms of synaptojanin and to synaptojanin R-1 but did not bind to synaptojanin R-2. Thus, there is a binding site(s) for the SH3 domains of endophilin and amphiphysin I between amino acids 1061 and 1165 of synaptojanin. Interestingly, the amphiphysin II SH3 domain did not bind to synaptojanin R-1 or R-2, indicating that the binding site for this protein lies between amino acids 1165 and 1276. These results suggested that endophilin and amphiphysin I bind proline-rich sequence(s) in the same region of synaptojanin that is different from the binding site of amphiphysin II. To further characterize the interactions between these proteins, we incubated GST fusion proteins encoding the SH3 domains of amphiphysin I or amphiphysin II, prebound to glutathione-Sepharose beads, with constant amounts of synaptojanin in the presence of increasing concentrations of (His)6/endophilin. In both cases, the formation of a complex of endophilin, synaptojanin, and the amphiphysin isoform was observed (Fig. 5) suggesting that the amphiphysin isoforms bind to proline-rich sequences distinct from the endophilin binding site. Coupled with the results from Fig. 4, these data suggest that the three proteins each interact with a unique site within the proline-rich tail of synaptojanin. Only when endophilin was in large excess to synaptojanin was a slight decrease in the binding of synaptojanin to amphiphysin I or II observed, possibly due to nonspecific binding of endophilin to the amphiphysin I and II binding sites (Fig. 5). Like synaptojanin, dynamin can bind to amphiphysin I (8David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), amphiphysin II (17Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and endophilin. To determine whether these interactions can occur simultaneously, we incubated GST fusion proteins of the amphiphysin I or II SH3 domains, precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose, with a constant amount of dynamin and increasing concentrations of (His)6/endophilin. As was the case for synaptojanin, the formation of a complex of endophilin and dynamin with either amphiphysin isoform was observed (Fig. 5). At high concentrations of endophilin, the amount of bound endophilin reached saturation. At the highest concentration of endophilin (100 ॖg/ml), a decreased amount of dynamin was detected in the precipitate, probably due, as in the case of synaptojanin, to nonspecific binding of endophilin to the amphiphysin I and II binding sites. These results indicate that, like synaptojanin, dynamin interacts with its SH3-binding partners via distinct proline-rich sequences. To investigate the interactions of endophilin and the amphiphysins with synaptojanin and dynamin in situ, we performed immunoprecipitations from rat brain synaptosomes. The antiendophilin antiserum strongly immunoprecipitated endophilin (Fig. 6). Synaptojanin co-immunoprecipitated with endophilin and was similarly enriched in the precipitate compared with the starting material. Neither dynamin nor amphiphysin I or II co-immunoprecipitated with endophilin under these conditions. We then used an antiamphiphysin antiserum that recognizes amphiphysin I and II. The two amphiphysin isoforms were enriched in the immunoprecipitate (Fig. 6). Interestingly, both synaptojanin and dynamin co-immunoprecipitated with the amphiphysins, but no endophilin was detected. It thus appears that endophilin and the two amphiphysin isoforms form two separate complexes with synaptojanin in situ: endophilin with synaptojanin; amphiphysin I or II with synaptojanin and dynamin. Endophilin, a member of a novel family of three SH3 domain-containing proteins (endophilin (also known as SH3P4), SH3P8, and SH3P13) (25Sparks A.B. Hoffman N.G. McConnell S.J. Fowlkes D.M. Kay B.K. Nature Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 741-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) was recently identified as a major synaptojanin-binding partner in brain (26de Heuvel E. Bell A.W. Ramjaun A.R. Wong K. Sossin W.S. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8710-8716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Using an antipeptide antibody, we now demonstrate that endophilin is brain specific and is concentrated in synaptic terminals throughout the brain, where it colocalizes with synaptojanin, dynamin, and amphiphysin I and II (8David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar,17Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). One exception to this synaptic localization is in the mossy fiber nerve terminals in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, where neither synaptojanin, endophilin, nor dynamin is detectable, whereas common synaptic markers, such as synapsin and synaptophysin, are present at high levels. This peculiar absence or very low level of endocytic proteins is well correlated with the low firing rates of the granule cells that give rise to these terminals (35Jung M.W. McNaughton B.L. Hippocampus. 1993; 3: 165-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Moreover, the mossy fibers form large terminals, densely packed with synaptic vesicles (36Blackstad T.W. Kjaerheim A. J. Comp. Neurol. 1961; 117: 113-159Crossref Scopus (279) Google Scholar), which also implies a very low demand for endocytic restoration of the vesicle pool. Thus, the tissue and subcellular distribution of endophilin further support a role for endophilin in endocytosis. The interaction between endophilin and synaptojanin is mediated via the endophilin SH3 domain, and synaptojanin can also bind to the SH3 domains of amphiphysin I and II (8David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 17Ramjaun A.R. Micheva K.D. Bouchelet I. McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Overlay assays of synaptojanin deletion constructs revealed that endophilin and amphiphysin I interact with synaptojanin between amino acids 1061 and 1165, a region comprising several consensus SH3 domain-binding sites. One such site (PXRPXR; amino acids 1065–1070) was recently identified as the binding site for amphiphysin I on dynamin (9Grabs D. Slepnev V.I. Songyang Z. David C. Lynch M. Cantley L.C. De Camilli P.

Meanwhile, amphiphysin II was found to bind between amino acids 1165 and 1276 of synaptojanin, indicating that amphiphysin II utilizes a distinct binding site. In fact, binding experiments using purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that amphiphysin I, amphiphysin II, and endophilin can interact simultaneously with synaptojanin without competing for binding sites, suggesting that all three proteins interact at distinct sites. These observations further confirm the specificity of the SH3 domain-mediated interactions (38Sparks A.B. Rider J.E. Hoffman N.G. Fowlkes D.M. Quillam L.A. Kay B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1540-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and raise the interesting possibility of the existence in the nerve terminal of a larger protein complex formed through simultaneous interactions of several SH3 proteins with the proline-rich tail of synaptojanin. In addition to synaptojanin, endophilin was also found to bind in an SH3 domain-dependent manner to dynamin, a nerve terminal-enriched protein whose involvement in endocytosis is supported by a wealth of data (reviewed in Ref. 1De Camilli P. Takei K. McPherson P.S. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 559-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Dynamin has a proline-rich C terminus that mediates its binding to a number of SH3 domain-containing proteins in vitro, such as phopholipase Cγ, Grb2, the regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85α) (7Gout I.

However, among these potential binding partners, only amphiphysin I and II are concentrated in synaptic terminals. Recent evidence showing that disruption of the interaction between dynamin and amphiphysin I inhibits endocytosis in nerve terminals (13Shupliakov O. Löw P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) confirms the importance of the dynamin/amphiphysin I association in vivo. We have now identified another SH3 domain-binding partner for dynamin, which, like amphiphysin I and II, is enriched in nerve terminals and may also represent a physiological partner for dynamin. Furthermore, dynamin, like synaptojanin, appears to contain distinct proline-rich binding sites for its different SH3 domain partners and is able to interact simultaneously with several of these proteins. The present in vitro results reveal that the SH3 domain-containing proteins endophilin and amphiphysin I and II have the potential to bind the proline-rich regions of both synaptojanin and dynamin in vivo. To investigate the interactions between these proteins occurring in situ, we performed immunoprecipitations from crude rat brain synaptosome fractions using antiendophilin and antiamphiphysin antibodies. The results indicate that two separate and stable complexes are formed in the nerve terminal: synaptojanin with endophilin, and synaptojanin with amphiphysin I or II and dynamin. The exact nature of this second complex is still unknown. Regardless, the immunoprecipitation results give an important indication for the stable physiological interactions taking place in the nerve terminal. Meanwhile, these results do not exclude the possibility that other interactions that were observedin vitro may also take place, although such interactions might be more transient, possibly limited to certain stages of the synaptic vesicle cycle within the nerve terminal. Thus, two distinct and stable protein complexes appear to exist in the nerve terminal: amphiphysin I and II with synaptojanin and dynamin, and endophilin with synaptojanin. The amphiphysin-containing complex is well suited for targeting of synaptojanin and dynamin to sites of endocytosis. For example, amphiphysin I binds to the plasmalemmal clathrin adaptor protein AP2 (8David C. McPherson P.S. Mundigl O. De Camilli P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

McPherson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16700-16706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). It is, indeed, known that the SH3 domain-mediated interaction between amphiphysin I and dynamin is essential for recruiting dynamin to clathrin-coated pits (12Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S.

Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). By a similar mechanism, amphiphysin I and/or II may also participate in the targeting of synaptojanin. Once at clathrin-coated pits, synaptojanin, through its 5-phosphatase activity (21McPherson P.S. Garcia E.P. Slepnev V.I. David C. Zhang X. Grabs D. Sossin W.S. Bauerfeind R. Nemoto Y. De Camilli P.

Alternatively, synaptojanin could function in the regulation of phospholipase D activity and the formation of phosphatidic acid (41Chung J.-K. Sekiya F. Kang H.-S. Lee C. Han J.-S. Kim S.R. Bae Y.S.

Itoh T. Miura K. Takenawa T. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3841-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Less is known about the possible roles of the endophilin/synaptojanin complex. This complex might serve to regulate the amount of synaptojanin at the sites of endocytosis by limiting the pool of synaptojanin available for interaction with the amphiphysin isoforms. Alternatively, endophilin might not simply buffer excess synaptojanin but rather actively target it to other sites within the neuron, possibly through its central domain, which has a high probability of participating in coiled-coil interactions. Synaptojanin, dynamin, and amphiphysin I are known to undergo dephosphorylation upon nerve terminal depolarization (20McPherson P.S. Takei K. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. J. Biol.

To investigate how Tec regulates c-fos transcription, we have searched for Tec-interacting proteins (TIPs) by using yeast two-hybrid screening and have identified seven TIPs. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel protein, TIP3. The predicted TIP3 protein contains one Src homology (SH) 2 domain with the highest similarity to that of mouse CIS (18Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). In the reconstitution system in 293 cells, TIP3 was shown to bind to Tec and suppress its activity. We could further reveal that TIP3 is a negative regulator of Jak2.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify signaling molecules acting downstream of Tec, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen in which human Tec kinase domain (amino acids 357–630) was used as a bait to identify TIPs. From the cDNA library of human B-cells transformed by Epstein-Barr virus, we could isolate one cDNA group, the product (TIP3) of which can interact with the Tec kinase domain in yeast cells. Northern blot analysis with the TIP3 cDNA probe revealed that a human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-dependent cell line, UT-7, expresses the TIP3 message of about 1.3 kilobases long (not shown). Therefore, we tried to isolate full-length TIP3 cDNAs from a conventional cDNA library of UT-7 cells constructed in the λZAPII phage vector, and the nucleotide sequence of the longest cDNA obtained is shown in Fig.1. The cDNA has a long open reading frame that encodes a novel protein of 211 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 23,551. The predicted TIP3 protein has an SH2 domain in the central area with a similarity (417) to that of mouse CIS protein, and the homology between TIP3 and CIS further extends into the COOH-terminal regions (297 homologous). Therefore, TIP3 together with CIS may form a novel subfamily of signaling molecules.TIP3 contains a potential 舠PEST舡 sequence (23Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar) in the NH2-terminal region (amino acids 23–37). We have indeed encountered a difficulty to abundantly express TIP3 in 293 cell (and even in insect cells). Addition of a GST tag to the NH2terminus of TIP3 enabled us to reproducibly express TIP3 to a moderate level in mammalian cells. Therefore, in most experiments described below, we used pGST-HIV-TIP3 expression plasmid, which produces TIP3 with an NH2-terminal tag of GST plus HIV gp120 epitope (Fig. 2 A). To examine whether TIP3 can bind to Tec in mammalian cells, pGST-HIV-TIP3 was introduced into 293 cells with or without the expression plasmids of Tec. GST-HIV-TIP3 was precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose beads and immunoblotted with anti-Tec serum. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2 B, Tec could be identified in the TIP3 precipitates irrespective of the Tec activity. Because our anti-Tec serum was raised against the GST-Tec SH3 fusion protein, the serum can recognize GST as well as Tec. Therefore, GST-HIV-TIP3 was simultaneously identified by the serum in the same blot, demonstrating that a similar amount of GST-HIV-TIP3 protein was precipitated in each fraction. Expression of Tec in each fraction was also verified by probing the total cell lysates with anti-Tec serum (Fig. 2 B,lower panel). To determine which domain of TIP3 is responsible for the binding to Tec, GST, GST-HIV-TIP3, GST-HIV-TIP3Δ1 (lacking the COOH-terminal 39 residues), or GST-HIV-TIP3Δ2 (lacking the COOH-terminal 129 residues) was expressed in 293 cells with Tec. GST or GST-HIV-TIP3 derivatives were precipitated and probed with anti-Tec serum (upper panel of Fig. 2 C). Deletion of the SH2 and COOH-terminal domains could not block the binding between TIP3 and Tec, suggesting that the NH2-terminal region of TIP3 is responsible for the binding to Tec. Again, the precipitated GST-HIV-TIP3 and its derivatives were identified by the serum in the same blot (Fig. 2 C, middle panel). Appropriate expression of Tec in each set was confirmed as in Fig.2 B (lower panel).Figure 2TIP3 binds to Tec and suppresses its kinase activity in cells. A, schematic representation of TIP3 and its derivatives used in this study. TIP3 constructs were tagged at the NH2 terminus with GST (hatched oval) plus the HIV gp120 epitope (closed diamond) or His6(open oval) plus the HIV epitope. The first and the last amino acids of the fragments are numbered with respect to their positions in the full-length TIP3. B, GST-HIV-TIP3 associates with Tec in 293 cells. GST (G) or GST-HIV-TIP3 (G·TIP) was expressed in 2 × 106 of 293 cells without or with Tec (T) or kinase-inactive TecKM (T M ; Lys-397 in the ATP binding site of Tec is replaced with Met) as indicated at the top. GST and GST-HIV-TIP3 were purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads from the cells lysed by the 0.17 lysis buffer, separated through 7.57 SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with anti-Tec serum (Glutathione beads). The serum could simultaneously recognize Tec and GST-HIV-TIP3 (indicated at the right). Total cell lysates (10 ॖg/lane) of the same set were also probed with anti-Tec serum to estimate the expression level of Tec in each fraction (TCL). C, the NH2 domain of TIP3 is required for the binding to Tec. In 2 × 106 of 293 cells, Tec (T), GST (G), GST-HIV-TIP3 (G·TIP), GST-HIV-TIP3Δ1 (G·TIPΔ1), or GST-HIV-TIP3Δ2 (G·TIPΔ2) were expressed in the various combinations as indicated at the top. Cells were lysed by the 0.17 lysis buffer, and GST or the GST-TIP3 derivatives were purified from each fraction by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Glutathione beads). The precipitates were immunoblotted with anti-Tec serum, which reacted with Tec and GST-TIP3 derivatives (indicated at the right). Total cell lysates (10 ॖg/lane) of the same sample set were also blotted with anti-Tec serum to estimate the expression level of Tec in each fraction (TCL). D, TIP3 suppresses the tyrosine phosphorylation of Tec. Tec was immunoprecipitated from 293 cells expressing Tec (T) with GST (G), GST-HIV-TIP3 (G·TIP), GST-HIV-TIP3Δ1 (G·TIPΔ1), or GST-HIV-TIP3Δ2 (G·TIPΔ2) and immunoblotted with αP-Tyr Ab (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). In the bottom panel, the same membrane was reprobed with anti-Tec serum (αTec) to estimate the amounts of Tec protein precipitated. E, TIP3 suppresses the kinase activity of Tec. Tec was immunoprecipitated from the same set of 293 cells as in D and incubated in the kinase buffer with [γ-32P]ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. Autophosphorylation of pp70 Tec is shown (KA). Total cell lysates (10 ॖg/lane) of the same set were blotted with anti-Tec serum, demonstrating the expression level of Tec in each fraction (αTec).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next tested whether TIP3 can regulate the tyrosine phosphorylation or kinase activity of Tec. Tec was expressed in 293 cells with or without GST-HIV-TIP3 and its deletion mutants, immunoprecipitated, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (αP-Tyr Ab). As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 2 D, co-expression of GST-HIV-TIP3 suppressed the tyrosine phosphorylation of Tec. Truncation of the COOH-terminal domain in TIP3 further enhanced this suppressive effect (T+G·TIPΔ1 lane). Although GST-HIV-TIP3Δ2 could still decrease the phosphotyrosine contents of Tec (T+G·TIPΔ2 lane), the effect was less prominent compared with that of GST-HIV-TIP3Δ1. The membrane was reblotted with anti-Tec serum to show that equivalent amounts of Tec were precipitated (Fig.2 D, lower panel). The same set of anti-Tec immunoprecipitates was also subjected to an in vitro kinase assay to directly estimate the effect of TIP3 on the Tec activity. Consistent with the result of αP-Tyr Ab blotting, co-expression of GST-HIV-TIP3 decreased the autophosphorylation activity of Tec (upper panel of Fig. 2 E).Is TIP3 a negative regulator specific to Tec or common to other PTKs? To address this issue, Lyn was co-expressed in 293 cells with GST-HIV-TIP3. Probing the anti-Lyn immune complexes with αP-Tyr Ab demonstrated that phosphorylation of Lyn is not suppressed by TIP3 (data not shown). Surprisingly, however, TIP3 expression could decrease the phosphotyrosine contents of Jak2 (Fig.3 A). In contrast to the TIP3-Tec interaction, truncation of the COOH-terminal domain did not enhance the suppressive effect of TIP3 (J+G·TIPΔ1 lane). Further deletion of the SH2 domain relieved the suppression of Jak2 phosphorylation to some extent (J+G·TIPΔ2 lane). Thus, the SH2 domain of TIP3 should be involved in the regulation of Jak2 phosphorylation. The same membrane was reprobed with anti-Jak2 serum to estimate the amount of Jak2 precipitated (lower panel). The effect of TIP3 expression on the Jak2 activity was assessed by anin vitro kinase assay. In accordance with the phosphotyrosine contents, co-expression of TIP3 suppressed the kinase activity of Jak2 (Fig. 3 B) but not that of Lyn (not shown). Because both of GST-HIV-TIP3 and Jak2 nonspecifically bound to protein A-Sepharose beads and glutathione-Sepharose beads, we could not test the physical interaction of these two molecules in the reconstitution system in 293 cells. Instead, Jak2 and TIP3 were expressed in the insect cell system. The recombinant baculovirus expressing His-HIV-TIP3 (see Fig. 2 A) was used to infect Sf21 cells derived fromSpodoptera frugiperda, either alone or in combination with the virus expressing Jak2 or kinase-dead Jak2KE in which Lys-882 at the ATP-binding site is replaced with Glu. Jak2 was immunoprecipitated from each fraction and probed with anti-HIV tag antibody (H902), showing that TIP3 can interact with Jak2 in insect cells (upper panel of Fig. 3 C). However, in contrast to the Tec-TIP3 interaction, Jak2KE could not bind to TIP3, suggesting that Jak2 associates with TIP3 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Appropriate expression of Jak2 and TIP3 in each set was confirmed by probing the same membrane with anti-Jak2 serum (middle panel) and by probing the total cell lysates with H902 (lower panel), respectively.Figure 3TIP3 down-regulates the activity of Jak2. A, TIP3 suppresses the tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. Jak2 (J) was expressed in 2 × 106 of 293 cells with either GST (G), GST-HIV-TIP3 (G·TIP), GST-HIV-TIP3Δ1 (G·TIPΔ1), or GST-HIV-TIP3Δ2 (G·TIPΔ2), immunoprecipitated, and blotted with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (upper panel) or anti-Jak2 serum (lower panel). B, TIP3 down-regulates the activity of Jak2. Jak2 (J) was expressed in 293 cells with either GST (G) or GST-HIV-TIP3 (G·TIP). Jak2KE (J KE) was also expressed together with GST-HIV-TIP3. Jak2 was immunoprecipitated from each set by anti-Jak2 serum, incubated at 30 °C for 15 min in the kinase buffer containing the Jak2 substrate peptide (Upstate Biotechnology), and subjected to Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylation of the synthetic substrate is shown. C, TIP3 binds to Jak2 in insect cells. Recombinant baculovirus expressing Jak2 (J), Jak2KE(J KE), or His-HIV-TIP3 (TIP) was used to infect 5 × 105/ml of Sf21 cells (Invitrogen) at multiplicity of infection of 1.0 in the combinations indicated at thetop. After 48 h of incubation, Jak2 was immunoprecipitated from the cells lysed by the 0.17 lysis buffer and blotted with either H902 (upper panel) or anti-Jak2 serum (middle panel). Total cell lysates (10 ॖg/lane) of the same sample set were also probed with H902 (lower panel). D, TIP3 blocks the tyrosine phosphorylation of the GM-CSF receptor ॆc chain. GM-CSF receptor ॆc chain (ॆ c) was expressed in 293 cells either alone or with Jak2 (J) or Jak2 plus His-HIV-TIP3 (TIP). The ॆc chain was immunoprecipitated from each set and blotted with either αP-Tyr Ab or anti-ॆc serum (αॆ c).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is widely known that Jak kinases can phosphorylate the tyrosine residues of cytokine receptors (24Ihle J.N. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 60: 1-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We thus tested whether co-expression of TIP3 suppresses this Jak2-mediated phosphorylation of the ॆc chain of human GM-CSF receptor. The ॆc chain was expressed in 293 cells either alone or in combination with Jak2 or Jak2 plus His-HIV-TIP3. The ॆcchain was immunoprecipitated from the cells and blotted with αP-Tyr Ab. As shown in the upper panel of Fig. 3 D, Jak2 could phosphorylate the ॆc chain in cells, but this effect was abolished by the co-expression of TIP3. Therefore, TIP3 should modulate the Jak2-mediated signalings in vivo.One of the initial aims of this study was to identify signaling molecules involved in the c-fos regulation pathway. We therefore tested whether TIP3 can modulate the cytokine-driven c-fos activation mechanism. The pfos/luc reporter plasmid in which expression of luciferase is controlled by the c-fos promoter was introduced into IL-3-dependent BA/F3 cells by electroporation together with pSRα or the pSRα-based expression plasmid of Syk, Tec, or nontagged TIP3. After incubation with or without IL-3, cells were lysed and subjected to luciferase assay (Fig.4 A). Stimulation of the vector-transfected BA/F3 cells with IL-3 could elevate the reporter activity. Introduction of Syk did not significantly affect the c-fos promoter activity, making it unlikely that Syk mediates c-fos activation in blood cells. Expression of Tec, however, could strongly enhance the luciferase activity both in the unstimulated and the IL-3-stimulated states. On the contrary, TIP3 almost abolished the IL-3-driven activation of the c-fospromoter. We then tested whether TIP3 can suppress the Tec-driven c-fos activation. As shown in Fig. 4 B, co-introduction of TIP3 could significantly suppress the Tec-mediated activation of the c-fos promoter. Similarly, expression of TIP3 strongly suppressed the Jak2-driven c-fos activation in BA/F3 cells (not shown).Figure 4TIP3 negatively regulates the c-fos promoter. A, TIP3 suppresses the c-fos promoter activity in BA/F3 cells. 10 ॖg of pSRα (Vector) or the pSRα-based expression plasmid of Syk, Tec, or TIP3 were introduced into 1 × 107 of BA/F3 cells together with the pfos/luc reporter plasmid (2 ॖg of each). Luciferase activities were assayed in the samples from the BA/F3 cells without (no factor) or with the stimulation of 25 units/ml of IL-3 (+IL-3). The mean value ± S.D. of the luciferase activities in triplicate samples from each fraction is shown as arbitrary units. B, TIP3 suppresses the Tec-driven activation of the c-fos promoter. pSRα (Vector) or the pSRα-based expression plasmid of Tec or nontagged TIP3 was introduced into BA/F3 cells in the combinations indicated at thebottom. Total amounts of plasmid DNAs in each set of electroporation were adjusted to be equal by adding appropriate amounts of pSRα DNA. BA/F3 cells with (+IL-3) or without (no factor) the IL-3 stimulation were subjected to the luciferase assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Without the GST-tag, TIP3 expression in 293 cells was low and varied from experiment to experiment. Phosphorylation of Tec could not always be suppressed in cells by those amounts of TIP3. However, even with the nontagged TIP3, we could reproducibly observe the suppression of kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation of Jak2. Thus, TIP3 should have a higher binding affinity to Jak2 than to Tec, and Jak2 may be the major target of TIP3 in vivo. We also observed that cytokine stimulation induces the TIP3 transcription in cytokine-dependent hematopoietic cells (not shown). TIP3 might play as a physiological 舠brake舡 against overgrowth of blood cells, probably, via down-regulating the PTK activities. After submission of this manuscript, identification of TIP3 molecule has been reported by other groups under the name of SOCS-1 (25Starr R. Willson T.A. Viney E.M. Murray L.J.L. Rayner J.R.

Many members of this family are abundantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues, and Tec has been shown to be involved in the intracellular signaling systems of a wide range of cytokines including interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, stem cell factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, erythropoietin, and thrombopoietin (9Mano H.

In addition to cytokine receptors, recent studies have indicated that other cell surface receptors on lymphocytes, such as CD28 (15August A. Gibson S. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Mills G.B. Dupont B.

Do they participate specifically in cell growth mechanism of blood cells, differentiation mechanism, or both? What kind of signaling molecules do they interact with in vivo? We have recently revealed that transient introduction of Tec into an IL-3-dependent cell line, BA/F3 (17Palacious R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), resulted in marked elevation of the promoter activity of the c-fosproto-oncogene and that introduction of kinase-dead Tec suppressed the IL-3-driven activation of the c-fos promoter, suggesting that Tec is directly involved in the cytokine-driven activation mechanism of c-fosproto-oncogene. 2Y.

To investigate how Tec regulates c-fos transcription, we have searched for Tec-interacting proteins (TIPs) by using yeast two-hybrid screening and have identified seven TIPs. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel protein, TIP3. The predicted TIP3 protein contains one Src homology (SH) 2 domain with the highest similarity to that of mouse CIS (18Yoshimura A. Ohkubo T. Kiguchi T. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Hara T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2816-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). In the reconstitution system in 293 cells, TIP3 was shown to bind to Tec and suppress its activity. We could further reveal that TIP3 is a negative regulator of Jak2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONTo identify signaling molecules acting downstream of Tec, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen in which human Tec kinase domain (amino acids 357–630) was used as a bait to identify TIPs. From the cDNA library of human B-cells transformed by Epstein-Barr virus, we could isolate one cDNA group, the product (TIP3) of which can interact"

Platelet aggregation depends upon the binding of adhesive proteins to integrin αIIbॆ3 on the platelet surface. In the present study, a novel interface between the blood coagulation system and platelets is demonstrated by showing that 1) prothrombin binds to αIIbॆ3 and 2) this interaction accelerates prothrombin activation. Prothrombin bound to purified αIIbॆ3 in a specific, saturable, and divalent cation-dependent manner. This interaction was inhibited by certain monoclonal antibodies to αIIbॆ3, by the αIIbॆ3 ligands fibrinogen and RGD peptides, but not by thrombin or unrelated proteins. Prothrombin also interacted with αIIbॆ3 on resting and stimulated platelets as demonstrated by soluble ligand binding and platelet adhesion assays. Activation of prothrombin by Factor Xa alone or Factor Xa-Va was accelerated by αIIbॆ3, and this enhancement was blocked by a monoclonal antibody that inhibited prothrombin binding to the receptor. Taken together, these data identify a previously unrecognized linkage between platelets and the blood coagulation system that may have a significant regulatory consequence.

Taken together, these data identify a previously unrecognized linkage between platelets and the blood coagulation system that may have a significant regulatory consequence. The blood coagulation cascade and platelets collaborate to mediate thrombus formation and maintain homeostasis. Both arms of the hemostatic system must be functional to prevent excessive blood loss at sites of vascular injury. Linkages between the platelet and coagulation pathways are multifaceted and necessary to achieve efficient thrombus formation. Several examples of such networking are relevant to the present study. Thrombin, formed in the blood coagulation system, converts fibrinogen to fibrin, the major protein component of the hemostatic plug, and thrombin also is a major physiological and potent activator of platelets. Fibrinogen not only forms fibrin but also aggregates platelets by engaging its receptor, integrin αIIbॆ3. Platelets influence thrombin generation by providing a surface for assembly of the prothrombinase complex, consisting of the zymogen, prothrombin, Factor Xa, Factor Va, and phospholipid. Recently, Reverter et al. (1Reverter J.C. Beguin S. Kessels H. Kumar R. Hemker H.C. Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) identified a previously unrecognized linkage between the blood coagulation system and platelets by showing that certain antiplatelet agents could inhibit thrombin generation. These agents included a chimeric monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LIBS, ligand-induced binding sites; PPACK, d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-arginine chloromethylketone; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate. 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; BSA, bovine serum albumin; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; LIBS, ligand-induced binding sites; PPACK, d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-arginine chloromethylketone; PMA, phorbol myristate acetate. 7E3, which binds to αIIbॆ3 (and αVॆ3), blocks ligand binding to this receptor and is currently being used as an antithrombotic drug in humans (2EPIC Investigators N.

Moreover, thrombin generation in the presence of platelets from patients with Glanzmann's thrombasthenia, a congenital deficiency of αIIbॆ3, was also reduced compared with normal platelets (1Reverter J.C.

Blood. 1997; 89: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that αIIbॆ3 can influence prothrombin activation, but the molecular mechanism for this effect was undetermined. In the present study, we provide a potential basis for the influence of αIIbॆ3 on thrombin formation. Noting that prothrombin contains an RGD sequence within its catalytic domain (9Magnusson S. Petersen T.E. Sottrup-Jensen L. Claeys H. Reich E. Rifkin D. Shaw E. Proteases and Biological Control. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1975: 123-149Google Scholar), we considered whether the zymogen could be a ligand for the receptor. A specific and saturable interaction of the zymogen but not thrombin itself is demonstrated. Furthermore, binding of prothrombin to the receptor is shown to accelerate thrombin formation. These data identify a novel and potentially important linkage between platelets and the blood coagulation system. GRGDSP peptide was prepared as described (10D'Souza S.E. Ginsberg M.H. Lam S.C.-T. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3943-3951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cyclic RGD peptide, KYGC(s-s)RGDWPC(s-s), was synthesized by the same method and cyclized with potassium ferricyanide (11Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L.

The peptides were purified to homogeneity by high pressure liquid chromatography using a C18 Vydac column and characterized by amino acid composition. Bovine serum albumin (BSA; fraction V, crystalline) was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). Human prothrombin, purchased from Alexis Corp (San Diego, CA), was more 997 pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). The preparations used contained only one major Coomassie Blue staining band, and this protein reacted with mAb to prothrombin (Biodesign International, Kennebunk, ME) in Western blots. Human thrombin with a specific activity of >1000 NIH units/mg protein was from Alexis Corp. Factor Xa with specific activity of 1029 plasma equivalent units/mg protein and Spectrozyme TH, the chromogenic substrate used to measure the amidolytic activity of thrombin, were purchased from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT). mAb 7E3 (13Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Barry S. Coller, (Mt.

FITC goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased fromZymed Laboratories (South San Francisco, CA). Fibrinogen was purified from fresh human plasma by differential ethanol precipitation (15Plow E.F. Srouji A.H. Meyer D. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5388-5391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). αIIbॆ3 was purified from octylglucoside extracts of human platelets by affinity chromatography using a KYGRGDP-Sepharose column followed by elution with excess RGD-containing peptide (4Pytela R. Pierschbacher M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1986; 231: 1559-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). The preparations used exhibited only two major bands corresponding to the αIIb and ॆ3 subunits and did not react with mAb LM609, indicative of negligible αVॆ3 contamination. For some experiments, thrombin was inactivated by treatment with a 10-fold molar excess of d-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl-arginine chloromethylketone (PPACK). All proteins were >997 pure as judged by SDS-PAGE and protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Na125I (specific activity = 15–17 mCi 125I/mg of iodine) from Amersham Life Science, Inc. was used for radioiodination. Fibrinogen and prothrombin were radiolabeled using a modified chloramine-T method (15Plow E.F. Srouji A.H. Meyer D. Marguerie G. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5388-5391Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled prothrombin was not distinguishable from the unlabeled form upon SDS-PAGE under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Iodinated prothrombin was stored at 4 °C and used within 3 days of labeling. The binding of prothrombin and fibrinogen to immobilized αIIbॆ3 was performed as described by Charoet al. (16Charo I.F.

Chem. 1991; 266: 1415-1421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. αIIbॆ3 (125 ॖg/ml) was diluted 1:25 in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4 (Buffer A) and immobilized onto 96-well microtiter plates (Corning Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) at 500 ng/well for 18 h at 4 °C. The plates were then washed and post-coated with 40 mg/ml BSA overnight at 4 °C. Radiolabeled mAb CRC64 specific for αIIbॆ3(14Mazurov A.V. Khaspekova S.G. Byzova T.V. Tikhomirov O.Y. Berndt M.C. Steiner B. Kouns W.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) was used to quantitate the amount of immobilized receptor per well. At saturation, 5.6 × 1010 ± 0.4 × 1010 molecules of CRC64 bound to the αIIbॆ3-coated wells. The functional activity of the immobilized αIIbॆ3 was assessed on the basis of 125I-fibrinogen binding. At saturation, 4 × 1010 ± 0.32 × 1010fibrinogen molecules bound per well. Thus, most of the bound receptor was capable of interacting with fibrinogen. 125I-Prothrombin was added in Buffer A containing 2 mg/ml BSA and the selected divalent cations (1 mmCa2+ unless otherwise specified). After incubation for selected times (150–180 min) at 37 °C, wells were washed four or five times with Buffer A, and bound prothrombin was quantitated by counting the bound radioactivity in a γ-counter. The bound prothrombin was eluted and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, autoradiography, and Western blotting using prothrombin specific mAbs. No difference between nonlabeled prothrombin, labeled prothrombin and eluted prothrombin was found. In some experiments, αIIbॆ3-coated wells were preincubated for 20 min with mAbs, peptides, or proteins prior to the addition of 125I-prothrombin. Nonspecific binding was measured in the presence of a 40-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Prothrombin binding to wells, coated by BSA, served as an additional negative control. Data were determined as the means of triplicate or quadruplicate measurements at each experimental point. Platelets, isolated by differential centrifugation followed by gel filtration (18Plow E.F. McEver R.-P. Coller B.S. Woods V.L. Marguerie G.A. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1985; 66: 724-727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were suspended at 1 × 108/ml in modified Tyrode's buffer, containing 0.17 BSA, 1 mmCaCl2 or 10 mm EDTA. Platelets were preincubated with mAb 7E3 (20 mg/ml), nonimmune immunoglobulins (20 ॖg/ml), or fibrinogen (1 ॖm) for 20 min, and125I-prothrombin was then added at selected concentrations. After 1.5 h at room temperature, platelet-bound ligand was separated by centrifugation through 207 sucrose for 2.5 min at 22 °C in Beckman microfuge, and the cell-bound radioactivity was measured in a γ-counter. For some experiments, the platelets were activated with phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) at 400 nm or with ADP at 10 ॖm for 15 min. Thrombin was used to activate platelets at 0.1 unit/ml, and 3 mm PPACK was added 10 min later. Isolated platelets were suspended at 1 × 108/ml in modified Tyrode's buffer containing 0.17 BSA, 1 mm CaCl2, 3 ॖg/ml prostaglandin I2, and 2 mm PPACK (Buffer B) and incubated with prothrombin (100 ॖg/ml), cyclic RGD peptide (50 ॖm), or with no additions for 60 min at room temperature.

After 30 min, the platelets were washed by centrifugation in Buffer B, incubated with FITC-goat anti-mouse IgG on ice for 20 min, and then analyzed by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry was performed using a FACScan instrument (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA); 10,000 events were recorded; and the data were analyzed using the CellQuest software program (version 1.2). Platelets were labeled in platelet-rich plasma with 51Cr (specific activity 100 cpm/1000 platelets) as described (20Piotrowicz R.S. Orchekowski R.P. Nugent D.J. Yamada K.Y. Kunicki T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 1359-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The radiolabeled platelets were then isolated as described above and suspended at 5 × 107/ml in modified Tyrode's buffer containing 0.27 BSA and 1 mm CaCl2. The platelet suspension (100 ॖl) was added into microtiter wells, which had been coated with prothrombin at a concentration of 10 ॖg/ml and post-coated with BSA (30 mg/ml). After 90 min at 37 °C, the wells were washed four or five times with Tyrode's buffer, and adherent cells were quantitated by counting the bound radioactivity in a ॆ-counter. Nonspecific platelet adhesion was defined as the radioactivity bound to wells coated only with BSA, and this value was subtracted in the reported results. αIIbॆ3 was immobilized onto 96-well microtiter plates as described above. After post-coating with BSA, prothrombin was added at concentrations of 20–50 mg/ml. mAb 7E3 (20 ॖg/ml) was used to inhibit prothrombin binding to the receptor, and nonspecific mouse IgG at the same concentration served as control. After selected incubation times in the presence of 1 mmCa2+ to allow binding to the immobilized receptor, prothrombin activation was initiated by addition of 2 ॖg/ml Factor Xa or a mixture of 2 ॖg/ml Factor Xa and 2 ॖg/ml Factor Va. Thrombin generation was assayed at 37 °C by measuring the amidolytic activity of thrombin in samples removed after 12 min for Factor Xa-induced activation or 6 min for Factors Xa-Va-induced activation. These samples (10 ॖl) were added to the prewarmed (37 °C) thrombin chromogenic substrate, Spectrozyme TH (100 ॖl), at a final concentration of 0.5 mm in 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris/HCl, 0.057 BSA (w/v), 20 mm EDTA, pH 7.9. The release of free chromophore (p-nitroanilide-diacetate) from substrate was monitored as a function of time at 405 nm in a Molecular Devices microplate reader. The means of V max obtained using the Softmax program were used to calculate the thrombin concentration. Thrombin of a known specific activity was used as a calibrator. The means ± S.D. of quadruplicate measurements are expressed as the molar concentration of thrombin generated or as the percentage of increase above samples added to wells with no receptor but otherwise treated in an identical fashion. Thrombin generation was also quantified in the following manner. Prothrombin was incubated in wells coated with αIIbॆ3 in the presence of mAb 7E3 (20 ॖg/ml) or the same concentration of mouse IgG. After 3 h of incubation, Spectrozyme TH was added to each well to a final concentration of 25 mm, and then prothrombin activation was initiated by addition of 2 ॖg/ml Factor Xa. The changes of absorbance were monitored using Molecular Devices microplate reader. The means ± S.D. were calculated using the programs Excel and Sigmaplot. For curve fitting the program Sigmaplot was used. In view of the evidence linking thrombin generation and αIIbॆ3 on platelets (1Reverter J.C. Beguin S. Kessels H. Kumar R. Hemker H.C. Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 8Weiss H.J. Lages B. Blood. 1997; 89: 1599-1611Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we sought to determine whether prothrombin could bind directly to the receptor. For these analyses, prothrombin was radiolabeled to a specific activity of 5 × 106cpm/ॖg. When characterized by SDS-PAGE, the radiolabeled prothrombin migrated as a single major band with the same mobility as nonlabeled prothrombin (Fig. 1 B). The direct interaction of 125I-prothrombin with purified αIIbॆ3 from platelets was then evaluated by immobilizing the receptor on microtiter plate wells, a system utilized in numerous studies of this integrin (16Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Smith J.W. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2795-2800Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 17Charo I.F. Nannizzi L. Phillips D.R. Hsu M.A. Scarborough R.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 10265-10271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, a saturable interaction was observed. At the highest concentration of 125I-prothrombin added (200 ॖg/ml), a 40-fold excess of nonlabeled prothrombin inhibited binding by >857. By comparison, 125I-prothrombin binding to immobilized BSA was minimal and similar to that observed with αIIbॆ3-coated plates in the presence of excess nonlabeled prothrombin. The stoichiometry of the maximal number of prothrombin molecules specifically bound to αIIbॆ3, defined by substrating the binding to the BSA-coated plates, to the number of immobilized αIIbॆ3 receptors, quantitated with125I-CRC64, an αIIbॆ3-specific mAb (14Mazurov A.V. Khaspekova S.G. Byzova T.V. Tikhomirov O.Y. Berndt M.C. Steiner B. Kouns W.C. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), was 1.22 (molar ratio), suggesting that each αIIbॆ3 is capable of binding a single prothrombin molecule. Two separate approaches verified that authentic prothrombin bound to αIIbॆ3. First, the radioactivity bound and eluted from the immobilized receptor had the same mobility as the added prothrombin on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, the eluted material reacted with a mAb to prothrombin (Fig. 1 B). Second, potential artifacts due to radioiodination were excluded by detecting the binding of prothrombin to αIIbॆ3 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay format with a prothrombin mAb. The absorbance developed with the prothrombin mAb was 1.352 with αIIbॆ3-coated wells compared with 0.124 when the prothrombin was added to BSA-coated wells. Typical of the binding of adhesive ligands to αIIbॆ3, the interaction of prothrombin with the receptor was cation-dependent; Ca2+ and Mn2+ supported binding, and EDTA blocked the interaction (Fig. 2 A). Three different mAbs to αIIbॆ3, 7E3, CRC64, and 10E5, which are known to block the binding of adhesive ligands to the receptor (13Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 76: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar,14Mazurov A.V. Khaspekova S.G. Byzova T.V. Tikhomirov O.Y. Berndt M.C. Steiner B. Kouns W.C.

Invest. 1983; 72: 325-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), inhibited prothrombin binding to αIIbॆ3 (Fig. 2 B). Fibrinogen, a major physiological ligand of αIIbॆ3, also inhibited prothrombin binding, but an unrelated protein, transferrin, did not (Fig. 2 B). Known peptide ligands of αIIbॆ3, GRGDSP, a potent cyclic RGD peptide (11Scarborough R.M. Naughton M.A. Teng W. Rose J.W. Phillips D.R. Nannizzi L. Arsten A. Campbell A.M. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1066-1073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the fibrinogen γ-chain peptide H12 (not shown) were effective inhibitors of prothrombin binding, whereas a control peptide had no effect (Fig. 2 B). Both prothrombin and plasminogen contain kringle domains, but plasminogen did not inhibit prothrombin binding (Fig. 2 C). In addition, thrombin did not produce significant inhibition of prothrombin binding. Taken together, this inhibitory profile is similar to that of fibrinogen and other adhesive protein ligands that bind to αIIbॆ3 via an 舠RGD recognition specificity舡 (22Suehiro K. Smith J.W. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10265-10271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The capacity of αIIbॆ3 on intact platelets to interact with prothrombin was evaluated. As shown in Fig.3 A,125I-prothrombin exhibited dose-dependent binding to washed human platelets; maximal binding was observed at the physiological concentration of 100 ॖg/ml. This binding was cation-dependent; it was supported by Ca2+ and inhibited by EDTA (Fig. 3 A). The involvement of αIIbॆ3 in the interaction was demonstrated by the capacity of mAb 7E3 to inhibit binding. The extent of inhibition by the mAb was ∼507 (Fig. 3 B). Stimulation of platelets with 400 nm phorbol myristate acetate (Fig. 3 B) or 10 ॖm ADP (not shown) did not enhance prothrombin binding to the platelets. Thrombin stimulation of the platelets did substantially increase 125I-prothrombin binding to platelets, but the increase was insensitive to αIIbॆ3 mAbs and is likely to reflect prothrombin interaction with other platelet constituents, such as newly exposed phospholipids (24Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8890-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 25Dachary-Prigent J. Freyssinet J.-M. Pasquet J.-M. Carron J.-C. Nurden A.T. Blood. 1993; 81: 2554-2565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Verifying the functional state of the platelet preparations used in these analyses,125I-fibrinogen did not bind to the resting platelet preparations but did bind to the platelets stimulated with the various agonists. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 3 B, fibrinogen did not inhibit 125I-prothrombin binding to the nonstimulated platelets, whereas it inhibited 125I-prothrombin binding to the stimulated cells by ∼507. The direct binding of prothrombin to αIIbॆ3on intact platelets was further verified by the demonstration that this ligand-induced expression of LIBS. LIBS are not expressed by αIIbॆ3 when the receptor is unoccupied but are evoked when it is occupied by a ligand with an RGD recognition specificity (19Frelinger III, A.L. Cohen I. Plow E.F.

Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12397-12402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analyses (Fig. 3 C), prothrombin induced expression of the epitope recognized by the prototypic LIBS mAb, LIBS I. The mean fluorescence intensity of the platelets increased from 17.5 (arbitrary units) in the absence of prothrombin to 40.5 in the presence of prothrombin (100 ॖg/ml). A saturating concentration (50 ॖm) of the cyclic RGD peptide induced a fluorescence signal of 79.6. Recognition of prothrombin by αIIbॆ3 on platelets also was demonstrable in adhesion assays. Platelets, radiolabeled with 51Cr, adhered specifically to immobilized prothrombin (4.3-fold increase compare with immobilized BSA). mAbs to αIIbॆ3 and GRGDSP inhibited adhesion to the immobilized ligand (Fig. 3 C). These data indicate that platelets adhere to prothrombin in an αIIbॆ3-dependent manner. A functional consequence of prothrombin binding to αIIbॆ3 was demonstrated with respect to its activation to thrombin. Initial rates of thrombin generation were measured in αIIbॆ3-coated plates in the presence of 7E3 or nonimmune mouse IgG. The results of the typical experiment are shown in Fig.4. mAb 7E3, which inhibits prothrombin binding to αIIbॆ3 (Fig. 2 B), reduced the rate of thrombin generation by 25–307. As summarized in Table I, blockade of prothrombin binding to αIIbॆ3 by 7E3 reduced thrombin generation induced by Factor Xa or by Factor Xa-Factor Va to a similar extent. Accelerated prothrombin activation by αIIbॆ3 was also noted when the chromogenic substrate was added directly to the αIIbॆ3-coated wells (not shown).Table IEffect of αIIbॆ3 on thrombin generationCatalystThrombin generated control IgmAb 7E3Inhibition1-aThrombin generated in the presence of control Ig was assigned a value of 1007.nm7Xa32.7 ± 2.624.3 ± 0.1526Xa-Va88.5 ± 668.1 ± 323αIIbॆ3-coated wells were preincubated with prothrombin (60 ॖg/ml) in the presence mAb 7E3 or control mouse IgG (20 ॖg/ml, each) for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2. Thrombin generation was initiated by adding Factor Xa (2 ॖg/ml) or Factor Xa + Factor Va (2 ॖg/ml each). After 12 min for Factor Xa-induced activation or 6 min for Factors Xa/Va-induced activation, samples were removed from the incubation mixture and added to a prewarmed chromogenic thrombin substrate, Spectrozyme TH (0.5 mm). The means ofV max determined using the program Softmax were used to calculate the thrombin concentration using thrombin of known specific activity for calibration.1-a Thrombin generated in the presence of control Ig was assigned a value of 1007. Open table in a new tab αIIbॆ3-coated wells were preincubated with prothrombin (60 ॖg/ml) in the presence mAb 7E3 or control mouse IgG (20 ॖg/ml, each) for 3 h at 37 °C in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2.

The means ofV max determined using the program Softmax were used to calculate the thrombin concentration using thrombin of known specific activity for calibration. In these kinetic analyses, only a small fraction (∼0.27; Fig.1 A) of the total prothrombin is directly bound to the receptor when the activators are added. To achieve the observed 257 receptor-mediated acceleration requires a several hundred-fold enhancement in the rate of activation of bound as compared with free prothrombin (assuming that the rate-determining step in the reaction is the direct activation of prothrombin as opposed to the release of thrombin from the receptor, the cleavage of the synthetic substrate, etc). Moreover, with intact platelets, local generation of thrombin would activate the cells to express many additional binding sites to further accelerate prothrombin activation. Thus, the binding prothrombin to αIIbॆ3 has a potential for explosive amplification of thrombin generation. Why does prothrombin but not thrombin bind to αIIbॆ3? As a speculation, the RGD sequence at residues 187–189 within the thrombin region of prothrombin may be exposed in the zymogen and mediate binding to αIIbॆ3 but may not be surface-oriented in thrombin (27Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). This RGD sequence is proximal to the active site residue of thrombin, Ser195. Based on the crystal structure of α-thrombin (28Rydel T.J. Tulinsky A. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 583-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 29Bode W. Turk D. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), the side chain of Arg187 is exposed at the hydrated surface of the molecule, but the carboxylate side chain of Asp189 lies at the bottom of the S1 specificity pocket (27Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thromb. Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Thus, the RGD sequence is unlikely to be available for the interaction with receptors such as the ॆ3 integrins. However, this segment resides in a different orientation in crystal structure of the prothrombin activation intermediate, prethrombin 2 (30Vijayalakshmi J. Padmanabhan K.P. Mann K.G. Tulinsky A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2254-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Therefore, the RGD sequence may be available for interactions with integrins in prothrombin as well as certain intermediate products formed during its conversion to thrombin. In agreement with this hypothesis are data that some cleavage fragments of prothrombin can support RGD-dependent cell adhesion (31Bar-Shavit R. Ginzburg Y. Maoz M. Vlodavsky I. Peretz T. Isr. J. Med. Sci. 1995; 31: 86-94PubMed Google Scholar), whereas thrombin must be denatured to exhibit such activity (32Bar-Shavit R. Sabbah V. Lampugnani M.G. Marchisio P.C. Fenton II, J.W. Vlodavsky I. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 1212: 335-344Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Mutational analyses of the RGD sequence in prothrombin offers an approach to test this hypothesis. However, because the RGD sequence resides proximal to the active site of thrombin, the enzymatic potential of such prothrombin mutants may be compromised. Several corollaries arise from this hypothesis. First, depending upon the exposure of the RGD sequence, certain prothrombin activation intermediates may bind well to αIIbॆ3 and others may not. Such differential interactions with αIIbॆ3 may influence the pathways of prothrombin activation (33Bovill E.G. Tracy R.P. Hayes T.E. Jenny R.J. Bhushan F.H. Mann K.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Second, because several integrins recognize RGD sequences (34Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1996; 12: 697-715Crossref Scopus (2488) Google Scholar), prothrombin binding may not be restricted to αIIbॆ3. Our preliminary studies indicate that prothrombin also can bind to αVॆ3. This particular interaction could have a significant impact on prothrombin activation on the surface of the endothelium. Third, a pathway in which a zymogen, in this case prothrombin, binds to an integrin and is released to the local cell surface environment upon activation, in this case thrombin, to potentially react with other receptors may be a common mechanism for control of protease activity. There is an another example of an integrin that can bind a zymogen and amplify its activation. This scenario applies to Factor X, which binds to αMॆ2 (Mac-1, CD11b/CD18) on monocytic/myeloid cells and supports the cell-associated formation of factor Xa (35Altieri D.C. Edgington T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 7007-7015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Altieri D.C. Morrissey J.H. Edgington T.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7462-7466Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In the study of Reverter et al. (1Reverter J.C. Beguin S. Kessels H. Kumar R. Hemker H.C. Coller B.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 863-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), the acceleration of prothrombin activation by αIIbॆ3 on platelets was measured in fibrinogen-depleted plasma, i.e.in the absence of an abundant ligand for αIIbॆ3. Because fibrinogen only binds with high affinity to activated αIIbॆ3, we anticipated that fibrinogen would be an effective competitor of prothrombin binding to activated but not to nonstimulated platelets, and the data supported this prediction. These observations raise the possibility that the circulating platelet may be pre-armed with a small amount of prothrombin bound to αIIbॆ3. This bound prothrombin might serve as a primary target for initial activation by the Factor Xa-Va complex, which assembles on the platelet surface. As thrombin is formed, it is released from αIIbॆ3 and can stimulate the platelet to amplify the cell's prothrombin binding capacity by exposing new phospholipid binding sites. Because the αIIbॆ3 becomes activated as a result of platelet stimulation, whether unoccupied or occupied by residual prothrombin, it would bind fibrinogen or other available ligands to support the adhesive functions of the platelet. Thus, prothrombin binding to αIIbॆ3 may play an important physiological role in the early events of thrombus formation. Consistent with this postulated functional role, the RGD sequence is evolutionarily conserved (37Banfield D.K. MacGillivray R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2779-2783Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)."

Since all three subunits are required for maximal hENaC function, it has been hypothesized that the subunits interact to form a multimeric channel complex. In addition, genetic studies of the degenerins suggest that mechanosensory function and dominant neurodegeneration require three gene products (14Chalfie M. Wolinsky E. Nature. 1990; 345: 410-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 15Driscoll M. Chalfie M. Nature. 1991; 349: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 16Huang M. Chalfie M.

First, do the hENaC subunits interact with each other and with themselves? Second, which parts of an hENaC subunit are necessary for channel function and which are responsible for interactions with other subunits? The cDNAs encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase, and α, ॆ, γ, αS594X, ॆR566X, γK576X hENaC (all in pMT3) are described elsewhere (4Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A.

Epitopes were introduced into full-length hENaC subunits, immediately upstream of the stop codon, using the Muta-Gene phagemid in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). The FLAG epitope (DYKDDDDK) was inserted into αhENaC (αFLAG), ॆhENaC (ॆFLAG), and γhENaC (γFLAG), and a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (YPYDVPDYA) was inserted into ॆhENaC (ॆHA) and γhENaC (γHA). In αFLAG, the FLAG epitope replaced the last 8 C-terminal residues of αhENaC. In the other tagged subunits, the epitope was inserted immediately after the most C-terminal residue. Epitope-tagged subunits were cloned into pMT3 for expression. γE518X and γD268Xwere constructed by single-stranded mutagenesis of γhENaC in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). γΔ3–53, γL54X, and γI102X were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using γhENaC as a template. In γΔ3–53, the FLAG epitope was inserted after the most C-terminal residue. γL54X and γI102X were cloned into pcDNA3 and γΔ3–53 into pMT3 for expression. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody, 12CA5, was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim, and the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody, M2, was from Eastman Kodak Co. The anti-Nα and anti-Nγ polyclonal antisera were raised against peptides corresponding to the N-terminal 20 amino acids of α and γhENaC, respectively. COS-7 cells were transfected by electroporation and grown in medium containing 10 ॖm amiloride. Two to three days post-transfection, cells were lysed at 4 °C in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 20 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 10 ॖg/ml pepstatin A) with detergent. Metabolic labeling with [35S]methionine (Amersham Corp.) was performed prior to cell lysis, as described previously (29Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. DeBerg L.G. Welsh M.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1287-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine the most appropriate method for solubilization of hENaC subunits, we tested lysis buffer with several different detergents. 17 digitonin, 17 Nonidet P-40, and radioimmunoprecipitation buffer (17 Triton X-100, 0.17 SDS, and 17 sodium deoxycholate) each effectively solubilized αFLAG, whereas 17 CHAPS and 2.57 octyl glucoside were both relatively ineffective (Fig.1 A). 17 Triton X-100, without SDS or deoxycholate, also effectively solubilized αFLAG. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 70,000 rpm at 4 °C for 30 min, then incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitations, we used 5 ॖg/ml anti-FLAG antibody, 2 ॖg/ml anti-HA antibody, or a 1:200 dilution of anti-Nγ rabbit antisera. Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated with immobilized protein A (Pierce), and precipitates were washed twice in lysis buffer with detergent, then once in lysis buffer alone. For high salt washes, precipitates were first washed three times in lysis buffer containing 500 mm NaCl and detergent. Following washes, precipitates were boiled for 5 min in sample buffer (47 SDS, 65 mmTris, pH 6.8, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 207 glycerol, and 0.0057 bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated on 87 polyacrylamide gels using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Radioactive proteins were detected by autoradiography. Western blots were blocked with 57 bovine serum albumin, and incubated first with primary antibody (2 ॖg/ml anti-FLAG or a 1:1000 dilution of anti-Nα), then with a horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody (Amersham Corp.) at a 1:10,000 dilution. Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). hENaC subunits were expressed in albino Xenopus laevis oocytes (Nasco, Fort Atkinson, WI) by nuclear injection of plasmid DNA. DNA was injected at concentrations ranging from 40 to 70 ng/ॖl. Following injection, oocytes were incubated at 18 °C in modified Barth's solution or low Na+ modified Barth's solution (23McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), then studied 1 day later. Whole-cell currents were measured using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique, as we have previously described (4Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). During recording, oocytes were bathed in frog Ringer's solution (116 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.4 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4). A maximal dose of amiloride (100 ॖm) was added directly to the bath, and amiloride-sensitive current was determined by subtracting current following amiloride application from the baseline current. Oocyte membrane proteins were isolated according to the protocol of Tuckeret al. (30Tucker S.J. Bond C.T. Herson P. Pessia M. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5866-5870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), then detected by Western blot as described above. To determine if the epitope-tagged subunits retain structural and functional integrity, we analyzed them in COS-7 cells and Xenopus oocytes. Like wild-type subunits, epitope-tagged subunits expressed in COS-7 cells were glycosylated. Following treatment of immunoprecipitated αFLAG, ॆFLAG, or γFLAG with proteinN-glycanase, the high molecular weight glycosylated form of each subunit was reduced to the low molecular weight unglycosylated form (Fig. 1 B). Fig. 1 C shows that expression of epitope-tagged subunits in Xenopus oocytes resulted in amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents that were indistinguishable from wild-type hENaC currents, suggesting that insertion of C-terminal epitope tags did not grossly disrupt hENaC structure or cell surface targeting. The epitope-tagged subunits were also functional in mammalian (Fischer rat thyroid cell) epithelia (not shown). To test the hypothesis that hENaC subunits form heteromeric complexes, we examined the interaction of hENaC subunits in transfected COS-7 cells. In these experiments, we immunoprecipitated one subunit and detected the other subunit by Western blot; this strategy allowed us to distinguish subunits despite their similar molecular weights. With the co-precipitation assay, we detected all potential heteromeric combinations of two hENaC subunits: α-ॆ, α-γ, and ॆ-γ (Fig.2). The presence of a third hENaC subunit was not required for the association of any two hENaC subunits, indicating that each subunit was able to interact with either of the other subunits. In each case, both unglycosylated and glycosylated forms of one hENaC subunit immunoprecipitated with the other subunit, suggesting that the interaction between subunits may have occurred prior to glycosylation, in the endoplasmic reticulum. When lysate from cells expressing one subunit was mixed with lysate from cells expressing another subunit, interactions were not detected. Under identical immmunoprecipitation conditions, we could not detect an interaction between αhENaC and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (not shown), suggesting that hENaC subunits did not interact nonspecifically with other transmembrane proteins. To test the strength of the heteromeric interactions, we varied the immunoprecipitation conditions; each interaction withstood all the conditions tested, including a nonionic detergent (Triton X-100) with 500 mm salt (Fig. 3,A–C).Figure 3Heteromeric interactions withstand high salt and nonionic detergents. Transfected COS-7 cells were lysed in solubilization buffer containing 17 digitonin (DG) or 17 Triton X-100 (TX). Immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer containing isotonic salt (150 mm NaCl) or high salt (500 mm NaCl), as indicated. A, cells were transfected with αFLAG and γ. γ was immunoprecipitated with anti-Nγ antibody, and αFLAG was detected by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody. B, cells were transfected with αFLAG and ॆHA. ॆHA was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, and αFLAG was detected by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody. C, cells were transfected with ॆFLAGand γ. γ was immunoprecipitated with anti-Nγ antibody, and ॆFLAG was detected by Western blot using anti-FLAG antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Xenopus oocytes, expression of αhENaC alone generates current, suggesting that α may form a homomultimer. Because expression of ॆ and γ alone fails to generate current, it is possible that those subunits do not form homomultimers. To test these possibilities we employed two different strategies. First, we tested the ability of full-length subunits to co-precipitate smaller subunits that lacked the cytoplasmic C terminus. These truncated subunits (αS594X and ॆR566X) are functional and are similar to mutant ॆ and γ subunits found in patients with Liddle's syndrome (1Shimkets R.A. Warnock D.G. Bositis C.M.

Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C terminus speeds migration on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel, allowing us to distinguish metabolically labeled αS594X and ॆR566Xfrom full-length protein. Fig.4 A shows that αFLAG co-precipitated αS594X and ॆFLAG co-precipitated ॆR566X, indicating that both α and ॆ subunits could form homomultimers. Fig. 4 also shows that αFLAG co-precipitated ॆR566X, and ॆFLAG co-precipitated αS594X, consistent with the data shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Our second strategy was to immunoprecipitate one full-length subunit with the anti-HA antibody, and then detect co-precipitating subunits with the anti-FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 4 B, ॆFLAGco-precipitated with ॆHA and γFLAGco-precipitated with γHA. These results indicated that each of the subunits can associate to form homomultimers. Therefore, the inability of ॆ and γ to generate current when expressed alone is not likely the result of an inability to associate. To define the site(s) of interaction between hENaC subunits, we deleted portions of one subunit, γhENaC, then tested those truncated γ subunits for their ability to associate with full-length αhENaC. First, we made progressive truncations from the C terminus of γ (Fig. 5 A). Deletion of the C terminus, M2, the large extracellular domain, and M1 of γ did not abolish its ability to interact with α (Fig. 5,B and C). A construct that consisted of only the cytoplasmic N terminus (γL54X) was able to precipitate α (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the N terminus of γ was sufficient for an interaction with α. Although constructs that contained M1 (γK576X, γE518X, γD268X, and γI102X) interacted with glycosylated α, we detected an interaction only between γL54X and unglycosylated α. To determine if the N terminus was necessary for an association with α, we tested γΔ3–53, a γ construct that lacked only the N terminus (Fig. 5 A). As shown in Fig. 5 D, γΔ3–53 immunoprecipitated αhENaC. This result indicated that the N terminus of γ was not required for association with α and that other sites of intersubunit association likely exist. Since some pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1-associated mutations are predicted to cause truncation of hENaC subunits (6Chang S.S. Grunder S. Hanukoglu A. Rösler A. Mathew P.M. Hanukoglu I. Schild L. Lu Y. Shimkets R.A. Nelson-Willams C. Rossier B.C. Lifton R.P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 12: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 7Strautnieks S.S. Thompson R.J. Gardiner R.M. Chung E. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we tested the ability of truncated γ subunits to contribute to a functional Na+channel complex. In Xenopus oocytes, expression of αhENaC alone produces a small amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (22McDonald F.J. Snyder P.M. McCray Jr., P.B. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: L728-L734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We previously reported that co-expression of γ with α produced larger currents, and maximal currents were obtained when all three subunits were co-expressed (23McDonald F.J. Price M.P. Snyder P.M. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C1157-C1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in the absence of αhENaC, ॆ and γ generated no amiloride-sensitive current. Fig.6 shows that coexpression of γhENaC with the α subunit increased current. However, of the truncated γ subunits, only γK576X augmented α subunit-dependent amiloride-sensitive currents. γK576X, which lacked most of the C terminus and was similar to mutant subunits found in patients with Liddle's syndrome, increased the current compared with wild-type γ. This increase in current was probably due to increased cell-surface expression of αγK576X channels, since γK576X lacked a C-terminal sequence thought to mediate endocytosis of hENaC (4Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 31Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I.

Truncated γ subunits that lacked the N terminus (γΔ3–53) or M2 (γE518X, γI102X, and γL54X) were unable to substitute for wild-type γ, indicating a functional requirement for the N terminus and M2. Moreover, co-expression of γΔ3–53 with γL54X did not reconstitute a functional γ subunit. The functional requirement for the N terminus may reflect its involvement in intersubunit associations, as we observed in the co-immunoprecipitation assay. The requirement for M2 might be explained by its contribution to the channel pore (32Waldmann R. Champigny G. Lazdunski M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11735-11737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and suggests that pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1-associated mutants that lack M2 are nonfunctional. We also used a functional assay in Xenopusoocytes to investigate interactions between α and γhENaC. Since hENaC subunits interact to form heteromeric complexes, we hypothesized that the interaction of a nonfunctional, truncated γ subunit with the hENaC channel complex might have an inhibitory effect on channel function. To promote assembly of truncated subunits into the channel complex, we expressed wild-type α, ॆ, and γ subunits with a relative overabundance of truncated γ subunits. To control for nonspecific effects on protein synthesis, some oocytes were injected with a plasmid encoding secreted alkaline phosphatase (28Swick A.G. Janicot M. Cheneval-Kastelic T. McLenithan J.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1812-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) in place of plasmids encoding truncated γ subunits. Expression secreted alkaline phosphatase does not alter the amount of current generated by coexpression of α, ॆ, and γ. As shown in Fig.7 A, γE518X, γI102X, and γL54X inhibited amiloride-sensitive current in oocytes co-expressing all three wild-type subunits. Since these constructs also co-precipitated α, their inhibitory effect was consistent with a direct interaction with the αॆγ complex, at least in part through the α subunit. To test the possibility that the inhibitory effect required the presence of ॆ or γhENaC, we expressed only wild-type αhENaC with γI102X or γL54X. In this assay as well, both γI102X and γL54X inhibited amiloride-sensitive current (Fig. 7 B). The functional effect of these constructs was consistent with the results of the co-precipitation assay, which showed that the N terminus of γhENaC was a site of interaction with α. We hypothesized that if the truncated γ subunits interacted directly with full-length subunits to form nonfunctional channel complexes, these complexes might be degraded by cellular quality control mechanisms, thereby reducing the amiloride-sensitive current. By a similar mechanism, Xenopus oocytes degrade inward rectifier K+ channels if nonfunctional channel subunits are co-expressed (30Tucker S.J. Bond C.T. Herson P. Pessia M. Adelman J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5866-5870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 C shows that oocytes co-expressing αFLAG with γI102X or γL54Xcontained much less αFLAG protein than control oocytes. This result was consistent with our hypotheses that truncated γ subunits assemble into an unstable complex with full-length subunits, and that the γ N terminus is a site of channel assembly. These studies provide both biochemical and functional data showing protein-protein interactions between hENaC subunits. Previous studies indicated that maximal hENaC function required three homologous subunits (α, ॆ, and γ), suggesting that the subunits interact to form a heteromeric channel complex. This hypothesis was confirmed by our demonstration that hENaC subunits interact with each other and with themselves. The interactions between hENaC subunits appeared to occur early in biosynthesis, prior to glycosylation. Furthermore, the interactions were relatively strong and were not disrupted by nonionic detergents or high concentrations of salt. In the assembly of some heteromeric channels, such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, interaction between specific subunits requires the presence of a third subunit, suggesting a definite order of assembly (33Gu Y. Forsayeth J.R. Verrall S. Yu X.M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 799-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 34Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found that each hENaC subunit was capable of interacting with either of the other subunits. In addition, we detected subunit associations (ॆ-γ, ॆ-ॆ, and γ-γ) that do not produce functional Na+ channels. It is possible that variation in subunit composition might be a mechanism to generate diversity in channel function and regulation. To begin to define the subunit domain(s) that participate in intersubunit associations, we performed a deletion analysis of the γ subunit and found that the γ N terminus alone could co-precipitate α. Interestingly, the γ N terminus interacted only with unglycosylated α and did not co-immunoprecipitate glycosylated α. There are a number of possible explanations. First, the precipitating antibody may not recognize the γ N terminus when it is associated with glycosylated α. Second, the γ N terminus may interact with full-length α early, then dissociate when α is glycosylated. Third, the N terminus may associate with unglycosylated α and prevent its glycosylation. While our experiments here do not address these issues, the third possibility is consistent with our experiments inXenopus oocytes, which showed an effect of the γ N terminus on α biosynthesis. Our studies of truncated γ subunits also indicated that there is not a single site that is essential for intersubunit association. This result was consistent with studies of other channels that have shown multiple sites of subunit interactions (35Tu L. Santarelli V. Sheng Z. Skach W. Pain D. Deutsch C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18904-18911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). One interesting structural feature of hENaC subunits is the large number of highly conserved extracellular cysteines, which could potentially participate in intersubunit disulfide bonds. Although these cysteines were not required for intersubunit association, it remains possible that extracellular cysteines also contribute to subunit interactions. Expression of truncated γ subunits in Xenopus oocytes identified elements of the γ subunit that are essential for function. γ subunits lacking either the N terminus or M2 were nonfunctional, even though these regions were not required for subunit association. The functional requirement for M2 may be physiologically relevant for two reasons. First, alternatively spliced αhENaC transcripts with stop codons upstream of M2 have been identified in kidney, lung, and taste tissues (36Li X.-J. Xu R.-H. Guggino W.B. Snyder S.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 1133-1140PubMed Google Scholar). Like γE518X, γI102X and γL54X, the α subunits encoded by alternatively spliced messages are nonfunctional. However, our studies suggest that alternatively spliced transcripts, if translated, could associate with full-length subunits, and thus could inhibit hENaC function. Second, our data indicate that pseudohypoaldosteronism-associated mutations that disrupt M2 in hENaC subunits may cause pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 by abolishing subunit function. In studies of other multimeric ion channels, the interaction of nonfunctional channel subunits with functional ones disrupted channel function and/or cell surface expression (30Tucker S.J. Bond C.T.

Therefore, as an additional assay of subunit interactions, we examined the functional effects of truncated γ subunits on wild-type hENaC channels. In oocytes expressing wild-type α, ॆ, and γ hENaC, or α hENaC alone, γ subunits that contained the cytoplasmic N terminus reduced the magnitude of amiloride-sensitive currents. N termini are important in the assembly of other ion channels, including voltage-gated K+ channels and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (37Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,39Verrall S. Hall Z.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 23-31Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 40Shen N.V. Chen X.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 625-633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In addition, cytoplasmic N termini have been shown to be important regulators of function in channels after they have been assembled (42Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar, 43Zagotta W.N. Hoshi T. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 568-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). Interestingly, proteins closely related to hENaC, the degenerins of C. elegans, also appear to be inhibited by overexpression of their cytoplasmic N termini. 2M. Driscoll, personal communication. Thus, the functional effect of the γ N terminus may reflect a general property of this family of ion channels. To determine if the truncated γ subunits affected hENaC assembly, we examined the amount of α subunit protein in oocytes co-expressing mutant γ subunits. Like other types of cells, Xenopusoocytes possess a quality control mechanism to degrade misfolded or improperly assembled proteins. Co-expression of truncated γ subunits caused a dramatic reduction in the amount of α, suggesting that a reduction in the number of functional channel proteins was the underlying mechanism of inhibition. This result was consistent with a model in which the truncated γ subunits interact with α early in subunit biogenesis, forming unstable complexes of mutant and wild-type protein that are degraded by the cell.

https://openalex.org/W2008096080,"PTPH1 is a human protein-tyrosine phosphatase with homology to the band 4.1 superfamily of cytoskeletal-associated proteins. PTPH1 was found to associate with 14-3-3ॆ using a yeast two-hybrid screen, and its interaction could be reconstituted in vitro using recombinant proteins. Examination of the interaction between 14-3-3ॆ and various deletion mutants of PTPH1 by two-hybrid tests suggested that the integrity of the PTP is important for this binding. Although both PTPH1 and Raf-1 form complexes with 14-3-3ॆ, they appear to do so independently. Binding of 14-3-3ॆ to PTPH1in vitro was abolished by pretreating PTPH1 with potato acid phosphatase and was greatly enhanced by pretreating with Cdc25C-associated protein kinase. Thus the association between PTPH1 and 14-3-3ॆ is phosphorylation-dependent. Two novel motifs RSLS359VE and RVDS853EP in PTPH1 were identified as major 14-3-3ॆ-binding sites, both of which are distinct from the consensus binding motif RSXSXP recently found in Raf-1. Mutation of Ser359 and Ser853 to alanine significantly reduced the association between 14-3-3ॆ and PTPH1. Furthermore, association of PTPH1 and 14-3-3ॆ was detected in several cell lines and was regulated in response to extracellular signals. These results raise the possibility that 14-3-3ॆ may function as an adaptor molecule in the regulation of PTPH1 and may provide a link between serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways.

In these enzymes, the band 4.1 domain and PTP domain are separated by a central segment that contains one to five (PTPH1 has one) PDZ domains (also known as DHR or GLGF domains) (13Kennedy M.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are involved in regulating protein-protein interactions, as illustrated in the interactions of postsynaptic density protein PSD-95 with neuronal type nitric-oxide synthase N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptors, and Shaker-type potassium channels (14Gomperts S.N.

Band 4.1 homology domains themselves are also responsible for targeting cytoskeletal-associated proteins to cytoskeleton-membrane interfaces (4Arpin M. Algrain M. Louvard D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the N-terminal segment of PTPH1 can regulate its enzymatic function (17Zhang S.-H. Eckberg W.R. Yang Q. Samatar A.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20067-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Tryptic removal of the N-terminal segment of PTPH1 activates the enzyme up to 10-fold. The observation of this intramolecular regulation of PTPH1 activity, and the possibility that the regulation of PTPH1 in vivo may be achieved by interaction with multiple proteins through the various binding domains discussed above, stimulated our interest in searching for proteins that interact with PTPH1. As described in the following study, 14-3-3ॆ was identified as a PTPH1 interacting protein. 14-3-3s are a family of highly conserved acidic proteins, with molecular masses around 30 kDa, that are involved in cell cycle control, transformation, mitogenic signaling pathways (18Morrison D.

Furthermore, crystallographic studies indicate that each monomer in a 14-3-3 dimer contains a large groove that can dock another molecule (24Liu D. Bienkowska J. Petosa C. Collier R.J. Fu H.

Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Our initial approach involved a yeast two-hybrid screening strategy. Using full-length PTPH1 as a bait, we have isolated 14-3-3ॆ protein from a HeLa cell cDNA library. Stable complexes between PTPH1 and 14-3-3ॆ were reconstituted in insect Sf9 cells. We have demonstrated that PTPH1 binds 14-3-3ॆ in vitro in a serine phosphorylation-dependent manner. Two motifs in PTPH1 were shown to be involved in 14-3-3ॆ binding, one of them is phosphorylated in vitro by C-TAK1 (cdc25C-associated protein kinase). Furthermore, we have shown that PTPH1 and 14-3-3 associate in vivo in several human cell lines and the complex may be regulated in response to extracellular signals. These results raise the possibility that 14-3-3ॆ may function as an adaptor molecule in the regulation of PTPH1 and may provide a link between serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways. Full-length and truncated PTPH1 cDNAs were fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain in vector pGBT8 to produce baits for yeast two-hybrid screens (see Fig.1). All constructs were generated by convenient restriction enzyme sites or a polymerase chain reaction. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Muta-Gene kit (Bio-Rad) and confirmed by double strand DNA sequencing. A HeLa cell two-hybrid cDNA library (fused to the GAL4 activation domain) in vector pGADGH and yeast hostSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c were kindly provided by G. Hannon (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory). Other plasmids used in control experiments were generous gifts of our colleagues at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory: pGBT8-TCPTP (Y.-F. Hu), pGBT8-lamin (J. Stolarov), and pGADGH-Ste4 (H. Tu). Yeast two-hybrid screening techniques and medium compositions were as described byCLONTECH. Initially, HF7c yeast cells were cotransformed with the full-length PTPH1 construct and the HeLa cDNA library. Interaction between PTPH1 and proteins encoded by the cDNA library will reconstitute the GAL4 activator and activateHIS3 and LacZ reporter genes. HIS3confers upon yeast the ability to grow on histidine-free medium, whereas LacZ produces ॆ-galactosidase that can be detected colorimetrically by filter assays. 3-Aminotriazole was included at 10 mm in all selection media to suppress leaky growth fromHIS3. Mouse anti-PTPH1 serum, pAbZ5, and monoclonal antibody, mAbZ2, were generated using purified full-length PTPH1 from Sf9 cells as an antigen (17Zhang S.-H. Eckberg W.R. Yang Q. Samatar A.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20067-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against 14-3-3ॆ (SC#628) and Raf-1 (SC#227) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal antibody against Raf-1 (R19120) was purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and secondary antibodies or protein A that were coupled to horseradish peroxidase used in all immunoblot analyses were purchased from Amersham Corp. and used as described previously (17Zhang S.-H.

Human 293, A431, HaCaT, and Saos-2 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 107 fetal bovine serum. Transfection of 293 cells with Raf-1 (kindly provided by L. Van Aelst) and PTPH1 in vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was performed with a standard calcium phosphate method.32P labeling of 293 and A431 cells was performed with 0.5 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) for 9 h in phosphate-free DMEM with 57 fetal bovine serum. In metabolic labeling experiments, 40 h after transfection, cells were labeled for 4 h with 0.1 mCi/ml l-[35S]methionine (DuPont NEN) in methionine-free DMEM supplemented with 57 fetal bovine serum. Sf9 cells were labeled the same way in Grace's medium. Cell lysates were prepared in Nonidet P-40 buffer and clarified as described previously (39Zhang S.-H. Broome M.A. Lawton M.A. Hunter T. Lamb C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17593-17599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation was conducted by incubating cell lysates with antibodies prebound to protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were washed four times with Nonidet P-40 buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE (97 gels have been used throughout this study), blotted onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore), and analyzed by autoradiography and/or immunoblotting. Phosphoamino acid analysis of 32P-labeled PTPH1 was performed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography as described elsewhere (40van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Hardie D.G. Protein Phosphorylation, a Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 31-59Google Scholar). PTPH1 was expressed in Sf9 cells and purified by fast protein liquid chromatography as described previously (17Zhang S.-H. Eckberg W.R. Yang Q. Samatar A.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20067-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The 14-3-3ॆ open reading frame was fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) in vector pMAL-c2, the fusion proteins (MBP14-3-3ॆ and MBP) were expressed inEscherichia coli and purified by binding to amylose resin and eluting with maltose according to the procedure described by the manufacture (New England Biolabs). 14-3-3ॆ was also expressed in untagged form in Sf9 cells using a recombinant baculovirus (kindly provided by D. Conklin). Purified PTPH1 was incubated with MBP or MBP14-3-3ॆ bound on amylose beads in PBST (phosphate-buffered saline with 0.57 Triton X-100) containing 17 bovine serum albumin. After 1 h of incubation at 4 °C, the beads were washed four times with PBST. Bound material was then analyzed by anti-PTPH1 immunoblotting. For PTP assays, the binding was performed in PTP buffer (25 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) with the addition of 150 mm NaCl. After washing three times in PTP buffer to remove the NaCl, the bound 14-3-3ॆ·PTPH1 complexes were eluted with 20 mm maltose in PTP buffer. The amount of PTPH1 in these complexes was determined by comparing 14-3-3ॆ-bound PTPH1 with serial dilutions of known amounts of PTPH1 on an immunoblot. Tyrosine phosphatase activity of PTPH1, either complexed with 14-3-3ॆ or uncomplexed, was measured with phosphotyrosyl RCML (reduced, carboxamidomethylated, and maleylated lysozyme), myelin basic protein, and polyGlu:Tyr (4:1) (pGluTyr) as described previously (17Zhang S.-H.

Purified PTPH1 was incubated at 30 °C with potato acid phosphatase type VII (PAP, Sigma), at a ratio of 1 ॖg of PTPH1/0.1 unit of PAP, in PAP buffer (20 mmMES-OH, pH 5.5, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 10 ॖg/ml aprotinin, 10 ॖg/ml lima bean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mm benzamidine). At various time points, an aliquot (1 ॖg of PTPH1) was taken and processed as described for in vitro binding assays, after addition of 20 mm ॆ-glycerol phosphate to inhibit the remaining PAP activity. Purified PTPH1 was phosphorylated for 30 min at 30 °C by recombinant C-TAK1 (42Ogg S. Gabrielli B. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30461-30469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in the following reaction buffer: 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ॖm γ-[32P]ATP (8000 cpm/pmol). For phosphopeptide analysis, 10 ॖg of phosphorylated PTPH1 were purified by SDS-PAGE. The gel slice containing the PTPH1 was then digested overnight in 30 mm NH4HCO3containing 1 ॖg of sequencing grade trypsin (Boehringer Mannheim). The supernatants containing tryptic peptides were separated on HPLC. The fractions containing the highest radioactive material were processed to determine both amino acid sequence and identity of the phosphorylated residue as described previously (43Russo G.L. Vandenberg M.T. Yu I.J. Bae Y.-S. Franza Jr., B.R. Marshak D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20317-20325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two hundred positives were isolated from an initial screening of 1 million HeLa cell cDNA clones using full-length PTPH1 as a probe. After subsequent purification and curing processes, plasmids of 30 strong interacting clones were isolated for sequence analysis. Ten of these clones encode 14-3-3ॆ fused in-frame with the GAL4 DNA binding domain. As controls under the same conditions, 14-3-3ॆ did not interact with another protein-tyrosine phosphatase, TCPTP, or nuclear lamin C (Fig.1 B). A series of PTPH1 constructs and the 14-3-3ॆ clone were cotransformed into yeast to test the specificity of the interaction. Immunoblot analyses of the cotransformed yeast with an anti-GAL4 antibody indicate that each of the PTPH1 constructs was expressed to a similar level (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1 B, PTPH1 interacts specifically with 14-3-3ॆ, but not with the protein of an unrelated yeast gene Ste4 fused to the activation domain, as indicated by the growth on selection medium without histidine. Furthermore, 14-3-3ॆ interacted strongly only with full-length PTPH1 (PTPH1-F) and less strongly with the N-terminal two-thirds of PTPH1 (PTPH1-N). PTPH1-F expressors grew on histidine-free medium containing 30 mm 3-aminotriazole, whereas PTPH1-N expressors grew only on medium containing less than 10 mm 3-aminotriazole. However, 14-3-3ॆ did not interact with the A or C domain alone (PTPH1-A andPTPH1-C), nor with full-length PTPH1 containing an internal deletion that removes half of the B domain and half of the C domain (PTPH1-NC, Fig. 1 B). We attempted to determine whether the B domain alone interacts with 14-3-3, however, the B domain construct (PTPH1-B) supported growth on histidine-free medium by itself (data not shown). Furthermore, the isolated PDZ motif (PTPH1-PDZ) contained in the B domain did not interact with 14-3-3ॆ (data not shown). These results indicate that PTPH1 interacts with 14-3-3ॆ specifically in the yeast two-hybrid system and that the integrity of PTPH1 is important for optimal interaction. To test whether 14-3-3ॆ can bind to PTPH1 in vitro, purified PTPH1 from Sf9 cells was incubated with MBP or MBP14-3-3ॆ that was prebound to amylose beads. As shown in Fig.2 A, PTPH1 bound specifically to 14-3-3ॆ, but not the MBP moiety, in a concentration-dependent manner. However, binding of 14-3-3ॆ did not result in a significant change in the enzymatic activity of PTPH1, as measured with three different tyrosyl-phosphorylated substrates (RCML, myelin basic protein, and pGluTyr) (Fig. 2 B). To reconstitute the interaction between 14-3-3ॆ and PTPH1 in a cellular context, Sf9 cells were coinfected with baculoviruses expressing PTPH1 and 14-3-3ॆ, and the complexes formed between the two proteins were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig.3 A, 14-3-3ॆ was present in the anti-PTPH1 immune complexes from [35S]methionine-labeled Sf9 cells that were coinfected with PTPH1 and 14-3-3ॆ baculoviruses. Similarly, PTPH1 was detected in the anti-14-3-3ॆ complexes from the coinfected Sf9 cells. The stoichiometry of the association was estimated to be ∼2 mol of 14-3-3ॆ per mol of PTPH1 by densitometric analysis of Fig.3 A. To confirm that 14-3-3ॆ and PTPH1 associate at physiological levels of expression, anti-14-3-3ॆ immune complexes from untransfected human 293, A431, HaCaT, and Saos-2 cells were analyzed. As shown in Fig.3 B, PTPH1 was found in anti-14-3-3ॆ immune complexes from each cell line tested. Interestingly, HaCaT cells have more PTPH1 than 293 cells, but less PTPH1 was found in complexes with 14-3-3ॆ, even though both cell lines have similar amounts of 14-3-3ॆ protein. This suggests that the extent of association may be regulated by factors, such as differential phosphorylation or subcellular localization of either protein, in addition to the abundance of the two proteins. Furthermore, treatment of quiescent 293 cells with EGF resulted in a 507 reduction in the association between PTPH1 and 14-3-3ॆ (Fig.3 C). Since both PTPH1 and Raf bind to 14-3-3ॆ, they both may be recruited into the same multiprotein complexes and function in the same signaling cascades. To address this, immune complexes were analyzed from [35S]methionine-labeled 293 cells that were cotransfected with PTPH1 and Raf-1. As shown in Fig. 4,35S-labeled endogenous 14-3-3 proteins were found in both anti-PTPH1 and anti-Raf immune complexes. The significance of the slightly different spectra of 14-3-3 proteins detected in the two immune complexes is currently unknown. Conversely, both PTPH1 and Raf were also detected in anti-14-3-3ॆ immune complexes. However, under conditions in which both PTPH1 and Raf were quantitatively immunodepleted from cell lysates by their respective antibodies, PTPH1 was not detected in anti-Raf immune complexes and Raf was not observed in anti-PTPH1 immune complexes. Trace amounts of PTPH1 were detected in Raf immune complexes only from 293 cells in which PTPH1 was grossly overexpressed from a stronger promoter (data not shown). This situation is distinct from the association of Bcr and Raf, in which 14-3-3ॆ serves as a molecular bridge to direct the interaction (33Braselmann S. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4839-4848Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This suggests that PTPH1 and Raf do not function simultaneously in the same 14-3-3ॆ complexes or signaling cascades. In the initial binding assays, we were unable to detect binding between 14-3-3ॆ and PTPH1 expressed inE. coli (data not shown). However, using PTPH1 expressed in Sf9 cells the association with 14-3-3ॆ was successfully demonstratedin vitro (Fig. 2 A). PTPH1 from A431, 293, and Sf9 cells was phosphorylated on seryl residues (Fig.5 A), and PTPH1 from Sf9 cells contained at least four major phosphorylation sites (data not shown). These findings suggest that eukaryotic modifications such as phosphorylation may play a role in regulating the binding interaction. As indicated in Fig. 5 B, the specific interaction of PTPH1 and 14-3-3ॆ was totally abolished by the pretreatment of PTPH1 with PAP. The disruption of the association was not due to proteolytic degradation of PTPH1, since the overall level and integrity of the protein remained constant through the PAP treatment (Fig.5 B). These results demonstrated that phosphorylation of PTPH1 is a prerequisite for the association between PTPH1 and 14-3-3ॆ. To identify specific 14-3-3 binding sites regulated by protein phosphorylation, protein serine/threonine kinases were tested for their ability to phosphorylate PTPH1. C-TAK1 was originally purified as a Cdc25C-associated protein kinase (42Ogg S. Gabrielli B. Piwnica-Worms H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30461-30469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It binds to Cdc25C and phosphorylates serine 216, which represents a perfect 14-3-3 binding motif. 2H. Piwnica-Worms, unpublished data. As shown in Fig.6, C-TAK1 phosphorylated PTPH1 on a single site and enhanced 14-3-3ॆ binding by >5-fold. When C-TAK1-phosphorylated PTPH1 was trypsinized, only two tryptic peptides (p27 and p28) contained significant32P radioactivity. Sequencing of these two peptides indicated that p27 and p28 differ by a single arginine at the N terminus. This is due to the trypsin cleavage at alternative arginines in the amino acid sequence of RRSLS359VEH in PTPH1. To identify which serine was phosphorylated by C-TAK1, we subjected p28 to Edman degradation and determined at which cycle a burst of [32P]phosphate was recovered. As shown in Fig.6 C, the third sequencing cycle is the radioactive peak, indicating that Ser359 is the phosphorylated amino acid. Although PTPH1 does not contain an exact copy of the 14-3-3 binding motif corresponding to that found in Raf (RSXSXP) (48Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), it does have two potential 14-3-3-binding sites (RSLS359VEH and RVDS853EP) that display some features of the motif. To test whether both RSLS359VEH and RVDS853EP are involved in binding to 14-3-3ॆ, serine resides 359 and 853 of PTPH1 were changed to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig.7 A). To confirm that 14-3-3ॆ binds to Ser359, the major site of phosphorylation by C-TAK1, purified Ser359 to alanine mutant (SA1) was phosphorylated by C-TAK1 and used in binding assays. As demonstrated in Fig. 7 B, this mutation diminished the phosphorylation by C-TAK1 by 907 and abolished the enhanced binding to 14-3-3ॆ. When lysates from Sf9 cells expressing the two single serine to alanine mutants SA1 and SA2 were incubated with 14-3-3ॆ beads, the binding of both mutants to 14-3-3ॆ was significantly reduced compared with wild-type PTPH1. The double serine to alanine mutation, SA3, reduced the binding by ∼807 (Fig. 7 C). Thus in a cellular context phosphorylation of PTPH1 on at least two sites regulates its association with 14-3-3ॆ. PTPs have the potential to exert a considerable influence on tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent signaling pathways, both augmenting and antagonizing the function of protein tyrosine kinases. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanism of regulation of PTP function. Both protein kinases and phosphatases have been shown to be regulated by association with anchor and scaffold proteins (44Faux M.C. Scott J.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 9-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time an association between PTPH1 and 14-3-3ॆ both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, both 14-3-3s (20Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) and PTPH1 are abundantly expressed in brain, 3S.-H. Zhang and N. K. Tonks, unpublished data. and in the rat, PTPH1 is concentrated particularly in thalamus (45Sahin M. Slaugenhaupt S.A. Gusella J.F. Hockfield S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7859-7863Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Since none of the individual domains of PTPH1 alone interacted with 14-3-3ॆ in yeast two-hybrid tests, the higher order structure of PTPH1 appears very important for the optimal interaction. We demonstrated further that serine phosphorylation of PTPH1 is a prerequisite for this binding. Binding of 14-3-3ॆ to PTPH1 in vitro was abolished by pretreating PTPH1 with PAP and was greatly enhanced by pretreating with C-TAK1. This is in agreement with previous findings of a requirement for phosphorylation in other proteins that interact with 14-3-3 (21Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 37Ichimura T. Uchiyama J. Kunihiro O. Ito M. Horigome T. Omata S. Shinkai F. Kaji H. Isobe T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Using in vitrobinding assays, we have identified two major 14-3-3ॆ-binding sites in PTPH1. Of six potential serine phosphorylation sites in PTPH1 with some features of the 14-3-3 consensus recognition site identified in Raf (48Muslin A.J. Tanner J.W. Allen P.M. Shaw A.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 889-897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar), RSLS359VEH at the junction of the band 4.1 domain and middle segment and RVDS853EP in the catalytic domain display the greatest similarity to the RSX S XP (underline indicates phosphoserine) motif. Mutation of Ser359 and Ser853 to alanine reduced the association of phosphatase with 14-3-3ॆ in vitro by 807, indicating that Ser359 and Ser853 are the major 14-3-3ॆ-binding sites. These results indicate that the consensus motif RSX S XP found in Raf is not strictly required for interactions with 14-3-3. Platelet glycoprotein Ibα (38Du X. Fox J.E. Pei S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7362-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), Bcr (32Reuther G.W. Cripe L.D. Collier R.J. Pendergast A.-M. Science. 1994; 266: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), and tryptophan hydroxylase (37Ichimura T. Uchiyama J. Kunihiro O. Ito M. Horigome T. Omata S. Shinkai F. Kaji H. Isobe T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28515-28518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) are known binding proteins of 14-3-3; however, inspection of their sequences also revealed no motif identical to the consensus RSX S XP. Recently, new 14-3-3 binding sequences were found in protooncogene Cbl as RHSLPFS and RLGSTFS (49Liu Y.-C. Liu Y. Elly C. Yoshida H. Lipkowitz S. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9979-9985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), which do not fit exactly with the consensus RSX S XP. Taken together, it would appear that the recognition of 14-3-3 can be achieved by multiple proteins containing phosphoserine in motifs that diverge significantly from the one found in Raf. 14-3-3 proteins are a family of at least seven members that display distinct expression patterns in different cells or tissues (20Aitken A. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 341-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Similar to the way SH2 domains bind to phosphotyrosyl residues, different isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins may bind specifically to phosphoseryl residues contained in different recognition motifs. The different recognition motifs may be phosphorylated in response to distinct signals, creating an additional level of complexity and specificity in the role of 14-3-3 proteins. There are multiple sites of serine phosphorylation in PTPH1 in vivo (data not shown), including the two sites identified here, raising the possibility that PTPH1 may associate with different spectra of 14-3-3 proteins in response to various signals. Preliminary data suggest that 207 of PTPH1 is associated with 14-3-3ॆ protein in quiescent 293 cells (data not shown), whereas this association drops by 507 upon EGF stimulation (Fig. 3 C). The differential association of PTPH1 and 14-3-3 in different cell lines may reflect a difference in phosphorylation status or subcellular localization of PTPH1. Through the action of 14-3-3, PTPH1 may function in cross-talk between protein serine and tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent steps in signal transduction pathways. We are currently trying to identify proteins that become linked to PTPH1 through binding of 14-3-3. We have shown previously that the sequences flanking the catalytic domain of PTPH1 have an inhibitory effect on activity (17Zhang S.-H. Eckberg W.R. Yang Q. Samatar A.A. Tonks N.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20067-20072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, using artificial substrates we have not been able to detect a significant effect of 14-3-3ॆ binding on the phosphatase activity of PTPH1. It is possible that significant effects may be demonstrated with the yet to be identified physiological substrate(s) of PTPH1 instead of the artificial substrates used in the PTP assays to date. Indeed, the direct effects of 14-3-3 binding on the enzymatic properties of associated proteins such as Raf and protein kinase C (20Aitken A.

Biol. 1995; 15: 3390-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) remain controversial and unclear. It is also possible that significant effects on the PTP activity of PTPH1 may require a combined action of several regulators, such as proteins interacting with the band 4.1 and/or PDZ domain of PTPH1, possibly with 14-3-3ॆ being a cofactor. PTPH1 was phosphorylated exclusively on serine in either insect Sf9 or human 293 and A431 cells. C-TAK1 phosphorylates Ser359 on PTPH1, one of the two major 14-3-3ॆ binding sites, almost exclusivelyin vitro. Mutation of Ser359 to alanine reduced by 907 the C-TAK1-mediated phosphorylation of PTPH1 and completely abolished the C-TAK1-mediated enhancement of binding to 14-3-3ॆin vitro. Protein kinase C also phosphorylated PTPH1 and enhanced its binding to 14-3-3ॆ, but the phosphorylation is complex, involving multiple sites (data not shown). Apart from C-TAK1 and protein kinase C, we have failed to detect significant phosphorylation of PTPH1 and enhancement of 14-3-3ॆ binding by protein kinase A and casein kinase II. It is currently unclear which protein kinase phosphorylates PTPH1 in vivo; however, C-TAK1 and members of the protein kinase C family certainly cannot be ruled out. In conclusion, we have identified 14-3-3ॆ as a PTPH1-associated protein. Our findings of 14-3-3ॆ binding to novel phosphoserine motifs in PTPH1 further support the notion that protein-protein interaction may play a significant role in the regulation and function of PTPH1, as well as other PTPs, in cross-talk mediated by protein serine and tyrosine phosphorylation cascades.

https://openalex.org/W2085119174,"Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase is a lysosomal hydrolase that removes long chain fatty acyl groups from modified cysteine residues in proteins. Mutations in this enzyme were recently shown to underlie the hereditary neurodegenerative disorder, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and lipid thioesters derived from acylated proteins were found to accumulate in lymphoblasts from individuals with the disorder. In the current study, we describe the cloning and expression of a second lysosomal thioesterase, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase 2 (PPT2), that shares an 187 identity with palmitoyl-protein thioesterase. Transient expression of a PPT2 cDNA led to the production of a glycosylated lysosomal protein with palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity comparable with palmitoyl-protein thioesterase. However, PPT2 did not remove palmitate groups from palmitoylated proteins that are substrates for palmitoyl-protein thioesterase. In cross-correction experiments, PPT2 did not abolish the accumulation of protein-derived lipid thioesters in palmitoyl-protein thioesterase-deficient cell lines. These results indicate that PPT2 is a lysosomal thioesterase that possesses a substrate specificity that is distinct from that of palmitoyl-protein thioesterase.

A growing number of proteins have been shown to undergo post-translational modification by fatty acids that are covalently linked to cysteine residues through a thioester bond (reviewed in Ref.1Schlesinger M.J. Veit M. Schmidt M.F.G. Schlesinger M.J. Lipid Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-19Google Scholar). Usually, the modified cysteine residue is located in close proximity to the inner surface of the plasma membrane, and palmitate is the most commonly occurring fatty acid, although stearate, oleate, arachidonate, and small amounts of other fatty acids have also been described. Fatty acid modifications may contribute to intracellular protein localization by facilitating membrane binding and also by strengthening protein-protein interactions (reviewed in Ref. 2Casey P.J. Science. 1995; 268: 221-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the palmitate plays a structural role that is unique to each modified protein. Cycles of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation have been described for a number of intracellular proteins (3Milligan G. Parenti M. Magee A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), but the relevant enzyme(s) that catalyze these processes have not been isolated or fully characterized, and the full significance of these cycles remains to be elucidated. In an initial attempt to study the mechanism of depalmitoylation of Ha-Ras, we purified and cloned a thioesterase (palmitoyl-protein thioesterase, which will be referred to as PPT1) 1The abbreviations used are: PPT, palmitoyl-protein thioesterase; INCL, infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; Endo H, endoglycosidase H; PNGase F, peptide-N-(N-acetyl-ॆ-d-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase; kb, kilobase pair; LTBP, latent transforming growth factor-ॆ-binding protein. that preferentially removes fatty acyl chains of 14–18 carbons (i.e. myristate, palmitate, stearate, and oleate) from proteins in vitro (4Camp L.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23212-23219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although PPT1 was originally purified from the soluble fraction of bovine brain, it was later found to be targeted to lysosomes (6Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol.

Mutations in PPT1 were recently found to cause the infantile form of neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) (9Vesa J. Hellsten E. Verkruyse L.A. Camp L.A. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Hofmann S.L. Peltonen L. Nature. 1995; 376: 584-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar), a neurovisceral storage disorder. This disease is characterized by the accumulation of amorphous granular deposits in cortical neurons leading to early visual loss and progressive mental deterioration by age 3, with death by 8–14 years of age (10Haltia M. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Acta Neuropathol. 1973; 26: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 11Haltia M. Rapola J. Santavuori P. Keranen A. J. Neurol. Sci. 1973; 18: 269-285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In vitro, small lipid thioesters that are substrates for PPT1 were found to accumulate in lymphoblasts from these patients (12Lu J.-Y. Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10046-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The lipid thioesters were labeled with [35S]cysteine and their accumulation was blocked by cycloheximide, indicating that they are derived from acylated proteins. The accumulation of these compounds could also be prevented by the addition of recombinant PPT1 to the culture medium, via uptake of PPT1 into lysosomes through the mannose 6-phosphate receptor pathway. In this report, we present the cloning and expression of human recombinant PPT2, a homolog of PPT1 that shares an 187 identity at the amino acid level. We find that PPT1 and PPT2 have comparable palmitoyl-CoA thioesterase activities and neutral pH optima and that PPT2 (like PPT1) is a lysosomal enzyme. In contrast, PPT2 does not remove palmitate from palmitoylated protein substrates routinely used as substrates for PPT1. This result suggests that PPT2 has a distinct substrate specificity and may play a unique role in the hydrolysis of lipid thioesters in lysosomes.

The filters were washed twice for 15 min in 2 × SSC containing 17 SDS (w/v) at ambient temperature, and once in 0.1 × SSC containing 17 SDS at 60 °C for 1 h. A 0.9-kbSmaI/PstI fragment of PPT2 (clone C, Fig. 1), corresponding to the coding region exclusive of the amino-terminal 64 residues, was excised from pCMV-SPORT and subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector, pQE32. The recombinant protein was produced in E. coli strain M15 (pREP4) and purified under denaturing conditions on a nickel-nitrolotriacetic acid resin according to the manufacturer's instructions. Expression of this construct yielded a fusion protein with a His6 affinity tag at the amino terminus of the protein. The E. coli-produced recombinant protein was separated by preparative SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroeluted from the gel (15Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 61-70Google Scholar). Polyclonal antiserum raised against purified recombinant human PPT2 was produced by Pocono Rabbit Farm (Canadensis, PA) using their standard fusion protein protocol. Antiserum to human PPT2 was diluted 1:1 with 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and loaded onto a protein A-Sepharose column. After washing with the same buffer, bound IgG was eluted from the column with 0.2 m glycine, pH 2.2. Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected into tubes containing 0.1 ml of 1 m K2HPO4. The purified IgG was dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C and loaded onto a PPT2 affinity column. The PPT2 affinity column was prepared by coupling 1.4 mg of E. coli-produced protein to 200 mg of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions, except that 0.57 Triton X-100 was included in the coupling buffer. The column was washed with buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA, eluted with glycine buffer to recover the affinity-purified antibody as described above. To amplify the entire coding region of human PPT2, oligonucleotide primers corresponding to nucleotides −17 to +3 and +935 to +954 relative to the translation start site of the PPT2 clone A (Fig. 1) (5′-ATCGGATCCCTTTCTCAGGCGGGAGCATG-3′ and 5′-TAAGGATCCTTGGTCTCTGGACCGAGGAG-3′) were employed in a polymerase chain reaction using clone A as the template in the presence ofPfu DNA polymerase (2.5 units/reaction). The 970-base pair amplified product was subcloned into the BamHI site of the expression vector, pCMV5, to yield pCMV5-hPPT2. Insert orientation and polymerase fidelity was verified by restriction mapping and dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The human PPT1 expression plasmid, pCMV5-hPPT, has been previously described (12Lu J.-Y. Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Simian COS-1 cells were maintained in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) with 107 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 ॖg/ml amphotericin at 37 °C in a humidified 57 CO2 atmosphere. Cells growing in 60-mm plates were transiently transfected with 5 ॖg of DNA and 10 ॖl of Lipofectin reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested at 60–72 h post-transfection into sonication buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 2 mm EGTA and homogenized by brief sonication for use in enzyme assays. Alternatively, cells were harvested directly for Percoll density gradient fractionation. Conditioned medium from transfected cells was pooled and centrifuged at 220 × g for 5 min in a Beckman GS6R benchtop centrifuge, frozen under liquid nitrogen, and stored at −85 °C. Three 60-mm dishes of COS-1 cells transiently transfected with either pCMV5 or pCMV5-hPPT2 were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into homogenization buffer containing 0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mm EDTA. Cells were gently lysed by 20 passages through a ball bearing homogenizer (H and Y Enterprises, Redwood city, CA) with a clearance of 51 ॖm. Nuclei and unbroken cells were removed by centrifugation at 400 ×g for 10 min, and 0.8 ml of the resulting supernatant was layered over a discontinuous gradient consisting of a 1.2-ml cushion of 2.5 m sucrose and 8.5 ml of an 187 Percoll solution in homogenization buffer. The gradient was centrifuged for 60 min at 27,000 rpm (67,000 × g max) in a Sorvall T1270 rotor. The cushion and nine 1.0-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. Percoll was removed from the samples by centrifugation for 40 min at 70,000 rpm in a Beckman TL 100.3 rotor, and the resulting supernatants were homogenized by sonication. ॆ-Hexosaminidase activity (lysosomal marker) was determined as described (16Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Assays for other organellar marker enzymes (NADPH-cytochrome c reductase, alkaline phosphodiesterase-1, and α-mannosidase II for endoplasmic reticulum, plasma, and Golgi membranes, respectively) were performed as described previously (17Storrie B. Madden E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 203-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Serum-free conditioned medium containing recombinant human PPT was produced from plates of transfected COS-1 cells as follows. On day 0, five 60-mm dishes of COS-1 cells were transfected with pCMV5-PPT2 or control plasmid using Lipofectin reagent in the presence of serum-free medium according to the directions supplied by the manufacturer. On day 1, cells were fed with serum-containing medium, and on day 2, cells were changed to serum-free medium. The medium was harvested on day 3, concentrated 15-fold using a Centricon device, and diluted 1:3 (v/v) with fresh medium just prior to use. For PPT2 uptake experiments, untransfected COS-1 cells were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells/60-mm dish on day 0, and on day 1, PPT2-containing conditioned medium was added. Incubations were carried out at 37 °C for 20 h in the presence or absence of 5 mm mannose 6-phosphate or 5 mm mannose. Cells were washed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into sonication buffer. Cell extracts were homogenized by sonication and either assayed for palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity or analyzed by immunoblotting as described below. Crude transfected COS-1 cell homogenates were digested with PNGase F or Endo H according to directions supplied by the manufacturer, electrophoresed in 127 SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels under reducing conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters as described previously (6Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15831-15836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Filters were incubated for 1 h in PBS-T (0.17 Tween-20 in phosphate-buffered saline) containing 57 (w/v) nonfat dry milk, washed in PBS-T, and incubated for 1 h with affinity-purified antibody (0.5 ॖg/ml) in PBS-T. The filters were washed and incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (1:2000 in PBS-T) and developed using ECL reagents. The palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity of transfected COS cells was determined by measuring the release of [3H]palmitic acid from [3H]palmitoyl-CoA, which was monitored by liquid scintillation after extraction with Dole's reagent (18Dole V.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1956; 35: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (1598) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture contained 100 ॖm palmitoyl-CoA (5,000–6,000 cpm/nmol), 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, and enzyme in a final volume of 100 ॖl. In some experiments, as indicated in the figure legends, the COS cell lysates were pretreated with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide for 30 min at 37 °C to reduce an endogenous palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity with significant interfering activity above pH 6.0. [3H]Palmitoyl-CoA was synthesized from [3H]palmitic acid as described previously (19Duncan J.A. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23594-23600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Palmitoyl-protein thioesterase activity was determined using [3H]palmitate-labeled Ha-Ras and [3H]palmitate-labeled pentamannosylphosphate-modified human albumin as substrates. Palmitoyl-Ras thioesterase assays were performed by monitoring the release of radioactivity from recombinant [3H]palmitate-labeled Ha-Ras produced in the insect cell-baculovirus system as described previously (4Camp L.A. Hofmann S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22566-22574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). [3H]Palmitate-labeled human albumin was a gift of Dr. Jui-Yun Lu (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) and was synthesized by autoacylation of pentamannosylphosphate-modified human albumin (20Duncan J.R. Welch M.J. J. Nuclear Med. 1993; 34: 1728-1738PubMed Google Scholar) by [3H]palmitoyl-CoA in the presence of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. Conditioned medium containing human recombinant PPT1 or PPT2 was prepared by transient transfection of COS-1 cells with pCMV5-hPPT1 or pCMV5-hPPT2 (or pCMV5, which served as a control). Medium was harvested at 72 h after transfection, concentrated approximately 10-fold using a Centricon concentrator, and mixed with 3 volumes of fresh medium just prior to use. The final concentrations of PPT1 and PPT2 (based on palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity) were 3.5 units/ml (1 unit = 1 nmol of palmitate released/min) and 4.2 units/ml, respectively. (pCMV5-transfected COS-1 cell medium contained <0.1 unit/ml of palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity). Control and INCL human skin fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) with 207 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 ॖg/ml amphotericin at 37 °C in a humidified 57 CO2 atmosphere. Cells were plated at a density of 0.3 × 105 cells/100 mm on day 0. On day 2, conditioned medium (10 ml) containing PPT1 or PPT2 was added. On day 4, the cells were washed twice with prewarmed cysteine and serum-free medium, resuspended in 5 ml of the same medium, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Fresh medium (5 ml) containing [35S]cysteine (20 ॖCi/ml) was added, and the incubation was continued for 15 h. Labeled cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and extracted into 6 volumes of chloroform/methanol (1:1, v/v), and the organic phase was analyzed by thin layer chromatography as described previously (12Lu J.-Y. Verkruyse L.A. Hofmann S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10046-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To demonstrate uptake of recombinant PPT1 and PPT2 into fibroblasts, plates were set up in parallel, and cell lysates were analyzed for total cellular palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase activity and subjected to immunoblotting using anti-PPT1 or anti-PPT2 antibodies as described above. A BLAST search of the Genome Database was used to identify a set of overlapping expressed sequence-tagged clones with homology to palmitoyl-protein thioesterase. Fig. 1 shows three independent PPT2 cDNA clones that were fully characterized. Clones A and B (Fig. 1) were obtained from human melanocyte and human retinal libraries, respectively (through the I.M.A.G.E. Consortium). Clone C was obtained by screening a human lung cDNA library using the GenetrapperTM cDNA positive selection system, which utilizes oligonucleotide hybridization and magnetic bead separation to isolate specific cDNA-bearing plasmids. A second human lung PPT2 cDNA, identical to clone C but starting at nucleotide −9 relative to the initiation codon, was also fully characterized (data not shown). Clones A and B (Fig. 1) each contained the entire coding region and 3′-untranslated region of human PPT2. Clones A and B were identical from nucleotide −9 to 1634 (with A of the initiator methionine as +1). Clone A contained 113 nucleotides of genomic (intron) sequences at the 5′-end, as indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 1. This presumably arose by reverse transcription of an mRNA containing an unprocessed intron, since these sequences are also present in a genomic clone containing the PPT2 gene (see below) and contain sequences consistent with splice donor and acceptor sites. Clone C contained an additional 209 nucleotides of 5′-untranslated sequence as compared with clone B. In addition, the sequence of clone C diverged within the coding region starting at nucleotide 766 relative to the start codon and contained unique 3′-coding sequences and a unique 3′-untranslated region. Expression of the clone C isoform in COS cells resulted in a protein that was glycosylated and immunoreactive to anti-PPT2 antibodies but catalytically inactive in the palmitoyl-CoA assay (data not shown). The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences for clone B (Fig. 1) are shown in Fig. 2. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA sequence contains 302 amino acid residues. The initial 27 amino acids constitute a leader peptide (Fig.2, panel A, underlined) as predicted from the algorithm of von Heijne (21von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar) using the PSORT protein analysis program (22Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1368) Google Scholar). A sequence motif characteristic of many thioesterases and lipases (Ψ-X-Ψ-X-Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly-Gly-X-X-Ψ, where Ψ represents a hydrophobic residue (23Derewenda Z.S. Sharp A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar)) is present at residues 105–117, with two exceptions; a cysteine replaces the first glycine at residue 109, and a cysteine replaces the final hydrophobic amino acid at position 117. No discernible second thioesterase motif (Gly-Asp-His (24Naggert J. Witkowski A. Mikkelsen J. Smith S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1146-1150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) is present. Five potential N-linked glycosylation sites are found at amino acid residues 60, 190, 206, 245, and 289. Aside from the homology to PPT1, no other significant homologies to known proteins were uncovered using the BLAST algorithm. However, exact homology to sequences in a 300-kb region of the human class III major histocompatibility complex locus (Genome Sequence Database accession number U89336) reveal that the PPT2 gene can be tentatively localized to human chromosome 6p21.3. Upon examination of this genomic sequence, we observe that clone C in Fig. 1 is an alternatively spliced form of PPT2 in which the final exon of PPT2 is skipped and the penultimate PPT2 exon is spliced into a gene that encodes a previously uncharacterized homolog of the latent transforming growth factor-ॆ-binding protein (LTBP). The splicing event occurs out of frame with respect to the LTBP reading frame, resulting in a novel 46 amino acids that replace 47 amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of the predicted PPT2 protein (Fig. 1, clone C, shaded box). A further six exons of the LTBP-homologous gene comprise the novel 3′-untranslated region of clone C. The entire clone C sequence (not shown) will be deposited with the Genome Sequence Data base. Fig. 3 shows a comparison of PPT2 with the published sequence of human PPT1 (14Schriner J.E. Yi W. Hofmann S.L. Genomics. 1996; 34: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The overall length of the protein, exclusive of leader peptide (275 amino acid residues), is similar to that of PPT1 (281 residues). Short contiguous regions of identical amino acid residues (shown in black boxes) are present throughout, and the overall sequence identity at the amino acid level is 187. RNA blot hybridization (Fig. 4) of human tissues using the clone C PPT2 cDNA (excluding the 5′-untranslated region) as a probe (Fig. 1) showed a predominant 2.0-kb transcript and variable amounts of 2.8- and 7.0-kb transcripts in the tissues examined, with the highest expression in skeletal muscle. Interestingly, PPT1 expression is strikingly low in skeletal muscle (14Schriner J.E. Yi W. Hofmann S.L. Genomics. 1996; 34: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting a possible reciprocal relationship between PPT1 and PPT2 expression in some tissues. When the RNA blot shown in Fig. 4 was reprobed with sequences from various regions in clones A, B, and C (Fig. 1), the pattern of hybridization suggested that the major 2.0-kb mRNA encodes the active form of the enzyme (represented by clones A and B in Fig. 1) and that the 2.8-kb transcript encodes the inactive, alternatively spliced form (represented by clone C in Fig. 1) (data not shown). The origin of the 7.0-kb transcript remains to be determined. To characterize the activity and properties of the human PPT2 enzyme, we amplified the entire coding region of clone A in Fig. 1 using synthetic oligonucleotides in a polymerase chain reaction. The amplified fragment was subcloned into a eukaryotic expression vector pCMV5 to yield the plasmid pCMV5-hPPT2, and expression in transiently transfected COS-1 cells was assessed by immunoblotting and enzyme assays. Immunoblotting of crude cell lysates of COS cells expressing recombinant PPT2 showed six immunoreactive bands, ranging in size from 31 to 42 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 1). No specific signals were observed using cells transfected with vector alone or with preimmune serum (data not shown). Incubation of the cell lysates with PNGase F, a treatment that removes asparagine-linked oligosaccharides, resulted in the collapse of all the bands to yield a single major band of 31 kDa and a minor band of 33 kDa (Fig. 5,lane 2). The 31-kDa band is in excellent agreement with the size predicted for the expressed protein after removal of the leader sequence (31 kDa). Treatment with Endo H to release high-mannose and hybrid-type oligosaccharides from the polypeptide, also gave similar results to PNGase F treatment (Fig. 5, lane 3). These results are consistent with the presence of high mannose or hybrid-type asparagine-linked oligosaccharide moieties attached to recombinant PPT2. Fig. 6 shows that recombinant PPT2 possesses thioesterase activity using palmitoyl-CoA as a substrate. A pH curve obtained using lysates from vector- or pCMV5-hPPT2-transfected COS-1 cells shows that the pH optimum of PPT2 is broad, with peak activity at 7.0 and half-maximal activity between 4.5 and 5.0. This neutral pH optimum was als"

The myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes syndrome, most frequently associated with an A to G transition mutation at position 3243 of the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR)gene, is characterized by biochemical and structural alterations of mitochondria. To investigate the pathophysiology of the mutation, we established distinct Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-cell lines for analyses that harbored 30–707 of the mutated genome. Interestingly, neither an alteration of the processing of primary transcripts nor a general impairment of individual mitochondrial protein subunit synthesis rates could be observed. Nevertheless a marked decrease of cytochrome-c oxidase activity and reduced content of mitochondrial encoded subunits in the assembled respiratory complex IV was recorded on the cell line harboring 707 mutated mtDNA. Quantitative analysis of incorporation rates of the amino acid leucine into newly synthesized mitochondrial proteins, representing the functionality of the tRNALeu(UUR) in protein biosynthesis, revealed a specific decrease of this amino acid in distinct mitochondrial translation products.

Our results suggest that the malfunctioning mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) leads to an alteration of amino acid incorporation into the mitochondrially synthesized subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system, thus altering it's structure and function. Mitochondrial encephalomyopathies are often associated with a variety of alterations of the mitochondrial DNA (1Wallace D.C. Lott M.T. Brown M.D. Hupuonen K. Torroni A. Cuticchia A.J. Human Gene Mapping: A Compendium. John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore1995: 910-954Google Scholar). The investigation of potential pathogenic mutations in the mitochondrial genome has revealed a complex relationship between patient's genotype and the clinically defined multisystemic disorders (2Wallace D.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1175-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). One of the best characterized diseases is the MELAS 1The abbreviations used are: MELAS, myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; oligo, oligonucleotide; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]glycine; RFLP restriction fragment length polymorphism. 1The abbreviations used are: MELAS, myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, stroke-like episodes; OXPHOS, oxidative phosphorylation; EBV, Epstein-Barr virus; oligo, oligonucleotide; COX, cytochrome c oxidase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; bis-tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)-propane-1,3-diol; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl) ethyl]glycine; RFLP restriction fragment length polymorphism. syndrome (mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes) (3Pavlakis S.G. Phillips P.C. DiMauro S. De Vivo D.C. Rowland L.P. Ann. Neurol. 1984; 16: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). Characterized by biochemical and morphological abnormalities of muscle mitochondria, the MELAS syndrome has been linked to multiple mitochondrial DNA alterations (4Tanaka M. Ino H. Ohno K. Ohbayashi T. Ikebe S. Sano T. Ichiki T. Kobayashi M. Wada Y. Ozawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 174: 861-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 5Kobayashi M. Morishita H.

Nature. 1990; 348: 651-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Although mutations in protein genes have been reported to be associated with the disease, single base replacements in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene have been identified to play the key role in developing this devastating disorder. Among the tRNALeu(UUR) mutations, the pathogenic mechanism of the A to G transition mutation at position 3243 is discussed controversially in the literature. Embedded in the middle of a tridecamer sequence necessary for the formation of the 3′ ends of the 16 S ribosomal RNA, a severe impairment of 16 S transcription termination has been demonstrated in vitro (7Hess J.F. Parisi M.A. Bennett J.L. Clayton D.A. Nature. 1991; 351: 236-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The molecular defect in patients presenting the mutation could be the inability to produce the correct type and quantity of rRNA relative to other mitochondrial transcripts. Cytoplasmic transfer experiments, performed with mitochondria harboring the 3243 mutation and fused to a cell line devoid of endogenous mtDNA, showed a decreased synthesis rate of mitochondrial translational products in steady-state levels and the appearance of a novel RNA species (termed RNA 19), derived from transcription of the 16 S rRNA/tRNALeu(UUR)/ND1 gene (8Schon E.A. Koga Y. Davidson M. Moraes C.T. King M.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1101: 206-209PubMed Google Scholar). In a similar approach performed on a mutation at position 3302 in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene, mitochondrial RNA processing appears to be tissue-specific; while an unprocessed RNA 19 was detectable in muscle cells, this transcript was not detected in fibroblasts, implying that a tissue-specific mitochondrial RNA processing contributes to the generation of RNA 19 (9Bindoff L.A. Howell N. Poulton J. McCullough D.A. Morten K.J. Lightowlers R.N. Turnbull D.M. Weber K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19559-19564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, RNA transfer hybridization experiments on transformed cells harboring the 3243 mutation revealed no significant change in the steady-state level of the two rRNA species encoded upstream of the termination motif and of the mRNA species encoded downstream to the mutation (10Chomyn A. Martinuzzi A. Yoneda M. Daga A. Hurko O. Johns D. Lai S.T. Nonaka I. Angelini C. Attardi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4221-4225Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). Thus, the suggested pathogenic mechanisms seems to be inconclusive. To investigate the pathophysiology of the 3243 mutation, we established distinct EBV-transformed B-cell lines that harbored 30–707 of the mutated genome. Interestingly, neither an alteration of quality nor quantity of the primary transcripts could be observed. In addition, our experiments carried out on mitochondrial translation revealed no impairment of overall mitochondrial protein synthesis rate, although specific OXPHOS complexes exhibited a marked decrease of enzyme activity and assembly of mitochondrial subunits of the cell line harboring 707 mutated mtDNA. Quantitative analysis of incorporation of the amino acid leucine, monitoring the functionality of the tRNALeu(UUR) in protein biosynthesis, revealed a specific decrease of this amino acid in mitochondrially encoded and synthesized protein subunits. This observation was supported by heteroplasmic variations in the proteolytic fingerprint pattern of these subunits in the assembled OXPHOS-complexes. Our results are leading us to the hypothesis that the crucial step in molecular pathogenicity of MELAS is an alteration of the translation process at the mitochondrial ribosomes, induced by the malfunctioning mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR). These alterations are leading to reduced amino acid leucine incorporation into the mitochondrially synthesized subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation system, thus altering their structure and function. Cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Additional materials used in molecular biological studies were obtained from Perkin-Elmer (PCR), U.S. Biochemical Corp. (DNA sequencing), Boehringer Mannheim (Northern hybridization, RFLP analyses, reverse transcription), or Amersham Buchler (radiochemicals). Human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines were established by isolation of lymphocytes from blood of patients presenting with MELAS syndrome and controls. The EBV-transformed lymphocytes (11Reedman B.M. Pope J.H. Moss D.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1972; 9: 172-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) were grown in glucose-rich media (RPMI 1640), supplemented with 107 fetal calf serum, 50 ॖg/ml uridine, and 100 ॖg/ml pyruvate. Standard enzymatic assays for OXPHOS enzymes were performed as described previously (12Taylor R.W. Birch Machin M.A. Bartlett K. Turnbull D.M. Biochim. Biophys.

Anal. Biochem. 1984; 137: 360-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Briefly 1 × 107 cells were either resuspended in cell culture medium or prepared by digitonin treatment according to Granger and Lehninger (15Granger D.L. Lehninger A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in the appropriate assay buffer, and mitochondrial respiration was determined using a small scale Clarke-type oxygen electrode (Biolytic MS1;RE K1–1N) (16Nakamura M.

As reference enzyme for oxidative phosphorylation, cytochrome-c oxidase activity was additionally assayed by evaluating the turnover number using reversed Eadie-Hofstee plotting (18Zimmermann P. Kadenbach B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1180: 99-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Total DNA was extracted from 1 × 106cultured cells using a standard SDS/proteinase K protocol (19Seibel P. Degoul F. Bonne G. Romero N. Francois D. Paturneau-Jouas M. Ziegler F. Eymard B. Fardeau M.

Nature. 1981; 290: 457-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (7491) Google Scholar). Sequencing of patient and control tRNA and protein coding genes was performed by cycle sequencing according to the manufacturers' instructions. DNA genotypes were assessed by quantitative RFLP analysis. For this purpose, the amplified DNA fragments were purified and subjected to one further PCR cycle with the corresponding 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides to eliminate the interference of heteroduplex DNA on quantitative restriction enzyme cleavage. The amount of mutated DNA was detected by RFLP analysis using the restriction endonuclease BstNI. Quantitative evaluation of the heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA was carried out on excised DNA bands from agarose gels and subsequent scintillation counting. A series of wild-type/mutant DNA mixtures served as standard. cDNA synthesis of mitochondrial RNA was carried out according to the method described by Janke and Päabo (21Janke A. Päabo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1523-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using the reverse oligonucleotide for first strand DNA synthesis. Purification of RNA was achieved by DNase I treatment prior to reverse transcription. cDNA was amplified by adding the corresponding forward oligonucleotides and performing a PCR amplification for 38 cycles according to the conditions described above. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the amplified cDNA was carried out as described for DNA genotyping. Incubation of DNase-treated RNA with RNase A prior to reverse transcription served as control and led to no PCR amplification product. Total cellular RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 cells and quantitated by spectrophotometry and enzyme-linked antibody assay (dip-stick, Invitrogen). 2 ॖg of RNA were denatured by glyoxal/dimethyl sulfoxide (22Bantle J.A. Hahn W.E. Cell. 1976; 8: 139-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and separated on 1–47 agarose (Seakem, Nusieve; FMC Bioproducts). RNA was transferred to positively charged nylon membranes by vacuum blotting (23Olszewska E. Jones K. Trends Genet. 1988; 4: 92-94Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed according to standard conditions (24Meinkoth J. Wahl G. Anal.

The starvation medium was specifically formulated using the RPMI 1640 minus medium (deficient in arginine, cysteine, glutamine, leucine, and methionine) (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the conditions described by the supplier, thereby depleting the amino acids that will be subsequently used to label the proteins. To shut down cytoplasmic protein synthesis, 130 ॖg/ml cycloheximide were added, and incubation was continued for an additional 10 min. The labeling reaction was initiated by adding the following amino acids: for 35S labeling a mixture of 707l-[35S]methionine, 307l-[35S]cysteine; >1000 Ci/mm(Pro-MixTM, Amersham Corp.) was used. 3H labeling was performed by adding 700 kBq/ml eitherl-[5-3H]leucine (120–190 Ci/mmol) orl-[4,5-3H]lysine orl-[2,3,4,5,6-3H]phenylalanine. The labeling reactions were performed for 30 min (only using the35S-amino-acids to measure the rate of protein synthesis) or for 3 h (using also 3H-labeled amino acids to evaluate their rates of incorporation) at 37 °C, followed by a 20-min chase with standard medium, containing 130 ॖg/ml cycloheximide and the 4-fold concentrations of the depleted amino acids. After washing the cells twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, the labeled cells were processed for subsequent analysis. For denaturing SDS-PAGE (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), 1 × 107 cells were resuspended in a 10-fold volume of 10 mm bis-tris/HCl, pH 7, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1.0 ॖg/ml aprotinin. After addition of 50 units/ml DNase I, the suspension was kept at 25 °C for 1 h, dissolved in detergent buffer (750 mmaminocaproic acid, 50 mm bis-tris/HCl, pH 7.0, and 17 laurylmaltoside), and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 ×g. Protein concentration was determined according to a Lowry assay kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Pierce). 100–150 ॖg of protein (approximately 4 × 106 dpm) were mixed with loading buffer (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10410) Google Scholar), incubated at 40 °C for 10 min, and used for 12.57 T/37 C SDS-PAGE on a 1.5 × 120 × 230-mm vertical SIGMA electrophoresis unit. For native PAGE separation of mitochondrial OXPHOS complexes, 5 × 107 cells were resuspended in isolation buffer (28Bourgeron T. Chretien D. Amati P. Rotig A. Munnich A. Rustin P. Neuromuscul. Disord. 1993; 3: 605-608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and homogenized with a tight fitting glass-Teflon potter. After two centrifugation steps at 2,500 and 15,000 × g the mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 750 mm aminocaproic acid, 50 mmbis-tris/HCl, pH 7.0, and 17 laurylmaltoside and centrifuged as described above. The supernatant was supplemented with Coomassie Blue G-250 and loaded on a 7–167 linear gradient gel system (29Schagger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). The separated mitochondrial proteins were electroblotted on 0.1-ॖm nitrocellulose membranes by semi-dry blotting (Schleicher & Schüll) in a discontinuous buffer system (30Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 199: 223-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). After denaturing SDS-gel electrophoresis and subsequent electroblotting as described above, the individual protein subunits were localized by autoradiographic detection (24 h exposure to Kodak Biomax MR film) and isolated by excision. For scintillation counting, the nitrocellulose membranes were dissolved in 2 ml of acetonitrile and resuspended in 8 ml of scintillation solution (Insta-Fluor; Canberra Packard). The fractions were analyzed for their 3H and 35S content by spectral scintillation counting. The relative proportions of incorporated amino acids were calculated by using the following calibration: reference spectra of each single radioisotope were recorded under identical experimental conditions, and spectrum-specific channels for 35S and 3H were defined. An experimental correction factor was applied on 35S radiation recorded within the 3H window. The proteolytic digestion pattern of the mitochondrial subunits was performed by a modification of the protocol of Cleveland and colleagues (31Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After separation of whole cell lysates in the first dimension, mitochondrial subunits were excised and incubated for 10 min in 200 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 0.17 SDS, 107 glycerol. The SDS gel for separation in the second dimension was prepared as described but using preparative combs and 0.057 SDS in the stacking gel and cathode buffer. 25 ॖg of endoproteinase Glu-C (Boehringer Mannheim) was dissolved in 200 mm ammonium carbonate, 0.0257 SDS, 107 glycerol, pH 8.9, 0.00017 bromphenol blue. After loading, electrophoresis was performed until the endoproteinase had entered the gel. The excised gel fragments were positioned in the sample slots between the gel plates and overlaid by another portion of the endoproteinase solution containing 35 ॖg of endoproteinase Glu-C. Electrophoresis was resumed until the marker reached the end of the stacking gel. After a pause of 30 min, electrophoresis was again resumed and continued to its end. The cleavage pattern was visualized by autoradiography of the blotted gel as described above. To elucidate the pathogenic mechanism underlying the A to G transition mutation in the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene at position 3243, we established EBV-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients carrying heteroplasmic populations of the mutated genome. After initial screening, two stable cell lines were obtained, harboring 30 and 707 mutated DNA. These were subjected to biochemical and genetic analyses. While enzymatic activities and polarographic studies of cells presenting with 307 mutant genome showed no significant differences in activity (data not shown), cells harboring 707 mutated DNA exhibited significant reduction in cytochrome-c oxidase, with other OXPHOS enzyme activities lying at the lower limit of standard deviation (see TableII). These data were supported by polarographic studies carried out on permeabilized cells; whereas respiration capacity from cells with 307 mutation rate were almost indistinguishable from control cells, a 207 reduction in oxygen consumption was recorded for permeabilized cells harboring 707 mutated genome (see Fig. 1).Table IIEnzyme kinetics (n = 10) of mitochondrial reference enzymes (units/g protein) measured in whole cell extracts of patient and control using standard assays as referred to under 舠Materials and Methods.舡Enzymes707 patient, ± S.D.Control, ± S.D.units/gunits/gNADH dehydrogenase41.2 ± 0.348.0 ± 4.0NADH cytochrome c reductase8.1 ± 1.810.6 ± 3.2Succinate dehydrogenase4.8 ± 0.55.4 ± 0.0Succinate cytochrome c reductase7.7 ± 0.89.8 ± 1.5Cytochrome c oxidase2.5 ± 1.15.8 ± 1.0Citrate synthase5.3 ± 0.95.9 ± 1.1 Open table in a new tab To prove whether malfunctioning enzymes are responsible for the observed abnormalities, we decided to measure the turnover number of cytochrome-c oxidase as a marker for enzyme integrity. The analysis of cytochrome-c oxidase activity under different concentrations of cytochrome-c revealed a significantly decreased turnover number of the enzyme at low substrate concentrations in cells presenting with 707 mutated genotype (see Fig.2). To exclude that an additional mitochondrial DNA variation could contribute to this effect, the mitochondrial encoded COX genes were sequenced (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡). By comparing the obtained sequence to the published sequence, no variation was identified that could account for the enzymatic alterations. Hence, the altered enzyme integrity must be related to the mutation in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene itself. To determine whether the mutation in the tRNALeu(UUR) gene influences the transcript level of mutated and wild-type tRNA in heteroplasmic cells, we analyzed the degree of heteroplasmy on DNA, tRNA, and primary RNA transcript level by RFLP analysis (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡). The quantitative determination of the proportion of mutated versus wild-type nucleic acids in patient's cells revealed corresponding levels so that for each cell line the amount of mutated DNA (genotype) matched its transcript level (see Fig. 3 a). This was observed for the primary transcripts as well as for their processed counterparts. Hence, neither a malfunctioning processing of primary transcripts nor a difference in stability of the mutatedversus the wild-type tRNA could be observed. To verify that the ratio of mitochondrial to nuclear transcripts was unaltered, mitochondrial and nuclear expression levels were characterized by Northern analyses. A difference in mitochondrial RNA contents was not detectable for primary transcripts of rRNAs or mRNAs, or processed ribosomal RNA, or mature tRNAs (Fig.3 b). There was no detectable accumulation of a precursor-like abnormal primary transcript (termed RNA 19) as has been described for ρ° cells with a high percentage of altered mtDNA (32King M.P. Koga Y. Davidson M. Schon E.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 480-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). Although levels of mutant and wild-type transcripts showed no alteration, further analyses were extended onto the mitochondrial translation process. The reduced enzyme activities could be caused by two effects: a reduction in the abundance of enzymes or by malfunctioning components of the complexes. Thus, mitochondrial protein labeling experiments were carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 Evaluation of the protein synthesis rates of cells affected by 707 mutation expressed no differences in the amounts of mitochondrial subunits (see Fig.4 for laser densitometric scanning of the protein banding pattern). This result was underlined by experiments utilizing a 30-, 60-, and 180-min pulse. Neither condition applied resulted in an alteration of our primary result. Hence, neither the rate of synthesis (represented by a 30-min pulse) nor the accumulation of peptides in stable complexes (as monitored by the 180-min pulse) revealed significant differences. Hence, at least up to levels of 707 mutated genotype, the overall protein synthesis rate of individual subunits seems not to be affected. To prove the functionality of the mutated tRNALeu(UUR)during protein synthesis, a co-labeling of mitochondrial proteins was carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine and [3H]leucine. This allowed us to evaluate the leucine and methionine/cysteine content of distinct translation products by measuring 35S and 3H radiation using defined energy windows of a scintillation counter (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡). While patient's and control's mitochondrial translation products displayed similar apparent molecular weights on SDS-PAGE, incorporation of 3H (representing leucine content) was more abundant in translation products from controls, when compared with those from the MELAS cell lines. Furthermore, the decrease in 3H incorporation was more abundant in cells harboring 707 mutated genome than in cells exhibiting only 307 mutant genotype (see Fig. 5). No traces of premature terminated translation products were detected. Although reduction in 3H content was most extensively seen in the translation products of ND3 and ND6, it was only moderately developed in the ND4L translation product (see Fig. 5). To analyze if the altered peptides participate in the assembly of the OXPHOS complexes, we utilized blue native gel electrophoresis to separate assembled OXPHOS complexes prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. These qualitative and quantitative analyses of assembled OXPHOS complexes were carried out by using mitochondrial fractions derived from digitonin-permeabilized cells. No differences in the relative amount of the individual OXPHOS enzyme complexes between the more severely affected MELAS cell line and wild-type cells could be observed. After separation of the assembled mitochondrial subunits by second dimension SDS-PAGE, no differences in the relative amount of nearly all mitochondrially encoded subunits were detectable. However, an altered pattern of mitochondrial encoded subunits of respiratory complex IV could be observed in the mutated cells (see Fig.6). Analysis of mitochondrial encoded and co-labeled smaller subunits isolated from this gel system also showed a significant [3H]leucine reduction in the 707 cell line relative to controls, monitoring assembly of altered subunits in the OXPHOS complexes. To prove that the defect was tRNALeu(UUR)-specific and to evaluate the possibility of conservative substitution of the UUR-encoded leucine by phenylalanine, encoded by the"
https://openalex.org/W1973890680,"The homeobox gene GBX2 was identified as a target gene of the v-Myb oncoprotein encoded by the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV). GBX2 activation by c-Myb requires signal transduction emanating from the cell surface while the leukemogenic AMV v-Myb constitutively induces the GBX2 gene. Mutations in the DNA binding domain of AMV-Myb render it independent of signaling events and concomitantly abrogate the collaboration between Myb and CCAAT Enhancer Binding Proteins (C/EBP), which are involved in granulocyte differentiation. Ectopic expression of GBX2 in growth factor-dependent myeloblasts induces monocytic features and independence from exogenous cytokines, reflecting distinct features of AMV-transformed cells. Our results suggest that Myb or factors it interacts with contribute to hematopoietic lineage choice and differentiation in a signal transduction-dependent fashion."

We report here that elimination of phosphorylation of a chemoattractant receptor ofDictyostelium, either by site-directed substitution of the serines or by truncation of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain, completely prevented agonist-induced loss of ligand binding but didnot impair the adaptation of several receptor-mediated responses including the activation of adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases and actin polymerization. In addition, the phosphorylation-deficient receptors were capable of mediating chemotaxis, aggregation, and differentiation. We propose that for chemoattractant receptors agonist-induced phosphorylation regulates surface binding activity but other phosphorylation-independent mechanisms mediate response adaptation.

A diverse array of hormones, neurotransmitters, and environmental stimuli are sensed by cell surface receptors that transduce the signals to heterotrimeric G-proteins 1The abbreviations used are: G-protein, guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; cAR, cAMP receptor; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; DTT, dithiothreitol; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate. within the cell (1Dohlman H.G.

Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 604-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This extensive family of receptors shares a number of structural and functional features (3Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). All of the members contain seven transmembrane domains that undergo conformation changes upon ligand binding, revealing G-protein coupling domains in the cytoplasmic loops of the receptors. In this activated state, these receptors promote the exchange of GDP bound to heterotrimeric G-proteins with GTP and, thereby, initiate downstream signaling. Termination of this signaling is critical in order for cells to respond to graded stimuli. The GTPase activity of the G-protein, assisted in some instances by RGS proteins (regulators of G-protein signaling), terminates the response once the excitatory input from the receptor is removed. In addition, multiple desensitization mechanisms exist that serve to attenuate responses despite persistent stimulation (4Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). First, there is a rapid functional uncoupling of these receptors from G-proteins. Second, the ability of receptors to bind ligand can be diminished due to modulation of their affinity (5Caterina M.J. Hereld D. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4418-4423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) or to becoming inaccessible through 舠sequestration舡 or internalization. Last, prolonged exposure to ligand leads to an actual reduction of receptor levels (down-regulation), the consequence of accelerated degradation and/or diminished transcription. In the case of ॆ-adrenergic receptors and rhodopsin, uncoupling is attributed to receptor phosphorylation on cytoplasmic C-terminal domain serines/threonines by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases, followed by the stoichiometric association of the phosphoreceptors with arrestins (6Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor kinase/arrestin paradigm, however, may not be the only means for response termination as other points in the pathway could be regulated to effect adaptation. The social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum provides an excellent model system for genetic analysis of G-protein-coupled receptors (7Devreotes P.N. Neuron. 1994; 12: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Starvation initiates a developmental program in which thousands of free living amoebae aggregate and differentiate to form a multicellular structure containing spores. A family of four sequentially expressed G-protein-coupled cAMP receptors (cARs) are essential at distinct stages in development. cAR1 mediates three principal physiological responses during aggregation including chemotaxis, cell-to-cell relay of the cAMP signal, and regulation of gene expression (8Sun T.J. Devreotes P.N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The activation of heterotrimeric G-proteins by cAR1 and the sequence of events following this activation are highly analogous to those occurring in mammalian cells. Many cAR1-mediated responses exhibit adaptation (9Caterina M.J. Devreotes P.N. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 3078-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For example, receptor-mediated activation of adenylyl cyclase reaches a peak in 1 min and then subsides within 5–10 min despite continued stimulation. When the stimulus is removed, the cells regain sensitivity with a half-time of a few minutes. cAMP-induced cell shape changes, actin polymerization, cGMP synthesis, and myosin heavy and light chain phosphorylations also adapt in a similar fashion. However, the kinetics of these responses differ from one another, suggesting the involvement of multiple independent adaptation processes. The requirement for pulses of extracellular cAMP to induce expression of a number of genes during aggregation suggests that the mechanism by which cAR1 regulates gene expression is also subject to adaptation. Adaptation of many of these responses is closely correlated with cAR1 phosphorylation (10Vaughan R.A. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14538-14543Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Increments in stimuli augment cAR1 phosphorylation, which reaches a steady-state level as the responses subside. When the stimulus is removed, the extent of phosphorylation declines and, concomitantly, the cells regain sensitivity. Saturating stimuli result in the modification of 3 to 4 serines in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (11Klein P. Vaughan R. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 358-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of either Ser-303 or Ser-304 results in a discrete shift in cAR1's electrophoretic mobility and is highly correlated with an agonist-induced decrease in the receptor's affinity (12Caterina M.J. Devreotes P.N. Borleis J. Hereld D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8667-8672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to determine the role of the agonist-induced cAR1 phosphorylation in adaptation of several chemoattractant-mediated processes in vivo. Our results have led us to the unexpected conclusion that phosphorylation of cAR1 is not essential for the termination of any of the responses we tested, including agonist-induced adenylyl cyclase activation, actin polymerization, chemotaxis, and gene expression. Therefore, there must be a novel phosphorylation-independent adaptation mechanism (or mechanisms) that attenuate these responses. cAR1 mutant cm1234, generated by site-directed mutagenesis as described previously (13Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lacks all 18 serines of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. In brief, the 10 serines in clusters 1, 2, and 4 (as defined in Ref. 13Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were substituted with either glycine or alanine. The 8 serines of cluster 3 and an intervening leucine were deleted. A second mutant, T289, created by exonuclease III-mediated deletion of a cAR1 cDNA, is truncated after Leu-289, eliminating most of the C-terminal domain including all of its serine residues. Its new C terminus includes the vector-encoded peptide GEEFD. Both mutant cDNAs were subcloned into the G418-selectable, extrachromosomal expression vector pJK1 (14Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J.

Acar1 − /car3 − cell line, designated RI9, was derived from JB4 cells (15Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in two steps. Each of two cAR1 loci in JB4 cells is, in part, replaced with a selectablePYR5–6 gene fragment. First, both PYR5–6fragments were eliminated by homologous recombination using an internally deleted cAR1 fragment (i.e. the predecessor of pMC25; Ref. 15Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yielding the car1 − uracil auxotroph, JB5. Finally, cAR3 was disrupted in JB5 cells to yield RI9 cells using the prototrophy-restoring construct 5cAR3ura as described previously (16Johnson R.L. Saxe C.L. Gollop R. Kimmel A.R. Devreotes P.N.

Receptor expression constructs from above were introduced into RI9 cells by electroporation. Clonal transformants were selected for and maintained in HL5 medium (17Watts D. Ashworth J. Biochem.

Unless noted otherwise, experiments were conducted with cells grown in a shaken suspension to 5 × 106 cells/ml, washed with DB (5 mm KH2PO4, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mm MgSO4, 0.2 mm CaCl2), and developed (i.e.starved) for 5 h at 2 × 107 cells/ml of DB with shaking (120 rpm) and pulsatile cAMP addition (50–100 nm) every 6 min.

Labeled cells were extracted for 5 min with ice-cold 17 CHAPS in ERB (13Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and centrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min at 10,000 rpm in a Sorvall SS-34 rotor. After two additional CHAPS extractions, the pellets that contained cAR1 were solubilized in sample buffer and 107 cell equivalents of each were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 157 舠low bis舡 gel (0.0737 w/v bis-acrylamide). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis-resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane and probed with antiserum directed against the peptide sequence KREPEPERFEKY in the second intracellular loop of cAR1 (provided by M. Caterina). Primary antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham) and chemiluminescence (DuPont). Residual chemiluminescence was then quenched by washing the blot with 0.027 sodium azide for 15 min, and autoradiography was performed overnight to detect the32Pi incorporated into the receptors. Growth-stage cells were washed with PB (5 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm Na2HPO4), resuspended at 3 × 107 cells/ml in PB containing 5 mm caffeine (to prevent spontaneous activation of adenylyl cyclase), and shaken for 30 min at room temperature. Caffeine-treated cells were washed with ice-cold PB and resuspended at a density of 108 cells/ml. cAMP binding assays were performed as described before, separating cell bound and unbound cAMP by centrifugation through oil (18Van Haastert P.J.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 124: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Scatchard data were analyzed using the program LIGAND. For the loss of ligand binding measurements, caffeine-treated and washed cells were further treated with PB alone or with 10 ॖm cAMP in the presence of 10 mm DTT for 15 min. The cells were then diluted 20-fold with ice-cold PB, rapidly washed 4 times in the same buffer, and resuspended at 108 cells/ml. Their saturable cAMP binding was then measured with 16 nm [3H]cAMP (15Caterina M.J. Milne J.L.S. Devreotes P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1523-1532Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cAMP-induced synthesis and secretion of [3H]cAMP was assayed by the perfusion method previously described (19Devreotes P.N. Derstine P.L. Steck T.L. J. Cell Biol. 1979; 80: 291-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Vegetative amoebae were fed with [3H]adenosine-labeled bacteria in a shaken suspension and then allowed to develop for 5–8 h on DB agar plates. The cells were then transferred to filters, perfused with DB with or without cAMP at a flow rate of 10 drops/min. Effluent (1 min fractions) was collected into test tubes preloaded with 20 ॖl of stop solution (0.2m HCl, 1 mm cAMP, 50 mm DTT). [3H]cAMP was isolated by Dowex and alumina chromatography and quantitated by scintillation counting. The adenylyl cyclase 舠activation trap舡 assay was performed as described previously (20Pupillo M. Insall R. Pitt G.S. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Developed cells were treated for 30 min with 5 mm caffeine and washed 4 times with ice-cold PM (5 mmKH2PO4, 5 mmNa2HPO4, 2 mm MgSO4). The cells (8 × 107 cells/ml) were then stimulated at 22 °C with 10 ॖm cAMP and aliquots were lysed at the indicated times. The amount of [α-32P]ATP converted to [32P]cAMP by each lysate in 1 min was measured. cGMP accumulation resulting from guanylyl cyclase activation was measured as described previously (21Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2301-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cells were developed for 5 h, brought to a basal state by dilution and rapid shaking (20Pupillo M. Insall R. Pitt G.S. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and then stimulated with 10 nm cAMP or 5 ॖm 2′-deoxy-cAMP in shaking culture at 22 °C. At designated times, aliquots of cells were removed and lysed with perchloric acid (final 3.57). Samples were neutralized with KHCO3 (507 saturated at 22 °C), and the amount of cGMP was measured by a competitive radioimmunoassay (Amersham). Developed cells were prepared as described for the adenylyl cyclase activation trap assay, resuspended in PM buffer at 3 × 107 cells/ml. Cells were kept on ice until just prior to experiments, and then they were warmed to room temperature by shaking for 10 min. At time 0, 100 nm cAMP was added to stimulate cAMP-induced actin polymerization in vivo. At the indicated times, 100-ॖl aliquots of cells were combined with 1 ml of fixing solution (3.77 formaldehyde, 10 mm Pipes, 0.17 Triton X-100, 20 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 250 nm TRITC-phalloidin, pH 6.8), which served to permeabilize the cells, fix, and stain F-actin (22Condeelis J. Hall A.L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 196: 486-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After staining for 1 h at room temperature, fixed cells were centrifuged (14,000 rpm, 5 min). TRITC-phalloidin was then extracted from the pellet with methanol (1 ml) and quantitated by fluorimetry (540-nm excitation, 575-nm emission). Chemotaxis was measured by the small population assay (23Konijn T.M. Experientia (Basel). 1970; 26: 367-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were developed in shaking culture for 6 h with 100 nm cAMP pulses and diluted to 2 × 106 cells/ml with DB. Droplets (∼0.1 ॖl) containing 100–200 cells were spotted with a microcapillary tube adjacent to droplets of varying cAMP concentration on 17 agar plates containing DB and 3 mm caffeine. After 10–20 min in a humidified chamber, cell drops were examined for chemotaxis. Chemotactic responses were scored positive if at least twice as many amoebae were pressed against the edge nearest the cAMP droplet compared with the opposite edge. For each of the conditions, total cellular RNA was isolated from 2.5 × 107 cells as described by Nellen et al. (24Nellen W. Datta S. Reymond C. Sivertsen A. Mann S. Crowley T. Firtel R.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1987; 28: 67-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), size fractionated on 1.57 agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, and transferred to nylon membranes. Northern transfers were hybridized to [32P]dATP-labeled probes according to standard procedures and exposed to x-ray film. To test the role of phosphorylation in regulation of receptor function, we constructed two mutant forms of cAR1. In cm1234, all 18 serines of the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain were either substituted or deleted (13Hereld D. Vaughan R. Kim J.Y. Borleis J. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7036-7044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas in T289 the C-terminal 105 amino acid residues were deleted including all of the serines in the cytoplasmic domain. Wild-type and mutant receptors were expressed constitutively under the control of the actin-15 promoter in cells lacking both cAR1 and cAR3 genes. We elected to use car1 − /car3 −because cAR3 mediates some residual responses to cAMP in the absence of cAR1 (25Insall R.H. Soede R.D.M. Schaap P. Devreotes P.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 26Soede R.D.M. Insall R.H. Devreotes P.N. Schaap P. Development. 1994; 120: 1997-2002PubMed Google Scholar) and appears to be dispensable (16Johnson R.L. Saxe C.L. Gollop R. Kimmel A.R. Devreotes P.N. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, in this genetic background, the measured responses could be attributed entirely to the ectopically expressed receptors. As shown in Fig.1 A, the cells expressed relatively comparable steady-state levels of the respective receptors. However, the expression of T289 was frequently reduced to 707 of wild-type cAR1. The molecular weight of cm1234 is lower due to the deletion of 9 residues that encompass one of the clusters of serines. As we have shown previously, the cm1234 receptor does not exhibit the cAMP-induced electrophoretic mobility shift characteristic of the wild-type receptor. Similar results were obtained for T289, which exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa (Fig.1 A). To verify that cm1234 and T289 lack phosphorylation, the cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, and its incorporation into each receptor was assessed for both cAMP-stimulated and unstimulated cells. Compared with wild-type cAR1, [32P]phosphate incorporation into cm1234 or T289 was dramatically reduced; both basal and cAMP-induced phosphorylation were virtually undetectable (Fig. 1 B). These cell lines were used for analysis of the functional consequences of removing phosphorylation sites. We first performed Scatchard analysis on both wild-type and cm1234. As shown in Fig.2 A, the two receptors displayed similar K d and B maxvalues. T289 also had a similar K d although often its B max was reduced due to lower expression levels (data not shown). Thus, any observed physiological and biochemical phenotypes conferred by the mutant receptors cannot be attributed to differences in the binding characteristics. Cells expressing wild-type cAR1 exhibit 舠loss of ligand binding舡 in response to cAMP treatment. The apparent loss is due to an agonist-induced reduction in the affinity of the cell surface receptors and can be conveniently monitored with a binding experiment at a subsaturating concentration of [3H]cAMP. This process is highly correlated with phosphorylation of serine residues 303 and 304. This reduction in affinity does not merely reflect uncoupling of the phosphoreceptor from G-protein as it occurs to a normal extent in cells lacking the G-protein ॆ-subunit, confirming that it is a G-protein-independent phenomenon (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig. 2 B, the response is equally impaired for mutant receptors in the absence of the ॆ-subunit. We first examined the ability of cm1234 and T289 to support development. As was previously shown,car1 − /car3 − cells fail to aggregate, and normal development can be restored by introducing a wild-type cAR1 expressed constitutively from actin promoter (8Sun T.J. Devreotes P.N. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 572-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the cm1234 and T289 cells exhibited a relatively normal progression in development to the aggregation stage. Time-lapse video microscopy of starving cell populations on nonnutrient agar were performed as an indirect means of observing cAMP wave propagation. The influence of cAMP waves on cell shape change is apparent in time-lapse phase contrast images. Whereas waves with periodicity of 6 min were routinely observed with wild-type cells, similarly timed 舠bursts舡 were observed near aggregation centers with the nonphosphorylatable cells. However, these waves were rarely propagated as effectively as in wild type (data not shown). This suggests that some receptor-mediated responses may not be completely normal. In addition, when cm1234 or T289 are overexpressed at high levels, arrest of development at the mound stage is observed (data not shown). We are currently investigating the cause of this phenotype. Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 3, the nonphosphorylatable receptors when expressed at physiological levels can mediate normal development and produce apparently normal fruiting bodies that are comparable to those of the wild-type cAR1 expressing control cells. The ability to aggregate suggests that the mutant receptors are able to mediate chemotaxis. We therefore examined the chemotaxis of cm1234 and T289 cells toward a wide range of cAMP concentrations. As shown in Fig.4, these cells were capable of chemotaxis with a dose-response profile similar to that of cells expressing wild-type cAR1. The EC50 for chemotaxis by the mutant cell lines is about 2-fold higher than wild-type cells, and at higher cAMP concentration the response by mutant receptors declined faster than wild-type receptors. We also carried out chemotaxis assays on a series of background cAMP concentrations. In these assays, the cells are first placed on agar containing a uniform concentration of attractant. After 15 min, phosphodiesterase secreted by the cells degrades cAMP locally, and an agonist gradient extending away from the spot of cells is established. We observed no differences in the behavior of the cells expressing mutant and wild-type receptors (data not shown). Thus, chemoattractant receptor phosphorylation does not play a critical role in chemotaxis. The chemotaxis response mediated by the mutant receptors were similar to that of wild-type receptors. However, there were subtle differences in the maximal response and the width of the dose response curve. So we examined some of the responses closely associated with chemotaxis such as the rapid chemoattractant-mediated actin polymerization and activation of guanylyl cyclase. Actin polymerization is involved in the series of transient cell shape changes that occur upon addition of chemoattractant. Typically filamentous actin levels rise 2–3-fold within 6 s and then decrease to nearly base-line levels within 15 s. Concurrently, the cells cease moving and round up. Frequently a second, slower increase in F-actin occurs, peaking at 60–90 s, which coincides with a spreading of the cells on the surface. Finally, F-actin levels return to the prestimulus levels and cells resume their prestimulus randomly motile behavior. We reasoned that if receptor phosphorylation was essential for adaptation of the F-actin response, one or more of the F-actin changes would be delayed in thecar1 − /car3 − cells expressing the mutant receptors. However, as illustrated in Fig.5 A, the responses in the wild-type and mutant cells followed very similar profiles and clearly returned to base-line levels within 5 min. Another G-protein-coupled response mediated by the chemoattractant receptor is transient activation of guanylyl cyclase. As shown in Fig. 5 B, stimulation of both wild-type and cm1234 cells with 2′-deoxy-cAMP produces transient activation and accumulation of cGMP. Ten seconds after stimulation, the level of cGMP increases ten-fold returning to the basal level after 45 s. The responses mediated by wild-type and mutant receptors are indistinguishable, suggesting that in addition to the adenylyl cyclase and actin polymerization responses, the guanylyl cyclase response adapts as well. The ability of the cells to aggregate also suggested that cell-cell signaling, which depends on appropriate regulation of adenylyl cyclase, is normal. To directly assess the signaling response, an analysis of cAMP-induced cAMP secretion was performed on the cm1234 and T289 cells. As previously documented, the time-course of cAMP secretion directly reflects the state of activation of adenylyl cyclase. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the kinetics of secretion of cAMP from the cells expressing either the T289 or cm1234 were nearly identical to those of cells expressing the wild-type receptor. In all cases, cAMP elicited a transient increase in the rate of cAMP secretion that peaked after 2 min and subsided after 10 min of stimulation. In eleven similar experiments, there were no significant differences in the rate of decline in secretion between mutants and wild-type cells (Fig. 6 A). We also measured the catalytic activity of adenylyl cyclase after cAMP stimulation in an activation trap assay. For this assay, cells were stimulated with cAMP for varying lengths of time and catalytic activity was measured immediately after lysis. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the profile of activation and inactivation of the enzyme was indistinguishable between wild-type cells and the mutants. We also measured the total production of cAMP from cm1234 cells in suspension following stimulation with 2′-deoxy-cAMP, which was also transient (data not shown). Thus, under the conditions tested, the two mutant receptors appear to elicit kinetically identical responses. Therefore, there must be a cAR1 phosphorylation-independent mechanism of adaptation for this response. In addition to mediating aggregation, repeated cAMP stimuli are required for induction of a class of genes expressed in early aggregation. Treatment of cells with constant levels of cAMP, at low or high concentrations, suppresses expression of these genes. This requirement for pulsatile stimulation suggests that the pathway that leads to expression of these genes depends on a response that adapts. To determine the role of cAR1 phosphorylation in this adaptation process, we examined the induction of mRNA encoding the cell adhesion protein, contact site A incar1 − /car3 − cells expressing cm1234. As was observed with the wild-type receptor, cm1234 mediated the accumulation of contact site A mRNA in response to intermittent cAMP stimuli and also repressed its expression in response to constant cAMP (Fig.7). The pulsatile addition of cAMP at 6-min intervals was an effective inducer at 30, 300, and 900 nm, whereas continuous fluxes of the nucleotide at rates of 5, 50, and 150 nm/min all led to suppression. These results illustrate that cAR1 phosphorylation is not necessary for this adaptation process. We have demonstrated that mutant receptors that cannot undergo agonist-mediated phosphorylation can support development ofDictyostelium. In addition, they can elicit multiple responses including chemotaxis, activation of adenylyl and guanylyl cyclases, and actin polymerization. Our observations show that the tightly regulated adaptation of all of these responses does not depend on receptor phosphorylation. Thus, we have discovered that a mechanism(s) other than receptor phosphorylation terminates multiple chemoattractant receptor-mediated responses. This result was surprising in view of findings in other systems that implicate agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation in termination of a variety of responses. In transgenic mice, a truncated form of rhodopsin was found to mediate abnormally prolonged hyperpolarizations, suggesting that phosphorylation is required for the normal termination of responses to light (27Chen J. Makino C.L. Peachey N.S. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Science. 1995; 267: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Moreover, numerous studies have indicated a role for ॆ-adrenergic receptor phosphorylation in its uncoupling from G-protein and sequestration (6Inglese J. Freedman N.J. Koch W.J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23735-23738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ferguson S.S.G. Menard L. Barak L.S. Koch W.J. Colapietro A. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24782-24789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In addition, Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing truncated pheromone receptors exhibit heightened pheromone sensitivity (29Chen Q. Konopka J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 247-257Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Receptor phosphorylation might be expected to play a role in background subtraction during chemotaxis. Such a mechanism could account for the ability of wild-type cells to sense and move up shallow gradients of chemoattractant superimposed on a constant subsaturating level of stimulus (30Van Haastert P.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1559-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). If cAR1 phosphorylation was essential for this sensitivity adjustment, then chemotaxis mediated by the mutant receptors would be expected to be grossly impaired. Our results show that nonphosphorylatable mutants can mediate chemotaxis over a broad range of agonist concentrations similar to wild-type cells. Thus, background subtraction must be mediated by a phosphorylation-independent mechanism. The range of chemoattractant concentrations to which the mutant receptors can respond is narrower as shown in Fig. 3 B. This may reflect their inability to undergo the reduction of receptor affinity caused by phosphorylation. The putative phosphorylation-independent adaptation mechanism required to explain our findings could theoretically act on any site within the signal transduction pathway. Loss of ligand binding, a rapid ligand-induced reduction in cAR1 affinity, is clearly not the adaptation mechanism as cm1234 and T289 are severely impaired in this phenomenon. Other agonist-induced covalent modifications of the receptor or agonist-induced conformational change of the receptor could act as the phosphorylation-independent adaptation mechanism that we uncovered. Alternatively, a cytosolic protein might compete with the G-protein for binding to the ligand-occupied receptors. The receptor kinase itself or an arrestin might play this role. G2, the G-protein-coupled to cAR1, is known to be phosphorylated upon stimulation of cells with ligand (31Gundersen R.E. Devreotes P.N. Science. 1990; 248: 591-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, this phosphorylation is unlikely to be the primary cause of adaptation as it is transient, and the phosphorylation site in the Gα2 subunit can be eliminated without phenotypic consequence (32Chen M. Devreotes P.N. Gundersen R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20925-20930Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mounting evidence suggests that a distal component in the adenylyl cyclase pathway is a target of adaptation. GTPγS, which can activate adenylyl cyclase in lysates of sensitive cells, fails to do so in lysates of adapted cells (33Theibert A. Devreotes P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15121-15125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is correlated with a reduction in the ability of adapted cell membranes to bind CRAC, a cytosolic protein essential for adenylyl cyclase activation (34Lilly P.J. Devreotes P.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1659-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, the receptor-mediated regulation of membrane binding sites for CRAC likely plays an important role in adaptation of the adenylyl cyclase response. The existence of a pleckstrin homology domain in CRAC and its inability to bind membranes of Gॆ null cells suggest that Gॆγ dimers are a part of the binding site for CRAC and a possible target of the regulatory modification that results in adaptation (35Insall R. Kuspa A. Lilly P.J. Shaulsky G. Levin L.R. Loomis W.F. Devreotes P. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1537-1545Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although our findings reveal the existence of a phosphorylation-independent adaptation mechanism, they do not exclude the possibility that this mechanism and receptor phosphorylation are functionally redundant. Our preliminary observation thatdeadaptation of the adenylyl cyclase response is more rapid in cm1234 cells than in wild-type cells is consistent with this possibility and suggests that receptor dephosphorylation normally limits the rate of recovery from the adapted state. Further investigation will be required to clarify this possibility. Could higher eukaryotic systems possess a similar phosphorylation-independent mechanism of adaptation? Evidence for such a mechanism has not been observed in the studies of rhodopsin and ॆ-adrenergic receptors. It might possibly exist in these systems and could have been overlooked as a result of the in vitroapproaches taken, or in the case of ॆ-adrenergic receptors, the cultured cells chosen for heterologous expression. It is also possible that different receptors utilize different mechanisms of adaptation. While rhodopsin and ॆ-adrenergic receptor-mediated responses might be regulated exclusively by receptor phosphorylation, other mammalian G-protein-coupled receptors, such as chemokine receptors, might be regulated by phosphorylation-independent mechanisms like those our studies have revealed in Dictyostelium.

E-cadherin is a 120-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein whose calcium sensitive homotypic adhesion mediates epithelial cell-cell adhesion, cell polarization, and other differentiation events (2Takeichi M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 619-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Two proteins, called α-catenin 1Multiple forms of α-catenin exist representing both different gene products and alternative mRNA transcripts. The α-catenin used in this study is the common form found in epithelial cells, termed α1(E)-catenin (1Rimm D.L. Kebriaei P. Morrow J.S. Biochem. Biophys.Res. Comm. 1994; 203: 1691-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here we use the general term 舠α-catenin舡 to refer to the α1(E)-catenin molecule except where otherwise indicated. and ॆ-catenin, closely associate with the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin and connect the membrane adhesion complex to the cytoskeleton (3Rimm D.L.

Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). While it is generally appreciated that ॆ-catenin binds both E-cadherin and α-catenin, the precise molecular details of the adhesion complex and the oligomeric state of the proteins involved remains uncertain. The crystal structure of the first extracellular domain (EC-1) of N-cadherin reveals a dimeric configuration (5Shapiro L. Fannon A.M. Kwong P.D. Thompson A. Lehmann M.S. Grubel G. Legrand J.F. Als N.J. Colman D.R. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1995; 374: 327-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar), and recombinant fragments of C-cadherin also form dimers, a configuration required for productive adhesion (6Brieher W.M. Yap A.S. Gumbiner B.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 487-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). It therefore seems likely that the active state of cadherin is dimeric. The oligomeric state of the other components of the complex is more controversial. Heterodimeric complexes of α-catenin and ॆ-catenin at a 1:1 ratio have been detected by immunoprecipitation (7Ozawa M. Ringwald M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4246-4250Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 8Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and supported by yeast two-hybrid assays that detect a direct interaction between α- and ॆ-catenin (9Jou T.S. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In these assays, neither α-catenin or ॆ-catenin showed evidence for homodimerization. Yet, in studies assessing the interaction of α-catenin with F-actin, 1 catenin molecule was bound for every 7 actins (3Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Since F-actin exists as a double helical filament with 7 molecules per strand or 14 molecules per turn of the helix, we proposed that at saturation 2 α-catenins bound per turn of the helix, and suggested that α-catenin may exist as a dimer in solution. In the present study, we examine the oligomeric state of both α-catenin and ॆ-catenin in solution, as well as the state of heterocomplexes of α- and ॆ-catenin. We find that while ॆ-catenin consistently exists as a monomer under the solution conditions examined, α-catenin is dimeric. When ॆ-catenin binds, the α-catenin homodimer is partially dissociated, yielding heterodimeric complexes of α- and ॆ-catenin. These results suggest the presence of a complex interaction between ॆ-catenin and α-catenin homodimers that might include at least two distinct functional states. Full-length α- and ॆ-catenin clones were as described previously (1Rimm D.L. Kebriaei P. Morrow J.S. Biochem. Biophys.Res. Comm. 1994; 203: 1691-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 3Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Constructs were prepared using the pGEX (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) prokaryotic expression vectors subcloned by either polymerase chain reaction or restriction enzyme digestion of the full-length clone and were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) 2The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; R S, Stokes radius; fusion proteins inEscherichia coli. For some constructs, the pGEX-KT vector was also utilized to facilitate thrombin cleavage of the recombinant fusion protein from GST (10Hakes D.J. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Bacterial cultures were grown for 3 h and then induced for 3 h with isopropyl-ॆ-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.1 mm) before harvesting. Lysis was achieved by four repetitions of a 30-s sonication on ice in TBSE (20 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) with 1 mm DTT and 1 mm each of the protease inhibitors PefablocSC (Centrachem), chymostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin (all from Sigma). The 15,000 × g supernatant of the lysate was affinity purified on glutathione-agarose (Sigma) at 4 °C and washed extensively with TBSE containing 0.1 mm DTT. GST-containing peptides were eluted by the addition of 5 mm glutathione, pH = 8.0 (Sigma) in TBSE containing PefablocSC and 1 mm DTT. Alternatively, GST was cleaved from the peptides while the peptides were bound to the GST affinity column by the addition of 10 cleavage units/ml of thrombin (Sigma) in 20 mm Tris, 120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm KCl at 20 °C for 10 min. After digestion, the cleaved peptide was eluted, and 20 mm DTT was added to the eluates, which were stored on ice for at least 1 h. Eluted recombinant proteins were then dialyzed into Tris-buffered binding buffer (TBBB, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT) prior to further use. To determine the Stokes' radius, thrombin-cleaved fusion proteins (500–1500 ॖg) were fractionated at 20 °C in TBBB using a 16/60 HiPrep®Sephacryl S-300 high resolution column (Pharmacia). The column was calibrated using thyroglobulin, apoferritin, catalase, aldolase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and BSA (all from Sigma) as standards. Collected constant volume fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein in each fraction quantified by densitometry after Coomassie Blue staining using a UMAX Vista-S6E gel scanner and the ScanAnalysisTM(Biosoft) software package on an Apple Macintosh®Computer. To determine the sedimentation velocity of the thrombin-cleaved fusion peptides, 5–207 sucrose gradients in 20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT were made using a 12-ml gradient maker (Hoefer) and layered into tubes using a HBI Auto-Densi-Flow® IIc gradient layering and harvesting device. The protein samples (250–750 ॖg) were layered on top of the sucrose gradients, and the tubes were spun at 200,000 × g for 11–12 h at 20 °C. Fractions (0.26 ml) were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE as above. The solution molecular weights were estimated by using sizing chromatography to determine the Stokes radius (R S) followed by velocity sedimentation to determine S values. Molecular weight was calculated from the Svedberg equation by calculating a diffusion coefficient from the Stokes-Einstein equation, and then using the measured Stokes radius to calculate the molecular weight from the measured sedimentation velocity. The value of (1 − νρ) was determined empirically from the average of 3 standards of known size. Specifically, D=RTN6πηRS(Stokes­Einstein equation)Equation 1 and Mr=RTSD(1−νρ)(Svedberg equation)Equation 2 where D is the diffusion coefficient; R, the universal gas constant; T, the temperature in degrees Kelvin; N, Avogadro's number; η, the viscosity of the solution; S, the sedimentation coefficient in Svedbergs; ν, the partial specific volume of the protein (taken as 0.74 initially, ultimately determined empirically from standards); and ρ, the density of the buffer (taken as unity). GST-containing fusion peptides (2 ॖm), thrombin-cleaved fusion peptides (10 ॖm), and 1.57 BSA were combined at 20 °C for 2–3 h in TBBB containing 1 mm MgCl2 and 0.17 Triton X-100. The mixture was cooled briefly on ice, and then 50 ॖl of a 507 slurry of glutathione-agarose in the same buffer was added to 200 ॖl of the reaction mixture. After 20 min of incubation, the pellets were washed 4 times in 500 ॖl of the same buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Bound protein was quantified by densitometry as described above. The interaction of α-catenin and ॆ-catenin recombinant proteins was also assayed using surface plasmon resonance using a Pharmacia BIACore® 2000 instrument (11Malmqvist M. Nature. 1993; 361: 186-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant GST free ॆ-catenin was diluted to 10 ॖm in 10 mm MES buffer (pH 5.0) and coupled to the surface of a CM5 sensor chip (Pharmacia Biosensor) using amine-coupling chemistry. Briefly, the dextran-coated surface of the sensor chip was activated for protein coupling with a 1:1 dilution of 40 ॖl ofN-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N-(3-diethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at 5 ॖl/min, followed by the addition of recombinant ॆ-catenin (using a range of concentrations). The coupling reaction was terminated by deactivation of the activated groups on the dextran surface by 10 ॖl of 1 m ethanolamine. These conditions yielded sensor surfaces containing ≈200–1,000 resonance units. Changes in resonance were assessed after the addition of increasing amounts of recombinant α-catenin, following established instrumental procedures (Pharmacia Biosensor). Surfaces were regenerated after ligand binding by brief treatment with 50 mm NaOH until the resonance units detected returned to baseline levels. The surfaces so conjugated were stable for at least 100 binding-regeneration cycles. Rate constants were calculated using the BIAEvaluation 2.1 software package (Pharmacia Biosensor). Recombinant α- and ॆ-catenin, cleaved from GST, were dialyzed into 5 mmTris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, mixed 1:1 with glycerol to a final concentration of ≈0.2–0.6 mg/ml, and immediately sprayed onto freshly cleaved mica and loaded into a Balzers BAF 400 rotary shadowing apparatus. These samples were then rotary shadowed with platinum at an angle of 6 degrees in a vacuum, followed by carbon shadowing at 80 degrees. The resultant Pt-C replicas were floated onto standard electron microscopy grids, examined, and photographed using a Zeiss EM10A. Digitized negatives were used to construct figure composites using Adobe Photoshop 3.0 operating on an Apple Macintosh 7100 computer. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents were of reagent grade or better and were obtained from Sigma. All SDS-PAGE analyses were Coomassie Blue stained. Protein analysis was carried out by the Bradford assay (12Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using BSA as a protein standard. Recombinant polypeptides were prepared that collectively represented full-length human α- and ॆ-catenin as well as a series of complementary peptides representing various sequences within α-catenin (Fig.1). These polypeptides were used either as fusion peptides with GST, or more often as GST-free peptides after cleavage with thrombin. To determine the solution state of α- and ॆ-catenin, full-length GST-free recombinant proteins were evaluated by gel filtration and sedimentation velocity. A representative gel filtration profile is shown (Fig. 2). Generally, standards were run separately from test samples, although the inclusion of standards simultaneously with the test samples did not affect outcome. In these experiments, it was apparent that α-catenin in TBBB buffer at 20 °C migrated more rapidly than did ॆ-catenin. To determine the R S of each species (Fig.3), their elution positions were compared with a standard curve established using thyroglobulin (8.6 nm), catalase (5.2 nm), alcohol dehydrogenase (4.5 nm), and BSA (3.6 nm). Each determination was repeated between 2 and 5 times, and a separate standard curve was constructed for each catenin preparation. TheR S values derived from these determinations are summarized in Table I.Figure 2Sizing chromatography of α1(E)- and ॆ-catenin. Each trace indicates the amount of α-catenin (⋄), ॆ-catenin (□), α-catenin in the mixed α/ॆ-catenin sample (▵) or ॆ-catenin in the mixed α/ॆ-catenin sample (○) as determined by scanning the gels shown below the graph. Theupper gel is α-catenin; the middle gel is ॆ-catenin; and the lower gel is the mixture with theupper band indicating α-catenin, and the lower band indicating ॆ-catenin.

Based on an average of four determinations, the derived Stokes radius of α-catenin was 7.4 ± 0.38 nm; ॆ-catenin, 4.6 ± 0.53 nm; and the α-catenin·ॆ-catenin complex, 6.8 ± 0.26 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table ISummary of biophysical calculationsProteinStokes radiusnSedimentation velocitynCalculated molecular weightProposed solution stateTheoretical molecular weightnmSα-Catenin7.40 ± 0.3851-aAverage based on number of determinations (n) ±1 S.D.47.04 ± 0.4721-aAverage based on number of determinations (n) ±1 S.D.4213,000Homodimer200,560ॆ-Catenin4.62 ± 0.5311-aAverage based on number of determinations (n) ±1 S.D.43.86 ± 0.2661-aAverage based on number of determinations (n) ±1 S.D.573,000Monomer85,505α-Catenin · ॆ-catenin6.82 ± 0.2551-aAverage based on number of determinations (n) ±1 S.D.26.38 ± 0.3671-aAverage based on number of determinations (n) ±1 S.D.5178,000Heterodimer185,7851-a Average based on number of determinations (n) ±1 S.D. Open table in a new tab Similar methods were used for determination of the sedimentation values (Figs. 4 and5). Standard sedimentation curves were constructed, using as standards thyroglobulin (19.5 S), catalase (11.3 S), alcohol dehydrogenase (7.6 S), BSA (4.3 S), and cytochromec (1.8 S). A separate standard curve was constructed for each catenin preparation. The Svedberg coefficients derived from these determinations are summarized in Table I. Solution molecular weights were then estimated from these values as outlined under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 These values are summarized in Table I. Comparison of the calculated solution molecular weights with the theoretical molecular weights based on their peptide sequences indicates that in solution, α-catenin exists predominately as a homodimer; ॆ-catenin is monomeric; and that the major species in a mixture of α- and ॆ-catenin is a heterodimeric complex composed of one α-catenin and one ॆ-catenin, although other species are suggested by minor peaks in the sedimenation profile.Figure 5Estimation of the sedimentation coefficient of the catenins. The relationship of how each catenin sedimented in the sucrose gradient with respect to markers of known S value is shown. Markers were: thyroglobulin (19.5 S); catalase (11.3 S); alcohol dehydrogenase (7.6 S); BSA (4.3 S); and cytochrome c (1.8 S). The best fit derived from five standards is shown. The calculated sedimentation value for each catenin is shown for a representative experiment. Based on five determinations, the Svedberg coefficient for α-catenin was 7.0 ± 0.47 S; ॆ-catenin, 3.9 ± 0.27 S; and the α-catenin·ॆ-catenin complex, 6.4 ± 0.37 S. All determinations were made with the nonfusion recombinant proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sedimentation and gel filtration studies suggested that ॆ-catenin binding competed with the homodimerization of α-catenin. To better understand this process, we used a series of recombinant polypeptides (Fig. 1) to define the minimal sites within α-catenin for both ॆ-catenin binding and homodimerization. Various GST containing fusion polypeptides were incubated with full-length α-catenin; binding was assessed by the ability of glutathione-agarose to capture the full-length (GST-free) α-catenin. Fig.6 shows that full-length α-catenin (migrating at about 100 kDa) co-sediments with fusion peptides encompassing the NH2-terminal 228 residues of α-catenin, but not with peptides representing any combination of residues distal to residue 229. These results suggest that dimerization of α-catenin is mediated by sequences proximal to residue 228. Consonant with this observation is the finding that α2(E)-catenin, which arises by 3′-alternative mRNA splicing of the α(E)-catenin gene (1Rimm D.L. Kebriaei P. Morrow J.S. Biochem. Biophys.Res. Comm. 1994; 203: 1691-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), also appears to dimerize by a mechanism similar to that utilized by α1(E)-catenin (Fig. 6, lane L). Controls are shown to prove the interaction is specific including lane A, which shows no nonfusion α-catenin sediments with glutathione-agarose beads in the absence of an interaction with a GST-fusion protein. Similar techniques were used to identify the region of interaction with ॆ-catenin (Fig. 7). No binding was seen with recombinants representing sequences distal to residue 229. The smallest sequence that bound ॆ-catenin spanned amino acids 54–157. Interestingly, these residues, while sufficient to mediate the binding to ॆ-catenin, were insufficient to mediate binding to α-catenin (i.e. homodimerization). Thus, it appears that whereas both homodimerization and ॆ-catenin binding involve similar regions of α-catenin, the two activities are distinct. Given the ability of ॆ-catenin to compete effectively for the self-association of α-catenin, as well as the importance of this interaction for the formation of the membrane adhesion complex, the quantitative properties of this interaction were of considerable interest. The binding kinetics of full-length α-catenin interacting with immobilized ॆ-catenin were thus measured by surface plasmon resonance, using a Pharmacia BIAcoreTM Biosensor 2000 instrument. The binding of six concentrations of α-catenin at pH 7.5 in TBBB was assessed using sensor surfaces containing between 500 and 2000 resonance units of bound ॆ-catenin (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡). Representative sensorgrams are presented in Fig. 8. Good fits to the sensorgrams were obtained using a simple bimolecular ligand binding model, as determined by the absence of systematic residuals and a linear K S versus C plot (Fig. 8,inset). From these analyses, a K d of 100 nm was determined. Similar analyses were also attempted to determine the strength of the homodimerization site in α-catenin. These studies did not yield reliable binding isotherms. We do not know whether this is a consequence of a weaker interaction mediating homodimerization, an artifact of the immobilization reaction, or an effect arising from competition between solution phase homodimerizationversus binding to immobilized α-catenin. The ultrastructure of platinum/carbon replicas generated by rotary shadowing of purified recombinant α- and ॆ-catenin was also evaluated (Fig.9). In these studies, α-catenin was found to be a 35.8 ± 4.7 nm elongated molecule with an enlarged knob at one end. This structure is reminiscent of the structure of vinculin, a protein that shares sequence (13Herrenknecht K. Ozawa M. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Lenter M. Kemler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9156-9160Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 14Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Tsukita S. Cell. 1991; 65: 849-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and functional homology with α-catenin (15Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Nature. 1995; 373: 261-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We believe the majority of the α-catenin prepared for imaging is monomeric, but some larger complexes appear (Fig. 9 A, lower right box) that may represent dimers. These forms are less frequent. Representative images of ॆ-catenin are shown in Fig. 9 B. These molecules appear to be simple 13.7 ± 1.5 nm globular monomers with a tiny but consistent dot that is sometimes suggestive of a tail-like structure. The morphology of the α-catenin·ॆ-catenin heterodimer is shown in Fig. 9 C. The width of these complexes is 15.0 ± 1.8 nm, comparable to the diameter of the ॆ-catenin molecule. The length is 21.0 ± 2.4 nm, suggesting some conformational change accompanying heterodimerization. The schematic below each part of the figure shows our conception of the general shape of each molecule and how they might fit together. The results reported here establish that: 1) α-catenin exists in a dynamic monomeric-dimeric equilibrium with the dimeric state being favored when the molecule is in pure solution at micromolar concentrations; 2) the dimerization site is confined to the amino-terminal 228 residues; 3) ॆ-catenin binds α-catenin with aK d of 100 nm affinity at a site between residues 54–157 of α-catenin; 4) the binding of ॆ-catenin destabilizes the α-catenin dimer with heterodimers of α/ॆ-catenin preferred over α-catenin homodimers; 5) purified ॆ-catenin exists as a monomeric species in free solution; and 6) α-catenin is a highly asymmetric molecule with a morphology similar to that for vinculin, whereas ॆ-catenin is globular. Collectively, these studies substantially extend our understanding of the biochemistry of this class of molecules and lend quantitative rigor to earlier experiments assessing α/ॆ-catenin interactions. The order of protein interactions has been difficult to ascertain. The two-hybrid assay (9Jou T.S. Stewart D.B. Stappert J. Nelson W.J. Marrs J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5067-5071Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), differential extraction assay (8Ozawa M. Kemler R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 989-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), and gel overlay assays (16Aberle H. Butz S. Stappert J. Weissig H. Kemler R. Hoschuetzky H. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3655-3663Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have sought to address this question. Some interactions, including the archetypal cadherin interaction, include ॆ-catenin, α-catenin, and a cadherin molecule in the complex, while others, including fascin (17Tao Y.S. Edwards R.A. Tubb B. Wang S. Bryan J. McCrea P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1271-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) or the transcription factor LEF (18Behrens J. Vonkries J.P. Kuhl M. Bruhn L. Wedlich D. Grosschedl R. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 382: 638-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (2605) Google Scholar), have suggested that ॆ-catenin binds its substrate in the absence of α-catenin. This may be due to competition for the same site, or possibly other reasons having to do with the role of ॆ-catenin as a signal transduction molecule. Another example of the independent function of α-catenin and ॆ-catenin is the recent work on the ॆ-catenin·APC complex that suggests that the microtubule binding functions of APC may provide a connection of that complex to the cytoskeleton (19Nathke I.S. Adams C.L. Polakis P. Sellin J.H. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 165-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). This work finds no association of the α-catenin/actin interaction in this complex and provides no explanation or localization for the initially identified coprecipitating α-catenin molecule (20Su L.-K. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1993; 262: 1734-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). The fact that ॆ-catenin can be identified in conditions where it does not interact with α-catenin suggests the possibility of the converse as well. It is possible that there are conditions in which α-catenin is present as a dimer and not bound to ॆ-catenin. Determination of the minimal binding site by the use of progressively smaller recombinants is a valuable technique but has certain inherent limitations. In this study, the NH2-terminal region of α-catenin defines a 228 residue domain that is difficult to divide with respect to the dimerization site. Both the peptide containing amino acids 1–96 and that containing amino acids 97–226 co-sediment full-length α-catenin with apparent lower affinity, suggesting a complex interaction site. This might be explained by a tertiary structure in this domain where the protein folds back on itself to produce a dimerization site with components from both amino acids 1–96 and 97–226. The ॆ-catenin binding site appears to also illustrate division of a binding site as less binding is seen to peptides 1–96 and 97–226 than is seen to a peptide encompassing residues 54–157. We interpret this result as suggesting that the ॆ-catenin binding site centered around residue 96 and that flanking sequences, each retain a portion of the binding site and are still capable of binding ॆ-catenin albeit with lower affinity. It is also clear that while the sites of interaction for homodimerization and ॆ-catenin binding nearly overlap, they are nevertheless distinct. While ॆ-catenin binding can be mapped to a relatively small region immediately surrounding amino acid 96, the α-catenin homodimerization site is more diffuse. Both the dimerization and ॆ-catenin binding sites do not overlap with other α-catenin interaction sites, including the C-terminal actin binding domain (3Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8813-8817Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) and a central region of the molecule where an interaction with α-actinin has been proposed (21Nieset J.E. Redfield A.R. Jin F. Knudsen K.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Note that while this work was under review, two studies appeared showing that the binding site for ॆ-catenin on α-catenin was in the same region discussed above (21Nieset J.E. Redfield A.R. Jin F. Knudsen K.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Obama H. Ozawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11017-11020Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although the predominant species seen in mixes of α-catenin and ॆ-catenin has a calculated molecular mass around 180 kDa, which suggests a heterodimer, other species may exist. Both the elution profile of the gel filtration column and the sucrose gradient fractionation show shoulders on the primary peaks. A representative example of this is seen in the sucrose gradient fractionation in Fig.4. A clear second peak is seen in the α-catenin profile derived from quantification of the mixed sample. Although less pronounced, a shoulder can also be seen at the same fraction in the quantification of ॆ-catenin. When fit to the curve, this suggests a possible second species with a sedimentation value of around 8.5 S. It is tempting to calculate a solution molecular weight for this species, however, the corresponding Stokes radius is difficult to ascertain. Although Fig. 2shows an example of a shoulder peak in the quantification of α-catenin as part of the analysis of the mixed sample, that peak corresponds with the major peak for α-catenin in solution by itself. Thus it is as likely that this peak represents α-catenin dimer as another mixed species. The exact nature of higher order complexes is difficult to ascertain. They may be dependent on assay conditions like ionic strength and temperature. Although not shown, a smaller population of larger forms are seen by electron microscopy, which is consistent with the chromatographic data suggesting that higher order structures may be present. Overall, these findings suggest that in cells, dimers and other higher order structures may exist. A central question is the implications of these findings for the dynamics of adhesion complex assembly in vivo. While not directly addressed in these studies, several considerations emerge. Clearly, a dynamic equilibrium exists between α-catenin homodimerization and α/ॆ-catenin heterodimers. In addition, the affinity of ॆ-catenin for α-catenin is high. These findings suggest that the free levels of unassociated α-catenin in a cell will be low, at least in the absence of other factors that might regulate this interaction. This prediction has generally been supported by available evidence, although it must be considered that the published literature has emphasized the co-localization of α- and ॆ-catenin rather than treating them as distinct populations. In addition, methods that could potentially distinguish free α-catenin pools, such as sizing chromatography and sucrose gradient sedimentation of whole cell extracts (22Hinck L. Nathke I.S. Papkoff J. Nelson W.J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1327-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 23Papkoff J. Rubinfeld B. Schryver B. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2128-2134Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), may be complicated by the similar migration profiles of α-catenin dimers and α-catenin·ॆ-catenin complexes (Figs. 2and 4). Recent studies suggest that functional adhesion requires clustering of the cadherins (25Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Pruschy M. Gumbiner B.M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 308-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). A population of α-catenin homodimers may contribute to the dynamics of adhesion complex assembly and regulation by facilitating this clustering by dimerization or some combination of multimerization and interactions with α-actinin (21Nieset J.E. Redfield A.R. Jin F. Knudsen K.A. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1013-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), actin (3Rimm D.L. Koslov E.R. Kebriaei P. Cianci C.D. Morrow J.S. Proc.

Like ॆ-catenin, α-catenin is emerging as a complex multifunctional molecule that may participate in a range of binding interactions. We thank Dr. Thomas D. Pollard for facilitating the rotary shadowing experiments and for helpful comments."

The nature of the metal ion-dependent association between the heavy and light chains was investigated using atomic absorption spectroscopy, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR), and site-directed mutagenesis and expression of the FVIII cDNA. Whereas copper ion was not detected in intact recombinant FVIII, EDTA dissociation of the chains yielded an EPR signal consistent with 1 mol of Cu(I)/mol of active protein, supporting the hypothesis that a single molecule of reduced copper ion is buried within intact FVIII and is released and oxidized upon treatment with EDTA. Cu(I), and not Cu(II), was able to reconstitute FVIII activity from dissociated chains, demonstrating a requirement for Cu(I) in FVIII function. Three potential copper ion binding sites exist within FVIII: one type-2 site and two type-1 sites. The importance of these potential copper ion ligands was tested by studying the effect of site-directed mutants. Of the two histidines that compose the type-2 binding site, the His-1957 → Ala mutant displayed secretion, light and heavy chain assembly, and activity similar to wild-type FVIII, while mutant His-99 → Ala was partially defective for secretion and had low levels of heavy and light chain association and activity. In contrast, FVIII having the mutation Cys-310 → Ser within the type-1 copper binding site in the A1 domain was inactive and partially defective for secretion from the cell, and the heavy and light chains of the secreted protein were not associated. Mutant Cys-2000 → Ser within the A3 domain displayed secretion, assembly, and activity similar to that for wild-type FVIII. These results support the hypothesis that Cu(I) is buried within the type-1 copper binding site within the A1 domain and is required for FVIII chain association and activity.

Cu(I), and not Cu(II), was able to reconstitute FVIII activity from dissociated chains, demonstrating a requirement for Cu(I) in FVIII function. Three potential copper ion binding sites exist within FVIII: one type-2 site and two type-1 sites. The importance of these potential copper ion ligands was tested by studying the effect of site-directed mutants. Of the two histidines that compose the type-2 binding site, the His-1957 → Ala mutant displayed secretion, light and heavy chain assembly, and activity similar to wild-type FVIII, while mutant His-99 → Ala was partially defective for secretion and had low levels of heavy and light chain association and activity. In contrast, FVIII having the mutation Cys-310 → Ser within the type-1 copper binding site in the A1 domain was inactive and partially defective for secretion from the cell, and the heavy and light chains of the secreted protein were not associated. Mutant Cys-2000 → Ser within the A3 domain displayed secretion, assembly, and activity similar to that for wild-type FVIII. These results support the hypothesis that Cu(I) is buried within the type-1 copper binding site within the A1 domain and is required for FVIII chain association and activity. Factor VIII (FVIII) 1The abbreviations used are: FVIII, factor VIII; FV, factor V; vWF, von Willebrand factor; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance; WT, wild-type; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ALLN, N-α-Leu-Leu-norleucinal; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. is the X-chromosome-linked gene product that is deficient or defective in the bleeding disorder hemophilia A. FVIII functions in the blood-clotting cascade as the cofactor for factor IXa proteolytic activation of factor X. FVIII has a domain organization of A1-A2-B-A3-C1-C2 and is synthesized as a single chain polypeptide of 2351 amino acids, from which a 19-amino acid signal peptide is cleaved upon translocation into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (1Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P.O. Roblat F. Oppermann H. Keck R. Wood W.I. Harkins R.W. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R.M. Capon D.J.

Upon secretion from the cell, FVIII is further processed by cleavage after residue 1648 to yield a heterodimer consisting of a 220-kDa amino-terminal-derived heavy chain (domains A1-A2-B) associated in a metal ion-dependent manner with a carboxyl-terminal-derived light chain (domains A3-C1-C2) (3Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The FVIII heterodimer circulates in plasma in a complex with von Willebrand factor (vWF) in an inactive form that requires proteolytic cleavage by thrombin or factor Xa for release from vWF and generation of coagulant activity. Cleavage within the heavy chain after Arg-740 generates a 90-kDa fragment that is further cleaved after Arg-372 to yield fragments of 50 and 43 kDa (4Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2429-2433Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 5Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). The 80-kDa light chain is cleaved after Arg-1689 to generate a 73-kDa polypeptide. Activated FVIII (FVIIIa) is a heterotrimer of A1, A2, and A3/C1/C2 subunits. The A1 and A3/C1/C2 subunits interact through a stable metal ion-dependent association between the A1 and A3 domains, while the A2 domain is associated with the A1 domain through a weak electrostatic interaction (6Lollar P. Parker G.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The triplicated A domains of FVIII exhibit 35–407 amino acid identity to each other and to the triplicated A domains in coagulation factor V (FV) and in the copper-binding protein ceruloplasmin (7Kane W.H. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6800-6804Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 8Jenny R.J. Pittman D.D. Toole J.J. Kriz R.W. Aldape R.A. Hewick R.M. Kaufman R.J. Mann K.G.

Each of the A domains exhibits conserved disulfide bridges and can be subdivided into two subdomains (subdomains d1–d6 for the three A domains in FVIII, FV, and ceruloplasmin). Each d subdomain resembles the ॆ-barrel folded structure of the ancient copper ion-binding protein cupredoxin (10Adman E.T. Adv. Protein Chem. 1991; 42: 145-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The blue copper-containing proteins and proteins related to them form a heterogeneous group that extend from the small blue proteins in bacteria and plants, to the blue oxidases in plants and mitochondria, and to the coagulation factors V and VIII in vertebrate plasma (11Ryden L.G. Hunt L.T. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 41-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). These proteins contain copper ions of three types that are defined by the amino acid ligands that constitute the binding site. The blue copper-containing proteins can bind from 1 to 9 copper atoms, where the blue color is attributed to the presence of a type-1 copper binding site with characteristic spectral and redox properties (12Malkin R. Malmstrom B.G. Adv. Enzymol. 1970; 33: 177-243PubMed Google Scholar). The blue oxidases and related proteins, which include the plant proteins laccase, ascorbate oxidase, and the plasma protein ceruloplasmin, contain an intensely blue type-1 Cu(II) ion with absorption in the visible region, a trinuclear cluster consisting of a pair of magnetically coupled type-3 copper ions characterized by a strong absorption in the near-ultraviolet region and the absence of an EPR signal, and a magnetically isolated type-2 Cu(II) ion having an undetectable absorption. The type-1 and type-2 Cu(II) ions have unique EPR spectra that disappear and absorption properties that change upon reduction of the copper ion to Cu(I) (13Malmstrom B.G. Annu. Rev. Biochemistry. 1982; 51: 21-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Laccase and ascorbate oxidase perform oxidation reactions by transferring four electrons from a reducing substrate to a molecule of oxygen that is subsequently reduced to water. Sequence alignments and three-dimensional structures support the hypotheses that the small blue proteins and the blue oxidases are homologous (14Ryden L. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6767-6771Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and evolved from a common origin through gene duplication and divergence (11Ryden L.G. Hunt L.T. J. Mol. Evol. 1993; 36: 41-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 15Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The evolutionary and structural conservation of the A domains between the coagulation factors and the blue oxidases suggests a role for copper ion binding in the coagulation factors. Indeed, approximately 1 mol of copper ion/mol of protein was detected directly in FVIII by atomic absorption spectroscopy (16Bihoreau N. Pin S. Kersabiec A.M. Vidot F. Fontaine-Aupart M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and in FV by atomic absorption and atomic emission spectroscopy (17Mann K.G. Lawler C.M. Vehar G.A. Church W.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12949-12951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At present, there is no information regarding the oxidation state or the ligands that coordinate copper ion in FVIII or FV. Based on the homologies to ancient copper-binding proteins and the known structures for the ancient copper-binding proteins, it is hypothesized that copper ion may be important for the metal ion-dependent interaction between the A1 and A3 domains of FVIII. The nature of the metal ion-dependent bridge between the FVIII heavy and light chains was investigated previously using different strategies. Incubation of the plasma-derived FVIII with a chelating agent, such as EDTA, dissociated the heavy and light chains and destroyed coagulant activity (18Nordfang O. Eur. J. Haematol. 1989; 43: 1-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reconstitution of the FVIII heavy and light chain subunits with different divalent cations showed specific ion requirements and ionic strength dependence. Under thesein vitro conditions, Mn(II) was the most effective cation in regenerating FVIII activity, yielding 307 reconstitution, whereas Ca(II) yielded 187 reconstitution. In contrast, copper ion, in the form of cupric solution, did not promote reconstitution (19Nordfang O. Ezban M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1115-1118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Fay P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Atomic absorption spectrometry analysis of FVIII heavy and light chain heterodimers and thrombin-activated FVIII complexes detected copper ion only when the chains were associated (16Bihoreau N. Pin S. Kersabiec A.M. Vidot F. Fontaine-Aupart M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In contrast, neither magnesium or manganese were detected. At present it is unknown what amino acids within FVIII are responsible for coordinating the copper ion. The predicted amino acid sequence of FVIII contains two consensus type-1 copper ion binding sites, each defined by the canonical ligands His-Cys-His-Met that are located in the A1 and A3 domains, respectively (15Messerschmidt A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). However, to date, no direct experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that these potential copper binding sites are occupied by copper ion. An initial structural prediction of the arrangement of the FVIII A domains was made based on the homology with the copper ion-binding protein nitrite reductase (21Pan Y. DeFay T. Gitschier J. Cohen F.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). More recently, this model was refined based on the 3-Å structure of ceruloplasmin (22Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card K.M. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Bioinorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Google Scholar, 23Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these models, a type-2 copper ion binding site composed of histidine residues at positions 99 and 1957 is proposed to bridge the A1 and A3 domains of FVIII. To elucidate the nature of the copper ion binding site in FVIII, we performed chemical analysis, functional assays, and site-directed mutagenesis to identify the copper ion content and its ligands within FVIII. Recombinant FVIII, anti-heavy chain factor VIII monoclonal antibody (F-8), and F-8 conjugated to CL-4B Sepharose were obtained from Genetics Institute Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Centriplus columns were purchased from Amicon Inc. (Beverly, MA). Light chain factor VIII monoclonal antibodies ESH-4 and ESH-8 were purchased from American Diagnostica Inc. (Greenwich, CT).

(Overland Park, KS). Activated partial thromboplastin reagent and CaCl2 were purchased from General Diagnostics Organ Technique Corp. (Durham, NC). Human α-thrombin was from Hemtological Technology Inc. (Burlington VT). Soybean trypsin inhibitor, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and aprotinin were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Chelex-100 resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. Atomic absorption measurements were made on a Perkin Elmer 3300. Recombinant FVIII protein (350 ॖl) was diluted 1/1 in 17 HNO3 (by volume), injected in the pyrolitic graphite tube heated by joule effect with the following program: 120 K for 50 s, 1000 K for 30 s, and 2300 K for 5 s. The calibration curve was obtained by dilution of the standard copper solution in 0.57 HNO3. Each value was the average of two measurements. EPR measurements were made using a Varian Century line X-band (9 GHz) EPR spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic Dewar system. The conditions for the detection of the cupric ions were as follows: microwave power, 10 milliwatts; microwave frequency, 9.17 GHz; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; amplitude, 0.1 millitesla; temperature, 130K. For each spectrum, the analog output was recorded digitally on the computer via a data acquisition board made by ComputerBoard Inc. (Mansfield, MA). Human recombinant FVIII in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 0.4 mol/liter NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2, and 0.17 Tween 80 was incubated at 37 °C with human α-thrombin. At short intervals, aliquots were removed and assayed for FVIII clotting activity by the one-stage clotting assay using FVIII-deficient plasma. Highly purified recombinant FVIII was treated with 50 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, for 16 h at room temperature. The rate of dissociation was monitored by loss of activity measured by the one-stage clotting assay. The reaction was dialyzed against a metal ion-free buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 57 glycerol. Metal-free water, filtered through a Chelex-100 resin, was used throughout the experiment. The reconstitution of FVIII activity was performed by adding solutions of cupric chloride or cuprous chloride to the dissociated FVIII protein (35 ॖg/ml) as indicated. Reactions were performed at room temperature, and aliquots were removed at the indicated times for measure of activity using the one-stage clotting assay. The FVIII expression vector pMT2-VIII MluI-1648 has been described previously (24Pittman D.D. Marquette K.A. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1994; 84: 4214-4225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prior studies demonstrated that the introduction of the MluI restriction site (yielding a Thr-Arg at amino acid residues 1647–1648) did not alter the synthesis, secretion, or functional activity of the molecule. Site-directed oligonucleotide-mediated mutagenesis was performed by polymerase chain reaction procedures (25Erlich H.A. PCR Technology: Principles and Applications for DNA Amplification. Stockton Press, New York1989Crossref Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Codon 99 was mutated from CAT to GCT predicting an amino acid change from histidine to alanine (His-99 → Ala), codon 310 was mutated from TGT to AGT predicting an amino acid change from cysteine to serine (Cys-310 → Ser), codon 1957 was mutated from CAT to GCT predicting an amino acid change from histidine to alanine (His-1957 → Ala), and codon 2000 was mutated from TGC to TCC predicting an amino acid change from cysteine to serine (Cys-2000 → Ser). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing over the mutagenized region and extensive mapping with restriction endonuclease enzymes. Plasmid DNA was transfected into COS-1 monkey cells by the diethylaminoethyl (DEAE)-dextran procedure (26Dorner A.J. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 577-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was harvested 60 h after transfection in the presence of 107 heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum for FVIII assay. Primary translation products were analyzed by pulse-labeling cells for 30 min with [35S]methionine (250 ॖCi/ml in methionine-free medium) and preparing cell extracts in a Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (27Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 236-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Protein secretion was monitored by metabolic pulse-labeling cells for 30 min with [35S]methionine (250 ॖCi/ml) and chasing for the indicated period of time in medium containing an excess of unlabeled methionine as described (28Pittman D.D. Millenson M. Marquette K. Bauer K. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 389-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The FVIII was immunoprecipitated from the cell extract and conditioned medium with an anti-heavy chain factor VIII monoclonal antibody F-8 (27Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 236-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) coupled to CL-4B Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were washed as described (27Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 236-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions using a low bisacrylamide containing 87 polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were visualized by autoradiography after fluography by treatment with EN3HANCE. The band intensities were quantitated by scanning the lanes using an LKB UltroScan XL laser densitometer (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Uppsala, Sweden). Chain association was measured by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. After immunoprecipitation with an anti-heavy chain antibody F-8, the supernatant was subsequently immunoprecipitated with the anti-light chain monoclonal antibody ESH-4 coupled to Affi-Gel. Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above. Factor VIII activity was measured by the coamatic chromogenic assay (Coamate) according to the manufacturer or by the one-stage activated partial thromboplastin time clotting assay using FVIII-deficient plasma. The antigen level was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the monoclonal antibodies ESH-4 and ESH-8 that recognize the FVIII light chain (29Zatloukal K. Cotten M. Berger M. Schmidt W. Wagner E. Birnstiel M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5148-5152Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For highly purified FVIII, the protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Homogeneous recombinant FVIII, purified from Chinese hamster ovary cells was analyzed by atomic absorption to determine the copper ion content and to correlate the amount of copper ion/mol of active protein. The specific activity of the recombinant FVIII was 1250 units/mg, as measured by the one-stage clotting assay and Bradford protein assay. Atomic absorption spectroscopy detected 484 nm copper ion/500 nm active protein, consistent with 1 mol of copper ion/mol of active FVIII protein, and is consistent with a previous report (16Bihoreau N. Pin S. Kersabiec A.M. Vidot F. Fontaine-Aupart M.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). For EPR analysis, FVIII was concentrated through a Centriplus column and the antigen was measured by ELISA using anti-light chain antibodies. The concentrated protein (55 ॖm) was analyzed by EPR to determine the copper ion content. EPR spectroscopy of frozen FVIII solution revealed no EPR detectable copper ion (Fig.1 A). In addition, the presence of other paramagnetic metal ions, including Mn2+, was not detected. Since atomic absorption spectrometry identified 1 mol of copper ion/mol of active FVIII protein and copper ion would be silent by EPR if it were protected within the protein in a reduced form, we tested whether heavy and light chain dissociation by metal ion chelation would release and oxidize protected copper ion. The FVIII heavy and light chains were separated by incubation with EDTA as previously reported (18Nordfang O. Eur. J. Haematol. 1989; 43: 1-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the dissociation was monitored by inactivation of FVIII activity measured in the one-stage clotting assay. After overnight incubation with 60 mm EDTA, the amount of coagulant FVIII activity decreased to less than 17 of the initial activity. EPR spectroscopy of the dissociated FVIII detected a significant copper ion signal corresponding to 17 ॖm, supposedly as an EDTA-chelated complex (Fig. 1 B). EPR analysis of the EDTA solution excluded contamination of copper ion. In addition, an EPR signal for copper ion was not detected in the cavity. These data demonstrate that native recombinant FVIII contains copper ion in a reduced form Cu(I) that is EPR silent. EDTA treatment dissociated the FVIII heavy and light chains, destroyed coagulant activity, and fully oxidized Cu(I) to Cu(II), thus allowing the recovery and detection of copper ion in the oxidized form. We next tested whether thrombin cleavage and activation may release bound copper ion. After incubation with thrombin, we observed a rapid increase in the coagulant activity, followed by a first-order decay in activity that is known to be accompanied by dissociation of the A2 domain subunit (31Lollar P. Parker E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12481-12486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). EPR analysis was performed 3 h after thrombin cleavage, at a time when most of FVIII activity had decayed. The analysis did not detect copper ion (Fig. 1 C). Incubation of the thrombin-treated sample with 50 mm EDTA for 30 min promptly yielded a detectable Cu-EDTA complex (Fig. 1 D). These results demonstrate that thrombin cleavage and activation are not accompanied by oxidation of bound copper ion and that thrombin-activated FVIII still retained Cu(I) in an EDTA-releasable state. The observation that Cu(I) is present in native FVIII provided the rationale to test whether Cu(I) could promote in vitroreconstitution of FVIII from dissociated heavy and light chains. Reconstitution of FVIII activity from EDTA-dissociated subunits was performed using different copper ion containing solutions in the reduced or oxidized forms. Cuprous chloride was most effective in promoting FVIII activity (Fig. 2). Complete reconstitution (where the reconstituted FVIII exhibited the same specific activity as the starting material) occurred with 10 ॖm Cu(I), which represents an approximate ratio of 30–50 mol of Cu(I)/mol of FVIII. Cuprous chloride at 100 ॖminhibited reconstitution of FVIII activity, probably due to nonspecific binding of the metal ion to the subunits. The reconstitution of FVIII activity reached a plateau after 5 h at room temperature and maintained the activity for at least 24 h at room temperature indicating a stable interaction and assembly of the heavy and light chain subunits in the presence of reduced copper ion. By contrast, the reconstitution of FVIII activity from dissociated heavy and light chain subunits in the absence of metal ion (control) gave only background activity. Cupric solutions, at the same molar ratio as the cuprous solutions, were evaluated for their ability to promote reconstitution. A solution of 10 ॖm Cu(II) yielded a 2-fold increase of FVIII activity, while 100 ॖm Cu(II) was ineffective. Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant ligand for copper ion within the mammalian secretory pathway. In vitro reconstitution of the copper-containing proteins ceruloplasmin (33Musci G. Di Marco S. Bellenchi G.C. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1972-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase (34Ciriolo M.R. Desideri A. Paci M. Rotilio G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11030-11034Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), apohemocyanin (35Brouwer M. Brouwer-Hoexum T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4096-4102Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and thioneins (36Freedman J.H. Ciriolo M. Peisach J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5598-5605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) occurs by means of the copper ion associated in a glutathione complex as Cu(I)-GSH. Under our conditions of reconstitution, Cu(I)-GSH was poorly effective in reconstituting FVIII activity (Fig. 2). Because copper ion within FVIII is detectable only after chelation with EDTA, it is not possible to elucidate the coordination properties of copper ion in FVIII by EPR analysis. Therefore, we tested the significance of the potential copper ion ligands within FVIII by site-directed mutagenesis. FVIII contains two consensus type-1 copper ion binding sites that are located in the A1 domain (composed of residues His-265, Cys-310, His-315, and Met-320) and A3 domain (composed of residues His-1954, Cys-2000, His-2005, and Met-2010). Because the Cys residue is an essential component of the type-1 copper ion binding site (37Canters G.W. Gilardi G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), we mutated each of the two Cys residues Cys-310 and Cys-2000 to the conserved residue Ser to determine their requirement in FVIII chain association and activity. Expression vectors containing the wild-type FVIII cDNA or mutants bearing either of the Cys to Ser substitutions were transfected into COS-1 monkey cells. At 60 h post-transfection, FVIII synthesis and secretion were evaluated by [35S]methionine metabolic pulse labeling and chase analysis. Samples of cell extracts and conditioned medium were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with anti-FVIII heavy chain antibody and SDS-PAGE. Analysis of the cell extracts demonstrated that wild-type FVIII and the mutants were synthesized as single chain polypeptides migrating at approximately 280 kDa (Fig.3 A). Quantitation of the band intensities demonstrated similar amounts of radiolabel incorporation into FVIII protein for all the constructs indicating similar translation rates. In addition, analysis of the 2- and 4-h chase time points demonstrated that the wild-type and both mutants disappeared from the cell extract at similar rates, suggesting similar rates of intracellular degradation and/or secretion. The FVIII secreted into the conditioned medium over the 2–4-h chase period was collected and subjected to immunoprecipitation analysis. FVIII chain association was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of the conditioned medium with anti-FVIII heavy chain antibody. The supernatant was subsequently immunoprecipitated with anti-FVIII light chain antibody. Since the anti-heavy chain antibody does not recognize the light chain and the anti-light chain antibody does not recognize the heavy chain, analysis of the amount of co-immunoprecipitation indicates the extent of chain association. After immunoprecipitation with the anti-heavy chain antibody, wild-type FVIII is detected in the conditioned medium as a single chain of 300 kDa, a heavy chain of 220 kDa, and an associated light chain of 80 kDa. FVIII wild-type and mutants appeared in the conditioned medium after the 2-h chase time point, although the amount of single chain and heavy chain detected for the Cys-310 → Ser mutant were slightly less than the respective species for the w"

Here we report that EWS, a nuclear RNA-binding prooncoprotein, contains an IQ domain, is phosphorylated by protein kinase C, and interacts with calmodulin.

Several other RNA-binding proteins, including TLS/FUS and PSF, co-purify with EWS. PKC phosphorylation of these proteins also inhibits their binding to RNAin vitro. These data suggest that PKC may regulate interactions of EWS and other RNA-binding proteins with their RNA targets and that IQ domains may provide a regulatory link between Ca2+ signal transduction pathways and RNA processing.

These data suggest that PKC may regulate interactions of EWS and other RNA-binding proteins with their RNA targets and that IQ domains may provide a regulatory link between Ca2+ signal transduction pathways and RNA processing. Neuromodulin (GAP-43, B-50, F1) and neurogranin (RC3, BICKS) are neurospecific calmodulin (CaM) 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; PKC, protein kinase C; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; Ab, antibody. 1The abbreviations used are: CaM, calmodulin; PKC, protein kinase C; hnRNP, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DTT, dithiothreitol; Ab, antibody.-binding proteins that are phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) (for reviews see Refs. 8Gerendasy D.D.

The interaction between CaM and the IQ domain of neuromodulin or neurogranin has been characterized extensively in vitro (2Baudier J. Deloulme J.C. Van Dorsselaer A. Black D. Matthes H.W. J. Biol.

The affinity of neuromodulin or neurogranin for CaM is higher in the absence than in the presence of Ca2+, and CaM binding is inhibited by PKC phosphorylation within the IQ domain. Furthermore, CaM binding inhibits PKC phosphorylation of neuromodulin and neurogranin at a specific serine in the IQ domain. These observations led to the hypothesis that neuromodulin may bind and concentrate CaM at specific sites in neurons and release CaM in response to PKC phosphorylation or increases in Ca2+ (5Alexander K.A. Cimler B. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Liu Y.C. Storm D.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Recent data from several laboratories have confirmed that neuromodulin and CaM interact in cells. For example, elevation of free Ca2+ or PKC activation in primary hippocampal neuron cultures inhibits CaM/neuromodulin interactionsin vivo (11Gamby C. Waage M.C. Allen R.G. Baizer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26698-26705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Neuromodulin and CaM have also been shown to interact in vivo using the yeast two-hybrid system (12Chao S. Benowitz L.I. Krainc D. Irwin N. Brain Res. 1996; 40: 195-202Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The IQ domain may serve as a general regulatory domain in proteins for CaM binding and PKC phosphorylation. It has been found in other proteins including the Ca2+ vector protein target fromamphioxus (13Takagi T. Cox J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19721-19727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the neurospecific peptide PEP-19 (14Slemmon J.R. Morgan J.I. Fullerton S.M. Danho W. Hilbush B.S. Wengenack T.M. J. Biol.

The IQ domain may also mediate interactions with other Ca2+-binding proteins belonging to the EF-hand family. The repeat IQ motifs of conventional myosins bind myosin light chains (23Xie X. Harrison D.H. Schlichting I. Sweet R.M. Kalabokis V.N. Szent Gyorgyi A.G. Cohen C. Nature. 1994; 368: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and neuromodulin and neurogranin can also interact with the S100b protein (24Sheu F.S. Azmitia E.C. Marshak D.R. Parker P.J. Routtenberg A. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 21: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 25Sheu S.F. Huang F.L. Huang K.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 316: 335-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The conservation of the IQ regulatory sequence in a variety of proteins strongly suggests that the molecular function of these proteins may be regulated by Ca2+ signal transduction pathways through IQ domain(s), although these proteins have very different biochemical functions. Using an antibody against the IQ domain of neurogranin, we discovered a new member of the IQ protein family, P68-RNA helicase, the first nuclear IQ domain protein identified (26Buelt M.K. Glidden B.J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29367-29370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human P68-RNA helicase is an RNA-dependent ATPase that belongs to the family of putative helicases known as the DEAD box proteins (27Schmid S.R. Linder P. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). These proteins are implicated in some aspects of RNA functions including translation initiation, splicing, and ribosome assembly. PKC phosphorylation and CaM binding both inhibit P68-RNA helicase ATPase activity, suggesting that its RNA unwinding activity or binding to RNA may be regulated by Ca2+ signal transduction pathways (26Buelt M.K. Glidden B.J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29367-29370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Other lines of evidence suggest that RNA processing may be controlled by Ca2+ signal pathways. Recently, Bachs and colleagues (28Bosser R. Faura M. Serratosa J. Renau-Piqueras J. Pruschy M. Bachs O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 661-670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) discovered that heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNPs) A2 and C interact with CaM in the presence of Ca2+. Furthermore, hnRNP A1 is phosphorylated in vivo by PKC-ζ (29Municio M.M. Lozano J. Sánchez P. Moscat J. Diaz-Meco M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15884-15891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and PKC phosphorylation of hnRNP A1 regulates its RNA binding activity in vitro (29Municio M.M.

Damuni Z. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11382-11390Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Since CaM is also present in the nucleus (31Bachs O. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10786-10790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and P68-RNA helicase contains an IQ domain, we examined nuclear extracts for other RNA-binding proteins containing IQ domains. We found that the human nuclear RNA-binding prooncoprotein EWS (Ewing sarcoma protein) contains an IQ domain, binds to CaM, and is phosphorylated by PKC. TheEWS gene is implicated in specific chromosomal translocations occurring in peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumors (32Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H.

We also report that EWS co-purifies with another RNA-binding protein and PKC substrate, TLS/FUS (34Crozat A. Aman P. Mandahl N. Ron D.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Interestingly, PKC phosphorylation of EWS, TLS/FUS, and PSF inhibits their RNA binding activity in vitro.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, bovine calf serum, fetal calf serum, and biotinylated calmodulin were from Life Technologies, Inc. PKC was purified from rabbit brains as described by Alexander et al. (5Alexander K.A. Cimler B. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma and used at final concentrations of 5 ॖg/ml, 10 ॖg/ml, 5 ॖg/ml, and 1 mm, respectively. The addition of protease inhibitors in solutions and buffers is indicated as mixture inhibitor. Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells and mouse fibroblast 3T3-L1 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 57 fetal calf serum and 57 bovine calf serum in a humidified 957 air and 57 CO2incubator. All extraction steps were performed at 4 °C. HEK-293 or 3T3-L1 cells (100-mm plates) were washed three times with 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), scraped off, and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 200 ×g. Pelleted cells were then suspended in 5 volumes of hypotonic buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 25 °C, 0.5 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.57 Triton X-100, and mixture inhibitor and were lysed by 10 strokes of a Kontes all glass Dounce homogenizer (type B pestle). The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g to pellet nuclei. The supernatant was again centrifuged 10 min at 1000 × g to eliminate debris and then for 30 min at 100,000 × g to pellet membranes. The supernatant was designated as the cytosolic fraction. The pelleted membranes were solubilized in alkaline buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 10.0, at 25 °C, 0.5 m NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 17 Triton X-100, and mixture inhibitor. The membrane fraction was clarified by 12,000 × g for 20 min. The pelleted nuclei obtained from the low speed spin were washed twice with 5 volumes of wash buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, at 25 °C, 250 mm sucrose, 5 mmMgCl2, and mixture inhibitor and were centrifuged for 10 min at 800 × g. The pelleted nuclei were then resuspended in 1.5 volumes of the above alkaline buffer with a Kontes all glass Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes with type A and type B pestle) and kept on ice for 30 min. The nuclear homogenate was then centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. The pellet was discarded, and the supernatant was designated as the nuclear extract. Nuclei were isolated from HEK-293 cells as described above and incubated in wash buffer containing 250 ॖg/ml RNase A and 250 ॖg/ml DNase I for 1 h at 4 °C. Triton X-100 and NaCl were added to a final concentration of 0.57 and 1.5 m, respectively. The nuclei were then vigorously vortexed and incubated for a further 30 min on ice. RNase and DNase reactions were stopped by the addition of 5 mmEDTA, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × gfor 20 min. The supernatant was designated as the S1 fraction. The pellet was washed extensively in the wash buffer containing 0.57 Triton X-100, and the nuclear matrix proteins were solubilized in the alkaline buffer. This fraction was designated as the nuclear matrix fraction. Nuclear extract from 36 plates (100 mm) of 14-day-old HEK-293 cells was prepared in alkaline buffer as described above. The pH of the nuclear extract (10 ml containing about 50 mg of total protein) was adjusted to 8.0 with 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, at 25 °C (500 ॖl for 10 ml of nuclear extract) and then loaded on a hydroxylapatite/CF11 column (mixture of 1 and 0.5 g, respectively), which was preequilibrated with a potassium buffer containing 40 mmKH2PO4/K2HPO4, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mmDTT. The column (4-ml bed volume) was washed with 10 ml of alkaline extraction buffer adjusted to pH 8.5, and the flow-through fraction containing unbound proteins was collected to a final volume that was 1.4 times the loaded volume. The flow-through fraction was brought to 157 ammonium sulfate, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation, and centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 × g. The pellet, containing approximately 500 ॖg of total protein, was solubilized in urea buffer containing 25 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, 2 m urea, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, and mixture inhibitor and was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Coomassie Blue-stained gels showed that it was possible to obtain two different kinds of ammonium sulfate fractions containing either five or three major proteins, designated as type A or type B fractions (see 舠Results舡). DNA-cellulose affinity chromatography was performed essentially as described by Pinõl-Roma et al. (38Piñol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The type A fraction (50 ॖg) was applied to an ssDNA- or dsDNA-cellulose column (0.5 ml each) in the urea buffer described above. Columns were washed with the same solution (40 bed volumes), and bound proteins were first eluted with the urea buffer containing heparin (1 mg/ml) and then were sequentially eluted with 0.5, 1, and 2 m NaCl. RNA homopolymers were immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads as described in the Pharmacia instructions. The type A fraction (10 ॖg) was incubated with RNA homopolymer-Sepharose beads in urea buffer for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed, drained, and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Phosphorylation assays were carried out as described by Alexander et al. (5Alexander K.A. Cimler B. Meier K.E. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6108-6113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The type A or B fraction (1 ॖl, 40 ॖg/ml) was incubated with purified PKC in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT in the presence or absence of 1.5 mm CaCl2, 60 ॖg/mll-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine, 6 ॖg/ml diolein, and 70 nm bisindolylmaleimide for the indicated times at 30 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 500 ॖm [γ-32P]ATP. The total volume of the reaction was 50 ॖl, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer or urea. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, dried, and autoradiographed. The autoradiograms were scanned with a Scan Jet II CX scanner and analyzed by densitometry using NIH Image software. Peptide mapping was carried out as described by Cleveland et al. (39Cleveland D.W. Fisher S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the type A fraction (five lanes loaded with 40 ॖg) was run on 87 SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The band corresponding to IQ85 was excised from the gel and reelectrophoresed on a 127 SDS-PAGE gel in the presence of trypsin (0.5 ॖg in 0.125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, at 25 °C, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.17 SDS). To increase the efficiency of cleavage by trypsin, the pH of the stacking gel was brought to 7.8, and 1 mm CaCl2 was added. Digested peptides were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Blue. Selected peptide fragments were sequenced with an automated amino acid sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 477A). Proteins were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membrane as described by Towbin et al. (40Towbin J. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44912) Google Scholar). After transfer, the membrane was blocked for 1 h with 37 cold fish gelatin in PBS buffer. After washing in PBS, the blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary antibodies in TPBS (PBS plus 0.057 Tween 20) as indicated. Bound antibody was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody and an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated substrate kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flow-through fractions from a hydroxylapatite column (100 ॖl) were precleared with 20 ॖl of protein A-Sepharose beads (Pierce) for 1 h. The supernatant was incubated with IQ antibody (2 ॖg of IgG) or EWS 677 antibody (10 ॖl) overnight with agitation, and then 20 ॖl of protein A-Sepharose beads was added for 1 h. Beads were pelleted and washed with PBS plus 17 Triton X-100 (5 × 1 ml). Immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by Western blot using EWS and IQ antibodies. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli et al. (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207139) Google Scholar), and proteins were quantified by the Bradford method (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216068) Google Scholar). The BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) was used to determine the concentration of neurogranin and neuromodulin. CaM binding was monitored by biotinylated calmodulin overlay (43Billingsley M.L. Pennypacker K.R. Hoover C.G. Brigati D.J. Kincaid R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7585-7589Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To identify nuclear proteins that contain IQ domains, we performed Western analysis of subcellular fractions from HEK-293 and mouse 3T3-L1 fibroblast cell lines using a polyclonal antibody (IQ Ab) that recognizes the IQ domain of neuromodulin, neurogranin, and P68-RNA helicase (26Buelt M.K. Glidden B.J. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29367-29370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both cell lines, the IQ Ab recognized P68-RNA helicase and a larger protein of 85 kDa (Fig. 1 A). An additional protein with an apparent molecular mass of 100 kDa was detected in the HEK-293 cell nuclear extracts. These three proteins were localized in the nuclear extract (NE) but were not found in cytoplasmic (Ct) or membrane fractions (Mb). To determine if the 85- and 100-kDa nuclear proteins contained IQ domains, the IQ Ab was incubated with an excess of pepP68, a peptide containing the IQ domain of P68-RNA helicase, and the proteins were analyzed by Western blots. PepP68 totally suppressed interactions between the IQ Ab and P68-RNA helicase or the 85-kDa protein. In contrast, the immunoreactivity observed toward P100 was unchanged (Fig.1 B). These data suggested that the 85-kDa protein, but not the 100-kDa protein, may contain an IQ epitope. Consequently, it was designated IQ85. Bachs and Carafoli (31Bachs O. Carafoli E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10786-10790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that CaM is associated with the nuclear matrix fraction that contains nuclear membrane proteins, proteins implicated in DNA transcription and replication, and proteins involved in RNA metabolism (44Mattern K.A. Humbel B.M. Muijsers A.O. de Jong L. van Driel R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Furthermore, P68-RNA helicase may also be associated with the nuclear matrix (45Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the IQ Ab and a P68-RNA helicase monoclonal antibody, PAb204 (46Lane D.P. Hoeffler W.K. Nature. 1980; 288: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), to investigate the subnuclear localization of IQ85 and P68-RNA helicase in HEK-293 cell nuclei. Purified nuclei were treated with DNase I and RNase A, followed by solubilization using 0.57 Triton X-100 and 1.5m NaCl. The solubilized proteins (S1) and the pellet containing the nuclear matrix fraction (Mx) were analyzed for IQ domain proteins. Western blot analysis with PAb204 and IQ Ab showed that IQ85 and P68-RNA helicase are partially associated with matrix, whereas P100 is predominantly in the S1 fraction (Fig. 1 C). To identify IQ85, fractions from purified nuclei of quiescent HEK-293 cells were prepared as described under 舠Experimental Procedures,舡 and IQ85 was partially purified. The first purification step was similar to that used for isolation of P68-RNA helicase (45Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H.

Hydroxylapatite fractions were analyzed on 87 SDS-PAGE by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig.2 A) and immunoblotting with the IQ Ab (Fig. 2 B). Unlike P68-RNA helicase, which absorbed to the column and was concentrated in the eluate (El), IQ85 was not retained on hydroxylapatite and was found exclusively in the flow-through (FT) fraction (Fig. 2 B). Additional purification of IQ85 was achieved by ammonium sulfate (AS) precipitation of the hydroxylapatite FT fraction. IQ85 was one of the major Coomassie Blue-stained proteins in this fraction (Fig.2 A). The ammonium sulfate pellets were insoluble in buffers lacking detergents and could only be resuspended in the presence of 17 SDS or 2 m urea, suggesting that the precipitated proteins were strongly aggregated. We obtained two types of ammonium sulfate fractions, depending upon the number of HEK-293 cell passages (Fig.2 C). The type A fraction was obtained from HEK-293 cells grown less than 10 passages, whereas the type B fraction was obtained when cell passage was greater than 10. The type A fraction contained five major Coomassie Blue-stained proteins designated P98, IQ85, P70, P60, and P48. P98 and P60 were absent from type B preparations. Densitometry analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained gels showed that IQ85 represented about 20 and 407 of total protein in type A and type B fractions, respectively. Since P68-RNA helicase and IQ85 are both found in the nuclear matrix fraction and hnRNP proteins are also major components of this fraction (44Mattern K.A. Humbel B.M. Muijsers A.O. de Jong L. van Driel R. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we considered the possibility that IQ85 may interact with RNA and bind to ssDNA. P68-RNA helicase has a high affinity for ssDNA but not for dsDNA (45Hirling H. Scheffner M. Restle T. Stahl H. Nature. 1989; 339: 562-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), and most hnRNP proteins can be purified using ssDNA columns. hnRNP proteins are eluted from ssDNA resin with heparin or salt at variable concentrations (38Piñol-Roma S. Choi Y.D. Matunis M.J. Dreyfuss G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 215-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To determine if IQ85 and co-purifying proteins bind RNA, we carried out affinity chromatography on ssDNA-cellulose and dsDNA-cellulose in 2 m urea. Proteins were eluted from the ssDNA or dsDNA columns by sequential elution with 1 mg/ml heparin, 0.5 NaCl, and 1 m NaCl (Fig.3). All major proteins from the type A fraction bound to the ssDNA resin (Fig. 3 A) but not to the dsDNA resin (Fig. 3 B). P98, IQ85, P71, and P60 were eluted from the ssDNA resin with heparin, whereas P48 was eluted with 0.5m NaCl. The RNA binding activity of IQ85 and co-purifying proteins in fraction A were investigated using polyribonucleotides attached to Sepharose beads (Fig. 3 C). IQ85, P98, P71, and P60 displayed a similar preference for poly(U)- and poly(G)-Sepharose (Fig. 3 C). IQ85, P98, and P71 showed low binding for poly(A)- or poly(C)-Sepharose beads, whereas P60 interacted weakly with poly(A)- and poly(C)-Sepharose. P48 was only retained on poly(U)-Sepharose beads. These data indicate that IQ85 and co-purifying proteins are RNA-binding proteins. To identify IQ85, the protein was subjected to peptide mapping using a modified Cleveland method (39Cleveland D.W. Fisher S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We sequenced three tryptic fragments from IQ85 (Fig.4 A), which corresponded exactly to sequences (32Delattre O. Zucman J. Plougastel B. Desmaze C. Melot T. Peter M. Kovar H. Joubert I. de Jong P. Rouleau G.A.A. Thomas G. Nature. 1992; 359: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar) found in human EWS. To confirm the sequencing data, IQ85 was immunoprecipitated with an antibody raised against the N-terminal domain of EWS (EWS 677 Ab), and Western analysis was carried out using the IQ Ab. The IQ Ab recognized the protein immunoprecipitated by the EWS antibody (Fig. 4 B). Conversely, IQ85 immunoprecipitated"

The cis-acting regulatory sites of the DBH gene which respond to Arix and cAMP lie adjacent to each other, between bases −180 and −150, in a regulatory element named DB1. Neither Arix nor cyclic AMP analogs alone effectively stimulate transcription from the DBH promoter in non-neuronal cell cultures. However, when Arix is present together with cAMP, transcription is substantially activated. Synergistic transcription from the DBH promoter can also be elicited by cotransfection of Arix with an expression vector encoding the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Nuclear extracts from PC12 cells display a cAMP-induced complex binding to the DB1 element, and antisera to transcription factors CREB, CREM, Fos, and Jun indicate that these proteins, or closely related family members, interact with DB1. A dominant negative construct of CREB inhibits the response of the DBH promoter to protein kinase A.

These extracellular signals are transduced from the cell surface through second messenger cascades to the nucleus, where they influence transcriptional control mechanisms.

In the TH gene, separate regulatory elements mediate these responses: elements at −45 and −102 are essential for the response to cyclic AMP (19Kim K.-S. Lee M.K. Carroll J. Joh T.H. J. Biol.

In the DBH gene, a single region, spanning from −180 to −150 of the rat gene, (−189 to −176 of the human gene), mediates the response to both cyclic AMP and phorbol ester (16Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnai L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.-S. J. Biol.

Silverman R. Aguanno A. Albert V.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Genetic information located within this same region, named the DB1 enhancer in the rat gene, is also essential for basal and cell type specific expression from the DBH promoter (16Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnai L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.-S. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 1996; 36: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The close apposition of the basal, second messenger, and cell type specific regulatory regions has suggested an interaction between, or even identity of, the pathways leading to regulated expression of the DBH gene. The cellular response to cAMP is often mediated by transcription factors in the CREB/ATF family. The initial factor identified, CREB, undergoes phosphorylation by protein kinase A (PKA), which subsequently leads to activation of target genes containing a CRE regulatory DNA sequence (see 30Meyer R.E. Habener J.F. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 14: 269-290PubMed Google Scholar). Other members of the CREB/ATF family, including CREM and ATF-1, may also modulate transcription in response to cAMP. These factors can form heterodimers, and the composition of dimers influences the regulatory activity at the target genes. In addition to members of the CREB/ATF family, the AP-1 family of transcription factors has been implicated in the regulation of specific genes by cAMP. For example, the proenkephalin CRE-2 has been shown to interact with both Fos and Jun family proteins in chromaffin cell extracts (31MacArthur L. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2256-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and a JunD/ATF-3 heterodimer has been implicated in mediating the response to cAMP in neuroblastoma cells (32Chu J.-M. Tan Y. Kobierski L.A. Balsam L.B. Comb J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 59-68PubMed Google Scholar). For the TH and DBH genes, several factors have been reported to interact with the CREs. The CRE of the TH gene, which contains a perfect palindromic CRE consensus sequence (TGACGTCA), will bind purified CREB (17Lamouroux A. Houhou L. Faucon Biguet N. Serck-Hanssen G. Guibert B. Icard-Liepkalns C. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and has been demonstrated to interact with a CREM-like protein in extracts of neuronal cell lines (33Tinti C. Conti B. Cubells J.F. Kim K.-S. Baker H. Joh T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25375-25381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A dominant negative mutant of CREB causes partial inhibition of cAMP-mediated increase of transcription from the TH promoter (28Lazaroff N. Patankar S. Yoon S.O. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21579-21589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), further strengthening the possible involvement of CREB in this response. For the DBH gene, the CRE-like sequence of the rat DB1 regulatory element resembles the proenkephalin CRE-2 sequence (TGCGTCA) and has been reported to bind to ATF-1 in extracts from PC12 cells (29Afar R. Silverman R. Aguanno A. Albert V.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). For the human DBH gene, the CRE sequence (TGACGTCC) differs from that of the rat gene and has been shown to bind CREB, both as a purified protein and within cell extracts (17Lamouroux A. Houhou L. Faucon Biguet N. Serck-Hanssen G. Guibert B. Icard-Liepkalns C. Mallet J. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 364-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 34Seo H. Yang C. Kim H.-S. Kim K.-S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4102-4112Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular studies probing a functional interaction of CREB or ATF-1 with either rat or human DBH genes are yet to be described. Thus, several CRE-binding transcription factors remain candidates as mediators of the cellular response of the DBH gene to cAMP. In seeking the identity of proteins that interact with the DB1 regulatory element of the DBH gene, we have cloned a cDNA encoding a DB1-binding protein. This cDNA encodes a homeodomain protein, named Arix (35Zellmer E. Zhang Z. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is the rat homolog of mouse Phox2 (36Valarche I. Tissier-Seta J.P. Hirsh M.-R. Martinez S. Gordis C. Brunet J.-F. Development. 1993; 119: 881-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arix/Phox2 is specifically expressed in catecholaminergic tissues and cell lines, and the onset of expression during development is consistent with a role in determining the noradrenergic phenotype (37Groves A.K. George K.M. Tissier-Seta J.-P. Engel J.D. Brunet J.-F. Anderson D.J. Development. 1995; 121: 887-901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ernsberger J. Patzke H. Tissier-Seta J.P. Reh R. Goridis C. Rohrer H. Mech. Dev. 1995; 52: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 39Tiveron M.-C. Hirsch M.-R. Brunet J.-F. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7649-7660Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Arix binds to defined DNA sequences in the promoter proximal regions of both the TH and DBH genes (35Zellmer E. Zhang Z. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and transactivates the TH promoter when transfected into non-neuronal cell lines (35Zellmer E. Zhang Z. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Arix exhibits limited stimulatory activity when transfected with the DBH promoter into non-neuronal cell lines (35Zellmer E. Zhang Z. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the study described here, we have investigated the interaction between Arix and the second messenger systems activated through cAMP and have found that Arix augments the cAMP and PKA response of the DBH gene. An investigation of the transcription factors that may play a role in mediating the cAMP response of the DBH gene has implicated members of the CREB, CREM, Fos, and Jun families. These experiments suggest that the environmental factors that influence the catecholaminergic phenotype may act through stimulation of second messenger systems, which interact with a tissue-specific homeodomain protein to specify the noradrenergic phenotype. The PC12 cells used in these experiments are subclone GR5, isolated by Dr. Rae Nishi at the Oregon Health Sciences University. PC12 and F9 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 107 fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). HepG2 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium plus 107 fetal bovine serum, 17 nonessential amino acids, and 110 mg/liter sodium pyruvate. All cells were cultured in an atmosphere of humidified air containing 57 CO2. The construction of plasmids containing the promoter and 5′-flanking sequence of TH and DBH genes cloned adjacent to the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) transcription unit has been described previously (1Lewis E.J. Harrington C.A. Chikaraishi D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3550-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 16Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnai L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids containing deletions or point mutations of the DBH promoter region were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of plasmid 5′DBH-CAT (−232/+14) using the Sculptor in vitromutagenesis system (Amersham), according to the recommended procedures. RSV-Arix contains Arix cDNA sequences 1–1353, which includes all 5′-untranslated and protein coding sequences and 313 bases of the Arix 3′-untranslated sequence (35Zellmer E. Zhang Z. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cDNA segment is cloned into pSPRSV, where Arix transcription is under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and enhancer elements. pSPRSV also contains a poly(A) addition signal from simian virus 40. The original RSV-Arix, described in Zellmer et al. (35Zellmer E. Zhang Z. Greco D. Rhodes J. Cassel S. Lewis E.J. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 8109-8120Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), contained an extensive vector sequence in the 5′-untranslated sequence, which had been transferred to the Arix cDNA from several cloning steps. This extraneous sequence was removed from RSV-Arix, and the new expression vector exhibited improved transcription regulatory activity. All experiments, except those in Fig. 4 using F9 cells, were performed using the RSV-Arix construct without the vector-derived 5′-untranslated sequence. Results with the two constructs are qualitatively similar. The construction of RSV-PKA was described in Maurer (40Maurer R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6870-6873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the K-CREB expression plasmid was described in Walton et al.(41Walton K.M. Rehfuss R.P. Chrivia J.C. Lochner J.E. Goodman R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 647-655PubMed Google Scholar). DNA used for transfection was purified using the Promega Wizard kit. Following purification according to the manufacturer's procedures, DNA was precipitated from ethanol in the presence of ammonium acetate. Cell cultures, in 100-mm culture dishes, were transfected with DNA using calcium phosphate, as described previously (16Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnai L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar). Cell cultures contained 3–6 × 106 cells/dish. All transfections contained 2–3 ॖg of pRSV-L, encoding the luciferase transcription unit under the control of promoter and enhancer elements of RSV. In any given experiment, all cultures contained the same amount of transfected DNA, which ranged from 15 to 23 ॖg. Cells were harvested 2 days after transfection, and aliquots of cell extracts were assayed for protein content, CAT activity (43Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5286) Google Scholar), and luciferase activity (44de Wet J.R. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). In experiments using inducers, these agents were added 18 h before harvesting of cells. PC12 cells were treated with 200 ॖmCPT-cAMP, whereas HepG2 cultures were treated with 1 mm8-Br-cAMP. The choice of cAMP analog for each cell line was based upon previous publications demonstrating the efficacy of that compound in stimulating transcription from a cAMP-responsive promoter (45Liu J. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Fossom L.H. Sterling C.R. Tank A.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 898-908PubMed Google Scholar). CAT activity is standardized to cotransfected luciferase, except when cAMP analogs or RSV-PKA are used. Preliminary experimental results indicated a stimulatory effect of cAMP and PKA on the RSV promoter in RSV-L. For experiments using cAMP or PKA, CAT activity is standardized to total extract protein. Crude nuclear extracts were made from PC12 cells following the method of Dignam et al. (47Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G.

Additionally, all buffers used contained Pefabloc (0.2 mg/ml; Boehringer Mannheim), leupeptin (0.5 ॖg/ml), and pepstatin (0.7 ॖg/ml) as protease inhibitors and NaF (10 mm) as a phosphatase inhibitor. The nuclear extracts were dialyzed against nuclear extract buffer consisting of 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 207 glycerol, 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm NaF. Protein concentration of each nuclear extract was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and aliquots were frozen and stored at −70 °C. Synthetic sense and antisense oligonucleotides were end labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed. The EMSAs were carried out in a 20-ॖl final volume containing 12.5 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 107 glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 ॖg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Nuclear extract protein concentrations were adjusted to 1.7 ॖg/ॖl with nuclear extract buffer containing bovine serum albumin. Labeled probe (10,000–25,000 cpm Cerenkov counts) was added to the reaction buffer containing 5 ॖg of nuclear extracts and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. For competition EMSAs, reaction mixtures containing nuclear extracts were preincubated for 20 min in the presence of double-stranded competitor oligonucleotides (200 ng) prior to the incubation with the labeled oligonucleotide probe. Samples were loaded carefully to minimize mixing, and the complexes were resolved on 67 nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) using an electrophoresis buffer containing 45 mm Tris borate and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were dried, and protein-DNA complexes were visualized autoradiographically. The sequences of the wild type DB1 enhancer and mutant CRE2/HD1m oligonucleotides as well as consensus CRE, AP1, and AP2 oligonucleotide sequences used as probes and competitors are given in Fig. 5. To identify protein constituents of EMSA complexes, antisera directed against several putative cAMP-responsive transcription factors of the CREB/CREM/ATF family, plus antisera broadly reactive against Fos and Jun family members, were tested in EMSAs. Nuclear extracts and reaction buffer components were preincubated together with 2 ॖg of affinity-purified IgG (or 1 ॖl of whole antiserum) for 20 min at room temperature prior to a 30-min incubation with labeled probe and separated by electrophoresis as described above. Several different antisera against CREB and ATF-1 were tested in these analyses with similar results. The following is a list of antisera characterized in EMSA: CREB-1 (sc-271x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), mouse monoclonal IgG against human CREB-1 p43; CREB (no. 9192, New England Biolabs), rabbit polyclonal IgG against amino acids 123–137 of human CREB; ATF-1 (sc-241x), mouse monoclonal IgA against human ATF-1; ATF-1 (UBI 06-325, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), sheep polyclonal IgG against amino acids 1–30 of human ATF-1; CREM (UBI 06-350), CREM/ICER family reactive rabbit antisera against mouse CREM-Tau; αfos (sc-253x), Fos family reactive rabbit polyclonal IgG against amino acids 128–152 of human c-fos p62; αjun (sc-44x), Jun family reactive rabbit polyclonal IgG against amino acids 247–263 of mouse c-Jun p39. Previous studies have demonstrated the transcriptional responsiveness of the DBH promoter to stimulation of both PKA and the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase C) pathways (16Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnai L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.-S. J. Biol.

Positive regulatory elements within the DBH proximal promoter region function to drive transcription of a reporter gene in neuronally derived cell lines, whereas lower levels of transcription are observed in non-neuronal cell lines (16Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnai L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single region contains both the cell type-specific and second messenger stimulatory elements. This region falls between −180 and −150 in the rat promoter and between −189 and −176 in the human DBH promoter (16Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnai L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,20Ishiguro H. Kim K.T. Joh T.H. Kim K.-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17987-17994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of this critical region of the rat promoter is presented in Fig. 1. The cell type-specific responsiveness of the proximal DBH promoter to cAMP stimulation was assessed by transient transfection of the DBH-CAT (−232/+14) reporter construct into either the catecholaminergic PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line or into the non-neuronal HepG2 hepatoma or C6 glioma cells. This DBH-CAT construct encompasses 232 bases of the promoter and 5′-flanking sequences of the DBH gene containing the critical enhancer region described above (illustrated in Fig. 1). Following transfection, the cells were either left untreated (basal) or treated with a cAMP analog. In PC12 cells, CPT-cAMP stimulated DBH-CAT transcription 28-fold over basal cultures (Fig.2 A). This cAMP-dependent activation of DBH-CAT has been described previously in catecholaminergic cell lines, both with the DBH proximal promoter region and with the 30-base DB1 regulatory element, encompassing bases −150 to −180 (16Shaskus J. Greco D. Asnai L.P. Lewis E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18821-18830Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Afar R. Silverman R. Aguanno A. Albert V.R. Mol. Brain Res. 1996; 36: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, when DBH-CAT was transfected into HepG2 cells, treatment with 8-Br-cAMP evoked little stimulation of transcription from the DBH promoter (Fig.2 A). Similarly, C6 glioma cells showed no stimulation of DBH-CAT transcription by cAMP treatment (data not shown). The DBH-CAT construct used in the present experiments lacks the tissue-specific negative regulatory element found between −280 and −232 (49Shaskus J. Zellmer E. Lewis E.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 52-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), eliminating the possibility of interference of this element on the cAMP-evoked response. In agreement with our results, Kimet al. (27Kim K.S. Ishiguro H. Tinti C. Wagner J. Joh T.H. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 7200-7207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the human DBH reporter is unresponsive to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase in the non-neuronal HeLa and C6 glioma cell lines, whereas a substantial increase in transcription was observed in a catecholaminergic neuroblastoma cell line. In their study, the DBH-CAT construct used contained the negative regulatory element, but the experiment described in Fig. 2 A demonstrates that even in the absence of this inhibitory sequence, the DBH promoter is unresponsive to cAMP treatment in a non-neuronal cell line. Because the non-neuronal cell lines used in our study have been shown to possess the intracellular machinery for second messenger-mediated transcription of other genes (45Liu J. Park E.A. Gurney A.L. Roesler W.J. Hanson R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19095-19102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Comb M. Mermod N. Hyman S.E. Pearlberg J. Ross M.E. Goodman H.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3793-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), the above results suggest that catecholaminergic cells may possess a cell type-specific coactivator necessary for cAMP-mediated DBH transcription. The tissue-restricted pattern of Arix expression and the juxtaposition of the homeodomain binding sites and second messenger response elements led to the hypothesis that Arix may be one such cell type-specific coactivator necessary for stimulated transcription of the DBH promoter. Therefore, we tested whether transfection of an Arix expression plasmid (RSV-Arix) into HepG2 cells altered the response of DBH-CAT to cAMP-mediated activation. In contrast to non-Arix-expressing HepG2 cells, cultures transfected with Arix exhibit a substantially increased transcriptional response to cAMP (Fig. 2 A). Although Arix alone induced a 5-fold increase in DBH-CAT"

Basal α1b-adrenoreceptor phosphorylation was markedly increased by endothelin-1, norepinephrine, and phorbol esters. The effect of endothelin-1 was dose dependent (EC50 ≈ 1 nm), reached its maximum 5 min after stimulation, and was inhibited by BQ-123, an antagonist selective for ETA receptors. Endothelin-1-induced α1b-adrenoreceptor phosphorylation was attenuated by staurosporine or genistein and essentially abolished when both inhibitors were used together. The effect of norepinephrine was not modified by either staurosporine or genistein alone, and it was only partially inhibited when both were used together. These data suggest the participation of protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase(s) in endothelin-1-induced receptor phosphorylation. However, phosphoaminoacid analysis revealed the presence of phosphoserine and traces of phosphothreonine, but not of phosphotyrosine, suggesting that the putative tyrosine kinase(s), activated by endothelin, could act in a step previous to receptor phosphorylation. The effect of endothelin-1 on α1b-adrenoreceptor phosphorylation was not mediated through pertussis toxin-sensitive G proteins. Calcium mobilization induced by norepinephrine was diminished by endothelin-1. Norepinephrine and endothelin-1 increased [35S]GTPγS binding to control membranes. The effect of norepinephrine was abolished in membranes obtained from cells pretreated with endothelin-1. Interestingly, genistein plus staurosporine inhibited this effect of the endothelial peptide. Endothelin-1 did not induce α1b-adrenoreceptor internalization.

It is generally accepted that their function and cellular distribution (internalization/recycling) are, at least partially, regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation processes. The roles that different serine-threonine kinases specific for G protein-coupled receptors (GRKs) and second messenger-regulated kinases (like protein kinase A and PKC) play in such events have been extensively studied but remain yet only partially known, and some aspects of their function are still controversial (for reviews, see Refs. 5Benovic J.L.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). The complexity of the problem of assigning roles to specific isoforms is exemplified by the ability of messenger-regulated kinases to modulate the activity of GRKs (crosstalk) (reviewed in Ref.7Chuang T.T.

On the other hand, in rat-1 fibroblasts, endothelin increases IP3 production and activates PKC (18Van der Bend R.L. De Widt J. Van Corven E.J. Moolenaar W.H. Van Blitterswijk W. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 235-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Interestingly, many other signaling processes are also activated by this endothelial peptide. Thus, endothelin inhibits adenylyl cyclase through pertussis toxin-sensitive GTP-binding proteins, turning off the activity of protein kinase A (19James A.F. Xie L.-H. Fujitani Y. Hayashi S. Horie M.

It also stimulates the phosphorylation of several proteins in tyrosine residues and activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in rat-1 fibroblasts and other cell types (19James A.F.

The ability of endothelin receptors to elicit activation of different cellular pathways allows them to influence the activity of other receptors present in the same cell. Recently, it has been elegantly demonstrated that ET-1 transmodulates positively the activity of epidermal growth factor receptors in rat-1 fibroblasts (26Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). In this study, it was observed that activation of ETA receptors elicited phosphorylation of epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors and its association with Grb-2 and Shc; i.e. ET-1 induces the activation of EGF receptors in the absence of its ligand (26Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we demonstrated that tetradecanoylphorbol acetate (TPA) attenuates the action of α1b-ARs transfected into rat-1 fibroblasts (17Vázquez-Prado J. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 17-22PubMed Google Scholar). It has already been demonstrated that in these cells, activation of PKC by phorbol esters results in the phosphorylation of this transfected receptor (9Lattion A.-L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol.

In the present work, the effect of activation of endothelin ETA receptors (that are endogenously expressed in rat-1 cells) on the phosphorylation of α1b-ARs was examined. Since it is known that ET-1 induces activation of tyrosine kinases in rat-1 cells, the signaling pathways that participate in such effect were explored.

Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 17-22PubMed Google Scholar). In the present experiments, cells at confluence were serum deprived in unsupplemented DMEM for 24 h. Membranes (100 ॖg) from rat-1 cells expressing α1b-AR (2–2.5 pmol/mg protein), prepared as described previously (17Vázquez-Prado J. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. Mol.

After this treatment, membranes were centrifuged at 12,700 × g for 15 min, washed, and electrophoresed in 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The specificity of the labeling was determined using phentolamine or prazosin as competitors. Immunoprecipitation of α1b-AR was standardized using photoaffinity-labeled membranes. Rabbit antiserum against the decapeptide of the carboxyl terminus sequence of the hamster α1b-AR was obtained by immunizing rabbits with the indicated peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Serum samples with a titer above 1:5000, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (peptide), were used. Membranes were solubilized with 1 ml of solubilization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.07 Triton X-100, 0.057 SDS, 50 mm NaF, 100 ॖmNa3VO4, 10 mm ॆ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phosphoserine, 1 mm phosphothreonine, and the previously mentioned protease inhibitors at the concentrations indicated) for 1 h at 4 °C; the extracts were centrifuged at 12,700 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes containing 10 ॖl of immune serum and 40 ॖl of Sepharose-coupled protein A (1:1 (v/v) slurry). Tubes were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed five times (1 ml/each) with 50 mm Hepes, 50 mmNaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, containing 1.07 Triton X-100, 0.057 SDS, and 100 mm NaF; once with 50 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4; and once with 10 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Washed beads were boiled in 100 ॖl of Laemmli sample buffer containing 57 mercaptoethanol and electrophoresed in 107 SDS-polyacrylamide minigels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and exposed to X-Omat x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) at −80 °C with an intensifying screen. Autoradiographs were analyzed with the Collage software, version 2.0. Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing the α1b-AR were grown to confluence in 10-cm culture dishes and serum starved for 24 h. On the day of the experiment, cells were maintained in phosphate-free DMEM during 1 h and then incubated in 3 ml of the same medium containing [32P]Pi (0.05 mCi/ml) for 3 h at 37 °C. Labeled cells were stimulated with ET-1, norepinephrine, EGF, or TPA as indicated; then they were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized with 1.0 ml of ice-cold solubilization buffer. The plates were maintained for 1 h on ice; then the extracts were centrifuged at 12,700 × g for 15 min, at 4 °C, and the supernatants were transferred to new tubes containing 10 ॖl of anti-α1b-AR antiserum and 40 ॖl of Sepharose-coupled protein A and immunoprecipitated as described above. The effect of staurosporine, genistein, and wortmannin on the phosphorylation of α1b-AR was assayed by preincubating these agents in labeling medium for the time and concentrations indicated in the figures. The amount of phosphorylated receptor was determined by densitometric analysis of autoradiographs or by PhosphorImager analysis. At least three independent experiments were performed for each treatment. Data were analyzed and plotted using commercial software (Prism 2.01, GraphPad Software). Transfected rat-1 fibroblasts, in 10-cm dishes, were incubated for 16–24 h with or without PTX (100 ng/ml). The presence of PTX was continued throughout the phosphorylation period. Pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation was carried out as described previously (29Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. Huerta-Bahena M.E. Malbon C.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 256: C384-C389Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitated phosphorylated receptors were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and hydrolyzed in 0.2 ml of 6 n HCl at 110 °C for 1.5 h. Samples were then centrifuged at 12,700 × g for 5 min, and the acid supernatants were evaporated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator (Speed Vac). Hydrolyzed samples were solubilized in a mixture of cold phosphoaminoacid standards (Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P), 25 nmol each) and analyzed by two dimensional thin layer cellulose electrophoresis, using 750 V for each dimension (30Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1272) Google Scholar). Overnight serum-deprived confluent cultures were treated with the different agents to be tested, washed, and scraped with a rubber policeman in buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 100 ॖmNa3VO4, 10 mm ॆ-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mmMgCl2, and the previously mentioned protease inhibitors at the concentrations indicated. Membranes were prepared according to the method of Mattingly et al. (31Mattingly R.R. Wasilenko W.J. Woodring P.J. Garrison J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7470-7477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). [35S]GTPγS binding was performed as described by Wieland and Jakobs (32Wieland T. Jakobs K.H. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In brief, membranes were preincubated in binding buffer supplemented with 100 ॖm Gpp(NH)p, 100 ॖmGDP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol for 30 min at 30 °C in a shaking water bath. After this preincubation, membranes were washed and resuspended in binding buffer without nucleotides. The binding reaction was carried out in a volume of 250 ॖl for 30 min at 30 °C in the same buffer containing 0.2 nm [35S]GTPγS. The reaction was initiated by the addition of membranes (25 ॖg of protein/tube) and terminated by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold binding buffer without EDTA and filtration on Whatman GF/C filters using a Brandel harvester. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 100 ॖm Gpp(NH)p and represented ≈107 of total binding. Filters were washed three times and dried, and radioactivity was measured with a liquid scintillation counter. Statistical analysis between comparable groups was performed using analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls analysis. Confluent fibroblasts were incubated overnight in DMEM without serum and antibiotics. Cells were loaded with 5 ॖm Fura-2/AM in Krebs-Ringer-Hepes containing 0.057 bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were detached by gentle trypsinization (17Vázquez-Prado J. Garcı́a-Sáinz J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 17-22PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence measurements were carried as described, but the excitation monochromators were set at 340 and 380 nm, with a chopper interval of 0.5 s, and the emission monochromator was set at 510 nm. [Ca2+] i was calculated according to the method of Grynkiewicz et al. (33Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using the software provided by AMINCO-Bowman; traces were directly exported to the graphs. Intact cell receptor binding assays were performed as described by Diviani et al. (10Diviani D. Lattion A.-L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5049-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) by incubating cell monolayers grown in 24-well clusters containing 1 nm[3H]prazosin. Incubation was at 4 °C for 12–15 h. After binding, cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, and counted. Phentolamine (10 ॖm) was used to determine nonspecific binding which was ≈107 of total binding. A polyclonal rabbit antibody directed against the last 10 amino acids of the hamster α1b-AR carboxyl terminus was generated and used for immunoprecipitation. To define that the receptor was immunoprecipitated, membranes where the receptor was labeled by photoaffinity cross-linking with aryl-125I-azidoprazosin were used. Photoaffinity labeling of the rat-1 membranes resulted in a major band with a molecular weight of ≈85,000 (Fig. 1 a), which is within the expected size for the α1b-AR (9Lattion A.-L. Diviani D. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22887-22893Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Diviani D. Lattion A.-L. Larbi N. Kunapuli P. Pronin A. Benovic J.L. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5049-5058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). As anticipated, the labeling was blocked with phentolamine (Fig.1 a) and prazosin (data not shown), confirming the identity of the receptor. Other minor bands were also observed after prolonged exposure of the gels: a band of high molecular weight (>150,000), which may correspond to aggregates of receptors or oligomers (34Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.-P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar); and two other faint bands with molecular weights of ≈40,000 and ≈25,000. These later two bands do not seem to correspond to the receptor since they were also observed when the labeling was performed in the presence of phentolamine (Fig. 1 a). Fig.1 b shows that the α1b-AR is immunoprecipitated from aryl-125I-azidoprazosin-labeled membranes; the procedure was very reproducible and most efficient when the incubation with the antibody was performed overnight at 4 °C (70–807 of the labeled receptor was immunoprecipitated under these conditions; range of 3 determinations in 3 experiments using different membrane preparations) compared with 1 h at the same temperature (Fig.1 b). Co-immunoprecipitation of the high molecular weight band and of the nonspecific band with a molecular weight of ≈40,000 was observed in some of the experiments. No immunoprecipitation of α1b-AR was detected when preimmune serum was used as control in the same conditions under which a maximum efficiency was achieved with immune serum (Fig. 1 b). Antiserum against α1b-AR identified the receptor in Western blots of membranes obtained from α1b-AR-transfected rat-1 fibroblasts but no signal was detected in membranes from α1a-AR-transfected cells (data not shown). It can be observed in Fig. 2 that a labeled band with a molecular weight of ≈85,000 was immunoprecipitated from rat-1 cells metabolically labeled with radioactive phosphate. Such basal receptor phosphorylation was markedly increased in cells treated for 5 min with 10 ॖm norepinephrine, 10 nm ET-1, or 1 ॖm TPA. The ET-1-stimulated α1b-AR phosphorylation took place very rapidly, reaching its maximum at 5 min (Fig. 3, a and b) and gradually decreasing afterward. The effect was dependent on the concentration of ET-1 used, with an apparent EC50 of ≈1.3 nm (Fig. 4, a andb). The stimulation of α1b-AR phosphorylation by 10 nm ET-1 was inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by BQ-123 (Fig. 4,d and e), a selective ETA receptor antagonist (IC50 ≈ 235 nm,K i ≈25 nm). The K i obtained is within what has been observed for ETA receptors (35Nambi P. Pullen M. Wu H.L. Lee D. Saunders D. Heys R. Aiyar N. Leber J. Elliott J. Brooks D. Holstein E. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 277: 1567-1571PubMed Google Scholar), which is the subtype present in rat-1 cells (36Ambar I. Sokolovsky M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1993; 245: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). No effect of the antagonist on the basal phosphorylation of the α1b-AR was detected (data not shown). The action of norepinephrine was also dose dependent, showing an apparent EC50 of 25 nm; the effect of norepinephrine was of a smaller magnitude than that of ET-1 (Fig. 4, a and c) but had a very similar time course (Fig. 3, a and b).Figure 3Time courses of the effects of ET-1 and norepinephrine on α1b-AR phosphorylation. Rat-1 fibroblasts expressing α1b-ARs were metabolically labeled with [32P]Pi and incubated for the times indicated with 10 ॖm norepinephrine (NE) or 10 nm ET-1.

A representative autoradiograph is shown in e.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) As indicated before, some effects of ET-1 have been reported to be mediated by activation of PKC, whereas other actions seem to involve tyrosine kinases. Therefore, we investigated the participation of these enzymes in the events that lead to the phosphorylation of the α1b-AR. Preincubation of the cells with either the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein, or the PKC-inhibitor, staurosporine, inhibited only partially the α1b-AR phosphorylation elicited by ET-1 (Fig. 5,a, b, e, and f, and Fig. 5,c–f; respectively). None of these inhibitors blocked the α1b-AR phosphorylation induced by norepinephrine (Fig. 5, e and f). When these inhibitors were used together, they essentially abolished the phosphorylation of the α1b-AR induced by ET-1 and reduced the effect of norepinephrine (Fig. 5, e and f). No effect of the inhibitors on the basal phosphorylation of the α1b-AR was detected (data not shown). Wortmannin (100 nm) did not"
https://openalex.org/W2053544663,"An understanding of the role of CaM kinase II in the pancreatic ॆ-cell is dependent on the identification of its cellular targets. One of the best substrates of CaM kinase II in vitro that could function in secretory events is the microtubule-associated protein, MAP-2. By immunoblot analysis, a high molecular weight protein with electrophoretic properties characteristic of MAP-2, was identified in rat insulinoma ॆTC3 cells and isolated rat islets. In immunoprecipitation experiments employing α-toxin-permeabilized ॆTC3 cells, elevation of intracellular Ca2+ or addition of forskolin, an adenylate cyclase activator, induced significant phosphorylation of MAP-2 in situ. The effect of Ca2+ was rapid, concentration-dependent and closely correlated with activation of CaM kinase II under similar experimental conditions. H-89, a specific and potent inhibitor of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), prevented forskolin-induced MAP-2 phosphorylation but had little effect on MAP-2 phosphorylation stimulated by elevated Ca2+. Phosphopeptide mapping revealed that the phosphorylation pattern observed in situ upon incubation of the ॆTC3 cells with increased free Ca2+, was strikingly similar to that generated in vitro by CaM kinase II, most notably with regard to the increased phosphate incorporated into one prominent site. These data provide evidence that MAP-2 is phosphorylated by CaM kinase II in the pancreatic ॆ-cell in situ, and that this event may provide an important link in the mediation of Ca2+-dependent insulin secretion.

Circumstantial evidence supports a functional role of the multifunctional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) 1The abbreviations used are: CaM kinase II, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; MAP-2, microtubule-associated protein-2; PKA, protein kinase A; TPCK,l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone. in the regulation of insulin secretion from the pancreatic ॆ-cell. Principal within this evidence is the demonstration that glucose, the major physiological regulator of insulin secretion in rodents and humans (1Hedeskov C.J. Physiol. Rev. 1980; 60: 442-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), activates CaM kinase II in isolated rat islets in a concentration-dependent manner (2Wenham R.M. Landt M. Easom R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4947-4952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that temporally correlates with the initial and sustained phases of insulin secretion (3Easom R.A. Filler N.R. Ings E.I. Tarpley J. Landt M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Other data utilizing pharmacological inhibitors (i.e.KN-62, KN-93) of this enzyme have also implicated CaM kinase II in the regulation of insulin secretion (4Wenham R.M. Landt M. Walters S.M. Hidaka H. Easom R.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 5Niki I. Okazaki K. Saitoh M. Niki A. Niki H. Tamagawa T. Iguchi A. Hidaka H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), although conclusions made from such studies are complicated by nonspecific effects demonstrated by these drugs (6Clyne C. Nguyen A. Rainey W. Endocr. Res. 1995; 21: 259-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 7Li G. Hidaka H. Wollheim C.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 489-498PubMed Google Scholar). Another study that reports the inability of KN-62 to inhibit Ca2+-induced insulin secretion from the permeabilized ॆ-cell (7Li G. Hidaka H. Wollheim C.B. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 42: 489-498PubMed Google Scholar) argues, however, against a role of CaM kinase II in the insulin secretory process. Irrespective of the relevance of CaM kinase II to the ॆ-cell secretory process, the understanding of the physiological consequence of the activation of CaM kinase II is dependent on the identification of target substrates in the ॆ-cell. A large number of cellular proteins are phosphorylated by CaM kinase II in vitro (8Braun A.P. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 417-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), but relatively few of these have been proven as legitimate substratesin situ. Prominent among this latter group, however, is the microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2), which has been shown to be phosphorylated by CaM kinase II in GH3 cells (9Jefferson A.B. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 346-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or hippocampal slices (10Diaz-Nido J. Montoro R.J. Lopez-Barneo J. Avila J. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 818-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) stimulated with depolarizing concentrations of potassium. MAP-2 is a member of a larger family of microtubule-associated proteins that have the capacity to regulate reversible polymerization and stability of microtubules through their affinity for tubulin (11Sloboda R. Dentler W. Rosenbaum J. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4497-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) as well as their interaction with other cellular structures such as actin (12Sattilaro R. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2003-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). This regulatory capacity is in turn controlled by the phosphorylation state of MAP-2, at least in vitro (13Raffaelli N. Yamauchi P.S. Purich D.L. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Although a minimal extent of MAP-2 phosphorylation appears to be essential for MAP-2 function (14Brugg B. Matus A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), phosphorylation by specific kinases in vitrohas resulted in reduced affinity to microtubules, reduced rate and extent of assembly, accentuated disassembly, and reduced interaction of microtubules with actin filaments (15Maccioni R.B. Cambiazo V. Physiol. Rev. 1995; 75: 835-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In optimal conditions, isolated MAP-2 has been demonstrated to incorporate phosphate to the level of 46 mol/mol of MAP-2 (16Tsuyama S. Terayama Y. Matsuyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10886-10892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although MAP-2 is phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases including the phospholipid-dependent protein kinase C (17Ainsztein A.M. Purich D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28465-28471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (18Theurkauf W.E. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3284-3290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), MAP-2 is considered one of the best substrates for CaM kinase II with the stoichiometry of phosphorylation reported to be from 5 to over 20 mol of phosphate/mol of MAP-2 (19Yamamoto H. Fukunaga K. Goto S. Tanaka E. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Based on the established involvement of the microtubule network in insulin secretion (20Somers G. Blondel B. Orci L. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1979; 104: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Lacy P.E. Walker M.M. Fink C.J. Diabetes. 1972; 21: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 22Lacy P.E.

Science. 1976; 191: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the suspected association of CaM kinase II with the cytoskeleton of the ॆ-cell (24Harrison D.E. Ashcroft S.J.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 714: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), it was of interest to evaluate the potential of this enzyme to phosphorylate MAP-2 in these cells. Preliminary studies have established that CaM kinase II can be efficiently activated by Ca2+ in the permeabilized ॆ-cell. Therefore, to counter the inherent problem of a high level of basal MAP-2 phosphorylation, this model has been chosen to permit the study of phosphate incorporation from a high specific activity radionucleotide pool on a 舠silent舡 background. The correlation of MAP-2 phosphorylation to CaM kinase II activation and CaM kinase II activation to glucose-induced secretion, supports the hypothesis that a calcium-induced phosphorylation of MAP-2 by CaM kinase II may function as an important intermediate step in insulin secretion. ॆTC3 cells were obtained from Dr. Shimon Efrat (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, New York). RPMI 1640, glutamine, antibiotics, trypsin/EDTA, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Protein A-Sepharose, monoclonal anti-MAP-2 (clone HM-2), purified bovine brain MAP-2, and α-hemolysin (Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin) were purchased from Sigma.

Anti-MAP-2 polyclonal antibody was raised against a heat-stable preparation of rat brain MAP-2 prepared by the method of Fellous et al.(26Fellous A. Francon J. Lennon A.M. Nunez J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar); the resulting antisera were purified to an IgG fraction enriched in anti-MAP-2 by chromatography on MAP-2-agarose. Mouse recombinant Ca2+/calmodulin protein kinase IIα was generously provided by Dr. Roger Colbran (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN). cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit from bovine heart was donated by Dr. Ben Harris (University of North Texas Health Science Ctr., Fort Worth, TX). All other chemicals were of the finest reagent grade available. ॆTC3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 107 fetal bovine serum, 100 ॖg/ml penicillin, and 50 ॖg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 57 CO2. In preparation for permeabilization, ॆTC3 cells were detached (Trypsin/EDTA) and equilibrated in suspension in culture medium for a minimum of 2 h. Following a brief centrifugation, the cells were washed twice with Ca2+-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate/Hepes buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 115 mm NaCl, 24 mm NaHCO3, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm MgCl2) containing 1 mm EGTA, 6 mm glucose, and 0.17 bovine serum albumin. After counting, permeabilization was initiated by the addition of S. aureus toxin, α-hemolysin, to a concentration of 125–200 units/106 cell/0.1 ml Ca2+-free permeabilization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 140 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, and 300 ॖm Na2ATP). Permeabilization was conducted at 37 °C for 15 min with the efficiency monitored by visualizing trypan blue accessibility to >607 and then terminated by the addition of ice-cold Ca2+-free permeabilization buffer (washing twice). Cells were resuspended in permeabilization buffer containing 0.05 ॖm Ca2+ and placed on ice prior to experimental treatments. Free Ca2+ concentrations in incubation buffers were determined using a Ca2+ electrode (Orion) calibrated against known standards as described by Bers (27Bers D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1982; 242: C404-C408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The permeabilization of ॆTC3 by α-toxin induces the formation in the plasma membrane of pores of defined diameter (∼2 nm) permitting ions and nucleotide access to the intracellular space without the loss of intracellular proteins (28Ahnert-Hilger G. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 77-82Google Scholar). Pancreatic islets were isolated from male Wistar rats (Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Indianapolis, IN) by collagenase P (Boehringer Mannheim) digestion and subsequent enrichment by centrifugation on a Ficoll gradient as described previously (2Wenham R.M. Landt M. Easom R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4947-4952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoblot analyses were performed on nitrocellulose membranes using a Western-LightTM protein detection kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA). Incubations with primary antibodies (rabbit polyclonal or monoclonal anti-MAP-2) were conducted overnight at 4 °C in blocking buffer. For the determination of CaM kinase II activation, 5 × 105 permeabilized cells were incubated in buffer (500 ॖl) containing varying concentrations of free Ca2+ for 1 min at 37 °C. CaM kinase II activity was assayed in sonicated homogenates using autocamtide-2 as substrate by a method described previously (29Babb E.L. Tarpley J. Landt M. Easom R.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).32Pi incorporation into autocamtide-2 was determined by Cerenkov radiation (Beckman). The activity of CaM kinase II in the absence of Ca2+/calmodulin (autonomous activity) expressed as percentage of total activity in the presence of Ca2+ was used as a measure of enzyme activation. Immunoprecipitation conditions were optimized for specific activity of [γ-32P]ATP, cell number, MAP-2 antibody/protein A ratio, and degree of permeabilization. Permeabilized ॆTC3 cells (approximately 2 × 106/condition) were preincubated at 37 °C for 5 min in 0.05 ॖmCa2+ permeabilization buffer, including kinase inhibitors when appropriate. The cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 200 ॖl of either 0.05 ॖm or 5–10 ॖmCa2+ permeabilization buffer with 300 ॖm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 0.333 Ci/mmol) containing kinase inhibitors or activators when appropriate, and incubated at 37 °C for the indicated times. Phosphorylation was terminated by brief centrifugation (8,000 × g), washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (137 mmNaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mmNa2HPO4, 1.47 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.2) supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate), and finally resuspension of the cells in 300 ॖl of ice-cold RIPA buffer (0.01 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.15m NaCl, 17 Nonidet P-40, 17 sodium deoxycholate, 0.17 SDS, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 ॖg/ml leupeptin). The cells were lysed in this RIPA buffer for 45 min at 4 °C on a rotating platform before clarification by centrifugation (12 min at 100,000 × g at 4 °C). The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and incubated with polyclonal anti-rat MAP-2 antibody (1:100 dilution) for 2 h at 4 °C. Preswelled and washed protein A-Sepharose was added (25 ॖl), and the incubation continued for another 2 h at 4 °C on the rotating platform. The immune complexes bound to protein A-Sepharose were pelleted by centrifugation (3 min at 8,000 × g at 4 °C), and the pellets were washed twice with RIPA buffer. The immunoprecipitation pellets were resuspended in 35 ॖl of 2 × SDS sample buffer (124 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 6 mm SDS, 47 2-mercaptoethanol, 107 glycerol, 0.0077 bromphenol blue) and boiled for 10 min. Dissociated protein A-Sepharose was removed by centrifugation, and a portion (20 ॖl) of the supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis on a 57 gel. Selected gels were silver stained to verify equality of protein loading. Dried gels were developed by autoradiography and32P-incorporation into MAP-2 quantified by densitometry using Optimas 4.0 and Scanalytics, ZERODscan 1.0, video imaging software. Purified MAP-2 (20 ॖg) was phosphorylated by the PKA catalytic subunit, or mouse recombinant CaM kinase IIα as described (9Jefferson A.B. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 346-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the following exceptions; the PKA mixture was without exogenously added CaCl2, and the reaction volume of 50 ॖl contained [γ-32P]ATP (2 Ci/mmol) and 500 ng of kinase. Reactions proceeded for 18 min at 30 °C and were terminated by rapid chilling on ice. For phosphopeptide mapping, 32P-labeled MAP-2 was eluted from gel slices by incubation in 50 mmNH4HCO3, pH 7.3–7.6, initially supplemented with 17 ॆ-mercaptoethanol and 0.17 SDS for 18 h at 25 °C, and then without supplement for a further 3 h. The eluates were pooled, and the eluted MAP-2 was precipitated by the addition of a final concentration of 167 trichloroacetic acid (for 1 h on ice) in the presence of 20 ॖg heat-denatured RNase as carrier. In vitro phosphorylated MAP-2 was similarly precipitated at this step. The precipitate was resuspended in oxidizing solution (50 ॖl of performic acid) and then digested by the addition of 10 ॖg TPCK-treated trypsin for 18 h at 37 °C and then another 10 ॖg for a further 2.5 h. After repeated lyophilizing, the proteolytic digests were resuspended in electrophoresis buffer (2.57 formic acid and 7.87 glacial acetic acid, v/v) and spotted onto cellulose thin-layer plates. Two-dimensional separation of phosphopeptides by electrophoresis and chromatography was performed on a HTLE 7000 thin-layer electrophoresis apparatus (C. B. S. Scientific, La Jolla, CA) as described (30van der Geer P. Luo K. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Celis J. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook.3. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 422-448Google Scholar) except that the electrophoresis and chromatography steps were conducted at 1.3 kV for 25 min and for 14 h using a phosphochromatography buffer (37.57n-butanol, 257 pyridine, 7.57 glacial acetic acid, v/v), respectively. Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. determined from at least three independent observations unless otherwise stated. Differences were assessed statistically through the employment of the most appropriate tests, either a two-way or one-way parametric ANOVA with Dunnett's multiple range test or with an independent t test (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). p < 0.05 indicates statistical significance. MAP-2 has been extensively characterized in mammalian brain where it is concentrated in dendritic processes (31Olmstedt J.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1986; 2: 421-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 32De Camilli P. Miller P.E. Levitt P. Walter U. Greengard P. Neuroscience. 1984; 11: 761-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 33Caceres A. Payne M.R. Binder L.I. Steward O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 1738-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) accounting for as much as 17 of the total cytoplasmic protein. In contrast, MAP-2 levels are much lower in non-neuronal tissues (34Valdivia M.M. Avila J. Coll J. Colaco C. Sandoval I.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) but demonstrated to be expressed in secretory cells, rat glioma (35Koszka C. Leichtfried F.E. Wiche G. Eur. J. Cell. Biol. 1985; 38: 149-156PubMed Google Scholar), pituitary and PC12 (34Valdivia M.M. Avila J. Coll J. Colaco C. Sandoval I.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By immunoblot analysis using a polyclonal anti-MAP-2 antibody, ॆTC3 cells were demonstrated to express a high molecular weight protein (M r> 205 kDa) of electrophoretic mobility indistinguishable from MAP-2 purified from bovine brain (Fig.1 A, lane 1 versus lane 4). This MAP-2-like protein was immunoprecipitated from ॆTC3 cell homogenates by this antibody as indicated by its disappearance from ॆ-cell homogenates (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) and its appearance in protein A-sedimented immunoprecipitates (Fig.1 A, lane 3). Immunoblot analysis of this immunoprecipitate using a monoclonal anti-MAP-2 antibody confirmed the identity of this high molecular weight protein as MAP-2 (Fig.1 B, lane 2). That MAP-2 expression in ॆTC3 cells was not an artifact of ॆ-cell transformation was supported by the presence of immunoreactive immunoprecipitable MAP-2 in isolated rat islets (Fig. 1 B, lanes 3 and 4). It was noted however, that ॆTC3 cells express only a single form of MAP-2 in contrast to the characteristic doublet of MAP-2 (comprised of MAP-2A and -2B) observed in neurons (36Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and demonstrated here in islet immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). These findings, coupled to the ensuing demonstration that this high molecular weight protein was capable of being phosphorylated by kinases known to phosphorylate MAP-2 in vitro (see below), established that ॆTC3 cells express MAP-2. Despite previous inferences to the presence of MAPs in the pancreatic ॆ-cell (23Pipeleers D.G. Pipeleers-Marichal M.A. Kipnis D.M. Science. 1976; 191: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), this study is believed to be the first demonstration that these cells express MAP-2. Closer scrutiny of immunoblot analyses indicate that ॆ-cells express MAP-2 to a lower extent (by a factor of 50–60) relative to whole brain extract and therefore similar to estimates from other non-neuronal tissues (34Valdivia M.M. Avila J. Coll J. Colaco C. Sandoval I.V. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 105: 1241-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The major objective of this study was to evaluate whether MAP-2 serves as a substrate for CaM kinase II in the pancreatic ॆ-cell. Sequence analysis of brain MAP-2 has identified 13 potential phosphorylation sites for CaM kinase II based on the published consensus sequence RXX(S/T) (37Kosik K.S. Orecchio L.D. Bakalis S. Duffy L. Neve R.L. J. Neurochem. 1988; 51: 587-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). At least five of these sites have been demonstrated to be phosphorylated by this kinasein vitro (38Goldenring J.R. Vallano M.L. DeLorenzo R.J. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 900-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and a similar number of sites observed in stimulated GH3 cells in situ (9Jefferson A.B. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 346-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, MAP-2 also serves as a prominent substrate for PKA (9Jefferson A.B. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 346-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Theurkauf W.E. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 7883-7886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and other known protein kinases (40Tsuyama S. Bramblett G.T. Huang K.P. Flavin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4110-4116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to circumvent anticipated difficulties in the detection of increased phosphate incorporation into MAP-2 as the result of the activation of selective protein kinases on a high background level of basal phosphorylation (9Jefferson A.B. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 346-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ॆTC3 cells were permeabilized with α-toxin, and radiolabeled [γ-32P]ATP only introduced during incubation periods. This method of permeabilization was chosen to minimize the loss of intracellular proteins (28Ahnert-Hilger G. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 77-82Google Scholar). In the presence of 0.05 ॖm Ca2+ (to mimic the intracellular concentration of a resting ॆ-cell (41Gilon P. Nenquin M. Henquin J.-C. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar))32Pi was incorporated into MAP-2 in a time-dependent manner (Fig.2). This response likely reflected the activity of protein kinases involved in the maintenance of basal phosphorylation levels of MAP-2, which are thought to be required for the retention of protein function (14Brugg B. Matus A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). On elevation of the Ca2+ concentration to 5 ॖm (to promote the activation of CaM kinase II) the extent of 32Piincorporation into MAP-2 was significantly increased; at the optimal time of 1 min, 5 ॖm Ca2+ increased32Pi incorporation into MAP-2 by 326 ± 767 relative to time 0 and by 1637 relative to control cells incubated in the presence of 0.05 ॖm Ca2+. An autoradiogram of immunoprecipitated MAP-2 under these experimental conditions is shown in Fig. 2 A. The phosphorylation of MAP-2 was also dependent on Ca2+concentration. Thus, Ca2+ concentrations of 0.5 ॖm or greater were required to induce detectable MAP-2 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 A), and half-maximal phosphorylation was achieved at approximately 0.8 ॖm Ca2+. As demonstrated in Fig.3 B, similar Ca2+ concentrations were required to activate CaM kinase II under identical conditions. Again increases in free Ca2+ concentration beyond 0.5 ॖm were required to induce kinase activation, and half-maximal activation was achieved at approximately 1 ॖm Ca2+, consistent with the known low affinity of this enzyme for Ca2+/calmodulin relative to other Ca2+-activated kinases (42Hanson P.I. Schulman H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 559-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). The similarity of these Ca2+ dependence profiles is consistent with a functional association of Ca2+-dependent activation of CaM kinase II with the phosphorylation of ॆ-cell MAP-2 and is further substantiated by virtually identical Ca2+-dependence of CaM kinase-mediated phosphorylation of brain MAP-2 conducted in vitro (36Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The maintenance of a minimal level of cAMP is required to support glucose-induced insulin secretion from fluorescence-activated cell sorter-purified ॆ-cells (43Wang J.-L. Easom R.A. Hughes J.H. McDaniel M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 171: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 44Schuit F.C. Pipeleers D.G. Endocrinology. 1985; 117: 834-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), and other studies have localized an effect of cAMP to potentiate Ca2+-induced insulin secretion to some distal step of the secretory process (45Hughes S.J. Christie M.R. Ashcroft S.J.H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1987; 50: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Since MAP-2 may also serve as a substrate for PKA (36Schulman H. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) in the pancreatic ॆ-cell, it was important to determine to what extent Ca2+-induced phosphorylation of MAP-2 was contributed by the activation of this kinase. To this end, permeabilized cells were incubated in buffer containing 0.05 or 5 ॖm Ca2+ supplemented with forskolin (10 ॖm), a known activator of adenylate cyclase and/or H-89 (5 ॖm), a specific inhibitor of PKA (46Chijiwa T. Mishima A. Hagiwara M. Sano M. Hayashi K. Inoue T. Naito K. Toshioka T. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5267-5272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). In the presence of basal concentrations of Ca2+ (0.05 ॖm), forskolin induced a significant phosphorylation of MAP-2 (160 ± 137 relative to control, p = 0.004), which was totally abrogated by the inclusion of 5 ॖm H-89 (Fig. 4). As anticipated, forskolin had no significant effect on the activation state of CaM kinase II in these cell preparations (data not shown). In contrast, MAP-2 phosphorylation induced by stimulatory concentrations of Ca2+ (5 ॖm) was only modestly (227) reduced in the presence of H-89, an effect that was not statistically significant (p = 0.48) (Fig. 4). Accordingly, H-89 (5 ॖm) had only modest effects on CaM kinase II activity in ॆTC3 cell homogenates or on CaM kinase II-mediated phoshorylation of purified MAP-2 in vitro (∼157 inhibition in either case, data not shown). These observations demonstrate that the activation of PKA is capable of inducing MAP-2 phosphorylation in permeabilized ॆTC3 cells. This activation may contribute, although not significantly, to MAP-2 phosphorylation induced by 5 ॖmCa2+. A logical explanation is provided by the demonstrated presence in the ॆ-cell of calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase and phosphodiesterase activities that could mediate Ca2+-dependent modulations of intracellular cAMP concentrations (47Sharp G.W.G. Diabetologia. 1979; 16: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Attempts to support the hypothesis that Ca2+-induced phosphorylation of MAP-2 was mediated by CaM kinase II via the use of putative inhibitors of this enzyme, KN-93 and K252a were thwarted by observed nonspecific effects of these compounds. Although KN-93 and K252a both abolished Ca2+-induced phosphorylation of MAP-2, these compounds also significantly suppressed forskolin-induced phosphorylation of MAP-2 (data not shown). In light of the inability of forskolin to affect the activation state of CaM kinase II, it was reasoned that these effects must reflect a lack of specificity of these compounds in situ. Therefore, in the absence of selective inhibitors of CaM kinase II, specific phosphorylation sites targeted in response to Ca2+ were determined by two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide analysis. Through in vitro incubation with recombinant enzyme, six major and several minor phosphorylation sites for CaM kinase II on purified brain MAP-2 were identified (Fig.5 A), which is consistent with previous reports (9Jefferson A.B. Schulman H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 346-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although initial studies were conducted using a neuronally expressed isoform of CaM kinase II, i.e. CaM kinase IIα, similar phosphopeptide patterns were generated from MAP-2 phosphorylated by a δ2 isoform recently demonstrated to be prominently expressed in ॆ-cells (48Mohlig M. Wolter S. Mayer P. Lang J. Osterhoff M. Horn P.A. Schatz H. Pfeiffer A. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All of the major CaM kinase II sites were evident in digests made from MAP-2 that had been immunoprecipitated from ॆTC3 cells stimulated in the presence of 5 ॖm Ca2+ (Fig. 5 B, arrowheads) as verified by comigration with in vitro generated phosphopeptides (Fig. 5 C). Not only do these data suggest that structural features of neuronal MAP-2 surrounding these phosphorylation sites are equivalent in the pancreatic ॆ-cell protein but further imply that functional regulation of MAP-2 asserted by CaM kinase II-specific phosphorylation may also be conserved. Comparison of phosphopeptide digests generated from MAP-2 phosphorylated in the presence of basal (0.05 ॖm) or stimulatory (5 ॖm) Ca2+ concentrations revealed significant differences. A representative experiment is illustrated in Fig. 6. Although some variation was observed between experiments, characteristic of most analyses was a marked (780 ± 1407 over control) Ca2+-induced phosphorylation of a site central to the phosphopeptide map (Fig. 6, large open circle). Interestingly, this spot corresponded to the site most responsive toin vitro phosphorylation by purified CaM kinase II (Fig.5 A) providing compelling evidence that MAP-2 serves as a substrate for this enzyme in ॆTC3 cells. In the indicated experiment, Ca2+ induced the net phosphorylation of other sites (labeled by a small 舠o舡) that corresponded to CaM kinase II-specific sites (cf. Fig. 5 A), but significant differences in phosphate incorporation into these sites was not uniformly observed in all experiments. It is possible that these additional sites are not as readily available to the enzyme in situ relative to in vitro conditions, which suggests that they are secondary to the site described above. These data therefore demonstrate that CaM kinase II phosphorylates at least one site on MAP-2 establishing this protein as a substrate for this enzyme in the ॆ-cell. Ca2+ induced several changes in the phosphorylation of MAP-2 that cannot be ascribed to CaM kinase II. One such change was characterized by a net dephosphorylation (Fig. 6, cross symbol) implicating the action of a Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, e.g.calcineurin, as has been previously reported (49Goto S. Yamamoto H. Fukunaga K. Iwasa T. Matsukado Y. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1985; 45: 276-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 50Ferreira A. Kincaid R. Kosik K.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1225-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Ca2+also induced the phosphorylation of sites of similar migration to major sites targeted by PKA in vitro (Fig. 6, indicated by 舠p舡) that were clearly distinct from sites targeted by CaM kinase II (Fig. 7). This suggests that these may represent cAMP-induced phosphorylation events consistent with the ability of H-89 to modestly inhibit MAP-2 phosphorylation. Alternatively, they could represent sites phosphorylated by other Ca2+-sensitive protein kinases such as protein kinase C (51Easom R.A. Landt M. Colca J.R. Hughes J.H. Turk J. McDaniel M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14938-14946Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or MAP kinase (52Frodin M. Sekine N. Roche E. Filloux C. Prentki M. Wollheim C.B. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7882-7889Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). To what extent the function of MAP-2 is dependent on phosphorylation at multiple sites targeted by distinct kinases is not clear although it is likely that the site of phosphate incorporation rather than the overall amount is the critical factor for the specific regulation of MAP-2 (14Brugg B. Matus A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, because of its ability to act as a common substrate for both CaM kinase II and PKA, as well as other kinases/phosphatases, MAP-2 may provide a point of signal convergence for the integrated control of insulin secretion. A considerable body of evidence generated from the use of microtubule disrupting drugs support a role for the dynamic assembly/disassembly of microtubules in the mechanism of insulin secretion (20Somers G. Blondel B. Orci L. Malaisse W.J. Endocrinology. 1979; 104: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Lacy P.E. Walker M.M. Fink C.J. Diabetes. 1972; 21: 987-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 22Lacy P.E. Finke E.H. Codilla R.C. Lab. Invest. 1975; 33: 570-576PubMed Google Scholar, 53Farshori P.Q. Goode D. J. Submicrosc. Cytol. Pathol. 1997; 26: 137-146Google Scholar). Dark-field microscopic studies have convincingly demonstrated that secretory granules derived from pancreatic ॆ-cells physically associate with stabilized microtubules through visible link structures, which were suggested to be MAPs, although not identified (54Suprenant K.A. Dentler W.L. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 164-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of MAP-2 by CaM kinase II and PKA leads, at leastin vitro, to the increased disassembly of microtubules (19Yamamoto H. Fukunaga K. Goto S. Tanaka E. Miyamoto E. J. Neurochem. 1985; 44: 759-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) possibly through microtubule domain 舠stiffening舡 as shown for the low molecular weight MAP, tau (55Lichtenberg B. Mandelkow E.M. Hagestedt T. Mandelkow E. Nature. 1988; 334: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The site-specific phosphorylation of MAP-2 by CaM kinase II could, therefore, regulate the association of secretory granules with microtubules in the ॆ-cell and/or regulate their translocation toward the exocytotic site as a result of changes in microtubule dynamics. Indeed such a role for Ca2+-dependent kinases in granule translocation has recently been obtained from video microscopy experiments in living ॆ-cells (56Hisatomi M. Hidaka H. Niki I. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 4644-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and is consistent with recent evidence that this enzyme acts at a site proximal to granule exocytosis (3Easom R.A. Filler N.R. Ings E.I. Tarpley J. Landt M. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2359-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These pieces of evidence, combined with recent demonstrations that CaM kinase II is present in highly purified secretory granule membranes of ॆ-cell insulinoma tissue, 2R. A. Easom and C. J. Rhodes, unpublished observations. suggest that this enzyme may be perfectly poised to regulate insulin secretion via the regulation of microtubule function and its association with secretory granules.

https://openalex.org/W2116280900,"Abstract The process of moving a DNA base extrahelical (base flipping) has been shown in the co-crystal structure of a UV-induced pyrimidine dimer-specific glycosylase, T4 endonuclease V, with its substrate DNA. Compared with other enzymes known to use base flipping, endonuclease V is unique in that it moves the base opposite the target site extrahelical, rather than moving the target base itself. Utilizing substrate analogs and catalytically inactive mutants of T4 endonuclease V, this study investigates the discrete steps involved in damage recognition by this DNA repair enzyme. Specifically, fluorescence spectroscopy analysis shows that fluorescence changes attributable to base flipping are specific for only the base directly opposite either abasic site analogs or the 5′-thymine of a pyrimidine dimer, and no changes are detected if the 2-aminopurine is moved opposite the 3′-thymine of the pyrimidine dimer. Interestingly, base flipping is not detectable with every specific binding event suggesting that damage recognition can be achieved without base flipping. Thus, base flipping does not add to the stability of the specific enzyme-DNA complex but rather induces a conformational change to facilitate catalysis at the appropriate target site. When used in conjunction with structural information, these types of analyses can yield detailed mechanistic models and critical amino acid residues for extrahelical base movement as a mode of damage recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2046045770,"The BTB/POZ domain defines a conserved region of about 120 residues and has been found in over 40 proteins to date. It is located predominantly at the N terminus of Zn-finger DNA-binding proteins, where it may function as a repression domain, and less frequently in actin-binding and poxvirus-encoded proteins, where it may function as a protein-protein interaction interface. A prototypic human BTB/POZ protein, PLZF (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger) is fused to RARa (retinoic acid receptor a) in a subset of acute promyelocytic leukemias (APLs), where it acts as a potent oncogene. The exact role of the BTB/POZ domain in protein-protein interactions and/or transcriptional regulation is unknown. We have overexpressed, purified, characterized, and crystallized the BTB/POZ domain from PLZF (PLZFBTB/POZ). Gel filtration, dynamic light scattering, and equilibrium sedimentation experiments show that PLZF-BTB/POZ forms a homodimer with a Kd below 200 nM. Differential scanning calorimetry and equilibrium denaturation experiments are consistent with the PLZFBTB/POZ dimer undergoing a two-state unfolding transition with a Tm of 70.4 °C, and a DG of 12.8 6 0.4 kcal/ mol. Circular dichroism shows that the PLZF-BTB/POZ dimer has significant secondary structure including about 45% helix and 20% b-sheet. We have prepared crystals of the PLZF-BTB/POZ that are suitable for a high resolution structure determination using x-ray crystallography. The crystals form in the space group I222 or I212121 with a 5 38.8, b 5 77.7, and c 5 85.3 A and contain 1 protein subunit per asymmetric unit with approximately 40% solvent. Our data support the hypothesis that the BTB/POZ domain mediates a functionally relevant dimerization function in vivo. The crystal structure of the PLZF-BTB/POZ domain will provide a paradigm for understanding the structural basis underlying BTB/ POZ domain function."
https://openalex.org/W2058885000,"In Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942, an ATP-binding cassette transporter encoded by the genes nrtA, nrtB, nrtC, and nrtD mediates active transport of nitrate and nitrite, which is inhibited by ammonium, a preferred source of nitrogen for the cyanobacterium. One of the ATP-binding subunits of the transporter, NrtC, has a distinct C-terminal domain of 380 amino acid residues. A mutant NC2, constructed by removal of this domain using genetic engineering techniques, assimilated low concentrations of nitrate and nitrite and accumulated nitrate intracellularly, showing that the domain is not essential for the transporter activities. Assimilation of low concentrations of nitrite was only partially inhibited by ammonium in NC2 but was completely inhibited in the wild-type cells. Cells of NC2 and its derivative (nitrate reductase-less strain NC4) carrying the truncated NrtC but not the cells with the wild-type NrtC accumulated nitrate intracellularly in the presence of ammonium in medium. These findings indicated that the C-terminal domain of NrtC is involved in the ammonium-promoted inhibition of the nitrate/nitrite transporter. In the presence of ammonium, NC2 could not assimilate nitrate despite its ability to accumulate nitrate intracellularly, which suggested that reduction of intracellular nitrate by nitrate reductase is also subject to inhibition by ammonium. In Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942, an ATP-binding cassette transporter encoded by the genes nrtA, nrtB, nrtC, and nrtD mediates active transport of nitrate and nitrite, which is inhibited by ammonium, a preferred source of nitrogen for the cyanobacterium. One of the ATP-binding subunits of the transporter, NrtC, has a distinct C-terminal domain of 380 amino acid residues. A mutant NC2, constructed by removal of this domain using genetic engineering techniques, assimilated low concentrations of nitrate and nitrite and accumulated nitrate intracellularly, showing that the domain is not essential for the transporter activities. Assimilation of low concentrations of nitrite was only partially inhibited by ammonium in NC2 but was completely inhibited in the wild-type cells. Cells of NC2 and its derivative (nitrate reductase-less strain NC4) carrying the truncated NrtC but not the cells with the wild-type NrtC accumulated nitrate intracellularly in the presence of ammonium in medium. These findings indicated that the C-terminal domain of NrtC is involved in the ammonium-promoted inhibition of the nitrate/nitrite transporter. In the presence of ammonium, NC2 could not assimilate nitrate despite its ability to accumulate nitrate intracellularly, which suggested that reduction of intracellular nitrate by nitrate reductase is also subject to inhibition by ammonium. Nitrate is a major source of nitrogen for cyanobacteria (1Guerrero M.G. Vega J.M. Losada M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1981; 32: 169-204Crossref Google Scholar). It is transported into the cell by an active transport system and reduced to ammonium by the sequential action of nitrate reductase (NR) 1The abbreviations used are: NR, nitrate reductase; NiR, nitrite reductase; kbp, kilobase pair(s); Chl, chlorophyll; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography. and nitrite reductase (NiR) prior to fixation into amide nitrogen of Gln. Expression of the nitrate assimilation activity is negatively regulated by ammonium (1Guerrero M.G. Vega J.M. Losada M. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. 1981; 32: 169-204Crossref Google Scholar,2Guerrero M.G. Lara C. Fay P. Van Baalen C. The Cyanobacteria. Elsevier, Amsterdam1987: 163-186Google Scholar). In the unicellular non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteriumSynechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942, the genes encoding the nitrate transport system (nrtA, nrtB, nrtC, andnrtD) (3Omata T. Ohmori M. Arai N.

Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 1311-1320Google Scholar) form an nirA-nrtABCD-narB operon (the nirA operon), and the transcription from the operon is inhibited by the addition of ammonium to the cyanobacterial cultures (9Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 1311-1320Google Scholar). Ammonium inhibits transcription through its fixation into Gln, but Gln is not the direct regulator of transcription (9Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 1311-1320Google Scholar, 10Coronil T. Lara C. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1991; 29: 651-655Google Scholar). We have proposed that cyanate, a metabolite of Gln via carbamoylphosphate, acts as the metabolic signal for the ammonium-promoted repression of thenirA operon (11Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2688-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Nitrate assimilation by cyanobacteria is subject also to post-translational regulation, being inhibited upon addition of ammonium to the cultures (12Ohmori M. Ohmori K. Strotmann H. Arch. Microbiol. 1977; 114: 225-229Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Flores E. Guerrero M.G. Losada M. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 128: 137-144Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The major rate-limiting step of nitrate assimilation in cyanobacteria is nitrate transport into the cell (3Omata T. Ohmori M. Arai N. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6612-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Lara C. Romero J.M. Guerrero M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4376-4378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown to be inhibited by ammonium (14Lara C. Romero J.M. Guerrero M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4376-4378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,15Lara C. Rodrı́guez R. Guerrero M.G. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 582-587Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Because inhibition of glutamine synthetase byl-methionine-dl-sulfoximine abolishes the negative effect of ammonium on nitrate transport (14Lara C. Romero J.M. Guerrero M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4376-4378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fixation of ammonium to Gln is clearly required for the regulation. However, the metabolic signal leading to the inhibition of nitrate transport and the molecular mechanism of the regulation remain to be elucidated. The nitrate transport system of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 transports nitrite as well as nitrate (16Rodrı́guez R. Lara C. Guerrero M.G. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Luque I. Flores E. Herrero A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1184: 296-298Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and hence is a nitrate/nitrite transporter. The product of the nrtA gene is a 45-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein (3Omata T. Ohmori M. Arai N. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6612-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which has been shown to be a nitrate/nitrite-binding lipoprotein (18Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The deduced NrtB protein has structural similarities to the integral membrane components of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporters, and the deduced NrtC and NrtD proteins have the sequences typical of the ATP-binding components of the ABC transporters (5Omata T. Andriesse X. Hirano A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), showing that the cyanobacterial nitrate/nitrite transporter belongs to the superfamily of ABC transporters (19Higgins C.F. Hyde S.C. Mimmack M.M. Gileadi U. Gill D.R. Gallagher M.P. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1990; 22: 571-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) or traffic ATPases (20Doige C.A. Ames G.F.-L. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 291-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). NrtC is unique among the ATP-binding subunits of the ABC transporters in that it consists of two distinct domains, one of which (amino acids 1–254) is strongly similar to NrtD and the ATP-binding subunits of other ABC transporters, whereas the other (amino acids 279–659) is 307 identical in amino acid sequence to NrtA (5Omata T. Andriesse X. Hirano A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this work, we constructed and characterized deletion mutants of Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 lacking NrtC or with a truncated NrtC lacking the C-terminal domain. Measurements of nitrate and nitrite uptake from medium and of intracellular nitrate accumulation and examination of the effects of ammonium thereon showed that NrtC is an essential component of the nitrate transporter and that the C-terminal domain of NrtC is involved in the ammonium-promoted inhibition of the transporter. A derivative ofSynechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 that is cured of the resident small plasmid pUH24 (R2-SPc, Ref. 6Kuhlemeier C.J. Logtenberg T. Stoorvogel W. van Heugten H.A.A. Borrias W.E. van Arkel G.A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 36-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; hereafter designated simply as strain PCC 7942) and the mutant strains derived therefrom were grown photoautotrophically under CO2-sufficient conditions as described previously (11Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2688-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The growth temperature was 30 °C unless otherwise stated. The basal medium used was a nitrogen-free medium obtained by modification of BG11 medium (21Stanier R.Y. Kunisawa R. Mandel M. Cohen-Bazire G. Bacteriol. Rev. 1971; 35: 171-205Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described previously (11Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2688-2694Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Ammonium-, nitrite-, and nitrate-containing media were prepared by addition of 3.75 mm(NH4)2SO4, 5 mmNaNO2, and 15 mm KNO3, respectively, to the basal medium unless otherwise stated. All media were buffered with 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.2). When appropriate, kanamycin was added to the media at 25 ॖg/ml. Expression of the nitrate assimilation genes was induced by transfer of ammonium-grown cells to the nitrate- or nitrite-containing medium as described previously (9Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 1311-1320Google Scholar). Two defined mutants ofSynechococcus, NC2 and NC3, were constructed by deleting the 3′ portion of nrtC corresponding to the C-terminal domain of NrtC and the entire nrtC gene, respectively, from thenirA-nrtABCD-narB operon by the marker exchange-eviction mutagenesis method (22Ried J.L. Collmer A. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 57: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) using a 3.8-kbp nptI-sacB cartridge excised from pRL250 (23Cai Y. Wolk C.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 3138-3145Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) as the selection marker (Fig. 1 A). In NC2, a 1179-base pair internal segment of nrtC, corresponding to nucleotides 798–1976 of the 1977-nucleotide-long coding region (dotted in Fig. 1 A), had been deleted from the genome, and as a consequence of the in-frame deletion of nucleotides, the modified nrtC encoded a protein of 266 amino acid residues, consisting of the N-terminal ATP-binding domain (amino acids 1–254) and a part of the linker sequence connecting the N-terminal and C-terminal domains (amino acids 255–266) of NrtC (5Omata T. Andriesse X. Hirano A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The nrtB and nrtD coding regions in NC3 were separated by 16 nucleotides, GGAGCCCTATGAATTC, in which the first 10 bases were derived from the first 10 of the 14-base-longnrtB-nrtC intercistronic sequence and the last 6 bases were derived from the EcoRI recognition sequence that had been created by polymerase chain reaction amplification of thenrtB and nrtD fragments during the construction of the mutant. A NR-less derivative of NC2 (designated NC4) was constructed by inactivating narB according to a previously described procedure for construction of the targeted NR mutant ofSynechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (ΔnarB::kan, Ref. 24Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar; here designated NR1). Chromosomal DNAs were extracted and purified from the Synechococcus cells as described by Williams (25Williams J.G.K. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 167: 766-778Crossref Scopus (856) Google Scholar). Manipulations and analyses of DNA were performed according to standard protocols (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For Southern hybridization analysis of the genomic DNA digests, the following gene-specific probes were used (Fig. 1 A): a 0.4-kbpBamHI-XhoI fragment of nrtB (probe B), a 0.6-kbp HincII fragment of the N-terminal domain ofnrtC (probe C1), and a 0.8-kbpPstI-XhoI fragment of the C-terminal domain ofnrtC (probe C2). Total RNA was extracted and purified fromSynechococcus cells by the method of Aiba et al.(27Aiba H. Adhya S. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11905-11910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For Northern hybridization analysis, a 410-base pair polymerase chain reaction-amplified nrtD fragment was used as a probe (probe D; Fig. 1 A). A fragment of nrtC, extending from nucleotides −10 to 829 with respect to the translation start site, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen). The 14th base of the sense primer used, corresponding to the 4th base of the coding region, had been changed from C in the original nrtCsequence to G to create a NcoI recognition site at the translation start site. After verification of the nucleotide sequence, a 0.6-kbp nrtC fragment, corresponding to nucleotides −1 to 595, was excised from the plasmid by digestion with NcoI andSalI and joined with a 1.6-kbpSalI-XbaI fragment of pTO1 (5Omata T. Andriesse X. Hirano A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) carrying the rest of nrtC and the 5′ portion of nrtD between theNcoI and XbaI sites of the shuttle expression vector pSE1 (18Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid (pNRTC1) encoded a modified NrtC, in which the second amino acid residue had been changed from Ser to Ala. pNRTC1 was transformed into the NC3 mutant, and expression ofnrtC was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside. A 1.1-kbp SalI-XhoI fragment of nrtC was excised from pTO2 (5Omata T. Andriesse X. Hirano A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and cloned in theSalI site in the polylinker of the expression vector pQE-31 (Qiagen). The resulting plasmid carried a chimeric gene encoding a truncated NrtC (amino acids 199–569) fused to an N-terminal amino acid segment carrying six consecutive His residues. The plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli M15 [pREP4] (Qiagen), and expression of the chimeric gene was induced by 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside. The histidine-tagged protein was purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (28Hochuli E. Döbeli H. Schacher A. J. Chromatogr. 1987; 411: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (980) Google Scholar) and used for raising antibodies in mice. Immunoblotting analysis of the cytoplasmic membrane samples prepared from Synechococcus cells was performed as described previously (18Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), using the antiserum against the NrtC polypeptide. Uptake of nitrate and nitrite by nitrate (20 mm)-grownSynechococcus cells was measured at 30 °C in the light by following the changes in concentrations of nitrate and nitrite, respectively, in the medium as described previously (18Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), except that the pH of the assay medium was 8.2 for the measurement of nitrate uptake; nitrite uptake was measured at 9.6 as in the previous study (18Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) so that passive diffusion of nitrous acid (HNO2) into the cells is negligible (29Flores E. Herrero A. Guerrero M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 896: 103-108Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Synechococcus cells were grown at 40 °C with ammonium as the nitrogen source. Nitrate transport activity was induced by transfer of the ammonium-grown cells to nitrite-containing medium followed by incubation under the growth conditions for 15 h. Accumulation of intracellular nitrate was measured at 40 °C in the light in the presence of 20 ॖm KNO3 and 10 mm NaHCO3, using the silicone oil filtering centrifugation technique and HPLC determination of nitrate as described previously (16Rodrı́guez R. Lara C. Guerrero M.G. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). NR and NiR activities were determined at 30 °C, using toluene-permeabilized cells with dithionite-reduced methylviologen as the electron donor (30Herrero A. Flores E. Guerrero M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1981; 145: 175-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Herrero A. Guerrero M.G. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1986; 132: 2463-2468Google Scholar). Nitrate and nitrite were determined with a flow injection analyzer (NOX-1000W, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.). Ammonium was determined as described by Anderson and Little (32Anderson P.M. Little R.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1621-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll and protein were determined according to Mackinney (33Mackinney G. J. Biol. Chem. 1941; 140: 315-322Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) and Lowry et al. (34Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. In Southern hybridization analysis of the BamHI-XbaI digest of genomic DNA from the wild-type strain, the nrtB-specific probe hybridized with a 3.0-kbp DNA fragment (Fig.1 B, lane 1), which was recognized also by the probes specific to the 5′ portion (Fig.1 B, lane 4) and the 3′ portion (Fig.1 B, lane 7) of nrtC, as expected from the restriction map of the nirA operon (Fig. 1 A). With the nrtB-specific probe, the hybridizing band in the digest of NC2 DNA was located at 1.6 kbp (Fig. 1 B,lane 2), which was recognized by the probe specific to the 5′ portion of nrtC (Fig. 1 B, lane 5) but not by the probe specific to the 3′ portion of nrtC(Fig. 1 B, lane 8), indicating that the 3′ portion of nrtC had been deleted from the genome of NC2. In the digest of NC3 DNA, the band hybridizing to the nrtB-specific probe was located at 0.7 kbp (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). The 0.7-kbp band hybridized with neither of the nrtC probes (Fig. 1 B, lanes 6 and 9), indicating that the entire nrtC gene had been deleted from the genome of NC3. As described previously (9Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 1311-1320Google Scholar), transfer of ammonium-grown wild-type cells to nitrate-containing medium induced accumulation of the nirA operon transcript, which hybridized with a probe specific to nrtD, the gene located downstream ofnrtC (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). The size of the hybridization signal ranged from 0.25 to >7 kilobases representing rapid degradation of thenirA operon transcript (9Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 1311-1320Google Scholar). The NC2 and NC3 mutants also accumulated the transcripts hybridizing with thenrtD-specific probe when transferred to nitrate-containing medium (Fig. 2, lanes 3–6), showing that nrtD is transcribed in the mutants under the regulation of the nirAoperon promoter as in the wild-type strain. In the mutants as well as in the wild-type strain, the NR and NiR activities were induced by transfer of the cells from ammonium-containing medium to nitrate-containing medium (TableI). Because NR and NiR are encoded by the last (narB) and the first (nirA) genes of thenirA operon, respectively, the truncation of nrtCor its deletion from the nirA operon did not essentially affect the expression of the other genes in the operon. However, the NR activity in NC2 was about 507 of the wild-type level (Table I) for an unknown reason. Because the growth rate of NC2 in nitrate-containing medium was similar to that of the wild-type strain and because the rate of nitrate utilization by NC2 cells was comparable with that by the wild-type cells (see below), it was unlikely that the low NR activity was limiting nitrate assimilation in NC2.Table INR and NiR activities in ammonium- and nitrate-grown cells of the wild-type and mutant strainsStrainNR activityNiR activityNH4+NO3−NH4+NO3−ॖmol mg −1 Chl h −1WT17 (15–20)259 (250–268)10 (9–11)47 (41–58)NC219 (17–23)129 (126–131)11 (9–14)82 (83–87)NC311 (9–13)258 (254–263)9 (6–11)98 (97–99)Ammonium-grown cells of wild-type Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (WT) and the mutants NC2 and NC3 were transferred to nitrate (15 mm)-containing medium, and the enzyme activities were assayed before and 16 h after the transfer. The values are the averages from three measurements, and those in the parentheses show the ranges. Open table in a new tab Ammonium-grown cells of wild-type Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (WT) and the mutants NC2 and NC3 were transferred to nitrate (15 mm)-containing medium, and the enzyme activities were assayed before and 16 h after the transfer. The values are the averages from three measurements, and those in the parentheses show the ranges. In immunoblotting analysis, the antibody against the NrtC polypeptide reacted with three polypeptides having apparent molecular masses of 67, 55, and 45 kDa, respectively, in the cytoplasmic membrane from nitrate-grown wild-type cells (Fig. 3, lane 2). The faint 55-kDa band was observed in the membrane preparations from ammonium-grown cells as well (Fig. 3, lane 1) and was ascribed to nonspecific binding of the antibody to a cytoplasmic membrane protein. Of the two bands specific to nitrate-grown cells, the 45-kDa band was probably due to NrtA, which is 307 identical in amino acid sequence to the C-terminal portion of NrtC and is the most abundant protein in the cytoplasmic membrane of nitrate-grown cells (3Omata T. Ohmori M. Arai N. Ogawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6612-6616Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 67-kDa polypeptide was identified as the product of thenrtC gene, because its apparent molecular mass was similar to the calculated molecular mass of NrtC (72 kDa). The cytoplasmic membrane preparations from nitrate-grown NC2 lacked the 67-kDa polypeptide corresponding to NrtC but had a 34-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide (Fig. 3, lane 4), which was absent in the wild-type cells (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2) and ammonium-grown NC2 cells (Fig. 3, lane 3). Because its apparent molecular mass was similar to the deduced molecular mass of the protein encoded by the truncated nrtC (29 kDa), we identified the 34-kDa polypeptide as the truncated NrtC lacking the C-terminal domain. These findings confirmed the expression of the N-terminal portion of NrtC and its incorporation into the cytoplasmic membrane in NC2. In accordance with its genome structure, NC3 showed neither the 67- nor the 34-kDa immunoreactive polypeptide (not shown). In a medium containing 2 mm nitrate as the nitrogen source, NC2 grew as rapidly as the wild-type strain, whereas NC3 grew only poorly (Fig. 4 A). The cell suspensions of the wild-type strain and NC2 (5 ॖg Chl/ml) used 120 ॖm of nitrate until its exhaustion in 30 min, whereas the NC3 cells could not utilize the low concentration of nitrate (Fig.4 B). These findings indicated that NC2 is capable of active transport of nitrate but NC3 is not. A derivative of NC3 carrying plasmid-borne nrtC (designated NC31) utilized nitrate until its exhaustion (Fig. 4 B), indicating that NrtC itself is essential for nitrate transport. The ability of NC2, having the truncated NrtC, to transport nitrate therefore indicated that the N-terminal ATP-binding domain of NrtC but not the C-terminal domain is essential for the activity of the transporter. NC2 assimilated low concentrations of nitrite as effectively as the wild-type strain (Fig. 5, Aand B). As previously reported in a closely related species of Synechococcus (strain PCC 6301, formerly Anacystis nidulans) (29Flores E. Herrero A. Guerrero M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 896: 103-108Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), nitrite uptake by the wild-type PCC 7942 cells was inhibited by the addition of ammonium to the medium (Fig.5 A) and resumed after consumption of the ammonium in the medium (data not shown). By contrast, nitrite utilization by NC2 was only partially inhibited by ammonium (Fig. 5 B). Although the nitrite uptake rate was reduced by 607 by ammonium, the cells utilized nitrite and ammonium simultaneously and eventually used up nitrite in the presence of ammonium (Fig. 5 B). A nitrite-specific transporter was recently found in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (18Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, it cannot account for the nitrite uptake by NC2 in the presence of ammonium, because the transporter is expressed only under stress of nitrogen deficiency and is subject to ammonium inhibition. 2M. Okamura, S. Maeda, M. Kobayashi, and T. Omata, unpublished results. The findings showed that nitrite is transported into NC2 cells by the nitrate/nitrite transporter in the presence of ammonium. As previously reported in other strains of cyanobacteria (12Ohmori M. Ohmori K. Strotmann H. Arch. Microbiol. 1977; 114: 225-229Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Flores E. Guerrero M.G. Losada M. Arch. Microbiol. 1980; 128: 137-144Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar), nitrate utilization by the wild-type PCC 7942 strain was inhibited by ammonium and resumed after depletion of ammonium from the medium (Fig.5 C). Unlike nitrite uptake, nitrate uptake by NC2 was completely and reversibly inhibited by ammonium (Fig. 5 D) as in the wild-type strain. Uptake of nitrate, as measured by following the nitrate concentration in medium, includes jointly transport and reduction. To determine specifically nitrate transport activity, intracellular nitrate accumulation in the light was measured in the NR-deficient mutants NR1 (24Suzuki I. Sugiyama T. Omata T. Plant Physiol. 1995; 107: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and NC4, which were constructed from the wild-type strain and NC2, respectively. As observed previously in a mutant of strain PCC 7942 with no appreciable NR activity (15Lara C. Rodrı́guez R. Guerrero M.G. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 582-587Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), NR1 accumulated about 1.5 mm of nitrate intracellularly at 20 ॖm external nitrate concentration in the absence of ammonium but did not accumulate nitrate in the presence of ammonium (Fig. 6 A). The targeted NR mutant with truncated nrtC, NC4, accumulated nitrate to a concentration similar to that observed in NR1 in the absence of ammonium and, unlike the NR1 mutant having wild-type nrtC, accumulated nitrate in the presence of ammonium as well, although the initial rate of nitrate accumulation and the final intracellular nitrate concentration were reduced by 607 by ammonium (Fig.6 B). These findings showed that nitrate is actively transported into NC4 cells in the presence of ammonium. Cyanobacterial cells with functional NR reduce intracellular nitrate in the light and usually accumulate only low concentration of nitrate (20–30 ॖm) (14Lara C. Romero J.M. Guerrero M.G. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4376-4378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NC2 cells, however, accumulated nitrate under illumination to a concentration as high as 1 mm in the absence of ammonium (Fig. 6 C), although the intracellular nitrate was subsequently depleted presumably due to reduction by NR (Fig. 6 C). Similar to NC4, NC2 accumulated nitrate in the presence of ammonium, showing no depletion of the intracellular nitrate (Fig. 6 C). The maintenance of intracellular nitrate accumulation in NC2 cells in the presence of ammonium but not in its absence suggested inhibition by ammonium of NR activity, in accordance with the complete inhibition by ammonium of nitrate uptake in NC2 (Fig. 5 D). In NC2, the uptake of nitrite from the medium proceeded in the presence of ammonium (Fig. 5 B), suggesting that the nitrate/nitrite transporter of NC2 is much less susceptible to ammonium than the wild-type transporter. This, however, apparently contradicted with the complete inhibition by ammonium of nitrate uptake by the mutant (Fig. 5 D). Direct measurements of intracellular nitrate concentration, performed by HPLC determination of nitrate in acid lysates of the cell (16Rodrı́guez R. Lara C. Guerrero M.G. Biochem. J. 1992; 282: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), showed that NC2 and its NR-less derivative (NC4) accumulate high concentrations of nitrate intracellularly in the presence of ammonium (Figs. 6, B andC). These findings indicate the functioning of the nitrate/nitrite transporter with truncated NrtC in the presence of ammonium and hence the involvement of the C-terminal domain of NrtC in the ammonium-promoted inhibition of the transporter. The inability of NC2 to assimilate nitrate in the presence of ammonium (Fig.5 D), despite its ability to accumulate nitrate intracellularly (Fig. 6 C), suggests that the reduction of intracellular nitrate by NR is also inhibited by ammonium. Nitrite has been recently found to activate transcription of the nitrate assimilation operon in Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 7942 (35Kikuchi H. Aichi M. Suzuki I. Omata T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5822-5825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The simultaneous inhibition by ammonium of nitrate/nitrite transport and nitrate reduction would contribute to negative regulation of the nitrate assimilation operon by the mechanism of inducer exclusion. The molecular mechanism of the regulation of the nitrate/nitrite transporting activity by the C-terminal domain of NrtC remains to be elucidated. In Synechococcus sp. strain PCC 6301, a plasma membrane protein kinase activity has been shown to be rapidly inactivated, whereas a soluble phosphatase activity is activated, after exposure of the cells to ammonium (36Rodrı́guez R. Garcı́a-Gonzàlez M. Guerrero M.G. Lara C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because the ammonium-sensitive protein kinase activity has been shown to phosphorylate several cytoplasmic membrane proteins including those comigrating with NrtA and NrtD (36Rodrı́guez R. Garcı́a-Gonzàlez M. Guerrero M.G. Lara C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), the regulation of nitrate transport may involve phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the transporter. The C-terminal domain of NrtC may act as a sensor of the dephosphorylation cascade triggered by ammonium or may interact specifically with the other parts of the dephosphorylated transporter to inhibit the transport. On the other hand, the similarity of the C-terminal domain of NrtC in amino acid sequence to NrtA (5Omata T. Andriesse X. Hirano A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 236: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), which has been shown to be a nitrate/nitrite-binding protein (18Maeda S. Omata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3036-3041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggests that the C-terminal domain of NrtC may be an effector-binding domain. Because the maltose transporter of E. coli is inhibited by a proteinaceous effector binding to the C-terminal extension of its ATP-binding subunit (37Dean D.A. Reizer J. Nikaido H. Saier Jr., M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21005-21010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Kühnau S. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Shuman H.A. Boos W. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2180-2186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the regulation of the cyanobacterial nitrate transporter might also involve a proteinaceous effector. Genetic and biochemical studies are being performed to clarify the molecular mechanism of the regulation of nitrate/nitrite transport by the C-terminal domain of the ATP-binding subunit."

In addition, we report that free histone H1, although not acetylated in vivo, is a preferred and convenient in vitro substrate for the study of PCAF, human GCN5, and possibly other type A histone acetyltransferases. Using either histone H1 or histone H3 as substrates, we find that preincubation with either acetyl-CoA or CoA stabilizes the acetyltransferase activities of PCAF, human GCN5 and an enzymatically active PCAF deletion mutant containing the C-terminal half of the protein. The stabilization requires the continuous presence of coenzyme, suggesting that the acetyltransferase-coenzyme complexes are stable, while the isolated apoenzymes are not. Human GCN5 and the N-terminal deletion mutant of PCAF are stabilized equally well by preincubation with either CoA or acetyl-CoA, while intact PCAF is better stabilized by acetyl-CoA than by CoA. Intact PCAF, but not the N-terminal truncation mutant or human GCN5, is autoacetylated. These findings raise the possibility that the intracellular concentrations of the coenzymes affect the stability and therefore the nuclear activity of these acetyltransferases.

Post-translational modification of chromosomal proteins, in particular the specific acetylation of histones, is correlated with various nuclear activities such as replication, chromatin assembly, and transcription (1Allfrey V.G.

The acetylation state of specific lysine residues in the evolutionarily conserved tails of the core histones can alter the interaction between these histones and the DNA and perhaps also the interactions between the histone tail domains in adjacent nucleosomes. These interactions affect the state of chromatin compaction and therefore may be involved in regulating access to the underlying DNA sequence. Increased histone acetylation promotes chromatin decompaction (11Lee D.Y. Hayes J.J. Pruss D. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 73-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (966) Google Scholar) and is associated with gene activation, while loss of acetate from histone tails is associated with gene silencing (12Braunstein M. Rose A.B. Holmes S.G. Allis C.D. Broach J.R. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). For example, in the inactive X chromosome of female human cells the core histones are underacetylated, while in the active X chromosome the histones are acetylated (13Belyaev N.D. Keohane A.M. Turner B.M. Hum. Genet. 1996; 97: 573-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The recent isolation and characterization of several enzymes involved in the acetylation and deacetylation of specific histone residues provide additional insights into the possible relation between histone acetylation and gene activation (8Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y.

Cell. 1966; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). The Tetrahymenahistone acetyltransferase is homologous to the yeast protein GCN5, which is a putative transcription activator and contains intrinsic acetyltransferase activity (8Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that human PCAF, a protein that competes with oncoprotein E1A for binding to the gene products of the p300/CBP and retinoblastoma gene families, has intrinsic acetyltransferase activity and is in part homologous to GCN5 protein. More recently, Ogryzko et al. demonstrated that the P300 protein has intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (15Ogryzko V.V. Sciltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1966; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that some transcription activators may be able to acetylate histone tails, thereby disrupting the nucleosomal structure and promoting transcription from chromatin templates. Although the genes coding for PCAF and GCN5 have been characterized and recombinant proteins have been produced in several systems, the enzymatic properties of these enzymes have not been extensively studied. In this article, we report that human GCN5, the catalytic subunit of a type A nuclear histone acetyltransferase (14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 16Brownell J.E. Zhou J. Ranalli T. Kobayashi R. Edmonston D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Cell. 1996; 84: 843-851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar), and PCAF, a histone acetyltransferase containing a domain that is highly homologous to the human GCN5 (14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), are highly unstable enzymes that rapidly and irreversibly lose histone acetyltransferase activity. We demonstrate that histone acetyltransferase activity is stabilized by the continuous presence of the coenzymes acetyl-CoA or CoA and that PCAF, but not hGCN5 1The abbreviations used are: hGCN5, human GCN5; PCA, perchloric acid. is autoacetylated, a modification that may further stabilize this enzyme. In addition, we demonstrate that both PCAF and hGCN5 catalyze the transfer of acetyl groups into free but not chromatin-bound histone H1. These results provide new information on the properties of these histone acetyltransferases and are pertinent to studies on the cellular function and mechanism of action of these, and perhaps other, histone acetyltransferases. Recombinant human GCN5 and PCAF were prepared as described previously (14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Mutant PCAF having an internal deletion of amino acid residues 61–465 (see Ref. 14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) and containing the Flag tag (Kodak) was expressed and purified by the same approach as described for the intact PCAF (14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Histone H1 was extracted from calf thymus with 57 trichloroacetic acid and purified by chromatography on Amberlite IRC-50 (17Bustin M. Nat. New Biol. 1973; 245: 207-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Histone H3 was extracted from calf thymus with 0.1 m HCl, oxidized, and purified on Sephadex G-100 (18Marzluff Jr., W.F. Sanders L.A. Miller D.M. McCarty K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2026-2033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chromosomal protein HMG-1 was isolated from calf thymus by extraction with 0.35 m NaCl and purified by ion exchange chromatography (19Romani M. Rodman T.C. Vidali G. Bustin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2918-2922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lysozyme, cytochrome c, acetyl-CoA, and CoA were obtained from Sigma. [1-14C]acetyl-CoA (55 mCi/mmol) was obtained from New England Nuclear, and [3H]acetate was obtained from ICN. All assays were performed in Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 107 glycerol (v/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmEDTA, 10 mm butyric acid) (20Brownell J.E. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6364-6368Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Substrate concentrations were 0.1–0.25 mg/ml and [1-14C]acetyl-CoA concentrations were at 9 ॖm (unless otherwise indicated). The assay was performed at 37 °C and initiated by addition of the protein substrate to a mixture containing the acetyltransferase and acetyl-CoA in buffer A. The radioactivity incorporated into the protein substrates was detected by either a filter, or a polyacrylamide gel assay. For the filter assay the reaction was stopped at given times by spotting onto filter papers (Whatman P81), which were then washed and counted as described previously (21Horiuchi K. Fujimoto D. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 69: 491-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the polyacrylamide gel assays, the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of an SDS-gel sample buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 200 mmdithiothreitol, 27 SDS, 0.17 bromphenol blue, 207 glycerol), boiled for 5 min, and loaded onto either a 10 or 157 polyacrylamide-SDS gel (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) and electrophoresed at 15 V/cm until the bromphenol blue reached the bottom of the gel. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue for estimation of protein quantities and then soaked in Enlightening Enhancer solution (Dupont) for 30 min and vacuum dried; the radioactivity incorporated into the protein bands was then visualized and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using Imagequant software. Acetylation of H1 in the presence of DNA was performed with DNA isolated from mononucleosomes (average length, 200 base pairs). The ratio was adjusted to 1 molecule of H1 per 200 base pairs of DNA. Estimates of the K m and V maxof PCAF for H1 were determined using Lineweaver-Burk plots. The kinetic parameters were estimated for enzyme that had been preincubated with or without acetyl-CoA (9 ॖm) for 10 min at 37 °C. The concentration of histone H1 was varied from 0.02 to 2 mg/ml. The enzymatic reactions were initiated by the addition of the protein substrate and sufficient acetyl-CoA to bring its final concentration to 18 ॖm. HeLa cells were grown in suspension in minimal Eagle's medium. Exponentially growing cells (200 ml, 5.0 × 105 cells/ml) were concentrated by centrifugation. The cells were resuspended in 8 ml of medium containing 200 ॖg/ml of cycloheximide (Sigma) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. After the incubation, one culture was brought to 0.5 ॖmtrichostatin A (WAKO), and 2 mCi of [3H]acetate (5 Ci/mmol, ICN) was added; the second culture was treated identically except no trichostatin A was added. The labeling was performed for 1 h at 37 °C with gentle rocking. Each culture was split into two, and the cells were harvested by centrifugation. One set of cells from each treatment was extracted with 57 perchloric acid (PCA) and precipitated with 6 volumes of acetone to measure incorporation into H1, and the second set was extracted with 0.25 m sulfuric acid and precipitated with 6 volumes of acetone to measure incorporation into the core histones. The incorporation of [3H]acetate into the given protein was measured by resolving the proteins on a 157 SDS/PAGE, staining the gel with Coomassie Blue to estimate the amount of each protein, and then excising the protein bands from the gel. The excised bands were digested at 65 °C overnight with 307 hydrogen peroxide, and the [3H]acetate incorporation into each band was determined by scintillation counting. Mouse thymus nuclei were isolated by homogenization and sedimentation in sucrose as described previously (23Garrard W.T. Hancock R. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 27-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The nuclei (3 mg/ml in DNA) were mildly digested with micrococcal nuclease (100 units/ml, 5 min at 37 °C; Boehringer Mannheim). The digested nuclei were harvested and extracted in 0.25 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 12–507 sucrose gradient containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm NaCl. After 20 h of centrifugation at 28,000 rpm (Beckman rotor, SW28), the gradient was fractionated, and the DNA in each fraction was analyzed using agarose gels. The fractions corresponding to oligonucleosome lengths of 4–10 nucleosomes were pooled, dialyzed to remove the sucrose, and concentrated by centrifugation dialysis (Filtron). PCAF and hGCN5, two related human histone acetyltransferases (14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar), exhibit identical substrate preferences (Fig. 1). In addition to the previously documented acetylation of both free and nucleosomal bound histone H3 (14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 24Kuo M.H. Brownell J.E. Sobel R.E. Ranalli T.A. Cook R.G. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Allis C.D. Nature. 1996; 383: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar), the linker histone H1 is also an excellent substrate for both enzymes. Quantitative analysis indicates that both PCAF and hGCN5 acetylate histone H1 2-fold more efficiently than histone H3 (see also Fig. 3). The acetylation of histone H1 is specific since other positively charged proteins containing numerous lysine residues (lysozyme, cytochrome c, HMG-1, nucleosomal histones H2A and H2B), similar to histone H1, were not substrates for either acetyltransferase (Fig. 1).Figure 3Loss of acetyltransferase activity in PCAF. PCAF was preincubated in either the presence (lanes 1–3) or absence (lanes 4-6) of acetyl-CoA for 10 min prior to the addition of histone H1 (lanes 1, 4,and 7), histone H3 (lanes 2, 5, and8), or nucleosome (Nuc.) cores (lanes 3, 6,and 9) as substrates.

Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). Since our studies suggested that H1 is an excellent substrate for human histone acetyltransferases, we reexamined whether histone H1 is acetylated in HeLa cells. The incorporation of [3H]acetate into histones was determined in the presence or absence of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (trichostatin A) after treatment of the cells with cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis. Quantitation of the specific radioactivity of each histone showed that the specific activity of histone H1 was <57 of that of histone H4 (Table I). Trichostatin A increased the level of acetylation of the core histones but not that of histone H1. Thus, our results are in agreement with previous findings (2van Holde K.E. Chromatin. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar) which indicated that in vivo, histone H1 is not acetylated post-translationally.Table IHistone H1 is not acetylated post-translationally: normalized specific activity of the radioactivity incorporated into histones in trichostatin A-treated HeLa cellsProteinSpecific activity7Histone H4100Histone H367Histone H2B51Histone H2A33Histone H1<3The specific activity of a histone was determined by dividing the number of counts obtained from scintillation counting of a histone band excised from a polyacrylamide gel by the intensity of the band as determined by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel.

The specific activity of the histones was normalized to that of histone H4, the value of which was taken as 1007. Open table in a new tab The specific activity of a histone was determined by dividing the number of counts obtained from scintillation counting of a histone band excised from a polyacrylamide gel by the intensity of the band as determined by densitometric analysis of the Coomassie Blue-stained gel. The intensity of the stain was within linear range and, as expected, the 4 core histones were present in equimolar rations. The specific activity of the histones was normalized to that of histone H4, the value of which was taken as 1007. To explain the apparent discrepancy between the in vivo andin vitro acetylation of H1, we examined the ability of PCAF to acetylate H1 in the presence of DNA or in the context of purified oligonucleosomes containing endogenously bound H1. Fig.2 shows that purified histone H1 either from calf or mouse thymus is efficiently acetylated by PCAF. However, acetylation of H1 is completely abolished either by addition of DNA or in the context of oligonucleosomes. In contrast, histone H3 in oligonucleosomes was well acetylated, indicating that the enzyme was active and can acetylate its substrates in chromatin. These results indicate that the nucleosome-bound form of histone H1 is not a substrate for PCAF. During these studies, we noted that in the absence of acetyl-CoA, the acetylation activity of PCAF was rapidly lost (Fig.3). In these assays, the enzyme was preincubated in the buffer used for acetylation in either the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA prior to activity measurements using histone H1, histone H3, or nucleosome cores as substrates. After 10 min of preincubation in the absence of coenzyme, the amount of radioactivity incorporated into substrates is 5–15-fold lower than that incorporated with preincubation in the presence of coenzyme. Examination of the time course of inactivation (Fig. 4) revealed that 2 min of preincubation in the absence of acetyl-CoA resulted in a 507 loss of enzymatic activity. In contrast, no loss of enzymatic activity could be detected after 10 min of preincubation in the presence of acetyl-CoA (Fig. 4). Analysis of the initial rate of acetylation at various histone H1 concentrations indicated that after 10 min of preincubation in the absence of acetyl-CoA, theV max of PCAF was 2.38 pmol of acetyl/ॖg of enzyme/min, while the V max of the enzyme after 10 min of preincubation in the presence of the coenzyme was 27.0 pmol of acetyl/ॖg of enzyme/min, i.e. 10-fold higher. TheK m of the enzyme was not appreciably affected by preincubation with the coenzyme. A possible explanation for the rapid loss of acetyltransferase activity by PCAF is proteolytic degradation during preincubation in the absence of acetyl-CoA. Conceivably, the presence of acetyl-CoA protects PCAF from proteolytic degradation. We used polyacrylamide gels to estimate the amount of PCAF protein present after 10 min of preincubation in either the presence or absence of radioactive acetyl-CoA. The amount of PCAF protein, as determined by the intensity of the Coomassie Blue band corresponding to the M r 83,000 protein (14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) did not diminish under either condition (Fig.5). After a 10-min preincubation in the absence of acetyl-CoA, the self-acetylating activity of the enzyme was lost, and subsequent addition of radioactive [1-14C]acetyl-CoA to this PCAF preparation did not result in autoacetylation (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, in the presence of acetyl-CoA, a significant amount of radioactivity was incorporated into PCAF (Fig. 5 A). We conclude that in the absence of acetyl-CoA the acetylation activity of PCAF is rapidly and irreversibly lost and that this loss is not a result of degradation of the enzyme. These results and the kinetic analysis suggest that in the absence of coenzyme PCAF is irreversibly inactivated. Because the amino acid sequence of C-terminal half of PCAF is 867 homologous to the human GCN5 (14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) and the two proteins have identical acetyltransferase substrate specificity (Fig. 1), we tested whether preincubation with acetyl-CoA also protects hGCN5 from inactivation. In these experiments, the enzyme was preincubated in either the presence or absence of acetyl-CoA before to the addition of the histone substrate. The results indicate that in the absence of the coenzyme the ability of hGCN5 to incorporate acetyl groups into histone H1 or histone H3 is rapidly lost, suggesting that this enzyme undergoes a rapid inactivation in a manner indistinguishable from that of PCAF. As with PCAF, within 10 min of preincubation without the substrate, theV max of hGCN5 decreased 5-fold, from 12.4 pmol of acetyl/ॖg of enzyme/min for the enzyme incubated in the presence of coenzyme to 2.5 pmol of acetyl/ॖg of enzyme/min for the enzyme incubated in the absence of the coenzyme. The K m was not changed significantly. To better understand the factors associated with the stabilization, we examined the ability of both CoA and acetyl-CoA to stabilize the activity of PCAF, hGCN5, and an N-terminal truncation mutant of PCAF. The N-terminal truncation mutant of PCAF contains an internal deletion of amino acids 61–465 and retains the domain that is homologous to the human and yeast GCN5 (14Yang X.-J. Ogrryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar) and is competent in both histone H1 and histone H3 acetylation. We tested whether the continuous presence of the coenzyme is required for stabilization. In the experiments depicted in Fig.6, we incubated the intact enzyme, the N-terminal truncation mutant of PCAF, and hGCN5 for 5 min either with or without acetyl-CoA or CoA. After incubation, the unbound coenzyme was removed using a spun column (G50-Probequant column (Pharmacia)), and the enzymes were again incubated for various times in the absence of additional coenzymes prior to determination of acetyltransferase activity. The results (Fig. 6) indicate that both acetyl-CoA and CoA protect all three recombinant enzymes from inactivation albeit to differing degrees (2–10-fold). After removal of the unbound coenzymes, all three acetyltransferases exhibited a gradual decline in activity. This suggests that the stabilization is mediated by bound coenzyme and not a coenzyme-mediated modification of the structure of the enzymes. Acetyl-CoA stabilized hGCN5 and the N-terminal truncation mutant to the same extent as CoA (Fig. 6, B and C). However, with full-length PCAF, the enzymatic activity was stabilized by acetyl-CoA better than by CoA (6-fold above control and 2-fold above control, respectively), indicating that the presence of the N-terminal domain confers this preferential stabilization by acetyl-CoA. During these studies, we noted that PCAF incorporated counts during its preincubation with [1-14C]acetyl-CoA, raising the possibility that PCAF is autoacetylated. The incorporation of counts into PCAF could result from a catalytic intermediate formed at the active site of the enzyme, or alternatively, from a covalent modification. To distinguish between these possibilities, we tested whether the radioactivity incorporated into PCAF by a 10-min incubation with [1-14C]acetyl-CoA could be chased by either unlabeled acetyl-CoA, histone H1, or a mixture of both unlabeled acetyl-CoA and histone H1. As indicated by the data presented in Fig.7, neither the addition of unlabeled acetyl-CoA nor the addition of unlabeled acetyl-CoA in conjunction with substrate affected the amount of 14C incorporated into the enzyme. Throughout these experiments, the acetyltransferase activity of PCAF was not diminished. Neither hGCN5 nor the N-terminal truncated PCAF mutant incorporates counts during incubation with acetyl-CoA, suggesting that the modification occurs in the N-terminal region of PCAF. In fact, a C-terminal truncated PCAF containing only the N terminal half of PCAF is devoid of intrinsic acetyltransferase activity yet can be acetylated by full-length PCAF. 2X.-J. Yang and Y. Nakatani, unpublished data. These results suggest that the autoacetylation of PCAF occurs by an intermolecular reaction in its N-terminal domain. The N terminus is required for PCAF to distinguish, with regard to stability, between acetyl-CoA and CoA. It is conceivable that autoacetylation may play a role responding to the ratio of CoA to acetyl-CoA, providing a potential means of regulating the enzymatic activity. In summary, our experiments demonstrate that the human acetyltransferases PCAF and GCN5 are unstable enzymes that are rapidly and irreversibly inactivated. The enzymes are stable in the presence of their coenzymes. The stabilization appears to be mediated by binding of the coenzyme, suggesting that the stable species is an enzyme-coenzyme complex. Based on these findings, it is tempting to speculate that the intracellular activity of these enzymes may be regulated in part by the intracellular levels of these coenzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1963558018,"The AsiA protein of bacteriophage T4 binds to the ς70 subunit of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and plays a dual regulatory role during T4 development: (i) inhibition of host and phage early transcription, and (ii) coactivation of phage middle-mode transcription, which also requires the T4 DNA binding transcriptional activator, MotA. We report that the interaction between AsiA and ς70 occurs with a 1:1 stoichiometry. When preincubated with RNA polymerase, AsiA is a potent inhibitor of open complex formation at the lac UV5 promoter, whereas it does not perturb preformed open or intermediate promoter complexes. DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift analyses of RNA polymerase-DNA complexes formed at the T4 early promoter P15.0 show that AsiA blocks the initial RNA polymerase binding step that leads to the formation of specific closed promoter complexes. A contrasting result is obtained on the T4 middle promoter PrIIB2, where AsiA stimulates the formation of both closed complexes and open complexes. Therefore, we propose that AsiA modulates initial DNA binding by the RNA polymerase, switching promoter usage at the level of closed complex formation.

Bacteriophage T4 development in Escherichia coli is regulated mainly at the transcriptional level. A number of phage-encoded transcription factors modify both the structure and the function of the host RNA polymerase (RNAP), 1The abbreviations used are: RNAP, RNA polymerase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; bp, base pair(s); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DTT, dithiothreitol. which is responsible for the transcription of all T4 genes. These RNAP modifications result in the sequential utilization of the three classes of T4 promoters: early, middle, and late (1Mosig G. Hall D.H. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1994: 127-131Google Scholar). Early promoters are transcribed immediately upon infection by unmodified host RNAP, which recognizes their bacterial-like promoter elements situated at −10 and −35 relative to the transcription start site (2Wilkens K. Rüger W. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1994: 132-141Google Scholar). Shortly thereafter, the α subunits of the RNAP are ADP-ribosylated by two phage-encoded proteins, Alt and Mod, and the RNAP is tightly bound by the products of T4 genes rpbA and asiA (3Stitt B. Hinton D. Karam J.D. Molecular Biology of Bacteriophage T4. ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1994: 142-160Google Scholar). Middle promoters contain an E. coli-like −10 consensus sequence, but lack an identifiable −35 region. This is replaced by a 舠Mot box舡 ((t/a)(t/a)TGCTT(t/c)A), a 9-bp sequence centered around −30, which is the binding site for the T4 transcriptional activator MotA (3Stitt B. Hinton D. Karam J.D.

Biol. 1988; 199: 241-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although it is possible that ADP-ribosylation and association with the RpbA protein modulate transcription in vivo, transcription initiation from a middle promoter in vitro requires only theE. coli RNAP holoenzyme, and the purified T4 proteins MotA and AsiA (5Ouhammouch M. Orsini G. Brody E.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 551-570Crossref Google Scholar, 6Ouhammouch M. Adelman K. Harvey S.R. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AsiA is a 10.6-kDa protein that was first identified through its tight association with the ς70 subunit of RNAP, and the resulting inhibition of transcription at E. coli and T4 early promoters (6Ouhammouch M. Adelman K. Harvey S.R. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Stevens A. Losick R. Chamberlin M. RNA Polymerase.

Ouhammouch M. LeCaer J.-P. Brody E.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 85-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between AsiA and ς70 is thought to decrease the affinity of ς70 for the core polymerase (8Stevens A. Losick R. Chamberlin M. RNA Polymerase. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1976: 617-627Google Scholar, 10Orsini G. Ouhammouch M. LeCaer J.-P. Brody E.N. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 85-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and diminish the binding of RNA polymerase to phages T4 and T7 DNA (9Stevens A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 475: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, AsiA is a coactivator of middle transcription, which also requires the ς70 subunit (6Ouhammouch M. Adelman K. Harvey S.R. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Therefore, the activity of AsiA cannot be merely a result of ς70-core dissociation. In light of its dual role, and the relative simplicity of the prokaryotic system in which it functions, the study of AsiA should provide some insight into how the activity of a major sigma factor is regulated through specific protein-protein interactions. Numerous kinetic and structural studies of the complexes formed between the E. coli RNAP holoenzyme (R) and several promoter sequences (P) have resulted in the following basic model for productive transcription initiation (11Record Jr., M.T.

ASM Press, Washington, D.C.1996: 792-821Google Scholar), RPCrepresents the initial closed complex, which is characterized by its sensitivity to competitors such as heparin, and its rapid equilibrium with free DNA. A slow isomerization step leads to the formation of a strained intermediate, RPI. This transition, which renders the complex insensitive to challenge by polynucleotides, is proposed to involve substantial untwisting or bending of the DNA in the spacer region (14Travers A.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 22: 181-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 15Buckle M. Buc H. Travers A.A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2619-2625Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 16Rees W.A. Keller R.W. Vesenka J.P. Yang G. Bustamante C. Science. 1993; 260: 1646-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, it is not until the appearance of the open complex, RPO, that strand separation is detected near the transcription start site. The addition of ribonucleotides (NTP) allows for the formation of the initiated complex (RPinit), in which abortive products (AP), are reiteratively synthesized (see,e.g., Ref. 17Carpousis A.J. Gralla J.D. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3245-3253Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This natural cycling ceases upon promoter clearance and the entry into the stable ternary elongation complex RPE. Transcription regulators that act at nearly every point in this model have been described. The series of experiments presented below is an attempt to identify the step (or steps) in this pathway that are affected by AsiA. To accomplish this, we studied the inhibitory effects of AsiA on both the well characterized E. coli promoterlac UV5, and the T4 early promoter P15.0. A comparison is drawn between these results and the stimulatory effects of AsiA observed with the T4 middle promoter PrIIB2. QIAquick spin columns were from QIAGEN. Sephacryl-100 was purchased from Pharmacia, Affi-Gel Blue Gel was from Bio-Rad. Enzymes were obtained from the following suppliers: T4 polynucleotide kinase from New England Biolabs, Taq Plus from Stratagene, and DNase I from Boehringer Mannheim. Radioactively labeled nucleoside triphosphates were obtained from ICN. Plasmid pOMlacUV5 is a derivative of pOM70 (18Richet E. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). At its unique EcoRI site, it contains a 203-bp lac insert giving rise to a 125-nucleotide transcript originating from the lac UV5 promoter (19Schaeffer F. Kolb A. Buc H. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This plasmid also harbors a strong promoter responsible for the synthesis of RNA I, a 108-nucleotide transcript involved in the regulation of plasmid replication (18Richet E. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The 203-bp DNA fragment lac L8UV5 used for abortive transcription was obtained as described (19Schaeffer F. Kolb A. Buc H. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the absence of CRP (the cyclic AMP receptor protein), the L8 mutation at position −66 of the lac UV5 promoter has no effect on the transcriptional properties monitored in this study, and will therefore be referred to as lac UV5 in the text. The DNA fragments containing the T4 early promoter P15.0 (132 bp), or the T4 middle promoter PrIIB2 (158 bp) were obtained by performing polymerase chain reaction on T4 DNA using Taq Plus polymerase. The primers used to amplify the P15.0 fragment were uniquely end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The PrIIB2 fragment used previously (6Ouhammouch M. Adelman K. Harvey S.R. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) was uniformly radiolabeled by performing polymerase chain reaction in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The fragments were purified using spin columns. E. coliRNA polymerase was purified according to the method of Burgess and Jendrisack (20Burgess R.R. Jendrisack J.J. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4634-4638Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). A Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel of the purified enzyme was scanned with a densitometer and the ratio of ς70 to the core enzyme was estimated to be 0.65–0.70. Phage T4 MotA and AsiA proteins were purified as described (6Ouhammouch M. Adelman K. Harvey S.R. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) with an additional purification step for AsiA on Affi-Gel Blue Gel, which eliminated a contaminating DNase activity (21Mc Coy M.I.M. Lubben T.H. Gumport R.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 562: 149-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The resulting AsiA preparation was more than 957 homogeneous. GSTς(506) was overexpressed using the plasmid pGEXς(506) (gift of Carol Gross) and purified as described (22Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). The standard reaction buffer, used for transcription, gel shift, and DNase I footprinting experiments on the T4 fragments, contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 100 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT. Gel filtration was accomplished using 7-ml Sephacryl-100HR columns which had been equilibrated with TGED (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, 57 glycerol) plus 50 mm KCl. The 434 repressor and lysozyme were used as size markers, eluting maximally at the positions given in the legend to Fig. 1. Three nanomoles of AsiA, GSTς(506), or both were preincubated in a total volume of 225 ॖl at room temperature for 15 min, then applied to the column. Fractions of 225 ॖl were collected and precipitated with an equal volume of 207 trichloroacetic acid. Pellets were rinsed twice with acetone before being resolved by 16.57 SDS-PAGE. After Coomassie staining, a scanning densitometer was used to analyze the proteins present in each column fraction. Standard protein curves were constructed from densitometric scans of protein bands corresponding to known amounts of either AsiA or GSTς(506), in the range between 50 and 400 pmol (protein concentrations were determined both by the BCA assay from Pierce and protein assay from Bio-Rad). These standards and the peak fractions from the sizing columns were resolved on the same SDS-polyacrylamide gel, stained, and analyzed by densitometry to estimate the amount of AsiA and GSTς(506) present in each column fraction. The abortive initiation assay (12Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar,23Mc Clure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1994; 30: 397-411PubMed Google Scholar) was performed at 37 °C in 50 ॖl containing the final concentrations of the following components: 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm DTT, 500 ॖg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin, 500 ॖm ApA, 2 nm lac L8UV5 DNA fragment, 50 ॖm UTP, and 1 ॖCi of [α-32P]UTP. The enzyme was first incubated for 10 min with either buffer or AsiA. This was followed by a 15-min incubation of the above mixture with the lac L8UV5 DNA fragment. The incorporation of pU was initiated by the addition of [α-32P]UTP and ApA at the above mentioned final concentrations. At 15 and 30 min of incorporation time, 15-ॖl aliquots of the reaction mixture were spotted onto Whatman no. 3MM chromatography paper prespotted with 100 mm EDTA. The abortive transcription product ApApUpU was separated from UTP by ascending chromatography in water-ammonium sulfate-isopropanol (WASP) solvent (23Mc Clure W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The incorporation of pU in the product was quantitated with the help of a PhosphorImager. The transcription protocol for pOMlacUV5 is described in the legend to Fig. 3. Transcription buffer contained 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm DTT, and 100 ॖg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin. Elongation reactions, in a final volume of 12 ॖl, contained 100 ॖm ATP, CTP, and GTP, 10 ॖm UTP, 0.6 ॖCi of [α-32P]UTP, and 200 ॖg/ml heparin. Transcription on the linear templates P15.0 and PrIIB2 was assayed in standard reaction buffer, using the conditions described for native gel shift experiments, with the addition of rNTPs at the concentrations given above, and heparin (as indicated) to a final concentration of 670 ॖg/ml. All RNA was analyzed by electrophoresis of the reaction products on 77 polyacrylamide gels containing 7m urea. Quantification of the transcripts was performed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) using the ImageQuant software. Reactions for DNase I digestion contained P15.0 DNA (labeled on the nontemplate strand) at 10 nm in a 10-ॖl volume, in the presence of 50 nm RNAP holoenzyme where indicated. The DNA (or complex) was preincubated at either 4 °C or 37 °C for 10 min, then challenged for 1 min with nonspecific competitor (0.015 ॖg/ॖl poly(dI-dC)) in 2 ॖl, before DNase I was added (100 ng/ml for 45 s at 37 °C, or 1 ॖg/ml for 4 min at 4 °C). The reactions in the absence of RNA polymerase were terminated with 30 ॖl of stop solution (3.75 mNH4 acetate, 15 mm EDTA, 0.03 ॖg/ॖl poly(dI-dC)), while 2 ॖl of a 307 glucose, 125 mm EDTA solution were added to the polymerase-containing samples, and the protein-bound DNA separated from free DNA by electrophoresis through a 57 native polyacrylamide gel (as described below). The retarded complex was visualized by autoradiography, cut from the gel, and eluted overnight in elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.27 SDS, and 1 m LiCl). All reactions were phenol-extracted and ethanol-precipitated, and the DNA dissolved in 4 ॖl of formamide loading dye. The samples were then electrophoresed through an 87 polyacrylamide, 7 m urea sequencing gel. Base positions were determined using G + A sequencing ladders generated as described by Maxam and Gilbert (25Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar). Complexes for gel shift experiments on the 5′-labeled P15.0 fragment were formed at 4 °C in standard reaction buffer, plus acetylated bovine serum albumin (100 ॖg/ml), under the conditions given in the figure legend. After 10 min, these complexes were challenged with 2 ॖl of loading solution (307 glucose), which contained heparin (final concentration 670 ॖg/ml), AsiA (final concentration 100 nm), or both, as indicated. The reactions were incubated for 1 min (or as indicated) before being loaded onto 57 polyacrylamide native gels running at 200 V, and electrophoresed for 2 h at 6 °C. The radioactivity was measured using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and the ImageQuant software. Complexed DNA was defined as the radioactivity present in the discrete RNAP-DNA complexes (Fig. 5 A, designated by arrows). In Fig.5 B, this quantity is plotted as the fraction of the total radioactivity present in each lane. Mobility shift experiments were performed on the PrIIB2 DNA under conditions described previously for middle-mode transcription from this promoter (6Ouhammouch M. Adelman K. Harvey S.R. Orsini G. Brody E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Concentrations given below represent the final concentrations present before loading. Reactions containing the32P-labeled PrIIB2 fragment (2.5 nm) and MotA (100 nm) were preincubated on ice for 5 min. Core polymerase or RNAP holoenzyme (5 nm) was added, followed by AsiA (0, 10, or 25 nm, as indicated). Nonspecific competitor (0.015 ॖg/ॖl poly(dI-dC)) was also supplied to the samples at 37 °C. All reactions (10 ॖl) were incubated at either 4 °C or 37 °C for 15 min before adding 2 ॖl of loading solution, which contained heparin (670 ॖg/ml), as shown in the figure legend. The resulting complexes were resolved as described above. To study the stoichiometry of the physical interaction between ς70 and the AsiA protein, we used a GST-ς70fusion protein, GSTς(506), which contains the C-terminal 108 amino acids of ς70, fused to the GST moiety (described in Ref.22Dombroski A.J. Walter W.A. Record M.T. Siegele D.A. Gross C.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 501-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). To ensure that GSTς(506) harbors the full site for AsiA binding, we analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift the interaction of125I-labeled AsiA with both full-length ς70, and GSTς(506) (data not shown). Measuring the fraction of AsiA bound to an excess of either ς70 or GSTς(506), yielded similar binding curves (data not shown), demonstrating that the region of ς70 present in GSTς(506) is sufficient for AsiA binding. This evidence confirms and quantifies the data of Severinovaet al. (26Severinova E. Severinov K. Fenyo D. Marr M. Brody E.N. Roberts J.W. Chait B.T. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 263: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), who recently localized the AsiA binding region to within the C-terminal 63 amino acids of ς70. We then used gel filtration to determine the stoichiometry of the interaction between GSTς(506) and AsiA. The GSTς(506) fusion (41 kDa) and the AsiA protein (10 kDa) were initially passed over sizing columns separately, and their elution profiles determined by electrophoresis of the column fractions on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Fig. 1, A and B). In Fig. 1 C, AsiA was preincubated with an equimolar amount of GSTς(506) before gel filtration. Identical analysis of these column fractions shows that the AsiA protein clearly coelutes with GSTς(506) in fractions 21–28 (Fig. 1 C); this is significantly earlier than the position at which AsiA elutes alone (Fig. 1 B, fractions 28–31). The interaction of GSTς(506) with the AsiA protein was specific to the ς506–613 portion of this fusion protein, since AsiA does not coelute with an unfused GST moiety (data not shown). We estimated the molar ratio of the proteins in AsiA-GSTς(506) complexes by scanning densitometry of SDS-polyacrylamide gels similar to that shown in Fig. 1 C (described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡). Table I, part A, presents the quantitative analysis of the column fractions from co-chromatography of 3 nmol of each protein, yielding a definitive stoichiometry of 1:1. To demonstrate the uniqueness of this complex, the experiment was repeated with 6 nmol of AsiA and 2 nmol of GSTς(506). These results are shown in Table I, part B.

Abortive transcription assays were used to analyze the effect of AsiA on open promoter complex formation and initiation by theE. coli RNAP at the lac UV5 promoter. We measured the steady-state levels of the tetranucleotide ApApUpU released during the abortive cycling of RNAP at this promoter in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of AsiA (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡). Fig. 2 shows that AsiA is a potent inhibitor of one or more of the steps leading to the formation of the transcriptionally competent open complexes. Since this method assays only the events leading to RPinit, AsiA activity must precede promoter clearance. Furthermore, for the low AsiA concentrations, five experimental points can be fitted to a straight line which, when extrapolated, intersects the x axis at ∼100 nm AsiA. This reflects the effective concentration of ς70 present in these reactions (see 舠Experimental Procedures舡), indicating that the 1:1 stoichiometry established for the free AsiA-ς70 complex (Table I), is maintained when the complex is part of the functional RNAP holoenzyme. To refine our understanding of AsiA function, single round in vitro transcription experiments were designed to analyze the effects of AsiA on the formation of open complexes at thelac UV5 promoter, as well as its effects on such preformed complexes (legend to Fig. 3). RNAP was first preincubated with increasing concentrations of AsiA prior to the addition of the DNA template (supercoiled pOMlacUV5). RNAP-promoter complex formation was then allowed for 10 min at 37 °C, before a single round of transcription was initiated. Fig.3 A shows that AsiA inhibits the synthesis of the 125-nucleotide lac UV5 transcript, and the 108-nucleotide RNA I transcript, to the same extent. The quantitation of this effect is shown in Fig. 3 C. A very steep inhibition profile is reproducibly obtained with a residual activity of approximately 107 at the highest AsiA concentration tested. In contrast, when open complexes were allowed to form prior to the addition of AsiA, the levels of transcript generated are not affected, even in the presence of a 30-fold molar excess of AsiA over the RNAP (Fig. 3, B andC). These results imply that although AsiA inhibits a step leading to the formation of the open complex RPO, its presence affects neither the stability of such a preformed complex nor the subsequent steps in the transcription pathway. We next investigated the effects of AsiA on the formation and stability of RNAP-promoter complexes formed earlier in the series of events which lead to promoter opening. Previous studies have demonstrated that different transient intermediates can be accumulated by varying the incubation temperature. The closed complex, RPC, is favored at temperatures of 8 °C or lower, intermediate complexes RPI are seen between 8 °C and 21 °C, while the open complex RPO is predominant above 22 °C. The lac UV5 promoter has been extremely well characterized in this regard, and much is known about its specific kinetic properties. Challenge experiments demonstrate that, like RPO, the RPI complexes are not perturbed by nonspecific competitors such as poly(dA-dT), and that RPC disappears rapidly in their presence (12Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 27Straney D.C. Crothers D.M. Cell. 1985; 43: 449-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Thus, the addition of poly(dA-dT) to preformed complexes allowed for the determination of the dissociation rate (k r) and the half-life (t 1/2) of the complexes which form in the range of 14 °C to 37 °C (12Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We chose 16 °C, a temperature that favors the accumulation of RPI, to perform similar challenge experiments onlac UV5. However, rather than challenging the complex with a nonspecific competitor, we added AsiA in a 5-fold molar excess over the RNAP holoenzyme, and then monitored the decay of the RPIcomplexes by the abortive transcription assay (see legend to Fig.4 and 舠Experimental Procedures舡). The initial challenge by AsiA affected only a small fraction of the species formed at 16 °C, indicating that the majority of these complexes are not immediately sensitive to AsiA (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4, the steady decay of transcriptionally active species in the presence of AsiA was reproducibly observed, with an estimated half-life of 20 min. This agrees, within experimental error, with the values previously reported for this promoter (t 1/2 = 20 min at 14 °C, and t 1/2 = 24 min at 17 °C; Ref.12Buc H. McClure W.R. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2712-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). This suggests that AsiA and the competitor poly(dA-dT) have the same global effect on the complexes formed at 16 °C; neither alters the dissociation rate of the complex RPI. The equilibrium between RPC and the free species (R and P), is extremely rapid with the lac UV5 promoter, and consequently was not monitored during this experiment. Nonetheless, the inability of the polymerase to reassociate with the DNA to form transcriptionally competent complexes indicates that AsiA inhibits a step leading to the formation of RPI complexes. To further investigate this inhibition, and to ensure that these results are not specific to the lac UV5 promoter, we continued our analysis on the T4 early promoter P15.0. T4 early promoters possess the conserved hexamers at −10 and −35, which are typical of ς70-dependent E. colipromoters. In addition, the consensus sequences often extend beyond these regions, endowing T4 early promoters with a"

These activated PTKs phosphorylate a variety of cellular substrates and regulate divergent signaling pathways including increases in free cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+] i), activation of Ras, and activation of Ras-related small G proteins. Activation of these signaling pathways is mediated by phospholipase C (PLC), the Shc and Grb2 adaptor proteins, and the vav proto-oncogene product, respectively. BCR-induced increases in [Ca2+] i are mediated by tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 (17Carter R.H. Park D.J. Rhee S.G. Fearon D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Grb2 is constitutively associated with SoS, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that facilitates exchange of GDP to GTP for Ras. Hence, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc can result in the formation of a Shc·Grb2·SoS complex to regulate Ras-mediated cellular proliferation (30Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 623-636PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to SoS, recent studies have demonstrated that Vav serves as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho family of small GTPases (34Crespo P. Bustelo X.R. Aaronson D.S. Coso O.A.

Although proximal PTKs are required for these three signaling pathways, the mechanisms by which the proximal PTKs regulate these distinct signaling pathways remain uncertain. To investigate these mechanisms, we analyzed the spectrum of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that interact with PLCγ, Grb2, and Vav. We describe here the identification of two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with apparentM r values of 70,000 and 68,000 which interact with all three signaling proteins. Together, these data suggest that these two proteins may facilitate the integration of multiple signal transduction pathways to coordinate B cell activation.

Stable transfection of cells was performed as described previously (44Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19641-19644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In brief, 107Daudi cells were electroporated with 25 ॖg of linearized cDNA using a BTX 600 Electroporator (Biotechnologies and Experimental Research Inc., San Diego). Conditions used for electroporation were 1,250 microfarads, 250 V, and a resistance setting of R6. Cells at limiting dilution were then selected in 0.5 ॖg/ml puromycin to generate stable clones. Cell lysates were diluted 6-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, resulting in a buffer concentration of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mmNaCl. The diluted sample was loaded onto a Mono Q anion exchange column (Pharmacia) and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0.025–1m) in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.17 Nonidet P-40 at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 4 °C. 20 fractions (1 ml each) were collected. Samples (50 ॖl) from each fraction were then assayed for PLCγ1-binding phosphoproteins using a GST-PLCγ1 fusion protein as described above. Given the critical roles that PLCγ1 and Grb2 play in regulating [Ca2+] i mobilization and Ras activation, respectively, we analyzed tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins that interact with these molecules after BCR stimulation. GST fusion proteins containing either full-length Grb2 or the two SH2 domains of PLCγ1 were incubated with either resting or BCR-activated Ramos B cell lysates. Bound proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-Tyr(P) mAb (Fig.1 A, left panel). Four major tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins withM r values of 150,000, 120,000, 70,000, and 68,000 bound a full-length Grb2 fusion protein from BCR-activated cell lysates (Fig. 1 A, left panel, lane 4). In contrast, four predominant tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins withM r values of 76,000, 72,000, 70,000, and 68,000 were precipitated by a fusion protein containing the tandem SH2 domains of PLCγ1 (Fig. 1 A, left panel, lane 6). No phosphoproteins bound Grb2 or PLCγ1 in unstimulated cells (Fig. 1 A, left panel, lanes 3 and5). For reference, we have designated the four PLCγ1-interacting phosphoproteins of M r values 76,000, 72,000, 70,000, and 68,000 as proteins 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively (Fig. 1 A, left panel). These tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins did not interact with GST or a fusion protein containing the dual SH2 domains of ZAP-70 (Fig. 1 A,left panel, lanes 1, 2, 7, and 8). Similar results were obtained with the Daudi B cell line (data not shown). To test whether pp70 and pp68, which interact with the Grb2 fusion protein, were identical to proteins 3 and 4, which interact with the PLCγ1 fusion protein, we depleted activated B cell lysates with the Grb2 fusion protein and then analyzed the ability of PLCγ1 to bind proteins 3 and 4. Sequential precipitation by the Grb2 fusion protein depleted proteins 3 and 4, which interacted with PLCγ1 (Fig.1 B, lanes 1–4). In contrast, proteins 1 and 2 still bound PLCγ1 after depletion by Grb2 (Fig. 1 B,lane 4). Conversely, the PLCγ1 fusion protein depleted the Grb2-binding proteins pp70 and pp68, but not pp150 or pp120 (Fig.1 B, lanes 5–8). Together, these data demonstrate that pp70 and pp68, which bind Grb2, are identical to phosphoproteins 3 and 4, respectively, which interact with PLCγ1. Although these in vitro binding experiments demonstrated common and unique phosphoproteins that bound PLCγ1 and Grb2, we determined whether these interactions also occurred in vivo. PLCγ1 was immunoprecipitated from either resting or BCR-stimulated Ramos cells and analyzed by Western blot analysis with an anti-Tyr(P) mAb. Consistent with the in vitro binding experiments, proteins 1–4 were detected in PLCγ1 immunoprecipitates from BCR-activated cell lysates, although the stoichiometry of binding of proteins 1 and 2 was lower in the PLCγ1 immunoprecipitates than thein vitro binding experiments (Fig.2 A, lanes 2 and5). In addition to tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ1, tyrosine phosphoproteins with M r values of 160,000, 150,000, and 120,000 also coimmunoprecipitated with PLCγ1 after BCR cross-linking. pp120 was identified as the c-cblproto-oncogene product by Western blot analysis (data not shown). No tyrosine phosphoproteins were detected in PLCγ1 immunoprecipitates from unstimulated cells or in control immunoprecipitates with normal rabbit serum (NRS, Fig. 2 A, lanes 1,3, and 4). Because many B cells utilize the γ2 isoform of PLC (PLCγ2) (18Hempel W.M. Schatzman R.C. DeFranco A.L. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3021-3027PubMed Google Scholar, 19Coggeshall K.M. McHugh J.C. Altman A.

Commun. 1992; 183: 411-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), we also analyzed the ability of proteins 1–4 to associate with PLCγ2 in vivo. Proteins 1, 3, and 4 were detected in immunoprecipitates of PLCγ2 from BCR-activated Daudi B cells. Protein 2 was below the level of detection and/or resolution in these immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2 B). Together, these results demonstrate that phosphoproteins 1, 3, and 4 interact with both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 after BCR activation. To test whether proteins 3 and 4 also interacted with Grb2 in vivo, we generated Daudi B cell lines that stably express a myc epitope-tagged form of Grb2. This strategy was utilized to exclude the possibility that the immunoprecipitating antibody may inhibit the binding of Grb2-interacting proteins. Two representative clones, D28 and D35, which overexpress Grb2, are shown in Fig. 2 C,lanes 2 and 3. Similar to the in vitrobinding experiments, proteins 3 and 4 coimmunoprecipitated with Grb2 after BCR cross-linking (Fig. 2 D, lane 4). Taken together, these in vitro binding and in vivoimmunoprecipitation studies demonstrate that phosphoproteins 3 and 4 represent Grb2- and PLCγ-binding proteins, whereas phosphoproteins 1 and 2 interact with PLCγ. Grb2 is composed of a single SH2 domain flanked by two SH3 domains. To identify the structural domains within Grb2 which interact with proteins 3 and 4, we generated GST-Grb2 fusion proteins in which each domain was disrupted by a single point mutation. Interestingly, Grb2 mutants with a single domain disrupted retained their ability to interact in vitrowith both proteins 3 and 4, although protein 3 appeared to have a slight preference for the COOH-terminal SH3 domain and protein 4 for the NH2-terminal SH3 and SH2 domains (Fig.3 A, top panel,lanes 2–4). Mutation of any combination of SH2 or SH3 domains eliminated the binding of proteins 3 and 4 to Grb 2 (Fig.3 A, top panel, lanes 5–7). Hence, cooperation of SH2 and SH3 domains is required for the efficient interaction of Grb2 with proteins 3 and 4. To identify the structural domains within PLCγ1 which mediate its interaction with proteins 1–4, we analyzed the ability of individual SH2 domains to bind these proteins. The COOH-terminal, but not the NH2-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ1 was sufficient to bind proteins 1–4 (Fig. 3 B, top panel, lanes 2 and 3). In this experiment, proteins 2 and 3 comigrated, although in many other experiments these two proteins could be resolved (see Fig. 5). In contrast, the SH3 domain of PLCγ1 failed to interact with any of these four phosphoproteins (Fig. 3 B,lane 4). Rather, the SH3 domain of PLCγ1 interacted with pp120 cbl and pp150 (Fig. 3 B,lane 4, and data not shown). The binding characteristics of proteins 3 and 4 are similar to SLP-76, a M r76,000 tyrosine phophosprotein recently described in T cells which binds PLCγ1 and Grb2 in vitro (49Jackman J.K. Motto D.G.

Low levels of SLP-76 mRNA and protein have been described in B cells (49Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A. Findell P.R. J. Biol.

Med. 1996; 184: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). To determine whether proteins 3 or 4 represented SLP-76, we analyzed B cell lysates by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting with anti-SLP-76 antibodies. SLP-76 protein was not detected in any of the six B cell lines examined (Fig.4 A, lanes 1–6). In contrast, SLP-76 was readily detected in the Jurkat T cell line (Fig.4 A, lane 7). In addition, although proteins 3 and 4 bound both Grb2 and PLCγ1 fusion proteins (Fig. 1 A), they failed to be recognized by an anti-SLP-76 mAb (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1–4 and 6–9). In contrast, SLP-76 from activated Jurkat T cells readily bound Grb2 and PLCγ1 (Fig.4 B, lanes 5 and 10). Similar data were obtained using normal mouse B cells (data not shown). To resolve better the separation of proteins 1–4 to facilitate their identification, we separated BCR-activated Ramos cell lysates by anion exchange chromatography. Eluted proteins were analyzed by binding to the PLCγ1 fusion protein and immunoblotting with an anti-Tyr(P) mAb (Fig. 5, left panel). Protein 2 was eluted in fractions 7 and 8 (∼0.3 m NaCl), proteins 3 and 4 in fractions 9 and 10 (∼0.4 m NaCl), and protein 1 in fractions 10 and 11 (∼0.45 m NaCl). These fractions were then immunoblotted with antibodies against molecules implicated in BCR activation with similar M r mobilities. Protein 2 was recognized by an anti-Syk antiserum (Fig. 5, right panel, lane 1) and is consistent with previous reports that Syk interacts with PLCγ1 after BCR cross-linking (51Sillman A.L. Monroe J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11806-11811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 52Law C.L. Chandran K.A. Sidorenko S.P. Clark E.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis with antibodies directed against SHP-1, SHP-2, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and Sam68 failed to recognize protein 1, 3, or 4 (data not shown). Hence, proteins 3 and 4 do not represent any of these signaling molecules. Although SLP-76 was not expressed in normal murine B cells or the B cell lines analyzed, the similar abilities of proteins 3 and 4 to interact with Grb2 and PLCγ1 suggested that these two proteins may represent B cell homologs of SLP-76. Because SLP-76 has been recently demonstrated to interact with the vav proto-oncogene product (53Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 54Onodera H. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Rothstein D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22225-22230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 55Tuosto L. Michel F. Acuto O. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1161-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we analyzed the ability of proteins 3 and 4 also to interact with Vav. Vav immunoprecipitates from BCR-activated cells demonstrated the association of Vav with two tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins with mobilities identical to the Grb2- and PLC-binding phosphoproteins 3 and 4 (Fig. 6 A, lane 4). These two phosphoproteins were not detected in Vav immunoprecipitates from resting B cells or in control immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6 A, lanes 1–3). Mapping studies using GST fusion proteins containing the Vav SH2 or SH3 domains demonstrated that the Vav SH2 domain was sufficient for its interaction with these two phosphoproteins (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). Although a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with mobility identical to that of protein 1 was also precipitated by the SH2 domain of Vav (Fig.6 B, lane 3), this interaction was not observedin vivo (Fig. 6 A, lane 4). To confirm that the two Vav-binding phosphoproteins were the same as the Grb2- and PLCγ1-binding proteins 3 and 4, we again performed sequential depletion studies using Grb2, PLCγ, and Vav fusion proteins. Sequential precipitation with the Grb2 fusion protein depleted proteins 3 and 4, which interact with the Vav SH2 domain (Fig.6 C, lanes 1–4). In addition, sequential precipitation with the PLCγ1 SH2 domains depleted the Vav-interacting proteins 3 and 4 (Fig. 6 C, lanes 6–9). Together, these experiments demonstrate that phosphoproteins 3 and 4 interact with at least three distinct signaling adaptor/effector molecules, Grb2, PLCγ, and Vav. To provide further evidence that proteins 3 and 4 may be functionally homologous to SLP-76, we analyzed whether SLP-76 could compete with proteins 3 and 4 in their interaction with the SH2 domain of Vav. BCR-activated cell lysates were incubated with a Vav SH2 domain fusion protein in the absence (Fig. 7,top panel, lane 1) or in the presence of unphosphorylated (lane 2) or phosphorylated (lane 3) forms of SLP-76. We have demonstrated previously that SLP-76 serves as a downstream substrate of the ZAP-70 and Syk PTKs and can be phosphorylated by coinfection of SLP-76 with activated ZAP-70 or Syk PTKs in insect Sf9 cells (44Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K. Flotow H. Wilkinson S.E. Williams D.H. Johnson R. Kong G. Chan A.C. Findell P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19641-19644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Only tyrosine-phosphorylated SLP-76 significantly decreased the ability of proteins 3 and 4 to bind the Vav SH2 domain (Fig. 7, top panel, lane 3). No inhibition of binding of proteins 3 or 4 was observed in the presence of unphosphorylated SLP-76 (lane 2) despite the presence of equal amount of SLP-76 in both conditions (Fig. 7, bottom panel, lanes 2 and 3) and is consistent with the SH2-phosphotyrosine based interaction of Vav with proteins 3 and 4 (Fig. 6 B). A similar requirement for tyrosine-phosphorylated SLP-76 was observed in competition experiments with the PLCγ1 SH2 domain (data not shown). Together, these data further support the hypothesis that proteins 3 and 4 likely represent B cell counterparts of SLP-76. Tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins after BCR activation plays critical roles in PLCγ-, Vav-, and Shc/Grb2-mediated [Ca2+] i mobilization, c-Jun N-terminal kinase activation, and Ras activation, respectively. Phosphorylation can directly mediate activation of enzymes, such as PLCγ and Vav (20Nishibe S. Wahl M.I. Hernandez-Sotomayor S.M. Tonk N.K. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. Science. 1990; 250: 1253-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 35Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrum A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation can mediate the assembly and/or localization of effector proteins through interactions facilitated by SH2 and PTB domains (for review, see Refs. 56van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar and 57Pawson T. Gish G.D. Cell. 1992; 21: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (795) Google Scholar). An example of the latter is represented by the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc to recruit Grb2·SoS to the membrane and mediate Ras activation (28Schlessinger J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Although activation of the proximal Src family, Syk, and Bruton's tyrosine kinases are required for the efficient function of all three signaling pathways, the integration of these distinct signaling pathways is also critical for efficient BCR-mediated function. We provide evidence here of two cellular tyrosine phosphoproteins, pp70 (protein 3) and pp68 (protein 4), which interact with PLCγ, Vav, and Grb2. A M r 70,000 tyrosine phosphoprotein, VAP-1, has been described previously to associate with Vav after BCR cross-linking (38Bustelo X.R. Barbacid M. Science. 1992; 256: 1196-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Given the similarities in binding of pp70 and pp68 to these three effector proteins, pp70 and pp68 may represent differentially phosphorylated forms of the same protein. However, the inability to abrogate the M r difference between pp70 and pp68 by treatment with the serine/threonine protein phosphatases 1 and their identical isoelectric points make this possibility less likely (data not shown). Alternatively, pp70 and pp68 may represent differentially spliced forms of the same gene. Finally, pp70 and pp68 may represent a family of homologous proteins. Molecular characterization of these two proteins is under way to elucidate further their mechanistic and functional roles in BCR activation. We also provide evidence here of the in vivo interaction of a M r 76,000 tyrosine phosphoprotein and Syk with PLCγ1. The latter is consistent with previous observations implicating the biochemical and functional requirements of Syk in [Ca2+] i mobilization (7Takata M. Sabe H. Hata A. Inazu T. Homma Y. Nukada T. Yamamura H. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1341-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 51Sillman A.L. Monroe J.G. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1305-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction of the M r 76,000 phosphoprotein with PLCγ1 was not observed with Vav or Grb2 and likely selectively mediates the [Ca2+] i pathway. Genetic studies have demonstrated the functional importance of PLCγ1, Vav, and Grb2 in B cell function and development. B cells deficient in PLCγ demonstrate a lack of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate hydrolysis and an absence of [Ca2+] i mobilization after BCR cross-linking (43Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Deletion of vavin mice results in an arrest of both B and T cell development (39Tarakhovsky A. Turner M. Schaal S. Mee P.J.

Nature. 1995; 374: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Finally, overexpression of Grb2 results in an augmentation of antigen receptor-mediated activation of cytokine synthesis. 2J. Wardenburg and A. Chan, unpublished observation. Hence, these three signaling and adaptor proteins play requisite roles in normal B cell function. The structural domains within PLCγ1, Vav, and Grb2 which mediate their binding to pp70 and pp68 have also been demonstrated to be functionally important in lymphocyte activation. Mutation of the SH2 domains of PLCγ2 or the SH2 domain of Vav abrogates BCR- or T cell receptor-mediated signaling functions (43Takata M. Homma Y. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 907-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 53Wu J. Motto D.G. Koretzky G.A. Weiss A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 593-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Hence, the ability of these structural domains within PLCγ and Vav to interact with pp70 and pp68 are likely to be important in mediating BCR function. Although BCR activation in naive B cells or B cell lines results in activation of all three major signaling pathways, anergized B cells demonstrate a lack of coordination of these three signaling pathways. Studies by Goodnow and colleagues (58Healy J.I. Dolmetsch R.E. Timmerman L.A. Cyster J.G. Thomas M.L. Crabtree G.R. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 419-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that although anergized B cells activate the [Ca2+] i and Ras pathways, no activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase or nuclear localization of nuclear factor κB was observed in these cells. Hence, the integration of these major signaling pathways, which potentially could be regulated by pp70 and pp68, is required for normal B cell function. The interaction of pp70 and pp68 with Grb2, PLCγ, and Vav in B cells is similar to the interaction of a linker protein, SLP-76, with Grb2, PLCγ, and Vav in T cells. SLP-76 interacts in vitro with Grb2 fusion protein as well as with Vav and PLCγ1 after T cell receptor cross-linking (49Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A.

Moreover, SLP-76 is phosphorylated by ZAP-70 and is required for T cell receptor-mediated activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells and the IL-2 gene (44Wardenburg J.B. Fu C. Jackman J.K.

Although SLP-76 mRNA is expressed in several B cell lines and SLP-76 protein has been reported in WEHI-231 cells (49Jackman J.K. Motto D.G. Sun Q. Tanemoto M. Turck C.W. Peltz G.A. Koretzky G.A.

In addition, pp70 and pp68 migrate faster on SDS-polyacrylamide gels than SLP-76. However, pp70 and pp68 interact with Grb2, PLCγ1, and Vav in a fashion similar to that of SLP-76. In addition, the ability of tyrosine-phosphorylated SLP-76 to compete with pp70 and pp68 for their interactions with Vav and PLCγ1 (Fig. 7 and data not shown) suggests that pp70 and pp68 may contain structural motifs similar to those present within SLP-76 required for its interaction with Vav and PLCγ1. We therefore propose that these two proteins may represent B cell proteins that are related to SLP-76.

https://openalex.org/W2060826500,"Amino acid sequences rich in Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr (PEST) are common to rapidly degraded proteins (Rogers, S., Wells, R. & Rechsteiner, M. (1986)Science 234, 364–368). On pancreatic bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL), PEST sequences are present in the C-terminal region of the enzyme to which is associated theO-glycosylation. We have postulated that theO-glycosylation of BSDL may contribute to mask PEST sequences and to trigger the secretion of this enzyme instead of its delivery into a degradative pathway (Bruneau, N., and Lombardo, D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 13524–13523). To further examine the role of the O-linked glycosylation on BSDL metabolism, rat pancreatic BSDL cDNA was stably transfected into two Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, the CHO K1 wild-type line and the O-glycosylation defective CHO ldlD line. In these latter cells, O-glycosylation can be reversibly modulated by culture conditions. Results indicate that the rate of BSDL synthesis by transfected CHO K1 or CHO ldlD cells reflects, independently of culture conditions, the amount of mRNA specific for BSDL present in these transfected cells. Nevertheless, the rate of secretion of the enzyme depends upon cell culture conditions and increases with the cell capability to O-glycosylate C-terminal tandem-repeated sequences. Immunoprecipitation experiments performed on cell lysates suggested that a rapid degradation of BSDL occurred particularly when transfected CHO ldlD cells were cultured under non-permissive conditions. We further showed that BSDL secreted by CHO ldlD cells grown under non-permissive conditions that normally prevent O-glycosylation incorporated galactose and was reactive with peanut agglutinin, which recognizes the core structure ofO-linked glycans. We concluded that the BSDL expressed by CHO ldlD cells grown under non-permissive conditions was rapidly degraded but a fraction of the enzyme was allowed toO-glycosylate and consequently was secreted. Amino acid sequences rich in Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr (PEST) are common to rapidly degraded proteins (Rogers, S., Wells, R. & Rechsteiner, M. (1986)Science 234, 364–368). On pancreatic bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL), PEST sequences are present in the C-terminal region of the enzyme to which is associated theO-glycosylation. We have postulated that theO-glycosylation of BSDL may contribute to mask PEST sequences and to trigger the secretion of this enzyme instead of its delivery into a degradative pathway (Bruneau, N., and Lombardo, D. (1995) J. Biol. Chem. 270, 13524–13523). To further examine the role of the O-linked glycosylation on BSDL metabolism, rat pancreatic BSDL cDNA was stably transfected into two Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines, the CHO K1 wild-type line and the O-glycosylation defective CHO ldlD line. In these latter cells, O-glycosylation can be reversibly modulated by culture conditions. Results indicate that the rate of BSDL synthesis by transfected CHO K1 or CHO ldlD cells reflects, independently of culture conditions, the amount of mRNA specific for BSDL present in these transfected cells. Nevertheless, the rate of secretion of the enzyme depends upon cell culture conditions and increases with the cell capability to O-glycosylate C-terminal tandem-repeated sequences. Immunoprecipitation experiments performed on cell lysates suggested that a rapid degradation of BSDL occurred particularly when transfected CHO ldlD cells were cultured under non-permissive conditions. We further showed that BSDL secreted by CHO ldlD cells grown under non-permissive conditions that normally prevent O-glycosylation incorporated galactose and was reactive with peanut agglutinin, which recognizes the core structure ofO-linked glycans. We concluded that the BSDL expressed by CHO ldlD cells grown under non-permissive conditions was rapidly degraded but a fraction of the enzyme was allowed toO-glycosylate and consequently was secreted. The bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL, 1The abbreviations used are: BSDL, bile salt-dependent lipase (EC 3.1.1.–); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary (cell line); Grp94, glucose-regulated protein of 94 kDa; FCS, fetal calf serum; apo, apolipoprotein; kb, kilobase pair(s); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate; PNA, peanut agglutinin; PNGase F, peptideN-glycosidase F. 1The abbreviations used are: BSDL, bile salt-dependent lipase (EC 3.1.1.–); CHO, Chinese hamster ovary (cell line); Grp94, glucose-regulated protein of 94 kDa; FCS, fetal calf serum; apo, apolipoprotein; kb, kilobase pair(s); ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DFP, diisopropyl fluorophosphate; PNA, peanut agglutinin; PNGase F, peptideN-glycosidase F. EC 3.1.1.–) secreted by the pancreas plays an essential role in the intestinal processing of cholesterol and lipid soluble vitamins (1Lombardo D. Guy O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 611: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This enzyme, as suggested by its presence in various tissues, may serve different functions depending upon its location (2Winkler K.E. Harrison E.H. Marsh J.B. Glick J.M. Ross A.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 151-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Holtsberg F.W. Ozgur L.E. Garsetti D.E. Myers J. Egan R.W. Clark M.A. Biochem.

Male R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,6Lombardo D. Guy O. Figarella C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 527: 142-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). All sequenced BSDLs have a site for N-linked glycosylation on Asn-187 (7Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar) close to the Ser-194 involved in substrate catalysis (8DiPersio L.P. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16801-16806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This N-linked glycosylation has been shown to be cotranslational and essential for the secretion and expression of a fully active enzyme by pancreatic cells (9Abouakil N. Mas E. Bruneau N. Benajiba A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25755-25763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The size of this protein varies by species as a consequence of the number of C-terminal tandem repeated sequences and because the amount of glycosylation varies from species. The human enzyme possesses 16 of these tandem repeated sequences (10Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Sternby B. Borgström B. Ameis D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is the largest (100 kDa). The rat BSDL has only four of these repeats (7Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), which are absent on the smaller salmon enzyme (5Gjellesvik D.R. Lorens J.B. Male R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 226: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Each tandemly repeated sequence presents a potential site forO-linked glycosylation and is rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T) (7Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 10Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Sternby B. Borgström B. Ameis D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins that are rapidly degraded within eukaryotic cells frequently contain such sequences, referred to as PEST regions (11Rogers S. Wells R. Rechsteiner M. Science. 1986; 234: 364-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1950) Google Scholar). On BSDL, PEST regions coexist with the C-terminal cluster of O-linked oligosaccharides (7Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 10Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Sternby B. Borgström B. Ameis D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and are absent in sequences of other known pancreatic enzymes. Hanson et al. (12Hansson L. Bläckberg L. Edlund M. Lundberg L. Strömqvist M. Hernell O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26692-26698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed that deletion of the C-terminal region of BSDL including the PEST region did not affect the activity of the recombinant enzyme. The truncated BSDL presented the same dependence on bile salts as the native enzyme (12Hansson L. Bläckberg L. Edlund M. Lundberg L. Strömqvist M. Hernell O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26692-26698Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, compared with the full-length enzyme, a truncated variant lacking the C terminus starting from Leu-519 showed an increased susceptibility to proteolysis, suggesting that C-terminal repeats may regulate proteolytic degradation of BSDL (13Loomes K.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 607-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that human (14Bruneau N. Lechene de la Porte P. Sbarra V. Lombardo D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 233: 209-218Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and rat pancreatic BSDL (15Bruneau N. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13524-13533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), in contrast to the other secretory pancreatic enzymes, are associated with intracellular membranes during their secretory process. This association with intracellular membranes, which involves a multimeric folding complex including a protein immunologically related to the glucose-regulated protein of 94 kDa (Grp94), could be essential for theO-glycosylation of the C-terminal tail of BSDL. Consequently, we have postulated that O-glycosylation of the C-terminal repeats that include PEST sequences may contribute to divert BSDL away from a possible degradation route (15Bruneau N. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13524-13533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis and to further examine the role of the glycosylation on BSDL metabolism, rat pancreatic BSDL cDNA was stably transfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells defective forO-linked glycosylation (ldlD line) (16Krieger M. Reddy P. Kozarsky K. Kingsley D. Hobbie L. Penman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 57-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and into wild-type CHO cells (K1 line). Monensin and peanut agglutinin immobilized on agarose (PNA-agarose) were from Sigma. Brefeldin A, sialidase, and leupeptin came from Boehringer (Mannheim, Germany). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, benzamidine, and ॆ-phenyl propionate were from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). Ham's F-12 medium, RPMI medium, fetal calf serum, and Geneticin (G418) were from Life Technologies Inc. [35S]Methionine (Tran35S-label, >1000 Ci/mmol) was from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA).d-[U-14C]Mannose (>300 Ci/mol) andd-[U-14C]galactose (>295 Ci/mol) were from Amersham (Slough, United Kingdom). [3H]Diisopropyl fluorophosphate (>3 Ci/mmol, [3H]DFP) was from NEN Life Science Products (Les Ulis, France). Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was from Oxford Glycosystems (Oxford, United Kingdom) and used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Polyclonal antibodies raised using purified secretory rat BSDL were obtained in our laboratory and isolated by affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (17Abouakil N. Rogalska E. Bonicel J. Lombardo D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 961: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). These antibodies were able to immunoprecipitate non-glycosylated BSDL obtained byin vitro translation using pancreatic mRNA and rabbit reticulocytes (data not shown). Dot blots were performed using antibodies specific for BSDL as primary antibodies and the BM chemiluminescence Western blotting kit (Boehringer) was used to detect the antigen-antibody complexes. Proteins were routinely assayed with the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as standard. The activity on 4-nitrophenyl hexanoate was measured at 410 nm and pH 7.4 in a thermostated cell at 30 °C as described elsewhere (18Gjellesvik D.R. Lombardo D. Walther B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1124: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Gel electrophoreses (SDS-PAGE) were performed on a slab gel of polyacrylamide (7.57) and 0.17 sodium dodecyl sulfate under reducing conditions according to Laemmli (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206660) Google Scholar). The Chinese hamster ovary cell lines CHO K1 (wild-type) and CHO ldlD were supplied by the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD; ATCC designation CCL 61 and SD 1401). The CHO ldlD cells were used with the kind permission of Dr. M. Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA). Each CHO cell line was maintained in 57 CO2 at 37 °C in Ham's F-12 nutrient mixture (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ॖg/ml streptomycin, 0.17 (v/v) fungizone, and fetal calf serum (FCS). The CHO ldlD cell line is defective in O-linked glycosylation when grown in culture medium supplemented with 0.57 (v/v) FCS (non-permissive conditions) (16Krieger M. Reddy P. Kozarsky K. Kingsley D. Hobbie L. Penman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 57-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The reversion of the defect can be obtained by incubating these cells in medium supplemented with 107 (v/v) FCS (permissive conditions) (16Krieger M. Reddy P. Kozarsky K. Kingsley D. Hobbie L. Penman M. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 57-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The cDNA specific for actin was obtained by RT-PCR using specific primers (Life Technologies, Inc.). The Grp94 cDNA was a generous gift of Dr. A. S. Lee (University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA). The cDNA probe (0.5 kb) specific for BSDL was obtained by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (20Roudani S. Pasqualini E. Margotat A. Gastaldi M. Sbarra V. Malezet-Desmoulin C. Lombardo D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 132-144PubMed Google Scholar). The 1-kb cDNA probe for the neomycin phosphotransferase was obtained by digestion of the pMAMneo vector by SmaI and BglII. Purified cDNA probes were 32P-labeled by random priming using [α-32P]dCTP (NEN Life Science Products) and the random primed DNA-labeling kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) to a specific radioactivity of approximately 4 × 108 cpm/ॖg. Total RNAs were extracted from cells using the method of Chirgwin (21Chirgwin J.M. Pryzbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16648) Google Scholar). Thirty ॖg of these total RNAs suspended in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), glyoxal (187), and dimethyl sulfoxide (507) were subjected to electrophoresis on 17 agarose gel. The RNAs were then transferred to nylon membranes (Biodine A Pall-Bio-support, Portsmouth, United Kingdom). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing conditions were as described previously (20Roudani S. Pasqualini E. Margotat A. Gastaldi M. Sbarra V. Malezet-Desmoulin C. Lombardo D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 65: 132-144PubMed Google Scholar). For mRNA quantitation, total RNAs were dotted using a Bio-Dot microfiltration apparatus (Bio-Rad) onto a nitrocellulose membrane (BA 83 type, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) in decreasing rank amount from 30 to 0.45 ॖg/well. Prehybridization and hybridization with specific cDNA probes were performed as above. The amount of specific mRNA was estimated by scanning the autoradiogram as described previously (9Abouakil N. Mas E. Bruneau N. Benajiba A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25755-25763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Densitometric data were plotted against the mass of total RNA; from the slope of each regression line, it was possible to determine the relative amount of specific mRNA (in arbitrary units) in the mixture of total RNA. The rat pancreatic BSDL cDNA inserted into the pECE-1 plasmid, a mammalian cell expression vector utilizing the simian virus 40 early promoter, was used with the kind permission of Dr. W. J. Rutter (University of California, San Francisco, CA). This plasmid referred to as pBSDL was described previously by Han et al. (7Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Expression plasmid pMAMneo, which contains the neomycin phosphotransferase gene conferring the resistance to neomycin analogue Geneticin (G418), was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Stable transfection of CHO K1 and CHO ldlD cells was performed using a lipopolyamine-mediated transfection procedure according to the manufacturer (Transfectam® reagent, Promega). The selection of stable clones was performed for 3 weeks in selection Ham's F-12 medium with G418 (400 ॖg/ml medium); the surviving cells were then trypsinized and cloned by end-limiting dilution method. The stably transfected clones were maintained under the same selection conditions and tested for the BSDL activity in the culture medium. Finally, positive clones were trypsinized and plated in 100-mm dishes. Transfected CHO ldlD cells were progressively accustomed to media containing 0.57 FCS (unpermissive conditions) for at least 24 h before use. Confluent transfected CHO cells were treated with drugs affecting protein traffic. For this purpose, the drug was added from a stock solution (monensin, 10 mm in ethyl alcohol; brefeldin A, 1 mg/ml in PBS: ethyl alcohol (1:1 by volume)) to dishes at the appropriate final concentration. After the required time of incubation, the cell culture medium was withdrawn and saved for further analyses.The corresponding cell layer was washed twice with PBS, scraped with a rubber policeman, and lysed in a 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) buffer (lysis buffer, 200 mmNaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2, 1.57 Triton X-100, 10 ॖg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm benzamidine, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 2 mm ॆ-phenyl propionate). The homogenate was then clarified by centrifugation (20 min, 10,000 × g, 4 °C). The BSDL activity was determined in the cell culture medium and the cell lysate. After 45 min of starvation of CHO cells in methionine-free RPMI medium, dishes were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (20 or 40 ॖCi/ml). The pulse medium was removed after the required time, followed by two quick washes with the chase medium, and cells were chased in Ham's F-12 medium with the required amount of FCS for different time intervals. The chase was stopped by aspirating the medium and cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS without CaCl2 and MgCl2. Cells were then lysed in lysis buffer, and cell lysates were clarified. Supernatant were used for immunoprecipitation. When indicated, cell-free chase medium was also used for immunoprecipitation. One ml of clarified cell lysate or cell-free medium was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 25 ॖg of antibodies to rat BSDL. Protein A (10 mg), prewashed three times with the lysis buffer, was added to antibody-antigen complexes and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C under agitation. The antigen-antibody-Protein A complexes were recovered by centrifugation (10,000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C). The final pellet was then washed twice with the washing buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4) buffer, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.57 Triton X-100), twice with the washing buffer supplemented with 1 m NaCl and 0.17 SDS, and finally twice with 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 5 mm EDTA buffer. The pellet was then transferred into the SDS-PAGE Laemmli's sample buffer, warmed for 2 min at 95 °C, centrifuged, and electrophoresed on SDS-PAGE. When required, a two-cycle immunoprecipitation procedure slightly modified from Doolittle et al. (22Doolittle M.H. Martin D.C. Davis R.C. Reuben M.A. Elovson J. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 195: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) was used. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R250 and destained as above, immersed (30–60 min) in Amplify (Amersham), and autoradiographed using Kodak Bio Max films. The basic protocol for the isolation of the O-linked C-terminal tail of BSDL has been extensively described by Mas et al. (23Mas E. Crotte C. Lecestre D. Michalski J.-C. Escribano M.-J. Lombardo D. Sadoulet M.-O. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitated BSDL was radiolabeled with [3H]DFP on the serine residue (Ser-194) involved in the catalytic site (8DiPersio L.P. Fontaine R.N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16801-16806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This residue is close to Asn-187, which is the unique site for N-linked glycosylation of BSDL (7Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 10Reue K. Zambaux J. Wong H. Lee G. Leete T.H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. Sternby B. Borgström B. Ameis D. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1991; 32: 267-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When required the protein was desialylated with sialidase (10 milliunits in 50 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.0) buffer, 3 h, 37 °C). Because there is no methionine residue between Asn-187 and Ser-194, a cyanogen bromide cleavage of radiolabeled BSDL allows us to separate the radiolabeled N-glycosylated peptide from the C-terminalO-glycosylated peptide that comprises PEST sequences (23Mas E. Crotte C. Lecestre D. Michalski J.-C. Escribano M.-J. Lombardo D. Sadoulet M.-O. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar,24Wang C.-S. Dashti A. Jackson K.W. Yeh J.-C. Cummings R.D. Tang J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10639-10644Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The N- and O-linked glycopeptides were separated on PNA-agarose column equilibrated and eluted with a sodium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer, 1 mm each CaCl2 and MgCl2 (PBS) containing 0.57 Triton X-100. After elution of wash-out fractions, which contained the N-glycosylated radioactive peptide, the column was washed with PBS (+ 0.17 Triton X-100). Finally, bound O-glycosylated material was eluted with 0.3 m lactose in PBS buffer and detected by dot blot as described above. The wild-type CHO K1 and theO-glycosylation-defective CHO ldlD cells were stably transfected with the full-length cDNA of the rat BSDL. Two clones expressing BSDL activity were selected from each cell line and used for these studies. They were referred to as the CHO K1–3B and the CHO ldlD-6B clone, respectively. No enzyme activity above background was expressed in either non-transfected or pMAMneo transfected (control) cell lines. Northern blot analyses were used to assess the mRNA abundance in both CHO K1–3B and CHO ldlD-6B clones. The BSDL mRNA level in stably transfected CHO K1–3B cells was higher than in CHO ldlD-6B cells and was absent in control CHO cells (Fig.1 A). The size of this mRNA (2.0 kb) was of the expected size (7Han J.H. Stratowa C. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1617-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The 300-base pair cDNA probe for actin hybridized with a transcript of the expected size (2.0 kb), indicating no mRNA degradation. We next attempted to determine the relative amount of mRNA transcribed in CHO K1–3B and CHO ldlD-6B clones. As shown on Fig. 1 B, quantitation of the Northern dot represented in the lower panel indicated that the abundance of mRNA was approximately 4–5 times higher in CHO K1–3B than in CHO ldlD-6B cells (the amount of dotted RNA was normalized with the actin probe). The lower expression of BSDL cDNA observed in CHO ldlD-6B cells compared with CHO K1–3B appeared rather specific because parallel quantitation of Grp94 mRNA and neomycin phosphotransferase mRNA taken to represent endogenously and exogenously expressed mRNAs, respectively (25Lee A.S. Bell J. Ting J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4616-4621Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were identical in both cell lines. It is worth noting that the amount of mRNA specific for BSDL was identical in CHO ldlD-6B cultured under permissive and non-permissive conditions (data not shown). The time-dependent synthesis of BSDL was estimated by pulse-labeling of CHO cells with [35S]methionine and immunoprecipitation performed on cell lysates, after an adequate period of chase. The band corresponding to BSDL was quantitated by scanning (9Abouakil N. Mas E. Bruneau N. Benajiba A. Lombardo D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25755-25763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the dark intensity (pixel) at each time of chase was subtracted from that at time 0, giving the amount of neo-synthesized BSDL with time (Fig.2). Slopes thus obtained suggested that the BSDL synthesis was 5 times faster in CHO K1–3B than in CHO ldlD-6B cells. These slopes, normalized for the amount of mRNA specific for BSDL, gave the translational rate (amount of protein produced per min and unit of mRNA), which was, within experimental errors, identical in CHO K1–3B cells and in CHO ldlD-6B cells cultured under permissive or non-permissive conditions. These results showed that culture conditions did not affect either transcriptional or translational processes in transfected CHO cells.Figure 2Synthesis of BSDL by transfected CHO cells. CHO ldlD-6B transfected cells, grown under non-permissive conditions (▪, 0.57 FCS) or permissive conditions (□, 107 FCS) and CHO K1–3B transfected cells (•), were depleted of methionine with Ham's F-12 methionine-free medium for 45 min, pulsed with [35S]methionine for 15 min, and chased for the required time. Cells were then quickly washed with the medium and then with PBS buffer and harvested. Cells were lysed, and 1 ml of lysate was immunoprecipitated with antibodies to rat BSDL and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Bands migrating at 75 kDa and corresponding to BSDL were quantitated by scanning. The dark intensity (pixel) at each time of chase was subtracted from that at time 0, and values thus obtained were plotted with time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The time dependence of the secretion of BSDL was next examined. For this purpose, CHO K1–3B and CHO ldlD-6B cells were pulse-labeled by [35S]methionine and chased for time intervals up to 240 min. Aliquots of cell culture medium were collected and immunoprecipitated. As shown in Fig.3 A, after a pulse of 15 min, BSDL was detected in the culture medium of CHO K1–3B cells after only 5 min of chase. CHO ldlD-6B cells also secreted BSDL; however, the enzyme was detectable by immunoprecipitation after a 30-min chase. Quantitation of the precipitated material by scanning (Fig.3 B) indicated that the rate of BSDL secretion by CHO K1–3B cells was about 50 times faster than that of CHO ldlD-6B grown under permissive conditions. The latter clone appeared to secrete 4-fold less BSDL when cultured under non-permissive conditions. The time dependence of BSDL secretion by either CHO K1–3B and CHO ldlD-6B cells was also determined from the enzyme activity recorded in culture medium. For this purpose, CHO K1–3B and CHO ldlD-6B cells were washed in PBS and incubated with fresh medium. At time intervals up to 4 h, aliquots of the medium were collected and assayed for BSDL activity. The activity of BSDL increased with time in the culture medium of both cell lines, but the rate of BSDL secretion by CHO K1–3B cells (36.6 ± 1.3 milliunits/h/mg of cell protein) was approximately 30 times higher than that of CHO ldlD-6B cells grown under permissive conditions (1.2 ± 0.2 milliunits/h/mg of cell protein). Additionally, as above, and consistent with the estimates made by scanning, the rate of secretion was approximately 5-fold slower (0.22 milliunits/h/mg of cell protein) when CHO ldlD-6B cells were cultured under non-permissive conditions. These data showed that, even though the rates of BSDL translation in CHO K1–3B and CHO ldlD-6B clones were similar, the rate of secretion of the enzyme significantly differed between these clones. Overall, the rate of BSDL secretion by CHO ldlD-6B cells was dependent upon the culture, permissive versus non-permissive, conditions. Taken together, these data suggested that post-translational modification of BSDL by O-glycosylation could regulate the rate at which the enzyme is secreted. As shown above, the rate of BSDL synthesis, which reflects the abundance of BSDL mRNA in each clone, was independent of the culture conditions. Nevertheless, the rate of secretion of the enzyme by CHO ldlD cells clearly depends upon culture conditions. Therefore, it was tempting to address the question of whether, in CHO ldlD cells grown under non-permissive conditions, BSDL was partly subjected to intracellular degradation. The CHO ldlD-6B cells grown to confluence, were pulsed for 30 min with [35S]methionine. After a 3-h chase, cell culture medium and cell lysate were immunoprecipitated. The CHO K1–3B cells were pulsed for 5 min and chased for 20 min before immunoprecipitation. The immunoprecipitated material was then separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed. The material immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate and culture medium of CHO K1–3B cells (data not shown) displayed an electrophoretic migration corresponding to a doublet at 72–75 kDa, compatible with the M r of the rat BSDL (9Abouakil N.

https://openalex.org/W2011239067,"The Ku protein has a critical function in the repair of double-strand DNA breaks induced for example by ionizing radiation or during VDJ recombination. Ku serves as the DNA-binding subunit of the DNA-dependent kinase and is a heterodimeric protein composed of 80- and 70-kDa subunits. We used the two-hybrid system to analyze the interaction domains of the Ku subunits and to identify possible additional partners for Ku. Screening a human cDNA library with the Ku heterodimer did not reveal any novel partners. Screening with the individual subunits, we detected only Ku70 clones interacting with Ku80 and only Ku80 clones interacting with Ku70, indicating that these are the primary partners for one another. Ku80 and Ku70 formed only heterodimers and did not homodimerize. Ku80 was restricted to interacting with just one Ku70 molecule at a time. The minimal functional interaction domain of Ku80 that interacted with Ku70 was defined. It consisted of a 28-amino acid region extending from amino acid 449 to 477. This region was crucial for interaction with Ku70, since mutation within this critical site at amino acids 453 and 454 abrogated the ability to interact with Ku70. We furthermore verified that the same region is crucial for interaction with Ku70 using in vitro co-translation of both subunits followed by an immunoprecipitation with anti-Ku70 antibodies.

This interaction domain of Ku80 does not contain any motif previously recognized in protein-protein interactions. The Ku protein was originally identified as a major autoantigen in patients with autoimmune diseases such as scleroderma-polymyositis (1Mimori T. Akizuki M. Yamagata H. Inada S. Yoshida S. Homma M. J. Clin. Invest. 1981; 68: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Ku is predominantly localized in the nucleus. It consists of two subunits (70 and 80 kDa) and binds to DNA ends in vitro. These double-stranded DNA ends can be blunt or 5′- or 3′-protruding (2Rathmell W.K. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7623-7627Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar,3Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10375-10379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Ku heterodimer is in turn a component of a larger complex, DNA-PK, 1The abbreviations used are: DNA-PK, DNA-protein kinase; SCID, severe combined immunodeficient; aa, amino acid(s); DNA-PKcs, DNA-PK catalytic subunit. serving as the DNA binding subunit that enables the kinase subunit, DNA-PKcs, to be activated by double-stranded DNA breaks (4Dvir A.

The DNA-PK phosphorylates (in vitro) a number of known substrates, including the tumor suppressor gene p53, RNA polymerase II, transcription factor Sp1, or Ku itself (4Dvir A. Peterson S.R.

Biol. 1990; 10: 6472-6481Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). However, their roles in double-stranded break repair are not yet known. Recently c-abl has been identified as a relevant in vivo substrate for DNA-PK (41Kharbanda S. Pandey P. Jin S. Inoue S. Bharti A. Yuan Z.M. Weichselbaum R. Weaver D. Kufe D. Nature. 1997; 386: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Double-stranded breaks occur in the genome at random sites after ionizing radiation or at specific gene sequences during VDJ recombination of T cell receptor and Ig genes. During VDJ recombination, diverse gene elements that encode different parts of T cell receptor and Ig genes are recombined. Thus, the enormous repertoire of the immune system is created (for a review, see Ref. 13Weaver D.T. Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 29-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mice that have a spontaneous mutation in the DNA-PKcs are known as 舠severe combined immunodeficient舡 (SCID) mice. Mice that are deficient in Ku80 have been generated by targeted disruption of the Ku80 gene (14Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da CostaSoares V. Sanchez M. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M.C. Li G.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 15.86, 379–389Zhu, C., Bogue, M. A., Lim, D. S., Hasty, P., and Roth, D. B. (1996) 86, 379–389.Google Scholar). As expected, cells from either Ku80−/− or SCID mice are extremely sensitive to ionizing radiation and fail to rearrange T cell receptor or Ig genes. However, there are differences in the phenotype of the Ku80−/− or SCID mice (14Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da CostaSoares V. Sanchez M. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M.C. Li G.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 15.86, 379–389Zhu, C., Bogue, M. A., Lim, D. S., Hasty, P., and Roth, D. B. (1996) 86, 379–389.Google Scholar, 16Roth D.B. Menetski J.P. Nakajima P.B. Bosma M.J. Gellert M. Cell. 1992; 70: 983-991Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). For example Ku80−/− mice show general growth retardation, and embryonic fibroblasts can only be passaged a few times in vitro, suggesting a role for Ku in senescence (14Nussenzweig A. Chen C. da CostaSoares V. Sanchez M. Sokol K. Nussenzweig M.C. Li G.C. Nature. 1996; 382: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The greater severity of the Ku-deficient phenotype could be due to other Ku functions that do not involve the DNA-PKcs or due to the fact that the SCID mouse retains some residual catalytic function, since it is not a null mutation in the DNA-PKcs. Thus, although Ku is necessary for certain aspects of genome integrity, its precise role has not yet been defined. A number of questions are unanswered. Does the Ku dimer interact with kinases other than the DNA-PKcs? Does Ku interact with other proteins to align broken DNA ends? Does Ku anchor broken DNA ends to the nuclear skeleton, thus stabilizing them? Is there a family of Ku homologues (17Griffith A.J. Craft J. Evans J. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 16: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)? Are there related proteins forming heterodimers with either Ku subunit via the leucine zipper described for both Ku subunits (18Yaneva M. Wen J. Ayala A. Cook R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13407-13411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Reeves W.H. Sthoeger Z.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5047-5052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)? Does one Ku heterodimer interact with another dimer? We hoped to address these questions with a search for Ku-associated proteins by use of the yeast two-hybrid system. We furthermore addressed the question of how the two Ku subunits interact with each other by identifying their minimal regions of interaction. Defining regions for dimerization would be useful in dissecting distinct functions of the Ku protein complex and in generating negative dominant mutants that would allow the study of Ku's function in mammalian cells. The full-length human Ku80 and Ku70 cDNAs in a pBlueBac2 baculovirus expression vector were the kind gift of Dr. J. D. Capra (20Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For studying protein-protein interaction in yeast, the Matchmaker two-hybrid system fromCLONTECH was used (21Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). The full coding sequences of human Ku80 and Ku70 cDNAs were inserted into pGBT9 and pAS2 vectors (22Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5235) Google Scholar) and expressed as fusion proteins to the DNA binding domain of the transcription factor Gal4 (referred to as Ku80-bait and Ku70-bait). Both Ku80 and Ku70 cDNAs were also subcloned into pGAD424 and expressed as fusion proteins to the activation domain of the transcription factor Gal4 (referred to as Ku80-prey and Ku70-prey). For simultaneous expression of both Ku subunits from the same plasmid, we subcloned Ku70 cDNA bounded by ADH promoter and terminator sequences into the SacI site of pAS2-Ku80 as described previously for the expression cassette cyclin D1-Cdk4 (23Toyoshima H. Hunter T. Cell. 1994; 78: 67-74Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1933) Google Scholar). The resulting plasmid expresses Ku80 as a fusion protein to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain as well as full-length Ku70 protein (referred to as Ku80-bait/Ku70). Junctions of all constructs were verified by sequencing. As negative and positive controls, the following vectors were used: the vectors pAS2 or pGAD424 without cDNA insert, p53-bait (encodes p53 fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in pGBT9), LTA-prey (encodes SV40 large T antigen fused to the Gal4 activation domain in pGAD3F), and lamin C-prey (encodes lamin C fused to the Gal4 DNA-binding domain in pGBT9). Ku80 and Ku70 deletion mutants were obtained by subcloning of polymerase chain reaction products into pGBT9. Proofreading Pfu thermostable DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. All polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to have BamHI sites on the 5′-end and a SalI site on the 3′-end. Functional analysis of multiple clones was performed after junctions had been sequenced by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method. Plasmid Ku70-(377–609) was generated by subcloning anEco36II-SalI fragment from the full-length clone into pAS2. Several deletion mutants of Ku80 were found screening the library with full-length Ku70 as bait, the shortest being Ku80-(449–732). Deletion mutant Ku70-(194–609) was found screening the library using full-length Ku80 as bait. For library screening and measurement of protein interaction, plasmids were transformed by lithium acetate transfection (24Schliestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar) into the yeast strains Y190 (MATa, ura3–52,his3–200,lys2–801,ade2–101,trp1–901, leu2–3,112,gal4d,gal80d,cyhr2,LYS2::GAL1UAS-HIS3TATA-HIS3, URA3::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ) or CG-1945 (MATa,ura3–52,his3– 200,lys2–801,ade2–101,trp1–901,leu2–3,112,gal4–542,gal80–538,cyhr2,LYS2::GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-HIS3,URA3::GAL417-mers(× 3)CyC1TATAlacZ) (22Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5235) Google Scholar). The strains contain the reporter genes lacZ andhis3 under the control of Gal4-responsive promoters. Transfected clones were selected in media lacking tryptophan and leucine. To verify the interaction between the expressed proteins, transformants were selected on media lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine in the presence of the drug 3-aminotriazol (Sigma), which suppresses background reporter activity and thus background growth. Ku subunit interactions were tested in a wide range of 3-aminotriazol from 2.5 to 12.5 mm in CG-1945 and 12.5 to 80 mm in Y190. Positive interaction was only scored when cells met both the criteria of growth and ॆ-galactosidase activity. ॆ-Galactosidase activity was measured as described elsewhere (25Breeden L. Nasmyth K. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1985; 50: 643-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Yeast colonies positive for growth on selective media were transferred onto Whatman No. 3MM filters, permeabilized in liquid nitrogen, and after thawing at room temperature soaked in LacZ-X-gal solution (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgSO4, 1 mm 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl ॆ-d-galactopyranoside). Color development occurred in a period from 2 to 5 h at 30 °C. It was scored positive, +, if it was comparable in intensity with positive controls (such as p53-large T antigen interaction). It was scored weak positive, (+), when the color developed within 2–5 h but was less intense than the positive control (such as p53-large T antigen). A negative was scored when color failed to develop within 12 h. For library screening, yeast Y190 was transfected with bait plasmid and selected on media lacking tryptophan. Successfully transformed yeast was further transfected with human thymus cDNA library in pGAD10 (from CLONTECH) or HeLa cDNA in pGAD-GH (from Invitrogen). Baits included Ku80-bait, Ku70-bait, or Ku80-bait/Ku70. From 1 × 106to 2 × 106 clones were analyzed with each bait plasmid. Transformed yeast were selected on media SC (26Rose M.D. Winston F. Hieter P. Methods in Genetics: A Laboratory Course Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1990Google Scholar) lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine in the presence of 30 mm3-aminotriazol (Sigma). Positive clones were additionally tested for ॆ-galactosidase. Loss of the Ku-bait was determined by streaking yeast on selective plates lacking leucine with 2.5 mg/ml cycloheximide. Plasmid loss was verified by inability of resulting colonies to grow on media lacking leucine and tryptophan. Clones were additionally verified for the absence of autonomous activation of transcription fromhis3 and lacZ reporter genes. Total DNA from yeast was prepared as described (27Kaiser P. Auer B. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 552PubMed Google Scholar). For plasmid recovery, DNA was transformed into a competent HB101 strain of Escherichia coli (Life Technologies, Inc.). TheBamHI-SalI-digested fragment of Ku70 cDNA and respective Ku80 fragments were subcloned into theBamHI-XhoI site of pCDNA3.1-HisA. Thus, the cDNA can be expressed in vitro under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Constructs were used in the coupledin vitro transcription and translation reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). During translation, the products were labeled with [35S]methionine (Easy-TagTM, NEN Life Science Products). Radiolabeled in vitrotranslation products were immunoprecipitated with anti-human Ku70 antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Single or co-translated products or immunoprecipitated products were subsequently separated on a 7.57 SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried and exposed overnight. To obtain specific substitution of amino acid residues, the Chameleon double-stranded site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Five 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides were synthesized with the following sequences (asterisks indicate mutated positions): 442*443*, 5′-TCCTTGAAAAACAGTGAAGAATATGCTCCCACC-3′; 453*454*, 5′-GCACAGTTGAATCACCACGATGCTTTGATTGACTCC-3′; 471*472*, 5′-GATGAGAAGACAGGCCCCCTTGAAGACTTG-3′; 483*484*485*, 5′-CCAACCACCAAAATCCTAACTCTTCGATTTCAGAG-3′;506*507*, 5′-CGGGAGCCTCTACGCGAATTCAGCAGC-3′. Each mutant introduced two or three (483*484*485*) point mutations of adjacent amino acids. Introduction of point mutations was verified by sequencing. To define association of the Ku subunits with each other or with other proteins, we used the yeast two-hybrid system. Full-length cDNA for human Ku80 or Ku70 was subcloned into the yeast vector pAS2 (referred to as 舠bait舡) that expressed the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor Gal4. The reporter gene expressed either thelacZ or the his3 gene under the control of a Gal4-dependent promoter. Reporter activity was measured as ॆ-galactosidase activity as well as growth in histidine lacking medium. To suppress basal promoter activity, a wide range of 3-aminotriazol concentrations was used during selection. Ku80 had been reported as a transcriptional activator of a number of mammalian genes (28Messier H. Fuller T. Mangal S. Brickner H. Igarashi S. Gaikwad J. Fotedar R. Fotedar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This indicates that neither full-length Ku80 nor Ku70 has detectable transcriptional activity on their own in our experimental approach (Table I).Table IInteraction of full-length Ku80 and Ku70 subunitsProteins fused to the transcriptional activation domain (prey)Proteins fused to the DNA-binding domain (bait)Control1-bVector without cDNA insert: bait, pAS2; prey, pGAD424.Ku80Ku70Ku80/Ku701-aKu80 is fused to the DNA-binding domain.

Full-length Ku80 and Ku70 were also subcloned in the yeast vector pGAD424 (referred to as Ku80-prey or Ku70-prey) that expresses the transcriptional activation domain of Gal4. Neither plasmid showed reporter activity on their own. This indicates that neither Ku80 nor Ku70 shows nonspecific binding to DNA sequences allowing promoter activation. These results enabled us to use the yeast two-hybrid system to study the interaction of the Ku units. As expected, Ku80-bait and Ku70-prey showed detectable protein-protein interaction and vice versa (Table I). The interaction was comparable with the positive controls p53/SV40 large T antigen (TableI) or cyclin D/Cdk4 (not shown). Neither of the single Ku subunits interacted with negative controls including lamin C, large T antigen, or p53 (Table I). It has been suggested that the Ku subunits form homodimers, particularly the Ku80 subunit (32Griffith A.J. Blier P.R. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 331-338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the formation of Ku70 homodimers could explain how Ku70 shows some DNA binding properties on its own (33Abu-Elheiga L. Yaneva M. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1992; 64: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 34Wang J. Satoh M. Pierani A. Schmitt J. Chou C.H. Stunnenberg H.G. Roeder R.G. Reeves W.H. J. Cell. Sci. 1994; 107: 3223-3233PubMed Google Scholar, 35Chou C.H. Wang J. Knuth M.W. Reeves W.H. J. Ex. Med. 1992; 175: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Ku70 homodimers could also possibly protect the broken signal ends in Ku80−/− mice (15.86, 379–389Zhu, C., Bogue, M. A., Lim, D. S., Hasty, P., and Roth, D. B. (1996) 86, 379–389.Google Scholar). However, Ku70-bait and Ku70-prey showed no detectable interaction. Thus, there was no evidence for homodimerization of Ku70 (Table I). There was also no evidence for Ku80 homodimerization as shown. Since the Ku heterodimer binds to broken DNA ends, it appeared possible that two heterodimers would interact with each other. This would permit the joining or stabilization of the two broken DNA ends. To examine this possibility, we inserted an expression cassette with full-length Ku70 into the vector Ku80-bait (referred to as Ku80-bait/Ku70). This allowed co-expression of Ku80 DNA-binding fusion protein and Ku70 from the same plasmid. Co-transfection of the double expressing plasmid Ku80-bait/Ku70 with Ku80-prey showed no reporter activation (Table I). This indicated that Ku70 cannot interact with more than one Ku80 molecule simultaneously. Thus, there is no evidence in the yeast two-hybrid system that two Ku heterodimers can bind to each other and thus bring for example two broken DNA ends together. Ku70-prey was also co-transfected with the double expressing plasmid Ku80-bait/Ku70. Less reporter activity was observed than with the simple combination Ku70-prey and Ku80-bait (Table I). This is likely to be explained by competition between Ku70 and Ku70-prey for binding to Ku80-bait, thus reducing reporter activation. In summary, the Ku subunits Ku80 and Ku70 interact in the yeast two-hybrid system as heterodimers but not as homodimers or heterotrimers. To identify additional Ku-associated proteins, Ku80-bait was used to screen a HeLa cell library. About 1 million clones were screened, but only full-length Ku70 and deletional mutants of Ku70 were identified. When Ku70-bait was used for screening, only full-length Ku80 and deletional mutants of Ku80 were isolated as prey. The deletional mutants are discussed below. Thus, it appears that only Ku70 is the predominant partner for Ku80 andvice versa. Furthermore, the screening confirms the above observation that neither Ku80 nor Ku70 form homodimers, only heterodimers. Hypothetical Ku-interactive proteins might bind to the heterodimer but not to the individual Ku chains. We therefore screened the library with the Ku heterodimer using the Ku80-bait/Ku70 double expression plasmid as bait. After screening about 1 million clones, the only interactive clones found were identified as full-length Ku70. The HeLa library might be missing Ku-associated proteins that are involved in VDJ recombination. Since VDJ recombination is unique to lymphoid precursors, we screened a thymus library with the Ku80-bait/Ku70 heterodimer. No specific interaction products were identified. Moreover, no DNA-PKcs clones were detected in any screen. This probably indicates the technical limits of the yeast two-hybrid system, as discussed below. A number of potential functional domains have been identified in Ku80 based on sequence homology (17Griffith A.J. Craft J. Evans J. Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1992; 16: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 18Yaneva M. Wen J. Ayala A. Cook R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13407-13411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Reeves W.H.

Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1777-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). These include leucine zipper-like domains that could promote protein-protein interaction as well as clusters of basic amino acid domains that could be involved in DNA recognition. To delineate the regions of Ku80 that are necessary for heterodimerization, we constructed truncation mutants of Ku80. In addition we characterized the N-terminal deletion mutants obtained in screening the library with Ku70-bait. They were expressed as fusion proteins with the DNA-binding domain and tested for transcriptional activation of the reporter gene in the presence or absence of Ku70-prey. Deletion of the 3′-end of Ku80 between aa 477 and 732 still allowed interaction with full-length Ku70 (Fig.1). Further deletion between aa 401 and 477 abolished the activation of the reporter gene. Thus, the region upstream of aa 477 is important for interaction with Ku70. Deletion of the 5′-region from aa 1 to 448 was dispensable for interaction with full-length Ku70. Thus, the two minimal deletional Ku80 mutants that still show interaction with Ku70 cover the region from aa 1 to 477 or the region from aa 449 to 732. These Ku80 mutants overlap in the region from aa 449 to 477, suggesting a minimal domain of only 28 aa that is important for dimerization with Ku70. However, expression of the minimal region comprising aa 427–477 showed transcriptional activity on its own, which will be discussed below. A Ku80 mutant containing the region between aa 427 and 531 had no transcriptional activity on its own and required the presence of Ku70 for reporter gene activation. Thus, the region of Ku80 tested that is sufficient for interaction with full-length Ku70 comprises aa 427–531. Within this region, the stretch from aa 449 to 477 of Ku80 is probably most important for heterodimerization. The minimal critical region that has been identified in Ku80 may be sufficient for interaction with Ku70 but not necessary. It is possible that additional sites could substitute for the minimal region. Thus point mutants of Ku80 were created to determine whether regions of importance are indeed crucial for interaction with Ku70. Four mutation sites were created in Ku80; two were located within the minimal region of aa 449 and 477 (Fig.2). Each mutation site exchanged two adjacent amino acids for ones of different charge; e.g. aa 453* and 454* were changed from neutral to basic, and aa 471* was changed from acid to neutral. Two other mutation sites that were adjacent to the minimal region contained proline 舠kinks舡 that were removed upon mutation. The point mutants were first tested in the deletion construct stretching from aa 427 to 732. Of all these mutants, only point mutant, aa 453*454*, became unable to induce reporter gene activation and thus lost the ability to interact with full-length Ku70 (Fig. 2). To test whether these amino acids at position 453/454 were also crucial in the full-length protein, we introduced the same mutations into the wild type Ku80. Again, only point mutant aa 453*454* was abrogating the interaction with Ku70. Thus, the site around aa 453/454 located in the minimal region aa 449–477, is necessary for heterodimerization with Ku70. To confirm that binding of Ku80 to Ku70 was indeed dependent on the minimal region identified in Ku80, we used an in vitrobinding assay. Various mutants of Ku8"

Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). The protein substrate cysteine residue is located within a C-terminal motif called a CAAX box in which C is the cysteine that is S-farnesylated, A is often an aliphatic amino acid, and X is methionine, serine, glutamine, cysteine, or alanine (1Reiss Y.

S-Farnesylation is the first step by which a number of proteins, including all forms of the Ras proto-oncoprotein, are post-translationally lipid-modified, facilitating membrane association and in some cases protein-protein interaction (2Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). Membrane association is required for Ras function, thus inhibitors of FTase have been proposed as antitumor agents (5Gibbs J.B. Oliff A. Kohl N.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 175-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). FTase inhibitors (FTIs) have been shown to inhibit anchorage-independent growth of ras-transformed rodent fibroblasts and human tumor cell lines (6Nagasu T. Yoshimatsu K. Rowill C.

FTase kinetically proceeds through an ordered, sequential mechanism in which FPP is the first substrate bound (10Pompliano D.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Omer C.A. Shafer J.A. Gibbs J.B.

Recent spectral data indicate that upon formation of the FTase·FPP·CAAX ternary complex, the cysteine thiol of the CAAX sequence interacts directly with Zn2+, possibly forming a thiolate anion (14Huang C.-C. Casey P.J. Fierke C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In addition to the enzyme-bound Zn2+, FTase activity requires millimolar Mg2+ (12Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two additional prenyl:protein transferases (PTases) have been described that catalyze reactions similar to that of FTase. Geranylgeranyl:protein transferase type I (GGTase-I) geranylgeranylates protein substrates with a C-terminal CAAX motif in whichX is usually leucine (3Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E.

The catalytic moiety of all PTases purified to date are αॆ heterodimers, although GGTase-II requires a third subunit for protein substrate presentation (15Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

The α-subunits of FTase and GGTase-I are identical and show similarity to the corresponding subunit of GGTase-II (19Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

The ॆ-subunits for each of these enzymes are distinct, but have overall amino acid similarity of approximately 307 (20Zhang F.L. Diehl R.E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Giros B. Casey P.J. Omer C.A. J. Biol.

In cross-linking studies, substrate proteins and photoactivatable analogs of FPP and CAAX peptides have been shown to bind to the ॆ-subunit of FTase (18Reiss Y. Seabra M.C. Armstrong S.A.

Chem. 1994; 269: 470-477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, photoactivatable geranylgeranyl diphosphate analogs can be cross-linked to the ॆ-subunit of GGTase-I (24Bukhtiyarov Y.E. Omer C.A. Allen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19035-19040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 25Yokoyama K. McGeady P. Gelb M.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 1344-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The recently published x-ray crystal structure of rat FTase (>937 amino acid sequence identity to human FTase) identified three conserved amino acids of the ॆ-subunit as ligands for the essential Zn2+ ion (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Thus the ॆ-subunit appears to play key roles in substrate binding and presumably in catalysis. In this communication we have examined the role of the human FTase ॆ-subunit by analyzing site-directed mutants of amino acids Arg-202, His-248, Cys-254, Arg-291, Lys-294, Asp-297, Cys-299, Tyr-300, Trp-303, Asp-359, and His-362. These residues are conserved among the ॆ-subunits of all PTase enzymes identified to date and are near the essential Zn2+ ion in rat FTase (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). We present biochemical evidence indicating the involvement of these amino acids in substrate interaction, zinc binding, and catalysis. Utilizing these results and the rat FTase crystal structure, we propose that ॆ-subunit residues Arg-291, Lys-294, Trp-303, and possibly His-248 are involved in FPP binding. Our data suggest that ॆ-subunit residue Arg-202 interacts with the C-terminal carboxylate of the CAAX substrate. We confirm that ॆ-subunit residues Asp-297, Cys-299, and His-362 are Zn2+ ligands and present data indicating that Asp-359 may also have an effect on Zn2+ binding. The protein substrate used in this study wasSaccharomyces cerevisiae Ras1 [Leu-68](term)-SLKCVLS and is referred to as Ras-CVLS (3Moores S.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Rands E. O'Hara M.B. Garsky V.M.

ENTENSIFYTM and [3H]FPP (22.5 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeled FPP was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. (St. Louis, MO). The biotinylation kit, neutral density scintillation proximity assay (SPA) streptavidin beads, and65ZnCl2 (10.3 Ci/mmol) were purchased from Amersham. Bradford protein determination reagents and Bio-Spin-6 columns were acquired from Bio-Rad. 67 polyacrylamide gels (7 × 8 × 0.1 cm) in 89 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 0.1 mm EDTA (TBE) were purchased from Novex (San Diego, CA). X-ray film (X-Omat AR) was obtained from Kodak. Wild type human FTase was expressed from pRD517 in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). pRD517 is similar to pFPTase-ॆαopt1 (22Omer C.A. Kral A.M. Diehl R.E. Prendergast G.C. Powers S. Allen C.M. Gibbs J.B. Kohl N.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) except that it has a bacteriophage T7 promoter driving expression of the two subunits of FTase. The coding sequences for the ॆ- and α-subunits of human FTase were cloned in tandem into BamHI + HindIII cleaved pT5T downstream of the T7 promoter (27Eisenberg S.P. Evans R.J. Arend W.P. Verderber E. Brewer M.T. Hannum C.H. Thompson R.C. Nature. 1990; 343: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). The sequence of the insert is shown in Sequence 1. Recombinant, human FTase made from this strain has the epitope Glu-Glu-Phe attached to the C terminus of the ॆ-subunit to facilitate purification (22Omer C.A. Kral A.M. Diehl R.E. Prendergast G.C. Powers S. Allen C.M. Gibbs J.B. Kohl N.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5167-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutations were introduced into pRD517 using the polymerase chain reaction (28Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, San Diego1990: 177-183Google Scholar). Mutationally silent restriction endonuclease sites were also introduced during the mutagenesis enabling us to screen clones for the presence of the new site. The amino acid changes made are abbreviated using the following notation. 舠ॆR202A舡 indicates that ॆ-subunit residue arginine 202 was changed to alanine. The corresponding heterodimeric human FTase is 舠αॆR202A.舡 All mutated regions were sequenced to ensure that only the intended changes were made. Bacterial growth and induction of FTase synthesis with isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside was performed as described (29Omer C.A. Diehl R.E. Kral A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Purification of the recombinant FTases was similar to that described previously (29Omer C.A. Diehl R.E. Kral A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 250: 3-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli were lysed by sonication, and the debris was pelleted. The soluble protein was applied to a YL1/2 antibody column to bind to the Glu-Glu-Phe C-terminal epitope on the FTase ॆ-subunit. Specifically bound protein was eluted at neutral pH with 5 mm Asp-Phe (Sigma). Approximately a 10-fold molar excess of ZnCl2 was added to the enzyme before final purification by chromatography on Mono Q (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). FTase was the only major absorbance (A 280 nm) peak seen eluting from the Mono Q column. The final enzyme preparations were >707 pure as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent Coomassie Blue staining. Since this purification method does not require following the enzyme activity, we could isolate mutant enzymes with little residual catalytic activity. FTase activity was assayed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 10 ॖm ZnCl2, 0.17 (w/v) polyethylene glycol (average M r 20,000) with [3H]FPP (1–3000 nm) and Ras-CVLS protein (5–300,000 nm) as substrates as described (30Pompliano D.L.

Steady-state kinetic parameters were calculated using the nonlinear analysis program k·CAT (Europa Scientific Software Corp., Hollis, NH) assuming a molecular mass of 93 kDa for FTase and 21 kDa for Ras-CVLS. The dissociation constant for FPP was measured in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 10 ॖmZnCl2, 0.27 (w/v)N-octyl-ॆ-d-glucopyranoside utilizing a SPA (31Nelson N. Anal.

FTase was biotinylated using a biotinylation kit as described by the manufacturer. Biotinylated FTase (2–10 nm) was incubated with [3H]FPP (0.27–1640 nm) and 5 ॖg of neutral density streptavidin SPA beads for 30 min at room temperature after which the bound substrate was measured in a TopCount scintillation counter (Packard Instrument Co.). Scatchard plots (boundversus bound/free) of the resultant data were employed to determine the apparent K d [K d (app)] values using the program k·CAT. Zinc binding to FTase was analyzed using a modification of the method of Fu et al. (33Fu H.-W. Moomaw J.F. Moomaw C.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28541-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). 20 ॖg of FTase in 100 ॖl of buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, 100 mm NaCl, and 25 ॖm EDTA) was incubated at 30 °C for 1 h and then overnight on ice to deplete the enzyme of bound Zn2+. The Zn2+-depleted FTase was buffer-exchanged into buffer B (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 ॖm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) using Bio-Spin-6 columns, and the protein concentration of the eluate was determined. 3.6 ॖg of FTase was brought up to 18 ॖl in buffer B, and 3 ॖl of 143 ॖm ZnCl2 (either unlabeled ZnCl2 in 0.1 n HCl or65ZnCl2) was added, and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 3 h and then on ice overnight. Two ॖl of 220 ॖm FPP was added to the samples containing labeled 65ZnCl2, and 2 ॖl of 22 ॖm [3H]FPP was added to those containing unlabeled ZnCl2. After incubating at room temperature for 15 min, the samples were electrophoresed in nondenaturing 67 polyacrylamide gels using TBE as running buffer. After electrophoresis the gels were either washed 15–30 min in TBE running buffer (65ZnCl2 samples) or soaked in ENTENSIFYTM (samples containing [3H]farnesyl diphosphate). The gels were dried between cellulose sheets and exposed to x-ray film. Alignment of the ॆ-subunits of PTases from various species identified a number of conserved amino acids (Fig. 1). Here we present the investigation of 11 conserved residues whose side chains contained aromatic rings or heteroatoms (TableI). These included residues that were shown to be near the essential Zn2+ ion in the recently published crystal structure of rat FTase (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). To analyze the function of these amino acids, each was individually changed to alanine. Alanine was chosen because it has a small side chain and generally does not affect the secondary structure of a protein. E. coliexpression strains were made for these mutated FTases. All except αॆY300A were expressed at levels similar to wild type enzyme and upon purification were found to be αॆ heterodimers (data not shown). Further analysis of αॆY300A FTase suggested that this enzyme was unstable; therefore, in its place we made αॆY300F which was expressed well and was stable. We purified the 11 mutant FTases and have biochemically characterized them to elucidate the potential role(s) of these residues.Table IBiochemical properties of mutant human FTasesEnzymeK m (Ras-CVLS)K m (FPP)k CATRelativek CATK d (FPP)nm ± S.E.nm ± S.E.mol FPP/mol FTase/s ± S.E.nm ± S.E.Wild type αॆ360 ± 3011 ± 11.4 ± 0.3 × 10−213.3 ± 0.4αॆR202A170,000 ± 40,0004.1 ± 0.26.4 ± 1.3 × 10−30.463.0 ± 0.65αॆH248A570 ± 6094 ± 381.5 ± 0.3 × 10−21.119 ± 2αॆC254A470 ± 2015 ± 23.3 ± 0.6 × 10−22.46.2 ± 0.9αॆR291A2900 ± 600400 ± 301.0 ± 0.2 × 10−17.146 ± 4αॆK294A2000 ± 200410 ± 304.2 ± 0.4 × 10−2343 ± 6αॆD297A2500 ± 4005.9 ± 1.22.3 ± 0.4 × 10−40.0163.1 ± 0.5αॆC299AND1-aND, not determined.ND1.0 ± 0.2 × 10−51-bFor αॆC299A the specific activity determined using 400 nm FPP and 4000 nm Ras-CVLS is indicated.0.000931-bFor αॆC299A the specific activity determined using 400 nm FPP and 4000 nm Ras-CVLS is indicated.4.9 ± 1.3αॆY300F190 ± 307.2 ± 1.92.9 ± 0.7 × 10−30.2110 ± 1αॆW303A3800 ± 500210 ± 302.8 ± 0.4 × 10−22.017 ± 3αॆD359A2200 ± 4005.8 ± 1.71.6 ± 0.2 × 10−30.115.7 ± 0.6αॆH362A2900 ± 4008.1 ± 1.21.5 ± 0.2 × 10−30.113.0 ± 0.7The kinetic parameters were determined as described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡 (n = 3–20).1-a ND, not determined.1-b For αॆC299A the specific activity determined using 400 nm FPP and 4000 nm Ras-CVLS is indicated. Open table in a new tab The kinetic parameters were determined as described under 舠Experimental Procedures舡 (n = 3–20). Kinetic parameters (K m FPP,K m Ras-CVLS, andk CAT) and the apparent dissociation constant for FPP (FPP K d (app)) for each enzyme were determined (Table I). Catalytic activity (k CAT) of 5 of the 11 mutant human FTases was deficient relative to wild type enzyme. FTase αॆC299A was nearly inactive, whereas the catalytic activities of αॆD297A, αॆY300F, αॆD359A, and αॆH362A were 5–100-fold lower than that of wild type FTase. Catalytic activities of the other mutant FTases were similar or somewhat higher than for wild type enzyme. The crystal structure of rat FTase shows that amino acids Asp-ॆ297, Cys-ॆ299, and His-ॆ362 are ligands for the essential Zn2+ ion; thus mutations in these residues would be expected to inhibit enzyme activity (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The protein substrateK m values for αॆD297A and αॆH362A were elevated approximately 7–8-fold relative to wild type FTase, but the FPP K m and K d (app)values were similar to wild type (Table I). αॆC299A was too inactive for K m value determinations. Another catalytically deficient mutant FTase, αॆD359A, was also found to have a similarly elevated protein substrate K m and wild type FPP K m and FPPK d (app) values. Mutations of ॆ-subunit residues Arg-291, Lys-294, or Trp-303 increased the K m values for both protein and prenyl substrates and the FPP K d (app), but did not lower the catalytic activity of these enzymes (Table I). In fact all three mutant enzymes had somewhat elevatedk CAT values with the k CATvalue for αॆR291A being approximately 7-fold higher than wild type FTase. Enzymatic analysis of another mutant, αॆH248A, suggested that it may have a defect in FPP binding and K m, but a near-normal protein substrate K m. Mutant FTase αॆR202A was found to have a greatly (>400-fold) elevated K m for Ras-CVLS. The FPPK m, FPP K d (app) andk CAT values for αॆR202A were similar to wild type FTase. FTase αॆY300F had a slightly (∼5-fold) decreasedk CAT. The final mutant FTase examined, αॆC254A, showed no obvious defects in the measured parameters. FTase tightly binds a single Zn2+ ion that is essential for activity (12Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Chen W.-J. Moomaw J.F. Overton L. Kost T.A. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9675-9680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typical amino acid ligands for Zn2+ include Asp, Glu, His, and Cys. We tested nine of the mutant enzymes for binding to radioactive 65Zn2+ using a native gel system described previously (33Fu H.-W. Moomaw J.F. Moomaw C.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28541-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The mutants tested included all 6 in which His, Cys, and Asp had been mutated (no Glu residues were mutated). As a control for enzyme integrity, we also examined, in parallel, [3H]FPP binding in the same gel system. The results indicated that four of the mutant FTases, αॆD297A, αॆC299A, αॆD359A, and αॆH362A, were defective in Zn2+binding but retained the ability to bind [3H]FPP (Fig.2). Three of these amino acids, Asp-ॆ297, Cys-ॆ299, and His-ॆ362, appear as ligands in the crystal structure of rat FTase (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), with Cys-ॆ299 of rat FTase previously being shown to be a Zn2+ ligand by biochemical and molecular techniques (33Fu H.-W. Moomaw J.F. Moomaw C.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28541-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Asp-ॆ359, although near the Zn2+ ion, did not appear to be a ligand in the rat FTase structure. The kinetic parameters shown in Table I were determined in the presence of 10 ॖm ZnCl2, thus mutant FTases that have a Zn2+ binding defect may have had that defect partially masked. Since the method used to purify mutant and wild type FTases involved adding excess ZnCl2 to the enzyme preparation before the final ion exchange step, enzymes that tightly bound Zn2+ should have retained this metal ion and not require added Zn2+ for activity. We, therefore, assayed the enzyme activity of wild type and several mutant FTases adding either 100 ॖm EDTA (−ZnCl2), to scavenge residual free Zn2+, or 10 ॖm ZnCl2(+ZnCl2). FTase αॆC299A was not tested since it is essentially inactive even in the presence of added ZnCl2(Table I). The catalytic rates of wild type, αॆH248A, and αॆC254A FTases were found to be independent of added ZnCl2 (Table II). The activity of mutant FTases αॆD297A, αॆD359A, and αॆH362A, however, showed 10-fold or greater dependence on exogenously added ZnCl2, with the activity in the absence of ZnCl2 being at the limit of detection (∼10−5mol of FPP incorporated/mol of FTase/s).Table IIZn2+ dependence of wild type and mutant FTase activityFTaseActivity −ZnCl2Activity +ZnCl2mol FPP/mol FTase/s ± S.E.Wild type1.0 ± 0.1 × 10−29.1 ± 1.0 × 10−3αॆH248A9.1 ± 0.5 × 10−31.1 ± 0.1 × 10−2αॆC254A2.1 ± 0.2 × 10−22.5 ± 0.3 × 10−2αॆD297A1.2 ± 0.4 × 10−51.3 ± 0.1 × 10−4αॆD359A2.2 ± 0.6 × 10−51.4 ± 0.2 × 10−3αॆH362A2.7 ± 0.4 × 10−51.4 ± 0.2 × 10−3Wild type and mutant (αॆH248A, αॆC254A, αॆD297A, αॆD359A, αॆH362A) FTases were assayed for enzymatic activity at 30 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.17 (w/v) polyethylene glycol (average M r 20,000) plus either 100 ॖmEDTA (−ZnCl2) or 100 ॖm ZnCl2(+ZnCl2). Substrates were used at 5–10 times theK m value for [3H]FPP and atK m for Ras-CVLS. Reactions were run in triplicate, and time points were taken at 3–6 min intervals to determine the rate of [3H]FPP incorporation. Open table in a new tab Wild type and mutant (αॆH248A, αॆC254A, αॆD297A, αॆD359A, αॆH362A) FTases were assayed for enzymatic activity at 30 °C in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.17 (w/v) polyethylene glycol (average M r 20,000) plus either 100 ॖmEDTA (−ZnCl2) or 100 ॖm ZnCl2(+ZnCl2). Substrates were used at 5–10 times theK m value for [3H]FPP and atK m for Ras-CVLS. Reactions were run in triplicate, and time points were taken at 3–6 min intervals to determine the rate of [3H]FPP incorporation. FTase αॆR202A was found to have aK m value for Ras-CVLS >400-fold higher than that for wild type FTase with no defect in FPP K m orK d (app) (Table I). An explanation for this may be that the negatively charged carboxylate of the CAAX substrate interacts with the positively charged guanidino side chain of the arginine residue. To test this hypothesis, we looked at the ability of four CAAX-competitive FTase inhibitors (FTI) to inhibit the activity of this mutant enzyme versus wild type (Fig. 3 and Table III). The peptide FTI, CVFM, and the peptidomimetic FTI, L-739,750, both contain a cysteine thiol and a free C-terminal carboxylate. L-739,787 is similar to L-739,750 except that the C-terminal methionine sulfone has been reduced to methioninol. The FTI, L-745,631, is a tripeptide mimetic that contains a free thiol, but no carboxylate. All four inhibitors are members of FTI classes that have been shown to be competitive with the CAAX substrate, but not competitive with FPP (30Pompliano D.L. Rands E. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). IC50 values were determined for the four compounds under K m conditions for the respective enzymes (Table III). Under these conditions, the IC50 values should be approximately twice the K i value for a competitive inhibitor (36Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharm. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12215) Google Scholar). The two carboxylate-containing inhibitors, CVFM and L-739,750, had 100–200-fold higher IC50 values for αॆR202A as compared with wild type FTase. The IC50 value for L-739,787, in which the carboxylate has been reduced to an alcohol, was less than 4-fold higher for αॆR202A as compared with wild type FTase. This indicates, at most, a slight difference in binding of L-739,787 to the two enzymes. The IC50 values for the non-carboxylate FTI, L-745,631, were within 2-fold of one another indicating that it binds to both enzymes with similar affinity. Altogether these data are consistent with Arg-ॆ202 interacting with the free carboxylate of the CAAX competitive FTIs and by inference with the carboxylate of the CAAX substrate.Table IIIInhibition of wild type and αॆR202A FTase by farnesyl transferase inhibitorsFarnesyltransferase inhibitorIC50 wild type ± S.E.IC50 αॆR202A ± S.E.nmCVFM45 ± 911,000 ± 1,000L-739,7503.1 ± 0.5290 ± 20L-739,7871600 ± 3006200 ± 1200L-745,6311.8 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.5Reactions were performed at 30 °C using the buffer conditions described under 舠Experimental Procedures,舡 100 nm[3H]FPP, K m concentrations of Ras-CVLS, 0.5–1.0 nm enzyme, and varying amounts of the following FTIs: CVFM, L-739,750, L-745,631, and L-739,787.

The IC50values were determined by fitting the data to the equation [y = 100/(1 + (x/IC50)n)] with n = slope of the curve through the IC50. In this communication we have examined the roles of 11 conserved residues of the ॆ-subunit of human FTase. From the crystal structure of the closely related rat FTase, all of these residues are in the vicinity of the essential Zn2+ ion (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Mutations in a number of these conserved residues affected the kinetic and biochemical properties of the enzyme (Table I). Mutations in Asp-297, Cys-299, Tyr-300, Asp-359, and His-362 of the FTase ॆ-subunit decreased the catalytic efficiency 5–1000-fold. Protein substrate K m values for human FTase αॆR202A were much higher than for wild type enzyme, but this mutant showed no defect in FPP binding or utilization (Table I). FTase αॆR202A was 100–200-fold less sensitive than wild type enzyme to protein substrate competitive FTIs that contain a carboxylate while being similarly sensitive to protein substrate competitive FTIs lacking a free carboxylate (Table III). The structure of rat FTase shows that Arg-ॆ202 is near Tyr-ॆ361 and that both are in the vicinity of the Zn2+ ion (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Amino acid changes of Tyr-ॆ362 of yeast FTase, which is homologous to Tyr-ॆ361 of rat and human FTase, affects the X residue specificity of the CAAXsubstrate (37Del Villar K. Mitsuzawa H. Yang W. Sattler I. Tamanoi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 680-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The X residue of the protein substrate is the C-terminal amino acid containing a free carboxylate. Altogether, these data strongly suggest that Arg-ॆ202 interacts with the C-terminal carboxylate of the X residue of CAAXsubstrates. The interaction of the negatively charged carboxylate could be with the positively charged guanidino group of the arginine side chain. Given the difference in relative IC50 values for L-739,787 (C-terminal alcohol) and L-739,750 (C-terminal carboxylate) for wild type and αॆR202A, this is probably through an ionic interaction. Three mutant FTases, αॆR291A, αॆK294A, and αॆW303A, had elevated FPP and protein substrate K m values. The elevated FPP K d (app) for αॆR291A, αॆK294A, and αॆW303A indicate that these three mutant FTases have a primary FPP binding defect (Table I). The evidence for an FPP binding defect for αॆW303A was less convincing as theK d (app) value was only 5-fold higher than wild type. Since FPP binds before the protein substrate (10Pompliano D.L. Schaber M.D. Mosser S.D. Omer C.A. Shafer J.A. Gibbs J.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8341-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 11Furfine E.S. Leban J.J. Landavazo A. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6857-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), it may be that the elevated protein substrate K m values for these three mutant FTases are caused by the defect in FPP binding. In the crystal structure of rat FTase, Trp-ॆ303 is in a hydrophobic pocket that was proposed to be where the farnesyl chain binds (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Arg-ॆ291 and Lys-ॆ294 are near the surface of this pocket. In the rat FTase structure paper it was postulated that Arg-ॆ202 might be the amino acid that interacts with the negatively charged phosphates of FPP. We believe, however, that our data with these mutant FTases indicate that Arg-ॆ291 and Lys-ॆ294 are likely to be residues that interact with these phosphates and that Arg-ॆ202 interacts with the CAAX carboxylate. An additional mutant FTase that had a defect in FPP interaction (K d (app) and K m) was αॆH248A (Table I). His-ॆ248 is a residue near the Zn2+ ion and nearby Arg-ॆ291 and Lys-ॆ294 in rat FTase (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of rat FTase identified Asp-ॆ297, Cys-ॆ299, and His-ॆ362 as Zn2+ ligands (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). ॆC299A has also been shown to be a Zn2+ ligand by biochemical and molecular techniques (33Fu H.-W. Moomaw J.F. Moomaw C.R. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28541-28548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Changing any one of these three residues or Asp-ॆ359 to alanine inhibited binding of 65Zn2+ (Fig.2). All four mutant enzymes bound FPP withK d (app) values similar to wild type FTase (Table I). The ability of these mutants to bind FPP is consistent with previous results indicating that isoprenoid binding is Zn2+-independent (12Reiss Y. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6403-6408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The residual catalytic activity of αॆD297A, αॆD359A, and αॆH362A (αॆC299A was essentially inactive) was shown to be dependent on added Zn2+ (TableII). While in the rat FTase crystal structure Asp-ॆ359 is too far away from the Zn2+ ion to be a ligand, these data suggest that it may have an effect on Zn2+ binding. Whether the effect is direct or indirect is presently unclear. Besides mutations in residues that affected Zn2+ ion binding, the only other mutant FTase that decreasedk CAT was αॆY300F (Table I). Thek CAT of this enzyme was reduced about 5-fold relative to wild type enzyme. In the crystal structure of rat FTase, Tyr-ॆ300 appears to be close to the Zn2+ ion (26Park J.T. Boduluri S.R. Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. Beese L.T. Science. 1997; 275: 1800-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). While mutation of this tyrosine to phenylalanine may simply cause a localized effect on the position of the two substrates, it may also indicate a catalytic role for this residue. In glutathioneS-transferases the hydroxyl of a conserved tyrosine residue has been shown both structurally and biochemically to stabilize the catalytic thiolate anion (38Liu S. Zhang P. Ji X. Johnson W.W. Gilliland G.L. Armstrong R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4296-4299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Ji X. Zhang P. Armstrong R.N. Gilliland G.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10169-10184Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We are currently testing whether the proximity of Tyr-ॆ300 to the Zn2+ indicates a similar role for this tyrosine in FTase. The experiments presented here shed light on the roles of 11 conserved amino acids of the ॆ-subunit of FTase in substrate binding, catalysis, and zinc binding. Additional studies will be needed to further define enzyme-substrate interactions and substrate specificity. While it appears that the essential Zn2+ ion is involved in catalysis, it is not clear exactly how this occurs or what other contributions the enzyme might make to catalysis. Further structural, molecular, and biochemical studies should permit the answering of these questions. We thank Erwin Lin for help in purifying some of the mutant FTases used in this study, Jay Gibbs for comments on the manuscript, and Allen Oliff for his continuing support of our work."

The transcript has been cloned and sequenced, and is apparently normal (25Pantazis P. Sariban E. Bohan C.A. Antoniades H.N. Kalyanaraman V.S.

Science. 1984; 225: 636-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Expression of c-sis is normally tightly regulated in a cell type- and developmental stage-specific manner and is thought to play a role in wound healing and early development (28Dirks R.P.H. Jansen H.J. van Gerven B. Onnekink C. Bloemers H.P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 1119-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is not normally expressed, however, in lymphocytes. PDGF is a potent mitogen and chemoattractant for cells of mesenchymal origin (29Ross R. Vogel A. Cell. 1978; 14: 203-210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Biologically active PDGF is a dimeric protein consisting of homo- and heterodimeric combinations of two polypeptide chains, A and B (30Johnsson A. Heldin C.-H. Westermark B. Wasteson A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 104: 66-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The major function of PDGF is to induce mitosis in quiescent target cells. PDGF exerts its effects through binding to two types of receptors, the α receptor, which binds both A and B chains with high affinity, and the ॆ receptor, which binds only the B chain (31Hart C.E. Bowen-Pope D.F. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 94: 53S-57SAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PDGF was first implicated in the process of transformation when one of its polypeptide chains, the B-chain/c-sis, was found to be homologous to the viralsis oncogene (v-sis) (23Doolittle R.F. Hunkapiller M.W. Hood L.E. Devare S.G. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Antoniades H.N. Science. 1983; 221: 275-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 24Waterfield M.D. Scrace G.T. Whittle N.

Indeed, expression of a recombinant, wild-type human c-sis/PDGF-Bgene in mouse 3T3 cells, which express both the α and ॆ PDGF receptors, resulted in the transformation of these cells (32Clarke M.F. Westin E. Schmidt D. Josephs S.F. Ratner L. Wong-Staal F. Gallo R.C. Reitz Jr., M.R. Nature. 1984; 308: 464-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Because lymphocytes in general were thought to have no receptors for PDGF, it was previously postulated that the c-sis/PDGF-B expression in HTLV-1 infected T-cells could possibly provide a paracrine function, perhaps stimulating stromal cells, or other nonlymphocytic cells known to have PDGF receptors. More recently, however, it has been demonstrated that HTLV-1 infected T-cells also express high levels of PDGF-ॆ receptor transcripts and synthesize protein that can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the PDGF receptor that binds the PDGF-B homodimer and the PDGF-AB heterodimer (33Goustin A.S. Galanopoulos T. Kalyanaraman V.S. Pantazis P. Growth Factors. 1990; 2: 189-195PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest the possibility that HTLV-1 infected T-cells might acquire an auotcrine mechanism of cell proliferation that involves PDGF. With regard to the regulatory mechanism(s) that underlies c-sis/PDGF-B expression in HTLV-1-infected T-cells, previous work from our laboratory (34Trejo S.R. Fahl W.E. Ratner L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14584-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and others (35Liang Y. Robinson D.F. Dennig J. Suske G. Fahl W.E. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 7563-7567Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), identified a regulatory site at −64 to −45 within the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter, that we named Tax-responsive element 1 (TRE1). This regulatory site was shown to be essential for transactivation by Tax. In addition, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) analysis and antibody supershift analysis of TRE1-binding proteins in Jurkat-E6.1 and Jurkat-Tax cell nuclear extracts, along with nuclear extracts prepared from the HTLV-1 infected T-cell line, HUT102, identified the Sp family members, Sp1 and Sp3, along with a member of the immediate early response gene family, NGFI-A/Egr-1 (for the sake of simplicity, NGFI-A/Egr-1 from this point on will be referred to as Egr-1), as the main TRE1-binding factors mediating Tax-responsiveness. In the current study, we have investigated the mechanism(s) whereby Tax transactivates the c-sis/PDGF-B proto-oncogene promoter. In vitro transcription analysis showed that Tax was able to markedly increase RNA synthesis from a template containing the −257 to +74 region of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis of the TRE1 region was used to identify a CCACCC and GNGNGGGNG motif essential for transactivation by Tax. EMSA analysis hinted at a possible mechanism of Tax transactivation in that Tax was able to substantially increase the DNA binding activity of both Sp1 and Egr-1 to their DNA recognition sites contained within TRE1. In addition, EMSA analysis also indicated the possibility of ternary complex formation consisting of Sp1 or Egr-1, Tax, and DNA, suggesting that Tax might stably interact with both Sp1 and Egr-1 through protein-protein contacts. We show by co-immunoprecipitation analysis that Tax does indeed stably interact with both Sp1 and Egr-1 in both the absence of DNA and from intact cells. Finally, we identified two Tax mutants, C29S and L320G, that were unable to transactivate the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter by more than 2-fold. Interestingly, co-immunoprecipitation analysis also revealed that Tax mutant C29S was unable to interact with Egr-1, whereas, Tax mutant L320G was able to interact with Egr-1. The results presented in this article support the possibility of the existence of an additional, as yet uncharacterized, pathway of transactivation by Tax involving members of the zinc finger family of transcription factors. The T-cell lines, Jurkat E6.1 and Jurkat-Tax (J-tax-19; a generous gift from Warner C. Greene) (40Wano Y. Feinberg M. Hosking J.B. Bogerd H. Greene W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Stimulation of cells was performed by treatment for 6–8 h (unless otherwise specified) with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (0.4 ॖg/ml). The c-sis/PDGF-B luciferase reporter plasmid, pRALuc, the pRALuc linker-scanning mutants, −64/−55, −54/−45, and −34/−25 and the pRALuc site-directed mutant constructs, YL0-YL7, have been described previously (38Jin H.-M.

Biochemical Corp.). 5 × 106 Jurkat-Tax cells were transfected with 5 ॖg of either the pRALuc luciferase reporter plasmid, the pRALuc linker-scanning mutants, −64/−55 and −54/−45, or the pRALuc site-directed mutant constructs, YL0-YL7, using the Lipofectin reagent method protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). When stimulated, the cells were divided equally 36 h post-transfection into two flasks; one flask was supplemented with TPA (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (0.4 ॖg/ml), and the other flask received the same volume of solvent. Thirty-six hours after stimulation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and cell lysates were prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing in an ethanol/dry ice bath and 37 °C water bath. Cell extracts were normalized for protein content by a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of protein were used for the luciferase assays as described previously (34Trejo S.R. Fahl W.E. Ratner L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14584-14590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For the analysis of the Tax mutants, 5 × 106 Jurkat E6.1 cells were transfected with 3 ॖg of the pRALuc luciferase reporter plasmid alone or, plus, where indicated, 3 ॖg of the wild-type Tax expression plasmid, IEX, or the Tax mutant expression plasmids, IEXS10A, IEXC29S, IEXH43Q, IEXS258A, and L320G, using the Lipofectin reagent method protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four hours post-transfection, the cells were stimulated with TPA (10 ng/ml) and ionomycin (0.4 ॖg/ml). Twenty-four hours post-stimulation, cell lysates were prepared and luciferase assays were carried out as described above. Nuclear extracts were prepared from Jurkat E6.1 cells treated with 10 ng/ml TPA and 0.4 ॖg/ml ionomycin for 1–2 h as described by Leiden et al.(44Leiden J.M. Wang C.-Y. Petryniak B. Markovitz D.M.

Briefly, nuclei were isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g for 2 min following cell lysis with 40 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 57 glycerol, 8 ॖg of aprotinin/ml, 2 ॖg of leupeptin/ml, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 0.27 Nonidet P-40 (v/v). Nuclei were resuspended in a solution of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.42 m KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 257 (v/v) glycerol for 30 min at 4 °C. Extracts were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatants were dialyzed for 6–24 h at 4 °C against 1 ×in vitro transcription buffer (buffer A) containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1 m KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 207 (v/v) glycerol and frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). Purification of TaxH6 proceeded as follows: Escherichia coliBL21(DE3) cells transformed with pTaxH6 were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of Terrific Broth medium containing 100 ॖg/ml ampicillin until A 600 = 1.0–1.5, then induced for TaxH6 expression with 40 ॖmisopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature overnight. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 300 mm NaCl, 0.25 mmPMSF, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mmimidazole. The cells were ruptured by sonication carried out at a 607 duty cycle for 4 × 1 min duty cycle. After centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C for at least 2 h. The protein bound gel matrix was then packed into a column (1.5 cm × 10 cm) and washed with 40 ml of the same buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. TaxH6 protein was then eluted with a 50-ml gradient of 50–500 mm imidazole. A negative control bacterial extract (prepared in the same manner from bacteria that were transformed with a vector containing no insert DNA) was also prepared. Purification of NGFI-A/Egr-1H6 proceeded as follows: E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with pJDM1731 were grown at 37 °C in 1 liter of Terrific Broth medium containing 100 ॖg/ml ampicillin and 60 ॖg/liter chloramphenicol until A 600 = 0.7–1.0, then induced for NGFI-A/Egr-1H6 expression with 800 ॖmisopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-dgalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 5 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in 20 ml of ice-cold PBS containing 300 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm PMSF, 0.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mm imidazole. The cells were ruptured by sonication carried out at a 607 duty cycle for 4 × 1 min duty cycle. After centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of Ni2+-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) at 4 °C for at least 2 h. The protein bound gel matrix was then packed into a column (1.5 cm × 10 cm) and washed with 40 ml of the same buffer containing 40 mm imidazole. NGFI-A/Egr-1H6 protein was then eluted with a 50-ml gradient of 50–500 mm imidazole. Fractions collected from both the TaxH6 purification and the NGFI-A/Egr-1H6 purification were analyzed by SDS-7.57 polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Purity of each was determined to be approximately >957. Fractions containing purified TaxH6 and NGFI-A/Egr-1H6 were further analyzed by Western blotting using antisera against Tax (αTaxC; a generous gift from W. C. Greene), and NGFI-A/Egr-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The fractions containing either purified TaxH6 or NGFI-A/Egr-1H6 were dialyzed for 6–24 h at 4 °C against buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.1 mKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 207 (v/v) glycerol and frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with a commercially available kit (Bio-Rad). The following double-stranded oligonucleotide probes, corresponding to nucleotides −83 to −45 of the c-sis/PDGF-B promoter and containing the TRE1 region, or a mutated CCACCC motif of the TRE1 region, respectively, were prepared by annealing complementary, single-stranded oligonucleotides (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a thermocycler (95 °C for 5 min, cool to 25 °C at 1 °C/min): TRE1, 5′-GCCAGAAGAGGAAAGGCTGTCTCCACCCACCTCTCGCAC-3′; TRE1-mSp1, 5′-GCCAGAAGAGGAAAGGCTGTCTGATCGAACCTCTCGCAC-3′. Each probe was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN Biomedicals, Inc.) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Typicalin vitro binding reactions (20 ॖl) contained approximately 1 ng of either purified Sp1 (Promega) or purified NGFI-A/Egr-1H6, 1 ॖg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham), 1 × Superdex buffer (13Armstrong A.P.

In samples containing TaxH6, approximately 400 ng of purified TaxH6 was used in each reaction. EMSA analysis with dilutions of TaxH6 down to 25 ng was also performed, with similar results observed (data not shown). Once all of the appropriate factors had been added to each sample, the samples were allowed to incubate 5 min at room temperature in 1 × Superdex buffer prior to the addition of labeled probe. After the addition of labeled probe, the mixture was incubated a further 10 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were then resolved by electrophoresis on a 57 nondenaturing, polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide/N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide weight ratio, 49:1) at 165 V for 4 h at 4 °C in 1 × TGE buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 190 mm glycine, 1 mm EDTA). In reactions that included cold (unlabeled) oligonucleotide competitors, the samples were allowed to incubate with the cold oligonucleotide probes, along with poly(dI-dC) in 1 × Superdex buffer, for 10 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the labeled DNA probe. In reactions containing αTaxC Ab, 2 ॖl of αTaxC antiserum was added to the appropriate samples and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C, along with poly(dI-dC) in 1 × Superdex buffer, for 1 h at 4 °C prior to the addition of the labeled DNA probe. The gels were then dried under vacuum at 80 °C for 1 h and exposed to XAR-5 film. Co-immunoprecipitation reactions (50 ॖl), using purified proteins, contained approximately 200 ng of either purified Sp1 (Promega) or purified NGFI-A/Egr-1H6, and approximately 400 ng of purified TaxH6 in 1 × Superdex buffer. The samples, containing the various purified proteins, were allowed to incubate for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition of 5 ॖl of pooled Tax monoclonal antibodies (αTax mAbs) (45Langton B.C.

For co-immunoprecipitation reactions involving HTLV-1-infected cells, whole cell extracts were prepared from 100 × 106 MT2 cells. The cells were washed 1 time with 5 ml of PBS. The cells were then lysed with 2 ml of RIPA buffer (0.57 deoxycholic acid, 0.17 SDS, 17 Nonidet P-40) for 5 min at room temperature and clarified by spinning at 14,000 × gfor 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was divided equally into two samples; to one sample was added 7 ॖl of pooled αTax mAbs, the other sample did not receive any pooled αTax mAbs as a control. The samples from both the purified protein co-immunoprecipitation reactions, and the co-immunoprecipitation reactions involving whole cell extracts prepared from HTLV-1-infected cells, were then incubated for 1 h on a rotator at 4 °C. 50 ॖl of a 507 slurry solution of immobilized rProtein A-Sepharose (Repligen Corp.) was then added to each sample. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 18–24 h on a rotator at 4 °C. The beads were then gently washed 5–8 times with 500 ॖl of RIPA buffer. The bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample loading buffer, subjected to electrophoresis on a 7.57 denaturing polyacrylamide gel, transferred to nitrocellulose, and Western blotted for Tax (αTaxC), Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and NGFI-A/Egr-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) (Amersham). After each individual Western blot, the blot was stripped by submerging the membrane in stripping buffer (100 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 27 SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) and incubating at 50 °C for 30 min. The same blot (membrane), for each, separate, co-immunoprecipitation was used for all Western blots pertaining to that co-immunoprecipitation. Bands were quantitated with a Densitometer (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). 5 ॖg of either the wild type Tax expression plasmid, IEX, or the Tax mutant expression plasmids, IEXC29S and IEXL320G, were transfected into 40–607 confluent COS-7 cells in a 100-mm tissue culture dish, either alone or with 5 ॖg of the Egr-1 expression plasmid, pJDM948, using the Lipofectin reagent method protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5 ॖg of pJDM948 was also transfected alone into 40–607 confluent COS-7 cells in a 100-mm tissue culture dish as a control for Egr-1 expression. Each of the transfections was performed in triplicate. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were washed with PBS, harvested by trypsinization, and pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cells from all samples, except the Egr-1 alone sample, were then lysed by resuspending the cell pellet in 0.5 ml of RIPA buffer for 5 min at room temperature and clarified by spinning at 14,000 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C. For the Egr-1 alone sample, a whole cell extract was prepared by three cycles of freeze-thawing in an ethanol/dry ice bath and 37 °C water bath. 5 ॖl of pooled αTax mAbs was added to each sample, except the Egr-1 alone sample, and the samples w"

For example, two members of this family, GRK4 and GRK6, contain C-terminal cysteine residues that are palmitoylated. To address whether the activity and membrane association of GRK6 is regulated by palmitoylation, we overexpressed and characterized wild-type GRK6 and two GRK6 mutants, one with the palmitoylation sites mutated to serines (GRK6-pal−) and one containing a C-terminal CAAX motif to promote geranylgeranylation (GRK6-GG). Compared with wild-type GRK6, GRK6-pal− had a ∼5-fold higher K m and ∼2-fold lower V max for phosphorylating rhodopsin, whereas GRK6-GG exhibited a ∼2-fold lowerK m and ∼14-fold higherV max for rhodopsin. In contrast, wild-type GRK6 and GRK6-pal− displayed similar activity toward the nonreceptor substrate phosvitin, indicating that nonpalmitoylated GRK6 is catalytically active. Wild-type GRK6 and GRK6-GG, but not GRK6-pal−, also bound significantly to phosphatidylcholine vesicles (36 ± 3, 79 ± 4, and 4 ± 27, respectively) suggesting that GRK6 activity is dependent upon its ability to interact with the plasma membrane. When assayed in COS-1 cells GRK6-pal− promoted minimal agonist-dependent sequestration of the ॆ2-adrenergic receptor, while sequestration was significantly increased in cells expressing either wild-type GRK6 or GRK6-GG. These data demonstrate an important functional link between the ability of GRK6 to bind to the plasma membrane, a process that appears to be regulated by palmitoylation, and its activity toward receptor substrates.

G protein-coupled receptors mediate numerous intracellular signaling pathways upon binding extracellular agonists (e.g.hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants, chemoattractants, and light) (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar,2O'Dowd B.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1989; 2: 67-83Crossref Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Receptors of this type regulate a variety of effector molecules such as adenylyl cyclase, cGMP phosphodiesterase, phospholipases A2 and C, and numerous ion channels. Two of the best studied G protein-coupled receptors are the ॆ2-adrenergic receptor (ॆ2AR), 1The abbreviations used are: ॆ2AR, ॆ2-adrenergic receptor; ॆARK, ॆ-adrenergic receptor kinase; G protein, guanine nucleotide-binding protein; GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; PH, pleckstrin homology; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PC, phosphatidylcholine; PIP2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-diphosphate. which mediates catecholamine stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, and the visual light receptor, rhodopsin, which facilitates phototransduction in retinal rod cells (3Gomez J.

Mueckler M. Molecular Biology of Receptors and Transporters: Receptors. Academic Press, New York1992: 49-98Google Scholar). In both systems a rapid diminution of responsiveness or desensitization occurs following receptor activation (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

Activation-dependent desensitization is mediated in part by specific G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) that have the unique ability to recognize and phosphorylate their receptor substrates only when they are in an active conformation (6Palczewski K.

The ॆ-adrenergic receptor kinase (ॆARK) and rhodopsin kinase have been implicated as the major kinases involved in the stimulus-dependent phosphorylation of the ॆ2AR and rhodopsin, respectively (8Benovic J.L.

Subsequent uncoupling of the receptor from the G protein is promoted by arrestin proteins that specifically bind to the phosphorylated and activated form of the receptor (3Gomez J. Benovic J.L.

Rhodopsin kinase, ॆARK, and ॆARK2 undergo stimulus-dependent translocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, although this is achieved through two somewhat different mechanisms (13Pitcher J.A. Inglese J. Higgins J.B. Arriza J.L. Casey P.J. Kim C. Benovic J.L. Kwatra M.M. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1264-1267Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 20Inglese J. Koch W.J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin kinase contains a 舠CAAX舡 motif at its C terminus that directs the attachment of a C15 isoprenoid (farnesyl) moiety required for membrane binding and optimal kinase activity (12Inglese J. Glickman J.F. Lorenz W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1422-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Agonist-dependent translocation of ॆARK and ॆARK2 does not involve direct acylation of these kinases but, instead, appears to be facilitated by their binding to G protein ॆγ subunits that are themselves membrane-bound via isoprenylation (13Pitcher J.A.

Furthermore, binding of ॆARK and ॆARK2 to phospholipids and Gॆγ augments kinase activity toward receptor substrates indicating an important regulatory function of this complex in GRK-mediated receptor phosphorylation (14DebBurman S.K.

GRK5, which is not acylated, possesses a highly basic C-terminal domain that enables the kinase to bind to the plasma membrane (17Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Premont R. Koch W.J. Inglese J. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6832-6841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction of GRK5 with membrane phospholipids enhances kinase autophosphorylation, which increases its activity toward receptor substrates (17Kunapuli P. Gurevich V.V. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10209-10212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies performed in our laboratory with GRK6 overexpressed in and purified from Sf9 insect cells revealed that GRK6 has significantly lower activity than ॆARK and GRK5 toward rhodopsin, the ॆ2AR, and the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptorin vitro (24Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22691-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We postulated that the observed differences in GRK6, ॆARK, and GRK5 activity may be due either to distinct substrate specificities among these GRKs and/or a lack of a functionally relevant cofactor for GRK6. Recently, it was demonstrated that GRK4 and GRK6 are palmitoylated enabling these enzymes to associate with the plasma membrane (18Stoffel R.H. Randall R.R. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27791-27794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Premont R.T. Macrae A.D. Stoffel R.H. Chung N. Pitcher J.A. Ambrose C. Inglese J. MacDonald M.E. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6403-6410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, the role that palmitoylation plays in the function of these kinases remains obscure. In an effort to better understand the role that palmitoylation might play in regulating GRK6 localization and activity, we generated a mutant kinase lacking the putative palmitoylation sites and assessed its function both in vitro and in intact cells. We show that nonpalmitoylated GRK6 exhibits significantly diminished activityin vitro toward rhodopsin compared with wild-type GRK6 and that this reduced activity is likely due to its inability to interact with phospholipid. In contrast, when the palmitoylation-deficient GRK6 is modified with a C-terminal isoprenoid moiety both the activity and phospholipid binding are enhanced compared with wild-type GRK6. Furthermore, we demonstrate that COS-1 cells transiently coexpressing the ॆ2AR and nonpalmitoylated GRK6 undergo significantly less agonist-dependent receptor sequestration compared with cells expressing either wild-type or isoprenylated GRK6. The chromatography resin SP(HP)-Sepharose was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Frozen bovine retinas were from George A. Hormel & Co. COS-1 monkey kidney cells were from the American Type Culture Collection. Phosvitin was from Sigma, whereas [γ-32P]ATP was from NEN Life Science Products. Affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for GRK6 and control peptide containing amino acids 525–544 of GRK6 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Mutant GRK6 sequences were PCR-amplified from the GRK6 cDNA (25Benovic J.L. Gomez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19521-19527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in pBluescript using a forward primer corresponding to bases 1192–1209 (5′-AGATGATCGCAGGCCAGT-3′) and one of two mutant reverse primers corresponding to the 3′ end of the GRK6 sequence: 5′-CAATGGATCCCTAGAGGCGGGTGGGCAGCTCTTCCTCGCTGTCGCTGCTGTTTCCGCTGCTATCTTGGCGACTGA-3′ (GRK6-pal−, palmitoylation-deficient mutant with Cys561, Cys562, and Cys565 mutated to serine); or 5′CAATGGATCCCTACAGCAGCACGCAGAGGCGGGTGGGCAGCTCTTCCTCGCTGTCGCTGCTGTTTCCGCTGCTATCTTGGCGACTGA-3′(GRK-6GG, palmitoylation deficient mutant with Cys-Val-Leu-Leu added to the C terminus). The reverse primers also mutagenize the SacI restriction site found at base pair 1777 of the open reading frame to facilitate subcloning into the mammalian expression vector pBC12BI (see below). All PCR reactions were performed using the Expand PCR system (Boehringer Mannheim). PCR products were digested with SphI and BamHI, which yielded ∼360-base pair fragments and then subcloned into pBluescript-GRK6 digested with the same enzymes. The PCR derived portion was sequenced using an automated DNA sequencer. DNA was cut with SacI and BamHI restriction enzymes, and the ∼1600-base pair fragments subcloned into pBC-GRK6 digested with the same enzymes (26Loudon R.P. Perussia B. Benovic J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 4547-4557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides and DNA sequencing were provided by the Kimmel Cancer Institute DNA Facility. To overexpress wild-type and mutant GRK6, 12 ॖg each of pBC-GRK6, pBC-GRK6-pal−, and pBC-GRK6-GG were used to transiently transfect COS-1 cells in T75 tissue culture flasks by the lipofectAMINE method following the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were trypsinized 48 h after transfection, washed several times with ice-cold PBS, and then lysed in 300 ॖl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 17 Triton X-100, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 ॖg/ml leupeptin, and 200 ॖg/ml benzamidine. Lysates were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and supernatants recovered. Supernatants were diluted to 1.2 ml in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 ॖg/ml benzamidine, and 20 ॖg/ml leupeptin (buffer A), and GRK6 purification was performed by batchwise SP-Sepharose chromatography using 150 ॖl of resin. After 1 h of incubation of the resin with the cell lysates at 4 °C on a rotator, the resin was washed six times with 1 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl to remove trace amounts of ॆARK present in the adsorbed lysate. A GRK6-enriched fraction was obtained by eluting the resin three times with 200 ॖl of buffer A containing 400 mm NaCl and pooling the eluants. Quantitation of GRK6 expression in COS-1 cells and recovery after SP-Sepharose chromatography was done by immunoblotting with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum raised against a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein corresponding to the C-terminal 102 amino acids of GRK5 (immunoreactive with both GRK5 and GRK6). Equivalent amounts of lysates and partially purified GRK6 preparations (between 5 and 40 ॖg of total protein measured by Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin) were electrophoresed on a 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gel (27Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), transferred to nitrocellulose, washed in 0.057 Tween, Tris-buffered saline (TTBS), pH 7.5, and blocked for 1 h in TTBS with 57 (w/v) dried nonfat milk. Filters were immunoblotted for 1 h with the polyclonal antiserum (1:100 dilution) in 57 milk, TTBS and then washed five times, 10 min each, with TTBS and incubated with affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) in 57 milk, TTBS (1:4000 dilution). Filters were washed five times in TTBS and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Wild-type and mutant GRK6 were quantitated by comparing different amounts of the eluted preparations with known amounts of purified GRK6 (1–4 ng) (24Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22691-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Typical yields from one flask of confluent COS-1 cells were 400–500 ng for wild-type GRK6, 1200–1500 ng for GRK6-pal−, and 150–200 ng for GRK6-GG. Urea-treated rod outer segments containing rhodopsin were prepared from bovine retinas, and rhodopsin phosphorylation was performed as described previously (11Shichi H. Somers R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7040-7046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22691-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For time course assays, 1.3 ng of each kinase preparation (determined by quantitative immunoblotting) was incubated with 200 ॖm[γ-32P]ATP (1 cpm/fmol), 4.6 mmMgCl2, 6.8 ॖm rhodopsin, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, and 2 mm EDTA in a total volume of 30 ॖl for 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated at the indicated times with 15 ॖl SDS sample buffer, and 30 ॖl of each sample were electrophoresed on a 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed for 2–3 h at −80 °C. Quantitation was performed by excising the phosphorylated rhodopsin bands and counting in a scintillation counter. Determination ofK m and V max values was performed by assaying 0.1–20 ॖm rhodopsin with 1.3 ng of the different GRK6 proteins in 30 ॖl of buffer (200 ॖm[γ-32P]ATP (1 cpm/fmol), 4.6 mmMgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, and 2 mm EDTA) for 5 min at 37 °C. Reactions were terminated with 15 ॖl of SDS sample buffer and processed as described above. In all experiments, wild-type and mutant GRK6 preparations were stored at 4 °C and were used within 3–4 days after purification. No reduction in kinase activity was observed during this time. When tested, SP-Sepharose eluants from pBC12BI-transfected control cells exhibited no detectable levels of rhodopsin phosphorylation over time (data not shown). 5–10 × 106 COS-1 cells transfected with pBC12BI, pBC-GRK6, or pBC-GRK6-pal− were trypsinized and lysed in 100 ॖl of 17 Triton X-100 lysis buffer as described above. 3 ॖg of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was coupled to 10 ॖl of protein A-agarose beads (Boehringer Mannheim), washed three times with buffer B (0.27 Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 200 ॖg/ml benzamidine, 20 ॖg/ml leupeptin), and then incubated with 90 ॖl of cell lysate for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotator. The remaining 10 ॖl of lysate was used for Western blot analysis to quantitate the levels of GRK6 expression. The beads were washed three times with buffer B followed by a single wash with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA to remove Triton X-100 and NaCl (both of which inhibit GRK activity), resuspended in 30 ॖl assay buffer (200 ॖm [γ-32P]ATP (1 cpm/fmol), 4.6 mm MgCl2, 133 ॖg/ml phosvitin (Sigma), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA), and incubated for 15 or 20 min at 30 °C. Reactions were terminated with 20 ॖl of SDS sample buffer, and the samples were centrifuged briefly and then electrophoresed on a 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried, and autoradiography was performed. Quantitation of the phosphorylated phosvitin bands was performed as described above for the rhodopsin phosphorylation assays. Recovery of kinase immunoprecipitated from cell lysates containing either wild-type or mutant GRK6 was ∼807 (data not shown). Immunoprecipitatable activity from lysates of cells transfected with the pBC vector alone revealed no significant level of phosvitin phosphorylation compared with either wild-type- or GRK6-pal−-expressing cells (data not shown). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of GRK6 in the presence of a GRK6 peptide corresponding to the kinase C terminus reduced phosvitin phosphorylation to control levels (data not shown). Crude soybean phosphatidylcholine (PC) was sonicated on ice at a concentration of 17 mg/ml in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. The sonicated PC vesicles were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C, and a new aliquot was used for each experiment. Binding assays were performed using ∼15 ng of partially purified wild-type GRK6, GRK6-pal−, and GRK6-GG that was diluted in 48 ॖl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl and pre-spun at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove any aggregated GRK6. The supernatants (54 ॖl) were then added to either 6 ॖl of PC vesicles (to give a final phospholipid concentration of 1.7 mg/ml) or 6 ॖl of PC buffer alone and incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 10 min and the supernatants (60 ॖl) and pellets (resuspended in 60 ॖl of buffer) were dissolved in SDS sample buffer. 30 ॖl of each sample was electrophoresed on a 107 SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis as described above. Quantitation of the percent GRK6 bound to PC vesicles was done using a Molecular Dynamics personal densitometer and ImageQuant software. COS-1 cells grown to ∼907 confluence in T75 flasks were cotransfected for 48 h as described above with 8 ॖg of pBC-ॆ2AR and 8 ॖg of pBC12BI, pBC-GRK6, pBC-GRK6-pal−, or pBC-GRK6-GG. Transfected cells were trypsinized, washed several times with PBS, and resuspended in 1.1 ml of PBS, 0.1 mm ascorbate. 0.5-ml aliquots of each cell suspension were incubated with or without 10 ॖm(−)-isoproterenol for 0–45 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped with ice-cold PBS; the cells were centrifuged at 2,000 ×g for 5 min, washed twice with PBS, and then resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS. Cell surface ॆ2AR levels were determined by incubating the cells with 10 nm(−)-[3H]-CGP12177 for 3 h at 14 °C followed by vacuum filtration as described (28Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 20 ॖm alprenolol. To assess the role of palmitoylation in GRK6 function we used two expression constructs containing either the wild-type GRK6 cDNA (26Loudon R.P. Perussia B. Benovic J.L. Blood. 1996; 88: 4547-4557Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or a mutant GRK6 in which the three putative palmitoylated cysteines (Cys561, Cys562, and Cys565) (18Stoffel R.H. Randall R.R. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27791-27794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were changed to serines (GRK6-pal−) (Fig.1 A). Direct experimental evidence that one or more of these residues is palmitoylated comes from [3H]palmitate labeling of COS cells expressing either wild-type or pal− GRK6 in which wild-type GRK6, but not the pal− kinase, incorporated radiolabeled palmitate (18Stoffel R.H. Randall R.R. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27791-27794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transiently expressing wild-type GRK6 or GRK6-pal− were lysed and the kinases were partially purified by SP-Sepharose chromatography. Partial purification of the expressed proteins was necessary since their activity in crude lysates was largely inhibited due to the detergent in the lysis buffer and inhibitors present in the cell lysates (data not shown). Expression of wild-type GRK6 (∼67 kDa) was ∼8-fold higher compared with endogenous levels observed in pBC control-transfected cells, whereas the GRK6-pal− mutant was expressed ∼3-fold higher than wild-type GRK6 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1, 2, and 4). One relatively simple way to assess GRK activity toward G protein-coupled receptors involves the use of bovine rod outer segments that contain high levels of the photoreceptor rhodopsin. Using equivalent amounts of the two GRK6 proteins, time-course studies revealed a ∼5-fold reduced ability of GRK6-pal− to phosphorylate light-activated rhodopsin compared with wild-type GRK6 (Fig. 2 A). GRK6-pal− exhibited a significantly lower affinity for rhodopsin as evidenced by a ∼5-fold higher K m (12.0 ± 0.5 ॖm) compared with wild-type GRK6 (2.6 ± 0.4 ॖm) (TableI). However, mutation of the GRK6 palmitoylation site modestly reduced (∼2-fold; Table I) its apparentV max with respect to wild-type GRK6 suggesting that lack of palmitoylation does not impair kinase catalytic activity. The K m of GRK6-pal− is strikingly similar to the K m for rhodopsin previously reported for Sf9 cell expressed and purified GRK6 (24Loudon R.P. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22691-22697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that the purified GRK6 is not palmitoylated, which may contribute to its apparent low activity.Table IKinetic parameters for wild-type and mutant GRK6KinaseK mV maxॖmnmol P i /min/mgGRK62.6 ± 0.4231 ± 20GRK6-pal−12.0 ± 0.5110 ± 2GRK6-gg1.2 ± 0.13244 ± 209Kinetic parameters of the different GRK6 proteins for phosphorylating rhodopsin were determined by incubating 0.1–20 ॖmrhodopsin and 1.3 ng of GRK6 for 5 min at 30 °C as described under 舠Experimental Procedures.舡 All values are presented as the mean ± S.E. from three to four independent experiments.

Since membrane targeting appears important for rhodopsin kinase, ॆARK, and GRK5 activity (12Inglese J. Glickman J.F. Lorenz W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

To do this we made a mutant that was still defective in palmitoylation but was also modified to include a C-terminal CAAX motif to promote protein geranylgeranylation (Fig.1 A) (29Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1743) Google Scholar). In this way, we wanted to determine whether the reduced ability of GRK6-pal− to phosphorylate receptors could be overcome by enhancing its association with phospholipids by isoprenylation. Expression of this protein (GRK6-GG) was approximately 30–407 of that observed for wild-type GRK6 (Fig. 1 B,lanes 2 and 6). When expressed in COS-1 cells and p"

These proteins facilitate the assembly of higher order nucleoprotein complexes. In proliferating cells, >307 of ChironomusHMGI was found to be phosphorylated. The phosphorylation sites were mapped to Ser3, Ser22, and Ser72and were found to be substrates for the kinases Cdc2 (and mitogen-activated protein (MAP)), MAP, and Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase, respectively. In mitotically arrested cells, the extent of phosphorylation at Ser3 increased, whereas phosphorylation at Ser22 remained unchanged. In nondividing cells, phosphorylation at Ser3 and Ser22 was strongly reduced. The DNA binding affinity of Chironomus HMGI was not influenced by single phosphorylation at Ser3 or Ser22. In contrast, phosphorylation at both of these sites resulted in a 10-fold weakening of the binding activity and altered the mode of protein-DNA interaction. Since both human and murine HMGI/Y proteins, similarly to the insect HMGI protein, possess phosphorylation sites for Cdc2 and MAP kinases that intersperse the AT-hookDNA-binding motifs, our results may reflect a general mechanism that regulates the properties and function of this class of putative transcriptional regulators.

Protein phosphorylation plays an essential role in the regulation of numerous processes in eukaryotic cells. In particular, this post-translational modification is involved in the modulation of the activity of transcription factors (reviewed in Ref. 1Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) and has a pivotal position in signal transduction processes (reviewed in Ref. 2Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar). The chromosomal non-histone high mobility group (HMG) 1The abbreviations used are: HMG, high mobility group; HMGI, high mobility group protein I; HMGY, high mobility group protein Y; HMGI/Y, high mobility group proteins I/Y; cHMGI,Chironomus high mobility group protein I; PKC, Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; Fmoc, N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl. proteins belong to the group of extensively phosphorylated proteins. Currently, the HMG proteins are grouped into three structurally distinct families: the HMG1/2 (HMG1 box domain proteins) family, the HMG14/17 family, and the HMGI/Y family. The cellular functions of these proteins are still not fully understood, although most data suggest that the HMG proteins facilitate chromatin functions by modulating the binding of transcription factors to target DNA, facilitate transcription, and stimulate the formation of enhancer complexes (reviewed in Ref. 3Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of HMG proteins depends on the physiological state of the cell. The HMG1/2 proteins are targets of Ca2+/phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC) (4Ramachandran C. Yau P. Bradbury E.M. Shyamala G. Yasuda H. Walsh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13495-13503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. Sapetto B. Eur. J.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3720-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of a testis-specific HMG protein is required for DNA packaging in elongating and condensing spermatids (6Alami-Ouahabi N. Veilleux S. Meistrich M.L. Boissonneault G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3720-3729Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In insect cells, the phosphorylation of Chironomus HMG1a and HMG1b proteins (homologous to HMG1) inhibits their binding to DNA and reduces the rate of nuclear translocation (5Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. Sapetto B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In rapidly growing mammalian cells, the HMGI/Y proteins, along with histone H1, are among the most extensively phosphorylated chromosomal proteins (7Lund T. Holtlund J. Laland S.G. FEBS Lett. 1985; 180: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Elton T.S. Reeves R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 157: 53-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A 2–3-fold increase in the degree of their phosphorylation was observed in mitotically arrested murine NIH 3T3 cells (9Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This increase in the extent of the HMGI protein phosphorylation was due solely to the modification of Thr53by Cdc2 kinase. The human HMGI protein has two potential Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation sites at Thr53 and Thr78 that are efficiently phosphorylated by this kinase in vitro (10Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This modification reduced the strength of HMGI binding to AT-rich DNA by up to a factor of 20 as observed in a Hoechst 33258 competition assay (10Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently identified and characterized an HMGI-homologous protein from insect cells (11Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The properties of the insect cHMGI protein resemble the major structural and functional features of the human HMGI/Y proteins. It contains three DNA-binding motifs (AT-hooks) (12Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and a negatively charged C-terminal domain and binds preferentially to AT-rich and four-way junction DNA (11Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By indirect immunofluorescence, we found that within the polytene chromosomes of Chironomus, the cHMGI protein is present in transcriptionally active chromatin and nucleoli, which suggests an involvement of this protein in type I and II transcriptional processes (13Ghidelli S. Claus P. Thies G. Wiśniewski J.R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 105: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the course of characterization of the dipteran homologue of the mammalian HMGI/Y proteins, we have analyzed cHMGI phosphorylation and its structural and functional consequences. Here we show that the insect HMGI protein possesses three sites of phosphorylation that arein vivo and in vitro substrates for Cdc2 (and MAP), MAP, and PKC kinases, respectively. Two phosphorylation sites are found to be located at both flanks of the N-terminally located AT-hook DNA-binding motif. We demonstrate that a simultaneous phosphorylation at both of these sites is necessary for a change in the DNA binding properties of the cHMGI protein. The multiple phosphorylation of the insect HMGI protein may reflect a mechanism for establishing different higher order complexes in chromatin involving both proteins and nucleic acids. As the AT-hook motifs in mammalian and insect HMGI proteins have similar positions with respect to their phosphorylation sites, our finding may not be restricted toChironomus protein and extends our knowledge of the mechanisms and consequences of phosphorylation of abundant transcriptional regulators containing AT-hook motifs. For these experiments, a continuous cell line from Chironomus tentans, established by Wyss (14Wyss C. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 139: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), was used. Cells were grown at 22.5 °C in suspension culture in ZO medium (14Wyss C. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 139: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) containing 17 fetal calf serum. Cells from 5- or 11-day-old cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 750 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, frozen, and stored at −20 °C. In some experiments, the cells were incubated in the presence of 200 nm20-hydroxyecdysone, or 50 ॖm PD 98059 (2′-amino-3′methoxyflavone), or 13 ॖm nocodazole for 24 h. HeLa cells were a gift from Dr. K. Zechel (Max-Planck-Institut für Biophysikalische Chemie, Göttingen, Germany). The proteins were extracted with 57 HClO4 in the presence of 50 mm NaF in three freeze/thaw cycles. The extracts were acidified with HCl to 0.35m and precipitated subsequently with 6 volumes of acetone at −20 °C for 12–18 h, and the pellets were washed twice with acetone. Alternatively, extracts were precipitated with 337 CCl3COOH on ice for 1 h. Pellets were washed with 337 CCl3COOH and 0.27 HCl in acetone and two times with pure acetone. The pellets were dried under vacuum and stored at −20 °C. Forty ml of an 8-day-old cell culture were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, resuspended in 1 ml of medium containing 2 mCi of [32P]orthophosphoric acid (carrier-free), and incubated for 5.5 h at room temperature. The HMG proteins were extracted and precipitated with CCl3COOH as described above. The cHMGI protein was expressed inEscherichia coli (15Heyduk T. Heyduk E. Claus P. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19763-19770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and purified as described previously (16Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Wiśniewski J.R. Heßler K. Claus P. Zechel K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The dried cHMGI protein was quantified gravimetrically. The concentration of the native forms of cHMGI was determined according to Ball (18Ball E.H. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 23-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using cHMGI as a standard. Fifty ॖg of the bacterially expressed or in vivo phosphorylated form of the cHMGI protein were phosphorylated at 30 °C by 10 units of recombinant human Cdc2 kinase or 25 units of activated rat MAP kinase (New England Biolabs Inc.) in the presence of 100 ॖm ATP and 2–10 ॖCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 ॖl of Cdc2 kinase buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.5) or MAP kinase buffer (50 mmTris/HCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.017 Brij 35, pH 7.5), respectively. The reactions were stopped by addition of CCl3COOH to a final concentration of 307 (w/v). The rates of phosphorylation of the cHMGI protein and peptides were measured in the presence of 5 nmol of protein or peptide and 1 unit of Cdc2 kinase in 30 ॖl of Cdc2 kinase buffer containing 400 ॖm ATP and 10 ॖCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reactions were stopped by addition of the concentrated loading buffer and electrophoresed on a 207 SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried, and the radioactive bands were cut out, solubilized at 95 °C in 200 ॖl of 307 H2O2, and counted. The phosphorylation of the protein using PKC was carried out as described previously (5Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. Sapetto B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 687-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Eight ॖg of human HMGI were phosphorylated either by 5 units of Cdc2 kinase or by 25 units of MAP kinase in the presence of 10 mm ATP and 20 ॖCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 4 ॖl at 30 °C for 2.5 h. The HMG proteins that were isolated from insect and HeLa cells and peptides of these proteins were purified on a reverse-phase HPLC column (300SB-C18, Zorbax) using a CH3CN gradient in 0.17 CF3COOH/H2O at a flow rate of 1 ml/min as described previously (19Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17170-17177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluted proteins were vacuum-concentrated and lyophilized. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on 160 × 160 × 1.0-mm slab gels. Proteins and peptides were separated on gels containing 15 or 207 polyacrylamide, 57 CH3COOH, 4 m urea, and 0.3757 Triton X-100 (AUT) (20Zweidler A. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. Gels with radioactive probes were dried and autoradiographed. Proteins from AUT gels were transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by electroblotting at 100 V for 12 min in 0.77 acetic acid and 107 methanol. The membrane was incubated with serum against a 14-mer peptide representing the sequence Ala71–Lys84 of cHMGI (13Ghidelli S. Claus P. Thies G. Wiśniewski J.R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 105: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a dilution of 1:5000. The bound antibodies were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-linked goat anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). The cleavage of cHMGI with proteinase Glu-C (V8) was performed in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 7.8 (digestion at Glu), or in 25 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.8 (digestion at Glu and Asp), at 22 °C for 18 h. Cleavage with trypsin was carried out in 20 mm NaCl and 20 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.5, at 22 °C for 2 h. The protein/proteinase ratio was 10:1 (w/w) in both cases. For analyzing the resulting peptides, they were hydrolyzed in constant boiling HCl for 24 h at 110 °C in vacuum. The hydrolysates were derivatized with phenyl isothiocyanate (21Bidlingmeyer B. Cohen S.A. Tarvin T.L. J. Chromatogr. 1984; 336: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (2128) Google Scholar) and analyzed on a Pico-Tag HPLC column (3.9 mm (internal diameter) × 150 mm; Waters). The phosphoamino acids were identified using a modified method of Ringer (22Ringer D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Proteins and peptides were hydrolyzed partially in constant boiling HCl for 2 h at 110 °C in vacuum. Lyophilized hydrolysates were derivatized with 0.1947 (w/v) Fmoc in 0.1 m borate buffer, pH 6.2, containing 507 (v/v) acetone for 2 min. The excess of Fmoc was removed by 3-fold extraction with hexane. Phosphoamino acid derivatives were separated on a weak anion-exchange column (BioSeries WAX, Zorbax) with a NaCl gradient in 557 CH3OH, 17 tetrahydrofuran, and 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 3.4, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Elution of Fmoc-derivatives was monitored by a fluorescence detector (SFM 25, Kontron Instruments), with the excitation and emission wavelengths set at 265 and 310 nm, respectively. Serine and threonine phosphate were used as a standard. The32P-labeled Cla11 monomer of AT-rich DNA was prepared as described previously (16Wiśniewski J.R. Schulze E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10713-10719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified proteins and the labeled DNA were incubated for 15 min at 20 °C in binding buffer (80 mm NaCl (low salt buffer) or 180 mm NaCl (physiological salt buffer), 1 mmMgCl2, 0.017 bovine serum albumin, 87 glycerol, and 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.9). The protein-DNA complexes were run on low ionic strength 67 polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were dried and autoradiographed. Peptides and phosphopeptides were synthesized by the solid-phase method on a Millipore Model 9050 peptide synthesizer using polyethylene glycol polystyrene support (PerSeptive). For the activation of Fmoc-derivatives,o-(azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate andN,N′-diisopropylethylamine were used. The peptides were deprotected and cleaved from resin by CF3COOH/anisole/methanesulfonic acid/dithiothreitol (94:2:2:2, v/v/v/w). All peptides were synthesized with an additional Cys residue at their C termini. The peptides were purified by reverse-phase C18 chromatography. The identity of the peptides was determined by amino acid analysis. The phosphate content was determined according to Fiske and SubbaRow (23Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar) using KH2PO4 as a standard. Six-day-old cell cultures were labeled withl-[4,5-3H]lysine (specific activity = 108 Ci/mmol) for 20 h. The final concentration of the labeled lysine was 2.5 ॖCi/ml of culture. The labeled cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh ZO medium (14Wyss C. Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 139: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) without tritiated lysine. After 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, respectively, the HClO4-soluble proteins were extracted from the cells as described above. The extracted proteins were electrophoretically separated by AUT-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After staining with Coomassie Blue R-250, the protein bands were cut out and solubilized in 200 ॖl of 307 H2O2 at 95 °C for 18 h; and after mixing with scintillation mixture, the radioactivity of the proteins was quantified in a 1600TR spectrometer (Canberra-Packard). Electrophoretic separation of crude HClO4 extracts of cultured cells followed by Western blotting revealed the presence of multiple forms ofChironomus HMGI protein (Fig.1 A, lanes 1 and2). 32P labeling of the cells in vivoshowed that protein bands of cHMGI with lower electrophoretic mobility were phosphorylated (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). The occurrence of these phosphoforms was substantially reduced in cells that finished proliferating and differentiated after treatment with the molting hormone ecdysone (Fig. 1 B). In these cells, a 2–3-fold decrease in the 32P incorporation in cHMGI was observed (data not shown). In contrast, a significant increase in the amount of the phosphorylated forms of the protein was observed in mitotically blocked cells (Fig. 1 B, nocodazole lane). Electrophoretic analysis of the cHMGI protein fractions obtained by reverse-phase chromatography revealed at least four cHMGI species. In addition to the unphosphorylated form, two peaks of a singly phosphorylated protein and one peak of a doubly phosphorylated form were observed (Fig.2 A). Phosphoamino acid analysis of the cHMGI protein fractions demonstrated the presence of phosphoserine residues in the cHMGI protein, whereas phosphothreonine was not detected (Fig. 2 B; note that cHMGI does not contain tyrosine). To localize the serine residues that were phosphorylatedin vivo, the 32P-labeled cHMGI protein was digested with proteinase Glu-C or trypsin. The degradation products were separated by HPLC and analyzed for radioactivity, and the amino acid composition of the isolated peptides was determined (Fig.3, A and B). The digestion with proteinase Glu-C revealed that the major phosphorylation sites are present in peptides comprising residues 1–19 and 20–29, respectively (Fig. 3 A). The radioactive products of the degradation of cHMGI with trypsin represented peptides 1–6 and 15–24 (Fig. 3 B). Analysis of the primary structure of the peptides indicated the presence of three serine residues: Ser1 and Ser3 in peptides 1–19 and 1–6 and Ser22 in peptides 20–29 and 15–24, respectively (Fig. 3 C). To distinguish between modifications at Ser1 and Ser3, the purified peptide 1–19 was digested with proteinase Glu-C under conditions that allowed cutting at the C terminus of Asp2. Phosphoamino acid analysis revealed that peptide 3–19, but not peptide 1–2, contained phosphoserine (data not shown). Thus, the phosphorylation sites were mapped to Ser3and Ser22. In addition, a minor phosphorylation site that represents <107 of the total phospho-cHMGI protein maps to Ser72 in peptides 48–93 and 69–74, obtained by cleavage with proteinase Glu-C and trypsin, respectively (Fig. 3, Aand B).Figure 3In vivo phosphorylation of the cHMGI protein can be mapped to Ser3, Ser22, and Ser72. The pooled fractions (fractions 1–20 shown in Fig. 2 A) of the in vivo 32P-labeled cHMGI protein were digested with proteinase Glu-C (A) or trypsin (B). The degradation products were separated by HPLC and identified by amino acid analysis. The numbers at the peaks indicate the corresponding amino acid residues in the cHMGI protein. Also shown is the alignment of the identified cHMGI fragments obtained by cleavage with proteinase Glu-C and trypsin (C). The sequence of the protein is from Claus et al. (11Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid residues of the putative DNA-binding motifs are boxed. The mapped sites of in vivo phosphorylation are indicated byasterisks. The peptides obtained by digestion with proteinase Glu-C and trypsin are designated as in A andB, with lower- and upper-case letters, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 4 A shows the amounts of phosphopeptides containing phosphorylated Ser3and Ser22, respectively, which were obtained by digestion of the cHMGI fraction isolated from normally growing and metaphase-arrested cells. In comparison to rapidly growing cell cultures, a significant increase in phosphorylation at Ser(P)3 was observed in cHMGI extracted from mitotically blocked cells, whereas the amount of the peptide containing Ser(P)22 remained almost unchanged. This result strongly suggests that Ser3, but not Ser22, is anin vivo substrate for Cdc2 kinase. Bacterially expressed cHMGI and [Ser(P)22]peptide 1–32 were efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by Cdc2 kinase (Fig. 4 B). The sites of phosphorylation in the entire protein and the synthetic [Ser(P)22]peptide 1–32 mapped to peptides 1–19 (Fig.5 A) and 3–19 (data not shown). This indicated that Ser3 was the sole site of phosphorylation. To check the possibility that the lack of phosphorylation at Ser22 under in vitroconditions is due to inaccessibility of Ser22 to the kinase, we assayed Cdc2 activity using a synthetic peptide 13–32. The observed rate of phosphorylation of this peptide was rather low (Fig.4 B). These results indicate that Ser3 is the sole Cdc2 kinase phosphorylation site in the cHMGI protein.Figure 5In vitro phosphorylation of cHMGI by Cdc2 (A), MAP (B), and PKC (C) kinases. The radioactively phosphorylated protein was digested with proteinase Glu-C. The degradation products were separated on a reverse-phase C18 column using a 0–257 CH3CN gradient in 25 min. The fractions were collected, and their radioactivity was determined. The identity of the separated peaks was determined by amino acid analysis. Shown in the inset inC is the separation of tryptic peptides obtained by digestion of the isolated phosphopeptide i (residues 48–93) (see Fig. 3 C).

Exp. Cell Res. 1982; 139: 309-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Since this developmental process is concomitant with the changes in activities of MAP kinases (24Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4245) Google Scholar) and because Ser22matches the (S/T)*P consensus substrate sequence of these kinases (25Cobb M. Hardie G. Hanks S. The Protein Kinase Facts Book I. Academic Press Ltd., London1996: 214-216Google Scholar), we checked whether cHMGI is a substrate for MAP (Erk-2) kinase. This enzyme indeed efficiently phosphorylated cHMGI, and peptide mapping revealed that Ser22 was in fact the major site of phosphorylation (Fig. 5 B). The rate of phosphorylation at Ser3, which also matches the MAP kinase consensus sequence, was found to occur at an ∼3 times lower rate. In an in vivo experiment, we observed a reduction of the extent of both the singly and doubly phosphorylated forms in the presence of a specific MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, 2′-amino-3′-methoxyflavone (PD 98059) (26Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Satiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3259) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 C). Densitometric quantification of the gel lanes revealed that the ratios of the unphosphorylated, singly phosphorylated, and doubly phosphorylated forms of the protein were 1:0.62:0.10 and 1:0.36:0.03 in the control and inhibited samples, respectively (data not shown). Since the role of MAP kinase kinase in the activation of MAP kinase is well characterized, it seems that phosphorylation of cHMGI at Ser22 and Ser3 is under the control of the MAP kinase pathway. The phosphorylation site at Ser72 matches the (S/T)*X(K/R) consensus substrate sequence of PKC (27Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Ser72 was found to be the only PKC phosphorylation site in the cHMGI protein (Fig. 5 C). Thus, it seems very probable that the cHMGI protein is a substrate for PKC in vivo. Further studies are necessary, however, to understand the functional consequence(s) of this modification. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that the mammalian HMGI/Y proteins are substrates for Cdc2 kinase (10Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Reeves R. Langan T.A. Nissen M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1671-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Peptide mapping of thein vivo labeled HMGI protein revealed, however, that in exponentially growing cells, the major phosphorylation site was different from the Cdc2 site (10Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possibility that HMGI is a substrate for MAP kinase, we have phosphorylated the human proteinin vitro. Indeed, we observed an efficient phosphorylation of the HMGI protein by this enzyme. Peptide mapping revealed a single site of phosphorylation (Fig.6 A). For comparison, the protein was modified with Cdc2 kinase. In agreement with previous data (10Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), two sites of phosphorylation were observed (Fig. 6 B). On the basis of the retention times, one of these sites was identical to the MAP kinase site. In particular cases, as in the case of Iκ-B, protein phosphorylation initiates a process of protein degradation (28Traenckner E.B.-M. Pahl H.L. Henkel T. Schmidt K.N. Wilk S. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2876-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). To test the idea that phosphorylation at Ser22 reduces the in vivo stability of the cHMGI protein, we compared the turnover rates of cHMGI and its phosphorylated forms. The HMG proteins were labeled in vivo with tritiated lysine, and after removal of the radioactive amino acid, the titers of the incorporated label were determined daily during a 4-day period. The changes in the content of incorporated radioactivity in the unphosphorylated and phosphorylated cHMGI forms were similar (Fig.7). This suggests that the phosphorylation of cHMGI does not affect the turnover rate of the protein. The phosphorylation of mammalian HMGI/Y proteins leads to reduced DNA binding affinity (10Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The loss of the binding affinity is salt-dependent and reaches the highest extent at physiological ionic strength (10Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the changes in the DNA binding strength of cHMGI upon phosphorylation, we isolated the unphosphorylated cHMGI protein and the [Ser(P)22]cHMGI protein by rechromatographing fractions 4–5 and 7–9, respectively (Fig. 2 A). The other phosphoforms were obtained in vitro by phosphorylation of cHMGI and [Ser(P)22]cHMGI by Cdc2 kinase. Subsequent HPLC purification yielded >907 pure [Ser(P)3]cHMGI and [Ser(P)3,Ser(P)22]cHMGI proteins (data not shown). DNA binding was assayed by mobility shift assay. Single phosphorylation at serine 3 or 22 (Fig.8, B and C) did not lead to any significant change in the DNA binding strength under physiological (180 mm) (Fig. 8, A–D) or low salt (80 mm) (data not shown) conditions. In contrast, phosphorylation of cHMGI at both serine residues resulted in a dramatic change in the DNA binding properties under both physiological and low salt conditions (Fig. 8, D and F). A 5–10-fold concentration of [Ser(P)3,Ser(P)22]cHMGI was found to be necessary for shifting 507 of the DNA as compared with the unphosphorylated or singly phosphorylated protein. The absence of the sharp shifted bands, which are characteristic for thermodynamically stable protein-DNA complexes, was also characteristic for binding of [Ser(P)3,Ser(P)22]cHMGI to DNA (Fig. 8,D and F). The HMGI/Y proteins are thought to play a role in the assembly of enhancer complexes of a number of genes (reviewed in Ref. 3Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in the organization of scaffold-associated regions of chromosomes (29Zhao K. Käs E. Gonzalez E. Laemmli U.K. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3237-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence studies using interphase chromosomes ofChironomus indicated that the HMGI protein is present in sites of transcriptional activity, e.g. puffs and nucleoli (13Ghidelli S. Claus P. Thies G. Wiśniewski J.R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 105: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, HMGI/Y appear to be associated with AT-rich constitutive heterochromatin in metaphase chromosomes (30Disney J.E. Johnson K.R. Magnuson N.S. Sylvester S.R. Reeves R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1975-1982Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Since cHMGI and its phosphoforms exhibit very low turnover rates (Ref. 13Ghidelli S. Claus P. Thies G. Wiśniewski J.R. Chromosoma (Berl.). 1997; 105: 369-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and this work), post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation could serve as mechanisms that govern the cell cycle-dependent and extracellular signal-dependent changes in the chromosomal location of this protein. Furthermore, our results show that cHMGI is a substrate for Cdc2, MAP, and PKC kinases in vivo and in vitro, which may indicate a functional versatility of this protein. Despite the large evolutionary distance between insects and mammals, the essential properties of HMGI/Y have been conserved. These include the presence of three AT-hook domains and their binding properties (11Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Wiśniewski J.R. Grossbach U. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1996; 40: 177-187PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the distribution of charged residues in insect, human, and murine HMGI/Y proteins is strikingly similar (Fig. 9 A). (i) All AT-hook motifs exhibit the same +4 positive charge (the only exception is the third motif of cHMGI with charge +3). (ii) The net charge of the almost amphipathic protein regions in front of the first and between the first and second AT-hook is −1, 0, or +1. Thus, double phosphorylation, which adds four negative charges adjacent to the AT-hook, could compensate positive charges of the DNA-binding motif and in this way lead to a loss of its binding activity. (iii) Interestingly, in vivo, bothChironomus HMGI (this work) and murine HMGY (9Reeves R. Nissen M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8573-8582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) proteins were found to be phosphorylated at three sites that are interspersed with the AT-hook motifs. In previous studies, the effects of phosphorylation of the human HMGI protein on the protein binding to DNA were analyzed using a competition assay that employs the minor groove-binding fluorescent dye Hoechst 33258 (10Nissen M.S. Langan T.A. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19945-19952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this work, we have analyzed the binding properties of cHMGI and its three phosphoforms directly using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay and have shown that, in Chironomus, a two-step phosphorylation process leads to reduction of the DNA binding affinity of the HMGI protein. Since the HMGI/Y proteins are involved in protein-protein contacts, the single phosphorylation at Ser22 of cHMGI by MAP kinase, which apparently does not influence the strength of its DNA binding, may reflect changes in the ability of cHMGI to interact with other proteins and may facilitate the organization of particular higher order structures, such as the enhancer complex of the interferon-ॆ gene in human (32Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this complex also involves c-Jun and ATF-2 transcription factors, which are well characterized substrates for c-Jun N-terminal kinase, a member of the MAP kinase family (33Gupta S. Campbell D. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1339) Google Scholar, 34Gupta S. Berret T. Whitmarsh A.J. Cavanagh J. Sluss H.K. Dérijard B. Davis R.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (1183) Google Scholar), suggesting that HMGI activity is regulated in a way common to other transcriptional regulators. The spatial organization of the three AT-hook motifs of the HMGI/Y proteins in the complex with DNA is unknown. Previously, we have demonstrated that at least two of these motifs are necessary for high affinity interaction of cHMGI with DNA (11Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a more recent work, Maher and Nathans (35Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have shown that tight binding of the HMGI protein to DNA uses two or three appropriately spaced AT tracts. The double phosphorylation of the cHMGI protein decreased the DNA binding affinity and led to the disappearance of distinct complexes in electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments. This is reminiscent of the DNA binding properties of peptide 48–86 of cHMGI (11Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This peptide contains two putative DNA-binding motifs and does not generate distinct complexes migrating in sharp bands. In addition, its affinity was reduced by about an order of magnitude. These similarities suggest that the double phosphorylation abolishes binding of the amino-terminally located AT-hook motif to DNA (Fig.9 B). As the appropriate length and spacing of the AT tracts are a prerequisite for high affinity interaction of the HMGI/Y proteins with DNA (35Maher J.F. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), the impairment of the trivalent interaction between cHMGI and DNA would increase the mobility of the protein on the DNA and increase a number of possible divalent interactions (Fig.9 B). Since the probability of the occurrence of two appropriately spaced AT tracts in chromosomes is higher than that of three appropriately spaced tracts, a phosphorylation process would facilitate dissociation of the HMGI/Y proteins from one type of sites and binding to other sites on DNA. The disappearance of the distinctly shifted bands in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay as an effect of double phosphorylation of cHMGI may reflect impairment of the trivalent complexes. The strong smears probably represent the divalent complexes, which exhibit reduced thermodynamic stability and/or increased flexibility on the DNA. Both human and insect HMGI proteins bind preferentially to four-way junction DNA (11Claus P. Schulze E. Wiśniewski J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33042-33048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This property is also known for the linker histone H1, and it probably reflects the ability of histone H1 to bind the DNA at sites where it enters and exits the nucleosome (36Varga-Weisz P. van Holde K. Zlatanova J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20699-20700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Varga-Weisz P. Zlatanova J. Leuba S.H. Schroth G.P. van Holde K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3525-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, competition between HMGI and histone H1 for this binding site could contribute to establishing two different types of chromatin: the transcriptionally active one (which would contain cHMGI) and the silent one (which would be rich in histone H1). (Such a competition model has also been suggested for the assembly of inactive and active chromatin by histone H1 and the HMG1 protein (38van Holde K. Zlatanova J. Arents G. Moundrianakis E. Elgin S.C.R. Chromatin Structure and Gene Expression. IRL Press Ltd., Oxford1994: 1-26Google Scholar).) The phosphorylation of cHMGI could participate in the regulation of this process. The resulting reduction of the DNA binding affinity of the HMGI/Y proteins may also be linked to an increase in another activity, such as the ability to bind to a positively charged histone. Such a charge compensation within the 30-nm nucleosomal fiber could participate in higher order chromatin compaction in metaphase chromosomes. In such a model, the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated proteins would be specific for condensed and transcriptionally active chromatin, respectively. Unfortunately, to date, no information is available on the localization of individual phosphorylated forms and unmodified HMGI/Y in the nucleus. Further studies employing antibodies that are specific for phosphoforms of HMGI and experiments utilizing the kinases involved in this phosphorylation process can probably help us to understand the biological meaning of the phosphorylation of the HMGI/Y proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2069398764,"The potent synthetic fluoroquinolones and the natural CcdB protein encoded by the F plasmid both inhibit bacterial growth by attacking DNA gyrase and by stimulating enzyme-induced breaks in bacterial DNA. The cleavage mechanisms of these structurally diverse compounds were analyzed by purifying and characterizing stable ternary complexes of enoxacin and CcdB protein with gyrase bound to a strong gyrase binding site from bacteriophage Mu. Three differences between enoxacin- and CcdB-derived complexes were discovered. 1) Enoxacin binds to the DNA active site and alters the breakage/reunion activity of the enzyme. CcdB binds gyrase-DNA complexes but does not influence enzymatic activity directly. 2) Complexes that produce DNA cleavage with enoxacin are reversible, whereas similar complexes made with CcdB protein are not. 3) Enoxacin stimulates cleavage of both relaxed and supercoiled forms of DNA in the absence of ATP, whereas CcdB induces cleavage only after many cycles of ATP-dependent breakage and reunion. These differences in mechanisms can be explained by a model in which enoxacin induces formation of a novel 舠cleavable舡 complex, whereas CcdB protein traps a very rare 舠cleaved舡 conformation of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1971835989,"Elongin C is a 112-amino acid protein that is found in mammalian cells as a positive regulatory subunit of heterotrimeric RNA polymerase II elongation factor Elongin (SIII) and as a component of a multiprotein complex containing the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor protein. As a subunit of the Elongin complex, Elongin C interacts directly with the transcriptionally active Elongin A subunit and potently induces its elongation activity; in addition, Elongin C interacts with the ubiquitin-like Elongin B subunit, which regulates the interaction of Elongin C with Elongin A. As a component of the VHL complex, Elongin C interacts directly with both Elongin B and the VHL protein. Binding of the VHL protein to Elongin C was found to prevent Elongin C from interacting with and activating Elongin A <i>in vitro</i>, leading to the proposal that one function of the VHL protein may be to regulate RNA polymerase II elongation by negatively regulating the Elongin complex. In this report, we identify Elongin C sequences required for its interaction with the VHL protein. We previously demonstrated that the ability of Elongin C to bind and activate Elongin A is sensitive to mutations in the C-terminal half of Elongin C, as well as to mutations in an N-terminal Elongin C region needed for formation of the Elongin BC complex. Here we show that interaction of Elongin C with the VHL tumor suppressor protein depends strongly on sequences in the C terminus of Elongin C but is independent of the N-terminal Elongin C region required for binding to Elongin B and for binding and activation of Elongin A. Taken together, our results are consistent with the proposal that the VHL protein negatively regulates Elongin C activation of the Elongin complex by sterically blocking the interaction of C-terminal Elongin C sequences with Elongin A. In addition, our finding that only a subset of Elongin C sequences required for its interaction with Elongin A are critical for binding to VHL may offer the opportunity to develop reagents that selectively interfere with Elongin and VHL function."

As is the case for most terrestrial vertebrates, garter snakes possess dual olfactory systems, a main olfactory apparatus and a vomeronasal system. However, unlike most other vertebrates, the vomeronasal systems of most snakes are better developed than their main olfactory systems (2Gabe M. Saint Girons H. Mem. Mus. Nat. Hist. Nat. Paris Ser. A. 1976; 98: 1-87Google Scholar). Snakes appear to be dependent on vomeronasal input for a wide variety of behaviors requiring responses to chemical signals (3Parson T.S. Gans C. Parsons T.S. Biology of the Reptilia. 2. Academic Press, New York1970: 99-191Google Scholar). In addition, the two olfactory sensory systems play distinct functional roles in detecting environmental stimuli. The olfactory system detects mainly volatile compounds while the vomeronasal system detects primarily nonvolatile substances. Garter snakes detect prey, such as earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris), with their vomeronasal systems (4Burghardt G.M. Pruitt C.H. Physiol.

A chemoattractive protein, ES20, derived from electric shock-induced earthworm secretion, was isolated, purified, and characterized to a considerable extent (1Jiang X.C. Inouchi J. Wang D. Halpern M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8736-8744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When the vomeronasal organ is irrigated with an aqueous solution of ES20, it induces an increase in the firing rate of mitral cells in the accessory olfactory bulb, the postsynaptic target of receptor cells of the vomeronasal epithelium (1Jiang X.C. Inouchi J. Wang D. Halpern M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8736-8744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Inouchi J. Wang D. Jiang X.C. Kubie J. Halpern M. Brain Behav.

The chemoattractive protein, ES20, binds to vomeronasal epithelial membrane in a saturable and reversable manner with a K d value of 0.3 ॖm (1Jiang X.C. Inouchi J. Wang D. Halpern M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8736-8744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of ES20 is tissue-specific, and both the binding and the bioactivity of this chemoattractive protein require the presence of Ca2+ (14Luo Y. Lu S. Chen P. Wang D. Halpern M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16867-16877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When ES20 binds to its G protein-coupled receptors on the vomeronasal receptor cell membranes, the intracellular level of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is increased while that of cAMP is decreased (14Luo Y. Lu S. Chen P. Wang D. Halpern M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16867-16877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Wang D. Chen P. Liu W. Li C.S. Halpern M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). The level of cAMP is regulated mainly by calcium ions rather than by inhibitory G protein or cAMP-phosphodiesterase (15Wang D. Chen P. Liu W. Li C.S. Halpern M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar). To facilitate the elucidation of the nature and mechanism of interaction between chemoattractant and its receptors that generate a chemoreceptive signal, it is necessary to have molecular and structural information concerning the chemoattractive protein as well as its receptors. Since a partial amino acid sequence of ES20 protein was previously reported (1Jiang X.C. Inouchi J. Wang D. Halpern M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8736-8744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), degenerative oligonucleotide primers were synthesized and utilized to clone the gene that encodes this chemoattractive protein. In this communication, we report the cloning of the gene encoding ES20 and its deduced amino acid sequence. The fusion ES20 protein was recognized by polyclonal antibodies specific for the native ES20 protein and was active in a bioassay for chemoattractivity to garter snakes.MATERIALS AND METHODSThe reagents were obtained from various suppliers: TRIzol and reverse transcriptase from Life Technologies, Inc.; UniZAPTM XR vector and XL1-Blue MRF′ host from Stratagene; poly(A)+ RNA isolation kit and pCRTM II from Invitrogen; [32P]dCTP, DNA sequence kit, and ECL kit (horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody) from Amersham Corp.; Taq polymerase from Boehringer Mannheim; pQE30 expression vector and M15[pREP4] cells from QIAGEN; and earthworms from Connecticut Valley Biological Supply; garter snakes from various suppliers.Poly(A)+ mRNA IsolationTotal RNA was prepared from 5 g of earthworm tissues as follows. Freshly dissected earthworm tissues were pulverized by grinding under liquid nitrogen. To the ground tissues, 10 ml of TRIzol were added and allowed to thaw at room temperature. The thawed mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min. It was transferred into a Falcon 2059 plastic tube, mixed with 2 ml of chloroform, and then centrifuged. The supernatant was carefully transferred into a new tube, and the RNA was precipitated by mixing with 5 ml of isopropyl alcohol. Poly(A)+ mRNA was isolated from total RNA according to the procedures described in the manual for poly(A)+mRNA isolation kit (Invitrogen).cDNA Library ConstructionThe construction of a cDNA library was performed according to standard procedures of Sambrook et al. (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1989: 8.3-8.81Google Scholar) using UniZAPTM XR vector (Stratagene) and XL1-Blue MRF′ host. A cDNA library containing 5 × 106 recombinants in sense orientation was achieved. One fifth of the recombinants (1 × 106) were amplified to 1 × 1011 plaque-forming units/ml.PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside. 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-ॆ-d-galactopyranoside. Amplification of ES20 Gene from cDNA LibraryThe ES20 cDNA from the recombinants (1 × 106) was cloned by performing degenerative oligonucleotides-primed amplification. Two oligonucleotides, GCI CTI GTI TGT CCI CCI GGI TTT ACI TAT and GTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG C, were used, respectively, as a sense degenerative primer and antisense T7 primer. The sense primer corresponds to the amino acid sequence ALVCPPGFTY of chemoattractive protein ES20. PCR was performed in 50 ॖl of PCR buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.0017 gelatin) containing 200 ॖm each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim), and 2 ॖm of each primer. Amplifications were carried out according to the following schedule: 94 °C for 1 min, 38 °C for 3 min, and 72 °C for 3 min (four cycles); 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 2 min and 72 °C for 2 min (30 cycles). PCR products were analyzed with 100-bp ladder DNA markers by agarose (1.47) gel electrophoresis. A 700-bp PCR product was gel-isolated and cloned into pCRTM II (Invitrogen). The clones were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. The recombinant is referred to as pCR-ES20.Determination of the cDNA Sequence of ES20 ClonesThe cDNA of ES20 clones was sequenced by dideoxy-mediated chain termination according to the method of Sanger et al.(17Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52310) Google Scholar).Northern Blot AnalysisA 200-bp EcoRI fragment of pCR-ES20 was purified, labeled with [32P]dCTP, and used as a probe for Northern blot analysis. Earthworm total RNA (10 ॖg) and mRNA (50 ng) were size-fractionated on a 1.37 agarose formaldehyde gel, blotted onto a nylon membrane, and cross-linked to the membrane under UV irradiation. Prehybridization was performed in 507 formamide, 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.47 SDS, and 100 ॖg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 45 °C for 4 h and hybridization at 45 °C overnight in a similar solution but containing the ES20probe. Hybridized membrane was washed under high stringency conditions.cDNA Library ScreeningThe 200-bp EcoRI fragment of pCR-ES20 labeled with 32P was used as a gene-specific probe for screening the cDNA library. A total of 1 × 106 plaques were screened under high stringency conditions. Four positive clones were isolated following secondary and tertiary screenings. They were excised as pSK(−) from UniZAPTM XR, and referred to as pSK-ES20. A 702-bp sequence was determined, and the complete amino acid sequence of 208 residues was deduced from the coding region.ES20 Gene Expression in E. coli CellsThe ES20gene was excised from pSK-ES20 and amplified by PCR using a gene-specific sense primer containing a BamHI site and an antisense primer containing a HindIII site. Both the pQE30 expression vector (QIAGEN) and PCR-amplified ES20 DNA were digested by BamHI and HindIII, purified, ligated, and subsequently transformed into JM 109 cells for the purpose of selecting the correct insertion of the coding fragment. The selected recombinant plasmids were transformed into expression host cell, M15[pREP4], in a medium containing appropriate antibiotics for selection. Three transformants were selected and induced with IPTG for recombinant gene expression. An expressed 20-kDa fusion protein (linked with 6 residues of His) was purified under denaturing conditions by affinity chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin. The purified protein was refolded by dialyzing against stepwise dilutions of the denaturant. Such refolded recombinant protein was analyzed by Western immunoblot against ES20-specific polyclonal antibodies using an horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibody (Amersham Corp.) for detection with an ECL kit (Amersham Corp.).Protein DeterminationThe concentration of protein was estimated using the Micro BCA protein assay reagent and bovine serum albumin as a standard.Snake BioassayThe snake bioassay was conducted by following the procedures of Jiang et al. (1Jiang X.C. Inouchi J. Wang D. Halpern M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8736-8744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, test samples (200 ॖl of 53.8 ॖm fusion ES20 protein or native ES20 protein) or control solution (200 ॖl of a similar fraction prepared from uninduced Escherichia coli cells) was evenly applied to the surface of a piece of artificial plastic earthworm, which had been glued to a circular plastic disk and presented to a snake in its home cage. The response of the snake to the test material was monitored visually. A positive response was recorded when the snake approached and attacked the worm bit. If the snake approached the dish twice without attacking the worm bit, the response was considered negative.DISCUSSIONEarthworms, a primary prey of garter snakes, contain a number of proteins attractive to garter snakes. The recognition of and response to these chemoattractive proteins is mediated by the garter snake's vomeronasal system (5Halpern M. Frumin N. Physiol. Behav. 1979; 22: 1183-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Kubie J.L. Halpern M. J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1979; 93: 648-667Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Kubie J.L. Halpern M. J. Comp. Physiol. Psychol. 1978; 92: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Several of these chemoattractants have been isolated, purified, and characterized (1Jiang X.C. Inouchi J. Wang D. Halpern M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8736-8744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wang D. Chen P. Jiang X.C. Halpern M. Arch. Biochem.

Halpern M. Brain Behav. Evol. 1993; 41: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The recognition of the prey is presumably initiated by the binding of one or several chemoattractants to their receptors on vomeronasal sensory neurons. Two of the purified chemoattractive proteins, ES20 and EW3, when delivered as aqueous washes to the vomeronasal sensory epithelium, have been shown to generate action potentials in the mitral cell layer of the accessory olfactory bulb of garter snakes (1Jiang X.C. Inouchi J. Wang D. Halpern M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8736-8744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Inouchi J. Wang D. Jiang X.C. Kubie J. Halpern M. Brain Behav.

Furthermore, the binding of ES20 and its G protein-coupled receptor(s) results in generation of second messengers (14Luo Y. Lu S. Chen P. Wang D. Halpern M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16867-16877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and appears to involve cross-talk between two second messenger pathways (15Wang D. Chen P. Liu W. Li C.S. Halpern M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; (in press)Google Scholar).Since earthworms contain many proteins attractive to garter snakes, whether these proteins bind to a single type of receptor or to different subtypes of receptors is not yet known. Do these chemoattractive proteins possess a similar type of receptor-binding domain or different types of domains? To answer these questions, a knowledge of structure-function relationships between ligands and receptors is needed. It is therefore necessary to elucidate the molecular structures of both the ligands and their specific receptors. Toward this end, we have successfully cloned the gene for one chemoattractive protein, the ES20 gene. This clone is the first and only chemoattractive gene that has become available and undoubtedly more chemoattractive genes are needed to map their binding domains. We have been studying chemosignal transduction in the vomeronasal system using garter snakes (Thamnophis sp.) as model subjects. As is the case for most terrestrial vertebrates, garter snakes possess dual olfactory systems, a main olfactory apparatus and a vomeronasal system. However, unlike most other vertebrates, the vomeronasal systems of most snakes are better developed than their main olfactory systems (2Gabe M. Saint Girons H. Mem. Mus. Nat. Hist. Nat. Paris Ser. A. 1976; 98: 1-87Google Scholar). Snakes appear to be dependent on vomeronasal input for a wide variety of behaviors requiring responses to chemical signals (3Parson T.S. Gans C. Parsons T.S. Biology of the Reptilia. 2. Academic Press, New York1970: 99-191Google Scholar). In addition, the two olfactory sensory systems play distinct functional roles in detecting environmental stimuli. The olfactory system detects mainly volatile compounds while the vomeronasal system detects primarily nonvolatile substances. Garter snakes detect prey, such as earthworms (Lumbricus terrestris), with their vomeronasal systems (4Burghardt G.M. Pruitt C.H. Physiol. Behav. 1975; 14: 185-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 5Halpern M. Frumin N. Physiol. Behav. 1979; 22: 1183-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 6Kubie J.L. Halpern M. J.
