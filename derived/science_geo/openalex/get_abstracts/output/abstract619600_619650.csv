https://openalex.org/W2231272853,"Randomness is important for many information processing applications, including numerical modelling and cryptography1,2. Device-independent quantum random-number generation (DIQRNG)3,4 based on the loophole-free violation of a Bell inequality produces genuine, unpredictable randomness without requiring any assumptions about the inner workings of the devices, and is therefore an ultimate goal in the field of quantum information science5–7. Previously reported experimental demonstrations of DIQRNG8,9 were not provably secure against the most general adversaries or did not close the ‘locality’ loophole of the Bell test. Here we present DIQRNG that is secure against quantum and classical adversaries10–12. We use state-of-the-art quantum optical technology to create, modulate and detect entangled photon pairs, achieving an efficiency of more than 78 per cent from creation to detection at a distance of about 200 metres that greatly exceeds the threshold for closing the ‘detection’ loophole of the Bell test. By independently and randomly choosing the base settings for measuring the entangled photon pairs and by ensuring space-like separation between the measurement events, we also satisfy the no-signalling condition and close the ‘locality’ loophole of the Bell test, thus enabling the realization of the loophole-free violation of a Bell inequality. This, along with a high-voltage, high-repetition-rate Pockels cell modulation set-up, allows us to accumulate sufficient data in the experimental time to extract genuine quantum randomness that is secure against the most general adversaries. By applying a large (137.90 gigabits × 62.469 megabits) Toeplitz-matrix hashing technique, we obtain 6.2469 × 107 quantum-certified random bits in 96 hours with a total failure probability (of producing a random number that is not guaranteed to be perfectly secure) of less than 10−5. Our demonstration is a crucial step towards transforming DIQRNG from a concept to a key aspect of practical applications that require high levels of security and thus genuine randomness7. Our work may also help to improve our understanding of the origin of randomness from a fundamental perspective. Genuine, unpredictable quantum random-number generation that is provably secure against quantum and classical adversaries is demonstrated, certified by the loophole-free violation of a Bell inequality."
https://openalex.org/W2894695144,"In response to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, three ER transmembrane signaling proteins, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), PRKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6α (ATF6α), are activated. These proteins initiate a signaling and transcriptional network termed the unfolded protein response (UPR), which re-establishes cellular proteostasis. When this restoration fails, however, cells undergo apoptosis. To investigate cross-talk between these different UPR enzymes, here we developed a high-content live cell screening platform to image fluorescent UPR-reporter cell lines derived from human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells in which different ER stress signaling proteins were silenced through lentivirus-delivered shRNA constructs. We observed that loss of ATF6 expression results in uncontrolled IRE1-reporter activity and increases X box–binding protein 1 (XBP1) splicing. Transient increases in both IRE1 mRNA and IRE1 protein levels were observed in response to ER stress, suggesting that IRE1 up-regulation is a general feature of ER stress signaling and was further increased in cells lacking ATF6 expression. Moreover, overexpression of the transcriptionally active N-terminal domain of ATF6 reversed the increases in IRE1 levels. Furthermore, inhibition of IRE1 kinase activity or of downstream JNK activity prevented an increase in IRE1 levels during ER stress, suggesting that IRE1 transcription is regulated through a positive feed-forward loop. Collectively, our results indicate that from the moment of activation, IRE1 signaling during ER stress has an ATF6-dependent “off-switch.” In response to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) lumen, three ER transmembrane signaling proteins, inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), PRKR-like ER kinase (PERK), and activating transcription factor 6α (ATF6α), are activated.

Rather than being decisive for cell fate, ATF6 signaling has been proposed to convey adaption to long-term chronic stress (3Wu J. Rutkowski D.T. Dubois M. Swathirajan J. Saunders T. Wang J. Song B.

IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 are kept in an inactive state through association with ER chaperone BiP (5Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L.M. Harding H.P. Ron D.

As unfolded proteins accumulate in the ER, BiP dissociates allowing for the activation of the three transmembrane signaling factors. ATF6α is initially trafficked to the Golgi where it is sequentially cleaved by the proteases SP1 and SP2 (6Ye J. Rawson R.B. Komuro R. Chen X. Davé U.P. Prywes R. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. ER stress induces cleavage of membrane-bound ATF6 by the same proteases that process SREBPs.Mol.

The N-terminal cytosolic fragment of ATF6 functions as a transcription factor and forms heterodimers with other factors such as XBP1. Transcriptional targets of ATF6 are cytoprotective ER chaperones and ERAD components, including BiP (4Shoulders M.D. Ryno L.M. Genereux J.C. Moresco J.J. Tu P.G. Wu C. Yates 3rd., J.R. Su A.I.

Deletion of ATF6 was sufficient to attenuate ER stress–induced BiP expression (7Yamamoto K. Sato T. Matsui T. Sato M. Okada T. Yoshida H. Harada A. Mori K. Transcriptional induction of mammalian ER quality control proteins is mediated by single or combined action of ATF6α and XBP1.Dev.

Furthermore, ATF6 was shown to regulate transcription of Xbp1 (8Lee K. Tirasophon W. Shen X. Michalak M. Prywes R. Okada T. Yoshida H. Mori K. Kaufman R.J. IRE1-mediated unconventional mRNA splicing and S2P-mediated ATF6 cleavage merge to regulate XBP1 in signaling the unfolded protein response.Genes Dev. 2002; 16 (11850408): 452-46610.1101/gad.964702Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar), which is spliced into an active transcription factor through IRE1. Following BiP dissociation, IRE1 oligomerizes within the ER membrane (9Li H. Korennykh A.V. Behrman S.L. Walter P. Mammalian endoplasmic reticulum stress sensor IRE1 signals by dynamic clustering.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107 (20798350): 16113-1611810.1073/pnas.1010580107Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Oligomerization enables transautophosphorylation, which in turn activates the cytosolic endonuclease domain of IRE1 (10Han D. Lerner A.G. Vande Walle L. Upton J.P. Xu W. Hagen A. Backes B.J. Oakes S.A. Papa F.R. IRE1α kinase activation modes control alternate endoribonuclease outputs to determine divergent cell fates.Cell. 2009; 138 (19665977): 562-57510.1016/j.cell.2009.07.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). The primary target of the IRE1 endonuclease activity is Xbp1 mRNA, splicing of which enables the translation of the active transcription factor XBP1. Thus, the IRE1 and ATF6 pathways converge on regulation of Xbp1-dependent signaling outputs, which includes ER chaperones and ERAD components (11Calfon M. Zeng H. Urano F. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R.

IRE1 has also been shown to process other mRNAs, including its own, in a process termed regulated IRE1–dependent decay (14Hollien J. Weissman J.S.

Additionally the cytosolic domain of phosphorylated IRE1 can recruit the adapter protein TNF receptor 2 (TRAF2), triggering the ASK1/JNK cascade (17Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Coupling of stress in the ER to activation of JNK protein kinases by transmembrane protein kinase IRE1.Science. 2000; 287 (10650002): 664-66610.1126/science.287.5453.664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). The timing of these different Ire1-signaling outputs is not well-understood. It has been suggested that the shift from splicing of Xbp1 to the more promiscuous degradation of mRNAs constitutes a switch from pro-survival to pro-apoptotic signaling (10Han D. Lerner A.G. Vande Walle L. Upton J.P. Xu W. Hagen A. Backes B.J. Oakes S.A. Papa F.R. IRE1α kinase activation modes control alternate endoribonuclease outputs to determine divergent cell fates.Cell. 2009; 138 (19665977): 562-57510.1016/j.cell.2009.07.017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Similarly, activation of the ASK/JNK cascade has been interpreted as a pro-apoptotic signal (18Hetz C. Glimcher L.H.

During prolonged ER stress, IRE1-mediated splicing is eventually attenuated (1Lin J.H. Li H. Yasumura D. Cohen H.R. Zhang C. Panning B. Shokat K.M. Lavail M.M. Walter P. IRE1 signaling affects cell fate during the unfolded protein response.Science. 2007; 318 (17991856): 944-94910.1126/science.1146361Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 19Walter F. Schmid J.

This occurred independently of the availability of the unspliced Xbp1 mRNA substrate and despite continuous ER stress. To investigate in more detail the role of ATF6 signaling in relation to ER stress responses and cell survival, we here employed our recently established and characterized ER stress reporter cell lines (19Walter F. Schmid J. Düssmann H. Concannon C.G. Prehn J.H. Imaging of single cell responses to ER stress indicates that the relative dynamics of IRE1/XBP1 and PERK/ATF4 signalling rather than a switch between signalling branches determine cell survival.Cell Death Differ. 2015; 22 (25633195): 1502-151610.1038/cdd.2014.241Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and monitored their responses to silencing of UPR components during ER stress using time-lapse live cell imaging. We identified cross-talk between IRE1 and ATF6 signaling and demonstrated that from the moment of activation, the ER stress signaling machinery contains an ATF6-dependent “off-switch.” To explore the UPR-signaling network, we silenced expression of IRE1, PERK, or ATF6 using lentivirus-delivered shRNA constructs in UPR-reporter cell lines. We previously generated and characterized these SH-SY5Y derived cell lines that stably expressed fluorescent reporters for XBP1 splicing, translation of ATF4, or activation of ATF6 (19Walter F.

Neurosci. 2016; 43 (26750440): 640-65210.1111/ejn.13160Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The expression of the fluorescent reporters over time in response to ER stress was monitored using high content live cell imaging. Efficient silencing of ATF6, IRE1, or PERK was confirmed by high-content imaging of ATF6-, IRE1-, or PERK-reporter activity, respectively (Fig. 1, C and D, and Fig. S1, B, C, E, and F) (19Walter F.

Additionally, Western blottings and qPCR were performed to show reduced levels of ATF6 (Fig. 1, A, and B), IRE1, and PERK (Fig. S1, A and D) (19Walter F. Schmid J. Düssmann H. Concannon C.G. Prehn J.H.

In the IRE1-reporter cells, IRE1 endonuclease-mediated splicing of a 26-bp intron from Xbp1–Yfp mRNA in response to ER stress leads to the expression of a spliced XBP1–YFP fusion protein (19Walter F. Schmid J. Düssmann H. Concannon C.G. Prehn J.H. Imaging of single cell responses to ER stress indicates that the relative dynamics of IRE1/XBP1 and PERK/ATF4 signalling rather than a switch between signalling branches determine cell survival.Cell Death Differ. 2015; 22 (25633195): 1502-151610.1038/cdd.2014.241Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We found that suppressing ATF6 expression in these cells resulted in significantly increased levels of YFP-positive cells compared with control cells after treatment with thapsigargin (Tg) (Fig. 2, B and C, and Fig. S2A). Silencing of PERK expression in IRE1-reporter cells decreased the levels of XBP1 splicing. The percentage of YFP-positive cells transduced with shRNA against PERK was similar to control cells initially but decreased compared with the control cells from 20 h after ER stress (Fig. 2E and Fig. S2B). Next, we investigated the effect of silencing ATF6 and IRE1 in the PERK-reporter cells. PERK-reporter cells express three regulatory upstream open reading frames of ATF4 in-frame with YFP from which translation is initiated under ER stress conditions through activation of PERK and subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2α. When monitoring YFP fluorescence levels in response to ER stress in the PERK-reporter cells, we found there was no difference between cells transduced with shRNA against ATF6 or IRE1 and scrambled control (Fig. 2, H, I, K, and L, and Fig. S2, C and D). Finally, we silenced PERK or IRE1 expression in the ATF6-reporter cell line, which stably expressed the ATF6-binding sequence from which transcription of YFP is induced under ER stress conditions (20Nolan K. Walter F. Tuffy L.P. Poeschel S. Gallagher R. Haunsberger S. Bray I. Stallings R.L. Concannon C.G. Prehn J.H. Endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated upregulation of miR-29a enhances sensitivity to neuronal apoptosis.Eur. J.

Although there was no difference in YFP fluorescence levels between cells transduced with shRNA against PERK and control, we found that suppression of IRE1 expression resulted in lower YFP fluorescence in the ATF6-reporter cells (Fig. 2, N, O, R, and Q, and Fig. S2, E and F). Because the above experiments indicated that ATF6 was impacting IRE1-reporter activity, we further investigated the interaction between ATF6 and IRE1. As a first step, we checked whether increased splicing of the IRE1-reporter was observed in ATF6-silenced cells treated with other ER stress–inducing agents. We therefore transduced IRE1-reporter cells with shRNA against ATF6 and treated with tunicamycin (Tm) or brefeldin A (BFA). YFP fluorescence and cell death were monitored using high-content live cell imaging (Fig. 3). The pattern of increase in YFP-positive cells observed over time varied in response to the different ER stress–inducing drugs (Fig. 3, A–D). However, for each treatment we observed a significantly increased amount of XBP1–YFP expression in cells silenced for ATF6 compared with control cells 15 h after stimulus (Fig. 3, B and D). Furthermore, although the initial increase in YFP-positive cells in response to Tm and BFA was similar in ATF6-silenced and control cells, the amount of YFP-positive cells transduced with scrambled construct would eventually plateau and finally decrease, whereas the YFP fluorescence signal in ATF6-silenced cells continued to increase uncontrolled. We next compared cell survival between ATF6-silenced and control cells. Cell death in the IRE1-reporter cells was monitored as percentage of propidium iodide (PI) positively-stained cells over time. Cell death increased from low initial levels after 15 h in BFA-treated cells and after 24 h in Tm- and Tg-treated cells (Fig. 3, E–J). However, there was no difference in the amount or onset of cell death between cells transduced with the ATF6-KD construct or scrambled control for either treatment. Additionally, we investigated cell survival in SH-SY5Y parental cells transduced with shRNA against ATF6. The onset and increase in cell death were similar to the pattern seen in IRE1-reporter cells for Tm and Tg treatments, and we again found no significant difference in the amount of PI-positive cells in response to Tm or Tg between cells silenced for ATF6 or control cells (Fig. S3, A–D). To investigate whether there were differences in early apoptosis events between ATF6-silenced cells and control, cells were treated with Tm and harvested at different time points. Caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 levels were assessed using Western blotting. We could detect a decrease of caspase-3 from 24 h. The amount of cleaved caspase-3 19- and 17-kDa fragments at 40 h was slightly higher in ATF6-KD and scrambled control cells (Fig. S3E). To explore the underlying mechanism for the increase in XBP1 splicing in the IRE1-reporter cells, we silenced ATF6 in parental SH-SY5Y cells and analyzed XBP1 and IRE1 protein levels 4, 8, 16, and 40 h after treatment with Tm by Western blotting (Fig. 4, A and C). Levels of spliced XBP1 were increased in cells transduced with the ATF6-KD construct compared with control cells. Congruently, protein levels of IRE1 and phosphorylated IRE1 were increased in ATF6-silenced cells compared with control cells at 16 and 40 h suggesting higher amounts of activated IRE1 in these cells (Fig. 4, C and F). We did not see an increase in PERK protein levels in the ATF6-silenced cells compared with scram control when treated with Tm for the same times (Fig. S4A). Moreover, there was not a strong difference in eIF2α phosphorylation levels between ATF6-silenced and control cells (Fig. S4A). Analyzing IRE1 protein levels over time, we found that IRE1 increased in response to ER stress (Fig. 4E). ATF6-silenced cells had a higher increase in IRE1 levels compared with control cells, as well as higher amounts of phosphorylated IRE1 and spliced XBP1. We also assessed IRE1 mRNA levels and found them to increase over time in response to ER stress. The increase was higher in ATF6-silenced cells compared with control at 16 and 24 h (Fig. 4B). Similarly, we observed an increase in spliced Xbp1 mRNA that was significantly higher in ATF6-silenced cells compared with scram control 16 and 24 h after treatment (Fig. 4D). Of note, levels of PERK mRNA only showed a small increase over time after exposure to ER stress (Fig. S4B). We went on to assess IRE1 transcription levels in ATF6-silenced SH-SY5Y cells compared with XBP1- and ATF4-KD cells. Loss of expression in these cells was confirmed by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 4, H–J). In response to ER stress, IRE1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in ATF6-silenced cells but not in XBP1-silenced cells or control cells (Fig. 4G). As we observed increased IRE1 protein levels in cells transduced with scrambled control shRNA in response to ER stress (Fig. 4, A and C), we wanted to investigate whether an increase in IRE1 levels was a general response to ER stress. We treated different cell lines with Tm or Tg and monitored IRE1 protein and mRNA levels over time. We found increased IRE1 protein levels after treatment with Tm or Tg in nontransformed SH-SY5Y cells (Fig. 5, A and B), as well as in HEK293TN and SH-EP cells (Fig. S5, A and B). Accumulation of IRE1 protein during ER stress was reported recently to be caused by attenuation of BiP-dependent degradation of IRE1 (22Sun S. Shi G. Sha H. Ji Y. Han X. Shu X. Ma H. Inoue T. Gao B. Kim H. Bu P. Guber R.D. Shen X. Lee A.H. Iwawaki T. et al.IRE1α is an endogenous substrate of endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation.Nat. Cell Biol. 2015; 17 (26551274): 1546-155510.1038/ncb3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, we observed that mRNA levels of IRE1 were elevated in response to Tm or Tg in SH-SY5Y as well as in HEK293TN cells (Fig. 5, C and D, and Fig. S5, C and D), suggesting that transcription was contributing to the accumulation of IRE1 under ER stress. We further tested this by inhibiting translation using cycloheximide (CHX) in Tg-treated SH-SY5Y cells. Although there was some increase in IRE1 protein levels in response to Tg in the CHX-treated cells, it was markedly lower compared with the increase in cells just treated with Tg (Fig. 5E). GRP78 protein levels remained stable over time in the Tg- and CHX-treated cells, confirming effective inhibition of translation. As our data indicated that increases in IRE1 levels under ER stress were due to transcriptional up-regulation, we next wanted to analyze closer the regulation of IRE1 transcription. ER stress is known to be coupled to JNK activation through IRE1 kinase activity and subsequent interaction with TRAF2 (17Urano F. Wang X. Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Chung P. Harding H.P. Ron D. Coupling of stress in the ER to activation of JNK protein kinases by transmembrane protein kinase IRE1.Science. 2000; 287 (10650002): 664-66610.1126/science.287.5453.664Crossref PubMed Scopus (2321) Google Scholar). Recently, the transcription factor JunB was shown to interact with AP1-binding sites in the IRE1 promoter and to be involved in regulation of IRE1 expression during osteoblast differentiation (23Guo F.J. Jiang R. Xiong Z. Xia F. Li M. Chen L. Liu C.J. IRE1a constitutes a negative feedback loop with BMP2 and acts as a novel mediator in modulating osteogenic differentiation.Cell Death Dis. 2014; 5 (24853417)e123910.1038/cddis.2014.194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We thus hypothesized that IRE1 self-regulates its expression under ER stress through the activity of its kinase domain and subsequent activation of JNK and JNK-dependent transcription. To test this hypothesis, we pre-treated SH-SY5Y cells with the JNK inhibitor SP600125 (24Bennett B.L. Sasaki D.T. Murray B.W. O'Leary E.C. Sakata S.T. Xu W. Leisten J.C. Motiwala A. Pierce S.

Biol. 2012; 8 (23086298): 982-98910.1038/nchembio.1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) before inducing ER stress, and we analyzed whether IRE1 levels were affected (Fig. 6, A and B). In cells treated with JNK or IRE1 kinase inhibitor APY29 and Tg, IRE1 protein levels were lower compared with cells treated with Tg, demonstrating that ER stress-dependent induction of IRE1 expression was impaired in these cells. There was no IRE1 phosphorylation detectable in APY29-treated cells, indicating effective inhibition of IRE1 kinase. We also observed lower levels of phosphorylated IRE1 in SP600125-treated cells, which could be due to lower overall IRE1 levels, reduced IRE1 clustering and autophosphorylation, and reduced downstream IRE1 activation. Deficient IRE1 activation was further illustrated by low levels of spliced XBP1 in the SP600125- and APY29-treated cells. c-JUN phosphorylation was reduced in SP600125- and APY29-treated cells compared with Tg only–treated cells, indicating inhibition of JNK and suggesting that IRE1 kinase-dependent phosphorylation was an upstream event. Additionally, we used a second IRE1 kinase inhibitor, KIRA6 (26Ghosh R. Wang L. Wang E.S. Perera B.G. Igbaria A. Morita S. Prado K. Thamsen M. Caswell D. Macias H. Weiberth K.F. Gliedt M.J.

We found little increase in IRE1 levels in cells treated with Tg and KIRA6 (Fig. S6A). We also monitored IRE1 levels in response to ER stress in cells with or without the JNK inhibitor or IRE1 kinase inhibitor KIRA6 over time. In the cells treated with Tm and SP600125, IRE1 protein levels only increased slightly compared with Tm only–treated cells (Fig. 6C). Similarly, we did not see an increase in IRE1 levels in Tm- and KIRA6-treated cells (Fig. S6B). To exclude that the increase in IRE1 expression depended on XBP1 splicing, we treated cells with the IRE1-endonuclease inhibitor 4μ8C (27Cross B.C. Bond P.J. Sadowski P.G. Jha B.K. Zak J.

This research was undertaken to investigate the ecological aspects of human killing and injury, spatial characteristic and pattern of such sites, temporal and seasonal trends of attacks and perception of local communities towards leopard in the Indian Himalayan region (IHR). We surveyed two sites i) Pauri Garhwal in the western part and ii) North Bengal (Dooars) in the eastern part of IHR, compiled secondary data on human-leopard conflict records and made field visits to (N = 101) conflict sites. We also conducted (N = 186) semi-structured questionnaire surveys in each of the sites to assess perception of local communities towards leopard. We analyzed the conflict data using rare events model in a binary logistic regression framework to understand spatial patterns of such incidents for Pauri Garhwal and North Bengal. The average number of injuries and deaths to leopard attacks in Pauri was estimated to be 11 (SE 1.13) and 3 (SE 0.6) per year between 2006–2016 whereas in North Bengal it was estimated to be 70 (SE 9.2) and 1.6 (SE 0.3) respectively between 2004–2016. About 97% of the leopard attacks in North Bengal and 60% of the leopard attacks in Pauri resulted in human injuries. Majority of the leopard attack victims in Pauri were children and young people, whereas in North Bengal it was middle aged tea estate workers. Attack on humans in Pauri were recorded mostly near areas with dense scrub cover whereas in North Bengal it was reported within tea-estates. The percentage of human deaths to leopard attacks in Pauri were higher (40%) compared to a mere (3%) in North Bengal. Forty-one percent of respondents in Pauri and 75% in North Bengal were positive towards presence and conservation of leopard. A predictive risk map revealed central and northern regions of Pauri Garhwal and protected areas, peripheral areas in central and south-western dooars (North Bengal) as high “human-leopard conflict risk zones”. This analytical procedure can be adopted in other sites to identify potential human-carnivore conflict risk zones."
https://openalex.org/W2895371665,"Background Antenatal period is an opportunity for reaching pregnant women with vital interventions. In fact, antenatal care (ANC) coverage was an indicator for assessing progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. This paper applies a novel index of service coverage using ANC, which accounts for every ANC visit. An index of service coverage gap is also proposed. These indices are additively decomposable by population groups and they are sensitive to the receipt of more ANC visits below a defined threshold. These indices have also been generalised to account for the quality of services. Methods Data from recent rounds of the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) are used to reassess ANC service coverage in 35 sub-Saharan African countries. An index of ANC coverage was estimated. These countries were ranked, and their ranks are compared with those based on attaining at least four ANC visits (ANC4+). Findings The index of ANC coverage reflected the level of service coverage in countries. Further, disparities exist in country ranking as some countries, e.g. Cameroon, Benin Republic and Nigeria are ranked better using the ANC4+ indicator but poorly using the proposed index. Also, Rwanda and Malawi are ranked better using the proposed index. Conclusion The proposed ANC index allows for the assessment of progressive realisation, rooted in the move towards universal health coverage. In fact, the index reflects progress that countries make in increasing service coverage. This is because every ANC visit counts. Beyond ANC coverage, the proposed index is applicable to assessing service coverage generally including quality education."

We measured the wish for cross-sex hormones or gender-affirming surgery, as well as other aspects of gender incongruence, among the general adult population of Stockholm County, Sweden. A population-representative sample of 50,157 Stockholm County residents ages 22 and older comprise the Stockholm Public Health Cohort. They were enrolled in 2002, 2006, and 2010 and followed-up in roughly 4-year intervals, with questions on health, lifestyle and social characteristics. In 2014, participants received the item ""I would like hormones or surgery to be more like someone of a different sex."" Two additional items concerned other aspects of gender incongruence: ""I feel like someone of a different sex"", and ""I would like to live as or be treated as someone of a different sex."" Each item had four answer options (""Not at all correct"", ""Somewhat or occasionally correct"", ""Quite correct"", and ""Absolutely correct""). For each item, any of the three affirmative answer choices were considered as some level of agreement. Calibration weights were used to estimate population-representative rates with 95% confidence intervals. The desire for cross-sex hormones or surgery was reported by 0.5% (95% CI, 0.4%-0.7%) of participants. Feeling like someone of a different sex was reported by 2.3% (95% CI, 2.1%-2.6%). Wanting to live as or be treated as a person of another sex was reported by 2.8% (95% CI, 2.4%-3.1%). These findings greatly exceed estimates of the number of patients receiving gender-affirming medical care. Clinicians must be prepared to recognize and care for patients experiencing discomfort due to gender incongruence and those who would like gender-affirming medical treatment."

Drawing insights from the sustainable consumption and ecological economics literature, this analysis evaluates whether consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable beer and what predicts the value of the premium. Based on a survey of beer consumers from across the U.S. that contained one of two willingness-to-pay exercises, we evaluate what respondent attributes are associated with a higher willingness-to-pay for sustainably brewed beer. We find that the majority of beer consumers are willing to pay more for sustainable beer. Consumers who are prepared to pay a premium tend to already pay more per unit of beer, are more aware of their purchasing behavior and the manner in which their consumption patterns may affect the environment, and pursue lifestyles based on professional advancement, helping the environment, and helping other causes."
https://openalex.org/W2894798854,"Obesity is a major public health problem worldwide. In the United States, one-third of women of reproductive age are obese. Human studies show that maternal obesity (MO) predisposes offspring to cardiovascular disease. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Given the similarities between pregnancy in sheep and humans, we studied sheep to examine the impact of MO on fetal cardiomyocyte contractility at term. We observed that MO impaired cardiomyocyte contractility by reducing peak shortening and shortening/relengthening velocity, prolonging time to relengthening. MO disrupted Ca2+ homeostasis in fetal cardiomyocytes, increasing intracellular Ca2+ and inducing cellular Ca2+ insensitivity. The Ca2+-release channel was impaired, but Ca2+ uptake was unaffected by MO. The upstream kinases that phosphorylate the Ca2+-release channel-ryanodine receptor-2, PKA, and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II-were activated in MO fetuses. Contractile dysfunction was associated with an increased ratio of myosin heavy chain (MHC)-β to MHC-α and upregulated cardiac troponin (cTn)-T and tropomyosin, as well as cTn-I phosphorylation. In summary, this is the first characterization of the effects of MO on fetal cardiomyocyte contractility. Our findings indicate that MO impairs fetal cardiomyocyte contractility through altered intracellular Ca2+ handling, overloading fetal cardiomyocyte intracellular Ca2+ and aberrant myofilament protein composition. These mechanisms may contribute to developmental programming by MO of offspring cardiac function and predisposition to later life cardiovascular disease in the offspring.-Wang, Q., Zhu, C., Sun, M., Maimaiti, R., Ford, S.

https://openalex.org/W2895380184,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a known medical burden in most developed countries and a significant cause of morbidity. The IBD label includes Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Pharmacological and surgical intervention are the two main management approaches for IBD. Some drugs have been developed for IBD therapy, but accessibility is limited due to high costs. Furthermore, these agents have demonstrated inactivity over long-term treatment courses. Therefore, an urgent need is present for new treatment options that are safe, able to sustain clinical remission, and improve mucosal gut healing. Seaweed has received much attention in the pharmacological field owing to its various biomedical properties, including the prolongation of blood clotting time, as well as antitumor, anti-inflammation, and antioxidant effects. This study therefore aimed to examine the effects of a dietary polysaccharide-rich extract obtained from Eucheuma cottonii (EC) on a model of colitis. Colitis was induced in male BALB/c mice by the administration of 2.5% (w/v) dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) for 7 days. DSS-induced mice were treated with either one of three different doses of EC extracts (0.35, 0.70, and 1.75 g/kg body weight) or curcumin as a positive control (0.10 g/kg). Mice were sacrificed post-treatment and blood samples were collected. The disease activity index (DAI) and inflammatory cytokine levels (tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-10) were measured. After treatment for 7 days, EC extract administration protected against weight loss and decreased the colon weight per length ratio. EC extract administration also decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, increased IL-10 levels, and reduced colonic damage. Therefore, a dietary polysaccharide-rich extract from E. cottonii reduced DSS-induced bowel inflammation, thereby becoming a promising candidate for the treatment of colitis."
https://openalex.org/W2894735074,"The West African forest-savanna mosaic, an important habitat for biodiversity and humans, is severely degraded, fragmented and modified by human activities. However, few studies have quantified the land cover changes observed over time and/or analysed the drivers of change. This study focused on Fazao-Malfakassa National Park, the largest in Togo, uses a combination of remote sensing, ground surveys and questionnaires to: (i) quantify vegetation changes, (ii) determine the drivers of change, (iii) compare results with findings elsewhere in the region and (iv) suggest management interventions. The images used were Landsat 5 TM, Landsat 7 ETM and Sentinel-2. Different vegetation indices were computed including: number of fragments, index of dominance, mean area of a vegetation type and mean annual expansion rate. In total, 300 people (including park staff and local populations) were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. Results indicate that between 1987 and 2015 closed-canopy forest and tree-savanna became severely degraded and fragmented, following trends in other parts of the West African forest-savanna mosaic. The main drivers of change were agricultural expansion, bush fires and timber extraction. Observed changes and drivers altered with time: e.g. agricultural expansion was greatest during 1987-2001 (linked with political instability) while illegal timber extraction augmented during 2001-2015 (following increased timber value). Park staff and local populations' perceptions on drivers of change did not differ. Our study highlights that action is urgently needed if we are to preserve this important habitat, the biodiversity it hosts and the services it provides to humans. We suggest several management interventions, learning from successful interventions elsewhere in the region."
https://openalex.org/W2895496631,"Background Climate change has implications for human health and productivity. Models suggest that heat extremes affect worker health, reduce labor capacity, and commodity supply. Chronic health conditions are on the rise internationally. However there is a paucity of direct empirical evidence relating increasing temperatures to both agricultural worker health and productivity. Methods and findings We evaluated the relationship between temperature exposure, kidney function, and two measures of productivity—tons of commodity produced and job attrition, of 4,095 Guatemalan sugarcane cutters over a 6-month harvest. We used distributed lag non-linear models to evaluate associations between wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and productivity of workers with normal or impaired kidney function. The cumulative effect of exposure to a max WBGT of 34°C was 1.16 tons (95% CI: -2.87, 0.54) less sugarcane cut over the next five days by workers with impaired kidney function, compared to exposure to 29°C. Impaired kidney function was associated with premature workforce attrition. Workers starting the harvest season with impaired kidney function were more than twice as likely to leave employment (HR: 2.92, 95% CI: 1.88, 4.32). Conclusions Heat extremes may be associated with loss of agricultural worker productivity and employment, especially among those with impaired kidney function. Agricultural workers who develop health conditions, such as kidney disease, are particularly vulnerable in the face of climate change and increasing heat extremes. The resultant loss of employment and productivity has significant implications for global commodity supplies."

Risk and dose-response following prolonged radiation exposure remain unclear. The present study was aimed to assess skin melanoma (SM) and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) incidence risks in a cohort of workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation at low dose rates over prolonged periods. The study cohort included workers of a Russian nuclear production facility, Mayak Production Association (PA), who were first employed in 1948–1982 and followed up till the end of 2013 (the total of 22,377 individuals with 25% of females). Using AMFIT module of EPICURE software, relative risk and excess relative risk per unit dose (RR and ERR/Sv) were calculated. 60 SM and 294 NMSC cases were registered in members of the study cohort. SM and NMSC incidence was dependent on sex, attained age, age at first employment at the enterprise, type of facility, education level and was not dependent on calendar period of first employment, calendar period of diagnosis, duration of employment, smoking and alcohol consumption statuses. The risk of NMSC incidence was found to be significantly increased in workers occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation at cumulative doses above 2.0 Sv (RR = 2.52; 95% CI: 1.60, 3.97) compared to a reference dose category (0–0.05 Sv). NMSC incidence was found to be significantly associated with cumulative external gamma-dose with ERR/Sv of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.90) without an adjustment for neutron dose and 0.51 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.93) while adjusted for neutron dose. Results of the analysis did not reveal a significant association of SM incidence with cumulative dose from external gamma-rays with ERR/Sv of 0.22 (95% CI: -0.29, 1.46) not including a neutron dose adjustment and of 0.15 (95% CI: -0.41, 1.31) while adjusted for dose from neutron exposure."
https://openalex.org/W2895411238,"Recent studies suggest that similar injury mechanisms are in place across different solid organ transplants, resulting in the identification of a common rejection module (CRM), consisting of 11 genes that are overexpressed during acute and, to a lesser extent, chronic allograft rejection.We wanted to evaluate the usefulness of the CRM module in identifying acute rejection (AR) and different phenotypes of chronic lung transplant rejection (CLAD), i.e., bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) and restrictive allograft syndrome (RAS), using transbronchial brushings, broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) samples, and explant tissue.Gene expression measurements for the 11 CRM genes (CD6, TAP1, CXCL10, CXCL9, INPP5D, ISG20, LCK, NKG7, PSMB9, RUNX3, and BASP1) were performed via qRT-PCR in 14 transbronchial brushings (AR, n = 4; no AR, n = 10), 32 BAL samples (stable, n = 13; AR, n = 8; BOS, n = 9; RAS, n = 10), and 44 tissue specimens (unused donor lungs, n = 15; BOS, n = 13; RAS, n = 16). A geometric mean score was calculated to quantitate overall burden of immune injury and a new computational model was built for the most significant genes in lung transplant injury.Acute rejection showed a significant difference in almost every gene analysed, validating previous observations from microarray analysis. RAS tissue demonstrated a higher geometric mean score (6.35) compared to donor tissue (4.09, p = 0.018). Analysis of individual CRM genes showed an increased expression of ISG20, CXCL10 and CXCL9 in RAS. In BAL samples, no differences were detected in gene expression or geometric mean scores between the various groups (stable, 5.15; AR, 5.81; BOS, 5.62; RAS, 7.31). A newly modelled 2-gene tissue CRM score did not demonstrate any difference between BOS and RAS (p>0.05). However, the model was able to discriminate RAS from BOS tissue (AUC = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.55-0.94, p = 0.025).Transcriptional tissue analysis for CRM genes in CLAD can identify acute rejection and distinguish RAS from BOS. The immune activation in RAS seems similar to acute rejection after kidney/liver/heart transplantation."

We demonstrate the strong influence of age and gender on Instagram use in terms of topical and content differences. We then build age and gender classification models that yield F1 scores of up to 88% and 74% in the detection of age and gender, respectively, and that better characterize users by images than by tags. We further demonstrate the robustness of our models using a new set of test data, with which the models exhibit greater overall performance than human raters.

https://openalex.org/W2894582260,"KCNE5 is an X-linked gene encoding KCNE5, an ancillary subunit to voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels. Human KCNE5 mutations are associated with atrial fibrillation (AF)– and Brugada syndrome (BrS)–induced cardiac arrhythmias that can arise from increased potassium current in cardiomyocytes. Seeking to establish underlying molecular mechanisms, we created and studied Kcne5 knockout (Kcne5−/0) mice. Intracardiac ECG revealed that Kcne5 deletion caused ventricular premature beats, increased susceptibility to induction of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (60 vs. 24% in Kcne5+/0 mice), and 10% shorter ventricular refractory period. Kcne5 deletion increased mean ventricular myocyte Kv current density in the apex and also in the subpopulation of septal myocytes that lack fast transient outward current (Ito,f). The current increases arose from an apex-specific increase in slow transient outward current-1 (IKslow,1) (conducted by Kv1.5) and Ito,f (conducted by KV4) and an increase in IKslow,2 (conducted by Kv2.1) in both apex and septum. Kcne5 protein localized to the intercalated discs in ventricular myocytes, where KV2.1 was also detected in both Kcne5−/0 and Kcne5+/0 mice. In HL-1 cardiac cells and human embryonic kidney cells, KCNE5 and KV2.1 colocalized at the cell surface, but predominantly in intracellular vesicles, suggesting that Kcne5 deletion increases IK,slow2 by reducing KV2.1 intracellular sequestration. The human AF-associated mutation KCNE5-L65F negative shifted the voltage dependence of KV2.1-KCNE5 channels, increasing their maximum current density >2-fold, whereas BrS-associated KCNE5 mutations produced more subtle negative shifts in KV2.1 voltage dependence. The findings represent the first reported native role for Kcne5 and the first demonstrated Kcne regulation of KV2.1 in mouse heart. Increased KV current is a manifestation of KCNE5 disruption that is most likely common to both mouse and human hearts, providing a plausible mechanistic basis for human KCNE5-linked AF and BrS.—David, J.-P., Lisewski, U., Crump, S.

https://openalex.org/W2894983839,"Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is a drought tolerant crop, which is being developed as a bioenergy feedstock. The monolignol biosynthesis pathway is a major focus for altering the abundance and composition of lignin. Caffeoyl coenzyme-A O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT) is an S-adenosyl methionine (SAM)-dependent O-methyltransferase that methylates caffeoyl-CoA to generate feruloyl-CoA, an intermediate required for the biosynthesis of both G- and S-lignin. SbCCoAOMT was overexpressed to assess the impact of increasing the amount of this enzyme on biomass composition. SbCCoAOMT overexpression increased both soluble and cell wall-bound (esterified) ferulic and sinapic acids, however lignin concentration and its composition (S/G ratio) remained unaffected. This increased deposition of hydroxycinnamic acids in these lines led to an increase in total energy content of the stover. In stalk and leaf midribs, the increased histochemical staining and autofluorescence in the cell walls of the SbCCoAOMT overexpression lines also indicate increased phenolic deposition within cell walls, which is consistent with the chemical analyses of soluble and wall-bound hydroxycinnamic acids. The growth and development of overexpression lines were similar to wild-type plants. Likewise, RNA-seq and metabolite profiling showed that global gene expression and metabolite levels in overexpression lines were also relatively similar to wild-type plants. Our results demonstrate that SbCCoAOMT overexpression significantly altered cell wall composition through increases in cell wall associated hydroxycinnamic acids without altering lignin concentration or affecting plant growth and development."

The design was a 10-year retrospective cross-sectional study analysing 629 medical records and computed tomography (CT) data of patients with orbital fractures from January 2008 to January 2017. Demographic, etiology, co-morbidity and clinical characteristics were obtained from the medical records. Assessment of the PE, fracture site and size, intraorbital structures and muscle change were performed using the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) viewer software, OsiriX v5.8.2. Of the 629 patients with orbital fractures, 87 were pure orbital blowout fractures. Demographic pattern showed that males outnumbered females in the series, with male: female ratio of 5.7:1. The mean age was 37.2 ± 14.7 and the main etiology was motor vehicle accident. Orbital floor fracture was the most common fracture location (67.8%). The involvement of the posterior ledge and inferior orbital fissure showed statistical significant difference with PE (Fisher's exact test, p = 0.03). Binary logistic regression showed that after controlling for age, patients with fracture size of more than 150 mm2 had three times the odds of sustaining a PE, (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.01 (95% CI 1.17-7.92). Fracture size larger than 150 mm2 was a radiological predictor of PE. Additional research investigating further on the role of concurrent fracture of the posterior ledge and inferior orbital fissure is advocated."
https://openalex.org/W2895666882,"Members of the G protein–coupled receptor and TMEM16 (transmembrane protein 16) protein families are phospholipid scramblases that facilitate rapid, bidirectional movement of phospholipids across a membrane bilayer in an ATP-independent manner. On reconstitution into large unilamellar vesicles, these proteins scramble more than 10,000 lipids/protein/s as measured with co-reconstituted fluorescent nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-labeled phospholipids. Although NBD-labeled phospholipids are ubiquitously used as reporters of scramblase activity, it remains unclear whether the NBD modification influences the quantitative outcomes of the scramblase assay. We now report a refined biochemical approach for measuring the activity of scramblase proteins with radiolabeled natural phosphatidylinositol ([3H]PI) and exploiting the hydrolytic activity of bacterial PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) to detect the transbilayer movement of PI. PI-PLC rapidly hydrolyzed 50% of [3H]PI in large symmetric, unilamellar liposomes, corresponding to the lipid pool in the outer leaflet. On reconstitution of a crude preparation of yeast endoplasmic reticulum scramblase, purified bovine opsin, or purified Nectria haematococca TMEM16, the extent of [3H]PI hydrolysis increased, indicating that [3H]PI from the inner leaflet had been scrambled to the outer leaflet. Using transphosphatidylation, we synthesized acyl-NBD-PI and used it to compare our PI-PLC–based assay with conventional fluorescence-based methods. Our results revealed quantitative differences between the two assays that we attribute to the specific features of the assays themselves rather than to the nature of the phospholipid. In summary, we have developed an assay that measures scrambling of a chemically unmodified phospholipid by a reconstituted scramblase. Members of the G protein–coupled receptor and TMEM16 (transmembrane protein 16) protein families are phospholipid scramblases that facilitate rapid, bidirectional movement of phospholipids across a membrane bilayer in an ATP-independent manner. On reconstitution into large unilamellar vesicles, these proteins scramble more than 10,000 lipids/protein/s as measured with co-reconstituted fluorescent nitrobenzoxadiazole (NBD)-labeled phospholipids. Although NBD-labeled phospholipids are ubiquitously used as reporters of scramblase activity, it remains unclear whether the NBD modification influences the quantitative outcomes of the scramblase assay. We now report a refined biochemical approach for measuring the activity of scramblase proteins with radiolabeled natural phosphatidylinositol ([3H]PI) and exploiting the hydrolytic activity of bacterial PI-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) to detect the transbilayer movement of PI. PI-PLC rapidly hydrolyzed 50% of [3H]PI in large symmetric, unilamellar liposomes, corresponding to the lipid pool in the outer leaflet.

https://openalex.org/W2895137198,"Based on a survey, the following study investigates opinions and also usage patterns relating to the ResearchGate social networking site for scientists and researchers. The survey consisted of 19 questions and was conducted online with 695 scientists from the disciplines of physics, biology, medicine, and neuroscience. Amongst other issues, the research questions concerned how much time and effort the interviewees expended on ResearchGate, what added value they perceived in using the site, the extent to which social aspects influence use, how participants planned to use the platform in future, and what role ResearchGate’s own metric, the RG score, played for the scientists. In addition, we discuss which of the factors of age, sex, origin, and scientific discipline have a decisive influence on the responses of the interviewees and which are of no statistical significance The results clearly show that the origin of the participants is frequently decisive, but that the remaining factors also have a considerable influence on the responses for more than 25% of the questions."
https://openalex.org/W2895562867,"This study aimed to compare the components of force-velocity (F-V) and power-velocity (P-V) profiles and the mechanical effectiveness of force application (or force ratio–RF) among various sled-towing loads during the entire acceleration phase of a weighted sled sprint. Eighteen sprinters performed four 50-m sprints in various conditions: unloaded; with a load corresponding to 20% of the athlete’s body mass (BM); with a load of 30% BM; and with a load of 40% BM. Data were collected with five video cameras, and the images were digitised to obtain velocity from the derivation of the centre-of-mass position. F-V and P-V components and RF were estimated from sprinting velocity-time data for each load using a validated method that is based on an inverse dynamic approach applied to the sprinter’s centre-of-mass (it models the horizontal antero-posterior and vertical ground reaction force components) and requires only measurement of anthropometric and spatiotemporal variables (body mass, stature and instantaneous position or velocity during the acceleration phase). The theoretical maximal velocity decreased with load compared with the unloaded condition (for 20% BM: -6%, effect size (ES) = 0,38; for 30% BM: -15%, ES = 1.02; for 40% BM: -18%, ES = 1.10). The theoretical maximal horizontal force (F0) and maximal power were not different among conditions. However, power at the end of the acceleration phase increased with load (40% BM vs 0%: 72%; ES = 2.73) as well as the maximal mechanical effectiveness (12%; ES = 0.85). The linear decrease in RF was different between 30 or 40% BM and the unloaded condition (-23%; ES = 0.74 and 0.66). Better effectiveness may be developed with 40% BM load at the beginning of the acceleration and with the various load-induced changes in the components of the F-V and P-V relationships, allowing a more accurate determination of optimal loading conditions for maximizing power."
https://openalex.org/W2894972299,"Background Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) who get and keep a suppressed viral load are unlikely to transmit HIV. Simple, practical interventions to help achieve HIV viral suppression that are easy and inexpensive to administer in clinical settings are needed. We evaluated whether a brief video containing HIV-related health messages targeted to all patients in the waiting room improved treatment initiation, medication adherence, and retention in care. Methods and findings In a quasi-experimental trial all patients (N = 2,023) attending two HIV clinics from June 2016 to March 2017 were exposed to a theory-based, 29-minute video depicting persons overcoming barriers to starting treatment, taking medication as prescribed, and keeping medical appointments. New prescriptions at index visit, HIV viral load test results, and dates of return visits were collected through review of medical records for all patients during the 10 months that the video was shown. Those data were compared with the same variables collected for all patients (N = 1,979) visiting the clinics during the prior 10 months (August 2015 to May 2016). Among patients exposed to the video, there was an overall 10.4 percentage point increase in patients prescribed treatment (60.3% to 70.7%, p< 0.01). Additionally, there was an overall 6.0 percentage point improvement in viral suppression (56.7% to 62.7%, p< 0.01), however mixed results between sites was observed. There was not a significant change in rates of return visits (77.5% to 78.8%). A study limitation is that, due to the lack of randomization, the findings may be subject to bias and secular trends. Conclusions Showing a brief treatment-focused video in HIV clinic waiting rooms can be effective at improving treatment initiation and may help patients achieve viral suppression. This feasible, low resource-reliant video intervention may be appropriate for adoption by other clinics treating persons with HIV. Trial registration http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03508310)."

Multiple AGs promoted mexAB-oprM expression and this was lost in the absence of the amgRS locus encoding an aminoglycoside-activated envelope stress-responsive 2-component system (TCS). Purified AmgR bound to the mexAB-oprM promoter region consistent with this response regulator directly regulating expression of the efflux operon. The thiol-active reagent, diamide, which, like AGs, promotes protein aggregation and cytoplasmic membrane damage also promoted AmgRS-dependent mexAB-oprM expression, a clear indication that the MexAB-OprM efflux system is recruited in response to membrane perturbation and/or circumstances that lead to this. Despite the AG and diamide induction of mexAB-oprM, however, MexAB-OprM does not appear to contribute to resistance to these agents."

It is the first new African genus of Podostemaceae published for 30 years. First collected in May 2017, the species is assessed as Critically Endangered using the IUCN 2012 standard. It is on the edge of extinction with a small population at a single site threatened by deposition of gravel and sand from alluvial gold and diamond mining upstream, and a planned hydro-electric dam. The new genus is unique in Podostemaceae in a) its highly developed and robust style-stigma structure in which the bases of the two style-stigmas unite to form a bifurcate funneliform-cylindrical structure, with a reflexed, blade-like apex that extends half-way around the perimeter of the ovary-fruit towards the base of the ovary-fruit, b) a specialised andropodium, with robust, self-supporting capacity, having differentiated thickened central, and angled, thinner marginal areas (in other Podostemaceae the andropodial structures are undifferentiated), c) the pillar-like haptera which completely elevate the crustose root above the substrate. Lebbiea is placed in Podostemoideae, necessitating amplification of the delimitation of that subfamily in which it is additionally unique in having the foliose tepals characteristic of the basal subfamilies Weddellinoideae and Tristichoideae."
https://openalex.org/W2895081681,"Background Further improvements in population health in low- and middle-income countries demand high-quality care to address an increasingly complex burden of disease. Health facility surveys provide an important but costly source of information on readiness to provide care. To improve the efficiency of health system measurement, we applied unsupervised machine learning methods to assess the performance of the service readiness index (SRI) defined by the World Health Organization and compared it to empirically derived indices. Methods We drew data from nationally representative Service Provision Assessment surveys conducted in 10 countries between 2007 and 2015. We extracted 649 items in domains such as infrastructure, medication, and management to calculate an index using all available information and classified facilities into quintiles. We compared three approaches against the full item set: the SRI, a new index based on sequential backward selection, and an enriched SRI that added empirically selected items to the SRI. We evaluated index performance with a cross-validated kappa statistic comparing classification using the candidate index against the 649-item index. Results 9238 facilities were assessed. The 49-item SRI performed poorly against the index using all 649 items, with a kappa value of 0.35. New empirically derived indices with 50 and 100 items captured much more information, with cross-validated kappa statistics of 0.71 and 0.80, respectively. Items varied across the indices and in sensitivity analyses. A 100-item enriched SRI reliably captured the information from the full index: 83% of the facilities were classified into correct quintiles of service readiness based on the full index. Conclusion A facility readiness measure developed by global health experts performed poorly in capturing the totality of readiness information collected during facility surveys. Using a machine learning approach with sequential selection and cross-validation to identify the most informative items dramatically improved performance. Such approaches can make assessment of health facility readiness more efficient. Further improvements in measurement will require identification of external criteria—such as patient outcomes—to guide and validate measure development."
https://openalex.org/W2895339159,"Ion-coupled transporters must regulate access of ions and substrates into and out of the binding site to actively transport substrates and minimize dissipative leak of ions. Within the single-site alternating access model, competitive substrate binding forms the foundation of ion-coupled antiport. Strict competition between substrates leads to stoichiometric antiport without slippage. However, recent NMR studies of the bacterial multidrug transporter EmrE have demonstrated that this multidrug transporter can simultaneously bind drug and proton, which will affect the transport stoichiometry and efficiency of coupled antiport. Here, we investigated the nature of substrate competition in EmrE using multiple methods to measure proton release upon the addition of saturating concentrations of drug as a function of pH. The resulting proton-release profile confirmed simultaneous binding of drug and proton, but suggested that a residue outside EmrE's Glu-14 binding site may release protons upon drug binding. Using NMR-monitored pH titrations, we trace this drug-induced deprotonation event to His-110, EmrE's C-terminal residue. Further NMR experiments disclosed that the C-terminal tail is strongly coupled to EmrE's drug-binding domain. Consideration of our results alongside those from previous studies of EmrE suggests that this conserved tail participates in secondary gating of EmrE-mediated proton/drug transport, occluding the binding pocket of fully protonated EmrE in the absence of drug to prevent dissipative proton transport."
https://openalex.org/W2895631785,"The Hijab and other forms of Islamic veiling are important social, cultural, and religious symbols that are central to the identity of millions of Muslim women across the world. However, despite the large body of literature that exists on the political and socio-cultural aspects of Islamic veiling, little is known about how the appearance of women wearing the hijab is perceived by other Muslim women within their native Muslim country. To throw light on this important issue, the current study focussed on the effects of the hijab on female facial attractiveness perceived by practising Muslim Emirati women living in their native Muslim country (the United Arab Emirates) who themselves wore the hijab as everyday attire. Participants were shown frontal-head images of women in three different conditions: covered (heads fully covered by the hijab except for the face), partially covered (heads fully covered by the hijab except for the face and the hair around the forehead) and uncovered (heads with no covering). The findings showed that faces in images where heads were covered and partially covered by the hijab were rated as equally attractive but both were rated as significantly less attractive than faces in images where heads were uncovered. These findings suggest that, even for practising Muslim Emirati females living in their native Muslim country for whom wearing the hijab is a normal aspect of everyday life, perception of facial attractiveness is compromised by wearing this garment. We argue that this effect of wearing the hijab is not consistent with a preference for one's own cultural group (cultural endogamy) and may, instead, occur because wearing a hijab occludes external features, such as hair and ears, which normally contribute to the perception of human facial attractiveness. In sum, while wearing the hijab may be dominated by male attitudes towards suppressing female attractiveness towards males, the findings from this study suggest that female Muslims too perceive the negative influence of wearing the hijab on female facial attractiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2895554812,"The ever-increasing human-mediated wildlife reshuffling is raising concern for the conservation of biodiversity. The loss of biological distinctiveness among regions lessens the genetic diversity and consequently the evolutionary potential of local biotas to tackle present-day global change and human disturbance. This process may be sometimes cryptic unless investigated by means of a molecular approach. In this respect, game birds are a paradigmatic case. The black francolin (Francolinus francolinus, Phasianidae) is a medium-sized galliform whose distribution range stretches from Cyprus to the Gulf of Bengal. Six morphologic subspecies are known, with three of which occurring in Pakistan, where the species is heavily hunted and used as pet for chirping competitions. We genotyped 98 samples (feathers) at both the entire mitochondrial DNA Control Region gene and nine microsatellite loci to get a deeper insight into the genetic diversity of the black francolin in Pakistan in order to offer cogent recommendations for its conservation management. We identified several mtDNA lineages that were consistent with the currently described subspecies/taxonomy whose pattern of co-occurrence is compatible with the geological history and the faunal movement routes of the region under study. However, the biparentally inherited microsatellites returned a quite discordant picture of an extensive, sex-biased genetic mixing due to the intensive relocations of already overharvested male individuals for chirping competitions. Our results indicated that the genetic integrity of the black francolin in Pakistan could be seriously at risk and call for monitoring and limiting its trade other than enhancing the public awareness of the importance of local biodiversity resources."
https://openalex.org/W2895003657,"The development of ice-phobic, glass-substrate surfaces is important for many reasons such as poor visibility through the ice-covered windshields of vehicles. The present authors have developed new glass surfaces coated with a silane coupling agent and polypeptides whose amino-acid sequence is identical to a partial sequence of winter flounder antifreeze protein. We have conducted experiments on the freezing of sessile water droplets on the glass surfaces, and measured the droplet temperature, contact angle, contact area and surface roughness. The results show that the supercooling temperature decreased noticeably in the case where a higher concentration solution of polypeptide was used for the coating. The adhesion strength of frozen droplets was lowest in the same case. In addition, we observed many nanoscale humps on the coated surface, which were formed by polypeptide aggregates in the solution. We argue that the combination of the hydrophilic humps and the hydrophobic base surfaces causes water molecules adjacent to the surfaces to have a variety of orientations in that plane, even after the ice layer started to grow. This then induces a misfit of water-molecule spacing in the ice layers and consequent formation of fragile polycrystalline structure. This explains the lower values of ice adhesion strength and supercooling enhancement in the cases of the polypeptide-coated glass plates."
https://openalex.org/W2895410571,"With a majority of ‘Yes’ votes in the Constitutional Referendum of 2017, Turkey continued its drift towards an autocracy. By the will of the Turkish people, this referendum transferred practically all executive power to president Erdoğan. However, the referendum was confronted with a substantial number of allegations of electoral misconducts and irregularities, ranging from state coercion of ‘No’ supporters to the controversial validity of unstamped ballots. Here we report the results of an election forensic analysis of recent Turkish elections to clarify to what extent it is plausible that these voting irregularities were present and able to influence the outcome of the referendum. We apply statistical forensics tests to identify the specific nature of the alleged electoral malpractices. In particular, we test whether the data contains fingerprints for ballot stuffing (submission of multiple ballots per person during the vote) and voter rigging (coercion and intimidation of voters). Additionally, we perform tests to identify numerical anomalies in the election results. For the 2017 Constitutional Referendum we find systematic and highly significant statistical support for the presence of both ballot stuffing and voter rigging. In 11% of stations we find signs for ballot stuffing with a standard deviation (uncertainty of ballot stuffing probability) of 2.7% (4 sigma event). Removing such ballot-stuffing-characteristic anomalies from the data would tip the overall balance from ‘No’ to a majority of ‘Yes’ votes. The 2017 election was followed by early elections in 2018 to directly vote for a new president who would now be head of state and government. We find statistical irregularities in the 2018 presidential and parliamentary elections similar in size and direction to those in 2017. These findings validate that our results unveil systematic and potentially even fraudulent biases that require further attention in order to combat electoral malpractices."
https://openalex.org/W2895414065,"The objective of this study was to evaluate current approaches to economic modeling in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and propose a new conceptual model for evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of RA interventions. We followed recommendations from the International Society of Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research-Society of Medical Decision Making (ISPOR-SMDM) Modeling Good Research Practices Task Force-2. The process involved scoping the decision problem by a working group and drafting a preliminary cost-effectiveness model framework. A systematic literature review (SLR) of existing decision-analytic models was performed and analysis of an RA registry was conducted to inform the structure of the draft conceptual model. Finally, an expert panel was convened to seek input on the draft conceptual model. The proposed conceptual model consists of three separate modules: 1) patient characteristic module, 2) treatment module, and 3) outcome module. Consistent with the scope, the conceptual model proposed six changes to current economic models in RA. These changes proposed are to: 1) use composite measures of disease activity to evaluate treatment response as well as disease progression (at least two measures should be considered, one as the base case and one as a sensitivity analysis); 2) conduct utility mapping based on disease activity measures; 3) incorporate subgroups based on guideline-recommended prognostic factors; 4) integrate realistic treatment patterns based on clinical practice/registry datasets; 5) assimilate outcomes that are not joint related (extra-articular outcomes); and 6) assess mortality based on disease activity. We proposed a conceptual model that incorporates the current understanding of clinical and real-world evidence in RA, as well as of existing modeling assumptions. The proposed model framework was reviewed with experts and could serve as a foundation for developing future cost-effectiveness models in RA."

The aim of our study is to present an approach that combines prospective scenarios with habitat-based perspective to assess the supply capacity of ecosystem services, plus determine the impact of protected areas in an urbanized tropical estuary. The current situation and two scenarios were generated to evaluate the capacity of habitats to supply ecosystem services. This type of assessment will allow the decision makers to visualize the effect of their choices or the occurrence of events which might produce significant changes in the estuary. Thus, over time, measures can be taken to sustain the supply of ecosystem services. We determined that the establishment of protected areas have a positive impact; however, the effect is not the same for all of them. Consequently, indicating that actions such as community participation, research, education, management planning and infrastructure development must accompany the development of a protected area."
https://openalex.org/W2894841765,"Ratings are present in many areas of assessment including peer review of research proposals and journal articles, teacher observations, university admissions and selection of new hires. One feature present in any rating process with multiple raters is that different raters often assign different scores to the same assessee, with the potential for bias and inconsistencies related to rater or assessee covariates. This paper analyzes disparities in ratings of internal and external applicants to teaching positions using applicant data from Spokane Public Schools. We first test for biases in rating while accounting for measures of teacher applicant qualifications and quality. Then, we develop model-based inter-rater reliability (IRR) estimates that allow us to account for various sources of measurement error, the hierarchical structure of the data, and to test whether covariates, such as applicant status, moderate IRR. We find that applicants external to the district receive lower ratings for job applications compared to internal applicants. This gap in ratings remains significant even after including measures of qualifications and quality such as experience, state licensure scores, or estimated teacher value added. With model-based IRR, we further show that consistency between raters is significantly lower when rating external applicants. We conclude the paper by discussing policy implications and possible applications of our model-based IRR estimate for hiring and selection practices in and out of the teacher labor market."
https://openalex.org/W2949266169,"In Chesapeake Bay, the soft-shell clam Mya arenaria (thin-shelled, deep-burrowing) exhibits population declines when predators are active, and it persists at low densities. In contrast, the hard clam Mercenaria mercenaria (thick-shelled, shallow-burrowing) has a stable population and age distribution. We examined the potential for habitat and predators to control densities and distributions of bivalves in a field caging experiment (Mya only) and laboratory mesocosm experiments (both species). In the field, clams exposed to predators experienced 76.3% greater mortality as compared to caged individuals, and blue crabs were likely responsible for most of the mortality of juvenile Mya. In mesocosm experiments, Mya had lower survival in sand and seagrass than in shell hash or oyster shell habitats. However, crabs often missed one or more prey items in seagrass, shell, and oyster shell habitats. Predator search times and encounter rates declined when prey were at low densities, likely due to the added cost of inefficient foraging; however, this effect was more pronounced for Mya than for Mercenaria. Mercenaria had higher survival than Mya in mesocosm experiments, likely because predators feeding on Mercenaria spent less time foraging than those feeding on Mya. Mya may retain a low-density refuge from predation even with the loss of structurally complex habitats, though a loss of habitat refuge may result in clam densities that are not sustainable. A better understanding of density-dependent predator-prey interactions is necessary to prevent loss of food-web integrity and to conserve marine resources."

Although most PML-RARA mutations were point mutations, we identified a novel seven amino acid deletion mutation (p.K227_T233del) in the RARA region of PML-RARA in a refractory APL patient. Here, we analyzed the evolution of the mutated clone and demonstrated the resistance of the mutated clone to retinoic acid (RA). Mutation analysis of PML-RARA was performed using samples from a chemotherapy- and ATRA-resistant APL patient, and the frequencies of mutated PML-RARA transcript were analyzed by targeted deep sequencing. To clarify the biological significance of the identified PML-RARA mutations, we analyzed the ATRA-induced differentiation and PML nuclear body formation in mutant PML-RARA-transduced HL-60 cells. At molecular relapse, the p.K227_T233del deletion and the p.R217S point-mutation in the RARA region of PML-RARA were identified, and their frequencies increased after re-induction therapy with another type of retinoiec acid (RA), tamibarotene. In deletion PML-RARA-transduced cells, the CD11b expression levels and NBT reducing ability were significantly decreased compared with control cells and the formation of PML nuclear bodies was rarely observed after RA treatment.

https://openalex.org/W2894782814,"Surgical interventions on blood vessels bear a risk for intimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis as a consequence of injury. A specific feature of intimal hyperplasia is the loss of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation gene expression. We hypothesized that immediate responses following injury induce vascular remodeling. To differentiate injury due to trauma, reperfusion and pressure changes we analyzed vascular responses to carotid artery bypass grafting in mice compared to transient ligation. As a control, the carotid artery was surgically laid open only. In both, bypass or ligation models, the inflammatory responses were transient, peaking after 6h, whereas the loss of VSMC differentiation gene expression persisted. Extended time kinetics showed that transient carotid artery ligation was sufficient to induce a persistent VSMC phenotype change throughout 28 days. Transient arterial ligation in ApoE knockout mice resulted in atherosclerosis in the transiently ligated vascular segment but not on the not-ligated contralateral side. The VSMC phenotype change could not be prevented by anti-TNF antibodies, Sorafenib, Cytosporone B or N-acetylcysteine treatment. Surgical interventions involving hypoxia/reperfusion are sufficient to induce VSMC phenotype changes and vascular remodeling. In situations of a perturbed lipid metabolism this bears the risk to precipitate atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W2895601175,"Background Post-myocardial infarction (MI) remodeling contributes to increased electrophysiological and structural heterogeneity and arrhythmogenesis. Utilising the post-infarct ovine model our aim was to determine unipolar electrogram frequency characteristics consequent to this remodeling and the development of Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). Methods and results Mapping studies were performed on 14 sheep at >1 month post-MI induction. Sheep were divided into VT inducible (n = 7) and non-inducible (n = 7) groups. Multielectrode needles (n = 20) were deployed within and surrounding ventricular scar for electrophysiological assessment of electrogram amplitude and width. Spectral analysis of electrograms was undertaken using wavelet and fast fourier transformations (WFFT) to calculate root mean square (RMS) power intervals spanning 0-300Hz in 20Hz intervals. Quantitative assessment between electrophysiological and histological parameters including collagen density, and structural organization of the myocardium was performed. Increasing myocardial scar density resulted in attenuation of electrogram amplitude and RMS values. (all p<0.01). Between groups there were no differences in electrogram amplitude (p = 0.37), however WFFT analysis revealed significantly higher RMS values in the VT group (p<0.05) in association with high frequency fractional components of the electrogram. As scar density increased, greater between-group differences in RMS were observed spanning this high frequency (200-280Hz) spectrum and which were proportionally dependent on the degree of structural disorganisation of the myocardium (p<0.001) and number of extrastimuli required to induce VT (p<0.05). Conclusion High frequency unipolar electrogram spectral characteristics were quantitatively co-influenced by the presence of fibrosis and degree of myocardial structural dissorganisation and were associated with the propensity for development of VT."
https://openalex.org/W2895282329,"Research in photobiology is currently limited by a lack of devices capable of delivering precise and tunable irradiation to cells in a high-throughput format. This limits researchers to using expensive commercially available or custom-built light sources which make it difficult to replicate, standardize, optimize, and scale experiments. Here we present an open-source Microplate Photoirradiation System (MPS) developed to enable high-throughput light experiments in standard 96 and 24-well microplates for a variety of applications in photobiology research. This open-source system features 96 independently controlled LEDs (4 LEDs per well in 24-well), Wi-Fi connected control and programmable graphical user interface (GUI) for control and programming, automated calibration GUI, and modular control and LED boards for maximum flexibility. A web-based GUI generates light program files containing irradiation parameters for groups of LEDs. These parameters are then uploaded wirelessly, stored and used on the MPS to run photoirradiation experiments inside any incubator. A rapid and semi-quantitative porphyrin metabolism assay was also developed to validate the system in wild-type fibroblasts. Protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) fluorescence accumulation was induced by incubation with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a photosensitization method leveraged clinically to destroy malignant cell types in a process termed photodynamic therapy (PDT), and cells were irradiated with 405nm light with varying irradiance, duration and pulsation parameters. Immediately after light treatment with the MPS, subsequent photobleaching was measured in live, adherent cells in both 96-well and a 24-well microplates using a microplate reader. Results demonstrate the utility and reliability of the Microplate Photoirradiation System to irradiate cells with precise irradiance and timing parameters in order to measure PpIx photobleaching kinetics in live adherent cells and perform comparable experiments with both 24 and 96 well microplate formats. The high-throughput capability of the MPS enabled measurement of enough irradiance conditions in a single microplate to fit PpIX fluorescence to a bioexponential decay model of photobleaching, as well as reveal a dependency of photobleaching on duty-cycle—but not frequency—in a pulsed irradiance regimen."
https://openalex.org/W2895299908,"The nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway safeguards the integrity of the transcriptome by targeting mRNAs with premature translation termination codons (PTCs) for degradation. It also regulates gene expression by degrading a large number of non-mutant RNAs (including mRNAs and noncoding RNAs) that bear NMD-inducing features. Consequently, NMD has been shown to influence development, cellular response to stress, and clinical outcome of many genetic diseases. Small molecules that can modulate NMD activity provide critical tools for understanding the mechanism and physiological functions of NMD, and they also offer potential means for treating certain genetic diseases and cancer. Therefore, there is an intense interest in identifying small-molecule NMD inhibitors or enhancers. It was previously reported that both inhibition of NMD and treatment with the AMPK-selective inhibitor Compound C (CC) induce autophagy in human cells, raising the possibility that CC may be capable of inhibiting NMD. Here we show that CC indeed has a NMD-inhibitory activity. Inhibition of NMD by CC is, however, independent of AMPK activity. As a competitive ATP analog, CC does not affect the kinase activity of SMG1, an essential NMD factor and the only known kinase in the NMD pathway. However, CC treatment down-regulates the protein levels of several NMD factors. The induction of autophagy by CC treatment is independent of ATF4, a NMD target that has been shown to promote autophagy in response to NMD inhibition. Our results reveal a new activity of CC as a NMD inhibitor, which has implications for its use in basic research and drug development."

In this study, we investigate sex differences in the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TLR1 and Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) genes and leprosy susceptibility in 256 clinically classified leprosy patients and 233 control subjects in a Brazilian population.

However, the heterozygous genotype of the TLR1 SNP (rs4833095) showed a statistically significant association in women (OR = 0.54, P = 0.02). Our findings suggest that the TLR1 polymorphism was associated with an increased protection from leprosy in women."
https://openalex.org/W2894559402,"In aquatic systems, food web linkages are often assessed using diet contents, stable isotope ratios, and, increasingly, fatty acid composition of organisms. Some correlations between different trophic metrics are assumed to be well-supported; for example, particular stable isotope ratios and fatty acids seem to reflect reliance on benthic or pelagic energy pathways. However, understanding whether the assumed correlations between different trophic metrics are coherent and consistent across species represents a key step toward their effective use in food web studies. To assess links among trophic markers, we compared relationships between major diet components, fatty acids, and stable isotope ratios in three fishes: yellow perch (Perca flavescens), round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), and spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) collected from nearshore Lake Michigan. Yellow perch and spottail shiner are native in this system, while round goby are a relatively recent invader. We found some evidence for agreement between different trophic metrics, especially between diet components, n-3:n-6 fatty acid ratios, and stable isotope ratios (δ13C and δ15N). However, we also observed significant variation in observed relationships among markers and species, potentially due to taxonomic variation in the specific diet items consumed (e.g., chydorid microcrustaceans and Dreissena mussels) and species-specific biochemical processes. In many of these latter cases, the invasive species differed from the native species. Understanding the effects of taxonomic variation on prey and predator signatures could significantly improve the usefulness of fatty acids in food web studies, whereas diet contents and stable isotopes appear to be reliable indicators of trophic niche in aquatic food webs."
https://openalex.org/W2895736895,"Ascitic fluid infection is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients, requiring early diagnosis and therapy. We aimed to determine predictors of ascitic fluid infection in children with chronic liver disease. The study included 45 children with chronic liver disease and ascites who underwent 66 paracentesis procedures. Full history taking and clinical examination of all patients were obtained including fever, abdominal pain and tenderness and respiratory distress. Investigations included: complete blood count, C-reactive protein, full liver function tests, ascitic fluid biochemical analysis, cell count and culture. Our results showed that patients' ages ranged between 3 months to 12 years. Prevalence of ascitic fluid infection was 33.3%. Gram-positive bacteria were identified in six cases, and Gram-negative bacteria in five. Fever and abdominal pain were significantly more associated with infected ascites (p value = 0.004, 0.006). Patients with ascitic fluid infection had statistically significant elevated absolute neutrophilic count and C-reactive protein. Logistic regression analysis showed that fever, abdominal pain, elevated absolute neutrophilic count and positive C-reactive protein are independent predictors of ascitic fluid infection. Fever, elevated absolute neutrophilic count and positive C-reactive protein raise the probability of ascitic fluid infection by 3.88, 9.15 and 4.48 times respectively. The cut-off value for C-reactive protein for ascitic fluid infection was 7.2 with sensitivity 73% and specificity of 71%. In conclusion, prevalence of ascitic fluid infection in pediatric patients with chronic liver disease and ascites was 33.3%. Fever, abdominal pain, positive C-reactive protein and elevated absolute neutrophilic count are strong predictors of ascitic fluid infection. Therefore an empirical course of first-line antibiotics should be immediately started with presence of any of these predictors after performing ascitic fluid tapping for culture and sensitivity. In absence of these infection parameters, routine ascitic fluid analysis could be spared."
https://openalex.org/W2894798393,"To evaluate obstetric healthcare provider knowledge regarding the prevention of group B streptococcal disease in South African infants.Questionnaires exploring knowledge, attitudes and beliefs around group B streptococcal prevention were administered to consenting doctors and maternity nurses in a tertiary academic hospital. Qualitative assessments (focus groups) were undertaken with junior doctors and nurses.238 participants completed the questionnaire: 150 (63.0%) doctors and 88 (37.0%) nurses. Overall, 22.7% of participants correctly identified the risk-based prevention protocol recommended at this hospital. Most doctors (68.0%) and nurses (94.3%) could not correctly list a single risk factor. A third of doctors did not know the correct antibiotic protocols, and most (80.0%) did not know the recommended timing of antibiotics in relation to delivery. Focus group discussions highlighted the lack of knowledge, awareness and effective implementation of protocols regarding disease prevention.Our study highlighted knowledge gaps on the risk-based prevention strategy in a setting which has consistently reported among the highest incidence of invasive group B streptococcal disease globally. In these settings, education and prioritization of the risk-based intrapartum antibiotic strategy is warranted, but an alternative vaccine-based strategy may prove more effective in preventing invasive group B streptococcal disease in the long-term."
https://openalex.org/W2894995085,"Green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters controlled by the regulatory region of OCT4 and NANOG-two master regulators for pluripotency are widely used in studies of pluripotent stem cell establishment and embryo development. Alongside the challenge in establishing bovine pluripotent stem cells, the application of bovine-specific gene reporters has rarely been explored. Using lentivirus-based GFP reporter, we investigated the upstream regulatory regions of bovine OCT4 and NANOG. These reporters show activity in both naïve- and primed-state pluripotency when infected into mouse and human embryonic stem cells (ESCs), respectively. Consistent with what is found in humans and mice, the bovine OCT4-distal enhancer (bOCT4-DE) but not the proximal enhancer (bOCT4-PE) region is preferentially activated in naïve-state pluripotency. Furthermore, the bOCT4-DE region is silenced upon conversion of naive-state ESCs into primed-state epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). Co-infection of mouse fibroblasts with the reprograming factors for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) induction leads to the generation of GFP positive colonies, demonstrating that these GFP reporters can serve as live indicators for induced pluripotent cell establishment. We further proved that the bovine OCT4 distal enhancer is active in bovine blastocysts. We established the lentiviral-based fluorescent reporters controlled by bovine OCT4 and NANOG enhancer sequences. These reporter constructs show activity in naïve- and primed-pluripotent states. These reporters may serve as versatile tools for bovine ESC/iPSC generation and identification, as well as for developmental studies of bovine embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2895519667,"Topical application of Vitamin K1 has been demonstrated to effectively treat papulopustular skin rash, a serious and frequently encountered side effect of Epidermal Growth Factor Inhibitors (EGFRIs). Systemic absorption of vitamin K1 from skin and the resultant consequence of antagonizing EGFRIs anticancer effects jeopardizes the clinical acceptability of this rather effective treatment. The purpose of the present study was to rationally formulate and evaluate the release rate and transdermal absorption of a wide range of Vitamin K1 dermal preparations with a variety of physiochemical properties. A library of 33 formulations with were compounded and tested for Vitamin K1 permeation using hydrophobic membranes and porcine skin mounted in a Fran diffusion cells. Our results demonstrate the lowest diffusion for water-in-oil emulsions, which also demonstrated a negligible transdermal absorption. The statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between in vitro and ex vivo results. While viscosity did not have a significant impact on the diffusion or absorption of vitamin K1, an increase in the lipid content was correlated with an increase in transmembrane diffusion (not with transdermal absorption). Overall, formulation design significantly impacts the release rate and transdermal absorption of vitamin K1, and confirms the possibility of minimal systemic distribution of this vitamin for this specific purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2894605928,"Birdsong is a complex learned behavior regulated by Neuromuscular coordination of different muscle sets necessary for producing relevant sounds. We developed a heterogeneous and stochastically connected neural network representing the pathway from the high vocal center (HVC) to the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) neurons that drive the muscles to generate sounds. We show that a single active neuron is sufficient to initiate a chain of spiking events that results to excite the entire network system. The network could synthesize realistic bird sounds spectra, with spontaneous generation of intermittent sound bursts typical of birdsong (song syllables). This study confirms experiments on animals and on humans, where results have shown that single neurons are responsible for the activation of complex behavior or are associated with high-level perception events."
https://openalex.org/W2895236855,"Recently, Lu et al. claimed that Xie et al.'s three-party password-authenticated key agreement protocol (3PAKA) using chaotic maps has three security vulnerabilities; in particular, it cannot resist offline password guessing attack, Bergamo et al.'s attack and impersonation attack, and then they proposed an improved protocol. However, we demonstrate that Lu et al.'s attacks on Xie et al.'s scheme are unworkable, and their improved protocol is insecure against stolen-verifier attack and off-line password guessing attack. Furthermore, we propose a novel scheme with enhanced security and efficiency. We use formal verification tool ProVerif, which is based on pi calculus, to prove security and authentication of our scheme. The efficiency of the proposed scheme is higher than other related schemes."
https://openalex.org/W2895035807,"We investigate various group-size distributions occurring in a situation where each group's resource is exposed to appropriation by other groups. The amount of appropriation depends on the size difference between groups. Our work focuses on the cases where the entire community isolates a small group or even an individual to maximize its gain. While people's basic motivation to form a group can be understood based on the group-size effect on multiplying a collective asset, sensitive factors that induce a asymmetric group distribution are the group efficiency and the ratio of secured assets to assets pending in a competition. We show that social rejection to a minor group may occur when the group efficiency is relatively low and their asset is severely exposed to possible appropriation."
https://openalex.org/W2895199967,"Proteins, metabolites, and 16S rRNA measurements were used to examine the community structure and functional relationships within a cellulose degrading anaerobic bioreactor. The bioreactor was seeded with bovine rumen fluid and operated with a 4 day hydraulic retention time on cellulose (avicel) as sole carbon and energy source. The reactor performance and microbial community structure was monitored during the establishment of the cellulose-degrading community. After stable operation was established in the bioreactor, the mixing intensity was increased in order to investigate the effect of a physical disruption of the microbial community structure. Finally, the original conditions were re-established to understand the stability of the microbial community after a perturbation. All factors measured were found to be inter-correlated during these three distinct phases of operation (establishment, perturbation and re-establishment). In particular, the return of community structure and function to pre-perturbed conditions suggests that propionate fermentation and acetate utilization were the explanatory factors for community establishment and re-establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2895663782,"Cables play an important role in transmitting energy and information. In this article, in order to obtain the S-parameters of the special twisted pair cable with rectangular connectors, a de-embedding method of the transmission matrix is proposed to deal with the two adapters ends of the cable. According to the frequency-dependent RLGC(f) model, the cable characteristics are extracted in the frequency range of 10 MHz to 200 MHz through conventional and modified methods respectively. The frequency-domain analysis shows that the inherent capacity of modified method can decrease the errors especially due to the discontinuities of hyperbolic functions. This research supplies an advantageous modelling approach for the cable to improve its robustness against disturbances in the S-parameters measurement that cannot be decreased with the calibration procedure."
