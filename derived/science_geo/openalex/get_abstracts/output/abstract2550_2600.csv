https://openalex.org/W2079537380,"We hypothesize that the presence of progesterone receptors in human breast tumors may be a sensitive marker for predicting response to endocrine therapy. Progesterone receptors were found in 56 percent of tumors with estrogen receptors, but were absent in tumors without estrogen receptors. Preliminary clinical correlations show that only those breast tumors with progesterone receptors regressed after endocrine therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1518896112,"The adenylate cyclase activity of intact pigeon erythrocytes begins to rise after about 20 min of exposure to cholera toxin. The maximum rate at which the cyclase activity increases appears to be limited by the number of toxin molecules which can reach an intracellular target. If the erythrocytes are made permeable to the toxin by a bacterial hemolysin, no such limit exists, and adenylate cyclase activity starts to rise immediately upon the addition of toxin, and continues to rise to a maximum at an initially constant rate which is dependent upon the concentration of toxin. On lysed erythrocytes, the addition of cholera antitoxin immediately prevents any further rise in adenylate cyclase activity, but does not reverse any activation already achieved. Erythrocyte lysates may also be activated by isolated peptide A1 of cholera toxin, although activation of adenylate cyclase of intact erythrocytes requires the complete toxin molecule. In the intact cells, toxin first attaches by its Component B to surface receptors of which there are about 30 per erythrocyte. Subsequently, peptide A1 but not Component B is inserted into the erythrocyte. It takes only about 1 min at 37 degrees for peptide A1 to be sufficiently deep within the cell membrane to be inaccessible to extracellular antitoxin, but its complete transit through the membrane appears to take longer. The surface receptors are used only once, for they remain blocked by Component B. The number of receptors available on the surface may be increased by soaking cells in ganglioside GM1. Cholera toxin also decreases the rate of apparently spontaneous loss of adenylate cyclase activity and increases the response to epinephrine. Theophylline inhibits the action of cholera toxin."
https://openalex.org/W2113506485,"Frog (Rana catesbiana) rod outer segment disc membranes contain a cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) which is activated by light in the presence of ATP. This enzyme is firmly bound to the disc membrane, but can be eluted from the membrane with 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4 and 2 mM EDTA. The eluted phosphodiesterase has reduced activity, but can be activated approximately 10-fold by polycations such as protamine and polylysine. The eluted phosphodiesterase can no longer be activated by light in the presence of ATP, that is, activation by light apparently depends on the native orientation of phosphodiesterase in relationship to other disc membrane components. The eluted phosphodiesterase was purified to homogeneity as judged by analytical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing. The over-all purification from intact retina was approximately 925-fold. The purification of phosphodiesterase from the isolated rod outer segment preparation was about 185-fold with a 28% yield. Phosphodiesterase accounts for approximately 0.5% of the disc membrane protein. The eluted phosphodiesterase (inactive form) has a sedimentation coefficient of 12.4 S corresponding to an approximate molecular weight of 240,000. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis separates the purified phosphodiesterase into two subunits of 120,000 and 110,000 daltons. With cyclic 3':5'-GMP (cGMP) as substrate the Km for the purified phosphodiesterase is 70 muM. Protamine increases the Vmax without changing the Km for cGMP. The isoelectric point (pI) of the native dimer is 5.7. Limited exposure of the eluted phosphodiesterase (inactive form) to trypsin produces a somewhat greater activation than is obtained with 0.5 mg/ml of protamine. The trypsin-activated phosphodiesterase has a sedimentation coefficient of 7.8 S corresponding to an approximate molecular weight of 170,000. The 110,000-dalton subunit is much less sensitive to trypsin hydrolysis and the 120,000-dalton subunit is rapidly replaced by smaller fragments. On the basis of the molecular weight of the purified phosphodiesterase (240,000) and the concentrations of phosphodiesterase and rhodopsin in the rod outer segment, it is estimated that the molar ratio ophosphodiesterase to rhodopsin in the rod outer segment is approximately 1:900. Since all of the disc phosphodiesterase molecules are activated when 0.1% of the rhodopsins are bleached, we conclude that in the presence of ATP 1 molecule of bleached rhodopsin can activate 1 molecule of phosphodiesterase."
https://openalex.org/W1498043201,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme has been solubilized from a particulate fraction of rabbit lung and purified to apparent homogeneity in 11% yield by a procedure including fractionation with DEAE-cellulose and calcium phosphate gel, elution from Sephadex G-200, and lectin affinity chromatography. The molecular weight estimated by equilibrium sedimentation was approximately 129,000, either in the absence or presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. A slightly higher value of 140,000 determined for the reduced, denatured protein by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate and a much higher figure derived from gel filtration are probably due to the glycoprotein nature of the enzyme. Its oligosaccharide content accounted for 26% of the weight calculated from its amino acid and carbohydrate composition. The estimated content of sugar residues per mole was: galactose, 57; N-acetylglucosamine, 53; mannose, 43; N-acetylneuraminic acid, 19; and fucose, 4. Threonine and alanine were identified, respectively, as NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal residues by the dansylation procedure and by digestion with carboxypeptidase A. The enzyme was found to contain approximately 1 g atom of zinc per mol. Km values for hydrolysis of hippurylhistidylleucine and angiotensin I were 2.3 and 0.07 mM, and the corresponding turnover numbers were 15,430 and 792 mol/min/mol at 37 degrees. Bradykinin was also a substrate, and release of its COOH-terminal dipeptide, Phe-Arg, was catalyzed at a comparable rate to that of His-Leu from the COOH terminus of angiotensin I. Enzyme activity required the presence of chloride ions and was inhibited by EDTA and by low concentrations of Bothrops bradykinin-potentiating peptides. In addition, hydrolysis of hippurylhistidylleucine was inhibited competitively by other defined peptides, including di- and tripeptides, which were not substrates."

The tissue response is uniform throughout the epiphysis, whereas the cell response varies according to the area of origin."
https://openalex.org/W2125813431,"Eighty to 100 percent of female mice of the C3H/He strain carrying the Bittner oncogenic virus usually develop mammary tumors within 8 to 18 months after birth when studied under the usual housing and experimental conditions. By subjecting various groups of such mice to environmental circumstances providing different degrees of chronic stress, mammary tumor incidence at 400 days was modified, with incidences ranging from 92 percent under stress to 7 percent in a protected environment. The data suggest that moderate chronic or intermittent stress may predispose such mice to an increased risk of mammary carcinoma, possibly through a resultant compromise of their immunological competence or tumor surveillance system, and that adequate protection from physiological stress may reduce mammary tumor occurrence in mice."
https://openalex.org/W1559132754,"Glucagon can stimulate gluconeogenesis from 2 mM lactate nearly 4-fold in isolated liver cells from fed rats; exogenous cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) is equally effective, but epinephrine can stimulate only 1.5-fold. Half-maximal effects are obtained with glucagon at 0.3 nM, cyclic AMP at 30 muM and epinephrine at 0.2 muM. Insulin reduces by 50% the stimulation by suboptimal concentrations of glucagon (0.5 nM). A half-maximal effect is obtained with 0.3 nM insulin (45 microunits/ml). Glucagon in the presence of theophylline (1 mM) causes a rapid rise and subsequent fall in intracellular cyclic AMP with a peak between 3 and 6 min. Some of the fall can be accounted for by loss of nucleotide into the medium. This efflux is suppressed by probenecid, suggesting the presence of a membrane transport mechanism for the cyclic nucleotide. Glucagon can raise intracellular cyclic AMP about 30-fold; a half-maximal effect is obtained with 1.5 nM hormone. Epinephrine (plus theophylline, 1 mM) can raise intracellular cyclic AMP about 2-fold; the peak elevation is reached in less than 1 min and declines during the next 15 min to near the basal level. Insulin (10 nM) does not lower the basal level of cyclic AMP within the hepatocyte, but suppresses by about 50% the rise in intracellular and total cyclic AMP caused by exposure to an intermediate concentration of glucagon. No inhibition of adenylate cyclase by insulin can be shown. Basal gluconeogenesis is not significantly depressed by calcium deficiency but stimulation by glucagon is reduced by 50%. Calcium deficiency does not reduce accumulation of cyclic AMP in response to glucagon but diminishes stimulation of gluconeogenesis by exogenous cyclic AMP. Glucagon has a rapid stimulatory effect on the flux of 45Ca2+ from medium to tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1556158097,"Upon infection of Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO), vesicular stomatitis (VSV) virus synthesizes two membrane proteins (the VSV glycoprotein and the VSV matrix or membrane (M) protein) and three nonmembrane proteins (the VSV nucleocapsid, the viral transcriptase, and an NS protein). We have used the VSV-infected cell as a model system for the study of the site of synthesis of these membrane and nonmembrane proteins. We have isolated VSV mRNA from free polyribosomes, membrane-bound polyribosomes, and the postribosomal supernatant, and identified the individual species of VSV mRNA present in each fraction. The mRNA which encodes the VSV glycoprotein is found exclusively on membrane-bound polyribosomes, while the mRNAs which encode the VSV, M, N, and NS proteins are found in free polyribosomes, in the membrane fraction of the cell, and in the postribosomal supernatant. Our results suggest that the VSV glycoprotein is synthesized exclusively on membrane polyribosomes, while at least some of the M, N, and NS proteins are made on free polyribosomes."
https://openalex.org/W2162073688,"The limited capacity, high affinity binding of 35 iodothyronine analogues by rat liver nuclei has been examined in an in vitro system. The in vitro nuclear binding of all the analogues tested was highly correlated with their published thyromimetic potencies in the intact animals. Binding and biological activity are greater for 3'-mono-than 3',5'-di-substituted iodothyronines. A 4'-hydroxyl group is essential, but the 3' substituent can be several halogen or non-halogen groups for which the distal conformation is preferred. The ether linkage can be replaced equally well by a methylene or sulfur group. The presence of both 3 and 5 groups which are limited to halogens or small alkyl groups are necessary for the maintenance of significant activity. Halogen-free iodothyronines have very low, but significant activity both in vitro and in vivo. The data provide information on the structural requirements for thyroid hormone action and further support the physiological relevance of the nuclear sites."
https://openalex.org/W1489408990,"Evidence for the formation of singlet oxygen during the oxidation of NADPH by liver microsomes is presented. The evidence is based primarily on the enzyme-dependent formation of dibenzoylethylene from diphenylfuran, a reaction which is specific for singlet oxygen. The apparent formation of singlet oxygen is coupled to the occurrence of peroxidation of microsomal lipid, a phenomenon known to be associated with NADPH oxidation by the particles. Both the peroxidation of lipid and the apparent formation of singlet oxygen are related to the amount of Fe3+ present in the system and the results are consistent with the possibility that the singlet oxygen formed by this system is derived from the breakdown of lipid peroxides. If 1O2 is formed from breakdown of lipid peroxides, it would be dependent on O-/-2 formation because superoxide anion has been shown to undergo reactions in this system which generate extremely reactive free radicals (probably hydroxyl) that initiate lipid peroxidation. These peroxides are quite unstable and their degradation may be the source of 1O2. We have consistently observed that O-/-2 itself is not a reactive radical with respect to lipids or radical scavengers. Hence, O-/-2 cannot be the radical which initiates lipid peroxidation on which 1O2 generation appears to depend. The results may offer at least part of the explanation for the dietary requirement for alpha-tocopherol which not only scavenges free radicals but quenches singlet oxygen as well. This report also includes description of studies indicating that another enzyme, xanthine oxidase, which forms superoxide anion during its activity under aerobic conditions, does not form singlet oxygen during its function. This finding is in contrast to reports of others which indicate that xanthine oxidase activity does produce 1O2."

https://openalex.org/W1561153362,"The aromatic regions in proton-decoupled natural abundance 13C Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance spectra (at 14.2 kG) of small native proteins contain broad methine carbon bands and narrow nonprotonated carbon resonances. Some factors that affect the use of natural abundance 13C Fourier transform NMR spectroscopy for monitoring individual nonprotonated aromatic carbon sites of native proteins in solution are discussed. The effect of protein size is evaluated by comparing the 13C NMR spectra of horse heart ferrocytochrome c, hen egg white lysozyme, horse carbon monoxide myoglobin, and human adult carbon monoxide hemoglobin. Numerous single carbon resonances are observed in the aromatic regions of 13C NMR spectra of cytochrome c, lysozyme, and myoglobin. The much larger hemoglobin yields few resolved individual carbon resonances. Theoretical and some experimental values are presented for the natural linewidths (W), spin-lattice relaxation times (T1), and nuclear Overhauser enhancements (NOE) of nonprotonated aromatic carbons and Czeta of arginine residues. In general, the 13C-1H dipolar mechanism dominates the relaxation of these carbons. 13C-14N dipolar relaxation contributes significantly to 1/T1 of C epsilon2 of tryptophan residues and Czeta of arginine residues of proteins in D2O. The NOE of each nonprotonated aromatic carbon is within experimental error of the calculated value of about 1.2. As a result, integrated intensities can be used for making a carbon count. Theoretical results are presented for the effect of internal rotation on W, T1, and the NOE. A comparison with the experimental T1 and NOE values indicates that if there is internal rotation of aromatic amino acid side chains, it is not fast relative to the over-all rotational motion of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W1576816577,"Heat-denatured chicken egg white lysozyme and the reduced carboxymethylated maleylated derivative of this protein were found to serve as substrates for rabbit skeletal muscle cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The native form of the protein was not a substrate. Two phosphoryl groups per mole of lysozyme were incorporated in the reaction. It was determined that the phosphoryl moieties were bound to serine 24 and serine 50 in the modified protein. Serine 24 was phosphorylated approximately 3 times as fast as serine 50. Reduced carboxymethylated maleylated derivatives of bovine serum albumin, phosphorylase b, and creatine kinase also served as substrates for the protein kinase whereas their native forms did not. The reduced carboxymethylated maleylated derivative of the inhibitory subunit of troponin was a poorer substrate than the native form of the protein. Maleylated histones F1 and F2b were also poorer substrates than the nonderivatized forms. The significance of these experiments with reference to the specificity of cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1583815618,"Rat fat cells incubated with lipolytic agents released substances to the medium which acted as feedback regulators of cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation. The feedback regulators were not removed by adenosine deaminase. Dialyzed medium that had previously been incubated with fat cells in the presence of norepinephrine markedly inhibited cyclic AMP accumulation by fresh cells, whereas dialyzed medium from control cells did not inhibit cyclic AMP accumulation. The effects of lipolytic agents could be mimicked by adding dialyzed medium previously incubated with fat cells in the presence of oleic acid. This suggested that free fatty acids were the nondialyzable and adenosine deaminase-insensitive inhibitors of cyclic AMP accumulation released to the medium by fat cells incubated with lipolytic agents. The regulatory function of free fatty acids was related to the molar ratio of fatty acid to albumin. Profound inhibition of both lipolysis and cyclic AMP accumulation was seen as the free fatty acid/albumin ratio exceeded 3. The inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation by oleate was seen as soon as there was a detectable increase in cyclic AMP due to lipolytic agents. Protein kinase activity (in the presence of cyclic AMP) of the infranatant obtained after centrifugation of fat cell homogenates at 48,000 x g was inhibited by medium from cells incubated with lipolytic agents or added oleate. Adenylate cyclase activity of rat fat cell ghosts was also inhibited by dialyzed or nondialyzed medium that previously had been incubated with lipolytic agents or added fatty acids. The direct addition of oleate markedly inhibited adenylate cyclase activity as the free fatty acid/albumin ratio exceeded 2. These data suggest that the prolonged drop in cyclic AMP accumulation seen during the incubation of rat fat cells with lipolytic agents is due to the inhibition of adenylate cyclase. This occurs when the free fatty acid/albumin ratio exceeds 3."
https://openalex.org/W1503983718,"The thyrotropin receptor from bovine thyroid plasma membranes has been solubilized using lithium diiodosalicylate, and an assay to measure thyrotropin binding to the solubilized receptor has been developed. Both the solubilized thyrotropin receptor and the thyrotropin receptor on thyroid plasma membranes have effectively identical nonlinear Scatchard plots and negatively sloped Hill plots, i.e. both preparations have receptors which appear to exhibit a similar negatively cooperative relationship. Although the pH optimum of thyrotropin binding to the solubilized receptor is the same as that of the thyroid plasma membrane receptor, pH 6.0, the pH dependency curve of the solubilized receptor is slightly different in its outline. Thyrotropin binding to the solubilized receptor is less sensitive to salt inhibition than is binding to the thyroid plasma membrane receptor; however, optimal binding remains at 0 degrees. The relative affinities of thyrotropin and two glycoprotein hormones which can be considered structural analogs, luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin, are 100:10:5, respectively, toward plasma membrane receptors, but 100:25:40 toward the solubilized receptors. The solubilized receptor preparation is heterogeneous in size in that it has binding components with molecular weights of 286,000, 160,000, 75,000, and 15,000 to 30,000. Tryptic digestion converts all three higher molecular weight components to the 15,000 to 30,000 molecular weight species, and the 15,000 to 30,000 molecular weight receptor component has all of the binding properties of the solubilized receptor preparation before tryptic digestion including an identical nonlinear Scatchard plot. It has the same size as and coelutes from Sephadex G-100 with a 15,000 to 30,000 molecular weight receptor released by tryptic digestion of bovine thyroid plasma membranes or tryptic digestion of bovine or dog thyroid cells in culture. The tryptic fragment of the solubilized receptor or preparations has been purified almost 250-fold by affinity chromatography on thyrotropin-Sepharose columns. The binding activity is lost when the solubilized thyrotropin receptor preparation is exposed to beads of neuraminidase-Sepharose or conconavalin A-Sepharose."
https://openalex.org/W1491229680,"Biologically active bovine 125I-thyrotropin preparations have been prepared, characterized, and used to evaluate the optimal conditions for thyrotropin binding to bovine thyroid plasma membranes in vitro. Binding of 125I-TSH has a pH optimum around 6.0 and is sensitive to the choice and concentration of buffer. Binding is inhibited by salts, especially those containing magnesium and calcium ions; magnesium concentrations optimal for adenylate cyclase assays (2 to 5 mM) result in 85 to 98% inhibition of binding. Binding is temperature sensitive. At 37 degrees binding has its highest initial level; however, instability of the membrane at this temperature causes a rapid loss of binding activity. Binding at 0 degrees is optimal in 30 min and at the same level as initial binding at 37 degrees; since there is no decrease in binding activity, it has been chosen as the optimal temperature. Thyrotropin, luteinizing hormone, the beta subunit of thyrotropin, and the alpha subunit of thyrotropin have relative binding affinities for the thyrotropin receptors of 100, 10, 2, and less than 0.5, respectively. In all of these characteristics, 125I-thyrotropin at 1.5 x 10(-5) M concentrations has the same properties of binding to bovine plasma membranes as do [3H]thyrotropin preparations which have been previously characterized (Amir, S.M., Carraway, T.F., Jr., Kohn, L.D., and Winand, R.V. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 4092-4100) and used to study binding at 5 x 10(-6) M concentrations. 125I-TSH binding as a function of hormone concentration results in curved Scatchard plots; however, Hill plots of these same binding data are linear and have a slope of 0.65. Taken together, these data suggest that the heterogeneity in thyrotropin binding constants which is evident in the Scatchard plot reflects a negatively cooperative relationship among the thyrotropin receptor sites, i.e. decreased hormonal affinity as hormone concentrations increase. Adenylate cyclase studies yield kinetic plots which also exhibit negative cooperativity; corrections for thyrotropin bound under the adverse binding conditions of the adenylate cyclase assays suggest that Km values for thyrotropin in this enzymatic assay are compatible with binding constants measured by the 125I-thyrotropin preparations. Tryptic digestion destroys binding activity on the thyroid plasma membrane but releases specific thyrotropin receptor activity into the supernatant phase. Chromatography on Sephadex G-100 indicates that this solubilized receptor fragment has a molecular weight between 15,000 and 30,000."

If thyrotropin is added 48 hours after trypsinization, these cells do not form follicle-like structures but remain as a monolayer culture. Although thyroid cells which grow as a monolayer have a thyrotropin receptor on their plasma membranes with the same in vitro binding properties as the thyrotropin receptor on the plasma membranes of the follicle-forming thyroid cells, there is a 1- to 2-fold greater number of receptors per mg of membrane protein when follicle-forming and monolayer cultures are compared..."

https://openalex.org/W1569404765,"At characteristic temperatures, membranes from Escherichia coli cells enriched in exogenous elaidic acid exhibit two abrupt changes in the slope of Arrhenius plots of two enzyme activities. For NADH oxidase, these changes occur at 27 degrees and 32 degrees, whereas for D-lactate oxidase, these changes occur at 31 degrees and 36 degrees. Pyrene excimer fluorescence and spin-labeled fatty acid paramagnetic resonance results indicate that the beginning, midpoint, and end of a single structural change(order leads to disorder transition) occurs at 25.5-29.0 degrees, 30.0-31.0 degrees, and 33.0-35.5 degrees, respectively. These data suggest that for NADH oxidase, the observed activity changes correspond to the beginning and midpoint of a single membrane lipid structural change, whereas for D-lactate, the activity changes correspond to the midpoint and end of that structural change. In addition to the membrane structural change spanning the range of 25.5-35.5 degrees, a second change (9.5-21.0 degrees) was also observed. This transition was detected by 5- and 16-2,2-dimethyloxazolidinyl-1-oxyl (doxyl) stearates, but not by 12-doxyl stearate or pyrene. Structural changes in the extracted lipids were observed in the temperature ranges 4.0-9.0 degrees, 14.0-20.0 degrees, and 25.0-35.5 degrees. The two higher ranges correlate well with the ranges for structural changes observed in the intact membrane. Observations of these multiple transitions in both intact membranes and extracted lipids strongly suggest that these lipids segregate into domains of different fluidity and composition."

In all of the protein spectra we have examined, methine aromatic carbons give rise to broad bands. Studies of the narrow resonances of nonprotonated aromatic carbons of proteins are facilitated by removal of these broad bands by means of the convolution-difference method, preferably from spectra recorded under conditions of noise-modulated off-resonance proton decoupling. We present a summary of the chemical shift ranges for the various types of nonprotonated aromatic carbons of amino acid residues and hemes of diamagnetic proteins, based on our results for hen egg white lysozyme, horse heart ferrocytochrome c, horse carbon monoxide myoglobin, and carbon monoxide hemoglobins from various species..."
https://openalex.org/W1568068653,"Linked oscillations of the glycolytic pathway and the purine nucleotide cycle were studied in particle-free extracts of rat skeletal muscle. Under the conditions used, an accumulation of about 1 muM fructose diphosphate can trigger a sudden increase in phosphofructokinase activity. The activation by fructose diphosphate depends on the presence of AMP. When the AMP concentration drops, phosphofructokinase becomes inhibited, even though the fructose disphosphate concentration remains high. It is concluded that the oscillatory behavior can be of advantage for maintaining a high average [ATP]/[ADP] ratio."
https://openalex.org/W1507515478,"The AI polypeptide chain from human high density serum lipoprotein has two accessible conformational states in aqueous solution. L-alpha-Palmitoyl lysophosphatidylcholine induces the transition between these two states at an equilibrium concentration of ligand of 2 X 10(-5)M, and the protein has a maximum binding capacity of 95 to 100 mol of lipid/mol of protein. The present study, together with previous investigations in this laboratory, suggests that the conformational state of AI in the presence of high levels of bound amphiphiles is similar to the in vivo state, and further, that this complex does not result from the insertion of AI into amphiphilic micelles. The mode of interaction of AI with amphiphilic ligands is shown to be significantly different from that of membrane proteins thus far investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1491490245,"The denatured alpha1(I) chain and the cyanogen bromide peptide, alpha1(I)-CB5, of chick skin collagen cause the release of serotonin and leakage of lactic dehydrogenase from human platelets in a manner similar to the release reaction mediated by adenosine diphosphate and native collagen. These peptides also cause a decrease in the level of adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets. Adenylate cyclase activity of platelets is partially inhibited by these peptides as well as by native collagen, ADP, and epinephrine, but cAMP phosphodiesterase activity is unaltered by these substances. In contrast, the level of platelet guanosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cGMP) is increased by the collagen peptides as well as the other aggregating agents. The increase is associated with increased guanylate cyclase, but normal cGMP phosphodiesterase activities of platelets. Optical rotatory and viscometric measurements of the alpha1 chains and alpha1-CB5 of chick skin in 0.01 M phosphate/0.15 M sodium chloride, pH 7.4, at various temperatures as a function of time indicate that no detectable renaturation occurs at 37 degrees for at least 30 min of observation. Molecular sieve chromatography of alpha1-CB5 in the phosphate buffer at 37 degrees shows that its elution position is identical to that performed under denaturing conditions (at 45 degrees) with no evidence of higher molecular weight aggregates, and the alpha1-CB5 glycopeptide fraction eluting from the column at the position of its monomer retains the platelet aggregating activity. Additionally, electron microscopic examination of the platelet-rich plasma that had been reacted with these peptides fail to show any ordered collagen structures. These data indicate that the denatured alpha1 chain and alpha1-CB5 glycopeptide of chick skin collagen mediate platelet aggregation through the physiologic release reaction in a manner similar to that induced by other aggregating agents such as ADP, epinephrine, or native collagen, and support the conclusion that the aggregating activity of the alpha1 chain and alpha1-CB5 is not likely to be due to the formation of polymerized products."

https://openalex.org/W1565787013,"An insoluble phosphoprotein of rat brain acquires radioactivity from inorganic phosphate more rapidly during sleep than during wakefulness. It was purified in two ways. The first was solvent delipidation of brain tissue followed by preparative sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The second was sucrose gradient centrifugation of a brain homogenate to remove myelin, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 and adsorption chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex in the presence of sodium deoxycholate. The products were homogeneous within the limits of the analytical methods used. The apparent molecular weight of the phosphoprotein was 28,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, but was much higher in the presence of sodium deoxycholate. The protein had a high content of aspartic and glutamic acids compared to basic amino acids. Analysis of a base hydrolysate, as well as studies of the kinetics of hydrolysis, showed that the radioactive phosphorus was attached to histidine. The NH2-terminal residue was identified as isoleucine. The phosphoprotein purified by the second method was enzymatically active. When it was incubated in vitro with a 32P-labeled supernatant fraction from rat brain (and later with glucose [6-32P]phosphate), a radioactive phosphorylated protein intermediate was formed. Exploration of the several enzymatic activities of the preparation indicated close correspondence to those reported for the glucose-6-phosphatases of liver and kidney. Glucose-6-phosphatase activity was found in all parts of the brain in the membranous subcellular fractions of neurons. It was shown to be co-purified with the sleep-related phosphoprotein. This report constitutes, we believe, the first complete purification of glucose-6-phosphatase from any tissue and an instance in which a change in the state of a cerebral enzyme has been linked to a normal change in the physiological state of the brain."

Structural differences between the normal and mutant enzymes are indicated by a lower isoelectric point for the mutant enzyme (pI 4.85) than for the normal enzyme (pI 5.10); decreased electrophoretic mobility of the mutant preparation on cellulose acetate gel at low inorganic phosphate concentrations; increased (2.4-fold) inactivation of the mutant enzyme activity relative to the normal by identical amounts of a specific antiserum which precipitates identical quantities of normal and mutant enzyme; increased thermal lability of the mutant enzyme at 55 degrees; and an increased (2.2-fold) specific enzyme activity for the mutant enzyme despite the comparable purity of the preparations. Antibody inactivation, quantitative precipitin, and immunodiffusion studies as well as the disparity in specific enzyme activities during the course of purification suggest that a structural alteration in the mutant enzyme leads to increased catalytic activity per enzyme molecule, either from a primary alteration in the structural gene(s) for phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase or from a post-transcriptional alteration in the enzyme. Purified preparations of normal and mutant enzymes showed nearly identical affinity constants for magnesium and the substrates, ATP and ribose 5-phosphate, as well as similar inhibition constants for the products, PP-ribose-P and AMP, and the inhibitors ADP, GDP, and 2,3-diphosphoglycerate. An increased maximal velocity of the reaction was, thus, the sole kinetic difference identified. The increased velocity of the mutant enzyme reaction was constant over a range of inorganic phosphate concentrations from 0.1 to 100 mM. Subunit molecular weights of the enzyme preparations, estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, were identical (32,000), although the undenatured mutant enzyme showed a greater proportion of stainable protein in the smaller of two molecular weight forms (both greater than 500,000) of the enzyme demonstrated on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 1 mM sodium phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1543361103,"Cytidine diphosphate diglyceride was isolated from beef liver by a combination of silicic acid column, DEAE-cellulose column, and this layer chromatography. The product (5.8 to 17.4 mumol/kg of liver) contained cytidine/phosphate/fatty acids in the molar proportions 1.05/2.0/2.05 (theoretical, 1.0/2.0/2.0) (average for three preparations). The liponucleotide was split quantitatively by a partially purified hydrolase from Escherichia coli, specific for CDP-diglyceride, (Raetz, C. R. H., Hirschberg, C. B., Dowhan, W., Wickner, W. T., and Kennedy, E. P. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 2245-2247) into phosphatidic acid and a water-soluble nucleotide that was chromatographically identical with CMP. No dCMP was located in these hydrolysates. The liver liponucleotide was more effective than a synthetic preparation of CDP-diglyceride in promoting the formation of phosphatidylinositol with guinea pig brain microsomes. The fatty acid composition of CDP-diglyceride was compared with metabolically related phospholipids from beef liver. The liponucleotide had a similar composition to phosphatidylinositol, characterized by a high level of stearate and with arachidonate as the major unsaturated fatty acid. The content of arachidonate in both lipids was significantly higher than that in phosphatidic acid. The profile of fatty acids of cardiolipin was quite unlike that of CDP-diglyceride. These findings suggest several alternatives for the metabolic origins of beef liver CDP-diglyceride: (a) CDP-diglyceride is formed from an atypical pool of phosphatidic acid, (b) the enzyme is selective for arachidonoyl-containing species of phosphatidic acid, (c) the liponucleotide may also be derived from phosphatidylinositol by the back-reaction of CDP-diglyceride: inositol phosphatidyltransferase."

https://openalex.org/W1548927134,"The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of the major group-specific antigen, the major internal virion protein (p30; approximate molecular weight 30,000) of several mammalian type C RNA viruses was determined by the Edman degradation procedure using an automated protein sequenator. All of the proteins analyzed show a high degree of over-all sequence homology and also contain specific regions or single residues. All p30s begin with the sequence prolyl-leucylarginyl (Pro-Leu-Arg) and have an invariant, conserved region from residues 11 to 24. In this region only a single amino acid difference appears between the cat and mouse p30s. At position 17 alanine is found in the cat, and serine in all the mouse proteins. This homologous region starts at position 10 for RD-114 and baboon virus p30s, and at position 18 in the protein of the virus isolated from gibbon ape. The region extending from residue 4 to 10 shows considerable variability between p30s isolated from different mammalian species. Out of 24 residues compared, only a single amino acid difference was found between six different mouse p30s. At position 4, three have leucine, two have alanine, and one has serine. The comparative sequence data demonstrate that the viral p30s are products of related genes in the viruses from various mammalian species."
https://openalex.org/W1498955334,"Reaction of the NADP-dependent glutamate dehydrogenase of Neurospora with 1,2-cyclohexanedione results in a biphasic loss of enzyme activity. At the end of the rapid phase of the reaction (t1/2 = 1.5 min) the enzyme activity is diminished by approximately 60% with the simultaneous loss of 1 residue of arginine per subunit. After 60 min, the enzyme activity is completely lost with the modification of a total of 2 arginine residues per subunit. Reaction of bovine liver glutamate dehydrogenase with cyclohexanedione causes a rapid loss of approximately 45% of the enzyme activity and modification of about 1.5 residues of arginine per subunit. More prolonged treatment results in reaction of an additional 4 residues of arginine per subunit but is without further effect on the residual activity. The activity of the Neurospora enzyme is not protected by substrate, coenzyme, or a combination of both; however, the activity of the bovine enzyme is partially protected by high levels of NAD or NADP. Although the Km for alpha-ketoglutarate is unchanged by a limited modification of either enzyme with cyclohexanedione, the Km for coenzyme is increased about 2-fold for the Neurospora enzyme and about 1.5-fold for the bovine enzyme. The Ki of the Neurospora dehydrogenase for the competitive inhibitor 2'-monophosphoadenosine-5'-diphosphoribose is unchanged by the enzyme modification, but nicotinamide mononucleotide, a competitive inhibitor for the native Neurospora enzyme, does not inhibit the glutamate dehydrogenase with 1 modified arginine residue. This finding implies that the modified arginine is at or near the nicotinamide binding iste of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1656837256,"The specific interaction between 17 beta-estradiol-receptor complex and nuclear acceptors was analyzed by immobilizing various nuclear proteins to CNBr-activated agarose. The specific, high affinity sites identified in a fraction of basic proteins that can be solubilized from purified nuclei of calf uterus (Puca, G.A., Sica, V., and Nola. E (1974) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 71, 979-983) were chromatographed on Sephadex G-100 columns. Elution of the acceptor activity depends on the pH and ionic strength of the buffer used. With 5 mM HCl, however, a peak of acceptor activity with a molecular weight of about 70,000 was partially dissociated from the other basic nuclear proteins. The high affinity binding of the receptor to the acceptor proteins was estradiol-, but not progesterone-, cortisone-, or testosterone-dependent; it was very sensitive to ionic strength and showed a physiological pH optimum. Low affinity binding, such as that seen between receptor and histone, showed no estradiol dependence and little ionic strength and pH sensitivity. Native or heat-denatured DNA strongly modified the receptor-acceptor interaction, reducing the number of binding sites of acceptor for the receptor without changing the high affinity of the interaction. Heating of the acceptor protein before its covalent linkage to agarose considerably increased the affinity of the resulting agarose derivative. Free sulfhydryl groups of the receptor but not of the acceptor molecule play an important role in the acceptor-receptor interaction. When receptor and acceptor preparations were incubated in solution, the resulting complex was included on a Sephadex G-100 column and it eluted from DEAE-cellulose columns at lower ionic strength than the receptor alone. Even though not absolutely specific, these two properties allowed determination of the molecular weight (85,000) of the acceptor protein at neutral pH and more nearly physiological ionic strength. The apparent KD of the acceptor-receptor interaction was determined to be 2 x 10(-10) M at O degrees. Apparently similar, high affinity binding sites for estradiol receptors are also present in nuclei of other tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1499159480,"Using a homogeneous enzyme from rabbit skeletal muscle, it has been demonstrated that the cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)-dependent protein kinase reaction is reversible. In addition to the phosphorylated protein substrate, the reverse reaction requires Mg2+, ADP, and cyclic AMP when the holoenzyme is used as the source of enzyme. It is independent of cyclic AMP when the catalytic subunit of the protein kinase is used. The optimum pH for the reverse reaction with 32P-labeled casein as the substrate is 5.7, essentially the same as that for the forward reaction. Among the nucleotide subtrates tested, ADP serves as the best phosphoryl group acceptor. The Km of the enzyme for ADP is 3.3 mM and that for 32P-casein is 1.7 mg/ml. The equilibrium constant at 30 degrees is approximately 0.042 at a magnesium concentration of 10 mM and a pH of 6.9. This result indicates that the free energy of hydrolysis (deltaG0obs) of the phosphorylated protein substrate is relatively high, i.e. approximately -6.5 kcal/mol under these conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1551239782,"The prostaglandin endoperoxide PGH2 (15-hydroxy-9alpha, 11alpha-peroxidoprosta-5,13-dienoic acid), at a concentration of 2.8 x 10(-5) M inhibited basal adenylate cyclase activity 11% and epinephrine-stimulated activity 30 to 35%. PGH2 inhibited epinephrine-stimulated enzyme activity in the presence of 10 mM theophylline, 2.5 mM adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP), or in the absence of inhibitors or substrates of the cAMP phosphodiesterase. When the cAMP phosphodiesterase was assayed directly using 62 nM and 1.1 muM cAMP, PGH2 did not affect the 100,000 x g particulate cAMP phosphodiesterase from fat cells. The inhibition of adenylate cyclase by PGH2 was readily reversible. A 6-min preincubation of ghost membranes with PGH2, followed by washing, did not alter subsequent epinephrine-stimulated adenylate cyclase activity. During epinephrine stimulation, the PGH2 inhibition was apparent on initial rates of cAMP synthesis, and the addition of PGH2 to the enzyme system at any point during an assay markedly reduced the rate of cAMP synthesis. Between 2.8 x 10(-7) M and 2.8 x 10(-5) M, PGH2 inhibited epinephrine-stimulated enzyme activity in a concentration-dependent manner. The stimulation of adenylate cyclase by thyroid-stimulating hormone, glucagon, and adrenocorticotropic hormone as well as by epinephrine was antagonized by PGH2, suggesting that PGH2 may be an endogenous feedback regulator of hormone-stimulated lipolysis in adipose tissue."
https://openalex.org/W1512409293,"Fat cells isolated from the mesenteric adipose tissue of chickens (pullets) responded to glucagon with an increase in lipolysis and a sustained rise in cyclic adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) over a 30-min incubation. The prolonged accumulation of cyclic AMP due to glucagon in chicken fat cells was primarily intracellular. In addition, there was little increase in cyclic AMP accumulation due to theophylline alone or potentiation of the increase due to glucagon. These data indicate that chicken fat cells, unlike rat fat cells, are relatively insensitive to theophylline. Neither lipolysis nor cyclic AMP accumulation by chicken fat cells was inhibited by free fatty acid to albumin ratios (3 to 7) which markedly reduced both events in rat fat cells. However, in the absence of albumin from the medium, lipolysis in chicken fat cells was reduced, but not to the same extent as in rat fat cells. Chicken fat cells did accumulate more intracellular free fatty acids in response to lipolytic agents than did rat fat cells. The uptake of oleate by rat and chicken fat cells was identical. Glucagon-induced accumulation of cyclic AMP by chicken fat cell ghosts was unaffected by added oleate. Under identical conditions glucagon-induced adenylate cyclase activity of rat fat cell ghosts was markedly inhibited by added oleate. Triglyceride lipase activity of the pH 5.2 precipitate from a 40,000 x g infranatant of homogenized fat cells from chickens was less sensitive than that from rat fat cells to the ratio of oleate to albumin. These results suggest that the maintenance of cyclic AMP levels in chicken fat cells incubated with lipolytic agents results from the relative insensitivity of chicken fat cells to free fatty acid inhibition of cyclic AMP accumulation."

https://openalex.org/W2143081505,"EPR studies of Mn2+ binding to bovine pancreatic deoxyribonuclease I show that the enzyme can bind three Mn2+ ions at pH 7.5 and 2 degrees. Two sites bind Mn2+ strongly, with a Kd of 10(-4)M, and the third binds Mn2+ weakly, with a Kd of 10(-3)M. Ca2+ competes with the two strong sites, whereas Mg2+ competes only with one of them, indicating that both sites are not equivalent. Mn2+ binding to DNA has been confirmed by EPR measurements. Two types of sites, with different affinities for Mn2+ binding, were found on DNA molecules, one with a Kd of 1.2 times 10(-4)M and the other with a Kd of 10(-3)M. Mg2+ ions can displace Mn2+ from the high affinity sites, but not from the low affinity sites. These results suggest the Mn2+ binds not only to the phosphate groups, but also to the electron donor groups of the base rings."
https://openalex.org/W1589203754,"The modification of the carboxyl groups of the subunits of bovine luteinizing hormone to neutral derivatives by carbodiimide-mediated coupling with glycine methyl ester has been studied. The modified alpha subunit, which has 8 residues of glycine methyl ester incorporated, will no longer recombine with native beta (hormone-specific) subunit, but the modified beta subunit, with 6 to 7 glycine methyl esters incorporated, will recombine with native alpha to yield a partially active hormone. Derivatization of the intact hormone results in dissociation to subunits together with formation of a major side product which is covalently cross-linked. Significant cross-linked product was not obtained during modification of individual subunits, thus indicating an orientation between an activated carboxyl group(s) and a nucleophile(s) in the intact hormone which favors coupling. Separation of subunits from the derivatized, noncross-linked fraction by countercurrent distribution reveals a heterogeneous preparation of the modified alpha subunit which also will not recombine with either a native or modified beta subunit. The beta subunit from the modified intact hormone was indistinguishable from the modified isolated beta subunit in amino acid composition and in ability to recombine with native alpha subunit. The results are consonant with data from this and other laboratories in which various modifications of the alpha chain, the subunit common to the glycoproteins, more seriously affect recombination than similar modifications of the beta subunits. The number of carboxyl groups modified in each subunit is compatible with but not in total agreement with assignments of amides reported from sequence studies."

https://openalex.org/W1546312818,"1. Ferricytochrome c1 solution was reduced completely between pH 7 and 10 by illumination under anaerobic conditions. Photoreduction was not affected by the ionic strength of the medium. However, it did not take place at pH lower than 6 or higher than 10, or in the presence of p-hydroxymercuric benzoate. The ferricyanide-reoxidized photoreduced c1 was not further reduced upon illumination. The reductant was most probably a specific sulfhydryl group in the subunit containing the heme of the cytochrome since this subunit contained one less p-HMB-titratable group in the photoreduced sample than in the untreated preparation. 2. The photoreduced cytochrome c1 showed the same spectra as the native cytochrome, and was not reactive with carbon monoxide. The equilibrium constant of the reaction c12+ + c3+ equilibrium c13+ + c2+ for the photoreduced c1 was found to be slightly lower (Keq = 2.6) than that for the native c1 (Keq = 3.5). The antimycin A-sensitive electron acceptor activity of ferricyanide-reoxidized photoreduced c13+ catalyzed by succinate-cytochrome c reductase was about 80% of that of the native c1. 3. A somewhat simplified method for isolation of cytochrome c1 was developed. Anaerobic ammonium sulfate fractionation and calcium phosphate gel chromatography were still used in order to achieve the purity level of about 25 nmol of heme/mg of protein. The cytochrome c1 prepared by this procedure showed the same properties tested as that by the beta-mercaptoethanol method (Yu, C.A., Yu, L., and King, T.E. (1972) J. Biol. Chem. 247, 1012-1019)."

https://openalex.org/W2127469350,"Abstract Synthesis of 2,4-bis(bromomethyl)estradiol-17 beta 3-methyl ether (BBE2M) was accomplished by reducing a methanolic solution of 2,4-bis(bromomethyl)estrone methyl ether with sodium borohydride. In 0.5 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 25 degrees, BBE2M readily reacts with Ellman's anion and alkylates cysteine to form a steroid-amino acid conjugate. Stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that the bromosteroid is divalent with cysteine. Tryptophan and histidine react more slowly with the bromosteroid. Estrogenic activity of BBE2M was evaluated in ovariectomized rats by uterine intraluminal administration and quantitation of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (D-glucose-6-P:NADP+ oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.49) activity in the uterus. BBE2M induced glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity as did estradiol-17 beta or estradiol-17 beta 3-methyl ether (E2M). BBE2M was more persistent in activity than E2M. Histological examination of uterus following BBE2M treatment shows classic estrogenic morphology. BBE2M covalently binds to the cytoplasmic estrogen receptor of calf uterus. Such binding is prevented by pretreatment of the receptor protein with estradiol-17 beta. The covalently bound steroid-receptor complex appears to stimulate RNA synthesis in isolated nuclei from calf endometrium."
