https://openalex.org/W2033202128,"The mapping of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) has emerged as an important tool for linking genetic variation to changes in gene regulation. However, it remains difficult to identify the causal variants underlying eQTLs, and little is known about the regulatory mechanisms by which they act. Here we show that genetic variants that modify chromatin accessibility and transcription factor binding are a major mechanism through which genetic variation leads to gene expression differences among humans. We used DNase I sequencing to measure chromatin accessibility in 70 Yoruba lymphoblastoid cell lines, for which genome-wide genotypes and estimates of gene expression levels are also available. We obtained a total of 2.7 billion uniquely mapped DNase I-sequencing (DNase-seq) reads, which allowed us to produce genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility for each individual. We identified 8,902 locations at which the DNase-seq read depth correlated significantly with genotype at a nearby single nucleotide polymorphism or insertion/deletion (false discovery rate = 10%). We call such variants 'DNase I sensitivity quantitative trait loci' (dsQTLs). We found that dsQTLs are strongly enriched within inferred transcription factor binding sites and are frequently associated with allele-specific changes in transcription factor binding. A substantial fraction (16%) of dsQTLs are also associated with variation in the expression levels of nearby genes (that is, these loci are also classified as eQTLs). Conversely, we estimate that as many as 55% of eQTL single nucleotide polymorphisms are also dsQTLs. Our observations indicate that dsQTLs are highly abundant in the human genome and are likely to be important contributors to phenotypic variation."

The brassinosteroids were the last of the known major groups of plant hormones to be discovered, in 1979 (see http://go.nature.com/a6bryi ). Previously, steroid hormones had been identified only in animals and fungi. In this study, Zhi-Yong Wang and colleagues show that brassinosteroid negatively regulates stomatal development, thereby uncovering a mechanism by which a plant hormone coordinates development with elements of photosynthesis to promote optimal plant growth. Plants must coordinate the regulation of biochemistry and anatomy to optimize photosynthesis and water-use efficiency. The formation of stomata, epidermal pores that facilitate gas exchange, is highly coordinated with other aspects of photosynthetic development. The signalling pathways controlling stomata development are not fully understood1,2, although mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling is known to have key roles. Here we demonstrate in Arabidopsis that brassinosteroid regulates stomatal development by activating the MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) YDA (also known as YODA). Genetic analyses indicate that receptor kinase-mediated brassinosteroid signalling inhibits stomatal development through the glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-like kinase BIN2, and BIN2 acts upstream of YDA but downstream of the ERECTA family of receptor kinases. Complementary in vitro and in vivo assays show that BIN2 phosphorylates YDA to inhibit YDA phosphorylation of its substrate MKK4, and that activities of downstream MAPKs are reduced in brassinosteroid-deficient mutants but increased by treatment with either brassinosteroid or GSK3-kinase inhibitor. Our results indicate that brassinosteroid inhibits stomatal development by alleviating GSK3-mediated inhibition of this MAPK module, providing two key links; that of a plant MAPKKK to its upstream regulators and of brassinosteroid to a specific developmental output."
https://openalex.org/W2093636770,"Well-powered genome-wide association studies, now made possible through advances in technology and large-scale collaborative projects, promise to characterize the contribution of rare variants to complex traits and disease. However, while population structure is a known confounder of association studies, it remains unknown whether methods developed to control stratification are equally effective for rare variants. Here, we demonstrate that rare variants can show a stratification that is systematically different from, and typically stronger than, common variants, and this is not necessarily corrected by existing methods. We show that the same process leads to inflation for load-based tests and can obscure signals at truly associated variants. Furthermore, we show that populations can display spatial structure in rare variants, even when Wright's fixation index F(ST) is low, but that allele frequency-dependent metrics of allele sharing can reveal localized stratification. These results underscore the importance of collecting and integrating spatial information in the genetic analysis of complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W2152479330,"Hugh Markus, Peter Donnelly and colleagues report a genome-wide association study for ischemic stroke. They identify a SNP in HDAC9, a histone deacetylase gene, that is associated with large vessel ischemic stroke and suggest subtype-specific associations to ischemic stroke. Genetic factors have been implicated in stroke risk, but few replicated associations have been reported. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for ischemic stroke and its subtypes in 3,548 affected individuals and 5,972 controls, all of European ancestry. Replication of potential signals was performed in 5,859 affected individuals and 6,281 controls. We replicated previous associations for cardioembolic stroke near PITX2 and ZFHX3 and for large vessel stroke at a 9p21 locus. We identified a new association for large vessel stroke within HDAC9 (encoding histone deacetylase 9) on chromosome 7p21.1 (including further replication in an additional 735 affected individuals and 28,583 controls) (rs11984041; combined P = 1.87 × 10−11; odds ratio (OR) = 1.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.28–1.57). All four loci exhibited evidence for heterogeneity of effect across the stroke subtypes, with some and possibly all affecting risk for only one subtype. This suggests distinct genetic architectures for different stroke subtypes."
https://openalex.org/W1992104196,"Aging reduces the number of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that can differentiate into osteoblasts in the bone marrow, which leads to impairment of osteogenesis. However, if MSCs could be directed toward osteogenic differentiation, they could be a viable therapeutic option for bone regeneration. We have developed a method to direct MSCs to the bone surface by attaching a synthetic high-affinity and specific peptidomimetic ligand (LLP2A) against integrin α4β1 on the MSC surface to a bisphosphonate (alendronate, Ale) that has a high affinity for bone. LLP2A-Ale induced MSC migration and osteogenic differentiation in vitro. A single intravenous injection of LLP2A-Ale increased trabecular bone formation and bone mass in both xenotransplantation studies and in immunocompetent mice. Additionally, LLP2A-Ale prevented trabecular bone loss after peak bone acquisition was achieved or as a result of estrogen deficiency. These results provide proof of principle that LLP2A-Ale can direct MSCs to the bone to form new bone and increase bone strength."
https://openalex.org/W1970161481,"The ability to adapt to acute oxidative stress (e.g. H2O2, peroxynitrite, menadione, and paraquat) through transient alterations in gene expression is an important component of cellular defense mechanisms. We show that such adaptation includes Nrf2-dependent increases in cellular capacity to degrade oxidized proteins that are attributable to increased expression of the 20 S proteasome and the Pa28αβ (11 S) proteasome regulator. Increased cellular levels of Nrf2, translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and increased binding of Nrf2 to antioxidant response elements (AREs) or electrophile response elements (EpREs) in the 5′-untranslated region of the proteasome β5 subunit gene (demonstrated by chromatin immunoprecipitation (or ChIP) assay) are shown to be necessary requirements for increased proteasome/Pa28αβ levels, and for maximal increases in proteolytic capacity and stress resistance; Nrf2 siRNA and the Nrf2 inhibitor retinoic acid both block these adaptive changes and the Nrf2 inducers dl-sulforaphane, lipoic acid, and curcumin all replicate them without oxidant exposure. The immunoproteasome is also induced during oxidative stress adaptation, contributing to overall capacity to degrade oxidized proteins and stress resistance. Two of the three immunoproteasome subunit genes, however, contain no ARE/EpRE elements, and Nrf2 inducers, inhibitors, and siRNA all have minimal effects on immunoproteasome expression during adaptation to oxidative stress. Thus, immunoproteasome appears to be (at most) minimally regulated by the Nrf2 signal transduction pathway.

IntroductionDespite antioxidant defenses, such as superoxide dismutases and glutathione peroxidases, oxidative stress represents a constant danger to cell and organismal viability. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species can cause protein, lipid, sugar, DNA, and RNA modification. Oxidative modifications to proteins are common, and a major cellular defense strategy is to rapidly degrade mildly oxidized proteins before they can aggregate and cross-link to form insoluble cell inclusion bodies (1Davies K.J.

This is an adaptive process (sometimes called hormesis) in which cells treated with a mild dose of an oxidant will, for a period of time (≈24–48 h), become more resistant to a higher dose of the same (or related) oxidant that would normally be toxic. Recently, we have demonstrated that this adaptive response includes an increased abundance of 20 S proteasomes, immunoproteasomes, and Pa28αβ (or 11 S) proteasome regulators (26Pickering A.M.

As a product of this rapid turnover, newly translated Nrf2 is found predominantly in the cytoplasm. With Keap1 inactivation, as a product of factors such as oxidative stress, Nrf2 levels increase due to diminished proteasomal degradation, and Nrf2 is phosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus in mechanisms mediated by PKCδ and Akt (47Zhang H.

Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 binds to a cis-acting enhancer sequence, upstream of numerous antioxidant genes, known as the antioxidant response element (ARE) or electrophile responsive element (EpRE), and promotes the synthesis of several antioxidants, and enzymes responsible for repairing/removing oxidative damage and restoring cell viability (37Rushmore T.H.

Sci. 2001; 59: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar). Additionally, results by Kwak et al. (44Kwak M.K. Wakabayashi N. Greenlaw J.L. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Antioxidants enhance mammalian proteasome expression through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8786-8794Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) showed that the phenolic antioxidant [3H]1,2-dithiole-3-thione, which induces many cellular antioxidants and phase 2 enzymes, can also enhance mammalian proteasome expression through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway. These results led us to hypothesize that the transient stress adaptation, involving proteasome and proteasome regulators, which we described previously (26Pickering A.M. Koop A.L. Teoh C.Y. Ermak G. Grune T. Davies K.J. The immunoproteasome, the 20 S proteasome, and the PA28αβ proteasome regulator are oxidative-stress-adaptive proteolytic complexes.Biochem. J. 2010; 432: 585-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), might be primarily under the control of the Nrf2 transcription factor. In the present study we have, therefore, tested whether oxidative stress-induced increases in 20 S proteasome, immunoproteasome, and the Pa28αβ regulator, as well as increased stress resistance, are actually under the control of Nrf2, and whether Nrf2 is necessary and/or sufficient for their induction and for adaptation to various forms of oxidative stress.DISCUSSIONOur studies reveal a mechanistic link between Nrf2, the 20 S proteasome, the Pa28αβ (11 S) proteasome regulator, and transient adaptation to oxidative stress. It now appears clear that the Nrf2 signal transduction pathway plays a major role in both the increased proteasomal capacity to degrade oxidized proteins, and the increased cellular tolerance to oxidative stress that are induced by pretreatment with a mild dose of oxidant.We find that the cellular capacity to degrade oxidized proteins, and intracellular levels of the 20 S proteasome, immunoproteasome, and the Pa28αβ (11 S) regulator are all increased 2–3-fold during adaptation to oxidative stress. Similar results were obtained with the H2O2 and peroxynitrite oxidants, and the redox-cycling agents menadione and paraquat. Proteasome inhibitors, and siRNA directed against the 20 S proteasome β1 subunit, the immunoproteasome β1i (LMP2) subunit, or the Pa28α (11 S) regulator subunit, all significantly limit the increase in cellular proteolytic capacity and partially prevented the increased resistance to oxidative stress (cell growth).Cellular levels of Nrf2 were significantly increased by adaptation to oxidative stress, and Nrf2 was seen to translocate to the nucleus, and to bind to ARE/EpRE sequence(s) upstream of the proteasome β5 subunit gene. Blocking the induction of Nrf2, with siRNA or retinoic acid, significantly limited the adaptive increases in cellular proteolytic capacity, 20 S proteasome, and the Pa28αβ regulator. Increases in the immunoproteasome, however, were only partially blocked by Nrf2 siRNA. Blocking Nrf2 induction also limited the increase in oxidative stress resistance (cell growth). When, instead of using oxidant exposure, we pretreated cells with Nrf2 inducers lipoic acid, curcumin, or sulforaphane, we observed an increased cellular proteolytic capacity, increased 20 S proteasome, and increased cellular resistance to oxidative stress (cell growth); both Nrf2 siRNA and 20 S proteasome β1 subunit siRNA effectively blocked these increases.These results suggest that oxidants, redox cycling agents, and other Nrf2 inducers cause adaptation through the up-regulation of Nrf2 and its translocation to the nucleus. This, in turn, induces expression of the 20 S proteasome and the Pa28αβ regulator. In contrast, the immunoproteasome, whose levels were also increased by adaptation to oxidative stress, appears to be only partially regulated by Nrf2, if at all.The Nrf2 signal transduction pathway is known to respond to stressful conditions (37Rushmore T.H.

https://openalex.org/W2083893575,"Molecules associated with the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) superfamily, such as bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) and TGF-β, are key regulators of inflammation, apoptosis and cellular transitions. Here we show that the BMP receptor activin-like kinase 3 (Alk3) is elevated early in diseased kidneys after injury. We also found that its deletion in the tubular epithelium leads to enhanced TGF-β1-Smad family member 3 (Smad3) signaling, epithelial damage and fibrosis, suggesting a protective role for Alk3-mediated signaling in the kidney. A structure-function analysis of the BMP-Alk3-BMP receptor, type 2 (BMPR2) ligand-receptor complex, along with synthetic organic chemistry, led us to construct a library of small peptide agonists of BMP signaling that function through the Alk3 receptor. One such peptide agonist, THR-123, suppressed inflammation, apoptosis and the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program and reversed established fibrosis in five mouse models of acute and chronic renal injury. THR-123 acts specifically through Alk3 signaling, as mice with a targeted deletion for Alk3 in their tubular epithelium did not respond to therapy with THR-123. Combining THR-123 and the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor captopril had an additive therapeutic benefit in controlling renal fibrosis. Our studies show that BMP signaling agonists constitute a new line of therapeutic agents with potential utility in the clinic to induce regeneration, repair and reverse established fibrosis."

https://openalex.org/W2029000592,"The sequential synaptic integration of adult-born neurons has been widely examined in rodents, but the mechanisms regulating the integration remain largely unknown. The primary cilium, a microtubule-based signaling center, is essential for vertebrate development, including the development of the CNS. We examined the assembly and function of the primary cilium in the synaptic integration of adult-born mouse hippocampal neurons. Primary cilia were absent in young adult-born neurons, but assembled precisely at the stage when newborn neurons approach their final destination, further extend dendrites and form synapses with entorhinal cortical projections. Conditional deletion of cilia from adult-born neurons induced severe defects in dendritic refinement and synapse formation. Deletion of primary cilia led to enhanced Wnt and β-catenin signaling, which may account for these developmental defects. Taken together, our findings identify the assembly of primary cilia as a critical regulatory event in the dendritic refinement and synaptic integration of adult-born neurons."

To screen for epigenetically silenced miRNAs in prostate cancer (PCa), we treated prostate normal epithelial and carcinoma cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (AZA) and subsequently examined expression changes of 650 miRNAs by megaplex stemloop reverse transcription–quantitative PCR. After applying a selection strategy, we analyzed the methylation status of CpG islands upstream to a subset of miRNAs by methylation-specific PCR. The CpG islands of miR-18b, miR-132, miR-34b/c, miR-148a, miR-450a and miR-542-3p showed methylation patterns congruent with their expression modulations in response to AZA. Methylation analysis of these CpG islands in a panel of 50 human prostate carcinoma specimens and 24 normal controls revealed miR-132 to be methylated in 42% of human cancer cases in a manner positively correlated to total Gleason score and tumor stage. Expression analysis of miR-132 in our tissue panel confirmed its downregulation in methylated tumors. Re-expression of miR-132 in PC3 cells induced cell detachment followed by cell death (anoikis). Two pro-survival proteins—heparin-binding epidermal growth factor and TALIN2—were confirmed as direct targets of miR-132. The results of this study point to miR-132 as a methylation-silenced miRNA with an antimetastatic role in PCa controlling cellular adhesion."

Alcoholic fatty liver disease is clinically characterized by excess fat accumulation in the liver in response to ethanol consumption.

Six- to eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were divided into two dietary groups: (a) control low fat diet (fat comprising 10% of total calories and 72% of calories as carbohydrate) and (b) ethanol-containing low fat diet (identical to the control diet except with ethanol added to account for 29% of total calories and the caloric equivalent of carbohydrate (maltose-dextrin) removed). The animals were pair-fed for 4 weeks. The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of South Florida. We have reported previously the relevant hepatic histology and lipid data in these ethanol-fed mice.

Reverse transcription of total RNA to cDNA was performed using the High Capacity cDNA Archive kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) amplification was performed in an iCycler spectrofluorometric thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) using RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix and gene-specific primers (Table 1). The relative amount of target mRNA was calculated by the comparative cycle threshold (Ct) method by normalizing target mRNA Ct values to those for GAPDH.

Mouse AML-12 hepatocytes efficiently metabolize ethanol through class I (low Km) alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 proteins (19Hu M. Wang F. Li X. Rogers C.Q. Liang X. Finck B.N.

Regulation of hepatic lipin-1 by ethanol: Role of AMPK-activated protein kinase/sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 signaling in mice.Hepatology. 2012; 55: 437-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this cell line provides an adequate system in which to study how ethanol regulates several lipid metabolism signaling pathways (19Hu M. Wang F. Li X. Rogers C.Q. Liang X. Finck B.N. Mitra M.S. Zhang R. Mitchell D.A. You M.

Thus, we investigated miR-217 expression in AML-12 cells in response to ethanol exposure. As shown in Fig. 1A, ethanol dramatically increased the miR-217 levels in a concentration-dependent manner in AML-12 hepatocytes up to nearly 100-fold compared with controls. There were no significant changes in miR-33 or miR-34a levels in AML-12 cells exposed to ethanol, indicating that ethanol-induced miR-217 is specific (Fig. 1A). Ethanol, at 50 mm, generated optimal effects and was used in subsequent experiments. We used the alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole and the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 inhibitor cyanamide to determine whether ethanol metabolism was required for the ethanol-mediated miR-217 induction in AML-12 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, 4-methylpyrazole largely abolished the effect of ethanol on miR-217, whereas cyanamide augmented the ethanol effect. Collectively, these results suggest that acetaldehyde generated from ethanol may be, at least in part, responsible for the ability of ethanol to induce miR-217 in AML-12 hepatocytes. To determine whether the increased miR-217 levels induced by ethanol affect cellular TG accumulation, we examined the TG levels in AML-12 cells transfected with empty vector, miR-217, or a scrambled version of miR-217 (Sc-miR-217) with or without the presence of ethanol using Nile Red staining and enzymatic assays. Ethanol or overexpression of miR-217 significantly increased the TG accumulation in AML-12 cells compared with controls (Fig. 2). More importantly, miR-217 markedly augmented fat accumulation in AML-12 cells exposed to ethanol. These results were not seen when Sc-miR-217 was expressed. Our results clearly demonstrate that miR-217 promotes TG accumulation in AML-12 hepatocytes exposed to ethanol. We assessed whether the effects of ethanol observed in vitro also occurred in vivo by using liver samples from previously studied ethanol-fed and pair-fed control mice. Feeding mice ethanol (29% of the total calories) via a modified low fat Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet for 4 weeks led to development of liver steatosis and mildly elevated liver enzymes (5You M. Liang X. Ajmo J.M. Ness G.C. Involvement of mammalian sirtuin 1 in the action of ethanol in the liver.Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest.

Liver Physiol. 2010; 298: G364-G374Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The in vivo effect of ethanol on hepatic miR-217 was determined using cryo-preserved liver samples from those mice. Indeed, the level of miR-217 was drastically increased nearly 30-fold by ethanol feeding compared with the pair-fed controls (Fig. 3). The levels of hepatic miR-33 and miR-34a were slightly but significantly increased by ethanol feeding in mice (Fig. 3). MiR-217 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of SIRT1 in endothelial cells (20Menghini R. Casagrande V. Cardellini M. Martelli E. Terrinoni A. Amati F. Vasa-Nicotera M. Ippoliti A. Novelli G.

We used a reporter vector containing a luciferase gene followed by the 3′-UTR of human SIRT1 mRNA (SIRT1-3′-UTR) to explore the role of miR-217 in the regulation of SIRT1 in AML-12 cells. Overexpression of miR-217 significantly inhibited SIRT1-3′-UTR reporter activity in AML-12 cells (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, AML-12 cells transfected with miR-217 showed a significant reduction in SIRT1 mRNA and protein levels compared with controls (Figs. 4B and 5). SIRT1 deacetylase activity was also significantly diminished in AML-12 cells transfected with miR-217 compared with controls (Fig. 5D). Note that expression of Sc-miR-217 showed no significant effects on SIRT1.FIGURE 5miR-217 promotes ethanol-mediated inhibition of SIRT1 protein and activity in AML-12 hepatocytes. A, cell extracts of AML-12 cells transfected with plasmids of control vector, miR-217, or Sc-miR-217 with or without ethanol (50 mm) were immunoblotted with a SIRT1, p-AMPKα, AMPKα, or β-actin antibody.

Remarkably, expression of miR-217 significantly exacerbated the ethanol-mediated suppression of SIRT1 (FIGURE 4, FIGURE 5). SIRT1 regulates AMPK activity, and ethanol causes fat accumulation by inhibition of AMPK in hepatocytes (21You M. Matsumoto M. Pacold C.M. Cho W.K. Crabb D.W.

Thus, we further explored the role of miR-217 in regulating AMPK activity with or without ethanol in AML-12 cells. As shown in Fig. 5, A and C, miR-217 or ethanol substantially inhibited AMPK activity, demonstrated by a reduced p-AMPKα/AMPKα ratio in AML-12 cells, and ethanol-mediated AMPK inhibition was significantly augmented by miR-217 expression compared with Sc-miR-217 controls. Taken together, our data suggest that inhibition of SIRT1 by ethanol may be mediated, at least in part, through miR-217 induction in AML-12 hepatocytes. To verify the consequence of the miR-217-mediated inhibition of SIRT1, we transfected miR-217 into AML-12 cells and evaluated the mRNA expression levels of several known SIRT1-targeted enzymes involved in lipogenesis or fatty acid oxidation (2Ponugoti B.

As shown in Fig. 6A, overexpression of miR-217 significantly increased mRNA expression levels of several lipogenic enzymes (acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1 (SCD1)) compared with controls. Conversely, the mRNA expression levels of enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation (PPARα, PGC-1α, and acyl-CoA oxidase (AOX)) were significantly reduced in AML-12 cells transfected with miR-217 (Fig. 6B). Overexpression of Sc-miR-217 did not affect those enzymes. Collectively, our findings clearly suggest that miR-217 regulates genes encoding lipogenic or fatty acid oxidation enzymes in AML-12 cells. To further determine whether miR-217 is important in ethanol-mediated attenuation of SIRT1 signaling, we performed experiments inhibiting miR-217 in AML-12 cells using a miR-217 antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor (anti-miR-217). As shown in Fig. 7, reduction of miR-217 levels by transfection with anti-miR-217 significantly enhanced SIRT1 signaling in AML-12 cells. More importantly, anti-miR-217 restored SIRT1 signaling and largely prevented TG accumulation in AML-12 cells exposed to ethanol, suggesting a causal role of miR-217 in ethanol-mediated excess fat accumulation via down-regulation of SIRT1.

Integrin-linked kinase (ILK) is a focal adhesion adaptor and a serine/threonine protein kinase that regulates cell proliferation, survival and EMT. Elucidating the molecular mechanisms necessary for development and progression of human malignancies is critical to predict the most appropriate targets for cancer therapy. Here, we used transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFβ-1) to promote EMT and migration in mammary epithelial cells. We demonstrate a requirement of ILK activity for TGFβ-1-mediated EMT in mammary epithelial cells. In addition to nuclear translocation of Snail and Slug, TGFβ-1 treatment also induced expression of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2 component Rictor and its phosphorylation on Thr1135. Interestingly, TGFβ-1 treatment also induced an interaction between ILK and Rictor. All of these TGFβ-1-induced processes were significantly suppressed by inhibiting ILK activity or by disrupting the ILK/Rictor complex using small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown. Furthermore, we identified ILK/Rictor complex formation in cancer but not in normal cell types, and this was accompanied by ILK-dependent phosphorylation of Rictor on residue Thr1135. Inhibition of ILK partially reversed the basal mesenchymal phenotype of MDA-MB-231 cells and prevented EMT in MCF10A cells after TGFβ-1 treatment. These data demonstrate a requirement for ILK function in TGFβ-1-induced EMT in mammary epithelial cells and identify the ILK/Rictor complex as a potential molecular target for preventing/reversing EMT."

The acetylation of lysine 56 of histone H3 (H3K56ac) has been implicated in the control of nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair, and the yeast histone chaperone Rtt106 contributes to histone deposition during replication. Here, structural and biochemical experiments reveal how Rtt106 interacts with the H3–H4 dimer through a combinatorial recognition mechanism requiring the tandem PH domains of Rtt106. Acetylated H3K56 serves to enhance the affinity of the interaction, apparently by leading to increased flexibility of the H3 amino-terminus. Dynamic variations in the structure of chromatin influence virtually all DNA-related processes in eukaryotes and are controlled in part by post-translational modifications of histones1,2,3. One such modification, the acetylation of lysine 56 (H3K56ac) in the amino-terminal α-helix (αN) of histone H3, has been implicated in the regulation of nucleosome assembly during DNA replication and repair, and nucleosome disassembly during gene transcription4,5,6,7,8,9,10. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the histone chaperone Rtt106 contributes to the deposition of newly synthesized H3K56ac-carrying H3–H4 complex on replicating DNA5, but it is unclear how Rtt106 binds H3–H4 and specifically recognizes H3K56ac as there is no apparent acetylated lysine reader domain in Rtt106. Here, we show that two domains of Rtt106 are involved in a combinatorial recognition of H3–H4. An N-terminal domain homodimerizes and interacts with H3–H4 independently of acetylation while a double pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain binds the K56-containing region of H3. Affinity is markedly enhanced upon acetylation of K56, an effect that is probably due to increased conformational entropy of the αN helix of H3. Our data support a mode of interaction where the N-terminal homodimeric domain of Rtt106 intercalates between the two H3–H4 components of the (H3–H4)2 tetramer while two double PH domains in the Rtt106 dimer interact with each of the two H3K56ac sites in (H3–H4)2. We show that the Rtt106–(H3–H4)2 interaction is important for gene silencing and the DNA damage response."

This study determined the structure of P450 2D6 complexed with a substrate and potent inhibitor, prinomastat, to 2.85 Å resolution by x-ray crystallography. Prinomastat binding is well defined by electron density maps with its pyridyl nitrogen bound to the heme iron. The structure of ligand-bound P450 2D6 differs significantly from the ligand-free structure reported for the P450 2D6 Met-374 variant (Protein Data Bank code 2F9Q). Superposition of the structures reveals significant differences for β sheet 1, helices A, F, F', G"", G, and H as well as the helix B-C loop. The structure of the ligand complex exhibits a closed active site cavity that conforms closely to the shape of prinomastat. The closure of the open cavity seen for the 2F9Q structure reflects a change in the direction and pitch of helix F and introduction of a turn at Gly-218, which is followed by a well defined helix F' that was not observed in the 2F9Q structure. These differences reflect considerable structural flexibility that is likely to contribute to the catalytic versatility of P450 2D6, and this new structure provides an alternative model for in silico studies of substrate interactions with P450 2D6."
https://openalex.org/W2000508647,"DypB from Rhodococcus jostii RHA1 is a bacterial dye-decolorizing peroxidase (DyP) that oxidizes lignin and Mn(II). Three residues interact with the iron-bound solvent species in ferric DypB: Asn-246 and the conserved Asp-153 and Arg-244. Substitution of either Asp-153 or Asn-246 with alanine minimally affected the second order rate constant for Compound I formation (k(1) ∼ 10(5) M(-1)s(-1)) and the specificity constant (k(cat)/K(m)) for H(2)O(2). Even in the D153A/N246A double variant, these values were reduced less than 30-fold. However, these substitutions dramatically reduced the stability of Compound I (t(1/2) ∼ 0.13 s) as compared with the wild-type enzyme (540 s). By contrast, substitution of Arg-244 with leucine abolished the peroxidase activity, and heme iron of the variant showed a pH-dependent transition from high spin (pH 5) to low spin (pH 8.5). Two variants were designed to mimic the plant peroxidase active site: D153H, which was more than an order of magnitude less reactive with H(2)O(2), and N246H, which had no detectable peroxidase activity. X-ray crystallographic studies revealed that structural changes in the variants are confined to the distal heme environment. The data establish an essential role for Arg-244 in Compound I formation in DypB, possibly through charge stabilization and proton transfer. The principle roles of Asp-153 and Asn-246 appear to be in modulating the subsequent reactivity of Compound I. These results expand the range of residues known to catalyze Compound I formation in heme peroxidases."

Alleviating problems associated with cognitive impairment and finding the root of the disease remain priorities for clinicians and scientists. The incomplete understanding of the basis of this pathology has urged for research that will unravel the genetic origin of schizophrenia. But studies involving environmental exposure and social impact have also hinted at extrinsic factors as players in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, which may be exploited to prevent the development of the disease. In 'Bench to Bedside', Patrick Sullivan proposes a model putting forward how genetic variants may confer risk by functioning together within the same pathway. This disease pathway hypothesis would imply a polygenetic variation affecting the same pathway and the alteration of a transcriptional network as a root for increasing schizophrenia risk. In 'Bedside to Bench', Andreas Meyer-Linderberg and Heike Tost discuss human-based population studies that suggest that environmental factors linked to development of schizophrenia can affect brain regions involved in the human social-emotional processing network. Genetic risk variants for schizophrenia can also influence similar regions in the brain, suggesting that environmental and intrinsic factors may converge in the same neural circuit."
https://openalex.org/W2066275355,"The formation of a bipolar spindle is critical for accurate segregation of the genome. Maiato and colleagues now demonstrate that CLASPs (cytoplasmic linker associated proteins) prevent spindle multipolarity in a manner independent of end-on kinetochore–microtubule attachments. They propose that CENP-E-mediated traction forces are balanced by CLASP-mediated recruitment of ninein to centriolar satellites. Loss of spindle-pole integrity during mitosis leads to multipolarity independent of centrosome amplification1,2,3,4. Multipolar-spindle conformation favours incorrect kinetochore–microtubule attachments, compromising faithful chromosome segregation and daughter-cell viability5,6. Spindle-pole organization influences and is influenced by kinetochore activity7,8, but the molecular nature behind this critical force balance is unknown. CLASPs are microtubule-, kinetochore- and centrosome-associated proteins whose functional perturbation leads to three main spindle abnormalities: monopolarity, short spindles and multipolarity9,10,11,12,13. The first two reflect a role at the kinetochore–microtubule interface through interaction with specific kinetochore partners10,11,14, but how CLASPs prevent spindle multipolarity remains unclear. Here we found that human CLASPs ensure spindle-pole integrity after bipolarization in response to CENP-E- and Kid-mediated forces from misaligned chromosomes. This function is independent of end-on kinetochore–microtubule attachments and involves the recruitment of ninein to residual pericentriolar satellites. Distinctively, multipolarity arising through this mechanism often persists through anaphase. We propose that CLASPs and ninein confer spindle-pole resistance to traction forces exerted during chromosome congression, thereby preventing irreversible spindle multipolarity and aneuploidy."

Here we demonstrated a relevance for miR-9 in HL pathogenesis and identified two new targets Dicer1 and HuR. HL is characterized by a massive infiltration of immune cells and fibroblasts in the tumour, whereas malignant cells represent only 1% of the tumour mass. These infiltrates provide important survival and growth signals to the tumour cells, and several lines of evidence indicate that they are essential for the persistence of HL. We show that inhibition of miR-9 leads to derepression of DICER and HuR, which in turn results in a decrease in cytokine production by HL cells followed by an impaired ability to attract normal inflammatory cells. Finally, inhibition of miR-9 by a systemically delivered antimiR-9 in a xenograft model of HL increases the protein levels of HuR and DICER1 and results in decreased tumour outgrowth, confirming that miR-9 actively participates in HL pathogenesis and points to miR-9 as a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2001159673,"TRAIL (TNF (tumour necrosis factor)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) a putative anti-cancer cytokine induces apoptosis through DISC (death-inducing signalling complex)-mediated activation of caspase-8 and/or cleavage of Bid. TRAIL is relatively specific for tumour cells but primary chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells are resistant. Herein, we show that cellular metabolism influences cell death and that MCL cells (Z138 cell line) can survive/proliferate in glucose-free media by switching from aerobic glycolysis to ‘coupled’ oxidative phosphorylation. Extracellular flux analysis and mitochondrial inhibitors reveal that in the absence of glycolysis, Z138 cells have enhanced respiratory capacity coupled to ATP synthesis, similar to ‘classical’ state 3 mitochondria. Conversely, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) blocked glycolysis and partially inhibited glycolytic-dependent oxidative phosphorylation, resulting in a 50% reduction in cellular ATP levels. Also, 2DG sensitised Z138 cells to TRAIL and induced a marked decrease in caspase-8, -3, cFLIPS, Bid and Mcl-1 expression but Bak remained unchanged, altering the Mcl-1/Bak ratio, facilitating cytochrome c release and cell death. Conversely, under glucose-free conditions, Z138 cells were less sensitive to TRAIL with reduced TRAIL-R1/R2 surface receptor expression and impaired DISC formation. Anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and XIAP were up-regulated while pro-apoptotic BAX was down-regulated. Additionally, mitochondria had higher levels of cytochrome c and ultrastucturally exhibited a condensed configuration with enhanced intracristal spaces. Thus, metabolic switching was accompanied by mitochondrial proteome and ultrastructural remodelling enabling enhanced respiration activity. Cytochrome c release was decreased in glucose-free cells, suggesting that either pore formation was inhibited or that cytochrome c was more tightly bound. Glucose-free Z138 cells were also resistant to intrinsic cell death stimuli (ABT-737 and ionising radiation). In summary, in MCL cells, the anti-glycolytic effects of 2DG and glucose restriction produced opposite effects on TRAIL-induced cell death, demonstrating that mitochondrial metabolism directly modulates sensitivity of tumour cells to apoptosis."

By mass spectral analysis, a common set of ∼70 ligands was precipitated by HspB5 from plasma from patients with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and amyloidosis and mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. These proteins were distinguished from other precipitated molecules because they were enriched in the precipitate as compared with their plasma concentrations, and they exhibited temperature-dependent binding. More than half of these ligands were acute phase proteins or members of the complement or coagulation cascades. Consistent with this proposal, plasma levels of HspB5 were increased in patients with multiple sclerosis as compared with normal individuals. The combination of the thermal sensitivity of the HspB5 combined with the high local concentration of these ligands at the site of inflammation is proposed to explain the paradox of how a protein believed to exhibit nonspecific binding can bind with some relative apparent selectivity to proinflammatory proteins and thereby modulate inflammation.

https://openalex.org/W2071881888,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most frequent and aggressive primary brain tumors in adults. Uncontrolled proliferation and abnormal cell migration are two prominent spatially and temporally disassociated characteristics of GBMs. In this study, we investigated the role of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB2 in controlling the proliferation/migration dichotomy of GBM. We studied EphB2 gain of function and loss of function in glioblastoma-derived stem-like neurospheres, whose in vivo growth pattern closely replicates human GBM. EphB2 expression stimulated GBM neurosphere cell migration and invasion, and inhibited neurosphere cell proliferation in vitro. In parallel, EphB2 silencing increased tumor cell proliferation and decreased tumor cell migration. EphB2 was found to increase tumor cell invasion in vivo using an internally controlled dual-fluorescent xenograft model. Xenografts derived from EphB2-overexpressing GBM neurospheres also showed decreased cellular proliferation. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was found to be co-associated with and highly activated by EphB2 expression, and FAK activation facilitated focal adhesion formation, cytoskeleton structure change and cell migration in EphB2-expressing GBM neurosphere cells. Taken together, our findings indicate that EphB2 has pro-invasive and anti-proliferative actions in GBM stem-like neurospheres mediated, in part, by interactions between EphB2 receptors and FAK. These novel findings suggest that tumor cell invasion can be therapeutically targeted by inhibiting EphB2 signaling, and that optimal antitumor responses to EphB2 targeting may require concurrent use of anti-proliferative agents."

The universally conserved methyltransferase KsgA modifies two adjacent adenosine residues in the 3′-terminal helix 45 of the 16 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). KsgA recognizes its substrate adenosine residues only in the context of a near mature 30S subunit and is required for the efficient processing of the rRNA termini during ribosome biogenesis. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of KsgA bound to a nonmethylated 30S ribosomal subunit. The structure reveals that KsgA binds to the 30S platform with the catalytic N-terminal domain interacting with substrate adenosine residues in helix 45 and the C-terminal domain making extensive contacts to helix 27 and helix 24. KsgA excludes the penultimate rRNA helix 44 from adopting its position in the mature 30S subunit, blocking the formation of the decoding site and subunit joining.

The assembly of the small bacterial ribosomal subunit from its components, a large rRNA molecule and 21 proteins, is facilitated and controlled by ribosome biogenesis factors (1Woodson S.A. RNA folding and ribosome assembly.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2008; 12: 667-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Williamson J.R. Assembly of the 30S ribosomal subunit.Q. Rev. Biophys. 2005; 38: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The 16 S rRNA forms three domains, with a 5′ domain forming the body of the 30S, a central domain arranging into the platform, and a 3′ domain. The 3′ domain can be divided into a major domain that forms the head and a 3′-terminal minor domain that forms helix 45 and helix 44, which stretches down from the head across the long axis of the body (3Wimberly B.T.

Although the 30S ribosomal subunit can be assembled in vitro from its isolated components (4Mizushima S. Nomura M. Assembly mapping of 30S ribosomal proteins from E. coli.Nature. 1970; 2261214Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar), ribosome assembly in vivo is significantly faster and requires additional protein factors (5Williamson J.R.

Assembly of bacterial ribosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 501-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The in vivo ribosome assembly process is initiated by the transcription of a large precursor RNA containing all ribosomal RNA molecules, which is subsequently cleaved by several RNases to its mature length (7Kaczanowska M.

Maturation and degradation of ribosomal RNA in bacteria.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl. Sci. 2009; 85: 369-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In addition, the rRNA is modified at certain nucleotides (7Kaczanowska M. Rydén-Aulin M. Ribosome biogenesis and the translation process in Escherichia coli.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2007; 71: 477-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Although these modifications differ significantly when comparing ribosomes from different domains of life, the methylation of two adjacent adenosines at bases A1518 and A1519 in the small ribosomal subunit is universally conserved (9O'Farrell H.C. Pulicherla N. Desai P.M. Rife J.P. Recognition of a complex substrate by the KsgA/Dim1 family of enzymes has been conserved throughout evolution.RNA. 2006; 12: 725-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The methylation of these adenosine residues is catalyzed by the KsgA methyltransferase in Escherichia coli (10Helser T.L. Davies J.E. Dahlberg J.E.

KsgA methylates the loop nucleotides A1518 and A1519 of helix 45 located near the 3′ end of the 16 S rRNA. The absence of the methylations in strains deficient in methyltransferase activity confers resistance to the antibiotic kasugamycin (10Helser T.L. Davies J.E. Dahlberg J.E. Mechanism of kasugamycin resistance in Escherichia coli.Nat. New Biol. 1972; 235: 6-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In the eukaryotic 40 S ribosomal subunit, the corresponding adenosine bases are methylated by the homologous eukaryotic enzyme Dim1 (12Lafontaine D. Delcour J. Glasser A.L. Desgrès J. Vandenhaute J. The DIM1 gene responsible for the conserved m6(2)Am6(2)A dimethylation in the 3′-terminal loop of 18 S rRNA is essential in yeast.J. Mol.

Ribosome assembly factors prevent premature translation initiation by 40 S assembly intermediates.Science. 2011; 333: 1449-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The deletion of KsgA results in a cold-sensitive phenotype, implicating KsgA in the control of certain 30S ribosomal subunit assembly steps (14Connolly K. Rife J.P. Culver G. Mechanistic insight into the ribosome biogenesis functions of the ancient protein KsgA.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1062-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the KsgA deletion strain, a 17 S rRNA precursor accumulates, which is similar to the 17S rRNA species observed for the deletion or mutations of other ribosome biogenesis factors (14Connolly K. Rife J.P. Culver G. Mechanistic insight into the ribosome biogenesis functions of the ancient protein KsgA.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1062-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). These factors include the GTPases Era and RsgA, as well as the small assembly proteins RbfA and RimM, all of which are involved in late assembly steps (15Connolly K. Culver G. Deconstructing ribosome construction.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2009; 34: 256-263Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a mutant KsgA deficient in methyltransferase activity resulted in a large proportion of the 30S subunits being bound to KsgA in an immature state suggesting that the dissociation of KsgA following methylation precedes the end processing of the 17 S rRNA (14Connolly K. Rife J.P. Culver G. Mechanistic insight into the ribosome biogenesis functions of the ancient protein KsgA.Mol. Microbiol. 2008; 70: 1062-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). KsgA only modifies the rRNA in the context of a nearly mature 30S subunit. KsgA requires the presence of all (S6, S8, S11, S15, and S18) but one (S21) ribosomal proteins that collectively form the 30S platform, and three ribosomal proteins that are part of the 30S body (16Thammana P.

Autogenous regulation of the Escherichia coli ksgA gene at the level of translation.J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4002-4008Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More specifically, KsgA requires the 30S subunit to be in a translationally inactive conformation, which can be obtained in vitro by magnesium depletion (17Desai P.M. Rife J.P. The adenosine dimethyltransferase KsgA recognizes a specific conformational state of the 30S ribosomal subunit.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 449: 57-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The interaction sites of KsgA on the 30S subunit were mapped around the decoding site and the 30S platform using hydroxyl radical footprinting (19Xu Z. O'Farrell H.C. Rife J.P. Culver G.M.

The crystal structures share a high degree of structural similarity and can be divided into a C-terminal domain and an N-terminal catalytic domain. The N-terminal catalytic domain shares sequence and structural similarity to the adenine DNA methyltransferase (20O'Farrell H.C. Scarsdale J.N. Rife J.P.

Furthermore, two structures of the Aquifex aeolicus KsgA in complex with an RNA fragments of helix 45 were solved (24Tu C. Tropea J.E. Austin B.P. Court D.L. Waugh D.S. Ji X.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 10156-10161Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These structures show catalytically inactive complexes and are inconsistent with structural model based on footprinting data (19Xu Z. O'Farrell H.C. Rife J.P. Culver G.M. A conserved rRNA methyltransferase regulates ribosome biogenesis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 534-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Other structural data on this system include the x-ray crystal structure of a 30S ribosomal subunit lacking the methylations on A1518 and A1519 (26Demirci H. Murphy 4th, F. Belardinelli R. Kelley A.C. Ramakrishnan V. Gregory S.T. Dahlberg A.E. Jogl G. Modification of 16 S ribosomal RNA by the KsgA methyltransferase restructures the 30S subunit to optimize ribosome function.RNA. 2010; 16: 2319-2324Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, this structure was obtained under high magnesium conditions under which the subunit cannot be modified by KsgA. To investigate the complex substrate specificity of KsgA, we determined the structure of KsgA in complex with a substrate 30S subunit by cryo-electron microscopy. The structure reveals that KsgA recognizes the 30S in a particular translationally inactive conformation. The dissociation of KsgA is required for formation of the translationally active 30S subunit conformation. We suggest that a similar conformational change occurs in the last steps of the small ribosomal subunit biogenesis. KsgA was expressed and purified as described previously (27O'Farrell H.C. Musayev F.N. Scarsdale J.N. Wright H.T. Rife J.P.

A conserved rRNA methyltransferase regulates ribosome biogenesis.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Biol. 1986; 191: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The purified submethylated 30S subunits were resuspended in buffer K (40 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.6, 6 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) and stored at −80 °C (19Xu Z. O'Farrell H.C. Rife J.P. Culver G.M. A conserved rRNA methyltransferase regulates ribosome biogenesis.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 534-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). For complex formation, 100 nm 30S subunits and a 20-fold molar excess of KsgA were incubated in buffer K for 37 °C for 10 min and placed on ice for 10 min. For the control, translationally inactive 30S subunits were purified from a ksgA deletion strain JW0050-3 obtained from the E. coli Genetic Resource Center at Yale University (29Baba T. Ara T.

For the reactivation of the inactivated subunits, the magnesium concentration was increased to 20 mm, and the sample was incubated at 40 °C for 20 min (28Moazed D. Van Stolk B.J. Douthwaite S. Noller H.F. Interconversion of active and inactive 30S ribosomal subunits is accompanied by a conformational change in the decoding region of 16 S rRNA.J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 191: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 5 μl of the KsgA-30Si complex or the control 30Si ribosomal subunit samples were applied to a holey carbon copper grid (Quantifoil, Jena, Germany) and plunged into liquid ethane (30Dubochet J. Adrian M. Chang J.J. Homo J.C. Lepault J. McDowall A.W. Schultz P. Cryo-electron microscopy of vitrified specimens.Q. Rev. Biophys. 1988; 21: 129-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1765) Google Scholar). The grids were imaged in a Tecnai F20 electron microscope (FEI, Hillsboro, OR) operated at 200 kV at a magnification of 82,000-fold. Images were acquired on an UltraScan 4000 CCD camera (Gatan, Pleasanton, CA) under low dose conditions at a 2–4-μm defocus. Carbon foil holes showing sufficiently thin ice were selected manually, and image series of 2 × 2 images were collected semi-automatically in each hole using a SerialEM script (31Mastronarde D.N. Automated electron microscope tomography using robust prediction of specimen movements.J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 152: 36-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (2499) Google Scholar). In addition to controlling the spot scan, the script monitors specimen drift and sets the desired defocus. The exact defocus of each image was subsequently determined using the Ctffind3 program (32Mindell J.A. Grigorieff N. Accurate determination of local defocus and specimen tilt in electron microscopy.J. Struct. Biol. 2003; 142: 334-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Single particle images were windowed out semi-automatically with Boxer (33Ludtke S.J. Baldwin P.R. Chiu W. EMAN: semiautomated software for high resolution single-particle reconstructions.J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 128: 82-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (2101) Google Scholar). For the single particle datasets, ctf correction was applied using Spider (34Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y.

Initial three-dimensional reconstructions were obtained using the Imagic 5 software with a down-filtered 30S subunit as initial reference, which was obtained from 70 S structure (35van Heel M.

In the last rounds of refinement, amplitude correction was applied to the reconstruction by Fourier filtering using B factors (37Fernández J.J. Luque D. Castón J.R. Carrascosa J.L.

For the reconstruction of the KsgA-30Si complex, the initial dataset was split into more homogeneous subpopulations using a bootstrap three-dimensional variance analysis and classification approach (38Penczek P.A.

The aligned single particles were sorted by projection direction, and from each projection direction, particles were chosen randomly with replacement. From each random sample of particles, a three-dimensional structure was calculated. Three-dimensional multivariate statistical analysis of the resulting three-dimensional structures gave eigen volumes corresponding to the main structural differences in the particle population using the Imagic5 software (35van Heel M. Harauz G. Orlova E.V. Schmidt R. Schatz M. A new generation of the IMAGIC image processing system.J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (1049) Google Scholar). Based on the second eigen volume, the single particle image set was split into more homogeneous subgroups. The second eigen volume was projected in each projection direction, and factorial coordinates were calculated for each single particle image (40Spahn C.M. Penczek P.A. Exploring conformational modes of macromolecular assemblies by multiparticle cryo-EM.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The single particle images were sorted according to the factorial coordinates, and three-dimensional structures were calculated. The resulting structures were refined in a multiparticle refinement approach in Spider (41Loerke J. Giesebrecht J. Spahn C.M.

The number of particles used and the resolution of the final reconstructions are shown in supplemental Table S1. Structural figures were prepared with Chimera (42Pettersen E.F. Goddard T.D.

Macroscopic models of aqueous solutions: biological and chemical applications.J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 1101-1109Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar). We studied the complex of KsgA with 30S ribosomal subunits lacking the methylations at A1518 and A1519 by electron microscopy. Mature 30S ribosomal subunits were isolated and brought into the inactive conformation recognized by KsgA, hereafter named 30Si, by magnesium depletion as described previously (19Xu Z. O'Farrell H.C.

Biol. 1986; 191: 483-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Initial reconstructions of the KsgA-30Si complex could not be refined to high resolution (supplemental Fig. 1), indicating significant conformational heterogeneity of the 30Si subunit. The reconstruction showed no significant density for helix 44 of the 16 S rRNA. To investigate the structural heterogeneity and refine the reconstructions to higher resolution, we employed a bootstrap variance analysis and three-dimensional classification technique (38Penczek P.A.

Structure of the 30S translation initiation complex.Nature. 2008; 455: 416-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Based on the variance analysis, the dataset can then be split into subgroups of particles (40Spahn C.M. Penczek P.A. Exploring conformational modes of macromolecular assemblies by multiparticle cryo-EM.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2009; 19: 623-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and from these subgroups three-dimensional reconstructions showing the main conformational states can be reconstructed. These reconstructions can then be refined in a multiparticle alignment approach (41Loerke J. Giesebrecht J. Spahn C.M. Multiparticle cryo-EM of ribosomes.Methods Enzymol. 2010; 483: 161-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) to refine conformational substates to higher resolution. Using this approach, four subgroups of particles showing different positions of the head relative to the body of the 30Si subunit were obtained (supplemental Fig. 2). Further refinement of these four subgroups significantly improved the resolution of the group 1 and 4 reconstructions (Fig. 1 and supplemental Fig. 3). The resolution of these reconstructions is 12.3 and 13.5 Å for classes 1 and 4, respectively (0.5 criterion) (supplemental Table 1). In addition, we obtained the structure of the 30Si ribosomal subunit in the absence of KsgA at 15.5 Å resolution (0.5 criterion) (supplemental Table 1). The structures were interpreted by fitting the crystal structure of the E. coli small ribosomal subunit (44Schuwirth B.S. Borovinskaya M.A. Hau C.W. Zhang W. Vila-Sanjurjo A. Holton J.M. Cate J.H. Structures of the bacterial ribosome at 3.5 Å resolution.Science. 2005; 310: 827-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (1090) Google Scholar) into the densities (Fig. 1). As the relative orientations of the head and body vary for the KsgA-30Si reconstructions, we independently fitted the head and body as rigid bodies. In class 1 of the KsgA-30Si complexes, the head density is very weak and could not be fitted with the crystal structure (supplemental Fig. 3, class 1). Helix 44 is not visible in any of the 30Si reconstructions (Fig. 1, A and B), indicating that this RNA helix is flexibly linked to the 30Si structure. In addition, we obtained a structure of a reactivated 30Si ribosomal subunit mimicking the formation of the mature 30S subunit after KsgA-mediated methylation (Fig. 1C). We reactivated the 30Si ribosomal subunit by incubation in a high magnesium buffer at 40 °C. In the three-dimensional reconstruction, we observe a well defined density for helix 44 in a conformation similar to the crystal structure of translationally active 30S subunits, confirming the structural integrity of our 30Si preparation (3Wimberly B.T. Brodersen D.E. Clemons Jr., W.M. Morgan-Warren R.J. Carter A.P. Vonrhein C. Hartsch T. Ramakrishnan V.

Thus, the absence of a helix 44 density in the reconstructions of the inactive 30Si ribosomal subunit is due to a conformational change of helix 44 upon inactivation. Comparing the structure of the inactive apo-30Si with the structure of the KsgA-30Si complex revealed extra density at the platform of the 30Si in the KsgA complex (Fig. 1, A and B). Using the fitted 30Si structure, we separated this extra density from the 30Si subunit structure (Fig. 1B). The density has an elongated shape and is slightly bent with a broader part near the decoding site and a narrower tail. These features allow unambiguous fitting of the crystal structure of KsgA into the density (correlation coefficient 0.87) (20O'Farrell H.C. Scarsdale J.N. Rife J.P. Crystal structure of KsgA, a universally conserved rRNA adenine dimethyltransferase in Escherichia coli.J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 337-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The location of KsgA on the intersubunit side of 30Si ribosomal subunit would prevent subunit joining and 70 S formation by a steric clash with helix 69 of the large ribosomal subunit. KsgA is bound to the platform at helices 24, 27, and 45 (Fig. 2, A–C). The catalytic N-terminal domain of KsgA contacts the loop of helix 45, which brings A1518 and A1519 close to the active site of KsgA. The substrate adenosine residues A1518 and A1519 are located at the entry of the negatively charged catalytic center of KsgA, which binds the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine. The substrate adenosines would have to shift by about 7 Å in a flipped out conformation to reach the active site of KsgA, possibly accompanied by a slight conformational rearrangement of the helix 45 loop (Fig. 2C). Such a substrate binding mode can be compared with the structure of DNA methyltransferases in complex with their substrate. The DNA methyltransferase M.TaqI in complex with its substrate DNA shows a flipped out base reaching into the catalytic center of M.TaqI (Fig. 2D) (45Goedecke K. Pignot M. Goody R.S. Scheidig A.J.

The C-terminal domain of KsgA binds to the ribosome exclusively by contacting rRNA, specifically 16 S rRNA helices 27 and 24. The electrostatic surface potential of KsgA shows a large positively charged region on the C-terminal domain and in the cleft formed by the N- and C-terminal domains fa"
https://openalex.org/W2040807402,"TAL1/SCL is a hematopoietic-specific oncogene and its activity is regulated by associated transcriptional co-activators and corepressors. Dysregulation of TAL1 activity has been associated with T-cell leukemogenesis. However, it remains unclear how the interactions between TAL1 and corepressors versus co-activators are properly regulated. Here, we reported that protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation regulates TAL1 interaction with the lysine-specific demethylase (LSD1) that removes methyl group from methylated Lys 4 on histone H3 tails. Phosphorylation of serine 172 in TAL1 specifically destabilizes the TAL1–LSD1 interaction leading to promoter H3K4 hypermethylation and activation of target genes that have been suppressed in normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Knockdown of TAL1 or LSD1 led to a derepression of the TAL1 target genes in T-cell acute lymphoblast leukemia (T-ALL) Jurkat cells, which is accompanied by elevating promoter H3K4 methylation. Similarly, treatment of PKA activator forskolin resulted in derepression of target genes by reducing its interaction with LSD1 while PKA inhibitor H89 represses them by suppressing H3K4 methylation levels. Consistent with the dual roles of TAL1 in transcription, TAL1-associated LSD1 is decreased while recruitment of hSET1 is increased at the TAL1 targets during erythroid differentiation. This process is accompanied by a dramatic increase in H3K4 methylation. Thus, our data revealed a novel interplay between PKA phosphorylation and TAL1-mediated epigenetic regulation that regulates hematopoietic transcription and differentiation programs during hematopoiesis and leukemogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2110217188,"The RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway is deregulated in over 90% of malignant melanomas, and targeting MEK as a central kinase of this pathway is currently tested in clinical trials. However, dose-limiting side effects are observed, and MEK inhibitors that sufficiently reduce ERK activation in patients show a low clinical response. Apart from dose limitations, a reason for the low response to MEK targeting drugs is thought to be the upregulation of counteracting signalling cascades as a direct response to MEK inhibition. Therefore, understanding the biology of melanoma cells and the effects of MEK inhibition on these cells will help to identify new combinatorial approaches that are more potent and allow for lower concentrations of the drug being used. We have discovered that in melanoma cells MEK inhibition by selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) or PD184352, while efficiently suppressing proliferation, stimulates increased invasiveness. Inhibition of MEK suppresses actin-cortex contraction and increases integrin-mediated adhesion. Most importantly, and surprisingly, MEK inhibition results in a significant increase in matrix metalloproteases (MMP)-2 and membrane-type 1-MMP expression. All together, MEK inhibition in melanoma cells induces a 'mesenchymal' phenotype that is characterised by protease-driven invasion. This mode of invasion is dependent on integrin-mediated adhesion, and because SRC kinases are the main regulators of this process, the SRC kinase inhibitor, saracatinib (AZD0530), completely abolished the MEK inhibitor-induced invasion. Moreover, the combination of saracatinib and selumetinib effectively suppressed the growth and invasion of melanoma cells in a 3D environment, suggesting that combined inhibition of MEK and SRC is a promising approach to improve the efficacy of targeting the ERK/MAP kinase pathway in melanoma."
https://openalex.org/W1964144897,"The β3 subunit of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 integrins contains four epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains. Each domain harbors four disulfide bonds of which one is unique for integrins. We previously discerned a regulatory role of the EGF-4 Cys-560-Cys-583 unique bond for αIIbβ3 activation. In this study we further investigated the role of all four integrin unique bonds in both αIIbβ3 and αvβ3. We created β3 mutants harboring serine substitutions of each or both cysteines that disrupt the four unique bonds (Cys-437-Cys-457 in EGF-1, Cys-473-Cys-503 in EGF-2, Cys-523-Cys-544 in EGF-3, and Cys-560-Cys-583 in EGF-4) and transfected them into baby hamster kidney cells together with normal αv or αIIb. Flow cytometry was used to measure surface expression of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 and their activity state by soluble fibrinogen binding. Most cysteine substitutions caused similarly reduced surface expression of both receptors. Disrupting all four unique disulfide bonds by single cysteine substitutions resulted in variable constitutive activation of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3. In contrast, whereas double C437S/C457S and C473S/C503S mutations yielded constitutively active αIIbβ3 and αvβ3, the C560S/C583S mutation did not, and the C523S/C544S mutation only yielded constitutively active αIIbβ3. Activation of C523S/C544S αvβ3 mutant by activating antibody and dithiothreitol was also impaired. Molecular dynamics of C523S/C544S β3 in αIIbβ3 but not in αvβ3 displayed an altered stable conformation. Our findings indicate that unique disulfide bonds in β3 differently affect the function of αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 and suggest a free sulfhydryl-dependent regulatory role for Cys-560-Cys-583 in both αIIbβ3 and αvβ3 and for Cys-523-Cys-544 only in αvβ3."
https://openalex.org/W2064228418,"Some colon cancer (CC) patients present synchronous cancers at diagnosis and others develop metachronous neoplasms, but the risk factors are unclear for non-hereditary CC. We showed previously that global DNA demethylation increased with aging and correlated with genomic damage in CC, and we show now that preferentially associates to CCs with wild-type p53. This study aimed to elucidate the extent of DNA hypomethylation in patients with single and multiple CC, its relationship with aging, and its potential as predictive tool. We compared by real-time methylation-specific PCR the relative demethylation level (RDL) of long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (LINE-1) sequences in matched cancer tissues and non-cancerous colonic mucosa (NCM) from patients with single and multiple right-sided CCs. Although no RDL difference was found in NCM from single CC patients and healthy volunteers (P=0.5), there was more demethylation (higher RDL) in NCM from synchronous cancer patients (P=1.1 × 10(-5)) multiple CCs also were more demethylated than single CCs (P=0.0014). High NCM demethylation was predictive for metachronous neoplasms (P=0.003). In multivariate logistic regression analyses RDL was the only independent predictor for metachronous (P=0.02) and multiple (P=4.9 × 10(-5)) tumors. The higher LINE-1 demethylation in NCM from patients with multiple (synchronous and metachronous) tumors (P=9.6 × 10(-7)) was also very significant in patients with tumors without (P=3.8 × 10(-6)), but not with (P=0.16) microsatellite instability. NCM demethylation increased with aging in patients with single tumors, but decreased in those with multiple tumors. Moreover, the demethylation difference between patients with single vs multiple tumors appeared higher in younger (P=3.6 × 10(-4)) than in older (P=0.0016) patients. These results predict that LINE-1 hypomethylation in NCM can be used as an epigenetic predictive biomarker for multiple CC risk. The stronger association of demethylation in NCM with multiple CC risk from younger patients also suggests an inherited predisposition for the apparent field cancerization effect of somatic demethylation."

Cleaved intracellular domain of ErbB4 directly interacted with HIF-1α in the nucleus, and stabilized HIF-1α protein in both normoxic and hypoxic conditions by blocking its proteasomal degradation. The mechanism of HIF stabilization was independent of VHL and proline hydroxylation but dependent on RACK1. ErbB4 activity was necessary for efficient HRE-driven promoter activity, transcription of known HIF-1α target genes, and survival of mammary carcinoma cells in vitro. In addition, mammary epithelial specific targeting of Erbb4 in the mouse significantly reduced the amount of HIF-1α protein in vivo. ERBB4 expression also correlated with the expression of HIF-regulated genes in a series of 4552 human normal and cancer tissue samples.

As a consequence we have proposed BAG3 as a target of antineoplastic therapies. Here we identify a novel role for BAG3 in regulation of neo-angiogenesis and show that its downregulation results in reduced angiogenesis therefore expanding the role of BAG3 as a therapeutical target. In brief we show that BAG3 is expressed in endothelial cells and is essential for the interaction between ERK and its phosphatase DUSP6, as a consequence its removal results in reduced binding of DUSP6 to ERK and sustained ERK phosphorylation that in turn determines increased levels of p21 and p15 and cell-cycle arrest in the G1 phase."

The lens epithelium-derived growth factor (LEDGF/p75), an IN interacting cellular cofactor, has been shown to play an important role in HIV-1 chromatin targeting and integration. However, whether other cellular cofactors are also involved in viral replication steps is still elusive. Here, we show that nucleoporin 62 (Nup62) is a chromatin-bound protein and can specifically interact with HIV-1 IN in both soluble nuclear extract and chromatin-bound fractions. The knockdown of Nup62 by shRNA reduced the association of IN with host chromatin and significantly impaired viral integration and replication in HIV-1-susceptible cells. Furthermore, the expression of the IN-binding region of Nup62 in CD4(+) T cells significantly inhibited HIV-1 infection. Taken together, these results indicate that the cellular Nup62 is specifically recruited by HIV-1 IN and contribute to an efficient viral DNA integration."
https://openalex.org/W2162965006,"Adolescence is a critical developmental period during which most adult smokers initiate their habit. Adolescents are more vulnerable than adults to nicotine's long-term effects on addictive and cognitive behavior. We investigated whether adolescent nicotine exposure in rats modifies expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the short and/or long term, and whether this has functional consequences. Using receptor binding studies followed by immunoprecipitation of nAChR subunits, we showed that adolescent nicotine exposure, as compared with saline, caused an increase in mPFC nAChRs containing α4 or β2 subunits (24 and 18%, respectively) 24 h after the last injection. Nicotine exposure in adulthood had no such effect. This increase was transient and was not observed 5 wk following either adolescent or adult nicotine exposure. In line with increased nAChRs expression 1 d after adolescent nicotine exposure, we observed a 34% increase in amplitude of nicotine-induced spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents in layer II/III mPFC pyramidal neurons. These effects were transient and specific, and observed only acutely after adolescent nicotine exposure, but not after 5 wk, and no changes were observed in adult-exposed animals. The acute nicotine-induced increase in α4β2-containing receptors in adolescents interferes with the normal developmental decrease (37%) of these receptors from early adolescence (postnatal day 34) to adulthood (postnatal day 104) in the mPFC. Together, this suggests that these receptors play a role in mediating the acute rewarding effects of nicotine and may underlie the increased sensitivity of adolescents to nicotine.—Counotte, D.

Recent discovery revealed mutations of proto-oncogenic CBL in the linker region and RING finger domain in human acute myeloid neoplasm, and these transforming mutations induced carcinogenesis. However, the adaptor function of CBL mediated signaling pathway during tumorigenesis has not been well characterized. Here, we show that CBL is highly expressed in breast cancer cells and significantly inhibits transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) tumor suppressive activity. Knockdown of CBL expression resulted in the increased expression of TGF-β target genes, PAI-I and CDK inhibitors such as p15INK4b and p21Cip1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CBL is frequently overexpressed in human breast cancer tissues, and the loss of CBL decreases the tumorigenic activity of breast cancer cells in vivo. CBL directly binds to Smad3 through its proline-rich motif, thereby preventing Smad3 from interacting with Smad4 and blocking nuclear translocation of Smad3. CBL-b, one of CBL protein family, also interacted with Smad3 and knockdown of both CBL and CBL-b further enhanced TGF-β transcriptional activity. Our findings provide evidence for a previously undescribed mechanism by which oncogenic CBL can block TGF-β tumor suppressor activity."

The maintenance of the integrity of Skp2 SCF complex is critical for its E3 ligase activity. The Skp2 F-box protein is a rate-limiting step and key factor in this complex, which binds to its protein substrates and triggers ubiquitination and degradation of its substrates. Skp2 is found to be overexpressed in numerous human cancers, which has an important role in tumorigenesis. The molecular mechanism by which the function of Skp2 and Skp2 SCF complex is regulated remains largely unknown. Here we show that Foxo3a transcription factor is a novel and negative regulator of Skp2 SCF complex. Foxo3a is found to be a transcriptional repressor of Skp2 gene expression by directly binding to the Skp2 promoter, thereby inhibiting Skp2 protein expression. Surprisingly, we found for the first time that Foxo3a also displays a transcription-independent activity by directly interacting with Skp2 and disrupting Skp2 SCF complex formation, in turn inhibiting Skp2 SCF E3 ligase activity and promoting p27 stability. Finally, we show that the oncogenic activity of Skp2 is repressed by Foxo3a overexpression. Our results not only reveal novel insights into how Skp2 SCF complex is regulated, but also establish a new role for Foxo3a in tumor suppression through a transcription-dependent and independent manner."

They unravel a novel pathway for cell adaptation to hypoxia that could have pathophysiologic relevance in tissue ischemia and cancer. IntroductionCell adaptation to reduced oxygen availability to maintain ATP levels is a major physiologic challenge because O2 deprivation, even transient, can produce irreversible damage. Cellular responses to hypoxia comprise transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms, the nature of which is as yet only partially known (1.Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ratcliffe P.J.

Cellular levels of HIF-α are inversely correlated with the activity of prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), O2-sensing and Fe2+-dependent enzymes that hydroxylate specific proline residues in HIF-α using O2 as co-substrate, thus allowing HIF-α ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (4.Epstein A.C.

Nevertheless, they are essential for cell survival during the first minutes of hypoxia, before functional expression of the O2-regulated genes can take place (2.Lopez-Barneo J. Pardal R.

Global inhibition of protein synthesis (“translational arrest”) has been classically recognized as a fundamental adaptation to hypoxia because mRNA translation is an energy-costly process that consumes up to 70% of the ATP synthesized by the cells. Hence, any small adjustment to the translation rate can spare sufficient ATP as to immediately attend functions critical for cell survival (7.Arsham A.M. Howell J.J. Simon M.C.

In this regard, eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), a translocase necessary for the movement of the mRNA along the ribosome, is particularly important as, in conjunction with aminoacylation, it uses most of the ATP required for protein synthesis (15.Proud C.G. Signaling to translation: how signal transduction pathways control the protein synthetic machinery.Biochem.

Among these proteins, eEF2 was also modulated by dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG), an inhibitor of the O2-sensing PHDs. Herein, we show that eEF2 activity is rapidly and reversibly regulated by O2 tension in a PHD2-dependent manner. This phenomenon is unrelated to HIF stabilization, and it occurs prior to AMPK activation. These observations, which unveil unexpected actions of the O2-sensing PHD2, could have profound implications for the pathophysiology and pharmacology of cell adaptation to hypoxia.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture and Hypoxic TreatmentsPC12, Mlp9, HeLa, and HuH7 cells were cultured in DMEM (BioWhittaker) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm l-glutamine (BioWhittaker). Cardiac ventricular myocytes were prepared from 1–3-day-old animals and cultured as described (19.Akao M. Ohler A. O'Rourke B. Marbán E.

Cells were maintained under a water-saturated atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. DMOG (BIOMOL International) was used at a final concentration of 1 mm, NaF (Sigma) was used at 25 mm, and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide riboside (Sigma) was used at 1 mm. Okadaic acid (Calbiochem) and sanguinarine (Sigma) were used at the concentrations specified.Hypoxic conditions (1% O2, 94% N2, and 5% CO2) were achieved in a humidified variable aerobic workstation (Invivo2 300, Ruskinn Technology Ltd.). In all experiments, cells were plated at 30–50% confluence to prevent the development of anaerobic conditions at 1% O2.

We focused on eEF2, a translocase necessary for protein synthesis, although we identified two other proteins (arginyl aminopeptidase and protease inhibitor SerpinB6) also altered by lowering O2 tension (supplemental Table I). We have shown that hypoxic inhibitory eEF2 phosphorylation is independent of AMPK activity and is mimicked by DMOG treatment, thus suggesting that eEF2 activity and protein synthesis are modulated by PHDs.Translational arrest is a classically studied cellular response to anoxia or long-term hypoxia (for a review, see Ref. 14.Koritzinsky M. Wouters B.G. Hypoxia and regulation of messenger RNA translation.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 435: 247-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that a short (2 h) exposure to moderate hypoxia (0.2–2% O2) can lead to a modest but reproducible decrease in translation efficiency (35.Koritzinsky M. Rouschop K.M. van den Beucken T. Magagnin M.G. Savelkouls K. Lambin P. Wouters B.G.

We have shown here that acute (5–15 min) hypoxia (1% O2) or DMOG treatment leads to changes in the eEF2 migration pattern as a consequence of increased protein phosphorylation at Thr56. It is well established that phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr56 decreases the rate of protein elongation (16.Nairn A.C. Palfrey H.C.

Similar results have been reported using tumor/immortalized cell lines (12.Connolly E. Braunstein S. Formenti S. Schneider R.J. Hypoxia inhibits protein synthesis through a 4E-BP1 and elongation factor 2 kinase pathway controlled by mTOR and uncoupled in breast cancer cells.Mol. Cell.

Cell. 2006; 21: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar), but longer periods, more severe hypoxia, or even concomitant serum withdrawal was required to observe a decrease in protein synthesis in these cellular models that are normally resistant to mRNA translation inhibition by hypoxia (30.Höckel M. Vaupel P. Tumor hypoxia: definitions and current clinical, biologic, and molecular aspects.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2001; 93: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2130) Google Scholar).The activation of the AMPK-eEF2K-eEF2 pathway to arrest protein translation under long-term hypoxia or ischemia has been elegantly demonstrated in previous reports (12.Connolly E. Braunstein S. Formenti S. Schneider R.J. Hypoxia inhibits protein synthesis through a 4E-BP1 and elongation factor 2 kinase pathway controlled by mTOR and uncoupled in breast cancer cells.Mol. Cell.

Hypoxia-induced energy stress regulates mRNA translation and cell growth.Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 521-531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). However, the inhibition of eEF2 activity observed under acute hypoxia described here is independent of this pathway. Indeed, we have shown that short-term hypoxia even decreases AMPK activity in all cells tested (Fig. 2, A and B). In agreement with these data, cellular ATP levels were preserved or increased upon acute exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 2C) (13.Liu L. Cash T.P. Jones R.G. Keith B. Thompson C.B. Simon M.C.

The existence of complementary PHD2- and AMPK-dependent eEF2 modulator pathways set in motion depending on O2 availability is advantageous because it offers a broader adaptive repertoire to ensure ATP homeostasis.As DMOG inhibits a broad family (>50 members) of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (4.Epstein A.C.

Targeting of HIF-α to the von Hippel-Lindau ubiquitylation complex by O2-regulated prolyl hydroxylation.Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4369) Google Scholar), we performed siRNA analyses to identify the PHDs involved in eEF2 regulation. We found that selective inhibition of PHD2 in several cell lines leads to sustained eEF2 phosphorylation at Thr56, thus confirming that protein synthesis is modulated by the activity of the O2 sensor PHD2 (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. 2A). To achieve a strong silencing of PHD2, cells were treated with siRNAs for 72 h, inducing several HIF-regulated pathways that could, indirectly, lead to phosphorylation of eEF2. However, overexpression of PHD2 for 4 h produced a strong inhibition of the hypoxia-dependent phosphorylation of eEF2 (Fig. 4, B and C), an effect that has been also shown for hypoxia-induced HIF stabilization (23.Ginouvès A. Ilc K. Macías N. Pouysségur J. Berra E. PHD overactivation during chronic hypoxia “desensitizes” HIF-α and protects cells from necrosis.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Prolyl hydroxylase domain 2 protein suppresses hypoxia-induced endothelial cell proliferation.Hypertension. 2007; 49: 178-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Altogether, these data suggest the control of PHD2 over the elongation phase of protein translation. PHD2-dependent regulation of translation is independent of HIF-α activity and takes place a few minutes after PHD inhibition (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. 2B). Sequence analyses revealed the presence in eEF2 of three motifs consisting of a proline preceded by two neighboring leucines (LXLXP), resembling the hydroxylation consensus motifs (LXXLAP) existing in the O2-dependent degradation domain of HIF-α (4.Epstein A.C. Gleadle J.M. McNeill L.A. Hewitson K.S. O'Rourke J. Mole D.R. Mukherji M. Metzen E. Wilson M.I. Dhanda A. Tian Y.M. Masson N. Hamilton D.L. Jaakkola P. Barstead R. Hodgkin J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W.

Independent function of two destruction domains in hypoxia-inducible factor α chains activated by prolyl hydroxylation.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). However, additional work will be required to determine whether PHD2 regulates eEF2 by direct hydroxylation of these residues or, alternatively, modulates the activity of other proteins, including eEF2K or any subunit of the cellular phosphatases.O2 influx to tissues can be a fluctuating condition (40.Bristow R.G. Hill R.P. Hypoxia and metabolism. Hypoxia, DNA repair, and genetic instability.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2008; 8: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar); thus, the mechanisms regulating hypoxic responses must be reversible and easily adjustable to oxygen availability. Interestingly, phosphorylation of eEF2 is tightly regulated by the activity of specific kinases and phosphatases (33.Redpath N.T. Proud C.G. Activity of protein phosphatases against initiation factor 2 and elongation factor 2.Biochem. J. 1990; 272: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 34.Redpath N.T. Proud C.G.

Biochem. 1993; 213: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We have shown here that phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr56 by hypoxia is quickly reversed upon returning to normoxia (Fig. 5A). A short exposure (10 min) of cells to a Ser/Thr phosphatase inhibitor leads to marked accumulation of phosphorylated eEF2, indicating a high basal activity of phosphatases acting on eEF2 (Fig. 5B). Our pharmacological studies revealed that acute inhibition of PP2A activity leads to a similar accumulation of phosphorylated eEF2 (Fig. 5C), suggesting a role of this protein in the regulation of protein synthesis by acute hypoxia. The tight regulation and fast reversibility of the eEF2 phosphorylation/dephosphorylation status make this protein an ideal candidate to control the protein synthesis rate in response to variable conditions of tissue O2 availability.In conclusion, we propose a novel mechanism that helps explain acute translational arrest under hypoxia, which is AMPK- and HIF-independent and relies on PHD2-mediated regulation of eEF2 activity (see scheme in Fig. 6). However, a complete understanding of the mechanism whereby PHD2 regulates eEF2 phosphorylation must await further investigation. Besides its obvious interest for the biology of hypoxia and hypoxia/reperfusion, the PHD2-eEF2 pathway could provide new perspectives relevant for the pharmacology of tissue ischemia and cancer. IntroductionCell adaptation to reduced oxygen availability to maintain ATP levels is a major physiologic challenge because O2 deprivation, even transient, can produce irreversible damage.

In this study, we investigated the signal transduction that activated apoptosis in response to the increase of apo-/holo-RBP4 concentration. We found that increase of apo-/holo-RBP4 concentration ratio delayed the displacement of RBP4 with ""stimulated by retinoic acid 6"" (STRA6), enhanced Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/STAT5 cascade, up-regulated adenylate cyclase 6 (AC6), increased cAMP, enhanced JNK1/p38 cascade, suppressed CRBP-I/RARα (cellular retinol-binding protein/retinoic acid receptor α) expression, and led to apoptosis in HK-2 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, STRA6, JAK2, STAT5, JNK1, or p38 siRNA and cAMP-PKA inhibitor reversed the repression of CRBP-I/RARα and apoptosis in apo-RBP4 stimulation. In conclusion, this study indicates that the increase of apo-/holo-RBP4 concentration may influence STRA6 signaling, finally causing apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1969507008,"RGS18 was originally identified as a R4 subfamily member of regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) with specific expression in hematopoietic progenitors, myeloerythroid cells, and megakaryocytes, though its physiological role in hematopoiesis remained unknown. Here, we show that lentiviral RGS18 overexpression during differentiation of mouse Sca1(+) hematopoietic stem cells induced a 50% increase of megakaryocyte proliferation. RGS18 depletion in zebrafish results in thrombocytopenia, as 66 to 88% of the embryos lack thrombocytes after injection of an ATG or splice-blocking morpholino, respectively. These embryos have no defects in early hematopoiesis, erythropoiesis, or leukocyte number and migration. In addition, all RGS18 depleted embryos have curly tails and an almost absent response to acoustic stimuli. In situ hybridization in zebrafish, Xenopus, and mouse embryos shows RGS18 expression in thrombocytes and/or hematological tissues but also in brain and otic vesicles. RGS18 interferes with development of cilia in hair cells of the inner ear and neuromast cells. On the basis of literature evidence that RGS-R4 members interact with the G-protein-modulated Wnt/calcium pathway, Wnt5b- but not Wnt5a-depleted embryos phenocopy all RGS18 knockdown effects. In summary, our study is the first to show that RGS18 regulates megakaryopoiesis but also reveals its unexpected role in ciliogenesis, at least in lower vertebrates, via interference with Wnt signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1964441674,"Sec-tRNA(Sec) is site-specifically delivered at defined UGA codons in selenoprotein mRNAs. This recoding event is specified by the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element and requires the selenocysteine (Sec)-specific elongation factor, eEFSec, and the SECIS binding protein, SBP2. Sec-tRNA(Sec) is delivered to the ribosome by eEFSec-GTP, but this ternary complex is not sufficient for Sec incorporation, indicating that its access to the ribosomal A-site is regulated. SBP2 stably associates with ribosomes, and mutagenic analysis indicates that this interaction is essential for Sec incorporation. However, the ribosomal function of SBP2 has not been elucidated. To shed light on the functional relevance of the SBP2-ribosome interaction, we screened the functional centers of the 28 S rRNA in translationally competent 80 S ribosomes using selective 2'-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (SHAPE). We demonstrate that SBP2 specifically alters the reactivity of specific residues in Helix 89 (H89) and expansion segment 31 (ES31). These results are indicative of a conformational change in response to SBP2 binding. Based on the known functions of H89 during translation, we propose that SBP2 allows Sec incorporation by either promoting Sec-tRNA(Sec) accommodation into the peptidyltransferase center and/or by stimulating the ribosome-dependent GTPase activity of eEFSec."
https://openalex.org/W1966715771,"Bacterial translation initiation factor IF2 promotes ribosomal subunit association, recruitment, and binding of fMet-tRNA to the ribosomal P-site and initiation dipeptide formation. Here, we present the solution structures of GDP-bound and apo-IF2-G2 of Bacillus stearothermophilus and provide evidence that this isolated domain binds the 50 S ribosomal subunit and hydrolyzes GTP. Differences between the free and GDP-bound structures of IF2-G2 suggest that domain reorganization within the G2-G3-C1 regions underlies the different structural requirements of IF2 during the initiation process. However, these structural signals are unlikely forwarded from IF2-G2 to the C-terminal fMet-tRNA binding domain (IF2-C2) because the connected IF2-C1 and IF2-C2 modules show completely independent mobility, indicating that the bacterial interdomain connector lacks the rigidity that was found in the archaeal IF2 homolog aIF5B."
https://openalex.org/W2106698189,"It is well known that the renin-angiotensin system contributes to left ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis, a major determinant of myocardial stiffness. TGF-β1 and renin-angiotensin system signaling alters the fibroblast phenotype by promoting its differentiation into morphologically distinct pathological myofibroblasts, which potentiates collagen synthesis and fibrosis and causes enhanced extracellular matrix deposition. However, the atrial natriuretic peptide, which is induced during left ventricular hypertrophy, plays an anti-fibrogenic and anti-hypertrophic role by blocking, among others, the TGF-β-induced nuclear localization of Smads. It is not clear how the hypertrophic and fibrotic responses are transcriptionally regulated. CLP-1, the mouse homolog of human hexamethylene bis-acetamide inducible-1 (HEXIM-1), regulates the pTEFb activity via direct association with pTEFb causing inhibition of the Cdk9-mediated serine 2 phosphorylation in the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. It was recently reported that the serine kinase activity of Cdk9 not only targets RNA polymerase II but also the conserved serine residues of the polylinker region in Smad3, suggesting that CLP-1-mediated changes in pTEFb activity may trigger Cdk9-dependent Smad3 signaling that can modulate collagen expression and fibrosis. In this study, we evaluated the role of CLP-1 in vivo in induction of left ventricular hypertrophy in angiotensinogen-overexpressing transgenic mice harboring CLP-1 heterozygosity. We observed that introduction of CLP-1 haplodeficiency in the transgenic α-myosin heavy chain-angiotensinogen mice causes prominent changes in hypertrophic and fibrotic responses accompanied by augmentation of Smad3/Stat3 signaling. Together, our findings underscore the critical role of CLP-1 in remodeling of the genetic response during hypertrophy and fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2023151875,"The immortalization process is a fundamental step in the development of most (if not all) human cancers, including the aggressive endothelial cell (EC)-derived malignancy angiosarcoma. Inactivation of the tumor suppressor p16INK4a and the development of multiple chromosomal abnormalities are features of angiosarcoma that are recapitulated during telomerase-mediated immortalization of human ECs in vitro. The present study used a panel of telomerase-immortalized bone marrow EC (BMEC) lines to define the consequences of inactivation of p16INK4a on EC function and to identify molecular changes associated with repression of p16INK4a. In a comparison of two immortalized BMEC mass cultures and six clones, the cell lines that repressed p16INK4a showed a higher rate of proliferation and an impaired ability to undergo morphogenic differentiation and form vessel-like structures in vitro. Proteomic comparison of a p16INK4a-negative and a p16INK4a-positive BMEC mass culture at early- and late-passage time points following transduction with telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) revealed altered expression of cytoskeletal proteins, including vimentin and α-tropomyosin (αTm), in the immortal cells. Immunoblot analyses of a panel of 11 immortal clones showed that cells that lacked p16INK4a expression tended to accumulate more dramatic changes in these cytoskeletal proteins than cells that retained p16INK4a expression. This corresponded with aberrant cytoskeletal architectures among p16INK4a-negative clones, which featured thicker actin stress fibers and less fluid membrane ruffles than p16INK4a-positive cells. A direct link between p16INK4a repression and defective EC function was confirmed by analysis of normal cells transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting p16INK4a. siRNA-mediated repression of p16INK4a significantly impaired random motility and vessel formation in vitro. This report is the first to demonstrate that ECs that repress the expression of p16INK4a are prone to defects in motility, morphogenesis and cytoskeletal organization. These defects are likely to reflect alterations that occur during the development of EC-derived malignancies."
https://openalex.org/W2074948166,"Labdane diterpenoids have a broad spectrum of biological activities including antibacterial, antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. However, little is known about their possible role in the apoptotic cell death machinery. Here, we report that hispanolone derivatives, a group of labdane diterpenoids, induce apoptosis in different tumor cell lines by activating caspase-8 with subsequent participation of mitochondrial signaling. Activation of caspase-8 by hispanolone derivatives was followed by a decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of apoptotic factors from mitochondria to the cytosol, and activation of caspases-9 and 3. Hispanolone derivatives also led to a time-dependent cleavage of Bid. Inhibition of caspase-8 abrogated these processes, suggesting that the death receptor pathway has a critical role in the apoptotic events induced by hispanolone derivatives. In addition, silencing death receptors with small interfering RNA s or pretreating cells with neutralizing antibodies to Fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNF-R1), and TNF-α receptor 2 (TRAIL) inhibited diterpenoid-induced apoptosis, revealing it to be dependent on these death receptors. Interestingly, hispanolone derivatives had no effect on non-tumor cells. Consistently, in vivo bioluminescence imaging corroborates this antineoplasic effect, as hispanolone derivatives significantly decrease cancer growth in tumor xenograft assays. These data demostrate the antitumoral effects of hispanolone derivatives and provide relevant preclinical validation for the use of these compounds as potent therapeutic agents in cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2014095248,"RUNX proteins are evolutionarily conserved transcription factors known to be involved in various developmental processes. Here we report a new role for a RUNX protein: a role in stress response. We show that RNT-1, the Caenorhabditis elegans RUNX homolog, is constantly produced and degraded by the ubiquitination-proteasome pathway in the intestine of the nematode. RNT-1 was rapidly stabilized by oxidative stress, and the rnt-1-mutant animals were more sensitive to oxidative stress, indicating that rapid RNT-1 stabilization is a defense response against the oxidative stress. The MAP kinase pathway is required for RNT-1 stabilization, and RNT-1 was phosphorylated by SEK-1/PMK-1 in vitro. ChIP-sequencing analysis revealed a feedback loop mechanism of the MAP kinase pathway by the VHP-1 phosphatase in the RNT-1-mediated oxidative stress response. We propose that rnt-1 is regulated at the protein level for its role in the immediate response to environmental challenges in the intestine."
