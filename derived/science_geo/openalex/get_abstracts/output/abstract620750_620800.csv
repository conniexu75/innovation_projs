https://openalex.org/W2896481903,"The development of the microbiome from infancy to childhood is dependent on a range of factors, with microbial-immune crosstalk during this time thought to be involved in the pathobiology of later life diseases1-9 such as persistent islet autoimmunity and type 1 diabetes10-12. However, to our knowledge, no studies have performed extensive characterization of the microbiome in early life in a large, multi-centre population. Here we analyse longitudinal stool samples from 903 children between 3 and 46 months of age by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (n = 12,005) and metagenomic sequencing (n = 10,867), as part of the The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. We show that the developing gut microbiome undergoes three distinct phases of microbiome progression: a developmental phase (months 3-14), a transitional phase (months 15-30), and a stable phase (months 31-46). Receipt of breast milk, either exclusive or partial, was the most significant factor associated with the microbiome structure. Breastfeeding was associated with higher levels of Bifidobacterium species (B. breve and B. bifidum), and the cessation of breast milk resulted in faster maturation of the gut microbiome, as marked by the phylum Firmicutes. Birth mode was also significantly associated with the microbiome during the developmental phase, driven by higher levels of Bacteroides species (particularly B. fragilis) in infants delivered vaginally. Bacteroides was also associated with increased gut diversity and faster maturation, regardless of the birth mode. Environmental factors including geographical location and household exposures (such as siblings and furry pets) also represented important covariates. A nested case-control analysis revealed subtle associations between microbial taxonomy and the development of islet autoimmunity or type 1 diabetes. These data determine the structural and functional assembly of the microbiome in early life and provide a foundation for targeted mechanistic investigation into the consequences of microbial-immune crosstalk for long-term health."
https://openalex.org/W2896252141,"With the rapid development of artificial intelligence have come concerns about how machines will make moral decisions, and the major challenge of quantifying societal expectations about the ethical principles that should guide machine behaviour. To address this challenge, we deployed the Moral Machine, an online experimental platform designed to explore the moral dilemmas faced by autonomous vehicles. This platform gathered 40 million decisions in ten languages from millions of people in 233 countries and territories. Here we describe the results of this experiment. First, we summarize global moral preferences. Second, we document individual variations in preferences, based on respondents’ demographics. Third, we report cross-cultural ethical variation, and uncover three major clusters of countries. Fourth, we show that these differences correlate with modern institutions and deep cultural traits. We discuss how these preferences can contribute to developing global, socially acceptable principles for machine ethics. All data used in this article are publicly available. Responses from more than two million people to an internet-based survey of attitudes towards moral dilemmas that might be faced by autonomous vehicles shed light on similarities and variations in ethical preferences among different populations."
https://openalex.org/W2896617742,"Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease that targets pancreatic islet beta cells and incorporates genetic and environmental factors1, including complex genetic elements2, patient exposures3 and the gut microbiome4. Viral infections5 and broader gut dysbioses6 have been identified as potential causes or contributing factors; however, human studies have not yet identified microbial compositional or functional triggers that are predictive of islet autoimmunity or T1D. Here we analyse 10,913 metagenomes in stool samples from 783 mostly white, non-Hispanic children. The samples were collected monthly from three months of age until the clinical end point (islet autoimmunity or T1D) in the The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study, to characterize the natural history of the early gut microbiome in connection to islet autoimmunity, T1D diagnosis, and other common early life events such as antibiotic treatments and probiotics. The microbiomes of control children contained more genes that were related to fermentation and the biosynthesis of short-chain fatty acids, but these were not consistently associated with particular taxa across geographically diverse clinical centres, suggesting that microbial factors associated with T1D are taxonomically diffuse but functionally more coherent. When we investigated the broader establishment and development of the infant microbiome, both taxonomic and functional profiles were dynamic and highly individualized, and dominated in the first year of life by one of three largely exclusive Bifidobacterium species (B. bifidum, B. breve or B. longum) or by the phylum Proteobacteria. In particular, the strain-specific carriage of genes for the utilization of human milk oligosaccharide within a subset of B. longum was present specifically in breast-fed infants. These analyses of TEDDY gut metagenomes provide, to our knowledge, the largest and most detailed longitudinal functional profile of the developing gut microbiome in relation to islet autoimmunity, T1D and other early childhood events. Together with existing evidence from human cohorts7,8 and a T1D mouse model9, these data support the protective effects of short-chain fatty acids in early-onset human T1D. An analysis of more than 10,000 metagenomes from the TEDDY study provides a detailed functional profile of the gut microbiome in relation to islet autoimmunity, and supports the protective effects of short-chain fatty acids in early-onset type 1 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2896394934,"Polaritons-hybrid light-matter excitations-enable nanoscale control of light. Particularly large polariton field confinement and long lifetimes can be found in graphene and materials consisting of two-dimensional layers bound by weak van der Waals forces1,2 (vdW materials). These polaritons can be tuned by electric fields3,4 or by material thickness5, leading to applications including nanolasers6, tunable infrared and terahertz detectors7, and molecular sensors8. Polaritons with anisotropic propagation along the surface of vdW materials have been predicted, caused by in-plane anisotropic structural and electronic properties9. In such materials, elliptic and hyperbolic in-plane polariton dispersion can be expected (for example, plasmon polaritons in black phosphorus9), the latter leading to an enhanced density of optical states and ray-like directional propagation along the surface. However, observation of anisotropic polariton propagation in natural materials has so far remained elusive. Here we report anisotropic polariton propagation along the surface of α-MoO3, a natural vdW material. By infrared nano-imaging and nano-spectroscopy of semiconducting α-MoO3 flakes and disks, we visualize and verify phonon polaritons with elliptic and hyperbolic in-plane dispersion, and with wavelengths (up to 60 times smaller than the corresponding photon wavelengths) comparable to those of graphene plasmon polaritons and boron nitride phonon polaritons3-5. From signal oscillations in real-space images we measure polariton amplitude lifetimes of 8 picoseconds, which is more than ten times larger than that of graphene plasmon polaritons at room temperature10. They are also a factor of about four larger than the best values so far reported for phonon polaritons in isotopically engineered boron nitride11 and for graphene plasmon polaritons at low temperatures12. In-plane anisotropic and ultra-low-loss polaritons in vdW materials could enable directional and strong light-matter interactions, nanoscale directional energy transfer and integrated flat optics in applications ranging from bio-sensing to quantum nanophotonics."

https://openalex.org/W2895826492,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) is a co-substrate for several enzymes, including the sirtuin family of NAD+-dependent protein deacylases. Beneficial effects of increased NAD+ levels and sirtuin activation on mitochondrial homeostasis, organismal metabolism and lifespan have been established across species. Here we show that α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-e-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD), the enzyme that limits spontaneous cyclization of α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-e-semialdehyde in the de novo NAD+ synthesis pathway, controls cellular NAD+ levels via an evolutionarily conserved mechanism in Caenorhabditis elegans and mouse. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ACMSD boosts de novo NAD+ synthesis and sirtuin 1 activity, ultimately enhancing mitochondrial function. We also characterize two potent and selective inhibitors of ACMSD. Because expression of ACMSD is largely restricted to kidney and liver, these inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for protection of these tissues from injury. In summary, we identify ACMSD as a key modulator of cellular NAD+ levels, sirtuin activity and mitochondrial homeostasis in kidney and liver."
https://openalex.org/W2896055880,"Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and basic metabolic processes. The application of nitrogen-containing fertilizer increases yield, which has been a substantial factor in the green revolution1. Ecologically, however, excessive application of fertilizer has disastrous effects such as eutrophication2. A better understanding of how plants regulate nitrogen metabolism is critical to increase plant yield and reduce fertilizer overuse. Here we present a transcriptional regulatory network and twenty-one transcription factors that regulate the architecture of root and shoot systems in response to changes in nitrogen availability. Genetic perturbation of a subset of these transcription factors revealed coordinate transcriptional regulation of enzymes involved in nitrogen metabolism. Transcriptional regulators in the network are transcriptionally modified by feedback via genetic perturbation of nitrogen metabolism. The network, genes and gene-regulatory modules identified here will prove critical to increasing agricultural productivity. The yeast one-hybrid network for nitrogen-associated metabolism in Arabidopsis reveals the transcription factors that regulate the architecture of root and shoot systems under conditions of changing nitrogen availability."
https://openalex.org/W2897662588,"The Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of organoboron nucleophiles with aryl halide electrophiles is one of the most widely used carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions in organic and medicinal chemistry1,2. A key challenge associated with these transformations is that they generally require the addition of an exogenous base, the role of which is to enable transmetallation between the organoboron nucleophile and the metal catalyst3. This requirement limits the substrate scope of the reaction because the added base promotes competitive decomposition of many organoboron substrates3-5. As such, considerable research has focused on strategies for mitigating base-mediated side reactions6-12. Previous efforts have primarily focused either on designing strategically masked organoboron reagents (to slow base-mediated decomposition)6-8 or on developing highly active palladium precatalysts (to accelerate cross-coupling relative to base-mediated decomposition pathways)10-12. An attractive alternative approach involves identifying combinations of catalyst and electrophile that enable Suzuki-Miyaura-type reactions to proceed without an exogenous base12-14. Here we use this approach to develop a nickel-catalysed coupling of aryl boronic acids with acid fluorides15-17, which are formed in situ from readily available carboxylic acids18-22. This combination of catalyst and electrophile enables a mechanistic manifold in which a 'transmetallation-active' aryl nickel fluoride intermediate is generated directly in the catalytic cycle13,16. As such, this transformation does not require an exogenous base and is applicable to a wide range of base-sensitive boronic acids and biologically active carboxylic acids."
https://openalex.org/W2897165841,"While research into the biology of animal behaviour has primarily focused on the central nervous system, cues from peripheral tissues and the environment have been implicated in brain development and function1. There is emerging evidence that bidirectional communication between the gut and the brain affects behaviours including anxiety, cognition, nociception and social interaction1–9. Coordinated locomotor behaviour is critical for the survival and propagation of animals, and is regulated by internal and external sensory inputs10,11. However, little is known about how the gut microbiome influences host locomotion, or the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved. Here we report that germ-free status or antibiotic treatment results in hyperactive locomotor behaviour in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Increased walking speed and daily activity in the absence of a gut microbiome are rescued by mono-colonization with specific bacteria, including the fly commensal Lactobacillus brevis. The bacterial enzyme xylose isomerase from L. brevis recapitulates the locomotor effects of microbial colonization by modulating sugar metabolism in flies. Notably, thermogenetic activation of octopaminergic neurons or exogenous administration of octopamine, the invertebrate counterpart of noradrenaline, abrogates the effects of xylose isomerase on Drosophila locomotion. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for the gut microbiome in modulating locomotion, and identify octopaminergic neurons as mediators of peripheral microbial cues that regulate motor behaviour in animals. Female Drosophila that lack a microbiota are hyperactive, and xylose isomerase from Lactobacillus brevis is sufficient to reverse this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2899479888,"About 99 per cent of solar energy is produced through sequences of nuclear reactions that convert hydrogen into helium, starting from the fusion of two protons (the pp chain). The neutrinos emitted by five of these reactions represent a unique probe of the Sun’s internal working and, at the same time, offer an intense natural neutrino beam for fundamental physics. Here we report a complete study of the pp chain. We measure the neutrino–electron elastic-scattering rates for neutrinos produced by four reactions of the chain: the initial proton–proton fusion, the electron-capture decay of beryllium-7, the three-body proton–electron–proton (pep) fusion, here measured with the highest precision so far achieved, and the boron-8 beta decay, measured with the lowest energy threshold. We also set a limit on the neutrino flux produced by the 3He–proton fusion (hep). These measurements provide a direct determination of the relative intensity of the two primary terminations of the pp chain (pp-I and pp-II) and an indication that the temperature profile in the Sun is more compatible with solar models that assume high surface metallicity. We also determine the survival probability of solar electron neutrinos at different energies, thus probing simultaneously and with high precision the neutrino flavour-conversion paradigm, both in vacuum and in matter-dominated regimes."
https://openalex.org/W2897567693,"During both embryonic development and adult tissue regeneration, changes in chromatin structure driven by master transcription factors lead to stimulus-responsive transcriptional programs. A thorough understanding of how stem cells in the skeleton interpret mechanical stimuli and enact regeneration would shed light on how forces are transduced to the nucleus in regenerative processes. Here we develop a genetically dissectible mouse model of mandibular distraction osteogenesis-which is a process that is used in humans to correct an undersized lower jaw that involves surgically separating the jaw bone, which elicits new bone growth in the gap. We use this model to show that regions of newly formed bone are clonally derived from stem cells that reside in the skeleton. Using chromatin and transcriptional profiling, we show that these stem-cell populations gain activity within the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signalling pathway, and that inhibiting FAK abolishes new bone formation. Mechanotransduction via FAK in skeletal stem cells during distraction activates a gene-regulatory program and retrotransposons that are normally active in primitive neural crest cells, from which skeletal stem cells arise during development. This reversion to a developmental state underlies the robust tissue growth that facilitates stem-cell-based regeneration of adult skeletal tissue."
https://openalex.org/W2895808009,"Large meteorite impact structures on the terrestrial bodies of the Solar System contain pronounced topographic rings, which emerged from uplifted target (crustal) rocks within minutes of impact. To flow rapidly over large distances, these target rocks must have weakened drastically, but they subsequently regained sufficient strength to build and sustain topographic rings. The mechanisms of rock deformation that accomplish such extreme change in mechanical behaviour during cratering are largely unknown and have been debated for decades. Recent drilling of the approximately 200-km-diameter Chicxulub impact structure in Mexico has produced a record of brittle and viscous deformation within its peak-ring rocks. Here we show how catastrophic rock weakening upon impact is followed by an increase in rock strength that culminated in the formation of the peak ring during cratering. The observations point to quasi-continuous rock flow and hence acoustic fluidization as the dominant physical process controlling initial cratering, followed by increasingly localized faulting. Catastrophic rock weakening upon impact of a meteorite, and hence flow, is shown to be followed by regained rock strength that enabled the formation of the peak ring during cratering."
https://openalex.org/W2897663057,"Promoting the adoption of public goods that are not yet widely accepted is particularly challenging. This is because most tools for increasing cooperation—such as reputation concerns1 and information about social norms2—are typically effective only for behaviours that are commonly practiced, or at least generally agreed upon as being desirable. Here we examine how advocates can successfully promote non-normative (that is, rare or unpopular) public goods. We do so by applying the cultural evolutionary theory of credibility-enhancing displays3, which argues that beliefs are spread more effectively by actions than by words alone—because actions provide information about the actor’s true beliefs. Based on this logic, people who themselves engage in a given behaviour will be more effective advocates for that behaviour than people who merely extol its virtues—specifically because engaging in a behaviour credibly signals a belief in its value. As predicted, a field study of a programme that promotes residential solar panel installation in 58 towns in the United States—comprising 1.4 million residents in total—found that community organizers who themselves installed through the programme recruited 62.8% more residents to install solar panels than community organizers who did not. This effect was replicated in three pre-registered randomized survey experiments (total n = 1,805). These experiments also support the theoretical prediction that this effect is specifically driven by subjects’ beliefs about what the community organizer believes about solar panels (that is, second-order beliefs), and demonstrate generalizability to four other highly non-normative behaviours. Our findings shed light on how to spread non-normative prosocial behaviours, offer an empirical demonstration of credibility-enhancing displays and have substantial implications for practitioners and policy-makers. A field study and three experiments demonstrate that people who engage in rare (non-normative) prosocial behaviours will be more effective advocates for those behaviours than people who merely praise the virtues of these prosocial behaviours."
https://openalex.org/W2898124867,"Dry and early lactation periods represent the most critical phases for udder health in cattle, especially in highly productive breeds, such as the Holstein Friesian (HF). On the other hand, some autochthonous cattle breeds, such as the Rendena (REN), have a lower prevalence of mastitis and other transition-related diseases. In this study, milk microbiota of 6 HF and 3 REN cows, all raised on the same farm under the same conditions, was compared. A special focus was placed on the transition period to define bacterial groups' prevalence with a plausible effect on mammary gland health. Four time points (dry-off, 1 d, 7-10 d and 30 d after calving) were considered. Through 16S rRNA sequencing, we characterized the microbiota composition for 117 out of the 144 milk samples initially collected, keeping only the healthy quarters, in order to focus on physiological microbiome changes and avoid shifts due to suspected diseases. Microbial populations were very different in the two breeds along all the time points, with REN milk showing a significantly lower microbial biodiversity. The taxonomic profiles of both cosmopolitan and local breeds were dominated by Firmicutes, mostly represented by the Streptococcus genus, although in very different proportions (HF 27.5%, REN 68.6%). Large differences in HF and REN cows were, also, evident from the metabolic predictive analysis from microbiome data. Finally, only HF milk displayed significant changes in the microbial composition along the transition period, while REN maintained a more stable microbiota. In conclusion, in addition to the influence on the final characteristics of dairy products obtained from milk of the two breeds, differences in the milk microbiome might, also, have an impact on their mammary gland health."

https://openalex.org/W2898276531,"Intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates bone formation in vivo and also suppresses the volume of bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT). In contrast, a calorie-restricted (CR) diet causes bone loss and induces BMAT in both mice and humans. We used the CR model to test whether PTH would reduce BMAT in mice by both altering cell fate and inducing lipolysis of marrow adipocytes. Eight-week-old mice were placed on a control (Ctrl) diet or CR diet. At 12 wk, CR and Ctrl mice were injected daily with PTH (CR/PTH or Ctrl/PTH) or vehicle for 4 wk. Two other cohorts were CR and simultaneously injected (CR + PTH or CR + Veh) for 4 wk. CR mice had low bone mass and increased BMAT in the proximal tibias. PTH significantly increased bone mass in all cohorts despite calorie restrictions. Adipocyte density and size were markedly increased with restriction of calories. PTH reduced adipocyte numbers in CR + PTH mice, whereas adipocyte size was reduced in CR/PTH-treated mice. In contrast, osteoblast number was increased 3-8-fold with PTH treatment. In vitro, bone marrow stromal cells differentiated into adipocytes and, treated with PTH, exhibited increased production of glycerol and fatty acids. Moreover, in cocultures of bone marrow adipocyte and osteoblast progenitors, PTH stimulated the transfer of fatty acids to osteoblasts. In summary, PTH administration to CR mice increased bone mass by shifting lineage allocation toward osteogenesis and inducing lipolysis of mature marrow adipocytes. The effects of PTH on bone marrow adiposity could enhance its anabolic actions by providing both more cells and more fuel for osteoblasts during bone formation.-Maridas, D. E., Rendina-Ruedy, E., Helderman, R. C., DeMambro, V. E., Brooks, D., Guntur, A. R., Lanske, B., Bouxsein, M. L., Rosen, C. J.

https://openalex.org/W2896137732,"Migration of human glioma cells (hGCs) within the brain parenchyma makes glioblastoma one of the most aggressive and lethal tumors. Studies of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying hGC migration are hindered by the limitations of existing glioma models. Here we developed a dorsal root ganglion axon-oligodendrocyte-hGC co-culture to study in real time the migration and interaction of hGCs with their microenvironment. hGCs interact with myelinated and non-myelinated axons through the formation of pseudopodia. Isolation of pseudopodia-localized polysome-bound RNA reveals transcripts of Lck, Paxillin, Crk-II, and Rac1 that undergo local translation. Inhibition of Lck phosphorylation using a small-molecule inhibitor (Lck-I), blocks the phosphorylation of Paxillin and Crk-II, the formation of pseudopodia and the migration of hGCs. In vivo intraventricular administration of the Lck-I using an orthotopic xenograft glioma model, results in statistically significant inhibition of tumor size and significant down-regulation of Nanog-targeted genes, which are associated with glioblastoma patient survival. Moreover, treatment of human glioma stem cells (hGSCs) with Lck-I, results in significant inhibition of self-renewal and tumor-sphere formation. The involvement of Lck in different levels of glioma malignant progression, such as migration, tumor growth, and regulation of cancer stemness, makes Lck a potentially important therapeutic target for human glioblastomas."

The virtual reality-based training system replicated patients´ upper limb movements in real-time to manipulate virtual objects. Blinded assessors tested patients twice before, once during, and twice after the intervention up to 2-month follow-up for dexterity (primary outcome: Box and Block Test), bimanual upper limb function (Chedoke-McMaster Arm and Hand Activity Inventory), and subjective perceived changes (Stroke Impact Scale).54 eligible patients (70 screened) participated (15 females, mean age 61.3 years, range 20-81 years, time since stroke 3.0±SD 3 years). 22 patients were allocated to the experimental group and 32 to the control group (3 drop-outs). Patients in the experimental and control group improved: Box and Block Test mean 21.5±SD 16 baseline to mean 24.1±SD 17 follow-up; Chedoke-McMaster Arm and Hand Activity Inventory mean 66.0±SD 21 baseline to mean 70.2±SD 19 follow-up. An intention-to-treat analysis found no between-group differences.Patients in the experimental and control group showed similar effects, with most improvements occurring in the first two weeks and persisting until the end of the two-month follow-up period. The study population had moderate to severely impaired motor function at entry (Box and Block Test mean 21.5±SD 16). Patients, who were less impaired (Box and Block Test range 18 to 72) showed higher improvements in favor of the experimental group. This result could suggest that virtual reality-based training might be more applicable for such patients than for more severely impaired patients.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01774669."
https://openalex.org/W2898531172,"In mid-February 2015, a large number of deaths were observed in the sole extant population of an endangered species of freshwater snapping turtle, Myuchelys georgesi, in a coastal river in New South Wales, Australia. Mortalities continued for approximately 7 weeks and affected mostly adult animals. More than 400 dead or dying animals were observed and population surveys conducted after the outbreak had ceased indicated that only a very small proportion of the population had survived, severely threatening the viability of the wild population. At necropsy, animals were in poor body condition, had bilateral swollen eyelids and some animals had tan foci on the skin of the ventral thighs. Histological examination revealed peri-orbital, splenic and nephric inflammation and necrosis. A virus was isolated in cell culture from a range of tissues. Nucleic acid sequencing of the virus isolate has identified the entire genome and indicates that this is a novel nidovirus that has a low level of nucleotide similarity to recognised nidoviruses. Its closest relatives are nidoviruses that have recently been described in pythons and lizards, usually in association with respiratory disease. In contrast, in the affected turtles, the most significant pathological changes were in the kidneys. Real time PCR assays developed to detect this virus demonstrated very high virus loads in affected tissues. In situ hybridisation studies confirmed the presence of viral nucleic acid in tissues in association with pathological changes. Collectively these data suggest that this virus is the likely cause of the mortalities that now threaten the survival of this species. Bellinger River Virus is the name proposed for this new virus."
https://openalex.org/W2896850868,"Biosynthesis of glycogen, the essential glucose (and hence energy) storage molecule in humans, animals and fungi1, is initiated by the glycosyltransferase enzyme, glycogenin (GYG). Deficiencies in glycogen formation cause neurodegenerative and metabolic disease2–4, and mouse knockout5 and inherited human mutations6 of GYG impair glycogen synthesis. GYG acts as a ‘seed core’ for the formation of the glycogen particle by catalysing its own stepwise autoglucosylation to form a covalently bound gluco-oligosaccharide chain at initiation site Tyr 195. Precise mechanistic studies have so far been prevented by an inability to access homogeneous glycoforms of this protein, which unusually acts as both catalyst and substrate. Here we show that unprecedented direct access to different, homogeneously glucosylated states of GYG can be accomplished through a palladium-mediated enzyme activation ‘shunt’ process using on-protein C–C bond formation. Careful mimicry of GYG intermediates recapitulates catalytic activity at distinct stages, which in turn allows discovery of triphasic kinetics and substrate plasticity in GYG’s use of sugar substrates. This reveals a tolerant but ‘proof-read’ mechanism that underlies the precision of this metabolic process. The present demonstration of direct, chemically controlled access to intermediate states of active enzymes suggests that such ligation-dependent activation could be a powerful tool in the study of mechanism. The mechanism of glycogenesis, initiated by glycogenin, involves three distinct kinetic phases, with the final phase involving a refining process where only glucose is tolerated as a substrate."

Tissue engineering approaches attempt to replicate the complex anatomy and structure of the ear with autologous cartilage but have been limited by access to clinically accessible cell sources. Here we present a full-scale, patient-based human ear generated by implantation of human auricular chondrocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells in a 1:1 ratio. Additional disc construct surrogates were generated with 1:0, 1:1, and 0:1 combinations of auricular chondrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells. After 3 months in vivo, monocellular auricular chondrocyte discs and 1:1 disc and ear constructs displayed bundled collagen fibers in a perichondrial layer, rich proteoglycan deposition, and elastin fiber network formation similar to native human auricular cartilage, with the protein composition and mechanical stiffness of native tissue. Full ear constructs with a 1:1 cell combination maintained gross ear structure and developed a cartilaginous appearance following implantation. These studies demonstrate the successful engineering of a patient-specific human auricle using exclusively human cell sources without extensive in vitro tissue culture prior to implantation, a critical step towards the clinical application of tissue engineering for auricular reconstruction."
https://openalex.org/W2898462755,"The striatum receives extensive cortical input and plays a prominent role in motor learning and habit formation. Glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR)-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP) is a major synaptic plasticity involved in learning and memory. However, the molecular mechanism underlying NMDAR plasticity in corticostriatal LTP is unclear. Here, we show that theta-burst stimulation (TBS) consistently induced corticostriatal LTP and increased the coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity of medium spiny neurons. We also found that α2δ-1 (previously known as a subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels; encoded by the Cacna2d1 gene) physically interacted with NMDARs in the striatum of mice and humans, indicating that this cross-talk is conserved across species. Strikingly, inhibiting α2δ-1 trafficking with gabapentin or disrupting the α2δ-1–NMDAR interaction with an α2δ-1 C terminus–interfering peptide abolished TBS-induced LTP. In Cacna2d1-knockout mice, TBS failed to induce corticostriatal LTP and the associated increases in presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activities. Moreover, systemic gabapentin treatment, microinjection of α2δ-1 C terminus–interfering peptide into the dorsomedial striatum, or Cacna2d1 ablation impaired the alternation T-maze task and rotarod performance in mice. Our findings indicate that the interaction between α2δ-1 and NMDARs is of high physiological relevance and that a TBS-induced switch from α2δ-1–free to α2δ-1–bound NMDARs is critically involved in corticostriatal LTP and LTP-associated learning and memory.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying NMDAR plasticity in corticostriatal LTP is unclear. Here, we show that theta-burst stimulation (TBS) consistently induced corticostriatal LTP and increased the coincident presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity of medium spiny neurons. We also found that α2δ-1 (previously known as a subunit of voltage-gated calcium channels; encoded by the Cacna2d1 gene) physically interacted with NMDARs in the striatum of mice and humans, indicating that this cross-talk is conserved across species. Strikingly, inhibiting α2δ-1 trafficking with gabapentin or disrupting the α2δ-1–NMDAR interaction with an α2δ-1 C terminus–interfering peptide abolished TBS-induced LTP. In Cacna2d1-knockout mice, TBS failed to induce corticostriatal LTP and the associated increases in presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activities. Moreover, systemic gabapentin treatment, microinjection of α2δ-1 C terminus–interfering peptide into the dorsomedial striatum, or Cacna2d1 ablation impaired the alternation T-maze task and rotarod performance in mice. Our findings indicate that the interaction between α2δ-1 and NMDARs is of high physiological relevance and that a TBS-induced switch from α2δ-1–free to α2δ-1–bound NMDARs is critically involved in corticostriatal LTP and LTP-associated learning and memory. Gabapentinoids at high doses may adversely affect cognitive function by targeting α2δ-1–NMDAR complexes. Learning and memory crucially depend on long-lasting synaptic plasticity in neuronal networks including the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum. The striatum, the largest part of the forebrain input regions, plays critical roles in skill development, instrumental learning, and habit formation (1Pennartz C.M. Berke J.D. Graybiel A.M. Ito R.

For a long time, α2δ-1 has been considered to be engaged exclusively in the regulation of VGCCs. However, α2δ-1 has a weak interaction with VGCC α1 subunits in the brain (15Müller C.S. Haupt A.

Interestingly, γ2 (stargazin) was also identified initially as a VGCC subunit but is now known to play primary roles in regulating AMPA receptors (23Chen L. Chetkovich D.M. Petralia R.S. Sweeney N.T.

Although α2δ-1 is involved in neurological disorders including epilepsy and chronic pain, its physiological role in learning and memory remains unknown. Because α2δ-1 is highly expressed in the cortical and striatal regions (21Cole R.L. Lechner S.M. Williams M.E. Prodanovich P. Bleicher L. Varney M.A. Gu G.

We present our new findings that α2δ-1 is essential for corticostriatal LTP and the associated increase in the presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDAR activity of MSNs in the dorsomedial striatum. We also show the important role of α2δ-1–NMDAR complexes in the physiological process such as striatal learning and memory. This information advances our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the synaptic plasticity engaged in learning and memory. Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) can mimic the theta rhythm firing of dorsomedial neurons during various cognitive tasks (24DeCoteau W.E. Thorn C. Gibson D.J. Courtemanche R. Mitra P. Kubota Y. Graybiel A.M. Oscillations of local field potentials in the rat dorsal striatum during spontaneous and instructed behaviors.J.

In extracellular recording of population spikes, TBS is much more effective than is single tetanic stimulation at evoking LTP in the dorsomedial striatum (8Hawes S.L. Gillani F. Evans R.C. Benkert E.A. Blackwell K.T. Sensitivity to theta-burst timing permits LTP in dorsal striatal adult brain slice.J.

MSNs constitute the major cell type, comprising ∼95% of striatal neurons in rodents (26Tepper J.M. Bolam J.P. Functional diversity and specificity of neostriatal interneurons.Curr. Opin.

We performed whole-cell recording of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in individual MSNs to determine the TBS-induced LTP in the dorsomedial striatum of mice. The MSNs were visually identified in brain slices and were characterized by inward rectification and delayed firing in response to depolarization (Fig. 1A), as reported previously (27Jia Y. Gall C.M. Lynch G. Presynaptic BDNF promotes postsynaptic long-term potentiation in the dorsal striatum.J.

As expected, TBS (10 trains of stimuli spaced at 10-s intervals, with each train containing bursts of 4 spikes at 100 Hz, repeated 10 times at 5 Hz) (8Hawes S.L. Gillani F. Evans R.C. Benkert E.A.

The time course of this electrical TBS-induced LTP expression (via whole-cell current-clamp recording in parasagittal striatal slices) was similar to what was induced using an optical TBS approach (7Park H. Popescu A. Poo M.M. Essential role of presynaptic NMDA receptors in activity-dependent BDNF secretion and corticostriatal LTP.Neuron. 2014; 84 (25467984): 1009-102210.1016/j.neuron.2014.10.045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine whether NMDARs are required for TBS-induced corticostriatal LTP in MSNs, we performed an EPSP recording in the presence of (2R)-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (AP5, 50 μm), a specific NMDAR antagonist. Treatment with AP5 abolished LTP induction by TBS in all recorded MSNs (Fig. 1B). Presynaptic NMDARs at cortical axon terminals are critically involved in TBS-induced corticostriatal LTP (7Park H. Popescu A. Poo M.M. Essential role of presynaptic NMDA receptors in activity-dependent BDNF secretion and corticostriatal LTP.Neuron. 2014; 84 (25467984): 1009-102210.1016/j.neuron.2014.10.045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We next determined whether postsynaptic NMDARs are similarly involved in corticostriatal LTP induced by TBS. We blocked the postsynaptic NMDARs of MSNs through intracellular dialysis of MK-801 (50 μm), an NMDAR open-channel blocker, included in the pipette recording solution (29Zhou H.Y. Chen S.R. Chen H. Pan H.L. Opioid-induced long-term potentiation in the spinal cord is a presynaptic event.J.

TBS failed to induce LTP in all MSNs when an MK-801–containing intracellular solution was used for whole-cell recording (Fig. 1B). Thus, both presynaptic and postsynaptic NMDARs are equally important to corticostriatal LTP induction. We recently showed that α2δ-1 is a new interacting protein of NMDARs in the spinal cord and potentiates synaptic NMDAR activity (17Chen J. Li L. Chen S.R. Chen H. Xie J.D. Sirrieh R.E. MacLean D.M.

Neurol. 2005; 491 (16134135): 246-26910.1002/cne.20693Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Because GluN1 is an obligatory subunit of NMDARs, we determined whether α2δ-1 physically interacts with GluN1 in the striatum. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays showed that α2δ-1 antibody, not the irrelevant IgG, precipitated the GluN1 protein in both the mouse (Fig. 2A) and human striatal tissues (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, immunoblotting using the flow-through samples (i.e. removing the α2δ-1–bound GluN1 protein complex; Fig. 2C) showed that α2δ-1–free GluN1 protein bands were still detected (Fig. 2D). Compared with the input samples (total membrane protein lysates), a considerable portion (55.7%) of membrane GluN1 proteins was not bound to α2δ-1 (Fig. 2E). Immunoblotting of flow-through samples that were subjected to further immunoprecipitation using GluN1 antibody showed that only GluN1, but not α2δ-1, was detected, confirming that GluN1 is not bound to α2δ-1 in flow-through samples (Fig. 2F). These results suggest that ∼44.3% of membrane NMDARs form a protein complex with α2δ-1 in the striatum. Although NMDARs are relatively stable at the synaptic site (30Allison D.W. Gelfand V.I.

The mouse brain slices were pretreated with gabapentin (100 μm) for 30–60 min before LTP induction. In brain slices treated with gabapentin, TBS did not increase the amplitude of EPSPs in any of the MSNs examined (Fig. 3A). α2δ-1 interacts with NMDARs predominantly through its transmembrane C terminus (17Chen J.

Because α2δ-1 primarily promotes forward trafficking of intracellular α2δ-1–bound NMDARs, we fused the peptide to the cell-penetrating peptide Tat (YGRKKRRQRRR), generating α2δ-1Tat peptide to disrupt the interaction between α2δ-1 and NMDARs (17Chen J.

In mouse brain slices, pretreatment with α2δ-1Tat peptide (1 μm for 30–60 min) abolished the TBS-induced increase in the amplitude of EPSPs in all MSNs (Fig. 3A). However, treatment with a Tat-fused scrambled control peptide (FGLGWQPWSLSFYLVWSGLILSVLHLIRSN) had no effect on the TBS-induced LTP of MSNs (Fig. 3A).

TBS reliably induced LTP in all MSNs recorded in brain slices obtained from WT mice. In contrast, TBS did not significantly change the amplitude of EPSPs in any of the MSNs examined in Cacna2d1-knockout mice (Fig. 3B). Taken together, these findings indicate that α2δ-1 plays a pivotal role in TBS-induced corticostriatal LTP. Because both α2δ-1 and NMDARs are required for TBS-induced LTP in the dorsomedial stratum, we determined to what extent α2δ-1 is involved in the increased synaptic NMDAR activity of MSNs during LTP induction. To assess the presynaptic NMDAR activity of MSNs associated with TBS-induced LTP, we recorded miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), which reflect quantal glutamate release from presynaptic terminals (29Zhou H.Y.

The mEPSCs of MSNs were recorded at 20–30 min (at which time LTP was stably induced by TBS; Figure 1, Figure 3) after TBS. In brain slices obtained from WT control mice, the frequency of mEPSCs of MSNs was low in the absence of TBS and was not significantly altered by bath application of 50 μm AP5 (Fig. 4, A–C). In contrast, TBS caused a large increase in the frequency, but not the amplitude, of mEPSCs in all MSNs of WT mice. In addition, this TBS-induced increase in mEPSC frequency was completely restored to the level of MSNs without TBS within 5 min after bath application of AP5 (Fig. 4, A–C). The baseline frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs in MSNs were comparable in WT and Cacna2d1-knockout mice. In brain slices from Cacna2d1-knockout mice, however, TBS failed to alter the frequency or"

Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is a multiprotein oligomer that promotes the maturation of IL-lβ and IL-18. Paricalcitol is reported to exert an antiinflammatory effect; however, there are no studies as to whether paricalcitol modulates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasome. We investigated the role of NLRP3 inflammasome in peritoneal EMT with an exploration of the effect of paricalcitol on oxidative stress, NLRP3 inflammasome, and EMT of mesothelial cells. TGF-βl-induced EMT in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) was associated with an up-regulation of NLRP3, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC), and ρrocasρase-1, with an increased production of IL-lβ and IL-18, which was ameliorated by small interfering (si)NLRP3, siASC, caspase inhibitors, or neutralizing antibodies for IL-lβ and IL-18. TGF-βl enhanced reactive oxygen species generation with an increase in NADPH oxidase (NOX) activity and mitochondrial NOX4 production. Paricalcitol alleviated TGF-βl-induced EMT and the NLRP3 inflammasome, which was associated with a down-regulation of NOX activity by interfering with p47phox and p22phox interaction and mitochondrial NOX4 production in HPMCs. Taken together, paricalcitol ameliorated EMT of HPMCs via modulating an NOX-dependent increase in the activity of NLRP3 inflammasome. Paricalcitol could be a novel approach to protect the peritoneum from the development of EMT and peritoneal fibrosis.—Ko, J., Kang, H.-J., Kim, D.-A., Ryu, E.-S., Yu, M., Lee, H., Lee, H.

https://openalex.org/W2896983836,"Large mammals that live in arid and/or desert environments can cope with seasonal and local variations in rainfall, food and climate1 by moving long distances, often without reliable water or food en route. The capacity of an animal for this long-distance travel is substantially dependent on the rate of energy utilization and thus heat production during locomotion—the cost of transport2–4. The terrestrial cost of transport is much higher than for flying (7.5 times) and swimming (20 times)4. Terrestrial migrants are usually large1–3 with anatomical specializations for economical locomotion5–9, because the cost of transport reduces with increasing size and limb length5–7. Here we used GPS-tracking collars10 with movement and environmental sensors to show that blue wildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus, 220 kg) that live in a hot arid environment in Northern Botswana walked up to 80 km over five days without drinking. They predominantly travelled during the day and locomotion appeared to be unaffected by temperature and humidity, although some behavioural thermoregulation was apparent. We measured power and efficiency of work production (mechanical work and heat production) during cyclic contractions of intact muscle biopsies from the forelimb flexor carpi ulnaris of wildebeest and domestic cows (Bos taurus, 760 kg), a comparable but relatively sedentary ruminant. The energetic costs of isometric contraction (activation and force generation) in wildebeest and cows were similar to published values for smaller mammals. Wildebeest muscle was substantially more efficient (62.6%) than the same muscle from much larger cows (41.8%) and comparable measurements that were obtained from smaller mammals (mouse (34%)11 and rabbit (27%)). We used the direct energetic measurements on intact muscle fibres to model the contribution of high working efficiency of wildebeest muscle to minimizing thermoregulatory challenges during their long migrations under hot arid conditions. Wildebeest, particularly during their long migrations under hot arid conditions, gain a considerable increase in range as a result of having highly efficient muscles."
https://openalex.org/W2897834047,"The causative role of G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway mutations in uveal melanoma (UM) has been well-established. Nearly all UMs bear an activating mutation in a GPCR pathway mediated by G proteins of the Gq/11 family, driving tumor initiation and possibly metastatic progression. Thus, targeting this pathway holds therapeutic promise for managing UM. However, direct targeting of oncogenic Gαq/11 mutants, present in ∼90% of UMs, is complicated by the belief that these mutants structurally resemble active Gαq/11 WT. This notion is solidly founded on previous studies characterizing Gα mutants in which a conserved catalytic glutamine (Gln-209 in Gαq) is replaced by leucine, which leads to GTPase function deficiency and constitutive activation. Whereas Q209L accounts for approximately half of GNAQ mutations in UM, Q209P is as frequent as Q209L and also promotes oncogenesis, but has not been characterized at the molecular level. Here, we characterized the biochemical and signaling properties of Gαq Q209P and found that it is also GTPase-deficient and activates downstream signaling as efficiently as Gαq Q209L. However, Gαq Q209P had distinct molecular and functional features, including in the switch II region of Gαq Q209P, which adopted a conformation different from that of Gαq Q209L or active WT Gαq, resulting in altered binding to effectors, Gβγ, and regulators of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins.

Unfortunately, attempts to pharmacologically target signaling pathways activated downstream of mutant Gαq/11 have not been successful, even when using multiple drugs in combination (7Carvajal R.D. Schwartz G.K. Tezel T. Marr B. Francis J.H. Nathan P.D. Metastatic disease from uveal melanoma: treatment options and future prospects.Br. J.

A likely explanation for the inefficiency of these approaches in blunting UM is that Gαq/11 activates a complex network of signaling effectors (14Chua V. Lapadula D. Randolph C. Benovic J.L. Wedegaertner P.B. Aplin A.E. Dysregulated GPCR signaling and therapeutic options in uveal melanoma.Mol.

Thus, direct inhibition of mutant Gαq/11 may be required to completely inhibit all the network components required to promote UM and achieve sufficient efficacy and therapeutic benefit. Direct targeting of oncogenic Gαq/11 mutants is a reasonable therapeutic approach, although it presents challenges, as these mutants are predicted to closely resemble active Gαq/11 WT. If so, strategies to inhibit mutant Gαq/11 would be expected to also cause inhibition of Gαq/11 WT, which could result in undesired side effects related to the major physiological functions of these G proteins (e.g. double Gαq/Gα11 knockout mice are nonviable (39Offermanns S.

Here, we present evidence that one of the most frequent Gαq mutants in UM, Q209P, displays properties different from that of active Gαq WT that could be leveraged to achieve specific targeting at the molecular level.

Whereas Gαq Q209L has been extensively characterized and used as a tool mutant to study Gq signaling for decades, Gαq Q209P has not been adequately studied.

Motivated by the fundamental gap in knowledge about the molecular properties of Gαq Q209P, we characterized this mutant by direct comparison with Gαq Q209L, to discover that while leading to signaling hyperactivation, as expected, it possessed structural features different from other active Gαq species, including active Gαq WT and the Gαq Q209L mutant. From a broader perspective, our findings reveal novel mechanistic insights into how G protein mutants lead to oncogenesis and into their possible suitability as direct targets for pharmacological intervention. To start characterizing the properties of Gαq Q209P, we compared its ability to bind effectors with that of Gαq Q209L or active Gαq WT. First, we investigated binding to GRK2. GRK2 was the first protein co-crystallized with active Gαq (41Tesmer V.M. Kawano T. Shankaranarayanan A. Kozasa T. Tesmer J.J. Snapshot of activated G proteins at the membrane: the Gαq-GRK2-Gβγ complex.Science. 2005; 310 (16339447): 1686-169010.1126/science.1118890Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Based on the atomic resolution structure of this complex, it was proposed, and subsequently confirmed, that GRK2 binding to Gαq has effector-like properties. We expressed Gαq WT, Gαq Q209L, and Gαq Q209P in HEK293T cells and carried out pulldowns with the RGS homology (RH) domain of GRK2 (aa 45–178) fused to GST. Cell lysis and pulldowns were carried out rapidly (∼1.5 h from lysis to protein complex elution) at 4 °C in a buffer without Mg2+ supplemented with EDTA to minimize GTP hydrolysis during the assay. As a positive control, we also included a condition in which lysates of cells expressing Gαq WT were supplemented with Mg·AlF4−, which mimics the GTP-bound transition state of the G protein that binds with high affinity to effectors. As expected, Gαq WT loaded with Mg·AlF4− bound robustly to GRK2, whereas Gαq WT in the absence of Mg·AlF4−, presumably in its GDP-bound inactive conformation, did not (Fig. 1A). Also, as expected, Gαq Q209L bound to GRK2 as much as Gαq WT supplemented with Mg·AlF4−, which is consistent with its predicted constitutive GTP-bound status. Surprisingly, Gαq"

These structures, termed steric zippers, constitute the spines of amyloid fibrils.

We demonstrate that there are at least two such segments and that each one can drive amyloid fibril assembly independently of the other. Our analysis revealed that peptides derived from these segments form steric zippers featuring a typical dry interface with high-surface complementarity and occupy the same spatial location of the Greek-key immunoglobulin fold in both λ and κ variable domains. Of note, some predicted steric-zipper segments did not form amyloid fibrils or assembled into fibrils only when removed from the whole protein. We conclude that steric-zipper propensity must be experimentally validated and that the two segments identified here may represent therapeutic targets.

Moreover, screening uptake and disease outcomes are generally worse in rural areas as well as in the HIV positive population. Efforts directed at increasing the screening rates are important in order to decrease cancer-related morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to explore the barriers to women with HIV accessing cervical cancer screening in Kgatleng district, Botswana. Methods A phenomenological qualitative study utilising semi-structured interviews with fourteen HIV positive women, selected by purposive sampling. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and the 5-steps of the framework method, assisted by Atlas-ti software, was used for qualitative data analysis. Results Contextual factors included distance, public transport issues and work commitments. Health system factors highlighted unavailability of results, inconsistent appointment systems, long queues and equipment shortages and poor patient-centred communication skills, particularly skills in explanation and planning. Patient factors identified were lack of knowledge of cervical cancer, benefits of screening, effectiveness of treatment, as well as personal fears and misconceptions. Conclusion Cervical cancer screening was poorly accessed due to a weak primary care system, insufficient health promotion and information as well as poor communication skills. These issues could be partly addressed by considering alternative technology and one-stop models of testing and treating."

However, how butenolides regulate these processes is poorly investigated because of obstacles in obtaining these signaling molecules. This study reports the identification of a butenolide-type signaling system for nikkomycin biosynthesis in Streptomyces ansochromogenes with distinct features. We identified a gene cluster, sab, consisting of three genes, sabAPD, for butenolide biosynthesis and two regulator genes, sabR1 and sabR2, and characterized three butenolides (SAB1, -2, and -3) by heterologous expression of sabAPD. sabA disruption abolished nikkomycin production, which could be restored by the addition of SABs or by deletion of sabR1 in ΔsabA. Electrophoretic mobility-shift assays and transcriptional analyses indicated that SabR1 indirectly represses the transcription of nikkomycin biosynthetic genes, but directly represses sabA and sabR1. In the presence of SABs, the SabR1 transcriptional regulator dissociated from its target genes, verifying that SabR1 is the cognate receptor of SABs. Genome-wide scanning with the conserved SabR1-binding sequence revealed another SabR1 target gene, cprC, whose transcription was strongly repressed by SabR1. Intriguingly, CprC positively regulated the pleiotropic regulatory gene adpA by binding to its promoter and, in turn, activated nikkomycin biosynthesis. This is the first report that butenolide-type signaling molecules and their cognate receptor SabR1 can regulate adpA via a newly identified activator, CprC, to control nikkomycin production.

https://openalex.org/W2898101482,"Although most countries in the WHO European Region were verified in 2017 as having interrupted endemic measles transmission, nine countries were still endemic. Among these, Italy accounted for the second highest number of measles cases reported in Europe in 2017. The elimination of measles is verified at national level by each country's National Verification Committee (NVC) through the production of an Annual Status Update (ASU). Since in Italy decentralization has led to an inhomogeneous implementation of immunization strategies among the 21 administrative Regions, the Italian NVC proposed that measles elimination should also be documented at the subnational level through regional ASUs and Synthetic Regional Reports (SRRs). The regional ASUs and the SRRs for 2014, 2015 and 2016 were produced and appraised by the NVC to evaluate the Regions' performances in each individual year as well as over the whole period. A specific analysis of vaccination coverage, including official immunization data for 2017, was performed. Moreover, the measles epidemic of 2017 was examined. Firstly, in the period 2014-2016, low immunization rates were registered in most Regions. Sixty-three per cent of southern Regions reported rates below the national mean and an overall low-quality performance. The approval of Italy's mandatory vaccination law in 2017 resulted in a marked increase in vaccination coverage; however, this increase was not homogeneous among Regions. Secondly, more than 50% of Regions did not report any supplemental immunization activity (SIA) for the period 2014-2016. Thirdly, from 2014 to 2016, fewer than one-third of Regions improved their reporting of outbreaks. Finally, over the study period, only two Regions reached the target required by the WHO for measles laboratory investigations. In countries with decentralized health policies, subnational monitoring can help identify local barriers to measles elimination. In Italy it has highlighted the need for further SIAs and a stronger surveillance system."

Here, we show that retinaldehyde adducts (bisretinoid fluorophores) that form in photoreceptor outer segments occupy the unphagocytosed outer-segment debris that accumulates in Mertk−/− mice. Bisretinoids measured by HPLC were elevated in Mertk−/− mice compared with WT animals. Bisretinoids were also more abundant in albino Mertk−/− mice expressing leucine at position 450 of the isomerase RPE65 (Rpe65-Leu450) rather than the variant methionine (Rpe65-450Met) that yields lower bisretinoid levels. In Royal College of Surgeons rats having dysfunctional Mertk, bisretinoids were higher than in WT rats. Intensities of in vivo fundus autofluorescence were higher in Mertk−/− mice than in WT mice and peaked earlier in albino Mertk−/−/Rpe65-Leu450 mice than in albino Mertk−/−/Rpe65-450Met mice. Of note, the rate of photoreceptor cell degeneration was more rapid in albino Mertk−/− mice exposed to higher levels of intraocular light (albino versus pigmented mice) and in mice carrying Rpe65-Leu450 than in Rpe65-450Met mice, revealing a link between bisretinoid accumulation and light-mediated acceleration of photoreceptor cell degeneration. In conclusion, the light sensitivity of photoreceptor cell degeneration arising from Mertk deficiency is consistent with the known phototoxicity of bisretinoids. The receptor tyrosine kinase Mer is expressed by retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and participates in photoreceptor outer-segment phagocytosis, a process enabling membrane renewal.

Loss of the photoreceptor cells in both the mouse and rat models is reflected in thinning of the outer nuclear layer (ONL); in the pink-eyed tan hooded RCS rats, ONL thickness is reduced by 50% at 1 month of age (6LaVail M.M.

In the pink-eyed and albino rats, the outer-segment debris begins to disappear in posterior central retina at around postnatal day 55, and by day 96, most is gone posteriorly. In healthy and diseased retina, autofluorescent vitamin A–aldehyde adducts that form in photoreceptor outer segments belong to the bisretinoid family of compounds that are internalized by RPE within phagocytosed outer-segment membranes. These fluorophores constitute the lipofuscin of RPE. The long-wavelength autofluorescence exhibited by bisretinoids is readily explained by the extensive systems of conjugated double bonds that populate the vitamin A–aldehyde (A2)-derived side arms of the molecules. The bisretinoid pigments of RPE lipofuscin in humans and rodents include A2E, iso-A2E, all-trans-retinal dimer, A2GPE, and all-trans-retinal dimer–phosphatidylethanolamine (19Sparrow J.R.

The biosynthesis of bisretinoid occurs in photoreceptor outer segments with nonenzymatic condensation reactions between all-trans-retinaldehyde and phosphatidylethanolamine; the 11-cis isomer of retinaldehyde is the light-absorbing chromophore of rhodopsin. For the biosynthesis of A2E, the best known of the bisretinoid fluorophores, the immediate precursor is the phosphatidyl-pyridinium compound A2PE that we have identified in isolated photoreceptor outer segments (29Ben-Shabat S.

The outer-segment debris that accumulates in the RCS rat retina is considered to figure prominently in events leading to photoreceptor cell degeneration, and although the precise mechanisms are not known, several processes have been proposed. For instance, the debris has been suggested to serve as a diffusion barrier (49Herron W.L. Riegel B.W. Myers O.E. Rubin M.L. Retinal dystrophy in the rat–a pigment epithelial disease.Invest.

However, these mechanisms do not address the composition of the outer-segment debris or its ability to confer light sensitivity. The Mertk−/− mouse provides an excellent platform for assessing the impact of bisretinoids on the health of the photoreceptor cells in which they form. To examine the molecular composition of the outer-segment debris and to explore the cause of photoreceptor cell degeneration in the presence of Mertk mutations, we generated mice carrying null mutations in Mertk in albino and pigmented mice and in mice carrying the Rpe65 amino acid variant (leucine or methionine at residue 450) that confers different levels of bisretinoid formation (22Kim S.R. Fishkin N. Kong J. Nakanishi K. Allikmets R. Sparrow J.R. The Rpe65 Leu450Met variant is associated with reduced levels of the RPE lipofuscin fluorophores A2E and iso-A2E.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Here, we demonstrate that bisretinoid fluorophores are the source of autofluorescence in the photoreceptor cell debris that accumulates in Mertk−/− mice, and we provide evidence that these photoreactive compounds are linked to mechanisms whereby light aggravates photoreceptor cell degeneration in the Mertk−/− mouse. We imaged in vivo fundus autofluorescence noninvasively using instrumentation comparable with that used clinically. Fundus autofluorescence captured using 488-nm excitation (short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence; SW-AF) originates primarily from the bisretinoids that are amassed in retina as lipofuscin (48Sparrow J.R. Wu Y. Nagasaki T. Yoon K.D. Yamamoto K. Zhou J. Fundus autofluorescence and the bisretinoids of retina.Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. 2010; 9 (20862444): 1480-148910.1039/c0pp00207kCrossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). With SW-AF imaging of Mertk−/− mice at 4 and 5 weeks of age, the fundus appeared relatively uniform in all mice (54 images, 27 mice) (Fig. 1A). At 6 weeks of age in the albino Mertk−/− mice (8 of 9 Rpe65-450Met; 8 of 8 Rpe65-Leu450), dark and bright mottling of the fundus was visible. Dark patchiness was even more pronounced in the albino Mertk−/−/Rpe65-Leu450 mice (10 of 12) at 8 weeks, whereas in the agouti Mertk−/−/Rpe65-450Met mice (6 of 6), distinct areas of hyperautofluorescence were observed inferiorly (Fig. 1A). In all (10 of 10) albino Mertk−/−/Rpe65-Leu450 mice at 12 weeks of age, the optic nerve head (ONH) and vasculature were noticeably indistinct. Hyperautofluorescent puncta were also a feature of the SW-AF images in all mouse lines beginning as early as 8 weeks of age; because ocular pigmentation provides a dark background, the puncta were particularly pronounced in agouti Mertk−/−/Rpe65-450Met mice and in some eyes persisted at ages of 12 (Fig. 1A), 15 (not shown), and 24 (Fig. 1B) weeks.

https://openalex.org/W2951690425,"Drosophila melanogaster are known to live in a social but cryptic world of touch and odours, but the extent to which they can perceive and integrate static visual information is a hotly debated topic. Some researchers fixate on the limited resolution of D. melanogaster’s optics, others on their seemingly identical appearance; yet there is evidence of individual recognition and surprising visual learning in flies. Here, we apply machine learning and show that individual D. melanogaster are visually distinct. We also use the striking similarity of Drosophila’s visual system to current convolutional neural networks to theoretically investigate D. melanogaster’s capacity for visual understanding. We find that, despite their limited optical resolution, D. melanogaster’s neuronal architecture has the capability to extract and encode a rich feature set that allows flies to re-identify individual conspecifics with surprising accuracy. These experiments provide a proof of principle that Drosophila inhabit a much more complex visual world than previously appreciated."

This physiological function of MBPs has generated significant interest in understanding the mechanisms by which these proteins read and interpret DNA methylation signals. Zinc finger and BTB domain–containing 38 (ZBTB38) represents one member of the zinc finger (ZF) family of MBPs. We recently demonstrated that the C-terminal ZFs of ZBTB38 exhibit methyl-selective DNA binding within the ((A/G)TmCG(G/A)(mC/T)(G/A)) context both in vitro and within cells. Here we report the crystal structure of the first four C-terminal ZBTB38 ZFs (ZFs 6–9) in complex with the previously identified methylated consensus sequence at 1.75 Å resolution. From the structure, methyl-selective binding is preferentially localized at the 5′ mCpG site of the bound DNA, which is facilitated through a series of base-specific interactions from residues within the α-helices of ZF7 and ZF8. ZF6 and ZF9 primarily stabilize ZF7 and ZF8 to facilitate the core base–specific interactions. Further structural and biochemical analyses, including solution NMR spectroscopy and electrophoretic mobility gel shift assays, revealed that the C-terminal ZFs of ZBTB38 utilize an alternative mode of mCpG recognition from the ZF MBPs structurally evaluated to date. Combined, these findings provide insight into the mechanism by which this ZF domain of ZBTB38 selectively recognizes methylated CpG sites and expands our understanding of how ZF-containing proteins can interpret this essential epigenetic mark.

These findings have significant implications for delineating the overall biological function of ZBTB38, given that its transcriptional activities have been linked to a number of core cellular processes such as cellular proliferation (38Nishii T.

Using a hybrid biophysical methodology and collective structural insight from available ZF–methylated DNA structures, we previously presented an atomistic model in which it was proposed that a key arginine common to ZF MBPs was replaced with a lysine (Lys-1055) in mCpG recognition (37Pozner A. Hudson N.O. Trewhella J. Terooatea T.W. Miller S.A. Buck-Koehntop B.A. The C-terminal zinc fingers of ZBTB38 are novel selective readers of DNA methylation.J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 (29287967): 258-27110.1016/j.jmb.2017.12.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Here, using a combination of high-resolution structural and biochemical analyses, we characterize the interactions of the C-terminal ZBTB38 ZFs in complex with its methylated consensus motif, termed the methylated C-terminal ZBTB38 binding sequence (mCZ38BS). From this investigation, it was determined that Lys-1055 does function as an arginine surrogate in mCpG binding. This finding provides the first evidence that alternative modes of mCpG recognition by ZF MBPs may be utilized and expands our understanding of the mechanisms by which this essential epigenetic mark is read. We determined previously that the C-terminal ZBTB38 ZFs 7–9 were necessary and sufficient for methyl-selective DNA recognition (37Pozner A. Hudson N.O. Trewhella J. Terooatea T.W. Miller S.A. Buck-Koehntop B.A. The C-terminal zinc fingers of ZBTB38 are novel selective readers of DNA methylation.J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 (29287967): 258-27110.1016/j.jmb.2017.12.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, it was also demonstrated that the highest-affinity binding was achieved in the presence of all five C-terminal ZFs (ZFs 6–10), suggesting that either or both ZF6 and ZF10 may contribute to the overall stability of the protein:DNA interaction. Thus, initial attempts to crystallize the C-terminal ZFs of ZBTB38 with the mCZ38BS focused on utilizing residues 1006–1153, encompassing ZFs 6–10 (Fig. 1A). Preliminary screening of crystallization conditions yielded several low-resolution diffracting crystals. Further optimization attempts, including varying the DNA length and introducing overhangs, failed to produce crystals with better than 7 Å diffraction despite obtaining a number of crystals with multiple morphologies. Given these results, we postulated that removal of ZF6 or ZF10 might improve crystallization for this protein:DNA complex. Thus, we designed C-terminal constructs including ZFs 6–9 (residues 1006–1124) or ZFs 7–10 (residues 1034–1153) and assessed the consequence of removing either of these ZFs on mCZ38BS recognition (Fig. 1). Comparative 1H-15N heteronuclear single-quantum coherence (HSQC) analysis of free ZFs 6–9 and 7–10 showed that each protein adopted well-folded structural domains (Fig. 1B). Further, a large fraction of the resonances for ZFs 6–9 and 7–10 each superimposed with respective resonances from ZFs 6–10, indicating that the domain folds were preserved (Fig. 1B). In the presence of mCZ38BS, both ZFs 6–10 and 6–9 produced well-resolved spectra indicative of high-affinity binding interactions (Fig. 1C). Moreover, the majority of resonances outside of the random coil region observed for the ZF 6–10:mCZ38BS complex spectrum were largely recapitulated in the ZF 6–9:mCZ38BS complex spectrum, indicating similar structures for the protein: DNA complexes. In contrast, ZFs 7–10 in complex with the mCZ38BS resulted in significant signal loss for many resonances, suggestive of a much weaker binding interaction (Fig. 1C). Consistent with the solution NMR observations, ZFs 6–10 and 6–9 had nearly identical low nanomolar binding affinities (Kd values of ∼5 nm) for mCZ38BS recognition, whereas ZFs 7–10 exhibited ∼8-fold weaker binding (Fig. 1D and Fig. S1A). This finding was also in agreement with our previously proposed atomistic model, where the α-helices of ZFs 6–9 could be readily positioned along the major groove of the DNA, whereas the exact positioning of ZF10 remained indeterminant (37Pozner A. Hudson N.O. Trewhella J. Terooatea T.W. Miller S.A. Buck-Koehntop B.A. The C-terminal zinc fingers of ZBTB38 are novel selective readers of DNA methylation.J. Mol. Biol. 2018; 430 (29287967): 258-27110.1016/j.jmb.2017.12.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Although these observations do not fully preclude ZF10 from interacting nonspecifically with DNA, it is possible that another primary physiological role for this ZF domain exists. Indeed, it was shown that the region of ZBTB38 encompassing the C-terminal ZFs can also participate in protein:protein interactions (40Miotto B. Chibi M. Xie P. Koundrioukoff S. Moolman-Smook H. Pugh D. Debatisse M. He F. Zhang L. Defossez P.-A. The RBBP6/ZBTB38/MCM10 axis regulates DNA replication and common fragile site stability.Cell Rep. 2014; 7 (24726359): 575-58710.1016/j.celrep.2014.03.030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Combined, these findings suggest that ZBTB38 ZFs 6–9 constitute the minimal subset of ZFs necessary for high-affinity DNA recognition. ZBTB38 ZFs 6–9 (Fig. 2A) were co-crystallized with an 18-bp oligonucleotide sequence containing the previously determined high-affinity mCZ38BS motif (ATmCGGmCG) (37Pozner A. Hudson N.O. Trewhella J. Terooatea T.W. Miller S.A. Buck-Koehntop B.A. The C-terminal zinc fingers of ZBTB38 are novel selective readers of DNA methylation.J. Mol.

Crystallization of the complexes succeeded with a shorter oligonucleotide duplex than what was used for the EMSA and initial solution NMR experiments (Table S1). No discernable differences in protein resonance chemical shifts were observed by solution NMR in complexation with either the 21-mer or 18-mer version of the mCZ38BS. The protein:DNA complex crystallized into space group C222(1), with one complex per asymmetric unit, and the structure was determined at a resolution of 1.75 Å (Table 1). Atomic positioning was afforded for all base atoms within the mCZ38BS and ZBTB38 residues 1009–1120, which excludes three and four flexible residues at the N and C termini, respectively.Table 1X-ray diffraction data collection and refinement statisticsParametersZBTB38 ZF 6–9:mCZ38BSZBTB38 ZF 6–9_K1055R:mCZ38BSData collectionBeamlineSSRL 12-2SSRL 12-2Wavelength (Å)0.97950.9795Space groupC222 (1)C222 (1)Unit cell parametersa, b, c (Å)70.80, 77.27, 103.7670.56, 77.61, 103.09Resolution range (Å)40.00–1.75 (1.81–1.75)38.80–1.59 (1.62–1.59)Observed reflections193,907487,692Unique reflections29,10837,856Redundancy6.712.9Completeness (%)99.8 (99.8)99.3 (88.8)Mosaicity (°)0.680.26<I>/σ(I)4.9 (0.8)9.4 (0.9)CC½(0.572)(0.610)RefinementResolution range (Å)21.54–1.75 (1.81–1.75)35.40–1.60 (1.61–1.60)No. of reflections29,04337,492No. of reflections in Rfree set2,8363,286Rwork0.1860 (0.2695)0.1939 (0.3029)Rfree0.2112 (0.3055)0.2183 (0.3238)RMSD bonds/angles (Å/°)0.007/1.8000.007/1.041No. of atomsProtein/DNA16791671Water152202Others4 (Zn+2)4 (Zn+2)B-factors (Å2)Protein/DNA36.127.0Water38.532.3Others30.624.0Ramachandran favored (%)98.299.1 Open table in a new tab All four of the Cys2His2 ZFs adopt the canonical ββα zinc finger fold and wrap around the DNA with their α-helices oriented toward the major groove (Fig. 2, A and B). However, only ZF7 and ZF8 participate in base-specific DNA interactions, which are concentrated at the three core T8:A29, mC9:G28, and G10:mC27 base steps (Fig. 2C and Table S2). The α-helix of ZF6 spans the major groove and is primarily anchored through a series of electrostatic and direct hydrogen-bonding interactions with the phosphate backbone as well as by van der Waals contacts with the sugar rings on both DNA strands (Fig. 2C, Fig. S2A, and Table S2). These contacts from ZF6 are positioned toward the 5′ and 3′ ends of the coding and noncoding strands, respectively. ZF9 has an extended α-helix relative to ZFs 6–8, the C-terminal end of which orients away from the major groove of the DNA. This affords accumulation of a hydration layer within the corresponding major groove region of the DNA (Fig. S2B). Similar to ZF6, the N-terminal end of the ZF9 α-helix contributes analogous backbone interactions along both DNA strands toward the 3′ and 5′ ends of the coding and noncoding strands, respectively (Fig. 2C, Fig. S2C, and Table S2). Both ZF6 and ZF9 also contribute interactions between residues along their respective α-helices (Met-1027 and Ser-1107) and the C5-methyl groups of thymine bases found along the noncoding strand (T30 and T22) (Fig. 2C, Fig. S2A, and Fig. S2C and Table S2). The side-chain interactions observed between the Cγ-methyl of Met-1027 (Fig. S1A) and the C5-methyl of T30 in conjunction with a contact between the Cγ2-methyl of Val-1049 (ZF7) and the C5-methyl of T30 may explain the slight observed preference for having an A:T step in the first position of the mCZ38BS (37Pozner A.

Overall, it appears that ZFs 6 and 9 primarily function to stabilize ZF7 and ZF8 for making core base–specific interactions. Of the high-resolution structures currently available for ZF MBPs in complex with methylated DNA, the ZBTB38 ZF 6–9:mCZ38BS complex structure most resembles the ZBTB33:mDNA structures (19Buck-Koehntop B.A. Stanfield R.L.

Further, although the ZBTB33 methylated consensus motif contains two consecutive mCpG (mCpGmCpG) sites, structural and biochemical evidence has established that methyl sensitivity is primarily conferred by base-specific contacts at the 5′ mCpG, whereas methylation at the 3′ mCpG is less essential (19Buck-Koehntop B.A. Stanfield R.L.

Similarly, the C-terminal ZBTB38 ZFs preferentially recognize the 5′ mCpG site within the mCZ38BS (7ATmCGGmCG13) (37Pozner A. Hudson N.O. Trewhella J. Terooatea T.W. Miller S.A.

Although optimal binding between the ZBTB38 C-terminal ZFs and the mCZ38BS was observed when both CpG sites were methylated, biochemical analysis demonstrated that the methylation status of the 3′ mCpG contributed less to the overall binding interaction (37Pozner A.

Here we used standard measures of subjective experiences such as ownership, agency and presence to investigate whether prolonged exposure to the delay, and thus the possibility to adapt to it, leads to the recovery of the qualitative experience of VR. Participants performed a target-tracking task in a Virtual Reality environment. We measured the participants’ tracking performance in terms of spatial and temporal errors with respect to the target in both No-Delay and Delay conditions. Additionally, participants rated their sense of “ownership” of holding a virtual tool, agency and presence on each trial using sliding scales. These single trial ratings were compared to the results of the more traditional questionnaires for ownership and agency and presence for both No-Delay and Delay conditions. We found that the participants’ sliding scales ratings corresponded very well to the scores obtained from the traditional questionnaires. Moreover, not only did participants behaviourally adapt to the delay, their ratings of ownership and agency significantly improved with prolonged exposure to the delay. Together the results suggest a tight link between the ability to perform a behavioural task and the subjective ratings of ownership and agency in virtual reality."
https://openalex.org/W2896666172,"While great advances have been achieved regarding the genetic basis of colorectal cancer, the complex role of cell–cell communication and cytokine-induced signaling during its pathogenesis remains less understood. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (Stat6) is the main transcription factor of interleukin-4 (IL-4) signaling and its participation in the development of various tumor types has been already reported. Here we aimed to examine the contribution of Stat6 in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) in mouse models of intestinal carcinogenesis. Wild-type (WT), Stat6 knockout (Stat6−/−), and intestinal epithelial cell-specific IL-4Rα knockout (Il-4rαΔIEC) mice were subjected to colitis-associated (AOM/DSS) and colitis-independent (sporadic) carcinogenesis. IEC proliferation, apoptosis and RNA expression were evaluated by immunohistochemical, immunoblot, and RT-PCR analysis. We found that Stat6−/− mice developed more tumors in the colitis-associated carcinogenesis model. This was accompanied by a more pronounced inflammatory response during colitis and an elevated Stat3-dependent proliferation of IEC. Increased sensitivity to DSS-induced colitis was caused by elevated cell death in response to the initial carcinogen exposure as Stat6 deficiency led to increased chromatin compaction affecting DNA damage response in IEC upon treatment with alkylating agents independently of IL-4Rα engagement. Thus, loss of Stat6 caused more severe colitis and increased tumor load, however loss-of-initiated Stat6−/− IEC prevented tumor formation in the absence of overt inflammation. Our data unravel unexpected IL-4-independent functions of Stat6 in chromatin compaction in intestinal epithelial cells ultimately providing both tumor suppressive as well as tumor promoting effects in different models of intestinal tumorigenesis."

We use baseline assessments from a cluster randomized controlled trial to examine the prevalence of school corporal punishment, by gender, and the relationship to levels of peer violence at school, parent corporal punishment, youth food security and youth academic performance and school attendance in Pakistan. Forty homogenous public schools in the urban city of Hyderabad, Pakistan were chosen for randomization into the trial evaluating a youth violence prevention intervention. 1752 6th graders, age 11–14 years, were selected as the target population. Since schools are segregated by gender in Pakistan, data are from interviews in 20 boys’ schools and 20 girls’ schools. Overall, 91.4% of boys and 60.9% of girls reported corporal punishment at school in the previous 4 weeks and 60.3% of boys had been physically punished at home in the past 4 weeks compared to 37.1% of girls. Structural equation modeling revealed one direct pathway for both boys and girls from food insecurity to corporal punishment at school while indirect pathways were mediated by depression, the number of days missed from school and school performance and for boys also by engagement in peer violence. Exposure to corporal punishment in school and from parents differs by gender, but in both boys and girls poverty in the form of food insecurity was an important risk factor, with the result that poorer children are victimized more by adults."

In this study, using mouse and human cell lines along with in vitro splicing assays, we investigated whether these components contribute to XBP1 splicing during ER stress. We found that the mammalian 2′-phosphotransferase Trpt1 does not contribute to XBP1 splicing even in the absence of RtcB. Instead, we found that 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNP) suppresses RtcB-mediated XBP1 splicing by hydrolyzing 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate into 2′-phosphate on the cleaved exon termini. By contrast, RNA 3′-terminal cyclase (RtcA), which converts 2′-phosphate back to 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, facilitated XBP1 splicing by increasing the number of compatible RNA termini for RtcB.

In this study, using mouse and human cell lines along with in vitro splicing assays, we investigated whether these components contribute to XBP1 splicing during ER stress. We found that the mammalian 2′-phosphotransferase Trpt1 does not contribute to XBP1 splicing even in the absence of RtcB. Instead, we found that 2′,3′-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CNP) suppresses RtcB-mediated XBP1 splicing by hydrolyzing 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate into 2′-phosphate on the cleaved exon termini. By contrast, RNA 3′-terminal cyclase (RtcA), which converts 2′-phosphate back to 2′,3′-cyclic phosphate, facilitated XBP1 splicing by increasing the number of compatible RNA termini for RtcB. Taken together, our results provide evidence that CNP and RtcA fine-tune XBP1 output during ER stress."
https://openalex.org/W2898522301,"Clinical management of children and youth with cerebral palsy (CP) is increasingly supported by computerized gait analysis. Methods have been developed to reduce the complexity of interpreting biomechanical data and quantify meaningful movement patterns. However, few methods are inclusive of multiple joints and planes of motion, and consider the entire duration of gait phases; potentially limiting insight into this heterogeneous pathology. The objective of this study was to assess the implementation of k-means clustering to determine clusters of participants with CP based on multi-joint gait kinematics.Barefoot walking kinematics were analyzed for a historical cohort (2007-2015) of 37 male and female children and youth with spastic diplegic CP [male n = 21; female n = 16; median age = 12 (range 5-25) years; Gross Motor Function Classification System Level I n = 17 and Level II n = 20]. Mean stance phase hip (sagittal, coronal, transverse), knee (sagittal), and ankle (sagittal) kinematics were time (101 data points), mean and range normalized. Normalized kinematics data vectors (505 data points) for all participants were then combined in a single data matrix M (37x505 data points). K-means clustering was conducted 10 times for all data in M (2-5 seeds, 50 repetitions). Cluster quality was assessed using the mean Silhouette value ([Formula: see text]) and cluster repeatability. The mean kinematic patterns of each cluster were explored with respect to a dataset of normally developing (ND) children using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM, alpha 0.05). Differences in potentially confounding variables (age, height, weight, walking speed) between clusters (C) were assessed individually in SPSS (IBM, USA) using Kruskal-Wallis H tests (alpha 0.05).Four clusters (n1 = 5, n2 = 12, n3 = 12, n4 = 8) provided the largest possible data separation based on high cluster repeatability (96.8% across 10 repetitions) and comparatively greater cluster quality [[Formula: see text] (SD), 0.275 (0.152)]. Participant data with low cluster quality values displayed a tendency toward lower cluster allocation repeatability. Distinct kinematic differences between clusters and ND data were observable. Specifically, C1 displayed a unique continuous hip abduction and external rotation pattern. In contrast, participants in C2 moved from hip adduction (loading response) to abduction (mid to terminal stance) and featured a unique ankle plantarflexor pattern during pre-swing. C3 was characterized by gait deviations in the sagittal plane of the hip, knee and ankle only. C4 displayed evidence for the most substantial hip and knee extension, and ankle plantarflexion deficit from midstance to pre-swing.K-means clustering enabled the determination of up to four kinematic clusters of individuals with spastic diplegic CP using multi-joint angles without a priori data reduction. A cluster boundary effect was demonstrated by the Silhouette value, where data with values approaching zero were more likely to change cluster allocation. Exploratory analyses using SPM revealed significant differences across joints and between clusters indicating the formation of clinically meaningful clusters. Further work is needed to determine the effects of including further topographical classifications of CP, additional biomechanical data, and the sensitivity to clinical interventions to assess the potential for informing clinical decision-making."

The aim of this paper is to shed light on the implementation of a strategic organizational structure for patient engagement in mental health by examining why and how to implement a structure, the organizational and environmental factors that facilitate or limit the process, and the perceived consequences of the implementation. Method This paper evaluates the implementation of a strategic committee for patient engagement in a mental healthcare organization in Montreal (Quebec, Canada). The research was designed as a qualitative single case study using a deductive approach by means of a conceptual framework. Data sources consisted in ten semi-structured interviews, three focus groups, and organizational documents. Results The strategic committee for patient engagement was implemented as a means to formalize patient partner participation, following the introduction of a vision of full citizenship. Important aspects of its implementation included its composition and role, the elaboration of a framework for patient partner participation, and finally, ongoing application and evaluation of the framework. Several facilitating factors were identified, including executive management support, leadership, and a vision behind the participation. Limiting factors mainly consisted of resistance towards patient participation and the existence of stigma. Consequences included increased and improved patient engagement, as well as reduced stigma within the organization. Conclusion This study shows that the implementation of a strategic organizational structure for patient engagement is comprehensive. It further shows the importance of a vision and an articulate leadership involving several actors. Further research is needed regarding the impact of this type of strategic structure on a clinical level."

https://openalex.org/W2898126017,"We previously reported that transcription of the human IL1B gene, encoding the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 1β, depends on long-distance chromatin looping that is stabilized by a mutual interaction between the DNA-binding domains (DBDs) of two transcription factors: Spi1 proto-oncogene at the promoter and CCAAT enhancer–binding protein (C/EBPβ) at a far-upstream enhancer. We have also reported that the C-terminal tail sequence beyond the C/EBPβ leucine zipper is critical for its association with Spi1 via an exposed residue (Arg-232) located within a pocket at one end of the Spi1 DNA-recognition helix. Here, combining in vitro interaction studies with computational docking and molecular dynamics of existing X-ray structures for the Spi1 and C/EBPβ DBDs, along with the C/EBPβ C-terminal tail sequence, we found that the tail sequence is intimately associated with Arg-232 of Spi1. The Arg-232 pocket was computationally screened for small-molecule binding aimed at IL1B transcription inhibition, yielding l-arginine, a known anti-inflammatory amino acid, revealing a potential for disrupting the C/EBPβ–Spi1 interaction. As evaluated by ChIP, cultured lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated THP-1 cells incubated with l-arginine had significantly decreased IL1B transcription and reduced C/EBPβ’s association with Spi1 on the IL1B promoter. No significant change was observed in direct binding of either Spi1 or C/EBPβ to cognate DNA and in transcription of the C/EBPβ-dependent IL6 gene in the same cells. These results support the notion that disordered sequences extending from a leucine zipper can mediate protein–protein interactions and can serve as druggable targets for regulating gene promoter activity.

https://openalex.org/W2898136645,"Stress has been demonstrated to play an important role in hair follicle function and the pathogenesis of some hair disorders. The central hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is activated by stress stimuli, synthesizes and releases various components and eventually induces the pathogenesis and recurrence of peripheral diseases. Our aim is to compare the different responses under exposure of stress in hair follicle function among different mouse strains, and to detect the involvement of the central HPA axis after stress in hair follicle growth and melanogenesis. In this study, we exposed different mouse strains (C57BL/6, CBA/J, C3H/HeN, BALB/c and ICR) to a 21-day chronic restraint stress protocol and selected C57BL/6, CBA/J and BALB/c mice for further study because of their significant behavioral alterations. Then, we evaluated and compared the different responses and sensitivity to chronic restraint stress in hair follicle function and central HPA axis among the selected strains. The results showed that expression of POMC, CRF and GR mRNA and protein and serum levels of corticosterone were inhibited in response to stress. These findings suggested that chronic restraint stress may inhibit hair follicle growth and melanogenesis via regulating the key elements of the central HPA axis. In addition, the results revealed different mouse strains exhibit different responses in the central HPA axis and hair follicle after stress exposure. C57BL/6 might be the most sensitive strain among the three strains tested as well as an appropriate strain to study possible pathophysiological mechanisms by which the nervous system influences skin function and screen dermatological drugs suitable for psychotherapy. We believe the current study will provide some useful information for researchers who are interested in the bidirectional communication between the nervous and skin systems and the management of stress-induced cutaneous diseases."

https://openalex.org/W2898354611,"Little is known about the evaluation of ecological restoration measures using species distribution models (SDMs) at the microscale. This study investigated the effect of arbor–bush–herb mixed plantation (ABHMP) on the potential distribution of D. dichotoma using SDMs in the typical microtopographies of the red soil hilly region of China. We examined D. dichotoma growth, microtopography, and environment-related factors at the microscale. The percentages of microtopographies and D. dichotoma physiology factors increased in the order from the valley to the ridge in the D. dichotoma patches. The valley had milder temperatures, higher humidity, and more fertile soil than the ridge in the gullies. Microclimate factors were the most critical environmental factors affecting the distribution of D. dichotoma, followed by soil factors, whereas the microtopography factors had only a marginal effect. The predicted potential distribution of D. dichotoma under the ABHMP scenario was nearly 3-fold higher than the current distribution, and the suitable area was located mostly in the level trenches and the valley. ABHMP had a strong effect on the potential distribution of D. dichotoma, and SDMs proved to be a valuable tool for assessing ecological restoration measures at the microscale."
https://openalex.org/W2898387989,"Dinoflagellates possess some of the largest known genomes. However, the study of their chromosomes is complicated by their similar size and their inability to be distinguished by traditional banding techniques. Dinoflagellate chromosomes lack nucleosomes and are present in a liquid crystalline state. In addition, approaches such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are problematic because chromosomes are difficult to isolate from the nuclear membrane, which in dinoflagellates remains intact, also during mitosis. Here we describe a novel, reliable and effective technique to study dinoflagellate chromosomes by physical mapping of repetitive DNA sequences in chromosomes in suspension (FISH-IS), rather than on a microscope slide. A suspension of non-fixed chromosomes was achieved by lysing the cells and destabilizing the nuclear envelope. This treatment resulted in the release of the permanently condensed chromosomes in a high-quality chromosomal suspension. Nevertheless, slide preparations of the chromosomes were not suitable for conventional FISH because the nuclear integrity and chromosomal morphology was destroyed. Our newly developed, simple and efficient FISH-IS technique employs fluorescently labeled, synthetic short sequence repeats that are hybridized with suspended, acetic-acid-pretreated chromosomes for 1 h at room temperature. The method can be successfully used to discriminate single chromosomes or specific chromosomal regions, depending on the specificity of the repeat sequences used as probes. The combination of FISH-IS and flow sorting will improve genomic studies of dinoflagellates, overcoming the difficulties posed by their huge genomes, including long stretches of non-coding sequences in multiple copies and the presence of high-copy-number tandem gene arrays."
https://openalex.org/W2898435044,"The purpose of this research was to examine whether the local food environment, specifically the distance to the nearest sugar sweetened beverage (SSB) vendor, a measure of SSB availability and accessibility, was correlated with the likelihood of self-reported SSB consumption among a sample of fast food consumers. As part of a broader SSB behavior study in 2013-2014, respondents were surveyed outside of major chain fast food restaurants in New York City (NYC). Respondents were asked for the intersection closest to their home and how frequently they consume SSBs. Comprehensive, administrative food outlet databases were used to geo-locate the SSB vendor closest to the respondents' home intersections. We then used a logistic regression model to estimate the association between the distance to the nearest SSB vendor (overall and by type) and the likelihood of daily SSB consumption. Our results show that proximity to the nearest SSB vendor was not statistically significantly associated with the likelihood of daily SSB consumption, regardless of type of vendor. Our results are robust to alternative model specifications, including replacing the linear minimum distance measure with count of the total number of SSB vendors or presence of a SSB vendor within a buffer around respondents' home intersections. We conclude that there is not a strong relationship between proximity to nearest SSB vendor, or proximity to a specific type of SSB vendor, and frequency of self-reported SSB consumption among fast food consumers in NYC. This suggests that policymakers focus on alternative strategies to curtail SSB consumption, such as improving the within-store food environment or taxing SSBs."
